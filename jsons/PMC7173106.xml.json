            "text": "Many organisms cause respiratory tract infections. The common cold is a self-limiting infectious disease caused by more than 100 different viruses (Roxas & Jurenka, 2007). Of these, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are responsible for approximately 50\u201370% of all colds. On the other hand, flu is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (serotypes A and B). In particular, influenza A viruses (IFV-As) cause recurrent epidemics with substantial human morbidity and mortality, and are associated with pandemics. In fact, a novel swine-origin IFV-A (H1N1) emerged as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century (Dawood et al., 2009). In addition, H5N1 viruses (\u2018avian flu\u2019), which are also currently circulating, are extremely virulent in humans but have not yet acquired the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission. In order to overcome these respiratory infectious diseases, development of novel methodologies for preventing or curing such \u2018slight\u2019 condition is very important.",

Together with their nutritional benefits, they have received attention for their potencies as medicinal and functional foods. Indeed, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate their biological activities, including their antioxidant, antifungal and antimicrobial effects (Aoyama and Yamamoto, 2007, Iciek et al., 2009, Kyung, 2011, Sang et al., 2002). Among them, the Welsh onion (Allium fistulosum L.) is a very popular vegetable in East Asian countries, and it has been recorded as a crude drug in oriental medical dictionaries for abdominal pain and phlegmon. In addition, Welsh onion has been used as a folk remedy for the common cold in Japan. These traditional usages of A. fistulosum suggest that it might contain active substances that contribute to the prevention and/or cure of respiratory infectious diseases, including flu.",

W was dissolved in H2O and then dialysed against H2O (MWCO, 14,000).

In vivo anti-influenza A virus effects were evaluated as follows: Female BALB/c mice (5 weeks old) were obtained from Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan, and an adaptation period of 1 week was set before starting the experiments. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of the University of Toyama under the permission of the Animal Care Committee at the University of Toyama. Mice (n\n = 10 per group) were inoculated intranasally with 50 \u03bcl of viral suspension (2 \u00d7 104\n PFU/mouse). Fructan (0.5 or 1.5 mg/day/mouse) was orally administered twice a day (every 12 h) from 3 days before virus inoculation to 7 days post-inoculation (p.i.). Control mice were treated orally with 0.2 ml of vehicle (H2O) alone. Body weight change and mortality were monitored for 14 days after virus inoculation. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the lung were individually collected after scarification of the animals at 3 (n\n = 5) and 14 days (n\n = 5) p.i. Blood samples were centrifuged at 7000g for 10 min, and sera were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Lung samples were sonicated for 10 s after the addition of 1 \u03bcl of PBS/mg of lung tissue and centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 min to separate the supernatants, which were then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. BALFs were prepared by four washes with 0.8 ml of ice\u2013cold PBS via a tracheal cannula and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants, which were then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.

Although host defence mechanisms are complex, it is known that macrophages are key participants in the function of the innate immune system for responding to the invasion of pathogenic organisms. Thus, we investigated the effects of fructan on the activation of macrophages by measuring NO production which is an antiviral mediator (Akaike & Maeda, 2000). RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were incubated with the fructan for 24 h, and NO concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured using the Griess reaction.

Although there are many studies on the biological effects of inulins, only two reports have shown their antiviral effects against herpes viruses (Lee et al., 2011; Liu, Liu, Meng, Yang, & He, 2004). A common characteristic of these antiherpetic fructans is that they have a branched structure, whereas the fructan from A. fistulosum in the present study is a linear polysaccharide. The antiherpetic activities of the former were thought to be dependent on their branched structure, and the later actually showed no antiherpetic effect in vitro (data not shown).

In the mucosal region, the innate immune system is the most important mechanism in the first line of host defence, and antigen-presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cells possess a pivotal role in responding to infectious pathogens. In particular, macrophages orchestrate a multitude of antiherpetic actions during the first hour of the attack (Ellermann-Eriksen, 2005). NO may inhibit the early stages of viral replication, and thus prevent viral spread, promoting viral clearance and recovery of the host. Interestingly, the administration of the fructan induced NO production in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. Similarly, a fructan from aged garlic has also been shown to possess stimulatory effects on NO production from macrophages (Chandrashekar et al., 2011). Our results on NO release from macrophages are similar to those seen with other immunomodulating polysaccharides (Schepetkin & Quinn, 2006).",
