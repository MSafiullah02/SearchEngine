In particular, respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous different viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens that are indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. Respiratory tract infections are also among the most common infections in humans, with approximately 6\u22129 episodes per year in children and 2\u22124 episodes per year in adults [ 1 ] . These infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality as well as high healthcare costs associated with doctor visits, hospitalizations, treatment, and absences from work and school. Early diagnosis of the etiological agent in a respiratory infection permits effective antimicrobial therapy and appropriate management of the disease.",

Further, molecular testing methodologies that permit multiplexing have the advantage that they allow for simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acid sequences from the same sample in a single reaction vessel. Multiplexed tests reduce the time, labor, and cost of laboratory testing as compared to single reaction detection methods, and in addition to improved ef fi ciency, also have a higher diagnostic yield by the ability to detect multiple infections. Thus, multiplexed molecular assays are an ef fi cient method for the de fi nitive diagnosis of respiratory infections and can also provide information on coinfections and secondary infections. Among the various multiplexing technologies available, microsphere-or bead-based suspension arrays have emerged as a standard molecular multiplexing technology in the clinical microbiology laboratory. As compared to planar arrays, some of the bene fi ts of bead-based arrays include ease of use, low cost, statistical superiority, excellent sensitivity and speci fi city, faster hybridization kinetics, fl exibility in array preparation, and rapid data acquisition [ 2, 3 ] .",

Key drivers for adoption of the xMAP platform include cost savings, labor and work fl ow ef fi ciencies, sample conservation, high sensitivity, and broad dynamic range. The system has the added bene fi t of being an open platform in that assays can be rapidly developed, optimized, and implemented by the end user. The versatility of this open architecture is evidenced by approximately 10,000 peer-reviewed publications describing a variety of applications. As a result, the platform was rapidly adopted for nucleic acid and protein analysis in various laboratory settings, and further, the Luminex \u00ae 200\u2122 system has achieved a 510(k) clearance status for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) applications. The breadth of bioanalytical applications on the platform includes hundreds of commercially available analytes and a vast number of custom assays developed for a global install base of more than 7,000 instruments.

Using precise amounts of each of these fl uorochromes, an array is created consisting of different bead sets with speci fi c spectral addresses. The unique spectral characteristics within individual bead sets allow each bead region to be speci fi cally differentiated from all others in a multiplex. Each bead set can possess a different reactant on its surface and because bead sets can be distinguished by their spectral addresses and each address is associated with a speci fi c analyte or target, they can be combined in a single reaction to measure up to 500 different analytes simultaneously. An additional fl uorochrome coupled to a reporter molecule quanti fi es the biomolecular interaction that has occurred at the bead surface. The con fi guration of an xMAP nucleic assay consists of a suspension array where speci fi c capture oligonucleotides are covalently coupled to the surfaces of the internally dyed bead sets. After completion of assay incubations with a nucleic acid sample and a detectable reporter reagent, the reactions are analyzed within a Luminex reader, classifying the beads based on the spectral address or bead identity (region) and quantifying the bound fl uorophore in the reporter detection channel. The potential for simultaneous detection of 1\u2212500 protein or nucleic acid targets provides for rapid, sensitive, and speci fi c multiplexed molecular analyses.",

Inclusion of a third internal dye has allowed the expansion from the original 100-500 bead regions ( Fig. 42.1 ). Several varieties of fl uorescent bead reagents are available from Luminex. The fundamental MicroPlex \u00ae Microspheres are 5.6 m m polystyrene beads functionalized with surface carboxyl groups for covalent attachment of capture ligands. Most of the currently available xMAP assays were developed on MicroPlex Microspheres. MagPlex \u00ae Microspheres are 6.5 m m superparamagnetic beads functionalized with surface carboxyl groups for covalent attachment of ligands. MagPlex Microspheres exhibit both high performance and low nonspeci fi c binding, and they can be magnetically separated from solution, allowing easy automation of assay processes and simplifying assay wash steps. Microsphere reagents precoupled with unique capture oligonucleotides (oligos) are also available for nucleic acid assay development. These reagents incorporate the use of xTAG \u00ae Technology, a proprietary universal tag sorting system that allows easy optimization, development, and expansion of molecular diagnostic assays and eliminates the need to couple contentspeci fi c capture probes to the beads. xTAG oligos are optimized to be an isothermal set and have minimum cross-reactivity. Earlier assays used MicroPlex-TAG\u2122 Microspheres which are nonmagnetic MicroPlex beads, containing two internal fl uorescent dyes and precoupled with xTAG oligo capture sequences (anti-TAGs). These beads have been replaced with MagPlex-TAG\u2122 Microspheres which are superparamagnetic MagPlex beads, containing two or three internal fl uorescent dyes and precoupled with anti-TAG capture oligos.

The MAGPIX utilizes a fl ow cell and CCD-based optics with magnetic beads for multiplexing up to 50-plex. In the fl ow analyzers, the beads are introduced into a rapidly fl owing fl uid stream and through hydrodynamic focusing, are interrogated individually as they pass by two separate lasers. A 635nm, 10-mW red diode laser excites the fl uorochromes contained within the microspheres and a 532-nm, 13-mW yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser excites the reporter fl uorochrome (R-phycoerythrin, Alexa 532, or Cy-3) bound to the bead surface. High-speed digital signal processing classi fi es the microsphere based on its spectral address and quanti fi es the reaction on the microsphere surface. Multiple readings are made per microsphere set, providing valid and robust statistics. Thousands of microspheres are interrogated per second resulting in a system capable of analyzing and reporting up to 500 different reactions in a single reaction vessel in just a few seconds per sample.",

Direct hybridization is the simplest assay chemistry that can provide single nucleotide discrimination and takes advantage of the fact that the melting temperature for hybridization of a perfectly matched template compared to one with a single base mismatch can differ by several degrees for capture oligos approximately 15\u221220 nucleotides in length [ 11, 12 ] . The reaction kinetics can be adversely affected by immobilization of the reactant on a solid surface but these effects are less severe for bead-based suspension arrays; however, the diffusion rate of the immobilized capture probe can be slower and the effective concentration is reduced as compared to free DNA in solution [ 13 ] . Design of sequence-speci fi c capture probes and PCR primers for a direct hybridization assay on the xMAP suspension array can be facilitated through the use of a tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC)-containing hybridization buffer. TMAC stabilizes AT base pairs, minimizing the effect of base composition on hybridization [ 14, 15 ] . For oligos less than 200 base pairs in length, hybridization ef fi ciency in TMAC is a function of the length of the perfect match and less dependent on base composition. Thus, hybridization buffers incorporating 3 or 4 M TMAC equalize the melting points of different probes, allowing probes with different characteristics to be used under identical conditions with high duplex yields [ 16, 17 ] . Typically for single nucleotide discrimination, capture probes are designed to be matched in length at approximately 20 nucleotides. The probes are complementary in sequence to the labeled strand of the PCR product and the polymorphic nucleotide is located at the center of the probe, as mismatches in the center have a more profound effect on the equilibrium state than mismatches near the 5 \u00a2 or 3 \u00a2 end [ 18, 19 ] . Target DNA is PCR-ampli fi ed with one biotinylated and one unlabeled primer. The PCR products are denatured, hybridized to probe-coupled bead sets, and labeled for detection with streptavidin-Rphycoerythrin Optimal assay conditions are determined by evaluating the effect of hybridization temperature, probe length, and input target concentration on assay sensitivity and speci fi city. The probe melting temperature is in fl uenced by length, sequence, and type and position of the mismatched base. The effect of a mismatch on hybridization is greater with increasing temperature and decreasing probe length [ 12, 20 ] . Thus, discrimination can be improved by increasing the hybridization temperature and/or decreasing the probe length. After testing known DNA samples under a set of standard hybridization conditions, nucleotides are added to the 5 \u00a2 and/or 3 \u00a2 ends of the probe to improve sensitivity or removed from the 5 \u00a2 and/or 3 \u00a2 ends of the probe to increase speci fi city. The position of the polymorphism within the probe sequence can be adjusted when necessary to avoid formation of secondary structures and adequate speci fi city can usually be achieved when the polymorphic nucleotide is between positions 8 and 14 of a 20-nucleotide probe [ 19 ] .",

In some cases, larger targets (400\u22121,200 base pairs) have been used successfully, suggesting that hybridization ef fi ciency is also dependent on the sequence and overall secondary structure of target [ 21 ] . Hybridization kinetics and thermodynamic af fi nities of matched and mismatched sequences can be driven in a concentration-dependent manner [ 22 ] . At concentrations beyond the saturation level, the hybridization ef fi ciency can decrease presumably due to competition of the complementary strand and renaturation of the PCR product [ 20, 23 ] . Therefore, it is also important to determine the range of target concentrations that yield ef fi cient hybridization without sacri fi cing discrimination.",

This format involves the incorporation of a speci fi c capture sequence during the enzymatic step that allows hybridization to a complementary \"address\" sequence on the bead surface. Commonly used enzymatic methods for sequence determination rely on the discriminating ability of DNA polymerases and DNA ligases, and include allele-speci fi c or target-speci fi c primer extension (ASPE or TSPE), oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), single base chain extension (SBCE), and target-speci fi c PCR (TS-PCR) [24] [25] [26] . This approach takes advantage of solution-phase kinetics and permits the addressed bead sets to be used in many different assays where new sequences can be targeted by adding the appropriate capture sequence to the target-speci fi c oligo used in the enzymatic step. Hybridization buffer and reaction conditions for detection are dependent upon the capture sequences attached to the microspheres. Commercially available Luminex MagPlex-TAG Microspheres, precoupled with xTAG capture oligos (anti-TAGs) are compatible with solution-based enzymatic chemistries.

In TSPE, a thermostable polymerase is used to extend the primer by incorporation of dNTPs, including one which is biotin-labeled. Extension only occurs if the 3 \u00a2 nucleotide of the primer is complementary and can anneal to the template DNA. OLA employs the same oligo design but a thermostable ligase is used to ligate a biotin-labeled oligo (reporter probe) that is complementary to the sequence downstream from the target nucleotide. The reporter probe is designed to be matched in melting temperature at 51\u221256 \u00b0C, is phosphorylated at the 5 \u00a2 end to provide a substrate for ligase, and is biotin-labeled at the 3 \u00a2 end for fl uorescent detection with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. For SBCE, individual reactions must be set up for each of the four possible nucleotides and a thermostable polymerase is used to incorporate a single biotin-labeled ddNTP. Extension occurs only if the nucleotide complementary to the sequence immediately downstream of the primer is present in the reaction. Targets for SBCE can be combined for each of the nucleotide reactions and if different capture sequences are used for each, the products can be multiplexed for capture onto the addressed microsphere sets. For TS-PCR, target sequences are directly ampli fi ed and labeled by PCR using one primer containing both capture and target-speci fi c sequences paired with a biotinylated target-speci fi c primer. This method requires a strategy which minimizes or eliminates production of the capture sequence in the nontarget strand, which would compete for hybridization of the target to the addressed bead.

Coinfections were found in 27 % of the specimens tested. Using multiple statistical methods, they determined patterns of association between pathogens found in individual specimens. Potential positive correlations were found for specimens coinfected with the following: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus in fl uenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and Flu-B, and CVEV and RhV. In addition, while overall prevalence for S. pneumoniae was 20 %, prevalence was 26 % in RSV B positive specimens. Although the results were preliminary, the authors concluded that the data support the hypothesis that coinfection with multiple respiratory pathogens is medically relevant and that effective treatment for severe respiratory infections may require diagnosis of all pathogens involved, rather than single-pathogen reporting protocols where diagnostic testing is discontinued after identi fi cation of the fi rst relevant pathogen.",

Wong et al. used the RVP assay in a retrospective study of 1,108 specimens from 244 suspected respiratory virus outbreaks to assess utility for enhanced respiratory outbreak investigation [ 41 ] . When used in combination with DFA and various in-house nucleic acid ampli fi cation tests (NATs), RVP testing improved detection of a viral etiological agent from 72.5 to 90.8 % of outbreaks. The RVP assay also proved to be an effective aid for the detection of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 strains [42] [43] [44] . While the assay can detect the matrix gene of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1, it cannot identify the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 in clinical specimens. In New York during the 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 outbreak, the RVP assay was used to test 375 samples that initially tested positive for Flu-A by rapid antigen tests, DFA, and culture, or were from patients with suspected infection. RVP identi fi ed 201 samples as Flu-A, with 60 identi fi ed as seasonal (H1 and H3) strains but the remaining 141 were unsubtypeable (negative for both H1 and H3). The CDC real-time RT-PCR assay speci fi c for 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 was used to further test 101 of these specimens and 99 were identi fi ed as positive for 2009 Flu-A/H1N1. These data indicated that the predictability of unsubtypeable Flu-A identi fi ed by the RVP assay to be pandemic Flu-A/H1N1 was high. Implementation of RVP screening in the testing algorithm enabled the laboratory to rapidly subtype Flu-A, rule out seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes, detect additional respiratory viruses, and identify probable pandemic Flu-A/H1N1 cases.",

RVP FAST uses TS-PCR chemistry where a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction is performed using target-speci fi c upstream primers containing a TAG capture sequence paired with biotinylated downstream primers to amplify the target sequences in a single reaction. The ampli fi ed product is added to a combined hybridization/detection reaction containing the corresponding anti-TAG bead sets and streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin reporter, and then the completed reactions are read on the Luminex analyzer to determine the MFI signal. The raw fl uorescence values are then analyzed using TDAS for RVP FAST software and each target interpreted as present or absent. The RVP FAST assay combines ampli fi cation with target-speci fi c extension, and uses a combined hybridization and detection step, resulting in a turnaround time of less than 5 h (including nucleic acid extraction).

At least one respiratory virus was detected in 13.6 % of specimens by culture and DFA combined, in 49.7 % by real-time RT-PCR, and in 46.2 % by RVP FAST. Using real-time RT-PCR results as the gold standard, RVP FAST had 78.8 % sensitivity and 99.6 % speci fi city. Specimens not detected by RVP FAST generally had low viral loads or contained AdV. For some viral targets, few positive samples were available in the set tested, which suggests that further study using larger numbers of positive samples is needed to fully assess sensitivity of RVP FAST for all targets. Overall, the investigators found RVP FAST to be rapid and easy to perform in comparison to the multiple real-time RT-PCR assays that would be required for equal target coverage. Pabbaraju et al. compared RVP FAST with the original RVP assay on 334 respiratory specimens that had been previously characterized for a variety of respiratory virus targets [ 48 ] . Samples were tested in parallel by both assays and the RVP assay was found to be more sensitive than RVP FAST for the combined targets, with sensitivities of 88.6 and 77.5 %, respectively. However, RVP FAST was tenfold more sensitive for the detection of RSV A. Targets not detected by RVP FAST were primarily Flu-B, PIV-2, and CoV 229E. In addition, a small number of samples positive for Flu-A, RSV B, hMNV, and PIV-1 were not detected by the RVP assay and generally had low viral loads. Reproducibility was similar between the two assays but RVP FAST exhibited better reproducibility for detection of AdV at the LoD. The authors concluded that RVP FAST met the diagnostic needs for sensitivity and speci fi city in their laboratory with the exception of Flu-B, which had decreased sensitivity for Flu-B in specimens collected in 2010. Reduced sensitivity for PIV-2 and CoV 229E was of lesser concern because PIV-2 has low prevalence and detection of CoV 229E does not affect established patient management protocols. Their preliminary studies also indicated that use of RVP FAST will lead to cost savings and improved turnaround time as a result of the shorter protocol and a reduction in hands-on time to 1.5 h.",

As an example, the emergence of antiviral resistance in in fl uenza has raised concerns about use of antiviral drugs and treatment in response to future pandemic outbreaks. Amantadine resistance has increased dramatically for Flu-A/H3N2 and Flu-A/H1N1, and increasing oseltamivir resistance for seasonal Flu-A/H1N1 has been reported worldwide since 2007 [49] [50] [51] . Currently, resistance testing is done by sequencing or phenotypic assays which can be costly and time consuming; however, a multiplexed bead-based array could be applied for this purpose in combination with or in addition to a comprehensive respiratory viral panel. This is illustrated in a report of a multiplexed bead-based LDT that was developed for simultaneous identi fi cation of Flu-A subtypes and the oseltamivir resistance genotype [ 52 ] . The assay employed the use of degenerate primers for ampli fi cation of the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes and eight target-speci fi c primers with TAG modi fi cations for TSPE and subsequent detection on MicroPlex-xTAG beads. The assay was evaluated using 54 NP specimens that were Flu-A positive by DFA or real-time RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and was capable of correctly identifying the Flu-A subtype and the oseltamivir sensitive (H275) and resistance (H275Y) alleles in all samples. Of the 17 seasonal Flu-A/H1N1 isolates, H275Y was identi fi ed in 15, and of the 24 pandemic 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 isolates, 12 were H275 (sensitive), 3 were H275Y (resistant), and 9 revealed a combination of both alleles. The assay was also inexpensive to run with a combined reagent cost of $6.95 Canadian dollars (CAD) per test.",

            "text": "Cost analysis studies indicate that use of a multiplexed bead-based array for diagnosis of respiratory viral infections can be less expensive than routine strategies using DFA and/or culture. A 2009 cost analysis revealed that the average diagnostic cost per pediatric inpatient was lowest for a strategy using xTAG RVP testing alone as compared to DFA alone, DFA plus culture, and DFA plus RVP assay [ 53 ] . When all four diagnostic strategies were compared, RVP alone was the least costly strategy when the prevalence of infection was 11 % or higher but DFA alone was less costly when the prevalence was less than 11 %. They estimated a savings of $291 CAD per case if the xTAG RVP test alone was used to replace DFA plus culture, and a savings of $529,620 CAD per year in direct costs for the four hospitals included in the study. An operational work fl ow analysis using lean methodology principles was employed in another study to evaluate potential advantages of a multiplexed bead-based array for laboratory work fl ow and associated cost [ 54 ] . Implementation of the RVP assay resulted in a standardized work fl ow that decreased laboratory costs and improved ef fi ciency as compared to DFA and culture for diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Work fl ow was evaluated in terms of total hands-on time and number of operator steps, and all hospital and laboratory costs associated with testing were calculated for each test for both positive and negative result scenarios. Combining the scores for all samples included in the analysis revealed that the hands-on time to completion for 1,015 samples was 80 h for RVP as compared to 503 h for DFA and culture. Total cost per sample was $99.75 United States dollar (USD) for DFA-positive samples (no culture or additional testing performed) and ranged from $329.68 to $429.07 USD for DFA-negative samples which are re fl exed to culture with variable time to completion. The total cost for RVP was $135.03 USD, regardless of result. Further, although RVP required more time, steps, and was slightly more expensive per test than DFA screening alone, only 23 % of the sample population studied were DFA-positive. The additional time and costs associated with follow-up culture for the large percentage of DFA-negative specimens were far greater. Thus, the bead-based array assays not only provide increased diagnostic capability for respiratory viral infections but can also maximize ef fi ciency and reduce the costs associated with diagnosis.",

Among these, multiplexed bead-based suspension arrays have emerged as a rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective means to provide physicians with reliable and actionable results for timely and improved patient care. In particular, bead-based suspension array assays have been demonstrated as a method of choice for the comprehensive detection and identi fi cation of respiratory viruses and have improved diagnosis, allowed identi fi cation of coinfections, provided valuable epidemiological data, and aided in the response to outbreaks of respiratory infections. With the availability of assays cleared for IVD use, this technology should become easy to implement, even in diagnostic laboratories with limited experience in molecular techniques. It can be anticipated that as new assays are developed and existing assays are continually enhanced and improved with simpler protocols, streamlined work fl ows, and automation, these assays will continue to prove valuable for diagnosis of respiratory viruses and other infectious diseases.",
