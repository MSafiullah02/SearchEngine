Interestingly the universal recommendations to delay/prevent the spread COVID-19 infection are careful hand-washing, self-isolation and mass testing, free at the point of entry. So, in spite of all our modern interventions, careful hand-washing is the critical modality. When I was in charge of our National HCT in Dublin I found that the most difficult task was to convince health-care workers that hand-washing was of paramount importance in preventing the spread of disease. Personal protective equipment is recommended for all health-care workers who are dealing with COVID-19 infected patients. Hopefully we will not have to revert to the type of clothing worn by so-called 'Plague Doctors' Fig. 2 but it is remarkable how similar the strategy is.",

Viticulturists, like infectious disease experts and microbiologists, usually think of isolation as the identification of infectious agents which can have a devastating effect on vine yield. However, some wine growing areas are geographically isolated and this may be advantageous. Certain parts of Chile are so remote that the vines escaped the phylloxera epidemic [4] which devastated many vineyards all over the world. The elevation of vineyards in Mendoza (Argentina) where the elevation varies from 600 to 1000 m (2000-3600 ft) produce some excellent wines. Planting vines at high altitudes exposes them to more sunlight and may reduce the incidence of pests. Malbec wines from Mendoza will be known to many of you. The grape originated in Cahors in France where it is called Auxerrois or C\u00f4t and probably came to Argentina in the 19th century. Prior to the phylloxera pandemic it was one of the most widely grown grapes in Bordeaux. High-altitude vineyards are also being planted in China and India as well as Bolivia and other parts of South America. Eradicating nematodes from soil is extremely important in isolating vines from nepovirus infection causing fanleaf degeneration [5] .",
