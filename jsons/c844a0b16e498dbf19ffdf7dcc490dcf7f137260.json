Emergence can correspond to the appearance of new viruses or can rely on migrations of people, reservoir, or vectors, on new environmental conditions, new behaviors, or new medical practices. Alternatively, emergence can reflect an improved awareness by clinicians of the disease, which leads to an increase in testing and diagnosis. Finally, emergence can rely on the implementation of new diagnostic tools that reveal levels of incidence and prevalence previously underestimated. Recent decades have been very favorable for the emergence of viral agents and viral diseases. Notably, urbanization and globalization have shown dramatic expansions [12] . Concurrently, new technologies and medical practices have been implemented or their use has been increasing, as is the case for organ transplantation [5] , and the tools for scientific and medical information have grown significantly [13, 14] .

BKV was first isolated in 1970 from a KTR who presented with a ureteral stenosis [17] . The virus was named BKV after the initials of this patient (Table 1) . BKV was discovered well before the clinical consequences of infection could be appreciated in KTRs. In 1993, the first case of BKV interstitial nephritis was diagnosed by a renal allograft biopsy in a patient with acute renal failure [18, 19] . Infections with BKV and JCV occur early in life and are benign [20] . In blood donors, the IgG seroprevalence was 82% and 58% for BKV and JCV, respectively, whereas viruria rates were 7% and 19%. Neither BKV nor JCV was detected in plasma [21] . The distribution of latent viruses in different tissues is thought to occur during the primary viremia. The best-known site of BKV and JCV latency is the urogenital tract, and BK viral sequences can be detected in the bladder, in prostate tissues, and in kidneys (in up to 57%) procured from asymptomatic individuals [22] [23] [24] . After KT, the incidence of viruria increased to 35% for JCV and 16% for BKV, and infection by one polyomavirus was negatively associated with reactivation of the other [16] . BKV reactivation most likely occurs in the cells of the donor kidney [20] . years of BKVAN emergence, misdiagnosis of acute cellular rejection instead of viral nephritis likely resulted in unnecessary antirejection treatment that could inflate rates of allograft loss of 50%-100% recorded in earlier studies. A proactive approach to accurate and early diagnosis has decreased the incidence of BKVAN-related graft loss to less than 10% [27] . Reactivation of BKV in the ureter can manifest as a ureteric stenosis, and in the bladder, it can manifest as a hemorrhagic cystitis [30] .

This pandemic H1N1 has been characterized as a reassortant virus with genes from swine, avian, and human influenza viruses [87] . Severe disease has been noted in children, pregnant women, and people with comorbid disorders including chronic lung or heart disease, diabetes, and obesity [88] . In SOTRs, pandemic H1N1 resulted in a spectrum of illness ranging from mild and selflimiting to severe disease. The largest study reported data on 237 SOTRs from North America; of which, the majority (37%) was KTRs [89] . The most common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, myalgias, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, and headache. Lung imaging showed pneumonia in 32% of patients. H1N1 was diagnosed by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs ( Figure 4 ). The incidence of hospitalization was 71%, and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit was 16%. Of these patients, 21 needed mechanical ventilation. Two adults and one child received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The type of transplant in these patients was not specified, but it did not seem to affect the outcomes. Ten adults died (7%). The overall mortality rate was 4%. Different studies showed that morbidity and mortality observed in KTRs and non-immunocompromised patients infected with pandemic H1N1 were similar [90] . WNV is an example of a previously known pathogen whose emergence is related to epidemiological factors that favored its spread. The appearance of WNV in New York in 1999 and the panzootic that followed have drawn attention to this virus, which was isolated for the first time in 1937 in a woman suffering from fever in the province of West Nile in Uganda (Table 1 ) [91] . Whereas WNV fever may be a real emerging disease in the Americas with a peak of activity in 2003 that affected 9862 persons, including 2866 cases of neuroinvasive disease and 264 deaths [92] , in the Old World, less than 200 human deaths have been recorded over the past decade [93] . Birds are the primary reservoir of WNV (Figure 4) , and mosquitoes are the vectors, acquiring the infection by feeding on a viremic bird and transmitting it to humans from bites. In immune-competent individuals, 80% of the infections are asymptomatic, whereas 20% have a self-limited febrile illness that may be accompanied by a maculopapular rash [94] .

All the patients with a positive respiratory specimen had acute upper respiratory tract infection, but none of these samples were tested for any acute respiratory virus [142] Prevalence of WU and KI polyomaviruses was determined in immunocompromized patients. KI polyomavirus was detected in 16 of the 200 patients by RT-PCR. One of them was a 72-year-old KTR that presented with an acute upper respiratory tract infection and was co-infected with human rhinovirus. The sample positive for the viruses was a NPA [143] due to systematic screening of samples (Table 5 ). In the latter case, the viruses were found from human samples collected during authenticated infectious syndromes or from laboratories but without clinical data. The clinical significance of newly discovered viruses without accompanying clinical data is often unknown. In contrast, new viruses that have been discovered in human outbreaks are clearly pathogens, and 66% are zoonotic (Table 4) . Among viruses discovered after 1990, HHV-8 is the only virus to clearly cause an emerging disease in KTRs. Very few new respiratory viruses have been studied in KTRs ( Figure 5 ), and we have summarized these studies in Table 6 . However, community exposure of KTRs to respiratory viruses is important. The consequences of respiratory viral infections include higher rates of viral pneumonia in KTRs than in immune-competent individuals and increased risk of superinfection with bacterial and fungal pathogens [8] .

Apart from HHV8, the viruses that have been discovered over the last two decades are infrequently involved in clinical diseases in KTRs. Nonetheless, in favorable circumstances, the pathogenicity of a newly discovered virus can fully express itself long after its discovery.

These technologies are helpful in detecting new or old pathogens in undiagnosed infections [116] and are also influential in conducting technology-based research [117] .

The prevalence of PML does not seem to be increasing in KTRs, despite increasing use of mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab (a mAb directed against CD20 in B cells), which have been the objects of safety alerts regarding potential associations with PML [40,41]. PML is a demyelinating disease of the CNS, and the pathological lesions are typically demyelinated plaque areas with irregular borders surrounded by macrophages and bizarre-appearing glial cells that have enlarged nuclei with typical polyomavirus inclusions [36]. The PML symptoms appear at a median time of 37 months after KT (range 5-120 months) [36]. The most common symptoms are hemiparesis, cognitive impairments, visual disturbances, ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, and seizures [36]. On magnetic resonance imaging, PML lesions typically appear hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences (Figure 4) and hypointense on T1-weighted sequences. The lesions are located in subcortical and deep white matter and are usually multiple and bilaterally distributed [42]. PML is definitively diagnosed by detecting JCV DNA in the CSF or on cerebral biopsy [43]. The clinical course of PML is progressive and nearly always fatal. Nine of the 13 KTRs with PML died, eight within 5 months of the diagnosis [36].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Yearly number of publications about newly discovered respiratory viruses in KTRs.

Thus, it is unlikely that the increase in the incidence of BKVAN is merely the result of increased awareness. The prevalence of BKVAN in recent studies is between 1% and 10% [25,27].
