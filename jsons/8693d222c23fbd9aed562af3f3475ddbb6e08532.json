The alignment of the obtained multiplex PCR amplicon with the reference genome of HEV-C104 AK11 and HEV-A, B, C, and D consensus sequences (Bailey & Tapprich, 2006) revealed several differences in the nucleotide sequences. The sequences of the retrieved amplicon of the FTD21 HEV reaction suggest that the kit utilizes a forward primer that extends to position 433 and a probe up to position 488, where the sequences in HEV-C104 strains differ at several locations compared to the HEV consensus (Fig. 3) .

Two distinct groups within the HEV-C serotype have been described causing either respiratory or gastrointestinal disease.

Other viruses reported by our metagenomic approach and of potential clinical relevance were KIPyV and TTV. KIPyV is frequently identified in patients with respiratory symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals (Mourez et al., 2009 ). However, a clear link between detection of KIPyV and respiratory symptoms is yet to be established (Bialasiewicz et al., 2007; Hormozdi et al., 2010) . TTV viremia has been suggested to correlate with the intensity of immunosuppression, as several recent studies reported a higher level of Anelloviridae (with a predominance of TTV) in transplant recipients with more intense immunosuppression (Burra et al., 2008; De Vlaminck et al., 2013; Focosi et al., 2014; G\u00f6rzer et al., 2014) . Our analysis also reported the presence of some plant viruses such as pepino mosaic virus, which may be due to food uptake, and bacteriophage sequences, which are expected to occur in abundance due to the presence of commensal bacterial species (Table 1) . The interpretation of the multiplex PCR results first suggested an HRV infection, as the HEV signal was below the threshold of detection and the HRV signal was clearly positive. Due to cross-reactivity issues of this assay, however, if both HEV and HRV are positive, samples are recorded Enterovirus positive. Most detection systems described for enteroviruses target the 5\u2032 noncoding part of the genome. High sequence homology in this region between HRV and HEV is responsible for the observed cross-reactivity within multiplex assays (Brown et al., 2009; van Doornum et al., 2007) . In addition, for HEV-C104, it was previously reported that its genome could neither be amplified with standard Enterovirus-specific PCR nor with VP1-specific primers that are routinely used to type enteroviruses (Tapparel et al., 2009b) . Alignment of the predicted amplicon sequences of the FTD21 kit identified several nucleotide differences compared to HEV-C104 strains. Although the exact sequences of primers and probe(s) used in the FTD21 kit are not available, these mutations are the most likely explanation for the observed low efficiency of amplification of the patient's HEV-C104 strain (Fig. 3) . Of course, in a routine diagnostic setting, it is not feasible even with multiplex assays to have type-specific primers and probes available for the detection of all rare virus isolate that might be clinically relevant (Whiley et al., 2008) . This is where metagenomic diagnostics step in as it is more comprehensive in detecting virus isolates with sequence Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the patient's isolates cluster within HEV-C104 strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene of 4 isolates from patient kvv585 and selected HEV-C104 strains. Alignment of strains and bootstrapping was performed with MegAlign (clustal W). Isolates detected in this study contain the code of the patient, the weeks after transplantation, and the sample type. TS = throat swab; NS = nasal swab; ST = stool. variation that otherwise could be insufficiently detected or even missed by specific routine tests.
