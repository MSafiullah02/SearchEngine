Urbanization improves living quality but also spontaneously increases the demand on natural resources (World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 2010). To address such urbanization issue, high-density living that enables cities to utilize resources more efficiently by decreasing traffic cost and other energy usage is a viable alternative (Betanzo 2007). However, high-density living may lead to congested urban conditions, which in term are associated with serious environmental issues, such as poor outdoor natural ventilation (Ng 2009a). Taking Hong Kong as an example, the extremely rapid and successful growth of Hong Kong in the last century had led to the increase of high-rise compact buildings and deep street canyons (Fig. 5.1), which significantly block airflow in the urban canopy layer (Fig. 5.2).\n\n",

Outdoor thermal comfort under typical summer conditions requires 1.6 m/s wind speed; however, a decrease in wind speed from 1.0 to 0.3 m/s during the summer could result in 1.9 \u00b0C increase in temperature (Cheng et al. 2011). Wind data from urban observatory station of Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) indicates that the mean wind speed at 20 m above the ground level in a urban area (i.e., Tseung Kwan O) has decreased by about 40%, from 2.5 to 1.5 m/s over the past decade (Hong Kong Planning Department (HKPD) 2005\n). Due to poor dispersion, frequent occurrences of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO2 and respirable particles (RSP), in urban areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay have been reported by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (Yim et al. 2009b).",

Since the outbreak, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government strived to improve the local wind environment for better urban living quality. Relevant studies, policies, and technical guidelines, such as Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) and Sustainable Building Design (SBD) Guidelines, have been conducted and applied on the urban planning and design process (Ng 2009b). The Hong Kong Planning Department (HKPD) initiated the \u201cFeasibility study for establishment of Air Ventilation Assessment system\u201d in 2003 to answer the fundamental question of \u201chow to design and plan our city fabric for better natural air ventilation?\u201d (HKPD 2005). In that study, the current air ventilation issues in Hong Kong were provided, and the corresponding qualitative urban design methodologies and guidelines were given in order to create an acceptable urban wind environment. Unlike AVA, the SBD Guidelines (under APP-152 of Buildings Department HKSAR) are intended for building scale, providing the quantitative requirements for three building design elements, namely, building separation, building set back, and site coverage of greenery. The SBD Guidelines (1) aim to mitigate the negative effects of new building development on the existing surrounding wind environment, (2) enhance the environmental quality of living spaces in Hong Kong, and (3) enable architects to mitigate the undesirable effect of new buildings without needing CFD simulation and wind tunnel experiments by modifying simple design indexes (e.g., building length, distance to the adjunct streets or site boundary, width of the building gap, and size of wind permeability) from the Guidelines.",

Not only is CFD a well-established environmental research tool to enhance our predictive power, it is also a recognized design tool for urban planners and designers (Murakami 2006). With CFD, highly unsteady and three-dimensional turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary can be simulated. In the following sections, three main CFD methods, which are Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) are discussed.",

            "text": "Compared with laminar flows, the fluctuation of turbulent flows is on a broad range of spatial and temporal scales (Ferziger and Peric 2002; Murakami 2006). In DNS, all spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence motions are directly computed by Navier\u2013Stokes equations without any approximations by turbulence models (Ferziger and Peric 2002). Because of this, DNS is the most accurate among all of the simulation methods. However, using the DNS model to totally reproduce turbulence is extremely expensive. On the other hand, the LES method separates the turbulence flow into large and small scales, and only focuses on the \u201c large eddy\u201d that is larger than grid size. Small eddies, such as eddies in Kolmogorov scales, are eliminated from the solution to reduce computational cost. The unresolved scales of turbulence flows are approximated by the sub- filter-scale turbulence models (Meneveau and Katz 2000; Kleissl and Parlange 2004). As a result, LES is computationally cheaper than DNS, and has been used as a research tool in a wide range of engineering applications to simulate high Reynolds flows, such as simulations of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer (Letzel et al. 2008).",

Compared with Mong Kok in 1903, the population density in present day Mong Kok is extremely high, reaching 130,000/km\u22122 (Wikipedia 2011). Given the current planning trend, the population density of this downtown area in the future will be much higher.

In a simplified parametric model, the sloping roof is replaced by a flat floor and 20 m building height. Case 1 refers to the present day Mong Kok in which the height of buildings and podiums is on average 45 and 15 m, respectively (Ng et al. 2011). The site area is not fully occupied, with narrow gap in between. Case 2 refers to future Mong Kok in which the height of buildings on average is estimated to increase to 90 m.

The decreased land use efficiency resulting from the building separations is compensated by higher towers (123 m). Case 5 is the combination of Cases 3 and 4. The stepped podium and building void in Case 6 are popular design strategies in Hong Kong, which are favorable for natural outdoor ventilation and greening.

Different from the classification by Beaufort (cited in Cheng and Ng 2006) and Murakami and Deguchi (1981), in which wind is a kind of \u201cnuisance\u201d, the current parametric study considers wind as a benefit. Therefore, this classification is based on the outdoor thermal comfort and not on the wind force on pedestrians or buildings. Ng et al. (2008) conducted a survey to use physiological equivalent temperature (PET) to obtain the pedestrian-level wind speed threshold values, especially for outdoor thermal comfort in Hong Kong (Hoppe 1999). This survey showed that a wind speed of 0.6\u20131.3 m/s was required to achieve neutral thermal sensation (neutral PET: 28.1 \u00b0C) in a typical summer day with ambient temperature of 27.9 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 80%. In another survey on thermal comfort in Hong Kong (Cheng et al. 2011), the wind speed settings with and without wind break were 0.3 m and 1.0 m, respectively, which equaled to a 1.9 \u00b0C difference in ambient temperature. Based on this literature review, the classification of pedestrian-level wind speed (u) is assigned as the following: Class 1: u < 0.3 m/s for \u201cstagnant,\u201d Class 2: 0.6 m/s > u \u2265 0.3 m/s for \u201cpoor,\u201d Class 3: 1.0 m/s > u \u2265 0.6 m/s for \u201clow,\u201d Class 4: 1.3 m/s > u \u2265 1.0 m/s for \u201csatisfactory,\u201d and Class 5: u \u2265 1.3 m/s for \u201cgood\u201d pedestrian-level natural ventilations in street canyons, respectively.",

The accelerated wind speed is found at street canyons that are parallel with the input wind direction (wind direction 90\u00b0, Fig. 5.11). However, other than these areas, wind speed is significantly reduced in deep street canyons perpendicular to the wind direction. When the input wind direction is changed from 90\u00b0 (Fig. 5.11) to 45\u00b0 (Fig. 5.12, right), air can enter into the streets from both directions (Fig. 5.12), resulting in the decrease in areas with stagnant air. On the other hand, air can enter more deeply into the streets in the wind direction 0\u00b0 (Fig. 5.12, left) than 90\u00b0 (Fig. 5.11), due to the smaller frontal area (please refers to Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-5451-8_2 for more details and definition of frontal area).

Unlike the wind field studies in real urban areas, our study designs a number of parametric models to test the different modification effects on pedestrian-level air flow in street canyons. Compared with other parametric studies in which only one or two buildings are included, this study employs computational modeling in the urban scale to include the effects of the urban context. This study derives a wind speed classification based on the outdoor thermal comfort, as well as uses the relative frequency of the pedestrian-level wind speed and the vertical profiles of the mean wind velocity to evaluate the natural ventilation performance in street canyons. Cross-comparison results suggest that the sensitivity of the wind performance is not the same across different modifications of building morphology. Relevant planning and design strategies are provided based on the findings of this study as follows:\nStreet grid orientation in grid planning is a significant parameter in urban natural ventilation performance. Main streets should be arranged along the prevailing wind direction. Efficiency of the design strategies also depends on the prevailing wind direction, as demonstrated in the results in Sect. 5.3.The mean building height determines the z\n0 + z\nd value in high-density urban areas, while urban ventilation performance from the pedestrian perspective mostly depends on the pedestrian-level building porosity.Overall, decreasing the site coverage ratio increases the pedestrian-level natural ventilation performance. Comparison of Cases 3, 4, and 5 provides a more detailed understanding. The wind profiles in Cases 3 and 4 suggest that building setbacks along the street across the prevailing wind direction (Case 3) are less useful in high-density urban areas than building separations along the prevailing wind direction (Case 4). In contrast, the wind profiles in Case 5 (Fig. 5.8) suggest improvement of the pedestrian-level wind speed on the leeward outdoor space if building separation is incorporated with building setback.\nWind permeability in the podium layer is very useful in leading airflow into deep street canyons. The building void between towers and podiums in Case 6 significantly accelerates turbulent flows in the podium layer, and the stepped podiums lead airflow into the pedestrian level. Airflow across the building void (10 m) is numerically presented by the red lines in Fig. 5.8. The mean wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be improved to recreate the condition in Case 1903.Air passages should be arranged as close to the ground level as possible. Poor wind performance in Case 7 indicates that wind permeability in towers does not improve the pedestrian-level wind environment. Furthermore, compared with the profiles of Case 6, wind passage in the podium layer should incorporate the stepped podium to benefit the pedestrian-level wind environment, or the openings on the facade should be opened from the ground.Building setback, separation, and building permeability are useful in improving the pedestrian-level wind environment. However, the efficiency levels of these strategies differ. The consideration of urban area as a whole is important as natural ventilation performance in urban area results from the integral effects of buildings. Thus, air paths in these areas can be efficiently established and organized by applying different strategies to improve building porosity. Combining strategies (i.e., urban planning + building design) is recommended for the doubled benefits and efficiency over any single strategy. Planners and architects should choose appropriate strategies based on the actual design requirements and the insights from this Chapter.The current study gives scientific insights into the urban ventilation section of the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG) (HKPD 2011), as the Guidelines stress the importance to design urban breezeway and air path with nonbuilding areas and building setbacks from streets. Proper street alignment and sufficient open spaces that can be interlinked are equally important, as well as integration of the urban planning efforts into building-level designs. Building gaps, separations, and porosity close to the pedestrian levels are extremely useful in improving air space for urban air ventilation circulation.Increasing urban density has gained attention in recent worldwide discussions. Traditional wisdom attributes the decline of urban air ventilation to increasing urban density because of high urban frontal area density (FAD). While this understanding is generally correct, balancing the need to reduce land resources demand with designing more compact cities is also useful. The current study provides important insights on fine-tuning and designing urban morphologies and building forms that optimize urban air ventilation. Such optimization process can further incorporate the bio-meteorological needs of air ventilation in different climatic zones (Cheng et al. 2011).Evidence-based decision-making is important, especially for market or policy transformation (Ng 2010; Mills et al. 2010). This understanding is only possible with scientific and parametric studies that examine the sensitivity and performance of various design and planning options. The parameters should be defined carefully and practically to produce realistic results.\n",
