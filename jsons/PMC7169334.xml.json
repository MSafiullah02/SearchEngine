Three days prior to presentation, the owner noted multiple nonpruritic, raised skin lesions. Ocular examination revealed a normal neuro\u2010ophthalmic examination. Schirmer's tear tests (Schirmer Tear Test Strips; Alcon Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) were 13 and 24 mm/min in the right (OD) and left eyes (OS), respectively. The intraocular pressures were estimated with a rebound tonometer (TonoVet; Tiolat, Helsinki, Finland) and were 9 mmHg bilaterally. Slit\u2010lamp biomicroscopy (Osram 64222; Carl Zeiss Canada, Don Mills, ON, Canada) revealed bilateral chemosis and a prolapsed left third eyelid. Aqueous flare was present bilaterally, and fibrin with blood was evident in the right anterior chamber (Fig. 1). Indirect ophthalmoscopic examination (Heine Omega 200; Heine Instruments Canada, Kitchener, ON, Canada) following dilation with 0.5% tropicamide (Mydriacyl, Alcon Canada) revealed multiple foci of chorioretinal cellular infiltration and retinal hemorrhage. The ophthalmic diagnosis was a bilateral panuveitis. Differential diagnoses included inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes. On physical examination, multiple firm, nonpainful, 2\u20135 mm in diameter red papules were noted over the entire body (Fig. 2). Some of the papules were ulcerated. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.",
