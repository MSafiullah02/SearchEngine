However, excessive complement activation may be detrimental because it can contribute to uncontrolled inflammatory responses and lead to tissue damage [3] . As such, complement is an interesting and promising target for the treatment of clinical diseases that are associated with excessive complement activation, such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and transplantation-related and autoimmune disorders [4] [5] [6] . Complement activation may also be a useful target for virus infection-related inflammatory syndromes such as that generated by H7N9. Supporting this are several studies that suggest that patients with severe pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) virus infection exhibit complement activation that closely associates with proinflammatory mediator levels and lung injury severity [7, 8] . In addition, our previous study with a mouse model of H5N1 infection showed that the lung tissue sections and plasma samples of these infected mice had markedly elevated levels of complement activation products [9] . Thus, although complement activation is needed to clear a pathogen, this response could be excessive and could lead to inflammation and tissue injury such as ALI. Complement activation-inhibiting treatments for pathogen-associated inflammatory disorders must thus preserve the pathogen clearance function of this immune arm while inhibiting inflammation and tissue injury.",

Antibody blockade of C5a or C5aR also abrogates the excessive immune responses in the mouse model of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection [15] . Indeed, C5a is a particularly interesting target molecule for treating pathogen-induced inflammatory disorders because blocking it would most likely inhibit the excessive inflammatory responses while leaving membrane attack complex (MAC) formation intact.",

Gross pathology revealed that the lungs of the sham-treated monkeys exhibited multifocal consolidation and dark red discoloration that was particularly prevalent on the dorsal surface of the lungs ( Figure 4A ). By contrast, the lungs of the IFX-1-treated monkeys looked almost normal: there was very little dark red discoloration ( Figure 4D ). Similarly, histopathological analysis showed that by day 3, all infected sham-treated monkeys had developed some pulmonary damage with mild or multifocal bronchointerstitial pneumonia, whereas the IFX-1-treated monkeys exhibited much less lung pathology. Specifically, the sham-treated monkeys exhibited large multifocal lung lesions with desquamation of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, degeneration, and necrosis of the alveolar epithelium, interstitial edema, multifocal hemorrhage, and strong inflammatory infiltration, whereas the IFX-1treated monkeys exhibited mild to moderate expansion of the parenchymal wall with less interstitial edema and significantly less inflammatory cell infiltration ( Figure 4B and 4E) . The remaining 3 sham-treated and 2 IFX-1-treated monkeys were sacrificed on day 7. The sham-treated monkeys exhibited more severe degeneration of bronchiolar epithelial cells and pneumocytes and interstitial edema (especially around the blood vessels) on day 7, whereas the IFX-1-treated monkeys showed only mild expansion of the parenchymal wall with less inflammatory cell infiltration, less pneumocyte degeneration, and no interstitial edema observed ( Figure 4C and 4F) . As previously described [20] , semiquantitative histological analysis of the lungs of the IFX-1-treated and sham-treated monkeys on day 3 confirmed that IFX-1 treatment greatly attenuated lung histopathology ( Figure 4G ).",

Although complement plays an important role in host defense and homeostasis, its excessive or dysregulated activation can be pathogenic [3, 8, 9] . In the present study, we established a monkey model of H7N9 virus-induced ALI that greatly resembled the clinical features of H7N9 viral pneumonia in humans. The lungs and blood of the infected monkeys exhibited extensive complement activation accompanied by severe parenchymal lesions. Thus, excessive complement activation may have contributed to the lung damage observed in the infected monkeys. In support of this, anti-C5a treatment with IFX-1 in this preclinical monkey model substantially attenuated the ALI induced by the H7N9 virus. This observation also indicates that IFX-1 antibody treatment could be an effective intervention for H7N9 viral pneumonia.",

It activates mast cells and basophils and causes their degranulation, which in turn leads to vasodilation and extravasation of fluid. It also participates in endothelial activation and influences the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes [27] . In addition, C5a increases the gene expression and protein synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages, which influences local and peripheral homeostasis [27] . Furthermore, C5a functions as an important chemotactic factor that affects leukocyte migration and induces the synthesis of other chemotactic factors. Several lines of evidence indicate that modulating complement activation by regulating C5a/C5aR or C5 could be a promising target in the treatment of inflammatory disorders [15, 28, 29] .",

However, ZAP contains high concentrations of many other complement activation products, including C3a and C5b-9. The fact that IFX-1 completely blocked ZAPinduced CD11b expression on granulocytes indicates that C5a is a key driver of the granulocyte activation in this inflammatory setting. It also showed that IFX-1 could strongly inhibit eC5a in both humans and monkeys.",

This situation is characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses and higher virus replication [30] [31] [32] . Similarly, the H7N9 virusinfected monkeys in the present study presented with acute pneumonia 3 days after infection, along with significant systemic complement activation and high systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Given the important role of complement in the defense against pathogens and its upstream position in inflammatory homeostasis, our observations suggested that dysregulated complement activation contributes to unbalanced homeostasis, thereby inducing proinflammatory responses and tissue injury. Our study also showed that IFX-1 treatment markedly decreased the inflammatory responses initiated by H7N9 infection and attenuated virus-induced pneumonia. To date, promising treatments for the severe viral pneumonia caused by the SARS, H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses are lacking. Infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome is a hallmark of these diseases; therefore, steroids have been widely used to curb the inflammation. However, follow-up studies have shown that the high doses of steroids used to treat SARS cause osteonecrosis [33] . Thus, effective therapeutic strategies that combat inflammatory responses without inducing significant side effects are needed. IFX-1 has been tested in a monkey toxicological study and in a human phase 1 trial (NCT01319903) and has demonstrated a good safety profile that permits its use in further clinical trials. In clinics, most cases of severe influenza pneumonia have been treated with oseltamivir. Therefore, it is worthwhile to determine the potential synergistic antiviral effect of IFX-1 and oseltamivir and the possible interaction between these 2 drugs in future clinical study.",
