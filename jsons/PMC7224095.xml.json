Acute respiratory failure (ARF) may often occur in patients with acute or chronic neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis (MG), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), polymyositis (PM), or dermatomyositis (DM). In these patients, weakness of diaphragm, intercostal and expiratory muscles, or concomitant pulmonary complications due to oropharyngeal dysfunction causing aspiration of secretions/food/drink or inefficient cough may lead to respiratory emergencies [2]. In all these neurological disorders, respiratory involvement may increase the burden of the existing disease and mortality.",

In this context, a competent multidisciplinary team is fundamental including pneumologist, anesthetist, nurse, physical therapist, and speech therapist. Indeed, these cases not infrequently represent a diagnostic challenge in the acute care settings, especially in a busy ER, because of patients\u2019 poor ability to communicate and scanty experience of health professionals in caring for patients with neurological diseases [3, 4]. Furthermore, increase in survival of patients with SMA and DMD has emphasized the need for a smooth and successful transition from pediatric to adult healthcare [5, 6]. Unfortunately, many healthcare services are not equipped to provide modified age-appropriate assistance and expertise. This is particularly true at ER, leading to an inadequate medical approach and patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 apprehensiveness with loss of the sense of health protection [7, 8].",

As chest wall and pulmonary compliance may be reduced, mechanical load on weakened respiratory muscles (in particular the diaphragm) can be increased. An imbalance between load and capacity leads to muscle fatigue, which in turn elicits an increase in minute ventilation and respiratory rate and, to a lesser degree, a reduction in tidal volume (\u201crapid shallow breathing\u201d), causing hypoventilation and ARF [10, 11].",

Clearing airway secretions and airway mucus can be a continual problem for patients with generalized muscle weakness and for those who cannot swallow saliva or food without aspiration. Indeed, in patients with neurological disorders, inadequate bulbar and expiratory muscle function may cause retained secretions, frequently complicated by pneumonia, atelectasis, and, ultimately, hypoxemic ARF. These conditions can result in hospitalizations, endotracheal intubations, tracheostomy, and death [13]. In rapidly progressing NMDs, ARF due to accumulation of lung secretions (\u201clung failure\u201d) can be the earliest symptom [14]. Cough peak expiratory flow (CPEF) is a measure of the maximum airflow generated during cough and is normally 360 to 1200 L / min; of interest, CPEF may provide valuable information on the ability to clear airway secretions, with values below 160 L/min usually indicating the need for tracheal suctioning and an increased risk of mucous encumbrance at the onset of respiratory infections, contributing to the development of atelectasis and acute hypoxemia [15].",

Weakness after stroke also affects muscles of the respiratory system, and patients typically have altered breathing control, reduced maximal voluntary strength, and decreased endurance of inspiratory and expiratory muscles, as well as altered chest wall kinematics [17, 18]. Associated factors may be impaired vigilance, inefficient cough, aspiration, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolus, and pulmonary edema (neurogenic or cardiogenic) [19]. The risk of respiratory impairment associated to large hemispheric stroke increases after a few days\u2019 delay, as cerebral edema intensifies. Sustained hyperventilation in a patient with mass effect can be a manifestation of diencephalic herniation. Ataxic or cluster breathing patterns can be part of brainstem syndromes, and recurrent apnea is a warning sign in patients with basilar artery occlusion. Cheyne\u2013Stokes breathing, characterized by oscillating cycles of hyperpnea alternating with periods of apnea, is a frequent finding after massive hemispheric stroke [20]. Chest infections, such as pneumonia, are the most frequent complications of stroke and occur in up to one-third of patients, resulting in up to a threefold increased risk of death in the first 30 days, longer hospital stay, and poorer post-discharge outcomes [21].",

The pathophysiology is complex, with the level and completeness of phrenic nucleus injury at C3-C5 level with diaphragm paralysis being the greatest determinant. Full cervical lesions (C2-C4) in the absence of mechanical ventilation are incompatible with life. Cervical lesions under C5 (C5-C8) determine weakness or paralysis only of the intercostal and abdominal muscles. In these cases, the diaphragm is preserved, and spontaneous ventilation is usually maintained. Other responsible factors are accessory muscle weakness due to T1-T12 level injury and abdominal muscle involvement due to T5-T12 injury, impaired cough, decreased surfactant production, and increased secretions and bronchospasm due to unopposed vagal activity (C8-L2 sympathetic nerve injury) [26].",

Chronic RF involves bulbar dysfunction with swallowing disorders, altered central respiratory drive, motor disorders following corticospinal lesions, or sleep-disordered breathing. Acute conditions mainly involve spinal or bulbar relapse with extensive plaques, neurogenic pulmonary edema, or ARF, often following sepsis [29]. Common pulmonary-related complications in encephalitis are poor gag reflex, pooling of secretion, and loss of swallowing, with risk of aspiration pneumonia and RF development [30].",

A reduced ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia related to low ventilatory chemosensitivity and autonomic dysfunction may contribute to the development of ARF [32]. Swallowing impairment exposes PD patients to high risk of aspiration pneumonia that is enhanced by weak cough due to chest wall rigidity, dyskinesia, and upper airway dysfunction. Pneumonia remains the most common frequent cause of death despite the development of effective therapeutic regimen over the past three decades [33]. Although levodopa is the main treatment for PD, improving respiratory and motor functions, development of dyskinesias may affect ventilation inducing dyspnea and chest pain. Moreover, in advanced patients, wearing-off phenomenon may induce pulmonary complaints such as stridor due to UAO and dyspnea due to chest wall tightness.",

Other myopathies at risk are some limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (especially sarcoglycanopathies) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The latter is a complex multi-systemic disease, in which cardiomyopathy and disturbances of central breathing regulation coexist, which make ventilatory management difficult [51]. The autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), related to the 4q region, may develop ARDS generally in early-onset cases [52]. Among metabolic myopathies, Pompe disease caused by mutations of the acid alpha glucosidase enzyme gene is still at risk of RF, despite the availability of enzyme replacement therapy for over 10 years. About a third of cases with infantile-onset (IOPD) in the first year of life require ventilatory support, as well as a minority of cases with adult form [53]. Some adults start with dyspnea and hypercapnic RF and can be diagnosed after acute ventilatory failure. However, all patients should be carefully monitored for respiratory function.

Due to the risk of rapid variation of the patient\u2019s clinical status, continuous monitoring of systemic oxygenation through pulse oximetry is essential. Mechanically ventilated patients should undergo regular arterial blood gas monitoring. The mortality rate of patients with stroke undergoing ETI has been variously reported to be between 40 and 80% regardless of the causes of intubation, with only about 50% surviving 30 days and 30% surviving 1 year [70]. Predictors of death include low GCS at intubation and absent pupillary light reflexes. 15\u201335 % of stroke patients admitted at the ICU require tracheostomy for difficult weaning.

For these reasons, the patient must be intubated, and IMV must be set to maintain normal capnia and oxygenation, to allow the patient to be sedated, reducing intracranial pressure and preventing pulmonary aspiration [73]. Moreover, patients with TBI frequently suffer from lung complications and ARDS, which can be multi-etiological (i.e., aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary contusion related to chest trauma, neurogenic pulmonary edema, transfusion-related acute lung injury). These complications represent a further indication for IMV. Unfortunately, ventilator strategies can have effect on cerebral perfusion and represent a potential burden for iatrogenic secondary brain damage [74]. In particular, when a concomitance of TBI and ARDS occurs, the ventilatory management can be very challenging as ventilatory targets are often in conflict among each other. Ventilator strategies commonly used in patients with ARDS induce a relevant increase in intrathoracic pressures, which may reduce cerebral venous return to the right atrium. This phenomenon may cause a significant increase in intracranial pressure and a harmful decrease in cerebral perfusion. In order to avoid iatrogenic secondary brain damage due to these mechanical ventilation consequences on cerebral dynamics, intracranial pressure monitoring is indicated [75].",

The evidence for use of invasive ventilation via ETI is strong and has been recommended in most of the series published so far; a mortality rate in patients receiving invasive ventilation has been reported between 4 and 6%. Extubation may fail in up to one quarter of patients, and presence of atelectasis has been reported to be strongly associated with extubation failure [81]. Although NIV may be inappropriate in patients with ARF unless upper airway function is well preserved, this option seems desirable in patients with myasthenic crisis because of the increased risk of prolonged IMV complicated with ventilator-associated pneumonia and other systemic complications [82, 83]. Administering NIV with a relatively low inspiratory-pressure range of 10\u201316 cm H2O can be effective in preventing the need for ETI in these patients. Severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 50 mmHg) and high serum bicarbonate concentration at admission have been considered predictors of NIV failure [1, 84].",

The application of NIV in GBS patients is not a safe option for several reasons: (a) patients usually remain extremely weak and require full ventilator assistance for many days, and (b) the manifestations of dysautonomia get worse as RF becomes more severe. Between 25 and 50% of patients require ETI and IMV [85]. Moreover, emergency intubation should be avoided because it can induce life-threatening complications from dysautonomia, including labile blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal hyperkalemia with the use of succinylcholine. The mortality rate of severe GBS causing neuromuscular ARF may still reach 5\u201310%; in addition, 20% of survivors may suffer from long-term disability [86].",
