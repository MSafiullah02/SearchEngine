On surfaces, virus particles remain infectious for hours to days, so that they can reach the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from keyboards, tables, door handles and handles via the hands(lubricating infection). Infection via the conjunctiva of the eye is also possible [1], [2].",

Along these lines, Cilloniz et al. [14] used a mouse model to investigate influenza A virus virulence, comparing host transcriptional responses to infection with reconstructed 1918 H1N1 virus to avian H5N1 virus (Vietnam/1203). They found that extra-pulmonary dissemination was associated with down-regulation of genes involved in mediating the pro-resolution impact of lipoxin on leucocyte recruitment and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and that loss of lipoxin\u2019s pro-resolution actions may be associated with greater influenza A virus virulence. These findings suggest a protective role for SPM in this infection, possibly related to the reduction and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated during viral infections.",

The pro-resolution, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial-enhancing actions of SPM such as the resolvins, protectin and potentially maresins make these appealing candidates for further study in humans and specifically in COVID19 patients. From a therapeutic perspective it is important to note that these pro-resolution mediators have a substantial advantage over steroids for use in the treatment of infectious inflammation, or other systemic inflammatory states, as they are not immunosuppressive agents. Acetylsalicylic acid-triggered lipoxins and resolvins epimers share these pro-resolution actions and act by the same intracellular pathways. [15], [16]. This effect is unique to aspirin, and is not shared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which do not trigger the endogenous biosynthesis of these mediators.",
