Understanding the pathways driving CoV replication and pathogenesis is crucial to combat CoVs with high mortality, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoVs. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototypic CoV, causes hepatitis and/or encephalitis, depending on the strain. Previous studies have detailed many of the cellular pathways critical for or elicited by MHV infection (1, 2). Several antiviral mechanisms are induced by MHV infection, but MHV encodes proteins that counter these host processes. For instance, interferons (IFNs), especially type I IFNs (IFN-I), are vital to limiting MHV infection in mice (3, 4), but IFN-I production and signaling are inhibited during MHV infection in multiple cell types (5\n\u2013\n7). MHV also inhibits the functions of downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). For example, the MHV macrodomain, a virus-encoded ADP-ribosylhydrolase, reverses cellular ADP ribosylation by IFN-I-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that limit viral replication (8, 9).",

While initially believed to operate only in the context of the cellular response to toxins, AhR is now recognized as a significant regulator of the host immune response, as well. AhR in the cytosol is activated by binding ligands that are exogenous, such as the toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), or endogenous, such as cellular metabolites (Fig. 1). This triggers AhR translocation to the nucleus, where AhR complexes with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) or other binding partners to induce expression of several different proteins (downstream effectors) responsible for degrading the xenobiotic agent and for limiting potential cellular damage. Upregulated genes include those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) that catabolize exotoxin, negatively regulating AhR activation by depleting AhR ligands (10). Another inhibitory protein, the AhR repressor (AhRR), is also upregulated and competes with ARNT for AhR dimerization in the nucleus (11). PARP7, also known as TCDD-inducible PARP (TiPARP), is highly induced by AhR activation, as well, indicating a relationship to cellular ADP ribosylation. TiPARP is responsible for mitigating pathology after TCDD administration to mice, at least in part due to feedback inhibition of AhR (12).",

            "text": "In the context of the immune response, endogenous metabolites are likely the primary ligands that drive AhR activation. The prototypical endogenous ligand is kynurenine, a tryptophan catabolite produced by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) or IDO2 in immune cells or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) (encoded by the TDO2 gene) in the liver (13, 14). IDO1, the best characterized of these enzymes, is induced by inflammatory factors, such as IFN-I or IFN-II, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (15). AhR also activates IDO1 expression and enhances its activity through multiple pathways (16), and the resulting IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positive-feedback loop prolongs the effects of AhR activation (17, 18). Though kynurenine is believed to be the predominant derivative of tryptophan that drives AhR activation, multiple other degradation products of tryptophan or other biomolecules are synthesized independently of IDO1/2 or TDO or can be sourced from the gut microflora, diet, or even UV-mediated photo-oxidation (19). Prostaglandins, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and oxidative species may also activate AhR, though with unknown physiological or pathological significance (20\n\u2013\n22).",

AhR activation by chemical agonists has been shown to influence the differentiation (24\n\u2013\n28) and cytokine/chemokine production (25, 26, 29\n\u2013\n32) of T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. AhR has also been shown to bind to and modulate the transcription specificity of NF-\u03baB in multiple experimental settings, which could contribute to cytokine modulation (30, 33\n\u2013\n35). Other studies have shown that AhR activation in immune cells is driven by IDO1, and the resulting IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positive-feedback loop helps to establish immunotolerance (18, 36, 37). In contrast, less is known about the role of AhR during virus infection. While previous work has explored pathways affected by AhR activation during influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (38\n\u2013\n41), the virological impact of AhR is still largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that CoV replication in macrophages results in AhR activation in an IDO1-independent manner, leading to increased expression of several downstream effectors and to modulation of the cytokine response. We also show that TiPARP, induced by AhR, is a proviral factor in CoV-infected cells.",

            "text": "Infection of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with the neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) results in increased expression of several IFN-I-inducible PARPs (PARP7, -9 through -12, and -14) (8). However, PARP7 (TiPARP) was also induced during MHV-JHM infection of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, suggesting that other factors besides IFN-I mediate TiPARP upregulation during infection (8). To expand on these results, we infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma cells (Fig. 2A) or 17Cl-1 fibroblast-like cells (Fig. 2B), both of which minimally produce IFN during MHV infection (6, 7), with the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59). We used MHV-A59 because it replicates to higher titers than MHV-JHM in vitro (42). Upregulation of most PARPs, including PARP9, -11, -12, and -14, was lost or attenuated in these cell lines during infection, contrasting with the robust PARP upregulation profile seen in MHV-A59-infected wild-type (WT) BMDMs (Fig. 2C). Despite the diminished expression of many IFN-dependent PARPs, TiPARP was highly upregulated following MHV-A59 infection in all three cell types, suggesting a conserved mechanism of induction. Furthermore, induction of TiPARP in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs was conserved after infection with MHV-A59, consistent with previous findings with MHV-JHM (Fig. 2D). Although not further studied here, PARP13 was also upregulated in infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 cells. Overall, these results indicate that TiPARP is upregulated by another pathway during infection in the absence of IFN-I signaling.",

To confirm this phenotype, we treated BMDMs with TiPARP-specific siRNA prior to infection with MHV-A59 at low (0.1 PFU/cell) and high (5 PFU/cell) multiplicities of infection (MOI) and measured replication by quantification of viral genomic content and infectious virus (Fig. 3). At low MOI at 12 h postinfection (hpi), TiPARP knockdown decreased viral gRNA levels (Fig. 3A) and titers (Fig. 3B), though the former only trended toward statistical significance. MHV infection at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell showed significantly decreased gRNA levels and virus titers in TiPARP knockdown cells (Fig. 3C and D), indicating a role for TiPARP in facilitating MHV-A59 infection. These differences in gRNA and virus titers persisted even at later time points p.i., when cell viability was decreased, resulting in decreased infectious-virus titers. Furthermore, while IFN-\u03b14 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were unaffected by TiPARP deficiency at low or high MOI at 6 or 12 hpi, they were increased at 18 and 22 hpi (Fig. 3A and C). Together, our results suggest that TiPARP augments MHV replication throughout infection and negatively regulates IFN-I expression during later stages of infection.",

To assess AhR activation during MHV-A59 infection in BMDMs at multiple time points, we quantified the mRNA expression of known effectors downstream of AhR, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, TiPARP, and AhRR (Fig. 1). We also analyzed gene expression of AhR itself and of the AhR ligand-producing enzymes IDO1, IDO2, and TDO, as IDO1 gene expression can also be induced by AhR activation. We found that, while CYP1A1, CYP1A2, IDO2, and TDO2 mRNAs were undetectable at all time points, CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, IDO1, and AhR mRNAs were all upregulated over the course of infection (Fig. 4A). To determine if this response is conserved in other immune cell types, we quantified the transcription of these downstream effectors in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Fig. 4B). At both 12 and 22 hpi, CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, IDO1, and AhR were all upregulated in BMDCs, suggesting that AhR activation occurs following MHV-A59 infection in multiple cell types.",

We first confirmed that CH-223191 inhibited chemical AhR activation by agonist TCDD in BMDMs without altering cell viability (Fig. 6B and C). During MHV-A59 infection, AhR inhibitor treatment resulted in dose-dependent attenuation of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1. Surprisingly, TiPARP induction was not diminished at any concentration of inhibitor. Furthermore, CH-223191 treatment actually increased AhR mRNA levels slightly at 12 hpi but had no effect on gRNA levels, indicating that the CH-223191-mediated reduction in downstream effector expression was due to inhibition of AhR activation itself rather than decreased AhR expression or increased virus replication.",

After confirming that TCDD did not affect cell viability (Fig. 7B), we found that agonist treatment increased expression of CYP1B1 and AhRR compared to vehicle treatment in both mock- and MHV-infected BMDMs. TiPARP mRNA increased following TCDD treatment of uninfected cells and only marginally, if at all, after infection. IDO1 required infection for any expression and was potentiated by TCDD at 22 hpi.

Because IFN-I treatment in BMDMs can induce TiPARP expression (8), we next examined whether IFN-I upregulated TiPARP expression after inhibition of AhR activation. Using MHV-infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs treated with CH-223191, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1 (Fig. 8), confirming that AhR activation did not require IFN signaling. In addition, AhR inhibitor treatment reduced TiPARP induction in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, indicating that AhR and IFN-I were compensatory in inducing TiPARP during infection. However, CH-223191-mediated reduction of TiPARP mRNA levels in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs was less than that of CYP1B1, AhRR, or IDO1, suggesting that an additional, as yet unknown factor modulated its expression. Finally, gRNA levels in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs trended toward a modest reduction following AhR inhibition (P = 0.12), possibly reflecting decreases in TiPARP expression. Taken together, our data show that MHV-induced AhR activation is responsible for upregulation of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1 in IFN-replete and -deficient cells and of TiPARP in the absence of IFN-I signaling.",

To determine if IDO1 has a role in AhR activation during MHV-A59 infection, we infected IDO1\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs with MHV-A59 and quantified effector mRNA levels (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, levels of CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, AhR, and gRNA were equivalent following infection in WT or IDO1\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. As expected, IDO1 mRNA was not detectable in deficient cells. To rule out compensatory effects of other enzymes known to produce kynurenine, we also assessed cells for IDO2 and TDO2 mRNAs but could detect neither in WT or IDO1\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. Together, our results suggest that MHV-A59 infection of BMDMs elicits AhR activation through a pathway independent of IDO1.",

Inhibition of AhR had no impact on expression of IFN-\u03b14/IFN-\u03b2/IFN-\u03b3 mRNAs. On the other hand, CH-223191 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and a concurrent decrease in the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 mRNAs. Because AhR could be further activated by chemical means during infection (Fig. 7), we substantiated these findings by treating BMDMs with TCDD in the presence or absence of infection at low and high MOI (Fig. 10B). Consistent with our AhR inhibitor data, TNF-\u03b1 mRNA was decreased and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 mRNAs were increased by concurrent chemical activation of AhR. In summary, these results indicate that AhR activation modulates multiple cytokine expression levels during MHV-A59 infection.",

TiPARP induction is multifactorial, since IFN-I treatment induced TiPARP expression in BMDMs (8) but TiPARP expression was still observed in cell lines deficient in IFN expression and in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. 2). Our results showed that AhR activation directly induces TiPARP expression, as TCDD treatment enhanced TiPARP expression in uninfected cells and to a lesser extent in infected cells (Fig. 6). Further, TiPARP induction during infection was sensitive to chemical AhR inhibition in the absence, but not the presence, of IFN-I signaling in WT BMDMs (Fig. 6 and 8), consistent with redundant roles for AhR and IFN-I signaling in TiPARP expression during infection. Despite attenuation with inhibitor treatment, TiPARP expression in infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 cells was still induced, indicating that other factors known to modulate TiPARP expression, such as estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, or TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, could also impact its expression during CoV infection (46\n\u2013\n48).",

Further study will be required to establish a causal relationship between the effects of TiPARP on IFN-I expression and replication. Our results align with those of a previous study showing that during IAV infection, TiPARP ADP ribosylates TBK1, resulting in increased replication and reduced IFN-I levels (40). However, TiPARP has also been shown to bind to Sindbis virus RNA to trigger an antiviral host response.

This is evidenced by the fact that expression of these effectors was enhanced by an AhR agonist and attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by an AhR-specific inhibitor (Fig. 6 and 7). While AhR activation has been studied in immune cells following agonist or immunostimulant treatment, its role in the context of virus infection is relatively understudied, and only a few studies have details of host pathways affected by AhR activation. EBV encodes the viral protein EBNA-3, which binds to ARNT and enhances transactivation of downstream effectors by AhR (41). AhR facilitates HCV infection by inducing expression of CYPs that aid in the formation of lipid droplets required for virus production (38). As mentioned above, AhR functions in a proviral manner in IAV infection by inducing TiPARP (40). In contrast, AhR activation in HSV- or HIV-infected macrophages restricts replication by inhibiting expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (39). Thus, AhR activation during viral infection has differing effects and modulates multiple cellular pathways, many of which remain uncharacterized.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, while AhR is thought to be activated primarily by kynurenine synthesized via IDO1 in inflammatory states and can drive positive-feedback cycles in immune cells (17, 18), our results demonstrate that MHV infection activates AhR independently of IDO1 (Fig. 1 and 9). We detected gene expression of IDO2 and TDO2 in infected murine liver samples (Fig. 4C), consistent with the notion that TDO is largely confined to the liver (14). While TDO or IDO2 could be driving AhR activation by producing kynurenine during in vivo infection, IDO2 and TDO mRNAs were undetectable in IDO1\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. This suggests that kynurenine is produced by a novel IDOI/IDO2/TDO-independent pathway in BMDMs or that the cells do not utilize kynurenine as the primary AhR ligand during CoV infection. AhR can be activated by several biochemical species, including metabolites of tryptophan or bilirubin or other metabolites of uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways (49\n\u2013\n52). Other potential initiating pathways include prostaglandin synthesis, cAMP production, and general oxidative stress (20\n\u2013\n22). Alternatively, during infection, a host or viral protein could directly bind to AhR, enhancing its transactivation activity in a manner similar to that of EBV-encoded EBNA-3, though this may still require concomitant ligand binding (41). Nonetheless, the levels of the ligand or binding partner activating AhR in BMDMs would likely scale with replication, as downstream effector transcription was correlated with the virus load (Fig. 5). Additional investigation will be necessary to detail the exact mechanism of this IDO-independent AhR activation pathway. Furthermore, while IDO1 does not regulate AhR activation during MHV infection in BMDMs, it could still be modulating other cellular pathways as part of the host response. For instance, IDO1 has been shown to regulate immune cell function by mediating tryptophan starvation, resulting in activation of mTOR, a mediator of several metabolic and immune pathways (53, 54).",

            "text": "Finally, chemical activation or inhibition of AhR during infection resulted in changes in the mRNA levels of multiple cytokines (Fig. 10), suggesting that AhR functions to modulate the cytokine response to MHV infection. Specifically, AhR negatively regulated TNF-\u03b1 and positively regulated IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10, cytokines that are also upregulated in the brains of MHV-infected mice (2). These changes were not due to alterations in viral replication, as the viral load was unchanged by AhR activation or inhibition. The mechanism driving cytokine changes during MHV infection is likely complex but probably involves interaction of activated AhR with NF-\u03baB (30, 33\n\u2013\n35, 55) (Fig. 1). The effects of these cytokine expression changes will need to be investigated in vivo to determine their roles in pathogenesis, because their functions are protean: some of these cytokines are additionally posttranscriptionally regulated, and activating ligands may differ in cultured BMDMs versus infected mice. Thus, it is difficult to conclude at present that AhR drives a strictly pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype. Rather, AhR activation may serve to fine tune the innate immune response to MHV infection.",

Ligands that can bind to AhR can be exogenous (pentagons), such as toxins like TCDD, or endogenous metabolic products (parallelograms), such as kynurenine derived by IDO1-catalyzed tryptophan degradation. CoV infection produces an unknown AhR-activating ligand independent of IDO1 (triangles). AhR in the cytosol is activated upon ligand binding and translocates to the nucleus to bind to genomic DNA. The specific genes targeted and induced by AhR are influenced by AhR binding partners, including ARNT and NF-\u03baB. Modulated genes include those encoding AhR downstream effectors, such as CYPs, AhRR, and TiPARP, or immune proteins, such as cytokines. AhR activation/ligand binding can be inhibited chemically by treatment with CH-223191.",
