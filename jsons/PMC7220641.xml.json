The authors report some of the cases that presented in Iran during the outbreak from 24th February to 4th March. Being the first cases declared from 19th to 25th February in Iran, there could be more patients affected by COVID-19 that could have undergone bariatric elective surgery at that time without being noticed by surgical teams [3]. In fact, the same authors have reported previously a patient who died with morbid obesity, the day before and elective surgery for gastric bypass in Iran [4] .As most of those affected countries in which systematic detection of COVID-19 by doing RT-PCR was not performed, means that we may be seeing the top of the iceberg by reporting only those cases who developed postoperative pneumonia.",

From the 4 cases included, only the first seems to present with metabolic diseases and respiratory previous pathology. However, usual treatments like 2-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are not reported in the article. Although further evidence is needed due to controversy, ACEIs and ARBs have been proposed to increase expression of ACE2 and therefore to make patients more susceptible to viral hosting and propagation [4]. Moreover, there are several factors in which obesity can play a role in poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Some have proposed that obese patients can present a metabolic dysfunction due to a pro-inflammatory state and also that adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for some human viruses [5].",

Case 4 misses RT-PCR, while chest CT has not been done for case 2. This is a limitation for this early case series that will need to be explored in future perioperative protocols globally [6]. Also, it will be important to take into consideration that some inflammatory parameters such as CRP, white blood cell count, and liver function alterations, as well as pulmonary pneumonia or thromboembolism and collapsed lung, can also be seen in patients presenting with bariatric surgery complications. Therefore, it is important to do a complete differential diagnosis in those patients failing after gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy and to include COVID-19 as one more possibility.",
