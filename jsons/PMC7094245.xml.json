            "text": "Positive stranded RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and encode viral RNA binding proteins. Coronaviruses are no exception and synthesise an RNA binding protein termed the nucleocapsid (N) protein which is one of the most abundantly expressed viral proteins in an infected cell [1]. This protein has multiple functions in the virus life cycle both in terms of interacting with viral RNA [2], [3], [4] and modulating host cell processes [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The replication of the coronavirus genome is complex and involves the direct replication of the genomic RNA (approximately 30 kb in length) and transcription of multiple subgenomic mRNAs via a discontinuous mechanism [11]. The positive sense genome comprises of a coding region flanked by untranslated regions. The 5\u2032 end consists of a short leader sequence and the 3\u2032 end is polyadenylated, both features are shared by the subgenomic mRNAs. N protein also associates with components of the viral replicase (an RNA dependent RNA polymerase) [12] and as such can be viewed as being crucial in the recruitment of viral RNA for replication. Certainly, N protein is required for the efficient rescue of coronavirus full length clones (e.g. [13], [14], [15]) and has direct roles in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis [16], [17]. Kinetic studies utilizing equilibrium reactions and investigation of dynamic interactions (using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)) indicated that the N protein has particular affinity for the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) [2], [18]. This short nucleotide sequence is found within the viral leader sequence and also precedes each open reading frame. Mutation of specific nucleotides within and around the TRS can alter RNA transcription [19], [20], [21], [22].",

For example, the amino-terminal region of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [4], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [23] can interact with RNA, but the kinetics of these interactions remain unknown. Recent studies have hypothesised that the amino-terminal region of N protein has the potential to form an electrostatic interaction with RNA [24] and disruption of this interaction has been proposed to be a target for anti-viral therapy [23]. Previous data has also suggested that the structure of murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N protein changes upon binding viral RNA [25].",

For example, the binding of U1A spliceosomal protein to U1 hairpin II RNA is suggested to be a two step process involving both electrostatic interactions and base stacking to mediate binding [26], which has been proposed to involve a \u2018lure\u2019 and \u2018lock\u2019 step [27]. The HIV-1 NCp7 Gag polyprotein cleavage product can promote strand annealing by inducing electrostatic interactions between strands [28], and the nucleocapsid (NC) protein binds to RNA with high affinity (K\nd\n = 94\u2013315 nM) via electrostatic interactions [29]. Likewise the binding of southern cowpea mosaic virus coat protein R domain to viral is mediated by electrostatic interactions and the R domain changed conformation upon binding RNA [30]. In order to investigate the role of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein and full-length protein in binding viral RNA, SPR and circular dichroism (CD) were used to determine the strength and specificity of RNA/protein interactions, and to investigate whether any structural changes occurred.",

The resulting sensograms (Fig. 3B) show that the addition of 300 mM salt decreased the overall binding affinity of N protein to RNA (11 nM). Although unlike the amino-terminal region there is a large proportion of full length protein retained on the RNA at the end of the dissociation period (Fig. 3B) (dissociation rate 0.012 1/s). This data suggests that interactions are stronger between full length N protein and RNA than those of the amino-terminal region.

Leader RNA alone was analysed by CD at these wavelengths and no adsorption was observed (data not shown). Secondary structure content for each spectra was calculated using DICHROWEB [42] which utilises a series of algorithms to provide calculated secondary structure content and allows direct comparison of calculated structures and experimental data (Table 1\n). This analysis of the real time solution structure of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein suggested a large proportion of \u03b2-sheet, turns and random coils, which is in close agreement with the solid state crystal structure [24]. There was no significant difference in this solution structure of the amino-terminus with and without viral RNA, suggesting that no gross conformational change occurs. In contrast, CD analysis of the binding of the leader RNA to N protein resulted in a conformational change of the protein (Fig. 5\n) indicated by the change in the CD profile between the presence and absence of RNA. For example, DICHROWEB revealed that the percentage of \u03b1-helix changed from 21% to 16% in the presence of leader RNA.

            "text": "Previous equilibrium binding studies have shown that the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein binds to viral RNA [4]. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism and kinetics of this interaction. SPR analysis allowed the monitoring of the formation of complexes in real-time and provided simultaneous equilibrium and kinetic information [43]. The dynamic nature of protein:RNA interactions may be a key feature in the regulation of a number of biological mechanisms. The rate of binding and release may influence processes such as the ordered assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes (encapsidation of viral RNA), movement of RNA:protein complexes between sub-cellular compartments and competition for binding sites. Elucidation of the partial crystal structure of N protein revealed that conserved basic amino acids in this region lie within close proximity to form a positively charged cluster [9], [23], [24]. The resulting data indicated that electrostatic interactions, most likely between this basic cluster and the negative phosphodiester backbone of RNA, play a central role in binding. However, other bonds may important in the stabilisation of N protein with viral RNA.",
