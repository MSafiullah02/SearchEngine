But what should have been excitement in the air was displaced ongoing anxiety over COVID-19. Less than a week after breaking stories of overrun hospitals in Italy, the virus had reached the east coast of the United States and our patients were showing signs of fever and respiratory compromise. As a surgeon, I did not realize, how this might affect my practice, but as the hours ticked by it became clear that surgical practice as we knew it was changing.1\u20133",

Nervous humor was used to build team trust. We all knew we were susceptible to contracting the virus and passing it along to our patients. We knew that patients all around the world were dying, and that nearly 200,000 people had already contracted it. Perhaps more anxiety provoking was what we did not know. Because of the lack of diagnostic testing, we had limited ability to determine who was positive and who was negative. In 2020, when blood tests are simply ordered in the computer, seamlessly collected, magically resulted, and acted upon, our inability to determine who was sick and who was not added perceived distance between patient and diagnosis. We were all proud to be on the unit, but reasonably fearful for the patients, for our healthcare colleagues, and for ourselves.",

The mesh had become infected after about 3 weeks and he had been taken to the OR for a washout, after which he had begun to recover quite nicely. A week later, and otherwise nearing discharge, he had a fever. Then he was placed on oxygen, tachypneic. This all developed in the 24 hours before we rounded on him. He was transferred to the BCT\u2014something I had not yet heard of. This was the biocontainment triage unit. The BCT\u2014it was where the \u201cCOVID rule outs\u201d went.",

There was new, unfamiliar signage everywhere and clipboards hung from makeshift barriers, presumably to document the comings and goings of care providers on the unit. In the first room, I could see 2 astronaut-like intensive care unit (ICU) team members sewing in a newly placed subclavian line. The BCT was sterile, with no smell. It was quiet. Eerily quiet for an ICU. There was no sound because behind the closed glass doors of the patient rooms were additional all-white, plastic barriers separating the patient from the world. Cut into these white plastic barriers were clear plastic windows. One had to awkwardly adjust their neck to see through 2 sets of windows to get a glimpse of the patient.",

In my mind, I gently pressed on it, pronouncing him well and validating his stay. But, this did not happen. In reality, he was fine. His wound looked okay on the monitor. I asked him some questions about his abdomen, pain, and his comfort. We discussed that his oxygen level was improving at that he would soon be well enough to leave the ICU. We laughed a little.
