However, S. aureus can also be pathogenic, causing skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, mastitis, osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome and sepsis. It can harbour numerous virulence-associated genes, many of which reside on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Infections caused by S. aureus can be treated with a variety of antibiotics including flucloxacillin, cefazolin, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, vancomycin, doxycycline amongst others, depending on the clinical presentation, severity and the susceptibility profile of the infecting strain.",

Methicillin resistance is mediated by a modified penicillin binding protein (PBP2\u00b4 or PBP2a) that confers resistance to virtually all beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of some recently developed compounds such as ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. The genes mecA or mecC typically encode this property. The mecA gene is most commonly responsible for methicillin resistance in S. aureus and is localised on a variety of large and complex mobile genetic elements (MGEs), called staphylococcal cassette chromosome elements (SCCmec). The mecC gene is localised on an uncommon SCCmec element (type XI; (1, 2) ) and its presence is largely restricted to Western Europe where a distinct zoonotic connection to wildlife, especially hedgehogs, has been observed (3) (4) (5) .",

Traditionally, this has been achieved using selective growth media containing methicillin or cefoxitin, salt and a chromogenic substrate (for an overview, see (8) ). The latter facilitates the quick differentiation of MRSA from other, clinically less relevant staphylococcal species that may also harbour mec genes. While the use of chromogenic media is relatively inexpensive and convenient, plates must be incubated for 18-24 h before results are obtained. Considering that clinical judgements on whether to isolate a patient or to commence presumptive therapy with antibiotics that covers MRSA commonly require a much quicker decision, a variety of rapid molecular PCR tests has been developed and commercialised (9) . These need to identify the presence of mecA and mecC and/or the presence of SCCmec elements together with a S. aureus-specific genetic marker(s). In addition, molecular tests should remain negative if the mec gene and/or the SCCmec element are present in another staphylococcal species that also might occur in the same sample. This can be achieved by placing one primer for the amplification reaction into the core chromosomal gene adjacent to the SCCmec element (orfX), which is present in all staphylococci, the sequence of which differs between different species. Importantly, the second primer cannot be placed into the mecA or mecC sequence as the distance between orfX and the mec gene is simply too large to be covered by a standard PCR. A \"downstream constant segment\" (dcs) of SCC is widely distributed and highly conserved among MRSA strains, even among strains harbouring different types of SCCmec elements, making it an obvious choice for the placement of a second amplification primer. However, this approach can have drawbacks. Firstly, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus might yield a positive test result if they carry an SCC element without a mec gene, such as a dysfunctional remnant of SCCmec (10) or an element associated with fusidic acid resistance. Secondly, an MRSA strain with a non-dcs downstream sequence might yield a negative result in such a test. In a central European setting, ca. 5% of MRSA strains might carry one of as many as fourteen known different SCC terminal sequences alternate to dcs (11) . In order to ensure the reliability of .

Indeed, it is more likely that the entire variant SCCmec IVa cassette (including the insert) was transferred between the ancestors of the two strains, although the direction of this transfer remains unknown. P11PPP12 also harbours an ACME-II element downstream of SCCmec IVa, which comprises another SCC terminal sequence (as in FR753166.1, pos. 481-568), arc genes, another copy of tnpIS431, and heavy metal resistance genes.

Blood cultures, incubated in an automatedBACTEC system (Becton Dickinson; Heidelberg, Germany/Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) became positive within one day. The organism was identified as S. aureus directly from positive blood culture bottles by peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridisation (PNA FISH, AdvanDx, Woburn, MA, USA). The S. aureus isolate from one blood culture bottle (Graz_511421-19) was investigated by using the GeneXpert MRSA/SA BC PCR assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in order to identify S. aureus/MRSA. Simultaneously, rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (RAST) was performed according to EUCAST guidelines (15, 16). The GeneXpert test was negative for MRSA but RAST revealed cefoxitin resistance after six hours of incubation. Additional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Vitek2, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France) was performed confirming that it was indeed an MRSA isolate. Another molecular MRSA detection assay, BD MAX\u2122 StaphSR assay (Becton Dickinson) was performed; it also yielded a negative result. Microarray-based characterisation with the S. aureus Genotyping Kit 2.0 (Abbott [Alere Technologies GmbH], Jena, Germany; see below) detected mecA, confirming the disk diffusion result for MRSA, and assigned the isolate to CC1-MRSA-IV.",
