            "text": "The SARS outbreak in 2003 stimulated a series of engineering investigations into the airborne infectious diseases transmission mechanisms in the built environment. A few studies attempted to combine epidemiologic investigations with airflow analysis, but the airflow analysis remained to be preliminary [1], [2]. In the investigation of the outbreak in a high-rise residential estate in Hong Kong, the CFD simulation did indicate that the transmission pattern between adjacent high-rise blocks qualitatively agrees with the wind direction. In the related study aiming to reveal the vertical transmission pattern in one building, multi-zone modeling technique was employed, which had inadequacies in modeling airflow through large window openings [3]. Niu and Tung [4] used on-site tracer gas measurement to experimentally investigate the re-entry possibility of exhaust air from the lower floor into the immediate upper floor for high-rise residential buildings with single-sided natural ventilation conditions (Fig. 1\n). It was revealed that the upstairs room may contain 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor, which can help explain the presence of SARS-CoV RNA found on the window sill deposits in the upstairs of an index patient. Gao et al.'s [5] CFD study on the dispersion of one tracer gas agrees with the on-site measurement. With the help of the Wells\u2013Riley infection risk model, Gao et al. [5] estimated the vertical cross-household infection risk in the upper floor using the data of tuberculosis. It was found that a significant infection risk up to 6% for the upstairs residents can be resulted in, when merely assuming an 8 h continuous stay at home.",

            "text": "On the other hand, recent systematic reviews [6], [7] concluded that person to person respiratory virus transmission could occur in three possible modes: airborne transmission, droplet transmission, and direct contact with secretions (or fomites). Currently, by droplets transmission it is meant short-distance (usually less than 1 m) transmission via large droplets (\u2a7e5 \u03bcm diameter) generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking, and by airborne transmission it is meant long-distance transmission via the dissemination of virus-laden droplet nuclei (particles less than 5 \u03bcm that result from the evaporation of large droplets). But whether the three transmission modes are mutually exclusive and which mode is the most significant transmission route for a particular disease are debatable. In general, it is believed that respiratory droplets movements in the room air play a key role for airborne transmitted diseases. Arguably, airborne transmission does not necessarily cause long range infections since a wide range of other confounding factors are also playing important roles, and these include the shedding rate, viability and infectiousness of the pathogen and the wind, temperature and humidity conditions. In general, aerosol dynamics differs from gaseous pollutants due to the effects of gravity, inertia and deposition at solid surfaces. Therefore, as a companion paper of Gao et al. [5], which studied the airflow and gaseous pollutants between vertically adjacent floors, this study simulates the transport possibilities of droplet residuals by using both Lagrangian and Eulerian methods. The aim is to explore whether the virus-laden aerosols could be carried upward by inter-flat airflows between floors in high-rise residential buildings when the gravity and surface deposition effects are considered.",

The convection terms are discretized by second order upwind scheme and the diffusion term by central difference also with second-order accuracy. The variables at the near-wall cells and the corresponding quantities on the wall are bridged by the standard logarithmic law wall function. The turbulent effect is modeled by the RNG k\u2013\u03b5 model [9]. Although large eddy simulation (LES) has been adopted to investigate wind field and indoor\u2013outdoor airflows due to its capacity of handling the unsteadiness and intermittency of the flow as well as providing detailed information on the turbulence structure, the RANS models are extensively used in industrial and engineering practice because they generally use about one order of magnitude less CPU time than LES while keeping an acceptable accuracy.",

If particle loadings are even higher than 10\u22123, particle\u2013particle interaction becomes important [10]. Since indoor particulate levels normally vary from several to hundreds of \u03bcg/m3 (about 105\u2013107\n particles/m3) the two-phase flow can be deemed as dilute systems and one-way coupling is rational. A single-phase turbulence model can be used to represent the mixture.",

            "text": "In both numerical approaches, all particles are assumed to be spherical. Particle coagulation, reflection at walls, re-suspension, and phase-change such as evaporation, which may actually occur in indoor environments, are ignored. According to Hinds [11], coagulation rate is proportional to the square of the number concentration. Supposing a diameter of 1.0 \u03bcm and a concentration of 107 particles per m3, 1% decrement of particle number concentration needs about 500 days. This time scale is much larger than the indoor airflow time scale in that the indoor air can be renewed several times per hour. Particles\u2019 bounce back from a solid surface is influenced by particle size, surface material, orientation, initial momentum and even electrostatic forces. Fine particles have a strong probability to stick on the solid surfaces, especially on those made of synthetic fibers [12]. Morawska [13] demonstrated that pure water droplets may completely evaporate within 0.003 and 0.3 s for 1 and 10 \u03bcm droplets respectively, at a condition of 80% relative humidity (RH). These periods are much shorter than their settling time, the indoor airflow time scale, and even shorter than the sneezing and coughing processes (around 0.5 s). Nicas et al. [14] suggested that evaporation from respiratory particles with an initial diameter less than 20 \u03bcm be treated as an instantaneous process. The droplets produced from sneezing and coughing could have a significant amount of pathogens-carrying residues. The equilibrium diameter of the desiccated particles is generally estimated to be around one-half of its initial diameter [14]. Small pathogens-carrying particles (diameter less than 10 \u03bcm) can reach the alveolar region with a different efficiency, posing an infection risk for a susceptible person [11]. Based on this information, in this study we simulated the movements of particles with diameter of 1, 10, and 20 \u03bcm.",

The third term in Eq. (1) represents the additional forces exerted on the particles. In the current study, Brownian force, and Saffman's Lift force are taken into account in that they may be significant for fine particles. Thermophoretic force is included as well to reflect the non-isothermal condition. As the density ratio between particles and air is in the order of O(103), other forces, such as Basset force, pressure gradient force, virtual mass force, are neglected because their fraction in F\u21d2addi is infinitesimal [17]. Detailed descriptions of these forces are available in the Fluent manual [8]. The effect of turbulence on particle dispersion is modeled by using a stochastic method, i.e. the discrete random walk (DRW) model to simulate the fluctuating velocity. Stochastic realizations of turbulence have been successfully applied in many works [18], [19]. The DRW model assumes turbulence is isotropic and the random velocity fluctuations follow a Gaussian probability distribution:(2)ui\u2032=\u03c2iu\u2032i2\u00af=\u03c2i2k3.\n",

In the boundary layer, velocity fluctuations in the direction normal to the wall are substantially smaller than in the spanwise and streamwise directions. Thus, isotropic decomposition of kinetic energy over-predicts the deposition rate of small particles [20], [21]. In this scenario, Reynolds stress model or LES are much more preferable [22]. If the flow field is simulated in the framework of two-equation models, to settle this problem Wang and James [23] developed the following equations to modify the turbulent kinetic energy for the first cells close to the wall:(6)uy\u2032=\u03c2y2k3\u00d7fv,\n(7)fv=1-exp(-0.02y+).With the help of Eqs.

Its improvement on the prediction of deposition rate will be examined in the validation section.",

The ratio of particle concentration in the upper floor to that in the lower floor decreases. In case of 4.0 m/s, the ratio is 0.3% for 20.0 \u03bcm particles. It implies that in the design of ventilation and air distribution systems, the indoor air speed level is essential to determine the suspension of particles in the room air. Air at higher speeds could entrain larger particles, and even makes deposited particles re-suspended. Although, according to the deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff [25], high friction velocity in the boundary layer will also increase the deposition velocity, this effect is negligible for particles larger than 2.5 \u03bcm because deposition onto the upward facing surfaces caused by gravitational force constitutes most of the overall deposition.",

In spite of the different definitions of the \u201cratio\u201d in the two approaches, excluding the factor that some particles may enter into the upper floor and then move out of the same floor through the window, the particulate mass in the upper floor predicted by the DRW model is still lower than that by the drift-flux model. Fig. 8 shows that the discrepancy becomes large for fine particles, and small for coarse particles. For a close view of the results from the DRW model, Table 2\ngives the numbers of deposited particles in both flats. Even for 1.0 \u03bcm particles, more than 70% of the particles have been predicted to be absorbed by the inner surfaces of the lower flat. This result is obviously irrational. Therefore in current settings, the application of the DRW model may falsely give us an overoptimistic result with regard to the upward transport of viruses by natural ventilation airflows. In the best case when wind velocity is 4.0 m/s, three out of 8000 particles of 20.0 \u03bcm can get into the upper floor. In terms of infection risk, this may still be indicative, given that one infected person may sneeze several times and one sneeze produces more than one million particles [37].",

This over-prediction is more substantial for fine particles. Modification of the near-wall kinetic energy may alleviate this problem. However, sometimes the modification could lead to unreasonable spatial distributions of particles.\u2022Both simulation approaches revealed that the cascade effect exists for particulate pollutants. The particle concentration in the upper floor is two to three orders of magnitude lower than that in the lower floor, depending on the particle sizes. 1.0 \u03bcm particles disperse like gases. Strong deposition at solid surfaces and gravitational settling of particles larger than 20.0 \u03bcm greatly limit the upward transport of them.\u2022Current simulation deals with single-sided natural ventilation where buoyancy is the major driving force. The effect of wind is more complicated. A high wind velocity could suppress the buoyancy force, and limit the dispersion of particles between flats.\n",
