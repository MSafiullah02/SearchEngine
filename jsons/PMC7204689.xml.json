            "text": "The death of a loved one is considered the most powerful stressor in everyday life with bereaved individuals at increased risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes (1,2). How a person copes after the death of a significant loved one is influenced by personality and coping style, the relationship with the deceased, and the circumstances of the death (3). While the majority of bereaved individuals adjust to their loss without requiring professional intervention (4), public health models estimate that approximately 10% of bereaved individuals are at \u2018high risk\u2019 of developing complex grief reactions possibly requiring intervention from a mental health professional, and an additional 30% are considered at \u2018moderate risk\u2019 and might benefit from group support (5). Risk factors for poor bereavement outcomes include a history of past psychiatric issues, lack of social support, a sudden or traumatic death, lack of preparation for the death, a hospital\u2013based death, and a death in the ICU (2,6, 7, 8). Following a death in the ICU, specific risk factors for complicated grief reactions, such as prolonged grief disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, include the patient dying while intubated, family members not able to say goodbye, and poor communication between physicians and the patient\u2019s family (9). Clearly, some of these risk factors are heightened for any death during this pandemic, whether the death was a direct result of COVID-19 or not. Patients with COVID-19, however, can have a clinical course that increases these risks, including a precipitous decline and death or, conversely, a prolonged ICU stay.",

Similarly, in a bereavement study conducted at our cancer institute (15), bereaved family members were asked what they wished the clinical team could have done prior to their loved one\u2019s death that would have helped them in dealing with their loss. The most common themes identified included providing more accurate information about prognosis, the end-of-life period and the dying process, earlier referral to hospice and more caregiver support prior to the patient\u2019s death. Conversely, when asked what helped them in dealing with their loss, the family members reported compassionate care by the team, including communication that conveyed empathy, caring and concern for both the patient and caregiver. Bereavement outreach from the providers and the offering of condolences were also found to be helpful.",

Helping people learn to evaluate their thinking and generate more realistic or accurate thinking patterns improves both their emotional state and their behavior (20). The cognitive model provides a framework for identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts or beliefs that might result in feelings of guilt, anger or blame (21). For example, during the pandemic, a family member might blame themselves or others for their loved one\u2019s death or feel extreme guilt about not being present when their loved one died.
