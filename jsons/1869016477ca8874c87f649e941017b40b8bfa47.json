Infections are an important cause of serious morbidity and pose substantial threats to life. Thus, the challenges of infection facing the transplant clinician are both myriad and dynamic. Early after transplant, neutropenic infections are most important. Later herpesvirus and invasive fungal infections predominate. Even late after transplant, patients with chronic graft versus host disease remain susceptible to encapsulated bacterial, varicella zoster virus, and invasive fungal infections. Over time, with robust engraftment and control of GVHD, the risk of serious infections recedes with immune reconstitution.",

            "text": "Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is variously known as bone marrow transplant, stem cell transplant, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It is used to treat conditions that result in bone marrow failure (such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes), immunodeficiencies (such as severe combined immunodeficiency or chronic granulomatous disease), or congenital disorders that result in enzyme deficiencies in cells derived from hematopoietic precursors that result in metabolic disorders (such as mucopolysaccharidoses or glycogen storage diseases). These disorders are relatively rare in the general population. More commonly, HCT is used as a cancer therapy, primarily for hematologic malignancies (such as lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma). In this latter type of application, HCT is used to facilitate administration of intensive chemoradiotherapy. The intensive conditioning regimen suppresses and sometimes ablates the normal hematopoietic precursors. The graft is given to rescue the hematopoietic injury. In the case of allogeneic HCT, the graft also provides adoptive immunotherapy targeting cancer cells that express novel antigens.",

Allogeneic HCT necessitates stringent HLA matching to optimize engraftment and minimize the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD). Immunosuppressive therapy is typically given posttransplant for 4-6 months and then tapered gradually and finally stopped after approximately 6 months. The occurrence of GVHD may necessitate a more prolonged course of immunotherapy and slow immune recovery. Immunodeficiency is more prolonged after allogeneic HCT (typically a year, sometimes longer) than after autologous transplant and the risk of infection is greater.",

Potent immunosuppressive agents are used in the place of intensive chemoradiotherapy. Such regimens produce less acute toxicity sparing mucosal injury. In addition, myelosuppression is less and times to engraftment are typically shorter. With reduced intensity transplants, there is less susceptibility for neutropenia-associated bacterial and fungal infections. However, there still are substantial risks for later viral and fungal infections typically seen with GVHD and immunosuppressive therapy. The graft used in HCT consists of a mixture of hematopoietic stem cells, more differentiated hematopoietic precursors, and mature immune cells. The grafts differ in several respects: peripheral blood grafts typically have higher numbers of hematopoietic precursors and also more lymphoid cells. Peripheral blood grafts are associated with faster neutrophil engraftment and more chronic GVHD. Cord blood grafts have fewer hematopoietic precursors and the lymphoid cells are more na\u00efve immunophenotypically and functionally. Such cord blood grafts are associated with slower neutrophil recovery and less GVHD.",

Tunneled central venous catheters are routinely used and these foreign bodies breach the integument, allowing invasion by skin colo nizing organisms. The types of infectious syndromes commonly seen during the early phase are neutropenic infections due to enteric bacteria and Candida (discussed in more detail elsewhere), catheter-related infections, primarily due to skin colonizing bacteria, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis or less commonly Staphylococcus aureus, and organisms that colonize the oral mucosa, such as alpha streptococci.

Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), Aspergillus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can occur during this period. The risk for serious infection is greater after allogeneic HCT since GVHD or the use of high dose corticosteroids can intensify T cell immunodeficiency [1] [2] [3] [4] . The use of anti-thymocyte globulin (or alemtuzumab) to prevent or treat GVHD or promote engraftment can have enduring effects on T cells (and NK cells in the case of alemtuzumab) and may render the patient vulnerable for a longer period of time. T cell depletion of the graft and HLA disparity between the donor and recipient delay T cell recovery. With nonablative transplants, the immunosuppressive regimen is frequently tapered more quickly (to provoke a graft-versus-tumor effect); this may increase the risk for GVHD. Various single center reports have suggested either an increase or decrease in infectious risk with nonablative transplants; as yet, the difference in conditioning regimens, case mix, and immunosuppressive regimens prevent a clear understanding of whether the risk of infection or timing of infection and epidemiology of infection is truly similar or different. Further study is needed.",

Patients who develop chronic GVHD require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and are susceptible to fungal and viral infections due to T cell immunodeficiency. The need for prednisone at daily doses of 1 mg/kg/day for extended periods of time has been associated with a particularly high risk for aspergillosis. The use of infliximab renders the patient at even higher risk for aspergillosis.

Cord blood transplants often have longer durations of neutropenia that may extend up to 28-35 days. Neutropenic fever is common in the pre-engraftment period but is less problematic in nonablative transplants. Fever may be generally the only manifestation of infection and, operationally, infection should be approached as the likely cause since serious morbidity may ensue if untreated. Evaluation should include elicitation of symptoms suggestive of an infectious site and examination to look for an infectious site (especially skin, oral mucosa, lungs, catheter site, abdomen, and perianal area). Blood cultures should be obtained and cultures of any site suspected to be infected. A chest radiograph is generally done, but if the lungs are highly suspected from history or examination, then a CT scan is preferred since it would be more likely to yield useful information [6] . Persistent or recrudescent fever may be due to antibiotic-resistant Gram negative bacteria, Gram positive bacteria (especially S. epidermidis, less commonly an alpha streptococcus, or S. aureus), or fungus (especially Candida or Aspergillus). Evaluation and more specific diagnostic considerations for infections in the neutropenic host are addressed in Chap. 5 and have been delineated in consensus guidelines [7, 8] .",

Elicitation of lower tract symptoms and evidence of consolidation on physical exam should alert the clinician to the possibility of pneumonia. However, even in the absence of any of these, fever of uncertain etiology may warrant investigation of pneumonia as the source of fever. Hemoptysis may occur with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage early after transplant. Hemoptysis, pleuritic pain, and the presence of pleural rub may suggest Aspergillosis. Upper respiratory tract symptoms suggest a respiratory viral infection. Lack of sputum is typical of respiratory virus, CMV, and PCP pneumonias. However, these manifestations are too insensitive and not sufficiently specific to indicate firmly the etiology. CT scans to determine the character of infiltrate is more useful. Prior to the onset of pneumonia symptoms, a number of tests may identify those at risk for or with incipient lower respiratory tract infection. Nasal viral cultures, shell vial centrifugation cultures using RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies, or rapid diagnostics using DFA or ELISA assays are important for diagnostic assessment of the respiratory viruses, and may be useful in the assessment of patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. CMV antigen assays or PCR assays of blood samples should be performed and often are positive 1-2 weeks in advance of CMV pneumonia. Serum galactomannan can be useful as an adjunct in the diagnosis of Aspergillus pneumonia [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

Once the evaluation is complete, elimination of the presumptive therapies no longer justified is appropriate. In the case of a suspected mold infection, even with an extensive negative evaluation, continued therapy may be justified if the clinical suspicion remains high. If the etiology is not clear and the patient does not improve clinically and radiographically, further investigation should be undertaken. Typically, infiltrates may get worse early even in the face of clinical improvement and even though pneumonia ultimately responds. It generally requires 2 weeks at a minimum to see radiographic improvement.

However, they are widely used in the pre-engraftment phase, and more recent studies suggest such benefits as reductions in febrile episodes, bacterial infections, and death (from any cause) in patients with neutropenia. Such benefits have been seen in patients with acute leukemia and HCT [61] [62] [63] . Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are the most suitable agents. Drawbacks include cost, toxicities, and the risk of antibiotic resistance. If antibiotic prophylaxis is elected, surveillance of isolates for resistance is important since various centers have reported the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance [64] . Although most infections that are prevented are from gram-negative bacteria, there seems to also be some protection against alpha streptococcal and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infections as well [61] . Another concern is an increased susceptibility for C. difficile infection. Accordingly, centers that choose to use fluoroquinolone prophylaxis must monitor both resistance as well as C. difficile infection rates. The issues concerning antibiotic prophylaxis are discussed in greater detail in Chap. 10 .",

Two studies of itraconazole prophylaxis in the allogeneic HCT setting suggest a potential for benefit to prevent IA [78, 79] , but limitations include poor tolerability and concerns about toxicity. Posaconazole has been evaluated in HCT patients with acute and chronic GVHD and compared to fluconazole [80] . This \"targeted\" approach seems sensible since GVHD and its therapy are the major risk factors for IA. Although there was a decrease in breakthrough IA, there was no improvement in clinical success (defined as survival without IFI or use of systemic antifungal therapy). Voriconazole prophylaxis has also been studied in standardrisk allogeneic BMT patients in a randomized double-blind multicenter trial and is not found to be superior to fluconazole in terms of survival at 6 months free of invasive fungal infection although there were fewer IA infections and voriconazole was not associated with greater toxicity [81] . One potential concern with voriconazole is its lack of activity against Zygomycetes; its routine use has been associated with an apparent increase in zygomycosis in several single center studies [18, [82] [83] [84] . However, there were no increases in IA rates in the prospective randomized prophylaxis trial [81] .",

Unfortunately, ganciclovir is associated with myelosuppression. This toxicity has led to evaluation of serial monitoring of HCT patients with weekly testing of blood by the pp65 antigen or PCR assay, and institution of pre-emptive antiCMV therapy with ganciclovir (or foscarnet) in patients who become viremic [87, 90] . In general, there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Prophylaxis is generally associated with fewer episodes of breakthrough CMV pneumonia, but more toxicity. Pre-emptive therapy is associated with more episodes of late-onset CMV pneumonia. Oral valganciclovir has good bioavailability and has been used in limited studies to replace intravenous ganciclovir.
