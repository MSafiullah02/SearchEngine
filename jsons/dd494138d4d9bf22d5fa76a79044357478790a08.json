            "text": "A typical drug discovery cycle (from lead identification through clinical trials) takes around 14 years, with a cost of US$800 million, which makes it costly and tedious (Lavecchia and Di Giovanni 2013) . Because of progress in frontline advancement, busy lifestyle, and less nutritious and unbalanced eating regimens nowadays, new generation is going up against various critical restorative issues for the duration of life. The pharmaceutical industries are fabricating high-volume and low-value/lowvolume and high-value manufactured drugs with a specific end goal to have positive or safe reaction to the body. In any case, as of late, these medications are regarded in a specific way for their indications or warnings, higher costs, nonspecificity, and other real issues like antagonism. Drug hinderance or blocking is an important issue, which may lead to death in a person. In this way, people are choosing traditional methods with a particular ultimate objective to beat these issues. Throughout Indian history, individuals have had confidence in Ayurveda, and at present Ayurveda is drawing world's attention towards itself because it offers important restorative properties and fewer symptoms. India is a biodiverse nation, rich in restorative plants (totaling some 45,000 species-almost 7% of the world's flowering plants) (Ali and Choudhary 2011) . All parts of a plant contain bioactive compounds, which have positive physiological activity in the human body. Numerous phytochemicals are frequently gathered in the external layer of different plant tissues. These bioactive compounds are otherwise called phytoconstituents/phytochemicals/secondary metabolites, which are not supplements but assume a huge part in the plant's protective components (Doughari 2012) . They are considered to have increased supplement value to be used more gainfully by the body. A celebrated expression-\"Prevention is better than cure\"-is conceivable because of the vicinity of bioactive compounds in plants. These give shade, enhance the smell of the plants, and have advantageous effects in the body, such as elimination of free radicals (Zhang et al. 2015) . Some beneficial roles of phytochemicals (which make them unique) are low toxicity, greater affordability, easy availability, biological and therapeutic properties, and raw material enabling extraction of semisynthetic chemical compounds for use in cosmetics, perfumes, etc. (Dillard and German 2000) . The process of computer-aided drug design is shown in Fig. 7 .1. ",

LBVS techniques involve pharmacophore and three-dimensional (3D) shape matching, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), and likeness and substructure searches. A standout among the most well known ligand-based drug design approaches is QSAR. The objective of QSAR is to determine the connection between the basic/physicochemical properties of active compounds and their biological activity. The use of virtual screening for hit and lead identification involves a group of procedures based upon the data that have already been collected regarding the targeted and/or existing ligand earlier in the screening process. Machine learning is rapidly becoming popular in LBVS as novel calculations are proposed to manufacture precise and strong QSARs. Diverse techniques are proposed, and every technique has its own points of interest and detriments. Among these strategies, regression and classification methods-for example, multiple linear regression (MLR), nearest neighbor, na\u00efve Bayesian classification, support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees-are effectively connected. Discovery of novel lead compounds through computational use of experimentally determined protein structures, obtained from screening of databases through focused design exercises, is well established (Jain 2004) .",

A QSARbased approach is an established chemoinformatic technique for predicting and classifying biological activities of untested chemicals (Dudek et al. 2006) . It is based on the general principles of medicinal science that the biological activity of a ligand or compound is identified with its molecular structure or properties, and that structurally similar molecules may have similar biological activities (Tong et al. 1998) . QSAR models can be utilized as a part of outlining new chemical entities (NCEs) and are presently viewed as basic tools in pharmaceutical enterprises to recognize promising hits and create good-quality leads in the initial phase of drug discovery (Myint and Xie 2010) . QSARs depend on the presumption that the structure of a particle (i.e., its geometric, steric, and electronic properties) must contain the aspects that govern its physical, chemical, and organic properties, and on the capacity to represent the chemical by at least one numerical descriptor (Gramatica 2008) . QSARs occur within a congeneric arrangement of compounds, affinities of ligands for their binding sites, rate constants, inhibition constants, and other biological activities either with certain structural features (Free Wilson analysis) or with atomic, group, or molecular properties-for example, lipophilicity, polarizability, electronic properties, and steric properties (Hansch analysis) (Kubinyi 1997; Mannhold et al. 2008 ). Together, structure-activity relationships and QSARs are referred to as (Q)SARs and fall within a scope of strategies known as in silico approaches. A (Q)SAR includes three sections: the (activity) information to be demonstrated and subsequently anticipated, information with which to show it, and a technique to figure out the model. The reasons for in silico studies are as follows (Sethi 2012): 1. To predict biological action and physicochemical properties by rational means 2. To understand and justify the mechanism of action in a series of chemicals QSAR equations have been utilized to depict a huge number of biological activities in various series of drugs and drug ligands. Predominantly, information on enzyme inhibition is connected with the physicochemical properties of the ligands. QSAR studies can reduce the likelihood of costly failures of drug ligand research in preliminary clinical studies by separating the combinatorial libraries (i.e. seperating the collection of chemical compounds, small molecules or macromolecules like proteins which are synthesized by combinational chemistry) (Mannhold et al. 2008) .",

For a medication to have the capacity to achieve its planned clinical impact, it must first have the capacity to reach its target site of activity in the body, at an effective concentration. In the event that the medication is be applied to an outer surface (e.g., skin, ears, or eyes), it may be applied directly to the relevant surface. However, if the medication is intended to create an impact inside the body-regardless of whether it is intended to be systemic (e.g., basic antimicrobials) or aimed at particular tissues (e.g., thyroid medication)the medication must be formulated such that it can reach the circulation and be transported to the intended site(s) of its action. Medications can be delivered in various different ways. These can be mainly divided into enteral routes (e.g., sublingual, oral, and rectal); parenteral routes (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous); inhalations; and topical, transdermal, and intranasal applications. Certain unusual routes may be utilized to yield more effective results, such as intra-arterial chemotherapy administration for malignancies and intrathecal administration for focal sensory system contamination or for spinal anesthesia. These routes are significantly more perilous and clearly require more skill and care for administration of medication. There is an emerging demand for controlled release of drugs to enhance their efficacy. In this regard, the main focus of nanotechnology is on targeted and controlled-release systems for drug delivery, as summarized in Table 7 .3.",

Key properties of any nanomaterial utilized as a part of drug delivery are its biocompatibility and biodegradability, with an aim that the emptied transporter degrades or is transformed into nontoxic substances and eliminated from the body. The objectives of a nanoscale tranquilizer delivery system are as follows: Controlled drug delivery A targeted drug delivery system is intended to specifically transport medications to target tissues, organs, and cells through use of an assortment of drug transporters Controlled delivery of medications improved the drug delivery approaches Tiwari et al. (2012) It is generally intended to enhance the pharmacological and remedial properties of traditional medications and to overcome problems such as limited solubility, drug aggregation, poor biodispersion, and absence of selectivity, controlling the drug delivery carrier and lessening associated tissue injury Controlled delivery controls the site and the rate of medication release Tiwari et al. (2012) It can be intended to limit drug degradation, increment bioavailability, permit targeting of particular cells, and diminish the total amount of medication required; it can also control the delivery of medication to minimize lethality and unsafe reactions Conventional dosing regimens cause fluctuations in plasma drug concentrations; these changes depend upon what happens to the medication inside the body, such as its retention, dispersion, digestion, and discharge; controlled release eliminates such fluctuations in plasma drug concentrations Tiwari (2016); Allen and Cullis (2004) Targeted medications initially are mostly utilized as a part of disease treatment; optimization of the adequacy of a medication is of prime significance in the choice of a delivery system A controlled drug delivery system enhances patient compliance, particularly in long-term treatment for persistent infections Zhan et al.

(2013) This improves the efficacy of the medication while reducing its side effects This reduces drug doses and dosing frequencies Tiwari (2016) Drug targeting is the delivery of drugs to receptors or organs or any other specific part of the body to which one wishes to deliver the drug exclusively Controlled drug delivery occurs when a polymer is combined with a drug or active agent such that the release from the bulk material is (i) Targeting, to ensure that drug concentrations are highest at the intended site of action, with lower drug concentrations and fewer adverse effects in healthy tissues (ii) Improved solubility, to optimize parenteral drug efficacy (iii) Controlled release of drug to the target site enhace the efficacy of drug with prolonged curative activity (iv) Sustained release of drug also extended the half life of the drug (v) Drug movement through the blood-brain barrier and blood-cochlear barrier (Malam et al. 2009 ) (vi) A delivery system that enhances patient compliance, particularly with longterm medication (vii) An appropriate delivery system for drugs that have a short organic half-life",

Gold, platinum, silver, and palladium nanoparticles 20 nm in size have characteristic colors of wine red, yellow, grey-black and dark black, respectively (Khan et al. 2017) . Copper nanoparticles have special properties, which have made them important for various applications such as antimicrobials, catalysts, biosensors, nanoscale drugs, drug delivery, and targeted drug delivery systems (Cerda et al. 2017; Rajesh et al. 2018) .

Nanoparticles can be synthesized to include various types of chemical reducing agents, plant extracts, or enzymes (Cerda et al. 2017; Prasad 2014) . These are effective agents with low toxicity, which is especially important in the biomedical field (Rajesh et al. 2018) . For synthesis of nanoparticles, a number of reducing agents are used, such as ascorbic acid, lithium aluminum hydride, and sodium borohydride (Cerda et al. 2017; Wu and Chen 2004; Tang et al. 2010) . Reducing agents reduce metal ions, followed by agglomeration into clusters. These clusters eventually form metallic colloidal particles (Hussein 2016) . Some nanoparticles have excellent physical and chemical properties but do not possess suitable surface properties for specific applications. Apart from the cost effectiveness of copper nanoparticles, the stability of these nanoparticles is matter of concern; therefore, it may be necessary to modify the surface of the metals (Ruckenstein and Li 2005) . A common method used for surface modification of these nanoparticles is addition of suitable organic groups to the positively charged surface atoms of the metal (Kickelbick and Schubert 2003) .",

For example, metal particles can be made water soluble when suitable groups are attached. A third reason for modifying nanoparticles is to enable their self-organization (Neouze and Schubert 2008; Kickelbick and Schubert 2003; Doty et al. 2005) . Metal nanoparticles can be synthesized by various methods such as metal vapor synthesis, photolytic reduction, radiolytic reduction, the sonochemical method, solvent extraction reduction, the microemulsion technique, the polyol process, and alcohol reduction (Cerda et al. 2017) . Physical and chemical methods are most Anderson and Shive (1997) ; Tang et al. (2012) widely used for synthesis of different nanoparticles. However, the physical methods are very expensive, while the chemical methods are detrimental to the environment, as well as to living organisms (Shamaila et al. 2016) . Moreover, these methods require expensive instruments, high energy, release of harmful chemicals, cell culture, and wasteful purification. The chemical reduction method has some advantages; for example, it is simple and inexpensive, and it is easy to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles. However, it has some disadvantages that can harm the environment, such as the need for disposal of noxious solvents and dangerous chemical reducing agents (Cerda et al. 2017) . Various nanosystems used in drug delivery, with their unique characteristics and their applications, are listed in Table 7 .5.",

In green nanosynthesis of metal nanoparticles, use of (1) nontoxic chemicals used as reducing agents, (2) environmentally friendly solvents, and (3) renewable materials as stabilizing or passivating agents is very important to consider (Mohan et al. 2014; Prasad et al. 2018) . Synthesis of nanoparticles using plant and plant-based biopolymers can be considered green chemistry. Plant extracts are used for metal ion reduction to form nanoparticles. Plant metabolites-such as sugars, starches, proteins, polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic acids, gums, and \u03b2-cyclodextrin-play important roles in metal ion reduction into nanoparticles and their stability (Parveen and Rao 2015) . In recent decades, some well known examples of carbohydrate polymers, such as chitosan, have been employed for synthesis of metal nanoparticles because of their interactions with metal ions and metal nanoparticles. With the increasing demand for adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly protocols, the use of biodegradable and nonbiodegradable precursors to prepare nanomaterials has been extensively explored. For instance, within the polysaccharide group, cyclodextrins have been applied as stabilizing agents to produce copper nanoparticles (Manivannan and Ramaraj 2012) . \u03b2-Cyclodextrin is a nonreducing cyclic oligosaccharide with seven units of \u03b1-D-glucose. The glucose rings are connected through \u03b1-(1-4) linkage with a hydrophilic outer surface and a hydrophobic interior cavity (Navgire et al. 2016) . \u03b2-Cyclodextrin can form inclusion complexes with various organic compounds (Gogoi and Sarma Chandra 2017) and act as stabilizing agent because particles synthesized with it have the smallest size distribution. This is due to the stiff structure and low water solubility of \u03b2-cyclodextrin, causing complex precipitation easily and thereby regulating the growth of the nanoparticles (Cerda et al. 2017 ).",

Applications of this old system are being rediscovered and could be of immense potential in yielding innovative metal-herb formulations that could hold promise for use in biomedicine (Galib et al. 2011) . For developing such preparations, the biocompatibility and therapeutic activity of phytoconstituents present in plants play a determining role in the choice of various herbs. Such herbomineral preparations could have better curative potential because of their physiological compatibility, minimal toxicity, natural origin, easy accessibility, and lower costs. The promising applications of such nanomaterial-based herbal preparations in the field of biomedicine have led to the innovative concept of herbonanoceuticals (Gomes et al. 2014) . Many studies have shown that during the processing of Ayurvedic metal-based formulations, the size of the metal particles goes down to the nanometric range (Pavani et al. 2013) . Gold is used as swarna bhasma (gold ash) in different conventional Indian Ayurvedic preparations and has been characterized as having a particle size of 56-57 nm and a spherical shape. Mercury-based Ayurvedic preparations include crystalline mercuric sulfide in a 25-to 50-nm size range (Pal et al. 2014) . Pavani et al. (2013) reported a modified method of bhasmikaran (a method for preparing bhasma) for preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles, which was based on green synthesis. XRD and TEM analyses have demonstrated that during use of the Ayurvedic bhasmikaran method, metal nanoparticles are formed. The metal nanoparticles, along with various phytoconstituents, can lead to better absorption and even tissue-specific targeting of therapeutic ingredients in the body. Because of their small size, these preparations are said to be more effective, as naturally synthesized metal nanoparticles do not cause toxicity in the body (Paul and Chugh 2011) .",

Polyphenols are the main phytoconstituents in plant extracts that possess the ability to act as reducing agents, mainly because of their hydroxyl side chains. These can act as capping and stabilizing agents for metal nanoparticle formation. Gold nanoparticles are among the most widely utilized metal nanoparticles in the biomedical field because of their biocompatibility (Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2008) . Geetha et al. (2013) reported a rapid, economical, and single-step method for formation of gold nanoparticles, utilizing a flower extract from Couroupita guianensis. Green synthesis of gold nanoparticles was reported using glucoxylans of Mimosa pudica seeds to which no extra chemical stabilizing agent was added (Iram et al. 2014) . Rao et al. (2016) discussed different medicinal plants and their active compounds, as well as green-synthesized metallic nanoparticles from medicinal plants, in relation to their anticancer activities. Metal nanoparticles formed using plant extracts showed enhanced tumor specificity, promising activity, and reduced toxic effects on healthy cells. The cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles are predominantly due to their large surface area, which enables efficient drug delivery, and some nanoparticles exhibit anticancer activity.

However, there are certain problems with metal nanoparticles, which need to be addressed prior to their commercial usage. The metal nanoparticles used for various purposes are reported to have diverse characteristics and diverse derivations, and are being utilized in various systems. However, their potential side effects in patients and the environment are yet to be thoroughly explored (Krug and Wick 2011) . Contradictory biosafety considerations pertaining to metal nanoparticles have been reported in different studies (Tsoi et al. 2012; Edmundson et al. 2014; Ambwani et al. 2015) .",

Over the years, studies have provided details regarding the capability of nanocarriers, utilizing diverse plans to deliver anticancer therapeutic agents that are created artificially or originate from natural sources. This chapter has focused on the collaboration of nanotechnology in progressing the bioavailability of promising phytochemicals, which may encounter delivery issues in their free-drug form. It has also shown that different natural products may yield compounds that are ideal for use in different nanoformulation systems. In any case, progress in nanomedicine-regardless of whether it is phytochemical based or synthetic based-fits to the clinical setting is advancing more slowly than expected, fundamentally because of safety issues and, in particular, the cost effectiveness of nanomedicines when the costs of manufacturing and therapeutic application are taken into consideration. In the event that these issues can be settled, phytochemical-based nanomedicines (herbonanoceuticals) may end up being favored choices for various therapeutic treatments in the future.",
