We sought to develop a risk score for progression to LRTI from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in HCT recipients. Risk factors for LRTI within 90 days were analyzed using Cox regression among HCT recipients with rhinovirus URTI between January 2009 and March 2016. The final multivariable model included factors with a meaningful effect on the bootstrapped optimism corrected concordance statistic. Weighted score contributions based on hazard ratios were determined. Cumulative incidence curves estimated the probability of LRTI at various score cut-offs. Of 588 rhinovirus URTI events, 100 (17%) progressed to LRTI. In a final multivariable model allogeneic grafts, prior rhinovirus URTI, low lymphocyte count, low albumin, positive cytomegalovirus serostatus, recipient statin use, and steroid use 2 mg/kg/day were associated with progression to LRTI. A weighted risk score cut-off with the highest sensitivity and specificity was determined. Risk scores above this cut-off were associated with progression to LRTI (cumulative incidence 28% versus 11% below cut-off; P < .001).

First, this is a retrospective study in which data collection, including viral load determination, was dependent on clinical databases.

At our institution the use of BAL is based on standardized protocols outlining that BAL should be performed in HCT recipients with a respiratory virus detected in the upper respiratory tract and abnormal chest imaging. However, ultimately the need for BAL is determined by the attending physician, and thus some proven or probable cases (HRV detected in the lower respiratory tract without abnormal imaging) may have been missed. By including both proven and possible LRTI events (no probable events occurred), this effect is mitigated; however, proven LRTI may be the more relevant outcome given the mortality rates seen with proven HRV LRTI and the differences in outcomes observed in proven LRTI for PIV and RSV [3, 36, 37] . Regardless, many institutions do not routinely use BAL for virologic confirmation, and thus our results for any LRTI events can be broadly applicable.
