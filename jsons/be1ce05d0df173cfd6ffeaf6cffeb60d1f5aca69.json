A recent problem in this field is the learning of low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds under L0-norm constraints for error terms. Despite significant efforts, no method that consistently treats such features exists. We propose a novel unsupervised outlier detection method, L0-norm Constrained Autoencoders (L0-AE), based on an autoencoder-based detector with L0-norm constraints for error terms. Unlike existing methods, the proposed optimization procedure of L0-AE provably guarantees the convergence of the objective function under a mild condition, while neither the relaxation of the L0-norm constraint nor the linearity of the latent manifold is enforced. Experimental results show that the proposed L0-AE is more robust and accurate than other reconstruction-based methods, as well as conventional methods such as Isolation Forest.",

Reconstruction-based methods, such as Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), are popular approaches for unsupervised outlier detection [5, 12] . A recent trend is the use of nonlinear models, particularly neural network models [1, 20, 24] . For example, the Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA) [24] learns a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold where normal samples are located using an autoencoder (AE) [10] . These reconstruction-based methods assume that the feature vector of each sample may include outlier elements; therefore, it is necessary to learn low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds to avoid the impact of outliers.",

To avoid such difficulty, relaxation methods, i.e., the use of the l 1 -norm or other convex regularization terms, are used. This is, however, problematic because the learned low-dimensional nonlinear manifold is affected by the values of outlier elements, especially in corrupted data. We describe these methods in detail in Sect. 2. In this paper, we propose L0-norm Constrained Autoencoders (L0-AE), a novel reconstruction-based unsupervised outlier detection method that can learn lowdimensional manifolds under an l 0 -norm constraint for the error term using AE. Table 1 compares the features of different reconstruction-based methods.

Therefore, these methods do not have a mechanism that excludes outliers during training. In [8] , the equivalence of the global optimum of the VAE and RPCA is shown under the condition that a decoder has some kind of affinity; however, connections between VAE and RPCA are not shown for general nonlinear activation functions. The Discriminative Reconstruction Autoencoder (DRAE) [20] has been proposed for unsupervised outlier removal. DRAE labels samples for which reconstruction errors exceed a threshold as \"outliers\" and omits such samples for learning. To appropriately determine the threshold, the loss function of DRAE has an additional term to separate the reconstruction errors of inliers and outliers. Because of this additional term, DRAE does not solve an l 0 -norm constrained optimization problem, i.e., the learned manifold is affected by outlier values, which degrades the detection performance (see Sect. 5).",

In this experiment, because D = 2, we could not set the number of neurons and parameters as mentioned in Sect. 5.2; instead, for N-AE to achieve a high AUC, we used [2, 100, 1, 100, 2], which are empirically obtained. For RDA and RDA-Stbl, we used \u03bb = 0.00001; for DRAE, \u03bb = 0.1; and for L0-AE, C p = 0.2. These are chosen based on the AUC values. Table 3 reports the average of these measurements over 20 trials with different initial network weights, and Fig. 2 shows the distributions of outlierness of each method except RPCA in the first run. As VAE uses the probability as outlierness, only the AUC is included in Table 3 .

In contrast, the performances of the other AE-based methods are inferior to that of L0-AE because the other methods cannot completely exclude the influence of outliers. VAE is less accurate than the other AE-based methods; it is considered that VAE is unable to demonstrate robustness owing to the non-affinity of the decoder.

Table 4 presents the average AUCs for each dataset; Avg. AUC, Avg. rank, and Avg. time refer to the average AUC, the average rank over the datasets, and the average run-time, respectively. L0-AE demonstrates the highest average AUC and average rank. Among the reconstruction-based methods, L0-AE showed the highest AUCs for 8 out of 12 datasets. Especially on kdd99 rev, the AUC of L0-AE is considerably higher than those of the other AE-based methods. Because kdd99 rev has a high rate of outliers and they are distributed close to each other, the methods with l 1 -norm regularization and no regularization cannot avoid reconstructing the outliers, whereas L0-AE can almost completely avoid reconstruction because of its l 0norm constraint. Furthermore, we observed that the AUCs of RDA and RDA-Stbl are nearly equal. This shows the importance of the l 0 -norm constraint. L0-AE outperforms DRAE on average; it is considered that L0-AE selectively reconstructs only the inliers, while DRAE reconstructs inliers and reduces the variance of each label, allowing outliers to affect manifolds. In addition, the computational cost of DRAE is higher than that of L0-AE, owing to the calculation of the threshold. For VAE, the training was unstable for some datasets. One possible reason is that VAE involves random sampling in the reparametrization trick which increases the randomness of the results under these experimental settings. In contrast, among the AE-based methods, L0-AE showed stable results. RPCA results are relatively good in some datasets, suggesting that these datasets have linear features and l 0 -norm regularization works; L0-AE shows good performance by capturing nonlinear features even for the other datasets. The reason why RPCA outperforms some AE-based methods on average is that RPCA can automatically detect the rank of the inlier, while the AE-based methods have a fixed latent dimension (there is no known method for obtaining an appropriate latent dimension in an unsupervised setting).",

Overall, the maximum AUC values occur at C p values moderately greater than the true outlier rates. If C p is greater than the true outlier rate, outliers are safely detected as outliers; in contrast, there are inliers that are not trained to be reconstructed at an epoch. However, such inliers are also trained to be well reconstructed because inliers are likely to be distributed close to each other. If C p is less than the true outlier rate, the detection accuracy is basically better than in the case of N-AE (C p = 0) because some outliers are not reconstructed. For kdd99 rev, owing to the distribution of outliers as mentioned above, the outliers are unexpectedly detected as inliers when C p is small; for large C p values, such outliers are safely detected as outliers. Therefore, the change in AUC against C p is large. The development of an automatic optimal C p search method under the l 0 -norm constraint without the ground truth labels is an important future work. ",

The results of N-AE are also included for reference. In addition, Fig. 4 shows two transition examples of the values of the objective functions of RDA and L0-AE. Among them, Fig. 4(d) shows the result of the only trial in which the objective function increased in L0-AE; the epochs in which the objective function increased were 294 to 302 when C p = 0.3, with an average increase of 0.23, which is considerably less than the value of the objective function. In Table 5 and Fig. 4 , we observe that L0-AE shows good convergence regardless of the parameter C p , unlike RDA. This empirically demonstrates the validity of Theorem 1, which states that our alternating optimization algorithm converges when the gradientbased optimization behaves ideally. For RDA, when \u03bb is small, the value of the objective function is unstable, but when \u03bb is large, the characteristic of RDA approaches N-AE; therefore, the stability improves. We observe that, with N-AE, the values of objective function do not increase, which implies that our gradient-based optimization basically satisfies the assumption in Theorem 1. ",
