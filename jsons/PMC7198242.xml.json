Here we talk at length about the aspects like technology choice, design style guide, layout, widgets, charts, security, complex systems and more. As the solution we have developed is still in its infancy, Sect. 5 pinpoints the key ways our research is going to progress with the dashboard being one of the central tools. Finally, Sect. 6 brings out some reflections.",

His \u201cInformation dashboard design\u201d [4] is still being referenced by many. He starts by arguing that dashboards in the 1990s had major flaws, and that their root problem was in the inability to effectively communicate. Few also said that dashboards have to hold a balance between clarity and complexity [5]. With recent advances in the field of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design, dashboards started getting significantly more traction [6\u201310]. This resulted in dashboards being way more able to focus on the communication aspect, thus increasing use cases, leading to their wide-spread adoption [4]. Dashboard are becoming also of strategic importance in lean and agile environments [11, 12], to spread knowledge across workers [13, 14], and in distributed development environments [15\u201317].",

The main contribution can be directed into the energy efficient development of software in teams and individually. The proposed metrics were computed by applying rules common to the existing hierarchical measures of other internal software attributes. For example, by knowing the Number of classes in the source code we can easily calculate other metrics like: Number of Immediate sub-classes of a Class, Response for a Class, Weighted methods per Class as well as the Number of Children metric. It can be followed by better development estimates and more qualified product that can maintain the customers expectations. As it was stated in the paper [25], developers need a set of valid indicators in assisting the developers for better applications. Thus, the study results showed that Cyclomatic complexity, Number of classes, LOC, number of parameters, nested block depth, number of methods, weighted methods per class and method lines have direct relationship with power consumption of mobile applications. Authors of the paper [22] demonstrated specific coding practices for reading array length information, accessing class fields and performing invocations help to lower the overall energy consumption and improve the usability of the software.",
