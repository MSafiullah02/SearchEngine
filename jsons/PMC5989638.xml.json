Exclusion criteria included patients with a recent hospitalization (within the previous 28 days for immunocompetent patients and within 90 days for immunosuppressed patients), nursing home residents who were not functionally independent, patients who had undergone tracheostomy or gastrostomy, patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer with neutropenia, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the previous 90 days, active graft-vs-host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, HIV infection with a CD4 cell count < 200 mm3, and those with a nonpneumonia alternative diagnosis for the cause of acute respiratory symptoms. The study population for the current analysis included adults in the EPIC study who had adequate etiology testing (one test or more for bacteria and one test or more for viruses) and a chest radiograph obtained within 48 hours of enrollment.",

Initially, patients were enrolled based on interpretation of chest imaging as consistent with acute pneumonia by the clinicians or radiologists interpreting images for routine clinical care. Subsequently, all chest radiographs and CT scans obtained within 48 hours of admission were independently reviewed by a board-certified, study-dedicated thoracic radiologist blinded to the clinical data. The study included two thoracic radiologists (E. M. H. and F. C.), with one reading images from the three Chicago hospitals and the other reading images from the two Nashville hospitals. These radiologists used the same protocol and data collection form when interpreting images and recording their findings. Available chest imaging prior to the current hospitalization was used to help distinguish between acute and chronic findings.",

Patients were classified as having CT scan evidence of pneumonia if the radiologist indicated possible, probable, or definite pneumonia.",

Patients with residual serum collected at hospital presentation also had serum procalcitonin (PCT) measured for research purposes using the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT immunoassay kit (BioMerieux, Inc.).18, 19 The lower limit of detection for this assay was 0.05 ng/mL. PCT results were not available to clinicians and were not used for patient management. Prior research suggests a PCT threshold of 0.25 ng/mL can help distinguish between viral and bacterial infection20, 21; therefore, PCT was analyzed on a continuous scale and also dichotomized as < 0.25 ng/mL (low) vs \u2265 0.25 ng/mL (high). We also reported the proportion of patients who received antibiotics within 6 and 12 hours of hospital presentation and the specific antibiotics used for initial empirical treatment, defined as antibiotics delivered on the first day of hospitalization, including those given in the ED.",

These findings support managing patients with CT-only pneumonia according to the same principles used for those with pneumonia on chest radiography, including the selection of empirical antibiotics and site of care. Additionally, these results suggest that pneumonia that is visible only on CT scan can be associated with significant physiological abnormalities and morbidity, and hence, support using CT imaging to evaluate for pneumonia when the clinical presentation is suggestive of pneumonia but an initial chest radiograph does not demonstrate radiological signs of pneumonia and identification of pneumonia as the cause of clinical symptoms is important.

Among the 308 patients with clinically suspected pneumonia in the Claessens et al study, 40 (13%) had CT-only pneumonia, and clinicians typically responded to a positive CT scan for pneumonia after a normal chest radiograph by administering antibiotics. Our results complement those of Claessens et al by suggesting that the pathogens and clinical outcomes associated with CT-only pneumonia do indeed warrant consideration for antibiotic therapy. Claessens et al7 also found that 18% of patients in their study had a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia but a CT scan without evidence of pneumonia, and clinicians were likely to discontinue antibiotics and change the disposition from inpatient to outpatient based on results of the CT scan demonstrating no pneumonia. Our data also support a clinical decision to use normal CT scans to de-escalate care based on a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia. In our study, only one of 30 patients with a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia and a CT scan without evidence of pneumonia had a bacterial pathogen detected, and CT images often clarified the abnormality seen on chest radiograph as a nonpneumonia finding.",

            "text": "There were limitations to our study. First, the use of CT imaging was determined by treating clinicians independent of the study protocol; clinicians elected to perform CT imaging in approximately one-third of the patients in the cohort. As noted in e-Table 1, patients with chest pain, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis were more likely to undergo CT imaging, likely due to clinicians\u2019 concerns for pulmonary embolism or cancer in patients with these symptoms; therefore, study results may not be generalizable to patients whose clinicians are not concerned enough to order chest CT imaging. Second, because radiological evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography or CT scanning was required for cohort inclusion, we did not evaluate patients with clinically suspected pneumonia who had a chest radiograph without evidence of pneumonia and no CT imaging performed. If CT imaging was systematically completed on these patients, additional cases of CT-only pneumonia would likely have been discovered. Third, patients were considered to have CT-only pneumonia if a CT scan showing evidence of pneumonia was completed on the same day or the day following a chest radiograph that showed no signs of pneumonia, and both imaging studies were completed within 2 days of hospital admission. Only including patients who had a CT scan obtained immediately after a chest radiograph (within minutes or hours) may have decreased the discordance between chest radiography and CT imaging; however, considering a CT scan and chest radiograph performed within 1 calendar day of each other as concurrent imaging is consistent with clinical practice in which routine chest imaging more frequently than once per day is not recommended.4 Fourth, multiple comparisons between groups were performed, and differences observed should be considered hypothesis generating. Fifth, although this is the largest study to date assessing clinical outcomes of patients with CT-only pneumonia, our sample size was somewhat limited, precluding multivariable analyses and robust comparisons of rare outcomes, such as mortality. Sixth, nearly all patients were treated with antibiotics; hence, the impact of antibiotics on clinical outcomes could not be evaluated. Finally, only hospitalized patients were included in this study, and generalizability to the outpatient setting is unknown.",
