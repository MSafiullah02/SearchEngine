This sequencing method, also known as Sanger sequencing, is based on specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerase [8, 9] and was subsequently the most widely used sequencing method for the next 30 years. Sanger sequencing was able to obtain the sequence of DNA as long as 1000 bp with high accuracy. However, this low-throughput sequencing method was expensive, time consuming and insufficient to achieve the ultimate goal of deciphering the complicated biological genome. These weaknesses drove the development of high-throughput sequencing: NGS.",

This approach has significantly expanded our knowledge about gene heterogeneity, not only with regard to sequences of DNA and RNA but also their modifications, such as methylation [10]. Different NGS platforms are distinguished by the technologies used in sequencing, including pyrosequencing, sequencing-by-synthesis technology, and ion semiconductor sequencing [11]. The principles and advantages of each platform have been reviewed by Anderson et al. [12] in detail. Common processes shared by these platforms are DNA library construction, sequencing in the machine, and output data analysis. Bioinformatics analysis is used to piece the fragments together by mapping the individual reads to the reference genome. NGS directly shows the gene variants in physiological and pathological states. Combined with newly developed computational tools and published databases, such as String and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), further conclusions can be drawn from differentially expressed genes, including prediction of protein-protein interaction and construction of signaling pathways [13]. In turn, the sequencing data also enrich the databases, providing guidance for genetic diseases and clinical diagnostics [14].",

Traditional sequencing technologies analyze bulk tissue samples composed of millions of cells. However, most organisms are composed of various cells. These average expression data have difficultly resolving cell-to-cell variations and fail to identify rare cells that may play a crucial role in physiological or pathological progression. SCS methods provide a way to comprehensively profile genetic, epigenetic, spatial, and lineage information in individual cells. Integrating SCS data can construct holistic representations of the cell state, reveal intrinsic regulatory networks, uncover cell-cell crosstalk, identify rare cell types, and predict potential roles of these cells [16]. With the help of SCS, especially scRNA-seq, and bioinformatics analysis, myeloid cell heterogeneity and ontogeny in bone marrow have been revealed, which has been reviewed by Schultze et al. [17] in detail. These new findings have encouraged people to rethink the immune microenvironment in the lung, which consists of resident leukocytes, local stromal cells, and their interactions. Even though published reports are not abundant, several scRNA-seq studies in lung tissue have identified distinct myeloid cell types and their dynamic changes during development and pathological processes [18, 19]. By ligand-receptor mapping, new cell-cell crosstalk has also been revealed.",

Today, SCS technologies lead medical research towards greater innovation and significant discoveries. Combined with bioinformatics analysis, we are able to substantially expand our knowledge in understanding cell-cell crosstalk and networking, identifying new cell phenotypes and subtypes, determining cell trajectory, and so on (Fig. 1). These findings can provide us with new insights into the mechanisms of lung homeostasis and diseases and thus suggest new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\n",

The immune system in the lung consists of leukocytes migrating from hematopoietic sites and lung stromal cells. Proper immune component development is essential for homeostasis, and dysregulation of immune function may lead to disease, such as tissue inflammation, fibrosis, or cancer [22]. Studies with scRNA-seq analysis have provided us with paradigm changing insights into the dynamic alterations in cell diversity during lung development. Cohen et al. [18] profiled the immune and nonimmune lung cells by scRNA-seq, showing that cell composition varies widely along major timepoints in lung development, from the 12.5-day embryonic lung to postnatal 7 days. In the early embryo timepoint (E12.5), over 50% of immune cells are macrophages, while monocytes are the dominant cell type in the canalicular stage of lung development (E16.5). Later, all major immune cell populations are present in late pregnancy. On the postnatal 7th day, the lymphoid cell compartment, B cells and T cells, make up of 32% of the CD45+ population. These findings show the dynamic changes in cell components during development, which provide guidance for further studies on cellular dynamics, differentiation and maturation of the lung.",

            "text": "The alveolar macrophage (AM) is a self-maintaining tissue-specific cell type in lung tissue. Previous studies have shown that AMs originate from fetal liver embryonic precursors [23]. This theory has been confirmed by the slingshot trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data of mouse lung, which showed that macrophages in the late embryonic phase and postnatal time form a continuous transcriptional spectrum with E16.5 monocytes [24, 25]. However, these AMs are mature macrophages in alveolae. As characterized by highly expressed peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), AM gene signatures, including fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), and integrin alpha X (ITG\u03b1X), are only observed in postnatal mice. ScRNA-seq data from mice show that not all of the macrophages that appear during lung development turn into AMs [18]. In early pregnancy, macrophages express high levels of chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and complement genes, including complement component 1 q subcomponents alpha and beta (C1q\u03b1, C1q\u03b2). However, this type of macrophage is diminished in the later canalicular stage without differentiating into a mature AM. It is postulated that this type of macrophage might be involved in the mechanisms of some spontaneous pulmonary illnesses, although the actual effect of these macrophages is still unclear.",

In the murine lung, AMs are the major population in alveolar spaces, while a minor population of interstitial macrophages (IMs) reside within the lung parenchyma. Transcriptome analysis identified that AMs highly express keratin 79 (KRT79), keratin 19 (KRT19), and carbonic anhydrase 4 (CAR4) compared with expression in other types of macrophages [29]. Human AMs, however, exhibit poor antigen presentation function due to the lack of expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD86 [30]. In addition, murine AMs show decreased phagocytic activity compared with that of lung IMs [31] and express low levels of CD11b, which is related to integrin activity [32].

These phenotypic changes in specific gene signatures in lung basophils represent functional shifting. AMs from lung basophil-depleted mice shared some genes with immature macrophages and showed deficiency in anti-inflammatory ability and phagocytic properties, suggesting that the changes in the basophil gene signature are important to the differentiation and phagocytic properties of macrophages through basophil-macrophage interaction [18, 35].",

Interestingly, Retnlg is detected at low levels in granulocytes in peripheral blood [39]. Studies on the function of Retnlg are lacking. Since Retnlg is usually found in the extracellular region or secreted in plasma [40], it is speculated that it may potentially promote chemotaxis of myeloid cells [41]. Although the function of Retnlg in neutrophils is still unclear, high expression of Retnlg in pulmonary neutrophils may suggest a role for these neutrophils in further inducing myeloid cells into the lung, which may contribute to amplified innate immune cell infiltration in the lung in response to inflammation.",

            "text": "Lung fibrosis is often a late stage process in many lung diseases, such as those caused by toxicity and infection. In a prevailing theory, lung fibrosis occurs due to fibroblast proliferation after an initial insult to the alveolar epithelium and subsequent proinflammatory response [58]. Fibroblasts invade the epithelial layer to plug wounds. However, in some cases, fibroblasts fail to undergo apoptosis and continue to generate stiff tissue, resulting in irreversible alveolar collapse. The mechanisms of lung fibrosis are not fully elucidated but are believed to be a result of the interaction of many factors. Using NGS approaches, genetic studies on pulmonary fibrosis have made great progress, most of which have led to the discovery of mutations in genes related to telomere homeostasis [59]. Whole-lung transcriptome profiling showed dysregulated canonical pathways in the fibrosis mouse model, including the pathways for bacteria/virus recognition, inflammation, leukocyte extravasation, and ROS production [60]. By using scRNA-seq, Peyser et al. [61] found that early events in lung fibrosis might not involve significant changes in fibroblast number, while the numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and proliferating myeloid cells are increased. These increased cells may be involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Distinct monocyte and macrophage subtypes have been found in the development of fibrosis [62, 63]. Reyfman et al. [64] performed scRNA-seq on lung tissue obtained from eight transplant donors and their eight counterpart recipients with pulmonary fibrosis. The data revealed that AM genes originating from the lungs of patients with fibrosis were enriched in \u201cexocytosis\u201d, \u201csecretion\u201d, \u201cregulation of cell migration\u201d and \u201cextracellular matrix organization\u201d. By using scRNA-seq on a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model, Aran et al. [63] identified a profibrotic macrophage subpopulation expressing the specific markers CX3CR1 and SiglecF, which localized at the sites of fibrotic scarring where Pdgfra+ and Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts accumulated. This finding suggests an important role of the macrophage subpopulation in the regulation of fibroblasts. Regarding the source of the profibrotic macrophages, the study showed that the macrophages partially shared a gene expression profile with both alveolar and interstitial macrophages, suggesting a transitional state of resident lung macrophages that is initiated following injury. Not only macrophages but also distinct monocytes, characterized by Ceacam1+Msr1+Ly6C\u2212F4/80\u2212Mac1+ and termed segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatMs), were also found in the bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model, suggesting a role for these cells in the progression of fibrosis. Notably, the differentiation of SatMs was dependent on CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2), which usually plays a crucial role in the maturation and differentiation of granulocytes [37]. These results indicate that targeting myeloid cells is a potential novel strategy for the prevention and therapy of lung fibrosis.",

            "text": "COPD is a common outcome of chronic lung inflammation, characterized by reduced lung function. With regard to the infiltrating myeloid cells, there are two main phenotypes of COPD, neutrophil-associated COPD and eosinophil-associated COPD [65]. Neutrophilic inflammation is the most common inflammatory phenotype in COPD, which is mainly activated by proinflammatory mediators and DAMPs released by epithelial cells and resident macrophages under stimuli [66]. Recruited neutrophils subsequently release proteases, induce airway damage, and activate adaptive immune Th1 and Th17 cells [66, 67]. For eosinophil-associated COPD, patients usually show a higher risk of severe exacerbations [68]. NGS data have now shown a greater diversity of COPD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on COPD patients have identified several COPD-associated genome variants, suggesting that COPD is a disease with genetic predisposition and altered immunity [69, 70]. By analyzing large-airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, and peripheral blood samples from COPD patients by RNA-seq, Morrow et al. [71] observed a significant overlap in genes from large-airway epithelium and macrophage for smoking and airway disease phenotypes, including cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1) and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR). CYP1B1 is involved in oxidative metabolism, while AHRR mediates dioxin toxicity due to its DNA binding effect. These results highlight the shared tissue-specific signatures of lung disease and damage. Furthermore, RNA-seq profiling revealed some significantly associated emphysema genes, including asparaginase-like 1 (ASRGL1), latrophilin 2 (LPHN2), and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) [72]. Of note, most studies employed nasal and bronchial brushing samples from COPD patients, and thus, the samples were a mix of multi-cell populations, which should include epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, infiltrated neutrophils and many others. Studies using mixed-cell samples may reveal genes for COPD susceptibility and identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction; however, these studies fail to elucidate the roles of different cells in the process of COPD.",

            "text": "Tumor heterogeneity is a significant cause of the poor therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. SCS technology provides a better approach to studying tumor microenvironments and heterogeneity. Immune cells show distinct gene signatures in tumor patients in high or low risk groups in terms of overall survival [73]. In addition, intratumoral immune cell densities, including dentric cells (DCs), neutrophils, macrophages and CD8+ T cells, were associated with molecular alterations in lung adenocarcinoma patients, underlying the interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment [74]. The heterogeneity of both tumor cells and immune cells have potential impacts on the efficacy of immunotherapy, especially for optimal personalized immunotherapy [75\u201377]. Studies show that peripheral blood immune cells are altered in lung cancer patients [78]. Zilionis et al. [19] compared tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and peripheral blood immune cells of the same patients by scRNA-seq, and the data showed only partial overlap in the states of the two groups, suggesting that immune populations can be reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment [79]. Considering that tumor microenvironments are varied, several studies have analyzed the tumor-infiltrating populations in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by scRNA-seq. The studies revealed distinct phenotypes of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages in patients and mouse models [19, 76, 80, 81].",

However, scRNA-seq revealed the transcriptional plasticity of neutrophils, which express significant phenotypes in NSCLC [82]. These phenotypes play both protumoral and antitumoral roles [83, 84]. The distinct phenotypes could be the result of the development of specific progenitor cells or reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. In bone marrow, Zhu et al. [36] found that Lin\u2212CD117+Ly6a/e\u2212 cells were a distinct neutrophil progenitor population with protumoral activity. In the lung, neutrophils that highly express sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin F (SiglecF) have been found in mice with tumors and exhibit several protumor functions [85], while SiglecFlow cells are found in tumor-free lungs. SiglecFhigh neutrophils overexpressed colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) transcripts [19]. These molecules have been previously found in tumor cells and have been identified as playing protumoral roles [86\u201388]. A new study showed that CCL3, cystatin B (CSTB), cathepsin B (CTSB), and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2), molecules that are involved in the inflammatory response of neutrophils, are specifically found in neutrophils from mice with tumors [19]. To our knowledge, these transcripts may not be able to promote cell proliferation and/or differentiation. However, they are potentially involved in the development of the immune microenvironment and provide an increased probability for tumor immune escape.",

Today, SCS technology is being quickly developed. For example, recent efforts have pioneered methods to record spatial information. The majority of current studies are focused on measurements of a single modality. The combinatorially barcoded profiling technology makes it possible to combine multimodal technologies. With the help of integrative computational methods, it will be possible to build a comprehensive molecular view of cells and tissue states based on the substantial information derived from SCS. NGS will, no doubt, be largely beneficial in finding new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases.",

Several platforms are available, including Drop-seq, Smart-seq2, MARS-seq, and 10X Genomics. 2. scDNA-seq & methylation: Also known as single-cell genomic sequencing, whole genomic DNA from individual cells is captured, amplified, and sequenced. scDNA-seq can provide information on copy numbers and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). 3. scATAC-seq: A single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, provides a way to understand the regulatory landscape of the genome. 4. scCHIP-seq: Single-cell chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing reveals the epigenetic heterogeneity in individual cells. 5. Single-cell immune profiling: A comprehensive approach to simultaneously examine the cellular context of the adaptive immune response and immune repertoires of T and B cells on a cell-by-cell basis. This approach can reveal insights into T and B cell variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes, known as V(D)J recombination, and immune cell profiling. 6. Spatial transcriptomics: An array containing capture probes is employed to bind RNA from tissue sections, and cDNA is then synthesized, followed by preparation of sequence libraries. The libraries are then sequenced, providing information on what genes are expressed, the changing quantities, and where the cells derive from. 7. Cell surface protein + SCS: This approach simultaneously measures both gene and cell surface protein expression in the same cell. As shown in the right panel of the figure, by applying bioinformatics tools and computational analysis, this SCS technology can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory relationships between genes, track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development, and many other applications",
