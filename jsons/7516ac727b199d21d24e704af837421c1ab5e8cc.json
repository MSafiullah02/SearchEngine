Although in Hubei the number of laboratory-confirmed cases ( ) C t was observed to grow exponentially in early January (13) , the subsequent rise followed a subexponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law \u03bc t with an exponent \u03bc 2.3 = (between Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A . For the majority of the affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this type of algebraic rise occurred from the beginning of case reporting on Jan. 21st. The exponents \u03bc fluctuate around a typical value of \u03bc 2.1 0.3 = \u00b1 for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than 500 on Feb. 12th), displaying algebraic growth despite geographical, socio-economical differences, possible differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneities that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B -C. Eventually, case counts began to deviate from the observed scaling laws around Feb. 9th for Hubei and in early February for the remaining provinces, approaching a saturation behavior.",

Three questions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason for this functional dependency, (ii) are provinces other than Hubei mostly driven by export cases from Hubei and therefore follow a similar functional form in case counts as suggested by preliminary studies discussing the influence of human travel (14) (15) (16) , or, alternatively, (iii) is the scaling law a consequence of endogenous and basic epidemiological processes, caused by a balance between transmission events and containment efforts. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases. In the following, we will provide evidence that the implementation of effective containment strategies that target both susceptibles and infecteds can account for the observed growth behavior.",

For instance, many people wore face masks in public spaces and followed stricter hygiene procedures concerning hand washing, universities remained closed, many businesses closed down, and people were asked to remain in their homes for as much time as possible, in several places enforced by mandatory curfews. Another standard strategy that Chinese authorities applied was contact tracing (17) , where possible transmission chains between known infecteds and their contacts were identified and suspected cases were isolated at home before symptom onset. While very effective in interrupting the transmission process and thereby shielding large numbers of susceptibles from acquiring the infection, contact tracing becomes infeasible when the number of infected grows rapidly in a short amount of time or when an undetected outbreak leads to a large number of unidentifiable infecteds, as was the case in Hubei.",

Furthermore, the model also captures the immediate subexponential growth observed in the remaining most affected provinces (Fig. 2B-C) . Again, saturation is induced by a decay of unidentified infecteds after peaks that occur several days before peak time in Hubei, ranging from Jan. 31st to Feb. 4th. For all provinces, following their respective peaks, the number of unidentified infecteds ( ) I t decays over a time period that is longer than the reported estimation of maximum incubation period of 14 days (4, 20). It is important to note that the numerical value of unidentified infecteds is sensitive to parameter variations-the general shape of ( ) I t , however, is robust for a wide choice of parameters, as discussed in the Materials and Methods.",

The remaining fit parameters are shown in table S1. For these values, the effective basic reproduction number is found to range between 0,eff 1.4 3.3 R \u2264 \u2264 for the discussed provinces, consistent with estimates found in previous early assessment studies (4, 8, 21, 22) . We discuss these parameters and their possible range in the Materials and Methods. On Feb. 12th, case counting procedures were altered regarding the outbreak in Hubei to include cases that were clinically diagnosed and not laboratory-confirmed. Consequently, about 15,000 new cases were added on a single day, compared to about 1,500 new cases on the day before. We therefore only use data predating Feb. 12 to estimate model parameters for the most affected provinces and compare the obtained predictions with subsequent cases numbers. We find that for all provinces other than Hubei, our predictions accurately reflect the empirical observations ( Fig.  2B-C) . Omitting the aforementioned discontinuity that arises in the empirical data, the saturating behavior of cases in Hubei is consistent with the prediction, as well. Subtracting the clinically diagnosed cases of Feb. 12 from the number of cases in Hubei, our model underestimates the final count of laboratory-confirmed cases in Hubei by 4%. In the remaining part of Mainland China we underestimate the final case count by 7% (as of Mar. 28th).",

This general shape of growth suggests that fundamental principles are at work associated with this particular outbreak that are dominated by the interplay of the contagion process with endogenous behavioral changes in the susceptible population and external containment policies. While the explicit shape of the growth curves discussed here can be influenced by factors such as seasonal effects, systematic delay in reporting, or heterogeneities in demographic structure and population mixing, the fact that total case numbers eventually reached a stable value suggests that containment strategies that shielded the susceptible population from the transmission process were rather effective-compared to potential case numbers of an unmitigated outbreak, only a small fraction of the Chinese population that was at risk has been infected up to date (Mar. 29th). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that other factors contributed to the growth behavior displayed in the data that was collected in a short amount of time during a tense situation.",

All fits were performed for case numbers predating Feb. 12th at which the case number definition was temporarily changed for Hubei, adding approximately 15, 000 cases at once. Consequently, confirmed case numbers after Feb. 12th are well captured by the model for all provinces but Hubei. Fit parameters are given in table S1. (A) In Hubei, the model captures both, the initial rise of confirmed cases as well as the subsequent algebraic growth. The confirmed cases were predicted to saturate at 51, 000 C = . The model also predicts the timecourse of the number of unidentified infectious individuals ( ) I t which peaks on Feb. 7th and declines exponentially afterwards. While the magnitude of ( ) I t is associated with rather large fluctuations due to uncertainties in the fitting parameters, the predicted peak time is robust, consistently around Feb. 7th.
