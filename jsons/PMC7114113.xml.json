This represents a major challenge for the management of infectious disease risks and is likely to require a paradigm shift in analytical approaches rather than an evolution of existing ones. This change in approach is reflected in the widespread recognition of the need to adopt inter- and transdisciplinary approaches in risk research and management. In addition, the digital revolution has provided major opportunities with respect to data collection and analysis. This has now evolved into the Internet of Things where everyday objects are connected through information networks, allowing them to send and receive data (Anon., 2014b, Kamel Boulos and Al-Shorbaji, 2014). Related to this, is the so-called Industry 4.0 (a collective term for technologies and concepts of value chain organisation; (Lee et al., 2014)), which reflects a vision for how the industrial sector may respond to the tight integration between the physical and digital world through the implementation of smart value chains.",

We begin this review from a broader perspective by focussing on the developments that have led to the data revolution and its impact on the health sciences. We then discuss how the new scientific discipline of data science has been established to tackle the analytical challenges and opportunities resulting from the data revolution. From this wider analytical context, we then focus on the specific developments in spatio-temporal epidemiological data analysis resulting from the data revolution.",

However, the way in which data are generated has changed radically over the last 30 years, mainly as a result of the emergence of electronic methods for measuring, recording, storing and distributing data. As part of this development, the Internet now forms the backbone of a globally-reaching information network. The drivers behind the data revolution have been multiple, and early on were dominated by defence, public safety and scientific interests. Only once commercial companies such as Google (https://www.google.com), Amazon (http://www.amazon.com) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com) were able to demonstrate, during the last 10 years, the potential for commercial exploitation, did the data revolution truly take off. There are also now increasing concerns in relation to potential abuse of Big Data (Schadt, 2012, Anon., 2014a).",

            "text": "Traditional database management systems based on tabular or relational data management structures are not suited to dealing with Big Data as most of it is unstructured. Cloud-based data storage using the Apache Hadoop\u00ae distributed file system (http://hadoop.apache.org; last accessed April 2015) has been developed to allow efficient management of such data (O\u2019Driscoll et al., 2013, Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014). A data mining approach was used to explore the use of search term data for prediction of flu trends (Ginsberg et al., 2009) based on the assumption that changes in information and communication patterns on the Internet can act as early warning of changes in population health (Wilson and Brownstein, 2009). This resulted in the development of the search-term surveillance system, Google Flu Trends (GFT; http://www.google.org/flutrend, last accessed April 2015). By combining data-mining of Google search queries and statistical modelling, GFT provides a baseline indicator of the trend or changes in the rate of influenza, thereby providing estimates of weekly regional US influenza activity with a reporting lag of only one day compared with the 1\u20132 week delays associated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Influenza Sentinel Provider Surveillance reports (Ginsberg et al., 2009). However, the results generated by this algorithm have been the subject of controversy as predictions were incorrect at specific time points when they particularly mattered (Butler, 2013, Lazer et al., 2014). The fact remains though, that the relative immediacy of web-based surveillance systems allows for much quicker targeting of infection hot-spots in pandemic situations, as was done by companies such as Google, in the recent influenza H1N1 crisis (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010, Signorini et al., 2011, St Louis and Zorlu, 2012).",

As such, although web-based surveillance systems are still a long way from replacing traditional surveillance methods, they provide a useful complement to conventional approaches (Milinovich et al., 2014), to the extent that they have become an important component of the influenza surveillance scene. For example, WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN; http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/, last accessed May 2015) use such data as part of their day-to-day surveillance activities (Grein et al., 2000, Heymann and Rodier, 2001) and are authorised to act on this information (Wilson et al., 2008). Moving from surveillance to delivery of health care, precision medicine aims to utilise Big Data for the purpose of optimising the use of diagnostic tools, therapeutics and preventive management (Anon., 2011, Collins and Varmus, 2015).",

It is very likely that more widespread utilisation and better adaptation of these digital technologies will provide an opportunity for more effective traceability of livestock and their products and animal health surveillance.

Up until about five to ten years ago, the challenge associated with analysing epidemiological data sourced from existing, and sometimes collated across, multiple data sources was addressed using secondary data analysis approaches (Sorensen et al., 1996, Olsen, 2008). The associated methodological developments were strongly underpinned by the well-established principles of the scientific method, with data analysis primarily being the responsibility of statistical science. While most epidemiologists will have experienced the technical challenges associated with data management, it is notable that most postgraduate epidemiology training programmes primarily focus on tabular, while barely covering, relational databases.",

He suggested that in the Petabyte Age, hypothesis-driven research would become irrelevant and be replaced by mining of data for associations. This extreme view has resulted in some debate (Norvig, 2009, Pigliucci, 2009, Schutt and O\u2019Neil, 2013, Faghmous and Kumar, 2014, Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier, 2014). Arguably, this debate has had the benefit that scientists reflected on the utility of their respective research methodologies. It has also re-emphasised the importance of knowledge discovery going beyond the development of descriptive models optimised for mathematical accuracy. The renewed belief in the development of increasingly more powerful artificial intelligence applications also emphasises the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms (Jones, 2014, Gibney, 2015, Scholkopf, 2015, You, 2015). This does not mean that statistical algorithms will become less relevant, as is reflected in the current trend towards synergistic method development between the computer and statistical sciences (Kuhn and Johnson, 2014, Peters et al., 2014).",

As such, it emphasises the importance of integrating computer science, statistical science, specialist domain expertise and social science. Conway (2010) had not explicitly separated social science from specialist domain expertise, but it seems justified to separate it out given that human behaviour has a major influence on the characteristics of most data sources. Arguably, this perspective is very similar to the interdisciplinary approach that underpins One Health and Ecohealth.",

Starting with the Innovation Trigger phase and rapidly climbing the Peak of Inflated Expectations, the cycle then descends into the Trough of Disillusionment (with respect to expectations). From there it may ascend the Slope of Enlightenment before finally reaching the Plateau of Productivity.

They report a need for interdisciplinary tool development to allow valid integrated analysis of data sourced from different areas such as molecular, network and population data. Similarly, not all crowdsourced information is of equal quality; some data are of higher quality than others just as some contributors are consistently better than others (Haklay, 2010). The inclusion of robust measures of quality for VGI would be useful to indicate the level of confidence associated with each piece of information, and although traditional statistical concepts of uncertainty and bias are hard to apply to VGI, other options are available. For example, See et al. (2013) found that when classifying land-cover, volunteer accuracy appeared to be higher when responses for a given location were more consistent and when the volunteers indicated higher confidence in their responses, suggesting that these additional pieces of information could be used to develop associated robust measures of quality. Additional possibilities include the application of Bayesian probability or Dempster\u2013Shafer theory (Eastman, 2009) to provide measures of confidence.",

Data-driven approaches can be further sub-divided depending on whether they require both disease presence and absence data to calibrate the model, or presence-only data. Alternatively, with knowledge-driven methods, risk estimates are derived based on existing or hypothesised understanding of the causal relationships leading to disease occurrence (Stevens and Pfeiffer, 2011, Stevens et al., 2013).",

Machine learning regression modelling used to consist primarily of classification tree analysis (Breiman et al., 1984), but in recent years this approach has been more or less replaced by random forest and boosted regression tree methods. These approaches are considered to be less affected by missing values, non-linearity, autocorrelation, lack of independence and distributional assumptions than parametric methods. In addition, several comparative reviews of the performance of the different species distribution modelling methods (Hirzel et al., 2006, Elith and Graham, 2009, Fran\u00e7a and Cabral, 2015) suggest that, in general, tree-based regression methods tend to perform slightly better than other spatial regression approaches.

This is also common in ecological species distribution modelling and has led to the development of different sampling approaches to generate pseudo-absence data that can be used with regression methods requiring both presence and absence data, as well as the development of specific modelling techniques requiring presence-only data such as the ecological niche modelling (ENM) methods including ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent) (Hirzel et al., 2002, Elith and Leathwick, 2009).

Further, combining ENM and phylogeography can be particularly informative for studies of globally distributed pathogens where environmental associations may be linked to genetic variation. From a methodological perspective, knowing that certain lineages exhibit niche specialisation and unique geographic distributions, can improve model accuracy by dividing a large population into biologically meaningful sub-populations (Mullins et al., 2013). However, ignoring such genetic variations may result in ENM which are biased towards a dominant strain in a particular region.

This is particularly the case for dynamic modelling, but also for static approaches such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). A key characteristic of these modelling approaches is their emphasis on inter-disciplinarity in that system understanding generated by different disciplines needs to be integrated so that the particular modelling objectives can be meaningfully achieved. Big Data is unlikely to result in the demise of the need for use of expert opinion and integration of existing knowledge such as MCDA, particularly in the context of management of new and emerging risks.",

However, he highlights that the methodologies are frequently used without taking account of the method\u2019s underlying assumptions. More recently, Malczewski (2010) and Hongoh et al.

Both applied Dempster\u2013Shafer theory to explicitly express and propagate uncertainty in relation to knowledge about the underlying processes expressed in the decision rules. de Glanville et al. (2014) generated suitability maps for African swine fever for Africa and used Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis to express uncertainty in relation to model outputs. Other animal health applications of spatial MCDA have addressed animal diseases such as African horse sickness in Spain and Rift Valley fever in Italy (Tran et al., 2013, Sanchez-Matamoros et al., 2014). The increasing use of MCDA in the environmental sciences has resulted in further development of MCDA methodologies to reduce the influence of subjectivity of individual criteria weights on the risk score outcome (Yemshanov et al., 2013, Feizizadeh et al., 2014, Jankowski et al., 2014, Ligmann-Zielinska and Jankowski, 2014).",

The latter involves technological and scientific advances which have, and will, generate opportunities for more effective management of current, and new and emerging infectious disease threats. Big Data, together with the Internet of Things, has introduced a new way of collecting and analysing data that is very different from the hypothesis-driven approaches previously accepted by the international scientific community as the primary mechanism for generating new scientific knowledge. Within the area of epidemiological analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data, Big Data associated technologies and data sources have, so far, had limited impact, with the main advances having been associated with machine learning modelling methods, the recent use of mobile phone location records, molecular diagnostic and animal movement data. To more effectively harness the opportunities offered by these new digital technologies in animal and human health, an interdisciplinary approach will have to be embraced which, in addition to the various scientific domains associated with human, animal and environmental health, also includes computer science. This will result in a particularly interesting situation for epidemiologists whose scientific strength has been the integration between the applied health sciences and the more theoretical and abstract methods underpinning statistical analysis, to which they could now add the role of acting as an interface with the computer science aspects of Big Data and the Internet of Things. By doing so they will be able to continue their substantial contribution to the understanding of cause-effect relationships in eco-social systems, and thereby expand the knowledge-base underpinning effective animal health risk management.",
