A recent review of vaccine patches identified sufficient maturity of the technology to consider vaccine patches as a platform, but highlighted the lack of financial incentives as a barrier to the commercialization and licensing of vaccine patches as new products [10] . Briefly, vaccine manufacturers would need to make substantial investments to (i) conduct large-scale clinical trials, (ii) adopt and scale up new manufacturing capacity to make the patches under Good Manufacturing Practices, and (iii) manage the complicated regulatory submissions required for new platforms and new vaccine products [10] .",

In contrast, the US private market pre-excise vaccine price is not similarly constrained (although the same nominal $0.75 per vaccine excise tax applies), and thus manufacturers can potentially recover some costs associated with improvements and/or post-market activities for existing vaccines in the US from the private sector. This represents an important opportunity for vaccine manufacturers to cover the costs of post-market research, some marginal improvements in production processes, and/or product-related communication activities, including investments made to counter claims of harms associated with vaccines (e.g., to defend their products against false claims).",

The imperfect market conditions favor the economies of scale that come with one or a few vaccine producers (monopolies or oligopolies) serving the entire market for many vaccines. The lack of competition reduces incentives for a vaccine manufacturer to invest in innovations in incremental changes that will not affect its market share. Thus, although technological innovations (e.g., adjuvants, enhanced potency, vaccine vial monitors, new vaccine delivery technologies) could potentially make existing vaccines more effective, cheaper to produce, less likely to be wasted, and/or easier to administer, limited recognition of the potential benefits of these improved products combined with the cost and time of developing them to licensure can serve as a barrier to investment in the US market [9] . However, when the market size and potential return appears justifiable to the manufacturer, then this leads to notable exceptions like the development of Shingrix\u2122. GSK invested in the development of two-dose, adjuvanted Shingrix\u2122 despite the existing licensure and use of onedose Zostavax\u2122, which led to a substantially more effective vaccine that offered longer-lasting protection, became the preferred vaccine, and drove Zostavax\u2122 out of the market [14] .",

The costs of developing a new vaccine typically exceed more than $1 billion (current US dollars) spent over approximately 10 years of time for research, regulatory testing and compliance, and the development of mass production capacity to bring a new licensed vaccine product to market [16, 17] . The complexity of the science, and the high costs and uncertainties about overcoming multiple challenges to cross the translational \"valleys of death\" (i.e., the large gaps between basic scientific research and widespread use of novel therapeutics) [18, 19] limit interest in investment in vaccine innovation to some degree. Specifically, manufacturers must overcome multiple challenges, including the need to determine what is a protective immune response and demonstrate the ability of the vaccine product to induce it. This typically initially involves animal studies, and then conducting progressively larger, time-consuming, costly, and often unsuccessful human clinical studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Most importantly, these time-consuming and expensive steps must be repeated for substantial modifications of existing vaccines, with the modified product required to minimally show non-inferiority in safety and/or effectiveness compared to the existing product, and to demonstrate measurable benefit in order to receive a preferential recommendation by the ACIP, which reduces enthusiasm for incremental improvements.",

However, the US discontinued all use of multiuse nozzle jet injectors due to the potential for bloodborne pathogen transmission risks (from insufficient cleaning between multiple uses) [28] . Subsequent development of disposable-syringe jet injectors led to a functional alternative in the US, but their use can only occur with vaccines for which the vaccine label explicitly allows use of the specific device [28] . Using disposable-syringe jet injectors thus increases the cost of delivery, both to get the indication included on the label (e.g., Afluria seasonal influenza vaccine [38] ) and to pay for the incremental cost of the device and disposable components compared to syringe and needle). To date, these devices do not see widespread use in the US. However, following the US Food and Drug Administration approval of Seqirus Afluria\u2122 vaccine administration by the PharmaJet Stratis\u2122 device for adults in 2014 [39] , the use of this needle-free vaccine delivery device has increased. New biomaterials and technologies also suggest significant promise for vaccine delivery using vaccine patches (despite a long path with some notable failures [10, 40] ), which deliver vaccines through the skin using arrays of submicron projections, although no licensed vaccine patch exists to date in the US.",

If VICP SIRVA claims continue to lead to compensation on the order of around $40 million per year, then we can anticipate cumulative US spending of over $500 million on VICP SIRVA claims by 2030. Table 1 also shows that most of the SIRVA claims involve influenza vaccine delivered to adults, which suggests a significant opportunity to avoid VICP claims and pay-outs associated with elimination of influenza-related injection injuries. Recognizing the mounting costs of these injuries and that vaccine manufacturers currently lack adequate incentives to fully invest in the research and development needed for promising incremental improvements for existing vaccines and vaccine delivery methods [9] , we consider the creation of a new incentives fund for reducing future SIRVA claims. We note that while reducing injections also provide multiple additional benefits that fall outside of the VICP (e.g., eliminating occupational needle-stick injuries, reducing sharps disposal requirements that affect the health system, enabling vaccine delivery by personnel who do not need training for delivering injections, including self-administration), we ignore those likely external benefits.",

We propose, based on past experience, that the amount of the VICTF set aside to ensure the provision of payment to individuals entitled to compensation for vaccine-related adverse events could be leveled off somewhere in the range of $2 to 3 billion (i.e., nearly $1 billion held against existing claims in the system given the 2 to 3 year delay to process claims and a $1 to 2 billion reserve). Now that the fund has reached nearly $4 billion, we suggest that the amount above the necessary level could go to a fund that would be available to support the costly translational studies (i.e., Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, post-market surveillance) needed to support the commercialization of vaccine products designed to prevent potential future vaccine injuries. This could operationally occur by diverting some fraction of the inflow of new excise taxes into a newly created research and development fund that would support innovation for vaccines for which the excise taxes exist (i.e., it would preclude the use of the funds for new vaccines) and only divert the fraction that maintains the VICTF at the necessary level (i.e., accounting for the interest revenue on the fund as well). The Department of the Treasury would continue to invest the anticipated level amount of the existing VICTF, such that interest income would continue to accrue. The Department of the Treasury could similarly invest any of the funds held for this newly created innovation fund that remain unallocated. Designation of the funds to specifically address the barriers that currently exist to performance of research and development needed for the prevention of future VICP claims appears most consistent with the original intentions of the VICP. The proposed changes would use funds to provide manufacturers with incentives for improvement of existing vaccines and delivery technologies.",

In addition, any changes should not disrupt the primary function of the VICP of providing payment to individuals entitled to compensation for vaccine-related adverse events [41] . We suggest that such an incentive could lead to innovations that reduce vaccine-associated injuries and improve the safety of vaccine delivery for Americans without any net increase in taxes. We also suggest that such a mechanism could support the costly clinical trial studies that currently serve as a barrier to the advancement of vaccine delivery technologies like a vaccine patch platform [10] .",

The proposed mechanism could also potentially be used to support studies that would reduce other types of vaccine-associated injuries, although in this proposal, we suggest a modest test of the concept.

In addition, although increased demand for products leads to lower prices in normal markets (i.e., increased demand allows existing buyers to share in the benefits of lower prices that occur with economies of scale), that does not generally occur in the global vaccine market. Notably, the global vaccine market includes tiered pricing, which enables earlier adoption and greater global use of the vaccines created and licensed in developed countries into lower-income countries, by allowing the lower-income countries to purchase the vaccines at lower prices than those paid in industrialized countries [43, 44] . Tiered pricing can be accomplished by using existing production capacity for already-developed products to sell the vaccines at prices that reflect the marginal cost of production, making them affordable for developing countries who will or can only purchase at a lower price, or facilitating technology transfer from manufacturers in relatively higher-income countries to manufacturers in lower-income countries who can produce the vaccines with significantly lower production costs. However, since maintaining high prices for vaccines (and other pharmaceutical products) serve as the means for manufacturers to recover the costs of research and development in the US (as a market that values innovation), tiered pricing means that buyers in markets that support innovation do not realize the benefits of sharing these costs with buyers in other markets [11] .",

Thus, the vaccine market includes relatively high-priced vaccines targeted at relatively high-income markets (e.g., single dose, combination vaccines) and lower-priced multi-dose vaccines for relatively lower-income countries. Often a single manufacturer (or a decreasingly small number of manufacturers) serves the specific market [11, 12, 45] .

This implies development costs associated with conducting clinical trials to show safety and efficacy of the combination and non-inferiority for each component included in the combination product compared to delivery in a non-combined or lesscombined formulation.
