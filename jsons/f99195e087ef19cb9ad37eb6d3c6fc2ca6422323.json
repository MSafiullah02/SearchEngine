The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO 2020c . The disease primarily spreads via close contact of respiratory droplets generated by infected individuals (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a). At the global level, sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19 is not available as it should be and therefore preventing individuals from accessing care. During the initial outbreak period, different countries have followed and implemented various testing strategies, depending on the availability of diagnostics and consumables. However, strict steps taken by the WHO has made the diagnostic available with the mission to \"detect, protect and treat\" to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (WHO 2020d). Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can substantially reduce the number of prospective cases. Hence, laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 holds the key in containing and restricting the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, surveillance should be performed for those who were in contact with the suspected or conformed individuals by observing their clinical symptoms.

India has a wide network of laboratories for testing of viral diseases; the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDL) forms the base of the testing laboratories pyramid with an apex centre at the top of the pyramid. In these testing times, these VRDLs are taking the lead in the real-time diagnosis of COVID-19 in India. Such robust networking of laboratories can be replicated in LMICs for prompt sample collection till the final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Also the development of a serological assay at the earliest will be beneficial for resource-limited countries, and also the turnaround time will be significantly reduced. Furthermore, as the pandemic widens its arm a point of care molecular test will be like a holy grail in the rapid diagnosis of cases, thereby initiating the treatment at the earliest.",
