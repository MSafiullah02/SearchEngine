This disease often enters its late phase, dilated cardiomyopathy and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy usually progress to terminal heart failure and require heart transplantation as a last therapeutic option (Martino et al., 1994). At present, there is no specific treatment for this disease. CVB3 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus and infects host cells through a coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR)(Bergelson et al., 1997). This viral genome encodes four capsid proteins VP1-VP4 and seven nonstructural proteins including two proteases 2A and 3C, and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D. CVB3 RNA can be directly translated into a single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed mainly by viral proteases 2A and 3C to produce mature structural and nonstructural proteins for viral replication (Klump et al., 1990). Thus, viral protease 2A plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle and pathogenesis (Chau et al., 2007, Xiong et al., 2007). For this reason, viral proteases are one of the major targets for antiviral drug design.",

            "text": "Recently, the development of therapeutics for viral myocarditis has focused on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target viral mRNA to inhibit translation. siRNAs are short, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that can target a specific sequence of mRNA for degradation via a cellular process known as RNA interference (RNAi) (Dorsett and Tuschl, 2004). In this process, siRNA incorporates into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that recognizes and cleaves the target sequence (Elbashir et al., 2001). Previously, we synthesized a siRNA targeting the CVB3 protease 2A gene, which achieved 92% inhibition of CVB3 replication (Yuan et al., 2005). Although this new strategy has exciting potential, like other parallel drug developments, one of the major barriers for clinical application is the non-specific distribution of the drugs in the body after administration. In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver siRNAs to CVB3 susceptible target cells using the ligand-linked pRNA (packaging RNA) as a vehicle.",

            "text": "The pRNA, one of the six copies of the RNA components within the nanomotor of bacterial phage 29, was discovered more than 20 years ago (Guo et al., 1987); however its potential application in drug packaging and delivery attracted scientists\u2019 attention only recently. pRNA is 117 nucleotides (nts) long and has been found to play an essential role in phage DNA packaging. pRNA molecules can form dimers, trimers, and ultimately hexamer arrays through hand-in-hand interactions of the right and left interlocking loops (Guo, 2002, Guo et al., 1998). The structural features of pRNA allow for easy manipulation and permit the conversion of pRNA into a gene targeting and delivery vehicle. Since this molecule is smaller than any other presently used DNA vectors, it facilitates its cellular internalization and confers its lower immunogenicity than other large vectors. The multimer structure of pRNA complex allows it to carry both therapeutic molecules and a ligand simultaneously, which may enable it to deliver drug specifically to a target cell population (Guo, 2005). The pRNA molecule contains two independent folding domains with distinct functions. Replacement or insertion of oligonucleotides preceding nt #23 or following nt #97 does not interfere with the formation of dimers as long as the strands are paired. Therefore, the 5\u2032/3\u2032 proximate double-stranded helical region of the pRNA can be redesigned to carry additional sequences without altering its secondary structure or intermolecular interactions (Guo, 2002). Based on these characteristics, we replaced this helical region with our double stranded siRNA/2A and delivered this therapeutic molecule to the target cells via the pRNA vehicle.",

            "text": "In search of ligands guiding drug specific delivery, many molecules, such as RNA aptamers, peptides and antibodies have been tested (Guo et al., 2005, Kumar et al., 2007, Maruyama et al., 1995, Terada et al., 2006). In this study, we used folic acid as a ligand for delivery of siRNA/2A to HeLa cells, the CVB3 susceptible host cells expressing folate receptors. Folic acid is a vitamin that is essential for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and is not produced by mammalian cells. It is consumed in elevated quantities by proliferating cells and is transported across the plasma membrane using either the membrane-associated reduced folate carrier or the folate receptor (FR) (Reddy and Low, 1998). The former is found in virtually all cells; the latter is found primarily on polarized epithelial cells and activated macrophage. The reduced folate carrier is probably capable of internalizing the necessary folate in normal cells; however FR is frequently overexpressed on a wide range of tumor cells as a consequence of increased folate requirements (Lu and Low, 2002, Toffoli et al., 1997). Therefore, FR's natural ligand, folic acid, has become a popular molecule for targeting attached drugs to cancer cells. In this study, we constructed folate-labeled pRNA monomers and formed heterodimers with chimeric pRNA-siRNA/2A. One subunit of the dimer contained a folate-AMP at its 5\u2032 end, which was used for target cell recognition, and the other harbored a moiety of therapeutic siRNA/2A. By this design, we specifically delivered the pRNA-siRNA/2A by incubation rather than transfection to the HeLa cells via folate-FR interactions. These pRNA-carried siRNA/2A molecules strongly inhibited CVB3 replication and achieved an antiviral efficiency equivalent to that of the free siRNA/2A delivered by transfection, indicating that functional siRNA/2A was properly processed and released after entering the target cells. Importantly, this approach specifically delivered the drug to the target cells but not to the folate receptor negative cells, indicating its promising role in drug targeted delivery for treating cancers and infectious diseases.",

As folate has been linked to the 5\u2032 of the AMP, it can only be used for initiation but not for chain extension of transcription, thus ensuring that labeling occurs only at the 5\u2032 end of the pRNA transcript. Magnesium (10 mM) was included in all buffers to maintain the folding of pRNA and the formation of dimers.",

Complementary modification studies have revealed that altering the primary sequences of any nucleotide of the helical region of the pRNA does not affect its structure and folding as long as the two strands are base-paired (Chen et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 1995). As siRNA is a dsRNA helix, it can replace the helical region of the pRNA and is carried by the pRNA molecule. To construct these chimeric pRNA-siRNAs, a plasmid encoding the pRNA backbone sequence was constructed previously by cloning of the synthesized dsDNA fragments into a plasmid vector (Zhang et al., 1994). This plasmid was used as a template to conduct PCR to amplify cDNA fragments encoding chimeric pRNA-siRNA containing, in order, sense sequence of siRNA, a poly-A liker, pRNA sequence, a ploy-A linker and antisense sequence of the siRNA (Fig. 1B). The cDNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). In vitro transcription using these PCR-amplified cDNA fragments containing the T7 phage 2.5 promoter upstream of the insert was conducted using T7 RNA polymerase. The chimeric pRNA transcripts harboring the siRNA/2A sequences were shown in Fig. 1C. These chimeric pRNAs synthesized include (i) pRNA-siRNA/2A, a pRNA chimera that harbors an siRNA targeting the CVB3 2A protease gene, (ii) pRNA-siRNA/mut, a pRNA chimera containing a point mutation in the middle region of siRNA/2A, and (iii) pRNA-siRNA/scr, carrying a scrambled siRNA. In addition, a pRNA vector (nts 29\u201397) was also synthesized, which was used as a control. All the chimeric pRNA-siRNAs were analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE (Fig. 2B).",

Comparing with the 16:1 ratio used previously (Guo et al., 2006), transcription using the 20:1 molar ratio produced even higher yield of RNA transcripts, which required no gel purification and could be directly used for dimer formation. The RNA labeled with folate had a slower migration rate than the nonlabeled RNA on denaturing polyacrylamide gel. pRNA-siRNA/2A DNA was also used as the template for in vitro transcription in the presence of folate-AMP to generate chimeric folate-pRNA-siRNA/2A monomer. To increase the accessibility of the folate molecule to folate receptor on the cell surface, folate-labeled pRNA was designed to be a 5\u2032 overhang, in which nts 107\u2013117 of pRNA were truncated (Guo et al., 2006).

We demonstrated that pRNA-siRNA/2A achieved a similar strong anti-CVB3 activity as that of the free siRNA/2A, indicating that siRNA/2A sequences carried by pRNA can be properly folded into dsRNA helix, and processed by Dicer to release functional siRNA/2A after entering the cells. To increase the efficiency of the active siRNA/2A release from pRNA-siRNA/2A by Dicer, two additional uridines were introduced at the 3-way junction to increase the free energy for folding of the junction area into a single-stranded loop.

Construction of pRNA dimers carrying both drugs and ligands simultaneously can satisfy this goal. As our main goal is to develop a new system for siRNA specific delivery to target cells, we selected HeLa cells, a CVB3 susceptible host and a cancer cell line, to test this system. Since almost all cancer cells are folate receptor positive cells (Holm et al., 2000, Toffoli et al., 1997), we used folate as a ligand to guide the receptor binding and internalization of siRNAs. By construction of folate-labeled chimeric pRNA-siRNA/2A monomers and heterodimer complexes, we demonstrated for the first time that ligand-mediated delivery of siRNA carried by pRNA vector could successfully inhibit viral replication. In 5\u2032-labeling of the pRNA with folate, we found that the molar ratio of 5\u2032folate-AMP:ATP at 20:1 could result in high yield and increase the labeling efficiency. For assembly of heterodimer complexes with pRNA-siRNA/2A and folate-pRNA, magnesium concentration is crucial. Mg2+ at 10 mM could result in high yield of dimers, which confirmed the previous report (Guo et al., 2006). This concentration may also be important for stabilizing the dimers during delivery. Thus, how to maintain this concentration during delivery in vivo needs to be investigated.",

However, it is used for delivery of siRNAs to treat viral infections has never been reported. Our data have showed the great potential of this small RNA molecule as an effective vector for targeted delivery of antiviral drugs. This is largely attributed to its unique characteristics (Guo, 2002, Guo, 2005): besides its low immunogenicity resulted from its smaller size than any other often used viral vectors thus far, its property to spontaneously form dimers, trimers and heximer array renders its capability to carry both drugs and ligands in one multimer (Shu et al., 2003). In case that the multimer carries a combination of 3\u20136 therapeutic molecules and/or ligands, it may render a synergistic effect on gene silencing and specific targeting. More potentially, simultaneously delivering multiple therapeutic sequences may be effective for reducing mutation escape (drug resistance) of the virus. This uniqueness is a critical requirement for antiviral drug development because viruses, particularly the RNA viruses such as CVB3, HIV, SARS-CoV, and influenza virus, all have a high mutation rate. That is why the drug resistance is a major barrier for treatment of the viral infections and why it is difficult to develop effective vaccines for preventing these diseases from frequent reemerging.",

Here we used folate as a ligand for the in vitro study because the HeLa cells, an established cell line for the study of CVB3 infection, are happened to be cancer cells and express a very high level of folate receptors. As CVB3 is a primary pathogen of human myocarditis (Kim et al., 2001), we aim to delivery the drug to the heart to inhibit CVB3 replication. To date, there is no effective vector to specifically deliver therapeutics to this organ even though the AAV vector and retrovirus vector have achieved promising outcome, they are big DNA vector and have high immunogenicity (Fechner et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2008). The present study has shown promise to explore the possibility of using the small pRNA as a vehicle to transport the drug to the heart through ligand-receptor interactions. The ligands for targeting the heart are either specific myocardium-binding peptides or CVB3 receptor ligand, such as the peptides of viral capsid proteins. Currently, the search for such ligands in our laboratory is in progress.",

The double-stranded helical domain on the 5\u2032/3\u2032 ends is framed and the domain for dimer formation is shaded. (B) Schematic structures of cDNA encoding pRNA vector and chimeric pRNA-siRNA. The DNA contains a T7 phage 2.5 promoter followed by the chimeric pRNA-siRNA/2A sequence as indicated on the diagram. The cDNA encoding the pRNA (29\u201391) lacks the nts of 5\u2032 1\u201328 and 3\u2032 92\u2013117, which are replaced by sense and antisense siRNA/2A, respectively. Poly-A linkers are used to link the siRNA/2A and the pRNA sequence. (C) Folate-labeled chimeric pRNA heterodimer complex harboring siRNA/2A. The 21-mer siRNA/2A marked by a frame is covalently linked to the 5\u2032/3\u2032(29/91) paired ends of pRNA connecting by poly-U linkers. The poly-U linkers are used to facilitate folding of the chimeric pRNA-siRNA/2A and enhance the processing by Dicer to release functional siRNA/2As. The ligand folate is covalently linked to the 5\u2032end of pRNA. To increase the accessibility of the folate to its receptor, folate-labeled RNA is designed to be a 5\u2032overhang, in which nts 107\u2013117 at the 3\u2032end of pRNA are truncated. The dimer is formed by hand-in-hand connections between the left- and right-hand loops. Curved lines indicate the base-pairing between two loops (a\u2032-A and B-b\u2032) of chimeric pRNA monomers.",
