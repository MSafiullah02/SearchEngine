When in an environment containing this potential hazard, both surgical masks (SM) and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) have been used by the general public as well as health care workers. While the superior filtration and fit characteristics of N95 FFR over surgical masks have been demonstrated in laboratory and workplace studies with inert (non-biological) particles, their superiority in reducing disease transmission in clinical/field settings is still questioned by some members of the health care/infection control industry. Attempts to study the relative efficacy of the two devices in the field using clinical outcomes have yielded inconclusive results because of limitations in experimental design and implementation.",

No study to date has been conducted in a manner that would allow the performance of the two types of devices to be differentiated. In particular, study subjects failing to wear the assigned device during all times of potential exposure, along with a lack of continuous observation of subjects\u2019 use, compromise the superior protection the N95 FFR can provide. Additionally, the lack of formalized, complete respiratory protection programs negates the superior filtration and fit characteristics of the N95 FFR. As has been shown in industrial workplaces, one may reasonably expect that N95 FFR will effectively reduce health care workers\u2019 inhalation exposures to airborne biological agents when complete, effective respiratory programs are in place. Because voluntary users and the general public will not likely use respirators under the guidance of a formal program, the benefit of respirator use alone is likely to be minimal.",

The filters ranged from approximately 10% to 96% efficiency under the NIOSH test conditions; only one SM met the NIOSH minimum requirement for filter efficiency. This finding was consistent with research done by NIOSH, which also found a wide range of filtration performance for SM tested at the NIOSH filtration test conditions.(18) Furthermore, quantitative fit tests conducted by Oberg and Brosseau resulted in only two acceptable fits out of 40 trials. Consequently, small particles are likely to enter the wearer's breathing zone via both the SM itself (poor filtration) and the gaps between the SM and the skin of the face (poor fit). As such, SM cannot be expected to significantly reduce the inhalation of infectious aerosols.",

            "text": "Aerosol transmission of biological particles is only one of several routes of exposure for some diseases for which respiratory protection may be used. Recent field studies(26,27) suggested that long-range transmission of influenza is possible via aerosols in the respirable size range. Additionally, investigations of disease outbreaks(28,29) suggest proximity to the index (first) case as a major factor in respiratory disease transmission. This may indicate increased inhalation exposure to small particles, and/or transmission of a virus (e.g., influenza) by particles >100 \u03bcm (droplets, sprays) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is traditionally believed that droplet spray transmission occurs only within a radius of approximately \u223c3 feet from the infected person, although recent recommendations have suggested that 6 to 10 feet may be prudent for emerging or highly virulent pathogens.(2) Transmission of some viruses may occur by touching contaminated surfaces or objects with the hands and subsequently touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Exposure of unprotected eyes to airborne viruses may also contribute to infection.(19) Importantly, the relative contribution of each mode of transmission is not clear for many diseases.(30,31)",

This means there is no assurance that the device under evaluation was tested with a sufficient concentration of airborne infectious agents, or how much the device was able to reduce the inhaled exposure. In contrast, workplace studies of FFR performance against inert hazards use Co and Ci measurements to define the device's efficacy: the calculated Co:Ci ratio represents performance, i.e., how much the FFR reduces exposure and is called the workplace protection factor (WPF).(34\u201339) For contaminants with exposure limits, FFR performance is adequate when Ci measurements are below that limit. While Co:Ci ratios for biological contaminants may not be convenient (or even feasible) to measure at this time, they would provide reasonable estimates of the actual exposure reduction provided by the devices in use.",

Several recent studies illustrate this and other deficiencies that make it impossible to judge the performance of a properly used respiratory device:\n\u2022Loeb et al.(3) found no statistically significant difference in influenza infection rates of HCW wearing either a fit tested N95 FFR or an SM. Subject compliance (wear) rates were not known, as only periodic audits of device usage were done. In addition, use of gloves, gowns, and hand washing were not monitored, and the possibility of community exposure to influenza was acknowledged.\u2022Another study of the efficacy of SM and N95 FFR (both fit tested and not fit tested) in HCW found respiratory illness/influenza infection rates in workers in either FFR group were roughly half the rate of those wearing SM.(22) Interestingly, both groups of FFR performed equivalently, i.e., fit testing showed no beneficial effect. While laboratory studies show that FFR are expected to provide more protection from inhaled aerosols than SM, it is not certain that they were actually responsible for the lower infection rates in the two groups who wore them. First, the authors defined compliance as wearing the device as \u226580% of the work shift, and 68\u201376% of subjects were said to comply (Figure 1). Compliance was determined by head nurses\u2019 observations and subjects\u2019 self-reporting. Additionally, the devices were evaluated in different groups of hospitals, and no air samples were taken to ensure exposures were equivalent for all the groups. Again, it is plausible that exposures and behaviors (including non-compliance) at individual sites were dissimilar and could account for the differences in infection rates.\u2022Studies of health care facilities that used both N95 FFR and SM for workers potentially exposed to H1N1 influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been reported by Seto et al.(4) and Ang et al.,(45) respectively. The Seto study also included unspecified \u201cpaper masks.\u201d The two investigations suggested that both FFR and SM controlled infection, but the \u201cpaper masks\u201d in the Seto et al. study did not. However, both studies were retrospective and relied on participants\u2019 self-reporting on the use of the devices, other PPE, and hand washing. As such, no valid conclusions regarding the performance of a properly used FFR or SM can be drawn.\u2022Community studies using SM and N95 FFR (or a European P2 FFR) on influenza patients and/or household members have also been conducted.(20,21,23,24) In some cases, hand washing was used as an additional intervention. Because these studies typically describe subject-reported compliance rates of \u223c50%, they are of essentially no value for assessing respiratory device performance.",

Although many laboratory studies in controlled environments using manikins and human subjects exist, there have been no properly designed field studies to assess the ability of FFR and SM to reduce disease transmission rates. The difficulty of conducting such studies is compounded by lack of exposure limits, knowledge of an inhaled infectious dose, multiple exposure venues, and the interactions of several interventions used simultaneously. Current studies(50) may properly address these difficulties, but it is unlikely a true FFR or SM clinical efficacy study will be completed in the near future. Thus, their role in reducing disease transmission must be based on inference and laboratory studies for the time being.",

A recent study by Nichol et al.(52) concluded that adherence to the use of FFR in a health care setting could be improved with the ready availability of equipment, training and fit testing, organizational support for worker health and safety, and good communication practices. These recommendations are consistent with the elements of an effective respiratory protection program described by 1910.134. It is likely that facilities that implement these practices will achieve FFR performance equivalent to that shown in industrial studies. If particle inhalation is a significant route of exposure for that aerosol, FFR are far more likely to reduce infection via this route than are SM.",

Unlike health care workplaces, members of the general public or casual (voluntary) workplace users will not have identified where and when exposures to infectious aerosols might occur; it is therefore likely that FFR would not be in use when an exposure does occur. Secondly, the benefits of individual fit testing have been well documented,(34\u201338, 53,54) and general public FFR users generally do not make the effort to be fit tested properly. Thus, these users may or may not achieve meaningful inhalation exposure reduction, even if the FFR is properly donned during an exposure episode. These limitations hold for all FFR, including those cleared by the FDA as N95/surgical masks or for general public use.(55)",
