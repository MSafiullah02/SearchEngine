Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and 31 preventative options are undertaken all over the world. 32 Objectives: We summarised all registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention 33 options for COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved studies. 34 Data sources: Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union 35 Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched. 36 Study eligibility criteria: Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention 37 options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were 38 applied. We excluded withdrawn or cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or 39 preventative strategies for COVID-19.",

Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated. Interventional trials were 45 methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional 46 Chinese Medicine. 47 Results: In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing 48 preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved. Finally, 214 studies were 49 methodologically reviewed. Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 50 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 51 40-200). Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed. 52 4 Conclusion: Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 53",

The host's type II transmembrane serine 228 protease (TMPRSS2) facilitates membrane fusion and augments viral internalization by 229 cleaving and activating the S-protein [56,57]. These proteins, being an integral part of the 230 viral life cycle, can be used as possible therapeutic targets. 231 Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition conceivably ameliorates the over-accumulation of 232 angiotensin II induced by the down-regulation of ACE2, as noted in other CoV infections; 233 therefore, the inhibition of RAS system may be protective against the development of 234 fulminant myocarditis and ARDS [58]. Currently, 2 randomised controlled trials testing 235 losartan are ongoing in the USA. 236 Camostat mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor, inhibiting the TMPRSS2 and is 237 approved for chronic pancreatitis [59]. Umifenovir is a small indole derivative with a broad-238 spectrum antiviral activity developed about 30 years ago [60,61]. Although it is currently used 239 in Russia and China to combat influenza, it has shown in vitro activity against numerous 240 DNA and RNA viruses including SARS-CoV [60,62,63]. It primarily targets the interaction 241 between viral capsid and the membrane of the host cell by inhibiting the attachment, the 242 fusion and the internalization of the virus [60]. Moreover, umifenovir has direct virucidal 243 effects against enveloped viruses through interaction with the viral lipid envelope or with key 244 residues within structural proteins of virions [60,63,64]. Limited data support that umifenovir 245 may exhibit immunomodulatory effects by stimulating hosts' humoral immune response, 246 interferon production, and phagocytes' activation [65]. A small retrospective study in China 247 demonstrated some promising results regarding its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 when 248 used in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir [66].

However, repurposing of existing drugs is a viable and less time-consuming 365 alternative; licensed broad-spectrum antiviral agents with a well-documented safety profile 366 are currently tested against SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, screening of chemical compounds' 367 libraries may be useful in the discovery of an efficacious treatment against COVID-19 disease 368[84]. In this review, we have summarised and methodologically appraised the ongoing 369 therapeutic and preventive trials for COVID-19.370 Therapeutic strategies should follow the two-phased immune response to COVID-19. 371 Initially, treatment should aim at strengthening the host's immune response against the virus, 372 and inhibiting the viral replication [85]. Early initiation of antiviral therapy has been proved 373 beneficial for the prognosis of patients [86]. As advanced age correlates with higher viral 374 loads, older patients could strongly benefit from the prompt initiation of antivirals[87]. 375 Moreover, high inflammatory cytokine levels have been correlated with disease severity and 376 the extent of lung damage [88]. Thus, in the later phase of the infection, patients could be 377 availed by anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches such as the Janus kinase inhibitors, 378 blood purification or tocilizumab [89,90]. 379 Prevention is a key player in combating pandemics. The mRNA 1273 vaccine, is currently in 380 phase I, but is not expected to be commercially available this year [91]. The prophylactic 381 potential of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine is also actively being examined among 382 healthcare professionals [92]. Moreover, prompt testing and isolation are of utmost 383 importance for disease prevention. At the moment, real-time quantitative polymerase chain 384 reaction is the reference standard in diagnostics [93]. The FDA has recently announced the 385 authorisation of rapid molecular tests that are capable of delivering results within minutes, 386 thus facilitating early treatment initiation (when viral loads are highest) and timely isolation 387 [87,94,95]. 388 Based on the retrieved data, cell therapies and hydroxychloroquine were the most frequently 389 evaluated candidate therapies (25 and 22 trials respectively), while remdesivir was associated 390 with the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial (453, IQR 397-650). Although 391 TCMs and homeopathy represent a large proportion of the identified interventional studies, 392we excluded them from our methodological analysis as we do not have the expertise to 393",

The use of clinical and uniform primary endpoints should be 404 encouraged in an infection where the association between the clinical status and viral 405clearance, radiological or immunological evolution is obscure. 406Our study underlines the need to meticulously register as many study details as possible on 407 international registries during outbreaks, in order to guide the development and enhance the 408consistency of future trials. Reporting as much detail as possible is instrumental in having 409 consistent clinical trials and enhancing the reproducibility of the results, especially as studies 410 are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions, and composite or weak 411 outcomes that can limit the treatments' efficacy assessment. That is why transparency and 412 consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by 413 conducting, for example, meta-analyses. 414 The development of clinical trials during an outbreak is an adaptive process and new evidence 415 emerges at an impressive rate. A review of the early registered clinical trials is an important 416 asset for researchers and methodologists alike. These results might encourage transparency 417 when developing and registering future clinical trials and help improve their methodology, 418 hence the robustness of their results. 419 Conflict of interest: For YY: Chair of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious 422 Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the coordinator of REsearch and ACTion targeting 423 emerging infectious diseases (REACTing). 424 For CS: Consultancy and research funding, Hycor Biomedical and Thermo Fisher Scientific; 425 Consultancy, Bencard Allergie; Research Funding, Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN). 426 Supported by Universities Giessen and Marburg Lung Centre (UGMLC), the German Centre 427 for Lung Research (DZL), University Hospital Giessen and Marburg (UKGM) research 428 funding according to article 2, section 3 cooperation agreement, and the Deutsche 429 Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)-funded-SFB 1021 (C04), -KFO 309 (P10), and SK 317/1-1 430 (Project number 428518790).
