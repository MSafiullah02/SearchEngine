(1) Since a complete telemedicine program can't be created overnight, we faced the fact that it hasn't been a priority at our public hospitals to strengthen telemedical innovations. As such, we had to develop health informatics tools for the attention of patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 as the pandemic developed.",

The physician has the opportunity to ask any further information needed and, if necessary, explain the swabbing procedure (Figure 1-B) . Afterwards the doctor calls one of his or her peers that is waiting fully dressed in PPE at another room to discuss the goals of the next encounter: swabbing, prescribing, assessing for more detailed physical examination signs. Thereby, the exposure of the healthcare worker (HCW) in PPE to the potentially infected patient, and vice versa, is ideally reduced to a minimum.",

(1) In our case, adapting this system came at little to no cost since the software used was free to access and use. This raises the question to whether such platforms comply with ethics and local general data protection regulation. Since the transmission of the data is encrypted by the software used, these authors' opinion is that the potential benefits in the current pandemic outweigh the recognized risks for a system that can't allow the privilege to outsource telehealth systems. What may normally seem as a disadvantage in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of strict billing and regulatory laws play as an advantage in COVID-19 times when it comes to telehealth regulation.",

This was facilitated by the fact that most of the current smartphones only require for the camera app to point to at a QR in order to access the link. Out of the 1009 patients cared in this model, 874 (86.6%) completed the task successfully. Fifty patients from the database were randomly selected and were asked to answer an e-mail satisfaction survey in which 90% felt like they had enough time with their doctor to solve their doubts and 80% reported that it was easy to use and fill the QR based survey. The latter is consistent with the conclusions of a systematic review where self-administered questionnaire responses collected using smart devices might improve data completeness, acceptability, and time taken to complete over paper surveys. (3) Even though we live in a middle-income country, we have adequate infrastructure to stablish the mentioned strategies, this may not be the case for all the hospitals in developing countries and certainly not to the least developed countries. Despite the fact that we didn't achieve scripted triaging as with novel electronic health records,(4) it's these author's opinion that we may have accomplished electronic check-in, real-time data analysis, and telemedicine capabilities. We share our model so that it may encourage others to adapt technologies according to their resources. ",
