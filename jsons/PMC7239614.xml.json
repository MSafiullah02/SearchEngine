However, in addition to acute issues such as the outbreak of infectious diseases, challenging phenomena such as chronic diseases have threatened that positivity. Responding fully to these diseases will not be possible by relying solely on the sciences. Because caring for the health of mankind is the essence of medicine, the prevention of disease is in itself a social process, requiring human love that is blind to national borders. In addition, a diverse range of work in critical medical humanities has long explored the realities of medicine and health. Therefore, reflection on the nature of medicine, with special attention to the economic, social, cultural, anthropological, and historical causes of disease, is essential for reshaping medical education for the 21st century. Although these topics have been introduced into medical humanities curricula, pragmatically focused medical education systems concentrate on immediate clinical results rather than critical reflection. In many medical schools around the world, the medical humanities have thus become enclaves against the dominance of biological sciences.",

Since 2009, along with expansions in the provision of health care and technical advances, the Chinese government has vigorously promoted various policies and guidelines aimed at improving physicians' training standards and working environments, including raising their incomes and reforming medical humanities curricula.",

Bethune emphasised that a person's motivations should be guided by principles, not profits, and he effectively brought modern medicine to rural China. His selfless attitude left a profound impression on the Chinese people, and Bethune's spirit to this day remains at the core of a Chinese medical humanities education.9\n",

Eight course types were identified. The most frequently offered course types are medical psychology or clinical psychology (72 [77%] of 94 schools who publicise their curricula), medical ethics (68 [72%]), hygienic and medical jurisprudence (57 [61%]), and doctor\u2013patient communication (46 [49%]). Medical humanities courses account for 3\u201310% of the total credits that students are required to obtain in order to graduate, and the compulsory ideological and political theory curriculum accounts for 6\u20138% of the credits required to graduate. This curriculum includes Mao Zedong thought, modern Chinese history, Marxism, socialism with Chinese characteristics, and moral education and law, and it is required of all students, not solely medical students.",
