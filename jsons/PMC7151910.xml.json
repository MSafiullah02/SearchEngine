Here, estrogens can induce thymic atrophy (Staples et al., 1999), increase the generation of mature CD4+ T cells (Tanriverdi et al., 2003), and their emigration (Pido-Lopez et al., 2001). One striking estrogen-mediated feature is the concentration-dependent effect on CD4+ T helper (Th) cell polarization: low concentrations of estrogens are paralleled by Th1 cell proliferation, cell-mediated immunity, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 as well as antibody production (Pennell et al., 2012; Pernis, 2007). This response is of rather proinflammatory nature and accompanied by increased cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) activity (White et al., 1997). Conversely, high-estrogen concentrations increase interleukin (IL)-4 production by Th2 cells, which induce humoral immunity and have an anti-inflammatory effect (Karpuzoglu and Zouali, 2011; Pennell et al., 2012; Pernis, 2007; Straub, 2007). High levels furthermore expand regulatory T (Treg) cells (Arruvito et al., 2007; Fish, 2008; Polanczyk et al., 2004), accompanied by an increased expression of IL-10 and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Luo et al., 2011), inhibitory costimulatory molecule programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 (Wang et al., 2009), and cell death\u2013mediating perforin (Valor et al., 2011).",

Further, progesterone antagonizes the effect of estrogens on T cell cycle progression and apoptosis (McMurray et al., 2001) and inhibits proliferation of T cells after DC stimulation (Butts et al., 2007) and their differentiation into proinflammatory Th17 cells (Lee et al., 2011). Most importantly, the high concentrations of progesterone present during pregnancy inhibit a Th1 bias of the immune response by stimulating the generation of Treg cells (Lee et al., 2011) and anti-inflammatory, IL-4- and IL-10-secreting CD4+ Th2 cells (Correale et al., 1998; Miyaura and Iwata, 2002; Szekeres-Bartho et al., 1996).

Testosterone inhibits Th1 differentiation (Kissick et al., 2014), IFN-\u03b3 secretion in NKT cells (Lotter et al., 2013), and parasite-induced Th2 responses (Hepworth et al., 2010). In turn, it enhances Th2 immunity to counteract overshooting Th1 responses in autoimmunity (Dalal et al., 1997) and induces expansion of suppressor CD8+ cells (Olsen and Kovacs, 1996; Tanriverdi et al., 2003) and Tregs (Fijak et al., 2011; Page et al., 2006). B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production are reduced in response to androgens (Chang et al., 2013; Ellis et al., 2001; Smithson et al., 1998).",

Also, GCs inhibit DC maturation and antigen-presenting function (Elftman et al., 2007; Franchimont, 2004; Hunzeker et al., 2011), thereby locking DCs in a tolerogenic state (Bros et al., 2007; Luther et al., 2009). With regard to the adaptive immune response, GCs reduce the levels of circulating na\u00efve T cells (Besedovsky et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2013) and trigger T cell apoptosis (Purton et al., 2004). They suppress CD8 T cell activation, proliferation, and trafficking (Hunzeker et al., 2011) and reduce NKT cell number and cytotoxic activity (De Lorenzo et al., 2015). GCs suppress cellular (Th1) immunity by repressing production and release of Th1 and Th17 proinflammatory cytokines (Franchimont, 2004) and favor humoral (Th2) immunity (Miyaura and Iwata, 2002; Van Den Brandt et al., 2007). In turn, the differentiation of IL-10-producing Tregs is promoted (Chen et al., 2006). B cells are repressed by GCs (Youinou and Pers, 2010; Zen et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Most of the described immune\u2013endocrine effects described above and depicted in Figure 4 are compiled from observations in different species, cell subsets from different organs, from distinct disease models, or from in vitro experiments. Hence, it is difficult to appreciate the biological consequences of these cross talks between hormones and immune cells. Epidemiological observations greatly facilitate understanding of the implications of immune\u2013endocrine interaction for health and disease (Figures 1 and 3). Here, the more readily initiated innate immune response to pathogens and a more efficient antigen presentation seen in females could be attributed to the predominance of estrogens (Gubbels Bupp, 2015; Klein et al., 2010a), which promotes the response to infections, vaccination, and trauma with a stronger adaptive response of Th1 cell\u2013mediated immunity, along with Th2-triggered humoral immune responses (Gubbels Bupp, 2015; Klein et al., 2010a). Females also exhibit higher immunoglobulin levels both at baseline and following infection or immunization, which promotes the elimination of viral pathogens (Ackerman, 2006; Furman et al., 2014). This health advantage related to immunity has significant collateral disadvantages, mirrored by the increased risk for autoimmunity in women. Here, the estrogen-induced promotion of T cell and B cell lymphopoiesis has been proposed to promote the escape from negative selection, hereby leading to the presence of autoreactive cells (Fish, 2008; Jeganathan et al., 2014; Okuyama et al., 1992). The autoreactive cells can subsequently contribute to the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Cutolo et al., 2003), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Costenbader et al., 2007), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (Fish, 2008), or multiple sclerosis (MS) (Voskuhl and Gold, 2012).",

Indeed, testosterone has been shown to decrease the number of autoantibodies (Tanriverdi et al., 2003) by inhibiting the expansion of autoreactive B cell clones (Altuwaijri et al., 2009). In accordance with this, declining levels of testosterone increase the risk for autoimmune diseases in males. Conversely, the testosterone-mediated immunosuppression also explains the increased viral persistence seen in men (Klein et al., 2012). Chronic immune diseases including atherosclerosis and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, are also more prevalent among men. This health disadvantage has been attributed to the lack of estrogens, which can protect against vascular injury and atherosclerosis and regulate metabolic pathways (Gubbels Bupp, 2015). Another potential disadvantage related to immune\u2013endocrine interaction is the overall higher risk of adult men to develop cancer, which has been linked to the testosterone-related dampened immune responses to neoplasms (Trigunaite et al., 2015).",

Indeed, female- and male-aged individuals show higher-serum levels of a proinflammatory cytokines, which has been termed inflammaging (Bartlett et al., 2012; Vural et al., 2006; Yasui et al., 2007). Despite this inflammatory status, aging is characterized by a less-efficient innate defense against pathogens (Shaw et al., 2013; Solana et al., 2012) and a decreased functionality of the adaptive immune response (Hirokawa et al., 2013; Sasaki et al., 2011; Schenkein et al., 2008; Strindhall et al., 2013). Treg cells and differentiated T cells with memory and effector functions accumulate in the periphery (Haynes and Maue, 2009; Yan et al., 2010), which has been proposed to render the aged individual less flexible to fight novel pathogens and could explain the reduced vaccination efficacy in the aged of both sexes (Giefing-Kroll et al., 2015). Studies on sex-specific differences in immunosenescence are sparse, but the reduced levels of testosterone could allow for the increased occurrence of autoimmune diseases seen in aging males, while the decrease in estrogens reduces autoantibody-driven autoimmunity in females, while at the same time enhancing T cell\u2013mediated autoimmune diseases (Straub, 2007). Future studies are needed to elucidate immune\u2013endocrine mechanisms modulating the course of infectious diseases and vaccination efficacy in the elderly.",

This cellular influx is increasingly facilitated with progressive formation of new vasculature and accumulation of chemokines and peaks at the time of ovulation, possibly to provide a receptive environment for blastocyst implantation (Wira et al., 2015). During ovulation, estrogens induce immunoglobulin secretion to facilitate removal of potential pathogens (Kutteh et al., 1996; Wira et al., 2005; Beagley and Gockel, 2003). Moreover, the increased number of Treg cells in the endometrium throughout the proliferative phase until ovulation points toward their possible role in promoting local immune tolerance to facilitate blastocyst implantation (Arruvito et al., 2007; Berbic et al., 2010).",

This is accompanied by low-antibody levels in cervical secretions (Schumacher, 1973). At the same time, the endometrium prepares for a possible blastocyst implantation via an increase of uterine NK cells. These NK cells show a unique phenotype, as they exhibit low-cytotoxic activity (Evans and Salamonsen, 2012). Additionally, endometrial CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity is suppressed (Laskarin et al., 1999). Surprisingly, after peaking around ovulation, Treg cell numbers decrease at the beginning of the secretory phase, which challenges their central role in contributing to persisting immune tolerance during very early pregnancy (Arruvito et al., 2007; Berbic et al., 2010).",

Studies performed in mice reveal a reduced protection from bacterial infection in the genital tract in response to progesterone (Kaushic et al., 1998). Also, viral infection appeared to be enhanced in dioestrus (corresponding to the secretory phase with high progesterone levels in humans), while viral replication was reduced during the estrogen-dominated preovulatory phase (Gallichan and Rosenthal, 1996). Hence, a window for increased susceptibility to STIs, for example, HIV, has been proposed for the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle due to the suppression of innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity by progesterone and high estrogens (Saba et al., 2013; Wira and Fahey, 2008; Hafner et al., 2013). In conclusion, immunity in the female reproductive tract faces a contradictory demand by suppressing an immune response against allogeneic sperm antigens and promoting the implantation of a semiallogeneic blastocyst. This is at the expense of immunity against local pathogen challenges.",

The constantly rising levels of progesterone and the enhanced GC production in response to HPA-axis activation could increase the susceptibility to or severity of infectious diseases due to the suppression of a proper immune response necessary to control and eliminate pathogens (Tait et al., 2008). In pregnant mice, infection with Leishmania major, Salmonella enterica, and Toxoplasma gondii is more severe due to the suppressed Th1 immunity that would usually mount an antiparasitic response (Krishnan et al., 2013). Pregnant women are at an increased risk to suffer from acute and chronic viral infections such as rhinovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, varicella zoster, hepatitis E/B, HIV, and cytomegalovirus (Harger et al., 2002; McDonagh et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2003). Moreover, pregnant women are highly susceptible to influenza A virus infection, mirrored by the high incidence, morbidity, and mortality, as last observed by during the 2009 pandemic (Jamieson et al., 2009; Klein et al., 2010b). This has been described to result from the contradictory demand for the immune system to mount a virus-specific immune response to clear the influenza infection, while simultaneously maintaining adaptation to pregnancy (Gabriel and Arck, 2014). Furthermore, antibody-mediated disorders such as SLE (Smyth et al., 2010), sclerodermia (Artlett et al., 1998), and thyroiditis (Klintschar et al., 2001) are exacerbated during pregnancy, possibly due to enhanced antibody production in response to the high levels of estrogens.",

In female patients with MS or RA, both T cell\u2013mediated inflammatory diseases, clinical symptoms have been reported to improve during pregnancy. This is followed by vigorous disease relapses shortly after parturition, when hormonal levels and immune adaptation are being restored to nonpregnancy levels (Confavreux et al., 1998; De Man et al., 2008; Hughes and Choubey, 2014). Strikingly, the amelioration of MS disease activity has been shown to exceed the effect size of currently available therapeutic strategies (Vukusic et al., 2004). Hence, a better understanding of underlying immune\u2013endocrine pathways may provide insights for developing new treatments for these conditions (Patas et al., 2013).",

Investigations also aim to understand the genetic influence of the sex chromosomes on immune differences between the sexes. It has been proposed that the escape from X chromosome silencing and X inactivation skewing may reactivate parts of the second X chromosome in females, which could promote female immune function due to enhanced expression of immune-regulatory genes. Males, in contrast, have only one copy of the X chromosome which encodes for many genes involved in immunity (Libert et al., 2010). Also gender-related lifestyle factors may contribute to differential immunity and disease susceptibility (Oertelt-Prigione, 2012).",
