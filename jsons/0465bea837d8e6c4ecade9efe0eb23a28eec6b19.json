Despite incomplete and rapidly evolving evidence, we offer early guidance without formal recommendations and evidence grades because urgent changes are necessary. This guidance is based on expert opinion and early shared experiences with reorganizing stroke systems at the time of writing (April 13, 2020). This document is guided by two main principles. First, stroke remains a medical emergency and should be treated as such. Second, stroke care is highly effective. Stroke best practice recommendations remain as evidence-based and relevant as ever, even though logistics and workflows need to change to accommodate the pandemic. Evidence-based stroke care reduces mortality, length of stay, improves functional outcomes, and prevents recurrence, contributing to relief of the health system. [8] [9] [10] It should not be intentionally stopped or suspended, and this is universally agreed upon by stroke leaders (Appendix 1 in Supplementary material).",

            "text": "Acute stroke activations pose a risk because the stroke team must come in close contact with patients from the community, many of whom will have uncertain COVID-19 status. Patients unable to answer COVID-19 screening questions due to aphasia, cognitive issues, or encephalopathy should be treated as suspected COVID-19 positive. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn, in accordance with local policies. Guidance for a \"protected code stroke pathway\" has been offered, emphasizing screening, appropriate use of PPE, where each team member understands their specific role, to minimize potential COVID-19 exposure. 1, 4 Telemedicine can be used for acute stroke consultation to avoid exposing team members and reduce use of PPE. Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a highly effective stroke treatment indicated for severely affected ischemic stroke patients at risk for respiratory instability, vomiting, aspiration, and coughing, all of which could increase spread of viral-laden droplets. To avoid the risk of emergency intubation in the EVT angiography suite with potential viral spread, it is appropriate to make early decisions regarding the need for intubation. If needed, it should be done in an elective, controlled manner prior to transfer to the angiography suite in a negative pressure room. This does not imply the need to intubate more patients, and we continue to recommend that monitored anaesthesia is preferred unless there is a clinical indication for intubation. 5 Similarly, recent multisociety guidance agrees that intubation is not necessary for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. 11, 12 The minimum possible sedation should be used in COVID-19 suspected patients, to reduce the risk that bag-mask ventilation, an aerosol-generating procedure, would be required. 11 Demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds may exceed supply during the surge of COVID-19 patients. It is appropriate to consider predicted stroke-related mortality as one of the criteria for ICU admission. However, many patients with stroke, including hemorrhagic stroke, can be saved with intensive care and will have a lower expected mortality than similar-aged COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. As recommended by ethicists, decisions on triage should be based on objective evidence for mortality risk without making presumptions about quality of life for stroke survivors. 13 Triage for ICU admission should be made only after attempting emergency procedures to reverse the patient's condition, including intravenous thrombolysis and EVT for acute ischemic stroke and treatment of hydrocephalus in hemorrhagic stroke patients.",

All interdisciplinary staff should also receive basic stroke education on assessment for signs and symptoms of stroke as part of monitoring for possible stroke transformation.
