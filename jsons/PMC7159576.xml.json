For instance, although animal mortality is now considered the most crucial indicator of welfare level (Sato 1997; Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare 2001), it was traditionally investigated on farms as an important indicator of management quality. The caretaking activities of capable farmers are considered to keep mortality rates low in all seasons.",

Mortality in the cattle industry is not only relevant with regard to animal health and welfare but also to economic losses.",

Therefore, for instance, the UK Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Cattle (DEFRA 2003) states that \u2018Ideally calves should be left with their dam for at least 12 and preferably 24 h after birth \u2026Allowing the calf to suckle naturally may be the best way to make sure that it gets enough colostrum.\u2019 In spite of this, it is reported that a significant proportion of dairy calves suffer from failure of passive transfer (FPT) of antibodies from colostrum (Godden 2008). For instance, 30\u201340% of dairy calves are estimated to suffer from FPT even when they were left with their dams for 12 to 26 h following birth (Brignole & Stott 1980).",

Calves with FPT also suffer from a possibility of poor productivity that lasts until the first lactation in dairy heifers (Robison et al. 1988; DeNise et al. 1989) and the feed lot in beef cattle (Wittum & Perino 1995). It includes relatively higher morbidity and mortality rates, lower daily weight gain during the pre\u2010 and post\u2010weaning periods, and lower milk production during the first lactation.",

Cows suffering from various infections produce lower levels of colostral immunoglobulins and a higher calf mortality rate (Dardillat et al. 1978). In addition, many factors, including the timing of colostrum ingestion, method and volume of colostrum administration, and immunoglobulin concentration in the colostrum ingested have been implicated in immunoglobulin absorption by suckling in calves (Weaver et al. 2000). In cases where there are suspicions of possible FPT, prophylactic administration of freeze or spray\u2010dried colostrum just after a calf is born efficaciously increases blood immunoglobulins (Fukushima et al. 2004). Additionally, the nutrition of a dam in the periparturient period can play a vital role in the early development of immunity in a neonate (Wilde 2009).",

The mortality rate is considerably lower on farms where the owner takes care of his/her calves him/herself than on farms where employees perform these duties (Martin et al. 1975b). Calf mortality rate tends to increase with increasing herd size (Gulliksen et al. 2009). On some farms, an increase in the number of calves born each year seems to be related to a concomitant increase in calf deaths (Martin et al. 1975b). Other farm factors concerning calving site and calf housing do not seem to be related to calf mortality rate (Martin et al. 1975b).",

In general, calf mortality rate is higher in winter than in summer (Wittum et al. 1990; Bendali et al. 1999; Gulliksen et al. 2009). Increases in the mortality rate in winter would be closely related to cold, wet, windy weather (Martin et al. 1975c). These climatic conditions are especially severe for dystocial calves because they have a lower basal metabolic rate and heat production (Vermorel et al. 1983; Wittum et al. 1990). Heat stress in summer can reduce calf resistance to disease as a result of increased corticoid levels, inhibiting immunoglobulin absorption from colostrum (Wiersma et al. 1976).",

Furthermore, calf mortality within 24 h of birth increases as the severity of dystocia increases (Nix et al. 1998; Tarr\u00e9s et al. 2005). Even in calves from normal parturitions, the mortality is higher in bull calves than in heifer calves (Nix et al. 1998). Yet this is the opposite of the buffalo previously described. The risk of death is greatest during the first week of life, accounting for more than half of all deaths (Martin et al. 1975a). However, the mortality rate of calves 5 weeks old and over decreases significantly (Martin et al. 1975a; Rogers et al. 1985). Apart from the neonatal period, it is demonstrated that dairy calves fed nonsaleable pasteurized milk have a higher growth rate and lower morbidity and mortality rates than do calves fed commercial milk replacer until they are weaned (Godden et al. 2005).",

Although the direct cause of calf death is infectious diseases such as acute neonatal diarrhea, the morbidity and mortality from the disease increases in the presence of physical and psychological stressors in the calf\u2010rearing environment. This suggests that a calf should be treated with the utmost care and attention even concerning the above secondary influencing factors. In addition to protection by passive immunization and preventive vaccinations for infectious diseases, environmental quality improvement should be performed from the point of view of not only animal welfare but also increasing productivity.",
