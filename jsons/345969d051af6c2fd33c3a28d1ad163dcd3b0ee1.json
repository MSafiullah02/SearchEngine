An heuristic search 11 approach was used where 3.77 million individuals with Singaporean citizenship or permanent resident status 12 were created using the three primary attributes; age group, ethnicity and gender. The remaining attributes for 13 each individual were drawn randomly from the attribute's marginal distributions. Summary tables equivalent to 14 the census tables were calculated and the fit compared via Pearson's chi-squared statistic. Zero count cells were 15 avoided by setting them to 0.1.
