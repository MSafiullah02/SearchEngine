Nurses who did possess some rudimentary knowledge likely served in the military, worked as prehospital providers, were employed in a hospital emergency department, or participated in humanitarian disaster relief work. Consequently, most nurses graduating from schools before 2001 have wide gaps in their knowledge of disaster care.",

Nurses comprise the largest number of health care workers, but many nurses are unprepared to respond because of lack of knowledge or skills. These existing deficits create a nursing workforce requiring additional hours of formal instruction to be able to respond effectively in the event of a high-impact incident resulting in mass casualties. It is accepted that all practicing nurses should possess a basic understanding and skill set to be able to provide care in the event of a mass casualty event [3]. These educational demands are staggering, particularly in a health care environment already operating at or above capacity. Innovative ways to educate nurses and other health professionals are being instituted. At least three national CE courses targeting physicians, dentists, paramedics, and nurses were created and are now offered nationally under the sponsorship of the American Medical Association [4]. Patterned on the basic and advanced life support course model, these courses and have three levels: core disaster life support (CDLS), basic disaster life support (BDLS) and advanced disaster life support (ADLS). These programs, however, may be unavailable in more rural locations. Additionally, they can be costly, and many nurses cannot get paid time off work to attend the courses.",

            "text": "Computer-based training, a strategy used in many fields of study, is another newer alternative for practicing nurses to augment their disaster training. On-line training has been purported to be more efficacious, more convenient and more flexible, because it can be completed at the learner's own time and pace [5]. These electronic resources typically include on-line, learn at one's own pace modules [5], and many are offered free of charge. Upon completion of many of these computer modules, the learner can print a certificate to show proof of training. A basic review of nurses' responsibilities during disasters is sponsored jointly by the American Red Cross and Sigma Theta Tau International, but this on-line course provides very basic information and should be considered a starting point for further more in-depth education (http://www.nursingsociety.org/education/case_studies/cases/SP0004.htmlwww.nursingsociety.org). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offer excellent information on chemical, biological, and radiological emergencies, and the information can be accessed easily from the CDC Web site. Two nursing groups, the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE; as of spring 2007 changed to Nursing Emergency Preparedness Education Coalition, NEPEC) and the National Nurse Emergency Preparedness Initiative (NNEPI), are excellent sources of computer links for many of these Web-based training modules relevant for nurses.",

            "text": "Although numerous computer-based training modules for health professionals exist, most of these on-line educational offerings do not specifically target nurses. With funding from the Agency for Healthcare and Quality (AHRQ), Elizabeth Weiner was one of the first individuals to spearhead the development of six disaster education modules specific for nurses [5]. All the modules were developed and centered on the core competencies for practicing nurses identified by INCMCE/NEPEC. Access to these free modules is obtained at the INCMCE Web site (www.incmce.org). Another recent computer-based initiative specifically for nurses is under construction by NNEPI (www.nnepi.org) and funded by the US Department of Homeland Security. Similar to the INCMCE/NEPEC modules, the NNEPI on-line program consists of six modules taking about 6 hours to complete. These free modules are nearing completion, and it is anticipated that they will be available on-line in the near future. Another innovative CE program of study can be accessed on-line at St. Louis University (http://nursing.slu.edu/cne_disaster_prep_home.html). Completion of this nurse-focused CE program provides a certificate in disaster preparedness. Nurses desiring to obtain a certificate are required to pay a fee and must complete six required and four elective modules (from a list of 12). Many other on-line disaster training programs not specifically targeted to nurses are widely available, and both NEPEC and NNEPI have links to the Web sites.",

            "text": "Although the need to educate nurses in the fundamentals of disaster care is recognized, and great strides have been made, nursing school curriculum in the United States for the most part remains inadequate [6]. Weiner and colleagues [6] showed that as late as 2003, the number of hours focused on the nurse's role in disaster preparedness in American schools of nursing had increased marginally, but continued to be inadequate. They identified several important obstacles for this including: curricula already heavily content laden, lack of scholarly articles targeted for nurses, inadequately defined and validated fundamental content, and faculty insufficiently prepared to teach the content [5]. Nevertheless, some university-based schools of nursing are attempting to integrate disaster nursing content throughout the curriculum, often as part of community health course content, or as electives for students to choose [7], [8], [9]. For example, the Long Island University School of Nursing involves senior nursing students in a 3-hour lecture covering basic disaster management principles and a 1-day symposium as part of their community health experience [10]. Another school, the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Nursing, had nursing students participate in a simulated mass causality drill to allow students an opportunity to practice skills [11]. The question remains, however, how much and what type of content is sufficient? Jennings-Sanders and colleagues [9] suggest that short lectures do not provide enough time to synthesize disaster nursing principles. Consequently, they propose that disaster nursing should be a required semester-long course for undergraduate nursing students. This may be very difficult to achieve, because most undergraduate curricula are content-overloaded.",

To date, some anecdotal evidence exists to support the efficacy of bioterrorism and disaster preparedness courses [8], [10], but a systematic analysis of relevant curricular threads has yet to be completed. This emphasizes that core content for nursing curriculum needs to continue to be delineated and that outcome competencies must be identified and then validated through research. Creation of such a framework then can guide curriculum organization and design. One of the major impediments in the establishment of such a framework is the fact that essential content for disaster nursing education remains poorly characterized; however, preliminary work on competencies is well underway.",

The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires measurement of competency in its accreditation process [24]. In January 2001, JCAHO introduced new emergency management standards, building on its long-standing disaster preparedness requirements [24].

Consequently, the dynamic nature of preparedness makes precise identification of basic educational priorities specific for nurses difficult at best. Nevertheless, since 2001, progress has been made. Existing literature reflects five general elements important for nurses, and several authors suggest that these should be incorporated into curricula [8], [33], [34]. These educational priorities include: detection and reporting of unusual outbreaks, treatment of ill and injured, control measure implementation, resources and preparedness planning, and management of the public. Interestingly, a landmark study of Wisconsin nurses identified at least eight similar educational priorities for nurses dealing with disasters and other large health care emergencies [1]. Unsurprisingly, the top three priorities dealt with nurses' knowledge of: 1) triage and first aid, 2) detection of symptoms associated with biological agent-caused diseases, and 3) accessing critical resources such as the strategic national stockpile. Other areas where nurses felt undereducated were the incident command system, quarantine, decontamination, psychological first aid, epidemiology, clinical decision-making, and communications/connectivity [1].",

The Jennings-Saunders disaster management model highlights four phases that nurses in the community may use to plan disaster nursing care [35]. Each phase focuses on different aspects of disaster planning and response. While the phase 1 (predisaster) targets planning for disaster and resource allocation, phase 2 (disaster) addresses nurses' role in the midst of a disaster. Phases 3 and 4 of the model deal with health need evaluation and effects of the disaster on patient or population health, respectively [35]. In Veenema's early ground-breaking text, the author uses the typical disaster model phases of preimpact, impact, and postimpact to describe model nursing roles specific for each phase of the disaster [36]. Most recently, Wynd proposed a model for disaster military nursing [37], incorporating elements of both the Jennings and the Veenema models [35], [36]. Wynd's model, like Veenema's, focuses on military nursing activities involving preparedness and readiness (phase 1); on impact/response and implementation (phase 2); and finally on postimpact recovery, reconstruction, and re-evaluation (phase 3).",

Several schools of nursing recognize the need for graduate education and to that end have created masters degree programs and post-masters certificates in emergency planning and disaster response [39]. The University of Rochester (New York) was the first school of nursing to create a masters program to educate nurses as leaders in disaster response and emergency preparedness [39]. The program focuses on the development of skills leaders need to design, implement, and evaluate programs dealing with emergency response and disaster management. Another trendsetter was the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHUSON, Baltimore), which in fall 2005 inaugurated what is believed to be the first nursing graduate program geared toward the preparation of nurse leaders in emergency response and disaster management in health care facilities. The masters track was established on the belief that nurses always have held key positions in health care facilities, that they possess valuable insider knowledge of how health care facilities function during disasters, and that they hold pivotal roles in the formulation of institutional disaster management plans. Students are required to complete courses on health systems management, education, national/international humanitarian relief, emergency planning, and disaster response (a series of three). A 12 credit post-masters certificate is also available. Concurrent to the initiation of the JHUSON masters program, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville also launched a nursing masters degree and post-masters certificate option in homeland security nursing. Students may opt to focus their studies on management or on advanced practice/clinical nurse specialist roles. The post-masters option requires completion of 24 credits. Adelphi University (Garden City, Long Island, N. Y.) recently started a masters/post-masters degree in emergency nursing and disaster management. Other university schools of nursing offer masters track subspecialty options or post-masters certificates, including Columbia University and University of Pittsburg (\nTable 1). As more university schools of nursing expand their masters options to include specialty tracks in emergency response and disaster preparedness, it is likely that graduates will assume groundbreaking new roles as health care leaders, emergency planners, biopreparedness coordinators, and educators.",

Heightened understanding of all the components of emergency preparedness education ensures that the range of preincident actions and processes are: standardized and consistent with mutually agreed upon doctrine and measurable, resulting in integrated emergency preparedness education. Additionally, there should be training exercises incorporating nationally formulated core competencies across all responder/receiver roles. Once this preliminary work is completed, more attention needs to be devoted to rigorous scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of existing emergency preparedness education programs. In addition, systems of metrics to detail capacity and performance must be created. These have significant implications for the future development of educational programs in this area. Although it is virtually impossible to completely prepare every nurse to respond to all types of large-scale health crises, it is possible to identify comprehensive emergency preparedness principles that can provide a framework for university curriculum, CE programs, and just-in-time training, thus creating a nursing workforce better equipped to respond when disasters do strike.",
