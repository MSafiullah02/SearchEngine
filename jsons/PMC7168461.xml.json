            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis worldwide, posing a global burden estimated in 2005 at 119 million infections of which 31 million resulted in symptomatic illness and 34,000 in death.1 The virus is transmitted faeco\u2010orally, mainly through close contact with infected individuals or by consumption of contaminated food and drinking water. The extreme environmental stability of the HAV particle contributes significantly to its transmission.2, 3 HAV epidemiology correlates with poor hygiene and living conditions. Consequently, virtually every adult in developing countries is seropositive due to childhood infection. On the contrary, in regions with improved hygiene standards, infection is often postponed to later age. In addition, disease severity is generally age\u2010dependent: infections are usually mild or asymptomatic in young children, whereas at older age, hepatitis A frequently presents with classic symptoms of acute hepatitis (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, general malaise, etc.) and a higher incidence of fulminant hepatitis, which may require liver transplantation.4 Fulminant hepatitis occurs especially in those aged over 50 for which mortality rates up to 5.4% have been reported.5 Additionally, HAV superinfections in chronic liver disease patients (e.g., hepatitis B or C) are believed to increase morbidity and mortality,6, 7, 8 although these findings are still subject to debate.9 Since highly efficient vaccines that provide long\u2010lasting immunity have become available, HAV mortality and morbidity has decreased dramatically.8, 10 However, occasional outbreaks of hepatitis A, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes, still occur in industrialized countries. For instance, in the last decade, outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of contaminated green onions, semidried tomatoes, seafood, such as raw oysters and sushi, and other foodstuffs.11, 12, 13, 14\n",

For instance, it has been suggested that TIM\u20103 promotes HAV entry without being a functional receptor.25 In addition, HAV\u2010specific IgA are reported to mediate infection of hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR).26 This and the fact that IgA was also identified as a natural ligand for HAVcr\u2010127 may explain why (and how) IgA\u2010coated HAV can enter the hepatocytes through both HAVcr\u20101 and ASGPR, thereby promoting enterohepatic circulation and continuous (endogenous) reinfections of the liver.28 This phenomenon is thought to play an essential role in prolonged and relapsing cases of hepatitis A. Only the emergence of avid IgG antibodies can break the cycle and eventually clear the infection.28\n",

Upon binding to its receptor the particle is destabilized, thus initiating the uncoating process and releasing the single\u2010stranded RNA into the host cell cytoplasm.33 Uncoating has been reported to be a slow and asynchronous process with a reported duration of 4\u201310 hr, in contrast to under an hour for poliovirus.34 It has been proposed that this asynchronicity may be due to the fact that the HAV inoculum contains a heterogeneous mixture of mature virions and provirions. These provirions still require a maturation cleavage (of VP0 into VP2 and VP4, as discussed below) following entry, prior to uncoating, and might therefore uncoat more slowly than mature virions.34, 35 During the uncoating process, dense, noninfectious HAV uncoating intermediates are formed. Intriguingly, these particles do not appear to have an altered sedimentation profile, thereby differing from the typical picornaviral A particle.36 Finally, both low pH and Ca2+ ions are reported to play an important role in HAV receptor binding, uncoating and during the maturation cleavage of provirions following virus entry (as described above).31, 32, 35, 37 Upon completion of uncoating, the single\u2010stranded RNA is released into the host cell by an unknown mechanism.",

Similar to other picornaviruses, HAV employs an IRES, located in the 5\u2032 UTR, to direct cap\u2010independent translation of the viral genome using the host ribosomal machinery. Most picornaviruses affect the host cell protein synthesis to favor a more efficient translation of the viral mRNA. This process is mediated by a proteolytic cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), thereby inducing a complete shutdown of capped mRNA translation.38 Intriguingly, unlike for other picornaviruses, it is thought that HAV IRES depends on eIF4G, as part of an intact eIF4F complex.39 The fact that HAV has to compete with an intact host cell machinery may also explain its poor replication in cell culture (see Section 5.). However, a recent publication by Redondo et al. suggested that HAV IRES\u2010driven translation can occur without intact eIF4G and that another factor may be crucial for this translation.38\n",

Following the initial cleavage at the 2A/2B junction by 3Cpro (as discussed above), the N\u2010terminal part of protein 2A coordinates proper folding of the P1\u20132A precursor protein. This precursor protein is then processed by 3Cpro and its stable precursor 3ABCpro into VP0 (consisting of VP4 and VP2), pX precursor (consisting of VP1 and 2A), and mature VP3 protein.42, 56 These building blocks assemble into pentamers and subsequently associate with viral RNA to form preprovirions. In a final processing step, VP0 will be cleaved into VP4 and VP2 and precursor pX into VP1 and 2A, yielding mature virus particles with only VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins. The processing of pX is mediated by a yet unknown cellular protease.57 Although the cleavage can be performed by extracellular enzymes like factor Xa and trypsin,58, 59 maturation can also be executed by the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin L. This may indicate a role for lysosomal proteinases in maturation cleavage and potential targeting of HAV provirions to the early lysosomes for maturation cleavage.59 On the other hand, VP0 processing is thought to be a self\u2010catalytic process that is dependent on the presence of encapsidated RNA.60 The resulting VP4 is rather small compared to other picornaviruses and lacks an N\u2010terminal myristoylation signal.61 Note that the mature VP4 protein has never been identified in purified virus stocks and its role in capsid formation remains unclear.15, 60\n",

Despite the fact that the exact details of HAV release remain elusive, the mechanism seems to differ depending on the cell type infected and is thought to involve either a vesicle\u2010mediated cellular protein transport pathway or specialized hepatocellular transport proteins involved in bile secretion.62 Blank and colleagues demonstrated that following infection of polarized human intestinal epithelial Caco\u20102 cells, release of progeny virus was largely restricted to the apical membrane.62 In this way, virus is secreted mainly into the intestinal lumen resulting in an amplification of the HAV inoculum in the intestines and thus an increased viral shedding and spreading of the virus. However, it is still unclear by which mechanism HAV reaches the blood stream. A role for transcytosis by M cells present in Peyer's patches in the ileum has been suggested, a mechanism that was found for poliovirus and reovirus as well.62 Another study described that infection of polarized human hepatocytes occurred most efficiently via the basolateral plasma membrane, after which more than 95% of progeny virus was exported through the basolateral membrane (into the bloodstream), rather than through the apical membrane (into the bile channels).63 This contrasts with the in vivo observation that bile and faecal titers are considerably higher than serum titers.15, 64 Reuptake and transcytosis of progeny virus by the hepatocytes into the bile channels is suggested as the mechanism for enteric secretion.",

This process is optimal at acidic pH, but is impaired at physiological pH. This suggests that HAV has evolved to escape erythrocyte binding and consequent clearance.67, 68 Indeed, a mutant of this binding site displayed increased clearance from the blood and lower overall fitness, suggesting evolutionary constraints and explaining the low level of antigenic variability of the glycophorin A binding site.68\n",

HAV was shown to inhibit double\u2010stranded RNA (ds RNA)\u2010induced IFN\u03b2 gene expression70 by interfering with the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) and melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA\u20105) signaling pathways (Fig. 2).71 RIG\u2010I recognizes single\u2010stranded 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate RNA, while MDA\u20105 detects single\u2010 and double\u2010stranded picornaviral RNA covalently linked to VPg.72 Both RIG\u2010I and MDA\u20105 use an adaptor protein called mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS\u20101, VISA, or Cardif) that is localized on the outer membrane of the mitochondria.50 Upon activation by RIG\u2010I or MDA\u20105, MAVS recruits and activates TANK\u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5). TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are both responsible for the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF\u20103), eventually leading to IRF\u20103 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and induction of IFN\u03b2 transcription. HAV proteins 3ABCpro\n50 and 2B72 have been described to interfere with MAVS, thereby disrupting the innate cellular antiviral defense mechanism. Precursor protein 3ABC is a stable polyprotein processing intermediate that requires both the 3A and the 3Cpro domain for the cleavage and inactivation of MAVS. The transmembrane domain of protein 3A ascertains mitochondrial localization while the 3Cpro catalytic site performs the actual proteolytic cleavage of MAVS. Mere 3Cpro, lacking the 3A domain, is incapable to perform this proteolysis.50 In addition, it has been demonstrated that protein 2B suppressed both MAVS functioning and the kinase activities of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, thus synergistically suppressing RIG\u2010I/MDA\u20105 signaling, although the exact mechanism still remains to be elucidated.72\n",

            "text": "A second immune evasion strategy employed by HAV can be found in its codon bias or nonuniform usage of codons during translation.76 Due to the lack of mechanisms to induce cellular shut off, HAV has to compete with host mRNA for translation (as described above). Within this context, HAV has strategically adopted a codon bias toward rare codons, resulting in a highly deoptimized coding usage.77, 78 This phenomenon contributes considerably to the low replication efficiency of HAV in several ways and seems to serve multiple purposes: first, the deoptimized codon use may reflect a strategy by which rare tRNAs are preferred over abundant tRNAs thereby avoiding competition with cellular tRNAs in the absence of an adequate host cell translation shut off.77 Second, due to a decreased translation and replication rate, the virus is capable of keeping the cellular amount of dsRNA to a minimum, thus escaping the host cell antiviral response.78 In addition, CpG\u2010containing codons are particularly suppressed in the HAV coding sequence.79, 80 This particular codon deoptimization is proposed to be associated with the recognition of unmethylated CpG by the innate immunity as a pathogen marker, contrary to the methylated CpG pairs of the host. Also in this way, HAV can evade the attention of the immune system. Third, the use of rare codons, usually grouped in clusters, is important for translation kinetics as such cluster may lead to a transient translation stop, a phenomenon known as ribosome stalling.81 It has been suggested that this transient stop may be an important prerequisite for proper folding of HAV structural proteins thereby contributing to the low antigenic variability and extreme environmental stability of HAV.77, 78, 82 Consequently, when HAV is adapted to replicate in vitro under circumstances of chemically induced cellular shut off, the resulting strains (with a \u201cre\u2010deoptimized\u201d coding sequence) display reduced environmental stability.83 Given the preference of HAV for reduced RNA replication and translation levels, it is now comprehensible why HAV would employ such inefficient type III IRES84, 85: a very efficient IRES would not be compatible with escaping innate immunity and with the many ribosome stalls during translation.83\n",
