Loss of Sia production can cause the developmental of defects and lethality in most animals; hence, animal cells are less prone to evolution of resistance to interactions by rapidly evolved Sia-binding viruses. Obligative intracellular viruses mostly have rapid evolution that allows escape from host immunity, leading to an epidemic variant, and that allows emergence of a novel strain, occasionally leading to pandemics that cause healthsocial-economic problems. Recently, much attention has been given to the mutual recognition systems via sialosugar chains between viruses and their host cells and there has been rapid growth of the research field \"sialoglycovirology.\" In this chapter, the structural diversity of sialoglycoconjugates is overviewed, and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that bind to Sia are reviewed. Also, interactions of viral lectins-host Sia receptors, which determine viral transmission, host range, and pathogenesis, are presented. The future direction of new therapeutic routes targeting viral lectins, development of easy-to-use detection methods for diagnosis and monitoring changes in virus binding specificity, and challenges in the development of suitable viruses to use in virus-based therapies for genetic disorders and cancer are discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "One of the greatest discoveries in medical sciences is the discovery of sialic acid in the mid-1930s to mid-1980s. The Swedish chemist Blix separated the polyhydroxy acid part from a disaccharide crystalline compound isolated in 1936 from a boiling water solution of bovine submaxillary mucin of salivary glands and proposed in 1952 that it be internationally called \"sialic acid (Sia)\" (the Greek root sialos \u00bc saliva) [1] . The German biochemist Klenk purified brain glycolipid from ganglion cells, neurons in brain gray matter, and called it \"ganglioside\" [2] , and he called an acidic crystal from methanolysis cleaving the glycosidic linkages of the ganglioside \"neuraminic acid (Neu) \" in 1941 [2] . The German biochemist Gottschalk found a water-soluble, nitrogen-containing compound released from ovomucin/human urinary mucoprotein after incubation with V. cholerae/influenza A or B virus and reported it to be \"N-substituted isoglucosamine\" in 1951 [3] . The pathogen enzyme that releases this monosaccharide was named receptordestroying enzyme (RDE) according to its activity by Burnet and Stone in 1947. Later, the name \"sialidase\" was proposed by Heimer and Meyer in 1956 [4] , and the name \"neuraminidase (NA)\" was proposed by Blix, Gottschalk, and Klenk in 1957 [5] . Finally, it appeared that a characteristic building block of Sia, N-substituted isoglucosamine, and other compounds found in the 1950s, such as hemataminic acid from a hematoside glycolipid of equine blood stroma in 1951 [6] and lactaminic acid from cow colostrum in 1954 [7] , is identical to Neu, which is 5-amino-3,5-dideoxy-Dglycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (9-carbon \u03b1-keto acids, C 9 H 17 N 1 O 8 ). In 1986, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (C 9 H 16 O 9 ), which is not Neu but a deaminated Neu, was isolated from rainbow trout egg polysialoglycoprotein and named \"ketodeoxynonulosonic (KDN)\" [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 423, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 559, "end": 562, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 684, "end": 689, "text": "(Neu)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 700, "end": 703, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 958, "end": 961, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1187, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1279, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1506, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1906, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently, Sia (Fig. 1a) is used as the generic name for a family of acidic sugars derived from 9-carbon backbone derivatives of Neu and KDN.

The parasitic relationship between hosts and pathogens drives the coevolutionary arms race between hosts and pathogens, resulting in diversity of Sias. For example, humans have evolved a mechanism to inactivate the gene encoding CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase, which converts CMP-Neu5Ac into CMP-Neu5Gc in other mammalian cells. In normal adult human cells, Neu5Gc is found less than 0.1% of total Sias from dietary intake [21] , and loss of Neu5Gc production appears to render human cells resistant to some pathogen infections, such as infections with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K99 [22] and the malaria parasite Plasmodium The parent molecule, Neu, contains a substituent R5 being an amino group at C5. N-Acylation of the 5-amino group gives 5-N-acetyl-Neu (Neu5Ac) and hydroxylation of the 5-N-acetyl group gives 5-N-glycolyl-Neu (Neu5Gc). Deamination of the amino group at C5 of Neu gives 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (KDN). These four cores differing at the C5-position can carry one or more O-substituents of the hydroxyl groups with acetyl group(s) at C4, C7, C8, and/or C9 and less often a lactyl group at C9, a sulfate group at C8, or a methyl group at C8. Also, the C1 carboxylate group can react with a hydroxyl group or with the C5 amino group forming a lactone or a lactam, respectively, and free Sias with unsaturated and anhydro forms can also be found. (c) The C2 of Sia can form several types of glycosidic linkages with the penultimate sugar. Only three major linkages, Sia\u03b12-3Gal, Sia\u03b12-6Gal, and Sia\u03b12-8Sia, are shown here. (d) Sialoglycans can be linear or branched (antennae). (e) Based on biomolecules under sugars, surface sialoglycans used for virus infection are classified into sialoglycoproteins and gangliosides (one or more Sia-containing glycosphingolipids). Sialoglycoproteins can be further classified on the basis of their covalent linkage to a protein through an Asn or a Ser/Thr into N-glycans or O-glycans, respectively.

Besides Neu5Gc, evasion of pathogens by evolutionary suppression of the expression of the other major Sia, Neu5Ac, which is critical in several endogenous functions [20] , seems to be unfavorable. Abolishing Neu5Ac production in mice by inactivation of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (GNE), a key enzyme of Neu5Ac biosynthesis, results in early embryonic lethality [25] . Mutations of the GNE gene in humans can result in impaired sialyl (Neu5Ac) O-glycan formation in sarcolemmal glycoproteins, a mechanism explaining a muscular disease called distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles [26] . Several viruses cause important diseases in humans and livestock that affect health and have large social and economic burdens, whereas some viruses are useful for therapeutic applications. Being obligate intracellular parasites, viruses must invade and take over the host cellular machinery for survival and multiplication. To be successful in life, viruses must pass through three important stages, (1) entry, (2) gene expression and genome replication, and (3) exit, as shown in Fig. 2 . The entry stage is not only critical for survival and continuation of their life cycle but also contributes to virus transmission and pathogenesis. This stage requires specific interactions between viral capsid proteins of non-enveloped viruses or viral spike glycoproteins of enveloped viruses and specific receptor molecules on the host cell surface (viral attachment). This chapter focuses on Sia-binding viruses. The characteristics of Sia-viral lectin interactions are described and the design and development of viral detection/antiviral drugs/virus-based therapies are discussed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1042, "text": "K99 [22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4426, "end": 4430, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4598, "end": 4602, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4794, "end": 4798, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5011, "end": 5015, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5500, "end": 5506, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The ability of a virus to bind to Sias can be determined via (1) a simple hemagglutination test by incubation of the virus and Sia-rich erythrocytes and observation of erythrocyte agglutination (hemagglutination) by the naked eye. To confirm that Sias or O-acetyl Sias are required for virus binding, (2) a virus-Sia-binding inhibition test can be performed by (2-1) the use of erythrocytes pretreated with an NA enzyme from a bacterium or a virus, which cleaves terminal Sia residues, or the use of Sia-deficient cell lines such as CHO-Lec2 cells. Specific binding of a virus to O-acetyl Sias can be checked by the use of erythrocytes pretreated with O-acetyl esterase from a virus such as bovine coronavirus or influenza C virus, which cleaves O-acetyl groups on Sia residues. (2-2) Hemagglutination inhibition can be performed by using a Sia-containing compound, such as fetuin, as a competitor. To reveal roles of Sia type, linkage type, sequence, compositions, chain lengths, and architectures in binding specificity of viruses/viral lectins, (3) direct binding of viruses/viral lectins to a variety of defined structures of sialyl glycopolymers coated on microplates or printed on microarray slides can be determined by quantitative detection. The detection can be The entry stage involves attachment of a virus particle to host cell surface receptors, penetration (by fusion of the viral envelope with the host plasma membrane or with the host endosomal membrane and by permeabilization of the plasma membrane (still under debate [93] )/by permeabilization/lysis of the endosomal membrane/by an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for non-enveloped viruses) and uncoating that releases the viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol. (II) The next stage is viral gene expression and genome replication. DNA viruses, except for poxviruses with a large genome having their own RNA and DNA polymerases, transcribe and replicate their genomes within the nucleus by using host polymerases. In contrast, RNA viruses, which have their own enzymes for transcription and replication, transcribe and replicate their genomes within the cytoplasm. Except for orthomyxoviruses, which need the host 5 0 cap for viral mRNA synthesis, and hepatitis D virus (HDV), which lacks both enzymes for transcription and replication, they transcribe and replicate their genomes within the nucleus. (III) Finally, the exit step occurs after viral components are assembled to form progeny viruses and ultimately released from the cell. The enveloped membrane of enveloped viruses is derived from budding, either through an internal compartment followed by exit via a secretory pathway or through the plasma membrane giving direct exit. For non-enveloped viruses, the primary mode of exit is cell lysis, and for nonlytic viral spread, the non-enveloped viruses are released from cells via extracellular vesicles [193, 194] performed by several methods such as measurement of the intensity of fluorescence products from viral NA enzyme activity [27] and measurement of fluorescently labeled antiviral/antiviral lectin antibodies or fluorescently labeled viruses/viral lectins [28] that correlate with the number of glycan-bound viruses/viral lectins.

Each genus contains only one species. Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) in the genus Isavirus causes a systemic and lethal disease in farmed and wild salmonids, whereas influenza A, B, C, and D viruses in the genera Influenzavirus A, B, C, and D, respectively, cause influenza, a contagious respiratory disease, with differences in severity and host range as shown in Table 1 . ISAV, which separately encodes hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and fusion (F) glycoproteins separately, initiates viral attachment to terminal 4-O-acetyl-sialyl glycans via HE-F complexes. This attachment mediates dissociation of HE and F, and the virus is endocytosed into the host cell [30] . Influenza C and D viruses encode hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoproteins responsible for receptor binding, receptor destroying, and membrane fusion [31] .

Unlike the viruses in Orthomyxoviridae that fuse their envelope with the host endosomal membrane, these viruses have a non-segmented (\u00c0)ssRNA genome that is released into the host cytosol via direct fusion on the host plasma membrane [57] . These viruses have undissociated binding-and destroying-receptor molecules (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, HN) that trigger fusion activity of F proteins upon binding to sialic acid-containing receptors. HNs of hPIV-1 and hPIV-3 have been demonstrated to carry two Sia-binding sites. Results obtained by computer modeling analysis and glycan array assays suggested that binding-catalytic site I of hPIV-1 prefers \u03b12-3-sialyl-Le x and binding site II of hPIV-1 prefers a sulfated \u03b12-3-sialyl-Le x and \u03b12-8Sia [50] , in agreement with the results of an earlier study showing that hPIV-1 preferentially binds to \u03b12-3Neu5Ac linked to branched LacNAc [48] . Crystallographic studies on the hPIV-3 HN complexed with Neu5Ac revealed that site I with both receptor binding and NA activities is located on the globular head HN, whereas site II with receptor binding activity is near the hPIV-3 HN dimer interface and is thought to be involved in promotion of virus fusion [58] . Direct receptor binding assays showed that hPIV-3 can bind to \u03b12-3Neu5Ac, \u03b12-6Neu5Ac, and \u03b12-3Neu5Gc receptors [48] , suggesting flexibility of the binding pockets of hPIV-3 HN. Similar to hPIV-3 binding preference, hPIV-2 was shown to bind and cleave both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6Neu5Ac ligands on a glycan array [49] . However, hPIV-1 (often) and hPIV-2 (less frequently detected) cause laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) in children, whereas hPIV-3 causes pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants [48] . Studies on receptor binding and pathological observations have suggested that these viruses might target different cell types in the same and different regions of the human respiratory system. Thus, further analysis of virus cell type binding specificity and sialoglycoconjugates in the human respiratory system for each age group is needed. Unlike the targets of the above-described respiratory viruses, mumps virus primarily infects the parotid and other salivary glands and sometimes spreads to other tissues and organs including the pancreas, testis, ovary, mammary glands, and kidney. Co-crystal structural analysis (Fig. 3b) and glycan-binding assays revealed that mumps virus HN proteins prefer \u03b12-3Sia linked to unbranched sugar chains [51] .

It has been shown to bind to linear and branched sialosylpolylactosamine (sialyl-poly-Lac-NAc) sequences in erythroglycan II on erythrocyte membranes [53] and gangliosides including I-active and i-active gangliosides with terminal Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc ( Fig. 1 ) coated on asialoerythrocytes [52] .

Exposure to a large amount of the virus is necessary for human infection, which typically causes mild conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms. NDV mainly infects domestic poultry and causes a range of diseases from nonapparent to severe respiratory/gastrointestinal/nervous system diseases depending on the virus strain. With a neurovirulent strain infection, infected poultry would develop pneumonitis followed by encephalitis, leading to severe economic effects on poultry production; hence, NDV is sometimes called avian pneumoencephalitis [61, 62] . Based on laboratory tests of their virulence (mean death time) in chicken embryos after allantoic inoculation, NDVs are divided into three groups: velogenic (most virulent), mesogenic (mid-virulent), and lentogenic (non-virulent). While velogenic strains cause economic loss, lentogenic strains are used for vaccination of chickens and for oncolytic virotherapy [62] . Understanding NDV attachment to its receptors and the viral entry mechanism is critical to find a way to control virus infection: inhibition of chicken infection by velogenic strains but enhancement of entry of a lentogenic strain into tumor cells. An early study showed that NDV prefers \u03b12-3Sia with either Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc-paragloboside gangliosides containing linear lacto-series type 2 oligosaccharide and ganglioside GM3 with either NeuAc or NeuGc [52] . Recent advances in the Sia-protein co-crystal technique [55] and hemadsorption/fusion deficiency of dimer interface mutants [63] have revealed that NDV HN carries two Sia-binding active sites. Site I possesses receptor binding mediating NA activity and triggers HN interaction with the F protein, while site II has only receptor binding activity at the dimer interface that has been proposed to maintain virus-host Sia attachment during fusion. Molecular modeling of NDV HN with small molecules and analysis of the binding free energy of interactions [56] indicated that site I prefers \u03b12-3sialyllactose. Site II can interact with \u03b12-3-sialyllactose similar to \u03b12-6-sialyllactose, but the interaction is much weaker than the interaction of site I with \u03b12-3-sialyllactose. It is interesting that binding of NDV to red blood cells was inhibited by \u03b12-3-sialyllactose but was increased in the presence of zanamivir (an NA inhibitor) preferential to bind to site I [56] . This raises important questions about whether NA activity is required for NDV NH binding and/or fusion and whether site II works independently or must be activated by site I binding to some compound such as zanamivir but not \u03b12-3-sialyllactose.

These viruses use spike (S) glycoprotein as a multifunctional molecule: its S1 subunit binds to a receptor, and its S2 subunit contains the fusion peptide (FP) that fuses viral and host membranes after activation by proteolytic cleavage. Fusion of these viruses occurs at the endosomal membrane, but Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) mainly fuses its viral membrane at the plasma membrane since its S proteins are sensitive to be activated by both the pH-dependent endosomal protease and host secreted or surface proteases [70] .

Variants with the HE gene, which have become circulating strains, could be explained by the finding that the HE protein increases the efficiency of production of infectious virus [78] possibly by acting as a lectin for enhancing viral binding and as an enzyme that destroys receptors by de-O-acetylation (esterase) for enhancing release of trapped virions from the host mucosa and of budding virions from infected cells.

The HE proteins of human toroviruses were shown to have 74% sequence identity with those of bovine toroviruses [79] , but there is a lack of information regarding receptor/substrate preferences. These receptor-binding and substrate-cleaving specificities of HE proteins in a host indicated that if the virus jumps to infect different animal species, its HE proteins need to acquire mutations to bind/cleave O-acetylated Sias expressed on the host target.

ERAV has been shown to require Sia on the host cell surface for its infection: reduction of the virus infection into host cells was observed when sialidase-treated cells were used or when \u03b12-3-sialyllactose was added to be a competitive receptor for binding to the virus. \u03b12-3 Sialyllactose was found to bind in VP1 of the ERAV capsid by X-ray crystallography, and the residues including Gln65, Ala118, Gln120, and Arg129 that interact with Sia are conserved across all ERAV strains, implying that all strains of ERAV require Sia as a receptor for virus entry [83] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 192, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 193, "end": 198, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 199, "end": 204, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 205, "end": 210, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 211, "end": 216, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 217, "end": 222, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 223, "end": 228, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 229, "end": 234, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 881, "end": 885, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 927, "end": 931, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1168, "text": "[87,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1487, "text": "[84,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1491, "text": "93]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1677, "text": "[93,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1681, "text": "94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2572, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 26, "end": 33, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 490, "end": 497, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 707, "end": 714, "text": "Fig. 3d", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Picornaviridae"}, {"text": "Investigation of the role of Sia in infections by six EV-D68 strains isolated from patients during the period from 2009 to 2010 in comparison with the prototype Fermon strain isolated more than 50 years ago showed that Sia-deficient cells and sialidase-treated cells were resistant to infections by strains 670 (clade A), 2042 510 Nongluk Sriwilaijaroen and Yasuo Suzuki (clade B), and 2284 (clade C) as in the case of the Fermon strain [89] but were sensitive to infections by the other three strains, 947 (clade B), 1348 (clade A), and 742 (clade A), and can thus be classified as Sia-dependent and Sia-independent strains, respectively [95] .

This shared \u03b12-3Neu5Ac-binding preference could be a factor explaining why these viruses have overlapping cellular tropism. Binding to and infection of conjunctival cells by both AHC-causing human picornaviruses, EV70 and CVA24v, must be further investigated. In contrast to EV70, analysis of the crystal structures of CVA24v in complex with a range of sialyl glycans indicated that CVA24v binds strongly to 6 0 SL and DSLNT (Fig. 3d) ; binds weakly to LSTc, sialyl-Le x , 3 0 SL, and 3 0 SLN (Fig. 1) ; and does not bind to GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, and GD3, suggesting that CVA24v can bind to both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6Neu5Ac with preference for 6 0 SL over 3 0 SL and 6 0 SL over LSTc structures and confirming that it does not bind to gangliosides [90] .

The EMCV K2 strain agglutinated human and equine erythrocytes dominant in Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, respectively, but did not agglutinate bovine erythrocytes dominant in Neu5Gc; hence, this selective agglutination needs to be further investigated [100] . Investigation of an EMCV receptor on permissive human cells revealed that the K2 strain uses a 70-kDa sialoglycoprotein(s) on HeLa and K562 cells as a cell surface receptor for virus attachment [101] . For the rat strain 1086C, the parental virus is not a Sia-binding virus [87] . The viruses, which were cultured in baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells, produced two groups of variants. Group I with Lys231 in VP1 that becomes Sia-dependent can bind to and infect primary human cardiomyocytes more efficiently than can group II with Arg231 in VP1, which is not a Sia-dependent group [92] . In addition, the rat strain 1086C appeared to acquire the ability to replicate effectively in buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells as a result of 3 amino acid mutations, Lys49Glu, Leu142Phe, and Ile180Ala, in VP1 that provided the ability to bind to the sialylated BRL cell 512 Nongluk Sriwilaijaroen and Yasuo Suzuki surface after 29 passages [87] .

These viruses are currently members of the genus Orthoreovirus (\"true\" reoviruses). One species of this genus, the mammalian orthoreoviruses (also called reoviruses), which are classified as nonfusogenic viruses because infectious virus particles, which are activated in the clathrin-dependent endosome by proteolysis of outer shell proteins resulting in capsid conformational rearrangement and exposure of a hydrophobic part of a viral membrane-penetration protein, can penetrate, without fusing with the endosomal membrane, into the host cytosol [111] , contains three serotypes (types), 1, 2, and 3, that infect a variety of mammalian species including humans. In humans, reoviruses usually cause subclinical or mild respiratory illness, such as common cold and enteritis, but sometimes might lead to severe illnesses (Table 2 ) including a CNS disease in infants [112] . The spread to and infection of the CNS by reoviruses in newborn mice have been also shown to be serotype-specific; type 1 spreads hematogenously to the infection site, ependymal cells, producing nonlethal hydrocephalus, whereas type 3 spreads neutrally to infect neurons, resulting in lethal encephalitis [113] . Type 2 has not been studied in detail due to the difficulty in experimental propagation. This serotype-specific pattern of neurotropism is primarily determined by the viral attachment \u03c31 protein encoded by the viral S1 gene. Ten segmented dsRNAs of the reoviruses are divided into three classes according to their size: three segments are large (L1, L2, L3), three are medium sized (M1, M2, M3), and four are small (S1, S2, S3, S4). Each segment encodes one protein, except for the S1 gene encoding structural and nonstructural proteins, which are denoted by Greek letters corresponding to the L, M, and S segments that encode them: \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03c3 proteins with numbering of the proteins that is not related to the segment numbers that encode them, for example, the S4 gene encodes a \u03c33 protein [111] . As shown in Fig. 3e , f, the outer shell of this double-shelled virus is composed mainly of the \u03bc1 protein including its cleavage products and the \u03c33 protein and partly of the homotrimeric spike \u03c31 protein interacting with the homopentameric turret-like spike \u03bb2 protein at each vertex of 12 vertices of the virus particle. The serotype-specific differences in routes of spread and in recognition of different cells in the CNS of newborn mice are thought to be due not to conserved binding located at the base of the \u03c31 head domain of these viruses to junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) but to different binding specificities of \u03c31 proteins of these viruses to sialyl glycans. Early binding specificity studies of reoviruses showed that reovirus hemagglutination is serotype-specific; types 1 and 2 preferentially agglutinate human erythrocytes, while type 3 favors bovine erythrocytes [114] . However, detailed structures of the sialyl sugar chains from these erythrocytes are still unknown. It is only known that there is only Neu5Ac in human erythrocytes [115] but that there are both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc with a higher ratio of Neu5Gc in bovine erythrocytes [53] . Detailed information on Sia-binding specificity of reoviruses has been obtained by using glycan array screening and structural studies on the co-crystals of recombinant protein \u03c31 of prototypic type 1 strain Lang (T1L) [116] or prototypic type 3 strain Dearing (T3D) [117] and sialyl glycan. Glycan array analysis of T1L \u03c31 binding to gangliosides indicated that the GM2 binding signal is stronger than GM3, GM1, and GD1a binding signals [116] . GM2 appeared to specifically decrease type 1, but not type 3, infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The crystal structure of T1L \u03c3 1 in complex with GM2 showed that both terminal Neu5Ac and GalNAc moieties of GM2 make contact with protein \u03c3 1 in a shallow groove in the globular head domain, while the crystal structure of the T1L \u03c3 1-GM3 (lacking terminal GalNAc) complex (Fig. 3e) showed that only terminal Neu5Ac of the GM3 trisaccharide interacts with T1L \u03c31 [116]. In contrast, the crystal structure of T3D \u03c3 1 in complex with \u03b12-3-sialyllactose (a trisaccharide of GM3) showed that Neu5Ac makes extensive contact with each body domain of homotrimeric \u03c3 1 protein and that the lactose (Gal-Glc) moieties participate in the contact in different directions in each body domain, presumably as a result of flexibility of the three binding sites [117] . Figure 3f shows that not only terminal Neu5Ac but also the third sugar Glc of \u03b12-3-sialyllactose has direct hydrogen bonds with the binding site of T3D \u03c3 1. The T3D \u03c31 binding site can also accommodate \u03b12-6-sialyllactose and \u03b12-8-disialyllactose with either Neu5Ac or Neu5G [116, 117] .

The outer shell consists of the glycoprotein VP7 layer and protruded VP4 dimeric spikes. In the presence of trypsin (a serine protease), VP4 is cleaved into VP5 * and VP8 * .

They are mediumsized (70-100 nm) non-enveloped viruses with a linear dsDNA genome. Type 90 (Ad90 or HAdV-90) has recently been identified, and there are currently 90 identified HAdV types [130] that are grouped into 7 species, A to G. Only some types in species D that are associated with human ocular diseases and type 52, the only current member in species G, that is associated with gastroenteritis are thought to use Sia as a primary receptor ( Table 2 ). As shown in Fig. 3g , the viral capsid of HAdV is constructed from hexon trimers and penton pentamers that project long fiber trimers outward from each vertex. The fiber trimers carry receptor-binding sites at each monomeric distal globular end, the knob domain, for binding to primary receptors on the host cell surface. The primary binding allows the penton pentamers to make contact with secondary receptors on the host cell surface, leading to endocytosis typically via clathrin [131] . However, it has been shown that endocytosis of the human adenovirus type 37 in species D (HAdV-D37) into corneal cells uses caveolin-1 proteins clustered in lipid rafts [132] . Based on reduction of fiber knob/virus binding and infection of sialidase-treated cells, 6 types of ocular pathogens in HAdV species D including 8, 26, 37, 53 (a natural intertypic recombinant of HAdV types 8, 22 and 37), 54 (believed to be an HAdV-D8 variant strain), and 64 (formally known as 19a, a natural recombinant of HAdV types 19p (p \u00bc prototype), 22 and 37) [133] have so far been shown to use Sia as a primary cellular receptor for binding that is mediated by their trimeric fiber knobs [134] [135] [136] . Pretreatment of cells with an NA reduced interactions of HAdV-D19p, which does not cause an eye infection, but did not affect its productive infection, suggesting that Sia may support the virus attachment but is not used as a functional receptor for virus infection [134] . X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that both HAdV-D37 and HAdV-D19p fiber knobs, which have only two different amino acids (Lys240 and Asn340 for HAdV-37 and Glu240 and Asp340 for HAdV-D19p), bind to both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6-sialyllactose, indicating that sialyllactoses are not determinants of the tropism of these viruses [137] . Glycan array screening showed that the HAdV-37 knob domain specifically binds to GD1a glycan, which is a disialyl branched hexasaccharide. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that GD1a glycan binding to the HAdV-D37 knob has about 260-fold higher affinity with K d of 19 \u03bcM than binding of sialyllactose to the HAdV-D37 knob with K d of 5 mM [137] , presumably because two terminal Sias on a single GD1a glycan can directly interact with two of three binding sites in the trimeric knob (Fig. 3g) as indicated by molecular modeling, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray crystallographic studies [138] . Several experiments have indicated that HAdV-D37 binds to cell surface O-linked glycoproteins rather than to ganglioside. For example, neither reduction of ganglioside biosynthesis by treatment with P4 compound [(1R,2R)-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol] nor removal of cell surface Nglycans by treatment with PNGase F affected binding of HAdV-D37 to HCE cells, while reduction of O-linked glycan synthesis by treatment with benzylGalNAc efficiently inhibited binding of HAdV-D37 to HCE cells and infection of the cells. Thus, O-linked glycoproteins that carry glycans that mimic GD1a glycan are functional host receptors of HAdV-D37. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that fiber knobs of HAdV-D37 and HAdV-D64 have identity of 100% [136] , suggesting that HAdV-D64 possesses the same binding pocket with preferential binding to O-linked glycoproteins bearing GD1a glycan. Fiber knobs of HAdV-D8, HAdV-D26, HAdV-D53, and HAdV-D54 carrying some amino acids that are different from those in the above fiber knobs [135, 136] should be further identified for determining positions of amino acids in 3D structures of the fiber knobs and screened for their receptorbinding specificity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 295, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1050, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1603, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1733, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1739, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1745, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2019, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2352, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2710, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2958, "end": 2963, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 3723, "end": 3728, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 4001, "end": 4006, "text": "[135,", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 4007, "end": 4011, "text": "136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 558, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 574, "end": 581, "text": "Fig. 3g", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2849, "end": 2858, "text": "(Fig. 3g)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Adenoviridae"}, {"text": "Using virus overlay protein blot assays, HAdV-D37 (Ad37) has been shown to interact with a human conjunctival (Chang C) membrane protein with an approximate molecular weight of 45 kDa (CAR) in a calcium-independent manner, with a Chang C membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50 kDa (a membrane protein that was later identified as CD46) in a calcium-dependent manner and with a Chang C membrane protein with a molecular weight of 60 kDa (sialylated protein) in a calcium-dependent manner. Pretreatment of Chang C cells with anti-CAR antibodies had 520 Nongluk Sriwilaijaroen and Yasuo Suzuki little effect on HAdV-D37 infection, indicating that HAdV-D37 infection does not use CAR to infect Chang C conjunctival cells. Pretreatment of Chang C cells with an NA led to abolishment of HAdV-D37 binding to the 60-kDa protein but did not affect HAdV-D37 binding to the 50-kDa protein and infection. These findings suggested that HAdV-D37 can bind to and infect conjunctival cells through the 50-kDa protein (CD46) independently of Sia [139] . Typically, HAdVs have one type of fiber trimers, but all enteric HAdVs including species F containing HAdV-F40 and HAdV-F41 and species G containing HAdV-G52 have two different types of fiber trimers, long and short. All of these three viruses use their longer fibers for attachment to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on target cells. However, HAdV-F40 and -F41 short fibers do not bind to Sia, while HAdV-G52 short fibers have been shown to attach specifically to Sia. It appears that HAdV-G52 requires either CAR or Sia for virus infection. Removal of the host cell surface Sia by NA treatment abolished HAdV-G52 binding to and infection of Sia-expressing original Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells but did not abolish (only partly reduced) virus binding to CHO cells that also express CAR (CAR-expressing CHO cells). When compared to original CHO cells, HAdV-G52 showed a remarkable increase in binding to CAR-expressing CHO cells [140] . Thus, HAdV-G52 may use its long or short fiber knob or both knobs for attachment to host CAR and/or Sia as a primary receptor or co-primary receptors to initiate virus infection. However, there are several questions that need to be answered for understanding the mechanism of virus infection. For example, why do all three known enteric HAdVs have two spikes (fibers), while other HAdVs need only one primary receptor-binding spike? Why do short fibers of HAdV species F not bind to Sia like short fibers of species G do?

Binding of a parvovirus to one or more plasma membrane receptors initiates virus infection typically via clathrin-mediated endocytosis that is possibly breached by lipolytic activity of phospholipase A2 located on the N-terminal \"unique region\" of VP1 (uVP1). This leads to release and transport of the capsid and/or viral DNA into the cytosol and the nucleus [146] . Receptor binding is a function of a viral capsid protein (CP) as shown in Fig. 3h . Depending on the virus strain and the maturation stage, each CP is comprised of two to four overlapping capsid proteins (called VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4). Sixty copies (subunits) of each CP are assembled to build an icosahedral capsid surrounding the parvovirus [147] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 819, "end": 824, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1021, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1389, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1741, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1466, "end": 1473, "text": "Fig. 3h", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Parvoviridae"}, {"text": "VP1 and VP2 are formed by alternative splicing of the same messenger RNA (mRNA), and the entire sequence of VP2 is encoded within the VP1 gene.

VP3 and VP4 are likely to be produced through posttranslational cleavage of the N-terminal amino acids of VP2 and VP3, respectively. VP1 is produced at a much lower copy number than that of VP2. However, the major capsid component seems to be the final product of posttranslational cleavage [147] . As shown in Fig. 3h , it is an adeno-associated viral capsid consisting of VP1 (full-length VP protein), VP2 (lacking uVP1), and VP3 (lacking nuclear localization signal, NLS), but not VP4, with a ratio of around 1:1:10 [148, 149] . Why do all VPs contain the same receptor-binding site? Are there different roles? Binding of VP1 to a receptor(s) seems to be involved in triggering conformational changes in the uVP1 region [148] , leading to exposure of the phospholipase A2 domain from the capsid interior that is critical for viral infectivity as mentioned above.

For autonomous parvoviruses, bovine parvovirus (BPV) [150] and porcine parvovirus (PPV) [151] are known to bind to \u03b12-3 O-linked and either Olinked or N-linked sialic acids, respectively, on the cell surface for attachment. Binding to both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6Sia of canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) which is a canineadapted form that emerged in 1978 in cats does not seem to be for cell infection, though their binding preferences to different Sia types, CPV specific for Neu5Ac and FPV specific for Neu5Gc, seem to be determinants of host adaptation in dogs and cats, respectively [152] . During evolution, it appeared that binding of CPV to Sia drifted from neutral pH to acidic pH in association with an Asn375Asp mutation in VP2. This virus variant (CPV type 2a, CPV-2a) emerged in 1979 and replaced the CPV-2 strain globally. FPV (Asp375) and CPV-2a (Asp375), which are transmitted through an oro-nasal route, can cause preferential binding to Sia at pH below 6.5 and were assumed to allow attachment of virus progenies released from infected progenitor cells in crypts of the intestinal epithelium to Sias on materials, such as mucus, in the intestinal lumen, where its pH is around 5.5-6.6. Such binding was suggested to enhance virus shedding in stools and persistence in the environment for transmission to other hosts [152] . This is an example of Sia-binding viral lectins, VP2 of CPV and FPV, that evolved not for infection of target cells. Another Sia-binding viral lectin that is not used for virus infection is spike (S) protein of several strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a linear (+)ssRNA enveloped virus in the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets and binds to specific \u03b12-3Neu5Gc.

The Sia-binding sites play a determinant role in cellular tropism of these two viruses and are thus important for tumor selectivity (oncotropism). Some studies have shown that a change in amino acid residues of the Sia-binding site affects receptorbinding preference that probably lead to a change in host range, expanded/restricted/retargeted [147, 154] . For example, constructed recombinant MVMp (p, prototype strain) viruses with VP Ile362Ser and/or Lys368Arg substitution(s) near the Sia-positioned dimple according to substitutions in lethal MVM variants derived from infection of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by the apathogenic strain (MVMp) were reported to have a lower affinity for Sia receptors, produce a large-plaque phenotype in cell lines in vitro, and cause lethal disease in SCID mice [147] . That study not only indicated that lowering of the Sia receptor-binding affinity of the virus leads to extension of viral tropism and a dramatic increase in viral pathogenicity but also suggested that a virus variant can be generated via both genetic engineering and natural selection.

However, an immune response to AAV transduction has sometimes been observed, leading to limitation of the use of AAV vectors.

AAV1, AAV4, AAV5, and AAV6 bind to the terminal Sia by the viral capsid Sia-binding motif found on all CP components, VP1, VP2, and VP3, but they differ in binding preference for the asialo portion, including glycosidic linkage types.

Also, BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) can be reactivated to cause nephropathy in renal transplant recipients [163] . In addition, polyomaviruses (poly-\u00bc many, \u00c0oma \u00bc tumors) can transform cells in cultures and in immunocompromised laboratory animals including newborn mice [164] . Surprisingly, simian virus 40 (SV40), which is a monkey virus that was accidentally introduced into humans with contaminated polio vaccine and is able to be transmitted among humans, has recently been detected in a variety of human cancers [165] . The increasing number of detected human and animal polyomaviruses raises concerns that polyomaviruses might acquire mutation and/or recombination with human polyomaviruses with the potential to cause diseases and cancers. To infect a host cell, a polyomavirus, which is a non-enveloped DNA virus, must bind to a receptor(s) on the host plasma membrane, triggering caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (for JCPyV), and navigate through the ER before delivery of its DNA genome into the nucleus for transcription and replication (Fig. 1) . It should be noted that a caveolin/clathrin-independent pathway was observed for some polyomaviruses such as entry of BKPyV into primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells [166] . Viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) is responsible for engagement of the host cell receptor, an important step that determines cellular tropism and pathogenesis of the virus. Internalization of JCPyV into cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis unlike other related polyomaviruses, including murine polyomavirus (mPy causing tumors in newborn mice, not shown in the table), SV40, BKPyV, and MCPyV, suggested that JCPyV has receptor-binding preference that is different from other related polyomaviruses. JCPyV prefers \u03b12-6Sia neolacto-series on N-linked glycoproteins [167, 168] while its binding to the 5-HT 2 serotonin receptor seems to facilitate this endocytosis pathway [169] . SV40, mPy, and BKPyV (either caveolin-dependent or caveolin-independent entry) share a common binding for ganglio-series gangliosides [166, [170] [171] [172] with differential binding preferences. SV40 prefers the branched \u03b12-3Sia GM1 ganglioside [170] , mPyV mainly attaches \u03b12-3Sia on GD1a/GT1b/GT1a [173, 174] , and BKPyV and MCPyV commonly prefer to bind to \u03b12-8Sia b-series gangliosides including GD3/GD2/GD1b/GT1b for BKPyV [171] and GT1b in cooperative binding with a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) for MCPyV [172] . Comparison of the crystal structures of BKPyV VP1-GD3 and SV40 VP1-GM1 (Fig. 3i) and site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided an important evidence that the amino acid at position 68 is responsible for different \u03b12-3/\u03b12-8 linkage preferences of these two viruses and thus acts as a determinant of receptor specificity.

The difference in sialyl linkage binding preference of human mumps HNs from human influenza HAs indicates that further analysis of sialyl glycans expressed on mumps target sites including human parotid gland epithelial cells is needed for clarifying the different tissue tropism of these viruses. Neu5Ac of \u03b12-3-sialyllactose is bound by an arginine triad (Arg180, Arg422, and Arg512), Glu264, and Tyr323, whereas Glc-3 of the compound forms a hydrogen bond with Val476 in a top pocket of the HN head domain.

Studies on substrate specificities of enzymatic de-O-acetylation of PToV and BToV HEs indicated that PToV HE prefers 9-mono-O-acetylated Sias (Neu5,9Ac 2 ), whereas BToV can catalyze both mono-and di-O-acetylated Sias (Neu5,7,9Ac 3 ) as substrates.

Observation of the synthetic receptor 4,9-di-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac\u03b12Me in the receptorbinding pocket of an esterase-deficient PToV HE indicated that the receptor-binding domain of PToV HE can bind to 4,9-di-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac-and possibly that an O-acetyl group at C7, but not at C4, is obstructed, assumedly by the side chains of Val166 and Tyr118 near C7 of the Neu5Ac glycerol side chain. However, the difference in PToV and BToV HE esterase-substrate specificities indicated that viral HE proteins have adaptation in their host [64] . Further analysis of glycan profiles on each of the host mucins and host target cells on the mid-jejunum to distal ileum together with HE amino acid sequencing and direct receptor-binding assays and esterasesubstrate specificity assays should lead to an understanding of host-driven viral HE evolution of interactions between hostspecific HE proteins of toroviruses and O-acetylated Sias.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1375, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2603, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "528"}, {"text": "Crystallization of CVA24v with several commercially available sialyloligosaccharides that have differences in glycan composition and linkage, including 6 0 SL, 3 0 SL, 3 0 SLN, LSTc, GD1a, sialyl-Le x , GD1b, DSLNT, GM1, GM2, and GD3, revealed that the virus has preferential binding to \u03b12-6-sialyllactose (6 0 SL) and disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT, a hexasaccharide (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3 (Neu5Ac\u03b12-6)GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b21-4Glc-) that carries Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal-and Neu5Ac\u03b12-6GlcNAc-terminals); very weak binding to \u03b12-3-sialyl glycans in 3 0 SL, 3 0 SLN, and sialyl-Le x ; and undetectable binding to \u03b12-8, \u03b12-3-disialyl glycan in GD1b and GD3 and branched \u03b12-3-sialylated glycans in GM1, GM2, and GD1a [90] .

The structure of T1L \u03c31 in complex with the GM3 trisaccharide of Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4Glc-(\u03b12-3-sialyllactose) indicated that only Neu5Ac sugar forms hydrogen bonds with Asn353, Thr355, Ser370, Gln371, and Thr373. The lactose moiety of the GM3 trisaccharide does not make contact with the binding pocket. The crystal structure of the T1L \u03c31-GM2 complex (not shown here) revealed that in addition to the terminal Neu5Ac moiety, the other terminal GalNAc moiety of GM2 provides additional optimal contact via van der Waals interactions in the binding pocket. This suggested that additional GalNAc at the terminal plays an important role in contact with the T1L \u03c31 binding pocket, explaining why T1L\u03c31 has higher binding preference for GM2 than for GM3 in a glycan array binding assay [116] . This is different from interactions between T3D \u03c31 and \u03b12-3-sialyllactose [117] in that the \u03b12-3-sialyllactose structure in the T3D \u03c31 pocket adopts a topology different from the topology seen in the T1L \u03c31 pocket.

The crystal structure of the HAdV-D37 fiber knob in complex with GD1a oligosaccharide was then determined [138] . Figure 3g shows the specific interactions between GD1a oligosaccharide, Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b21-4 (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3)Gal\u03b21-4Glc-, and an HAdV-D37 trimeric fiber capsid protein that protrudes from another capsid protein, a penton base.

The HAdV-D37 knob residues, Tyr312, Pro317, and Lys345, of each protomer provide direct hydrogen bond formation with each terminal Neu5Ac. Lys345 in one protomer (sky blue color) also provides indirect hydrogen bond formation with GalNAc-3 via a water molecule (not shown). In silico substitution of Lys345 to Ala suggested and an in vitro experiment confirmed a crucial role of Lys345 in Sia-binding specificity of the HAdV-D37 knob. The Lys345Ala mutation leads to almost complete abolishment of binding of the HAdV-D37 knob to cells [138] , indicating that the ability of this protein to bind to Sia on the cell surface is important for HAdV-D37 knob-cell binding. The importance of Sia for HAdV-D37 infection was verified when HAdV-D37 infection of human corneal epithelial cells was decreased in the presence of multivalent Sia conjugated to human serum albumin compared to that in the presence of a monovalent Sia-conjugated inhibitor [179] .

One of the six residues that differ between AAV1 and AAV6, Glu-531 for AAV1 (shown as a purple stick in Fig. 3h ) but Lys-531 for AAV6, appeared to be responsible for the binding ability of AAV6 to heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG).

The GM1 oligosaccharide is found in a shallow groove at the SV40 VP1 capsid outer surface in a crystal of VP1 pentamer-GM1 oligosaccharide (Fig. 3i) . Clearly, there are two critical sets of VP1 amino acid residues, (1) Ser68 and Gln84, which directly interact with Gal-of terminal Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b21via hydrogen bond formation, and (2) Gln62, Ser68, Asn272, Ser274, and Thr276, which directly form hydrogen bonds with terminal Neu5Ac\u03b12-, on the Gal\u03b21-4Glc stem of GM1 oligosaccharide.

For example, structural comparison of SV40 VP1-GM1(one Neu5Ac-terminal and one Gal-terminal) interactions with BKPyV VP1-GD3 (one Neu5Ac\u03b12-8Neu5Ac-terminal) interactions suggested that the amino acid at position 68 may regulate selective oligosaccharide affinity [171] . It appeared that a single point mutation at this site from Lys in BKPyV VP1 to Ser in SV40 VP1 enables BKPyV to change binding preference from GD3 to GM1 oligosaccharide, which was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay and by cell culture. This finding highlights the plasticity of the viral binding site leading to a change of receptor-binding specificity, which could trigger a change of cellular tropism and pathogenicity [171] . However, in the future, SV40 VP1-GM1 interactions may be used for designing antiviral drugs against SV40 infection due to an increase in reports of SV40 association with human cancers including human brain tumors, bone cancers, malignant mesothelioma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [165] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1023, "end": 1028, "text": "[170]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1299, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1733, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2020, "text": "[165]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 387, "end": 396, "text": "(Fig. 3i)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "528"}, {"text": "Sialoglycoproteins and/or gangliosides are important for infection, pathogenesis, and transmission of several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that use their spike glycoproteins and viral capsid proteins, respectively, as viral Sia-binding lectins. While some viral Sia-binding lectins may bind to Sia-containing materials, such as mucus, in order to persist in and pass through environments for transmission, most grasp host cell surface Sias (like doorknobs) either as sole, primary, or co-receptors, leading to opening of the host plasma or endosomal membrane to allow the release of the viral genome into the host cell for multiplication. While Sia-binding therapeutic viruses are useful for prevention and/or treatment of animal and human diseases, Sia-binding pathogens continue to threaten the health and life of humans and/or economic animals as epidemics and/or pandemics (including influenza A viruses, EV70, and CVA24v). For the development of effective and specific Sia-binding therapeutic viruses and for effective control of Sia-binding pathogens, we reviewed the history up to recent data for sialyl glycans and binding of viruses to Sia, and we generated tables of Sia-binding viruses giving a roadmap that primarily displays links of viral lectins, Sia-binding preference, disease, host range, tissue tropism, and entry pathway in an attempt to identify similarities and differences of these viruses as well as what is still unknown and needs to further studies. It is remarkable that (1) most of the enveloped viruses in the families Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Coronaviridae have both Sia receptorbinding activity and Sia receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activity. (1-1) Why do some of these viruses have both functions on the same molecule, while others have the functions on separate molecules? (1-2) Why do Sia-binding enveloped MERS-CoV and TGEV and non-enveloped viruses (even though the genus Siadenovirus contains a putative sialidase homologue gene for which the function is not known [143] ) not encode an RDE? How can these viruses be released from traps by decoy Sia receptors such as those on mucins? (1-3) While influenza A viruses must acquire the ability to bind to \u03b12-6Sia human-type receptors for efficient transmission among humans, why do NAs of all influenza A viruses keep cleavage specificity for \u03b12-3Sia? How can these viruses be released/spread from \u03b12-6Sia-decoy mucins or infected cells? Further studies on receptor-binding and receptor-destroying structures, functions and evolution could lead to answers and consequently open avenues for efficient control of virus spread/transmission. In addition, we can summarize that (2) sialyl glycan-binding preferences of viruses are associated with glycans presented on tissues. For example, TGEV, which is a swine intestinal virus, prefers binding to Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac present in pigs, while human-adapted viruses, such as influenza A viruses, have reduced preference for binding to Neu5Gc, which is rarely detected in normal human tissues. (2-1) The targets of these Sia-binding viruses are most often eyes, respiratory system, intestine, and nervous system implying that these organs contain high levels of Sia. Thus, identification of sialyl glycan structures, being viral receptors, on these tissues of various animals should lead to an understanding of viral host and tissue tropism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2026, "end": 2031, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions, Perspectives, and Future Directions"}, {"text": "(3) Viruses with a broad range of hosts, such as influenza A viruses, coronaviruses, EMCV, caliciviruses, and rotaviruses, have zoonotic potential, and surveillance of these viruses should be maintained and plans for responses to newly emerging zoonotic diseases should be made.

(5) While the entry pathway of Sia-binding enveloped viruses is direct fusion on the host plasma membrane or fusion with the endosomal membrane, the entry pathway of Sia-binding non-enveloped viruses is endocytosis that is followed by endosomal permeabilization/lysis as a result of proteolysis and/or capsid conformational change (picornaviruses [84] , caliciviruses [109] , reoviruses [111] , and adenoviruses [131] )/lipolysis (parvoviruses [146, 148] ) or that is followed by the ERAD pathway (polyomaviruses [166] ), except for EMCV, which possibly has direct penetration of its genome through the plasma membrane.

These detections can indicate whether \u03b12-3/\u03b12-6Sia-binding viruses are present in clinical samples or not and their binding specificity to \u03b12-3Sia or \u03b12-6Sia receptors. Due to the possibility of co-infections of Sia-binding pathogens in the samples, especially poultry stool samples, further improvements in the methods for detection, such as development of tags for labeling expected individual viruses in the sample, are needed. A receptor-binding-based diagnostic method that is able to identify a virus at the level of family, genus, subtype, species, or strain will be more specific and informative than current detection methods for viral identification, surveillance in pandemic preparedness, and treatment. (2) Viral lectins are potential targets because they are required for the crucial first stage of the virus life cycle, and several antiviral lectins have been developed, but most of them act against common pathogens causing widespread severe and life-threatening diseases in humans such as sialylmimetics against rotavirus infection [183] , trivalent sialic acid-based inhibitors to treat EV-D68 infections [184] , and 6 0 SLN-lipo PGA (Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-eicosanoyl chain poly-\u03b1-L-glutamic acid) against influenza epidemics and pandemics [185] . Some viruses are Sia-independent viruses, such as rotavirus human strains K8, KU, MO, and Wa [121] and EV-D68 strains 947, 1348, and 742 [95] . Some Sia-binding pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, CVA24v, JCPyV, and MCPyV, use more than one receptor for infection. Also some viruses including SV40, BKPyV, and JCPyV in the family Polyomaviridae can use an alternative receptor for infection. These facts should be taken into consideration for drug design and treatment. In addition, sialyl glycans are important for both host and Sia-dependent viruses, and antiviral drug design should thus be selective to viral lectins compared to counterpart host lectins in order to reduce host toxicity in treatment. (2-1) The use of the antiviral lectin 6 0 SLN-lipo PGA, which inhibits influenza infection via inhibition of HAs (influenza lectins) in attachment to cell surface Sia receptors, appeared to synergize with either of the two FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved NA inhibitors (oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir) [185] , suggesting that antiviral lectins may be used in combination with an antiviral receptor-destroying enzyme, anti-NA/anti-esterase, for powered up inhibitory activities, minimized toxicity, and delayed development of resistance for potential treatment. (2-2) Some compounds, such as mumefural and its derivative [186] and Neu5Ac3\u03b1F-DSPE (C-3-fluorinated sialyl distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [187] , inhibit influenza virus infection via inhibition of both HA and NA functions, suggesting that a molecule with dual inhibitory functions of binding and releasing can be designed as a new antiviral chemotype. (2-3) Some different viruses cause infection of the same cell and share Sia-binding specificity. For example, EV70, CAV24v, and HAdV-D can bind to and infect corneal cells through \u03b12-3Neu5Ac-containing glycans.

Based on their oncolytic properties that preferentially infect and lyse cancer cells (so-called oncolytic virotherapy), reovirus T3D has been developed to be pelareorep (Reolysin \u00ae ), which was approved by the FDA in 2015 for treatment of malignant glioma and in 2017 for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. It has been continued to be investigated for treatment of other cancers and cell proliferative disorders including malignant melanoma [189] . The lack of pathogenicity of AAVs allows them to be extensively investigated as gene-therapy vectors (called viral gene therapy). Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera \u00ae ) was developed as an AAV1 vector and was approved in 2012 by the European Commission for treatment of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) in adult patients who have severe pancreatitis despite a strict low-fat diet [192] . Normally, low abundance of viral receptors on abnormal cells that need to be treated is a key limitation of the use of oncolytic viruses and viral vectors to treat human diseases. Thus, modification of viruses to efficiently bind to receptors present on the target cells is critical for virus infection. Typically, Sia-binding therapeutic viruses including reoviruses, AAVs, and vectors pseudotyped with HAdV-D fiber have more than one binding site, binding to a Sia receptor and another receptor(s). The design of a therapeutic virus for efficient binding to at least two receptors may help to prevent a mutation of the host receptor for escape from viral transfection/ transduction. Also, a virus that efficiently binds to two receptors could efficiently infect the host cell and be transmitted specifically among the target host cells. There is evidence that in addition to using ICAM-1 as an essential receptor, CVA24v, which emerged from CVA24 in 1970, caused the AHC pandemic in 1985 after adaptation of its VP1 to efficiently bind to Sia, an attachment receptor supporting ICAM-1-mediated infection of CVA24v [98] . It has also been shown that Sia-dependent rotavirus strains grow more efficiently than Sia-independent rotavirus strains in Sia-containing cells [121] . Thus, further analysis of receptor structures on host cells that need to be treated, experiments on virus binding preferences to sialyl glycan structures found on the host cells, and X-ray crystallographic studies of virus-sialyl glycan interactions coupled with structure-guided mutagenesis are needed to provide blueprints for engineering viral proteins to bind efficiently to specific sialyl glycans on the target host cells.
