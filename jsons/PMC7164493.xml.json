Patients with these respiratory dysfunctions are often unable to get the required amount of oxygen to the brain and body. This can lead to delayed recovery from acute illness, multisystem organ failure, and ultimately death. The mortality rate for cases of respiratory dysfunctions has been recently reported in the range of 31\u201375% [1]. This is especially troubling considering there are many causes of respiratory failure leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, chemical inhalation, and bacterial or viral infection.",

So far, only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been approved for medical use. However, ECMO is an unsatisfactory treatment as it possesses many of its own risks, including hemorrhage, thrombosis, and cannula malfunction. These risks eliminate ECMO as a viable treatment alternative for many patients. Therefore, we have researched an alternative technology for delivering oxygen to the body through the peritoneal cavity.",

In order to provide a patient with supplemental oxygenation, phospholipid shelled oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) would be administered to the patient. Previously, we have shown that peritoneal membrane oxygenation (PMO) with OMBs is a possible treatment method in acute lung injury models [2]. We are now extending the validity of PMO treatment by testing in long term disease models, which more accurately reflect clinical scenarios. ARDS is a medical condition that has been well established in animal models. Rat models of ARDS have been well established by tracheal delivery of the endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [3]. Our study involves two phases: (1) development and characterization of the ARDS disease model in rats; (2) design and validation of ambulatory infusion device.",

Animals are allowed to acclimate for 4 days prior to the experiments. In phase 1, the model for ARDS is evaluated and characterized. Rats are sedated with ketamine\u2013xylazine (18\u20132 mg/kg). Healthy baseline measurements of weight, chest radiographs (PRX 90, Bowie), pulse oximetry (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corp.), and venous blood analysis are then done. Analysis of venous blood from the tail vein was performed with a handheld blood analyzer (VetScan iSTAT 1, Abaxis) to determine the animal's blood gases, pH, chemistry, and hematocrit. Intratracheal administration of 0.5 ml saline with LPS (7 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed with the MicroSprayer\u00aeAerosolizer (Model IA-1B-R, PennCentury). An additional negative control (NC) group was not administered with any intratracheal solution. Observation and collection of daily blood samples and chest radiographs of each animal were performed until death or at 7 days post LPS administration. Upon completion of the observation period, living animals are then euthanized with sodium pentobarbital. Lung tissue was hematoxylin and eosin stained and sent to an independent pathologist for lung injury scoring [4].",

The overall mortality rate was 37.5% for LPS trials and 0% for NC trials. All deaths occurred within 24 hr after administration of LPS. The remaining LPS rats began recovering over the course of the 7 day observation period. Chest radiographs taken of LPS rats show clear indications of bilateral infiltrates and interstitial edema in the lungs (Fig. 1). The LPS group showed a dramatic loss in lung function from the observed SpO2 levels when compared to NCs (Fig. 2).
