Steps unique to virus replication are potential targets, as are those for which an inhibitor can be devised that has a greater selective activity against a virus-specific process than against a corresponding host process. Examples are shown in Table 12.1. A further refinement of this approach is illustrated by the nucleoside analog acycloguanosine (acyclovir), which preferentially inhibits the herpesvirus DNA polymerase essential for replication of viral DNA, rather than host cell polymerases. Acyclovir is in fact an inactive prodrug that requires another herpesvirus-coded enzyme, thymidine kinase, to phosphorylate it to its active form. As the viral enzyme occurs only in infected cells, such prodrugs are non-toxic for uninfected cells; the specificity of its action against viral rather than host replication is based on two separate selective steps.",

            "text": "New antiviral chemotherapeutic agents can come from a number of different sources:1.Large pharmaceutical companies house large banks of compounds with possible biological activities. These are screened for a desired function, for example, inhibition of the in vitro replication of a particular virus, either by direct testing of a candidate drug, or as part of sophisticated very high-throughput screening protocols. An example is AZT (zidovudine), the first successful nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used against HIV. This was synthesized in 1964 as a possible anti-cancer drug but was found to be ineffective. Much later it was reported as having anti-retrovirus activity in 1974, and then screened and found to be active against HIV in the mid-1980s (Box 12.3\n).\nBox 12.3Sources for New Candidate Antiviral Drugs\n1.Blind screening of banks of randomly synthesized compounds2.Selection or synthesis of compounds known or predicted to inhibit a target process in virus replication, for example, by binding to an active site or intermediate3.Modification of compounds already known to have antiviral effects (\u201cleads\u201d), to improve efficacy or overcome drawbacks4.Naturally occurring substances or products reported to be of therapeutic benefit\n2.Knowledge of the detailed structure of an active site critical for virus replication, for example, a viral enzyme, ligand for a receptor, or a regulatory target, allows for the creation of specific inhibitors through rational design. The neuraminidase inhibitors, a class of potent inhibitors of influenza replication, were developed by Mark von Itzstein after the fine structure of the neuraminidase protein was solved by Peter Colman using x-ray crystallography; this knowledge allowed the rational synthesis of chemical derivatives that bind tightly to the active pocket of the enzyme. A similar approach can be used to develop drugs that act by binding directly to the capsid (or envelope) of the virion itself, thereby blocking early steps in the replication cycle, for example, attachment, penetration, or uncoating. Once the three-dimensional structure of the whole surface of isometric virions such as picornaviruses is known, the receptor-binding site (the ligand) on the critical capsid protein can be characterized in atomic detail. Complexes of viral proteins with purified cell receptors or receptor mimics can be crystallized and examined directly. The receptor-binding site on the virion has generally turned out to be a \u201ccanyon,\u201d cleft, or depression on the external surface of the protein. Further steps are taken to analyze the structure of the viral protein after binding to a compound known to neutralize infectivity, to map the particular amino acid residues found to be substituted in resistant mutants of virus, or to use site-specific mutagenesis in order to identify critical residues. This information can then be exploited to design better synthetic drugs, using computer modeling to optimize the fit and the binding energy of the drug\u2013virus interaction.3.Once an agent is found which displays a degree of specific inhibition for a viral enzyme or other process integral to viral replication (\u201clead\u201d molecule), related analogs (congeners) of the prototype are then synthesized with a view to enhancing its activity, solubility, and bioavailability, or reducing its toxicity.4.It is often proposed that natural products (e.g., \u201cfolk medicines\u201d) that are reported to be of benefit against particular diseases may contain active ingredients from which new classes of potent antivirals can be developed. This area of discovery continues to hold hope, but all too often these products turn out to be complex mixtures and the apparent therapeutic benefit seems to wane as the material is fractionated into its components.\n",

In its simplest form, resistance may be due to a single point mutation in the gene encoding the particular viral protein that is the target of the compound. Stepwise increases in the degree of resistance may occur as further nucleotide substitutions accumulate, often in a particular order. Drug-resistant strains often show less replication fitness and/or less virulence, and may be replaced by wild-type virus in cell culture or in a patient unless maintained by the selection pressure of the continuing presence of the drug. However, as a demonstration of the power of selection, such resistant strains may also develop further compensatory mutations that enhance replication fitness.BOX 12.5Resistance to Antiviral Drugs\n\u25cfDuring replication of virus nucleic acids, errors (base changes) continually occur.

The principles needed to minimize this problem are well understood from experience with antibiotic resistance in bacteria and cancer chemotherapy. Antiviral agents should be administered in sufficiently high dosage and without interruption, so that inhibitory drug levels are maintained. Combination therapy with two or more agents (preferably with distinct modes of action) is theoretically attractive and has been shown with HIV to greatly delay the appearance of resistance and improve the therapeutic response. Furthermore, if this allows one or both drugs to be given at a lower dose, combination therapy can reduce the incidence of toxic side effects. Patient compliance became a major difficulty for the treatment of HIV infections requiring the maintenance of strict drug regimens, as patients eventually grow tired of maintaining strict drug regimens necessitating the taking of 20 pills at different times each day, particularly when they start to feel better! It was a major advance with the licensing in 1997 of a single tablet containing two drugs (Combivir) and later (2006) three drugs, taken once a day (e.g., Atripla, containing emtricitabine, tenofovir, and efavirenz); six more combination treatments have been approved by the United States Federal Drug Agency in the past 4 years.",

            "text": "Antiviral drugs are used successfully with a number of different strategies in mind, including:1.\nLong-term therapy in chronic infection, particularly HIV, HBV, and HCV. It is important to realize that different possible therapeutic goals may be targeted, for example (a) eradication of virus from the body, (b) suppression of virus replication so that viral load in the plasma is greatly reduced or undetectable, (c) delaying or preventing clinical disease, disease progression, or death, or (d) improving laboratory markers of disease, for example, liver function tests (hepatitis), and CD4 cell count (HIV). These options should be clearly understood both in the planning of clinical treatment and in the design of drug trials. The outcome of a long-term treatment course is designated as either IR (initial response), ETR (end-of-treatment response, i.e., possibly followed by rebound), or SR (sustained response, i.e., no rebound occurring).2.\nImmediate treatment of acute infection, for example, neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza, acyclovir or a derivative for acute herpes simplex infection. As in many of these infections the virus replication peaks early in the clinical disease and wanes thereafter: a rapid initiation of treatment has been shown to be very important to achieve optimal benefit.3.\nProphylaxis against disease progression or recrudescence, or to prevent viral shedding. Patients suffering from frequent recrudescence of genital herpes can have their lives transformed by long-term daily maintenance therapy with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valaciclovir. Similarly, use of valganciclovir in transplant patients, either prophylactically to all those with pre-existing CMV antibody (i.e., persistent infection), or pre-emptively for those found to have laboratory evidence of CMV replication, has led to a major reduction in CMV disease among these patients.4.\nPrevention of virus transmission. Without intervention, approximately 25% of infants born to HIV-infected mothers become infected. This can be reduced to approximately 2%, a dramatically important result, by an appropriate combination of three antiviral drugs given to the mother in late pregnancy and to the infant after birth, combined with Caesarean section if viral suppression has not been achieved by the time of labor, and combined with avoidance of breastfeeding. Other regimens include intravenous zidovudine, or nevirapine as a short course or single dose to mother and infant at delivery.\n",

Substances designed to mimic either the cell receptor or the viral ligand should theoretically accomplish this. For example, attachment of HIV to its receptor (CD4) can be blocked by soluble CD4 (which binds to the virion), or by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the ligand on the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 that binds to the cell receptor. Another example of the latter is the blockage of the HIV co-receptor CCR-5, using either a ligand mimic or an antibody that binds to the site. Maraviroc is a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist now approved for treatment of HIV; when co-administered with standard treatment it has been shown to lead to an improved outcome. A major problem with ligand mimics is that saturation of cell receptors may occur, and therefore interfere with the normal physiological function of that membrane glycoprotein. Maraviroc has been reported to cause allergic reactions and hepatotoxicity. Receptor mimics may be safe but would need to be confirmed as not eliciting an autoimmune response.",

Many of the studies to date have used human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV-14) as a model. Most of the drugs, in spite of a diversity in chemical structure, bind to the same site on HRV-14, namely, a hydrophobic pocket that lies immediately beneath the floor of the canyon that comprises the ligand (receptor-binding site) on the viral capsid protein VP1. Following binding of the drug, hydrophobic interactions result in deformation of the canyon floor; this inhibits virion attachment to cell receptors, but, more importantly, also inhibits uncoating of the virion. This is thought to occur by locking VP1 into a conformation, thus preventing the disassembly of the virion that normally occurs in the acidic environment of the endosome. When administered prophylactically rather than therapeutically, antivirals of this nature have been claimed to reduce the symptoms of the common colds induced by certain rhinovirus serotypes but not others. A promising example of such a drug was Pleconaril, which was shown in randomized double-blind clinical trials to reduce the symptoms in patients with self-diagnosed colds: resistant virus strains have been reported. However, its efficacy was not fully established, and as a consequence the Food and Drug Administration of the United States declined to approve its use in 2003.

            "text": "In the 1960s the simple three-ringed symmetrical amine amantadine was synthesized and shown to inhibit the replication of influenza A viruses (but not influenza B viruses). The principal target of amantadine is the protein M2, which is a minor component of the influenza viral envelope. Influenza B lacks an M2 protein, and thus amantadine\u2019s specificity for influenza A can be understood. M2 forms a tetrameric transmembrane ion channel that reduces the pH gradient across the envelope of incoming virions within acidic endosomes. It is also thought to play a role in assisting the transport of newly synthesized HA to the plasma membrane by reducing transmembrane gradients across the trans-Golgi cisternae. Thus, amantadine acts at these two distinct steps in the replication cycle as an ion channel blocker. First, by raising the pH of the endosome, amantadine prevents the pH 5-mediated conformational change in the HA molecule required for fusion of viral envelope with endosomal membrane. Second, later in the replication cycle, by disturbing the ionic environment within the exocytic pathway, amantadine prevents newly synthesized HA from assuming the correct conformation for incorporation into the envelope of budding virions.",

Acycloguanosine, now commonly known as acyclovir, is a guanine derivative with an acyclic side chain, the full chemical name being 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine (Fig. 12.1\n). Its unique advantage over earlier nucleoside derivatives is that the herpesvirus-encoded enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK), which has broader specificity than cellular TK, is required to phosphorylate acycloguanosine intracellularly to acycloguanosine monophosphate (ACG-P); a cellular GMP kinase then completes the phosphorylation to the active agent, acycloguanosine triphosphate (ACG-PPP) (Fig. 12.2\n). Further, ACG-PPP inhibits the herpesvirus-encoded DNA polymerase at least 10 times more effectively than it does cellular DNA polymerase \u03b1. It acts as both inhibitor and substrate of the viral enzyme, competing with GTP and being incorporated into DNA: chain termination is the result as acyclovir lacks the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group required for chain elongation. Since activation of the prodrug needs the viral TK, acyclovir is essentially non-toxic to uninfected cells but is powerfully inhibitory to viral DNA synthesis in infected cells, giving it much greater selectivity than is the case with the earlier nucleoside analogs.",

Other human herpesviruses, lacking a gene coding for TK, are susceptible only at much greater doses; this results from the limited production of ACG-P by cellular GMP kinase. The relative sensitivity of different herpesviruses seems to depend on a rather complex interplay of at least three variables: (1) the efficiency of the virus-coded TK (if any) in converting acyclovir to ACG-P, (2) the efficiency of cellular kinases in converting this intermediate to ACG-PPP, and (3) the susceptibility of the viral DNA polymerase to ACG-PPP. The use of acyclovir for treatment of various herpesvirus diseases is discussed in Chapter 17: Herpesviruses. Acyclovir (Zovirax) may be delivered orally, by slow intravenous infusion, or topically as an aqueous cream. As anticipated from in vitro studies, the drug is essentially non-toxic. Acyclovir levels must be carefully monitored in patients with dehydration or renal impairment, as the drug, which is excreted unchanged through the kidneys, is relatively insoluble, and crystalluria may occur.

A 48-week course of entecavir treatment in chronic hepatitis B has been shown to give suppression of serum hepatitis B virus DNA and normalization of liver function in a greater proportion of patients than with lamivudine treatment, although the safety profiles of the two drugs are similar. Other drugs to which hepatitis B virus responds in a proportion of patients include telbivudine and pegylated interferon.",

When a hydroxyethylene linkage replaces the peptide bond, cleavage does not occur; viral proteins continue to be made, but the viral particles budding from cells are immature and non-infectious. A range of different inhibitors that bind to, and block, the active site are now in routine use, usually as part of combination therapy (Table 12.1; Fig. 12.5\n). As would be expected, resistant strains of HIV may arise, many of which are unique to a particular inhibitor. Side effects, which can be troublesome, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, redistribution of body fat to the trunk regions, and abnormal liver function.",

            "text": "Antiviral treatment of hepatitis C infection has undergone a radical change since 2011, with the progressive introduction of three classes of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs). This development has been possible due to the synthesis of specific inhibitors of the active sites of three key viral gene products: the NS3-4A protease, the NS5A RNA-binding protein, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For example, sofosbuvir is a nucleotide monophosphate analog that, after conversion to the active triphosphate within the cell, becomes incorporated into the growing RNA chain and acts as a chain terminator. The NS3-NS4A protease of hepatitis C virus complex offers an attractive target. The peptidomimetic drugs boceprevir and telaprevir were licensed for use in the United States in 2011, but have since been largely replaced by second-generation protease inhibitors (simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir) with improved safety and dosage profiles. When used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin the rate of sustained virological response nearly doubled and they have been of particular benefit in more difficult-to-treat patients such as those with cirrhosis or those infected with HCV genotype 1. Sustained viral responses were achieved with shorter courses of treatment, and more recent trials have demonstrated success with interferon-free regimens in most patients. These drugs represent the first of a large number of direct-acting antivirals at different stages of development, ushering in an exciting new phase in the treatment of hepatitis C virus. Six different combinations of these drugs are now recommended for use against different HCV genotypes, and permanent cure can be achieved for most patients using a shorter and completely interferon-free regimen. A truly remarkable advance.",

            "text": "The development of highly effective neuraminidase inhibitors became feasible when analysis of the three-dimensional structure of influenza neuraminidase revealed the location and structure of the catalytic site (see above). Two successful agents zanamavir (delivered intranasally) and oseltamivir (delivered orally) have become important in influenza treatment and prophylaxis. Both bind strongly to the enzyme active site and prevent release of progeny virions, thereby preventing infection of new cells and the further spread of infection. When used within 24 to 30 hours of the onset of symptoms, either drug can shorten the duration of symptoms by one to three days, and these are also useful as prophylactic treatment. In contrast to the adamantanes, zanamavir and oseltamivir cause very little toxicity and are associated with less problems of drug resistance. Each has a broad spectrum of action across influenza strains of both type A and type B, and a low rate of drug resistance makes each an important component in planning for future pandemics. Stockpiles of drugs are maintained to provide rapid prophylaxis and treatment, if required in the lead-up period before a specific vaccine against a new pandemic strain becomes available. However, cost and logistics will of course limit how extensively and for how long such treatment can be sustained in the face of a new pandemic. More recently developed neuraminidase inhibitors include peramivir, an intravenous agent authorized for emergency use in hospitalized patients suffering from 2009 H1N1 influenza, and laninamivir, which is active against oseltamivir-resistant viruses and has such a long-lasting effect that a single inhalation on the first day of treatment appears to be effective.",

For example, hybridization to viral mRNA may prevent the splicing, transport, or translation of that mRNA, or render it susceptible to degradation by RNase H. On the other hand, hybridization to either viral DNA or cDNA might block transcription or replication, or block the attachment of DNA-binding regulatory proteins. Short single-stranded DNA sequences of this nature have displayed antiviral activity against HIV, herpes simplex virus, and influenza viruses in cultured cells. Moreover, the ability of naturally occurring micro-RNAs (miRNAs) to regulate gene function has provided encouragement for such an approach against viruses. In practice, major problems with the specificity, stability, and uptake of oligodeoxynucleotides have hindered this work. Oligonucleotides are rapidly degraded by extracellular and intracellular nucleases, unless the backbone of the molecule is modified, for example, to phosphorothioate linkages, to circumvent this problem. Moreover, the uptake of oligonucleotides into cells is very inefficient; attempts are being made to facilitate entry, such as the coupling of miRNAs to a hydrophobic peptide or lipid.\n",

For example, the Tat protein binds to a specific responsive element called TAR which is present in both the integrated HIV cDNA and all HIV mRNAs. This binding results in enhanced expression of all the HIV genes, including tat itself, thereby constituting a positive feedback loop that enables production of large numbers of progeny virions. Clearly, an agent capable of binding either to the Tat protein or to the TAR nucleotide sequence should be a most effective inhibitor of HIV replication. Screening based on inhibition of the Tat\u2013TAR interaction has identified a number of compounds active in cell culture, but none of these is currently used clinically, partly because these agents are not easily delivered. As other regulatory elements are being discovered for many other viruses, this novel approach to antiviral chemotherapy has considerable appeal.",

Prevention of HIV and genital herpes simplex virus infection has received most attention, and the attraction of this approach includes the fact that it can be applied by the patient at the time when it is most needed. Ideally it should prevent infection before it is initiated, and the agents are likely to be relatively cheap. Agents that have been investigated include nonoxynol-9, a commercially available spermicide that unfortunately was found to damage epithelia and possibly enhance HIV transmission; various polymers, for example, polystyrene sulfonate that binds to herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B and inhibits virus uptake and spread; specific blockers of virus entry; and classical antiviral drugs, for example, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, applied locally.
