            "text": "For this research, we conducted case study research at one large organisation. For confidentiality reasons, the case company will be referred henceforth as Company A. Company A is a leading multi-brand online retailer in the UK and Ireland, selling thousands of different brands supplied by others as well as its own brand of retail goods. In this section, we bring together the various observations from the data collected using semi-structured interviews at Company A to manage cybersecurity readiness in the technical context. Cybersecurity readiness can be achieved by implementing the following security controls (themes) which emerged from the analysis of collected qualitative data.(a) Access Control and AuthenticationUsernames and passwords are treated commonly as authentication, but it is not a secure form of authentication because anyone can use these details and gain easy access to the systems. It is difficult for systems to recognise whether the user who has accessed system is genuine or fraudulent. Company A has two-factor authentication system to prevent unauthorised access. However, two-factor authentication is not always a secure method as cyber-criminals can violate this [22]. To make the authentication system more effective, biometric authentication systems may be used, for example, voice recognition, facial recognition and fingerprint scanning [23]. Therefore, Company A may consider biometric authentication systems to prevent unauthorised access.(b) Information Communication Security (ICS)ICS helps to secure electronic communication amongst staff, third parties and customers inside and outside the company. Company A encrypts the data of customers and employees when sending it to third parties and registered post is used to send hard copies of data. Using encryption for sending and receiving information is useful for a company because it prevents modification and keeps data in its original form. This encryption method has a weakness as it does not cover the recipient of any data, as this would need Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE). Therefore, Company A could P2PE to secure its communication channels more effectively [24]. Moreover, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) digital signatures and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) etc. are useful in preventing cybersecurity attacks [25]. Therefore, the company may use these for enhancing cybersecurity infrastructure.(c) Threat ManagementThreat management is an essential component of the organisation\u2019s security process. Businesses that depend on ICT remain under threat from cyber-criminals whose motive is to steal sensitive information by infiltrating systems in different ways. Now, it is the responsibility of the organisation to manage such risks cost-effectively and minimise threats to their information systems.Company A uses various security controls to minimise threats to information system infrastructure. Additionally, the company has professionals who constantly try to manage the security threats. However, some vulnerabilities still exist in these security controls for which Company A should assess regularly to manage security threats. This is also proposed by some researchers such as Taylor [11].(d) Network SecurityNetwork security has a significant role in the information system security of online retail organisations because cyber-criminals attack the network to steal information. Cyber intrusions and attacks occur when unauthorised access is gained to networks, including theft of users\u2019 sensitive data, online economic fraud, website destruction, web application attacks and system penetration. Attackers exploit operating system vulnerabilities in web browsers, services and configurations, platform vulnerabilities in web applications, network device vulnerabilities, policy and personnel vulnerabilities in unauthorised devices [26]. Company A did face cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, because of weaknesses in the network. However, encryption, anti-virus, firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are useful in preventing cyber-attacks [8]. Therefore, the company should configure its firewalls to prevent denial of service attacks on the network. Firewalls are useful in preventing unauthorised access to the network and in blocking unwanted traffic into the company\u2019s network (Sen et al.) [8]. A firewall is a shield that works against dangerous communications from disseminating across any network, either from the outside world into a local system, or from one part of a local network to another. It is a useful element in network access because it can prevent unauthorised access at the boundary of a network and infrastructure.(e) Network MonitoringICT enables business processes to operate electronically and provides facilities to conduct business activities more effectively and efficiently in the digital environment. The monitoring activities of ICT allow the company to detect vulnerabilities and respond to these appropriately by enhancing security controls. Despite such active monitoring systems, some information breaches still occur at Company A. Company A are monitoring activities inside the company and whenever unusual activity is found, they aim to resolve it immediately. The company also performs a test for vulnerabilities in its computing systems and try to fix it in the first instance. Further, the company has different teams whose work is to monitor the security processes of the company\u2019s infrastructure and prevent loopholes from being exploited. For network security, Unified Threat Management Systems (UTMS) provide more security to the network layer, hardware and software than standard detection methods because this is the combination of firewalls, pattern recognition and user authentication methods [9]. Therefore, Company A should use UTMS for effective security.\n",

Therefore, the organisation should proactively asses their technical factors rather than only assessing these after an incident has occurred. A qualitative case study approach was adopted and 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted for data collection. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The key areas of selected themes were discussed and confirmed by the managers and other staff members.",

The study suggests that organisation readiness in the cybersecurity domain can be achieved by taking proactive measures such as ICT security and risk management. The results show that online organisations are lagging behind, especially in the effective implementation of up to date technical tools and measures. Although the case organisation has implemented some measures, there is still a need to explore their functionality within the organisational structure.",

Secondly, only a qualitative case study approach was used for data collection. Therefore, there is a need to conduct multiple case studies to learn more about technical aspects of cybersecurity in other technical aspects, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This study was conducted in the UK so repetition of this research in other countries would improve the research and extend results to compare and contrast the outcomes of online retailers.",
