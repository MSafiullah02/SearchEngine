A simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive method is critical for monitoring PEDV on pig farms. In this study, a simple and rapid lateral flow immunoassay detection system that integrates europium (Eu) (III) chelate microparticles was developed to identify PEDV in fecal swabs. This newly developed diagnostic sandwich immunoassay utilizes lateral flow test strips (LFTSs). The fluorescence peak heights of the test line (HT) and the control line (HC) were measured using a fluorescence strip reader, and the HT/HC ratio was used for quantitation. The limit of detection of PEDV with this LFTS was ??ten times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per mL??. Fecal swab samples were used to determine the cutoff value. Field samples, various PEDV strains and other viruses were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTSs, which were 97.8% and 100%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 0.05, as compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results were in high agreement with those obtained by RT-PCR. Epidemiological surveillance of PEDV using the LFTSs ??in areas threatened by African swine fever virus?? suggested that the PEDV positive rate on pig farms had significantly decreased, mainly due to the implementation of strict biosecurity measures. The results indicate that the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTS system is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.",

In China, PEDV was first confirmed in 1984, and since 2010, it has caused enteric disease, which is characterized by high morbidity and mortality in pre-weaning piglets, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry nationwide [5, 14] .

            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped virus, belonging to the family Coronaviridae. It has a positive-stranded RNA genome that encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane, and envelope proteins. The PEDV N protein is important for maintaining the nucleocapsid structure and, other than the M protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, is the only coronavirus structural protein known to be phosphorylated [1, 25] . The N protein is the predominant antigen expressed by coronavirus-infected cells [7, 10] , and detection of the N protein is therefore very helpful for the clinical diagnosis of PEDV infection. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR, as well as immunohistochemical techniques and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the most common molecular techniques for the detection of PEDV antigens and antibodies [23] . Although these methods provide accurate results, they are not suitable for use by breeders on pig farms because of the need for well-trained technicians and specific equipment, in addition to the considerable amount of time and effort required. Recently, a lateral flow immunoassay, a well-established and accepted point-of-care testing technique, was used to develop quantitative fluorescent strips with various fluorescent reporters, which include colloidal gold, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, and lanthanide chelates [2, 3, 27, 28] . The first case of African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection in China was reported on August 3, 2018 [26] . By July 10, 2019, almost all provinces in China had reported the appearance of ASFV (http://www.oie.int/). Since the initial outbreak of ASFV, strict biosecurity measures have been implemented to prevent further spread of the virus. In accordance with these measures, it is forbidden to transport swine tissues and serum as well as pork. Because of the limitations of techniques for the detection of PEDV, the aim of the current study was to develop a simple point-of-care technique to quantify the PEDV N protein in fecal swabs with the use of europium (Eu) (III) chelate microparticles and lateral flow test strips (LFTSs) for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV ??in areas threatened by ASFV??.",

Glass fibers were cut into 25 \u00d7 300-mm pieces and immersed in phosphatebuffered saline (0.2 M, pH 8.0) containing 10 mM EDTA, 1% Tween-20, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature.

Another anti-PEDV N mAb (4H7) was dispensed onto the NC membrane using the dispenser mentioned above to serve as the test line, while goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were dispensed on to the NC membrane, separated by a distance of 7 mm, to serve as the control line. The mAb 4H7 and goat anti-mouse IgG pAbs were diluted with coating buffer to final concentrations of 0.025 and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. The NC membrane was dried at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h and stored in a dry package at room temperature for future use. The absorption pad was used without treatment. Then, the sample pad, conjugate pad, NC membrane, and absorbent pad were assembled onto the backing plate in the correct order, while ensuring that the ends of the four components overlapped to achieve a continuous flow from the sample pad to the absorbent pad. Subsequently, the whole plate was cut into 3-mm-wide strips, which were assembled in the strip cassettes.",

However, the above-mentioned methods are time-consuming and are mainly limited to use in the lab, with the exception of the ICA kit [18] . However, although the ICA kit is rapid, there is an important imperfection. As the results of the ICA kit are judged by the appearance of a red color on the test line, it is sometimes difficult to judge whether the results are positive if the reaction is weak. Also, even when the samples contain large amounts of PEDV N protein, no quantitative estimates are possible, as the protein cannot be quantitated by color intensity. In the present study, an LFTS was established not only to screen for PEDV infection but also to quantify the results. For the LFTS, Eu (III) chelate microparticles were used to label antibodies. The PEDV N protein in samples is captured by the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-labeled mAb 15B12 and forms Eu (III) chelate microparticle-labeled mAb-antigen complex, which can be captured by another mAb (i.e., 4H7) on the test line. The PEDV N protein is quantified by measuring the fluorescence peak heights of the test and control lines. The greater the HT/HC ratio, the more PEDV N protein is in the sample, providing an indication of the severity of the infection. As shown in Fig. 5 , the detection limit of the LFTS was 10 TCID 50 /mL, with a better sensitivity than that of RT-PCR as well as the ICA kit (100 TCID 50 /mL). Thus, the sensitivity of the Eu (III) chelate microparticle method is tenfold higher than that of the ICA kit. In this study, to improve performance, each microparticle contains thousands of Eu (III) chelates to amplify the signal.",

The sensitivity and specificity of traditional methods, such as PCR and RT-PCR, are rather limited. Rapid and sensitive methods such as colloidal gold and Eu (III) chelate microparticle fluorescence-based LFTS are easier to use for surveillance on pig farms. As shown in Table 3 , the PEDV positivity rate on pig farms has significantly decreased due to the implementation of strict biosecurity measures and well as a decrease in breeding stocks.",

The LFTS system has two main advantages: First, the cost of this simple and rapid assay is relatively low compared to conventional lateral flow strips. Second, the use of polystyrene Eu (III) chelate microparticles makes this assay more sensitive than RT-PCR. Thus, the polystyrene Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTS is very suitable for the detection and monitoring of PEDV on pig farms. ",

Two primers (PEDV-ORF3-F, 5\u2032-GGA GCT CAA TGT AGT TCC AA-3\u2032; PEDV-ORF3-R, 5\u2032-AGC TGC TTT ACC ATT GAG AA-3\u2032) were designed based on the sequence of open reading frame (ORF) 3 of PEDV strain LNCT2. The PCR reaction included an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 58 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. Afterward, the PCR products were separated on a 1.5% TAE (Tris base, acetic acid, and EDTA) agarose gel. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using MedCalc statistical software (version 9.2.1.0; https ://www. medca lc.org/) to determine the cutoff value. Sample values below the cutoff value, as determined with the LFTS, were considered negative, and those above the cutoff value were considered positive.Evaluation of the specificity and sensitivity of the LFTSDifferent PEDV strains and other porcine viruses were used to evaluate the specificity of the LFTS. Briefly, PEDV strains CV777, a genotype 1 (G1) vaccine strain (GenBank accession no. KT323979), and LNCT2, a genotype 2 (G2) strain (GenBank accession no. KT323980; LNSY, accession no. KY007140; Hjms, accession no. KY007139), as well as other porcine viruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strain H16 (GenBank accession no. FJ755618), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain NH (GenBank accession no. KU981062), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) A (GenBank accession no.
