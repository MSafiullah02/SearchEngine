Due to its specific molecular structure, PVP is soluble in water and most organic solvents. It has an excellent chelating ability to be used as a chelating agent in the medicine and food industry [12]. The toxicity of organic compounds and their solubility and diffusion in body tissues increase with the decrease in molar weight [8]. The materials obtained by ionizing irradiation of PVP and PEG [8] did not present a toxic effect. Therefore, the in vitro and in vivo evaluations suggested that these biomaterials could be safely used in contact with the skin for wound dressing management in the form of advanced bandages or for drug immobilization as transdermal therapeutic systems. PVP-based hydrogels have excellent transparency, biocompatibility, swelling capacity, ability to disperse different active compounds and have been applied as dressings for the treatment of wounds such as burns and skin ulceration [13], drug delivery systems [14], in protein release [15], atopic dermatitis [16], and skin regeneration [17, 18].",

Such dressings will help both to protect wounds from infections from the external environment (to prevent contamination) and eradicate the infection from the wound (absorb exudates, provide an ideal moisture balance at the wound surface, and kill bacteria or inhibit their growth if the hydrogel exhibits bactericidal activity). The prevention of the further spread of pathogenic microorganisms is important not only for composite hydrogel dressings (wound bandages, contact lenses, artificial skin materials, and targeted drug delivery systems) but also for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.

The beam was collimated using a three-pinhole collimator system and was focused to a beam size of 0.4 \u00d7 0.6 mm at the sample position using a bent monochromator and a bent mirror.

The maximum possible three-dimensional hydrogel network expansion was achieved due to an increase in the pore size as a result of a decrease in its rigidity. Apparently, there are changes in the polymer chain relaxation, which makes a certain contribution to the overall water adsorption kinetics, thereby resulting in the faster water desorption. It worth noting that during the first and second water desorption cycles, PVP hydrogels were dried to a smaller final weight compared to the weight of the initial gels (m0) (Table 6) and during different times (~ 146 h for the first cycle and ~ 47 h for the second cycle). This is also associated with the changes in the polymer chain relaxation in the hydrogel. After the second water desorption cycle, PVP hydrogel completely degraded.",

The content of all types of water (free, bound, half-bound, and interstitial) in TN/PVP was found to decrease and the size of structural inhomogeneities was shown to increase compared to PVP. The polymer/polymer correlation length and the fractal dimension increase with the increase in concentration of titania nanoparticles in gels. The introduction of titania nanoparticles in PVP leads to a decrease in the water swelling degree of hydrogels air-dried to constant weight compared to the corresponding PVP; however, it leads to an increase in the operating life of hydrogel by one water adsorption cycle. The presence of titania nanoparticles in hydrogel imparts bacteria-resistant properties to the hydrogel (prevent the penetration of bacteria) and antimicrobial properties (the presence of the 2\u20133 mm inhibition zone) against Staphylococcus aureus, which can be used for the development of wound dressing materials.",
