In the normal lungs, proteases maintain their homeostatic functions that regulate processes like its regeneration and repair. Dysregulation of proteases-antiproteases balance is crucial in the manifestation of different types of lung diseases. Chronic inflammatory lung pathologies are associated with a marked increase in protease activities. Thus, in addition to protease activities, inhibition of anti-proteolytic control mechanisms are also important for effective microbial infection and inflammation in the lung. Herein, we briefly summarize the role of different proteases and to some extent antiproteases in regulating a variety of lung diseases.",

Administration of the oxidant, tert-butylhydroperoxide (tert-buOOH) to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs causes pulmonary vasospasm [16] . Oxidant-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction can be blocked by the cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthase inhibitor, indomethacin and is closely correlated with the thromboxane level in the effluent perfusate [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] , suggesting a critical role of thromboxane in pulmonary vasoconstriction. On the other hand, TMB-8, an intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) antagonists, has been shown to prevent oxidant-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction [13] . Thus, oxidant-mediated PAH is triggered by an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i . In many occasions PAH occur due to an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i caused by stimulants such as thromboxane A 2 and endothelin-1 that generates oxidants. Oxidant and Ca 2 + ionophore-mediated pulmonary hypertension has been observed to be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, for example, aprotinin [19] [20] [21] .",

            "text": "The mechanism by which oxidants stimulate production of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites has gained considerable interest. A report by Chakraborti et al. [22] indicated that oxidants, e.g., tert-buOOH stimulation of pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells caused a marked increase in phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) activity with subsequent generation of AA. Mepacrine, an inhibitor of PLA 2 inhibits tert-buOOH-induced increase in PLA 2 activity, thromboxane B 2 production, and PAH [19, 22] . Some investigators, considering the analogy of activation of pancreatic phospholipase A 2 [23] , suggested that a serine protease might be involved in regulating PLA 2 activity [24] . Chakraborti et al. [25, 26] demonstrated that oxidant-mediated activation of PLA 2 activity in pulmonary endothelial and smooth muscle cells occur with the involvement of proteolytically activated protein kinase Ca (PKCa). They have also demonstrated that oxidants caused increase in [Ca 2+ ] i in pulmonary endothelial and smooth muscle cells can activate an aprotinin sensitive protease having mol mass of *43 kDa [26] . The protease then proteolytically activates PKCa resulting in stimulation of cPLA 2 ( Fig. 1) , which generates thromboxane and that has been observed to be important in producing PAH [25, 26] . Oxidants elicit an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i due to proteolytic activation of Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the underlying mechanism associated with oxidant (reactive oxygen species: ROS)-mediated cPLA 2 activation in pulmonary vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells.

(Taken from Mol Cell Biochem. 280: 107-117 with permission) to the Ca 2+ pump, Na + dependent Ca 2+ uptake system is an important mechanism to sequester Ca 2+ in the ER of pulmonary vascular cells [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . A decrease in Ca 2+ sequestration by proteolytic inhibition of Na + dependent Ca 2+ uptake has been observed to measure duration of free [Ca 2+ ] i transient, which eventually produces vasoconstriction [34, 35] . In different systems, Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger controls the contractility of smooth muscle cells [34, 35] . For example, contractile dysregulation in the myocardium could be related with activation of proteases [36] . Thus, the role of cell membrane associated aprotinin sensitive protease and ER MMP-2 on Na + / Ca 2+ exchange in pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells under oxidant triggered condition is an important mechanism for the pathological manifestation of pulmonary vasoconstriction [24] [25] [26] [29] [30] [31] ].",

ECM degradation occurs by different proteases of which matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) has been shown to play the crucial role [37, 38] . Of the MMPs, MMP-2, and MMP-9 are able to cleave basement membrane associated type IV collagen, which increase remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature in PAH [39] .

It has been observed that the activation of proMMP-2 occurs at the cell membrane. Interaction between MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 is an important phenomenon in the activation of proMMP-2. The MT1MMP-TIMP2 associates with proMMP-2 and forms a trimolecular complex, which triggers the activation of proMMP-2 and subsequently generates MMP-2 [41, 42] . The activation of proMMP-2 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells occur with the involvement of protein kinase C-a dependent and NF-\u043aB-MT1MMP-mediated signaling mechanism. TNF-a augments mRNA and protein expression of MT1MMP, while the expression level of TIMP-2 diminishes. The increase in TNF-a leads to IKK activation, IB phosphorylation and degradation, and subsequently activation of NF-\u043aB. Upon activation, NF-\u043aB binds to the MT1-MMP promoter, thereby enhancing its expression and subsequently increases proMMP-2 level in association with TIMP-2 that is modulated by protein kinase C-a at the cell membrane [41, 42] (Fig. 3 ). This indicates therapeutic potentiality of PKC inhibitors in ameliorating the PAH, where activation of proMMP-2 is an important phenomenon.",

TNF-a was shown to inhibit aprotinin and TIMP-1 mRNA and protein expression, which trigger activation of proMMP-2 resulting in the stimulation of MMP-2 (Fig. 4) . Under IL-1b stimulation, the aprotinin sensitive protease was not activated, although a discernible inhibition of TIMP-2 mRNA and protein expression were triggered by TNF-a [42]. Thus, IL-1-induced stimulation of the two progelatinases occurs via different mechanisms. Fig. 3 Schematic representation of TNFa-induced proMMP-2 activation in the SMCs. TNFa binds to cell surface receptor TNFR1. Upon binding, TNFa induces PKCa activation, which subsequently activates IKK by phosphorylation. Activated IKK then phosphorylates IkB-a, which upon phosphorylation is ubiquitinated and degraded in the cytosol. The free NF-\u043aB then translocates to the nucleus and increases the expression of MT1-MMP, which then accumulates on the cell surface. PKC-a, on the other hand, also down regulates TIMP-2 expression by mechanism that is currently unknown. Influenza viruses are highly infectious and trigger acute respiratory diseases with significant morbidity and mortality in humans and other animals [43] [44] [45] [46] .",

In severe asthma, conditions associated with increased airway neutrophilia, tissue damage and an increase in apoptosis of airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells have also been demonstrated [154] . Granzymes, a family of serine protease, have a repute to initiate immune-mediated cell death. Cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) via granzyme-mediated pathway induces apoptosis of target cells, e.g., bronchial epithelial cells. Granzymes play critical roles in a variety of age-related chronic inflammatory diseases. There are five human granzymes identified so far in the lungs. These are granzyme A (GzmA-tryptase), granzyme B (GzmB-aspase), granzyme H (GzmH-chymase), granzyme K (GzmK-tryptase), and granzyme M (GzmM-metase). Granzymes, especially granzyme B and perforin, are stored in secretory granules of cytotoxic cells, and are released into the intercellular space following adhesion to the target cells. In presence of Ca 2+ , perforin pores in the cell membrane enable entry of granzyme B and subsequently induces caspase-dependent apoptosis [155] , which may be an important mechanism of lung injury in asthma.",

Asthmatic patients allergic to pollen have been observed to develop a chronic inflammation of the airways leading to bronchial obstruction and hyper responsiveness. Upon inhalation, pollen grains release a wide variety of allergens with protease activities, which may act as inflammatory mediators and subsequently pathogenesis of respiratory allergies. The proteases were known to inactivate lung regulatory neuropeptides, for example, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) [164] leading to dysregulation of the contraction-relaxation rhythm of the respiratory airways. The inhaled allergens were processed by dendritic cells (DCs) present at the subepithelial regions, and then present allergen peptides to native T-lymphocytes for stimulation of IgE production. Some pollen allergens exhibit proteases such as aminopeptidase and trypsin-like serine protease activities, which can cleave proteins from junctional complexes between epithelial cells [165] . A 98 kDa aminopeptidase of Parietaria judaica, for instance, has been shown to cause detachment of A549 human alveolar epithelial cells by degrading intercellular adhesion proteins from tight junctions and adherens junctions [165, 166] . Pollen proteases can induce degradation of cell junction proteins such as occluding, claudin-1 and E-cadherin, thereby help allergens to cross the epithelial barrier and contact with DCs for intensifying immune response [164] [165] [166] .",

In lung epithelial cells, actions of fungal, cockroach and dust mite allergen proteases are mediated by the cleavage and activation of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) [174] [175] [176] . However, PAR-1 is unable to mediate the effects of these proteases. PARS play an important role in bronchial fibroblast proliferation; epithelial cell wound healing and hypersecretion of mucus [177, 178] . By inhibiting HDE proteases or abrogating activation of epithelial cells, PAR-2 could inhibit HDE-induced inflammatory indexes in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) and subsequently inhibition of the allergic response [179] .

Homologues of HtrA were found in a wide range of bacteria and in eukaryotes. Till date, four human homologues of the bacterial serine protease HtrA have been described, which are named as HtrA-1, -2, -3, and -4 [196, 197] . They have a variety of functions including cancer [198] . HtrA1 has been observed to be downregulated in lung cancers [198] . In human cancer cells, HtrA1 over expression prevents cancer cell growth and proliferation suggesting HtrA1 as a tumor suppressor. A modest expression of HtrA1 has been observed in primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, the exact functions of HtrA1 in cancer are mostly unknown. A previous report suggested that HtrA1 elicits its function by inhibiting TGF-b pathway [199] . The role of TGF-b in cancer progression is well documented [200] . Accordingly, the TGF-b signaling pathway has been considered as both a tumor suppressor and promoter pathway of tumor progression and invasion. It, therefore, seems probable that activation of TGF-b signaling pathway occurs when HtrA1 is downregulated, thereby contributing to the cancer progression. Alternatively, over expression of HtrA1 has been shown to induce apoptosis [201] . Thus, loss of HtrA1 expression alters regulation of apoptosis and could lead to cancer progression [201] .",

ARDS is characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells and severe hypoxia that leads to pulmonary edema [226] . Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed to play a critical role in SARS. In animal studies, a prominent role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the pathogenesis of ARDS has been suggested [227, 228] . ACE2, a homologue of ACE, was shown to be a key regulator for coronovirus infection that produces SARS. ACE2 has been shown to be expressed in the lungs of both healthy and diseased humans, and it protects against SARS-induced ALI [229] [230] [231] . Therefore, it seems conceivable that ACE2 might prove a novel therapeutic target for SARS-coronovirus-induced ARDS that develops in emerging lung infectious diseases including influenza [231] .",

The cleavage of elafin by 20S proteosome suggests that the increment of antiprotease levels in ALI patients could prove clinically beneficial in attenuating uncontrolled activity of NE. Elafin's multifunctional properties could prove useful as the therapeutic target for ALI [239] [240] [241] .",

Granzyme A has originally been thought to induce caspase-independent cell death; however, recent findings suggest that granzyme A may be involved in immune regulation of age-related lung disorders [249, 250] . In contrast, granzyme B induces apoptosis through caspase-dependent and -independent pathways [251] . An increase in granzyme A and B activities is known to promote generation of proinflammatory cytokines. ECM degradation and formation of autoantigens may exacerbate the inflammatory response [251] . Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of age-related cardiovascular and lung diseases. Thus, granzyme A and B may serve as important agent in promoting a positive feedback cycle that may be common to many persistent age-related disorders [251, 252] .

Additionally, a discernible increase in mRNA and protein expression and also activities of cathepsins-B, -H, -K, -L, and -S have been observed in new borne BPD tracheal aspirates [273] . BAL fluid of newborn preterm infants with BPD showed elevation of MMP-9 and a decrease in free TIMP-1 level [274, 275] .",

In contrast, cleavage of elafin by P. aeruginosa proteases may inactivate its antiprotease activity [325] . To overcome the unwanted proteolysis of antiproteases, encapsulations of protease inhibitors within liposomes have been suggested [326] . Aerosol delivery of liposomes entrapped antiproteases may prove useful since it has several features such as sustained release and relatively high loading capacities. NE has been chosen as a target for inhibition by synthetic compounds because it is a widely recognized serine protease, which has been shown to be associated with a variety of lung diseases including CF [327] . DX-890, a small protein inhibitor of NE, has been observed to be tolerable in rats and humans after phase 1 clinical trial [328] . This compound was shown to be involved in IL-8 release from CF neutrophils and to reduce neutrophil transmigration through the epithelial barrier. Outcome of phase 3 clinical trials will reveal the usefulness of DX-890 as a therapeutic measure for a variety of lung diseases.",

B\u00f6ttcher et al.[62]  demonstrated that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D, transmembrane serineproteases, (a.k.a. human airway trypsin-like protease: HAT) activate the influenza viruses H1N1 (A/Memphis/14/96), H2N9 (A/Mallard/Alberta/205/98), and H3N2 (A/Texas/6/96) upon cleavage of haemagglutinin (HA) and contribute to the high pathogenicity of these influenza viruses in the lung [63]. In addition to HAT, TMPRSS-2 and -4, the granzymes (Gzm) such as GzmA, GzmB, and GzmE are known to play a key role in the process of cleavage of 1918 H1N1 HA as a part of the progression of the influenza disease [62, 63]. The sites of virus replication in the microenvironments of respiratory tract represent complex extracellular proteases (such as trypsin and tryptase), which activate a family of receptors called protease activated receptors (PARs) [64, 65] and that play an important role in both virus replication and innate immune response [58, 66]. Four PARs (PAR1-4) are known to be activated by different proteases. After cleavage of the receptor(s) by proteases, the newly released amino terminal sequence binds and internally activates the receptor [67]. In the airways of IAV-infected mice, an increase in the level PAR2 upon IFNc-mediated modulation has been shown to play a crucial role in influenza pathology [68, 69]. Multiple serine protease activities are implicated in mediating influenza virus infection. Inhibition of influenza A virus infection in cultured lung epithelial cells by serine protease inhibitors, for example, aprotinin markedly protects mice from infection [70]. Another serine protease inhibitor, camostat has also been shown to possess anti-influenza (Taiwan/1/86) virus pathology [71].",
