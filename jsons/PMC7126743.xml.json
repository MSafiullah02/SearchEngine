Among those drawn much attention is one that involves membrane technology\u2014the so called membrane based total heat recovery (MTHR) [4], [5], [6], [7]. MTHR is an air-to-air heat exchanger where the two incoming streams (fresh air and exhaust air) exchanges heat and moisture simultaneously through membranes. The fresh air represents outdoor air (fresh air intake for a HVAC system). The exhaust air represents stale room air that would normally be exhausted to the outside. The core material of an MTHR ventilator are vapor-permeable membranes, therefore both heat and moisture are transferred between these two air streams when they flow through the unit. Thus, heat and humidity would be recovered from the exhaust stream in winter and excess heat and moisture would be transferred to the exhaust in order to cool and dehumidify the incoming air in summer. In this way, large quantities of energy in HVAC could be saved.",

Some big cavities in the support layers are also observed, which are presumed to be imperfections in membrane fabrications. However, they have no adverse effects for this study because during operation, they will be filled with liquid solution. In the preparation process, some thickness of the CA membrane is dissolved by the glue, resulting in a lesser support layer thickness than raw material. Fig. 5 with LiCl solution shows that the CA layer and PVDF layer connect to each other very closely and have a dense and continuum interface. There are more big cavities in the support layer. The reason behind this may be that with LiCl solution soaked, the wetted molecular chains in CA membrane structure become more flexible and they will swell and expand to two sides. The boundaries between different layers are pressed together and linked to each other closely. The final CA layer thickness is 52 \u03bcm.",

When testing, the flat sheet membrane is placed on the lower chamber inside which saturated salt solution is contained. The cap is then covered on the membrane surface and forms a sandwiched structure. The membrane and the inner surface of the cap form a cone-shaped cavity. The air is supplied through the air slits in the cap. It is introduced through two diametrically positioned inlets (symmetrically placed) into a circular-shaped channel at the perimeter, from where the air is distributed over the membrane surface through the circular air slit. The air flows inward radially, until it exits the cap outlet in the center. The cap is designed that a constant axial air velocity is realized. When flowing across the membrane, the air stream exchanges moisture with the salt solution through the composite SLM, and is humidified. This test uses NaCl solution since it can ensure outlet humidity not saturated, for the protection of RH sensors.",

The humidity of the mixed air stream is controlled by adjusting the proportions of air mixing. The air flow rates are controlled by two air pumps/controllers at the inlet and outlet of the cell. The humidities and temperatures to and from the cell are measured by the built-in RH and temperature sensors, which are installed in the pumps/controllers.

As seen, the current cell fluid dynamics has a relatively larger convective moisture transfer resistance, accounting for 23% of the total resistance. The two protective layers account for 28% of the total resistance each. The air gap diffusion resistance amounts to less than 10% of the total resistance. The supported liquid layer, LiCl solution layer, only accounts for 12% of the total resistance. In real applications in MTHR ventilators, only membrane resistance and convective resistance are considered. As a result, to further improve performances in future, the resistances in protective layers and flow channels should be lowered as a priority. One efficient measure may be to lower the thickness of protective layers-to a dozen micrometers, for instance. Using turbulent flow arrangement such as cross-corrugated parallel plates may be the good way to lower resistance in flow channels.",
