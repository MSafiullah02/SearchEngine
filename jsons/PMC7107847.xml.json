The 2 envelope glycoproteins are important targets of neutralizing antibody [5]. Hemagglutinin (H) initiates infectivity by binding to cellular sialic acid residues and neuraminidase (N) protein cleaves newly synthesized virus from sialic acid on cell surfaces allowing spread of virus to adjacent cells. At least 16 antigenically distinct hemagglutinin (H1\u2013H16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1\u2013N9) molecules of influenza A have been identified. H1\u2013H3 viruses cause most cases of human disease, whereas the others generally are pathogens of aquatic birds and other mammals. Antigenic variation in H and N contributes to the epidemic nature of influenza by 2 mechanisms. Antigenic \u201cdrift\u201d is due to minor changes in neutralizing epitopes of H and results in epidemics and necessitates annual adjustment of vaccine formulations. Antigenic \u201cshift\u201d occurs when 2 influenza A viruses exchange H or N genes during infection of the same host. Shifts with resultant influenza pandemics occurred in 1918 (H1N1 virus), 1957 (H2N2 virus), and 1968 (H3N2 virus).",

Influenza is efficiently transmitted via small particle aerosols generated by coughing and sneezing and has a 2\u20133-day incubation period, which facilitates explosive outbreaks in closed settings, such as nursing homes (table 2). Since 1977, H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses have circulated, with epidemics of H3N2 infection causing the greatest morbidity in the elderly population. Older persons may be relatively resistant to severe H1N1 disease because of frequent exposure prior to 1957. The impact of influenza on the elderly population is substantial and is greatest among persons with chronic diseases. It is estimated that at least 63% of the 300,000 influenza-related hospitalizations and 85% of the 36,000 influenza-related deaths in the United States involve persons aged >65 years, a group that constitutes only 10% of the total population [6].",

Among elderly outpatients, cough, fever, and acute onset of illness had only a 30% positive predictive value, in contrast to a positive predictive value of 78% for young adults [7]. In a study of older adults hospitalized with documented influenza, cough was nearly universal, and fever (temperature, >38\u00b0C) was seen in 70% [8]. Fever and altered mental status may be the only signs of influenza pneumonia in older persons with cognitive impairment.

[9] described 4 syndromes: (1) no radiographic pneumonia, (2) viral infection followed by bacterial pneumonia, (3) rapidly progressive diffuse viral pneumonia, and (4) concomitant viral-bacterial pneumonia. Today, pure viral pneumonia is uncommon, perhaps because prior infection and vaccination has induced immunity among older persons, as well as the rarity of rheumatic heart disease. We found that 2%\u20136% of highly vaccinated elderly persons (i.e., >90%) in the community developed influenza each season, of whom 5% had pneumonia. Only 30% of hospitalized patients with influenza have radiographic infiltrates, whereas a equal percentage have findings consistent with congestive heart failure or other diseases [10]. The true incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia during influenza is unknown, largely because there are difficulties involved in accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection. In our recent study [10], bacterial infection was identified in 10% of hospitalized patients with influenza, with only 1 episode of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Dual viral-bacterial infections were more severe than were viral infections alone, as evidence by higher rates of intensive care use and morbidity.",

Two major antigenic groups of RSV (A and B) cause annual winter epidemics of respiratory disease in temperate climates [11].
