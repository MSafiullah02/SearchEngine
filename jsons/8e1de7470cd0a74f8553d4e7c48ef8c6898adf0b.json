These are all covered by the same health system and, in the post-lockdown phase we focus on, all subject to the same social distancing regulations. We find that municipalities with a higher number of cases at the beginning of the period analyzed have a lower rate of diffusion, which cannot be imputed to herd immunity. In particular, there is a robust and strongly significant negative correlation between the estimated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the initial outbreak size, in contrast with the role of R 0 as a predictor of outbreak size. We explore different possible explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that a higher number of cases causes changes of behavior, such as a more strict adoption of social distancing measures among the population, that reduce the spread. This result calls for a transparent, real-time distribution of detailed epidemiological data, as such data affects the behavior of populations in areas affected by the outbreak.",

For this reason, some researchers have put forwards adaptations of the SIR model that account for a threshold in the Note: dot size represent absolute numbers, colors represent cases per one thousand inhabitants. capacity of the health system. 2 Such problems are not specific to Italy, as official data from a number of countries have been questioned.

We take population size from official statistics. We hence consider a discretized version of the continuous SIR model -each period corresponding to a day -and automatically explore the parameter space for \u03b2, \u03b3, and the initial value for I and R, looking for the combination that provides the best fit. 3 Specifically, the goodness of fit is maximized by minimizing the sum of square residuals between the cases count and the sum of the I and R pools sizes. 4 The initial values for the free parameters are set to those calibrated on the entire Lombardy region.

We focus on the per capita number of cases, as we expect any effect to be related to the prevalence of the outbreak -a same number of cases will be perceived in a very different way in Milan or in a small municipality. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the estimated values of R 0 : the mean estimated value is 0.83 (0.85 when weighted on population), while the median is 0.70A strong heterogeneity (which can be partly attributed to statistical noise -several municipalities count only a few cases each) can be observed across municipalities: in what follows, unless differently specified, we trim data by dropping 0.5% of outliers on each side of the distribution of R 0 , hence reducing to 903 municipalities. In only few of these (179) the value of R 0 appears to be larger than the critical threshold of 1: that is, in the vast majority of municipalities, the outbreak is expected to spontaneously extinguish without requiring herd immunity. Table 1 presents the results of the regression analysis. We see a negative and strongly significant relationship between the initial number of cases per one thousand inhabitants and the estimated R 0 (column (1)); this relationship is robust to controlling for population size (column (2)), and to both the absolute number of cases and the inverse of population size (column (3)), i.e., a full interaction model where the the per capita count represents the interaction term (Kronmal, 1993) . The coefficient for the per capita number of cases can be interpreted as the reduction in R 0 resulting from an increase of one case per one thousand individuals in the prevalence of the outbreak. The value of -0.023 observed in column (2), which we consider as our baseline specification, indicates a sizeable effect: for reference, given that the prevalence in Milan as of March 25 was of around 1.7% , the above mentioned result suggests that had it been 2.7% , the average R 0 would have been around 0.88 instead than the observed 0.90.

In the most affected muncipalities in our sample during the period analyzed, 57 infections per one thousand inhabitants have been recorded, and according to the most pessimistic estimates this would mean that up to 57% of the population was infected. While most municipalities have a number of recorded cases per one thousand inhabitants which is orders of magnitude lower, to avoid the possibility that an even partial herd immunity effect might be driving the results, we reestimate our main model on subsamples of municipalities according to their initial number of cases per capita. Specifically, we split the sample according to quartiles of cases per capita on March 25. The results, presented in columns (1) to (4) of Table 2 , show that our findings are not driven by herd immunity, as the coefficient for cases% is negative in each quartile. The absolute value of such coefficient is actually much larger for municipalities with a low prevalence than for those with a higher prevalence, and is strongly significant in the first two quartiles, hence including municipalities with 2 cases per one thousand inhabitants or less.",

More specifically, we can assume that identified and unidentified patients form two different pools of infected subjects and that the latter has a much higher \u03b2 -probability of infecting susceptible individuals -that leads to a corresponding higher R 0 . Since \u03b2 enters linearly in R 0 -and assuming for simplicity that \u03b3 is constant -the relationship between u t \u2212 i t and R 0 would be expected to be linear. Moreover, it is well known that not only identified patients are subject to a stronger form of isolation, but also close contacts of such patient (some of which are not infected) are recommended to selfquarantine: this does not happen in municipalities with a larger number of undetected cases, which implies that the effect of each unidentified patient should be more than linear in increasing the R 0 .

Hence, while this does not allow us to exlude that the other explanations might play a role, we can conclude that the social explanation is the main driver of the negative relationship between cases% and R 0 . (Jones et al., 2020) describes two possible opposite reactions to the COVID-19 oubreak: a precautionary attitude that leads to a stricter adherence to guidelines, and a \"fatalism effect\" according to which an individual who is more likely to be infected in the future \"reduces her incentives to be careful today\".

In accordance with the selection procedure described in Section 3, we reduce this analysis to the 713 municipalities that feature at least one case on March 25 and, in each window, have new cases recorded in at least two dates. The results are shown in Figure 4b . For comparability, we also display the value of the coefficient estimated for the entire time period on the same restricted sample of 713 municipalities. We find that the effect of interest is robust, that is, the coefficient for the cases% is consistently negative and strongly significant for each subperiod. Its absolute value is significantly decreasing over time; that is, the effect of the number of cases on the R 0 in the following days appears to be stronger in the earlier days of the outbreak. While there might be multiple explanations for this, we only remark that the rate of growth of the epidemic has been consistently decreasing: whether individual behavior reacts not just to outbreak size, but also to its change over time, is an issue for further research.",

For each parameter (including the initial values I =\u00ce and R =R), the procedure is initialized by deriving reasonable values based on tuning the model to regional aggregated data.Then the procedure works as follows (i denotes an iteration, \u03b4 \u03c0,1 is set to 0.2 for each parameter \u03c0):",
