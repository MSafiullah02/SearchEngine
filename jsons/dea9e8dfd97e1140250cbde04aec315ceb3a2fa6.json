Participants exposed to dampness or mould at home (OR adj =0.5) were significantly less likely to visit their GP.

Identification of these risk factors may be useful for efforts to interrupt transmission. A multitude of studies have identified various risk factors for ARTI. Studies in developing countries have identified risk factors to be among others crowding, nutritional factors, and parental smoking [12] [13] [14] [15] . Because of major differences in living conditions and environmental circumstances these study outcomes can not directly be extrapolated to industrialised countries. Studies in industrialised countries can roughly be divided into studies addressing children, and studies addressing specific respiratory diseases. Known risk factors for children are for instance young age [16] , environmental tobacco smoke [17, 18] , home-dampness [19, 20] , and attending day-care centres [19, 21, 22] . Risk factors noted in relation with specific respiratory diseases, like asthma, COPD and tuberculosis, are active smoking, low socioeconomic status, occupational exposure and exposure to air pollution [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Patients were classified by the GP's. Inclusion criteria for cases were: consulting GP for acute respiratory complaints, and being diagnosed as influenza-like illnesses (ILI) or another ARTI, and consulting GP for the first time in that episode. Patients were not eligible for inclusion when they reported use of antibiotics or anti-viral medication in the last two weeks. For each case patient a control patient, matched by age group (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and \u2265 65 year), was recruited within 1 week of consultation. Inclusion criterion for controls was a consultation of the GP for complaints other than respiratory. Exclusion criteria were: complaints of an ARTI in the last two weeks, belonging to the same household as the case, and the use of antibiotics or anti-viral medication in the last two weeks. From all participants, 1 nose and 2 throat swabs were obtained during the visit. Furthermore, both cases and controls were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire about potential risk factors. These questionnaires extracted information about exposure to persons with respiratory complaints within or outside their household in the week before consulting the GP, family composition (number of children and adults, presence of children attending day-care, primary school or secondary education), working outside the home and kind of job, use of public transport, type of heating system, exposure to mechanical ventilation system, exposure to dampness or mould at home, keeping pets or cattle, smoking behaviour, and exposure to passive smoking (see Additional file 1). Parents or guardians were asked to complete questionnaires for young children. To assess the burden of the ARTI, the questionnaires of case patients also extracted information about restriction of daily activities, bed rest, and absence from school or work. Moreover, after the first and second year of study all GPs participating in the casecontrol study were asked to complete a questionnaire for each reported case patient. These follow-up questionnaires obtained information about additional consultations, referral to specialists and hospitalisation for the reported episode of ARTI.",

We demonstrated that in the general population (passive) smoking, dampness or mould at home and having family members attending day-care were not associated with a higher risk for ARTI, which is in contrast with studies carried out in children or patients with specific respiratory diseases. The pathogenesis of ARTI involves a complex interplay between pathogens and the host's inflammatory response [1, 11] . This complicated mechanism in combination with a diagnostic deficit of over 30% [7] might account for differences between risk factors found in specific study populations and in the general population.",

Smoking is believed to exacerbate respiratory diseases by harming respiratory defence mechanisms [33] . Nevertheless, in this study smoking or exposure to passive smoking was not a risk factor for consulting a GP with an ARTI nor for consulting with a laboratory-confirmed ARTI. It is possible that, selection bias is part of the explanation for this finding. Smokers might be less inclined to visit a GP with respiratory complaints as compared with non-smokers. Moreover, our findings are based on questionnaire-data about exposure, which are often prone to recall bias. Questionnaires are relatively cheap and easily used, but are likely to be less valid and reliable then the measurement of biomarkers in body fluids for true exposure [34] . Furthermore, awareness of the adverse health effects of passive smoking has increased substantially in the past years because of extensive information. This might have resulted in lower exposure levels, explaining the lack of association with ARTI in the general population. A recent study in school children also concluded that smoking by a care-provider was not significantly associated with respiratory infections [20] .",

It is plausible that day-care centre children would transmit respiratory infections to their family members [41, 42] . Nevertheless, we find that having family members attending day-care, was not associated with a higher risk in the general population for consulting a GP with an ARTI. This might be an underestimation of the real number of patients with an ARTI, because an unknown proportion of subjects with an ARTI will not visit a GP. Selection bias could also play a role, persons with family members attending day-care might be less inclined to visit a GP with respiratory complaints. Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First the study was carried out in a period of moderate influenza-activity, affecting the number of consultations for ILI as well as other ARTI [43] . As a consequence of a limited sample size, risk factors could not be analyzed in relation to the separate pathogens, but only to the entity of ARTI. Secondly, questionnaire data were used to measure exposure to potential risk factors. This could be less reliable compared with observational data. Moreover, heightened attention to the cause of their complaints by patients with an ARTI may have caused recall bias. Thirdly, we cannot rule out the possibility that controls were in the incubation period for an ARTI, even though they had no respiratory complaints. We expect the number of controls developing those infections to be low, because the GP's actively asked for the presence of respiratory symptoms at the moment the nose and throat swabs were taken. Nevertheless, this might have diluted the investigated relations between potential risk factors and ARTI.",

Increasing awareness of the importance of hygienic measures with regard to prevention and control of ARTI will also be useful facing a potential pandemic threat, assuming that the route of transmission of the pandemic virus is similar to that of other respiratory viruses.",
