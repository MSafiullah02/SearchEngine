            "text": "Our human genome developed on the African savanna during pre-history, adapted to increase the likelihood of achieving immediate benefits for a limited group in a relatively short span of time (Wilson, 2012). Human beings are a tribal species, and our perspective remains stubbornly tribal. In the end, the destiny of humanity is tied to the capacity of the human mind. Humans are unique with their penetrating intellect characterized by a deep pool of reflective, self-aware consciousness. Reflective consciousness, along with the propensity for extended attention, provides the basic architecture of the human mind, enabling creativity and problem solving. Our African savanna ancestors and people today share a motivational system outlined by Abraham Maslow (1968). After fulfilling \u201cbasic needs\u201d\u2014 such as food, shelter, and clothing\u2014people move on to try meeting \u201chigher needs\u201d, that includes securing a stable living environment, achieving social recognition, and self-fulfillment. To help meet these higher needs, individuals seek psychological capital\u2014in the form of approval and cooperation from family and peers\u2014to reinforce core strengths toward enabling them to realize greater potential. Pursuing and attaining these goals create mentally healthy, productive, and happy humans. Happiness, in the Greek sense of eudaimonia, is the desirable outcome attained by satisfying one\u2019s multifaceted needs. Pursuing happiness would be a straightforward process, if only rationality was consistently dominant\u2014but it is not (Kahneman, 2011). The power of rational thinking is limited and varies between individuals. It also fluctuates within a given person over time and seems to have a genetic basis that limits its expression (Pinker, 2002). The augmentation of individual power by technology causes flaws in rationality to have amplified consequences. These past three centuries of history demonstrate how easily and instinctively people seize upon technology to enhance self-interest and concerns of their tribal networks. Furthermore, in the same period, we have left a self-indulgent trail of pollution, death and destruction\u2014testimony to a darker side of human nature.",

            "text": "Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common errors humans make (1981). Economist Richard Thaler later collaborated with Kahneman to explore a range of puzzling economic behaviors (1982, 2000). Their collective work spawned the subdisciplines of prospect theory and behavioral economics, confirming Herbert Simon\u2019s insight from the 1950s that human reasoning has certain distorted propensities and limits (i.e. bounded rationality; 1957). Psychologists note that humans display mental mechanisms that not only lower the influence of logic but can also, paradoxically, jeopardize individual and collective security. These mechanisms often helped those humans who lived in simple Paleolithic tribes, when quick decisions fed by emotional response often meant the difference between life and death (Livingstone-Smith, 2011). They include:1Denial: People often refuse to accept unexpected bad outcomes.2Dehumanization: Viewing an outside person or group as subhuman makes it easier to project malicious intent, negating our innate standards of fairness and sense of guilt, making ostracism or violence against them appear justified.3Preconceptions: People often use simplified mental benchmarks and filters (I.e. heuristics) leading them to dismiss new evidence regardless of merit. Confirmation bias perpetuates misunderstandings.4Assumptions: People develop theories of an opponent\u2019s behavior that in turn affects behavioral posturing, increasing tension and misinterpretations.\n",

            "text": "Another relevant issue facing us is the contexts in which humans naturally engage in altruistic behavior. Paleolithic human\u2019s expression of familial or nonfamilial altruism endures for only a couple generations, with concern for future generations subsequently deteriorating (Dawkins, 1989). The fact is there used to be no compelling need for longer-term concern. However, such limiting of intergenerational interest leads to a shorter-term policy horizon than that needed to address today\u2019s global problems. For instance, over the past half-century, western citizens have endorsed rising public indebtedness. Citizens thereby enjoy greater consumption than could be provided out of current income. This boosts positive hedonic sensations (more goods and services consumed today) while reducing negative hedonic sensations (lower taxes paid today) and is reinforced by the basic human predisposition for immediate gratification. However, at some point, any debt, even a public one, must be repaid: Public debt is delayed taxation. At that future point we face a set of conundrums; for as soon as we must repay, we necessarily experience a significant increase in negative hedonic sensations. Given that we dislike losses more than twice as much we like equal gains, we resist, which merely entrenches the unsustainable trends that eventually leads to crisis (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). This insight further helps explain the lack of general concern for damage to the biosphere or humankind\u2019s enduring faith in a \u201ctechnofix\u201d solution\u2014it is easier to brush off emergent problems if you believe that a necessary fix will surely be found when needed by some future generation that you are not too concerned about in the first place.",

            "text": "Finally, research reveals that individuals often behave differently in group contexts than they would if acting alone (i.e. crowd psychology). Within a group setting individuals often take up the group\u2019s identity, ignoring their own conscience, suspending judgment and accountability. The result is that individuals within groups participate in acts they would never commit separately. Social psychologists say that a participant enters a lower state of self-awareness called \u201cdeindividuation\u201d. The resulting anonymity can have horrifically destructive effects on innocent lives and property, as witnessed during riots, genocides and wars (Cantril, 2002). Extending these insights, the anonymity associated with group behaviors coupled with limited future concern helps us to understand why individuals in developed nations can be insensitive to poverty, emigration, environmental destruction, water shortages and excessive debt on the global level. When one adds human flaws to an increasingly crowded planet, effects become amplified\u2014there are over 7 billion of us all behaving much the same way.",

Without a doubt, the powerful, pervasive, and positive effects brought about by Enlightenment thinking and Industrial Revolution propelled civilization to higher states of wealth and welfare. Advances in public health, medicine and agricultural productivity set off exponential growth in population, reinforcing economic progress within a series of positive feedback loops. The historical events represent a transformative tsunami, with all dimensions of civilization and Earth changed forevermore. As the 19th century began Earth was still pristine for humans with their newly minted ideas. There were more unknown places to explore and exploit while human population was low, estimated at being about one billion globally in 1800. Abundant resources were readily available to support industrialization and upsurge in living standards. New technologies arising from scientific research, innovation and commercialization drove the entire enterprise forward. Economists would say the potential for both extensive and intensive economic growth on the global stage was at a maximum back then. Capitalist industries and markets were freer\u2014within the formidable command of enabling, imperial power\u2014to spread across the planet, bringing more and more places, people and resources into the western economic paradigm.",

            "text": "The United Nations projects a further 45% increase in human population, a fact that will have significant consequences. Specifically, the UN projects that global population will grow from 7.7 billion today to about 11.2 billion by 2100 with 95% certainty (2017). Once human population peaks, fertility will gradually fall leading to the population growth pattern moving from its current exponential path to one that is logistic. This pattern has already appeared in developed nations with demographers projecting it to occur in time throughout the less developed world. Human population will level off between 11-12 billion with every reason to believe that population decline will commence in the 22st century as world-wide fertility rates fall below replacement level. Before we make a sigh of collective relief, there are three relevant details to consider. First, most of the additional population growth will occur in the less developed parts of the world, already struggling to pull themselves out of poverty. Second, before human population begins to decline, we and our planet must get through the next 80 years\u2014or more like 150 years or so before our numbers return to even today\u2019s level. Third, the coming 3-4 billion surge in global population will be the largest increase ever in absolute number during any 80-year period in history. While the average annual rate of population growth is decreasing, the number of people born will increase in total number\u2014because each year the base is larger so a decrease in the growth rate can still result in more people being born. Between these considerations lie many risks, all to the downside. Already unprecedented numbers of immigrants are trying to move to the richer, more politically stable parts of the world while sectarian (i.e. tribal) strife within poorer countries becomes more common, with technologically empowered militants and autocrats amplifying their power.",

As the next 3-4 billion people arrive the question of whether this represents unsustainable overpopulation becomes significant. Overpopulation is generally defined as a situation where an organism's numbers exceed the carrying capacity of its habitat. The problem is that the 21 st century will witness, and some would say is already witnessing, a time when Earth\u2014clearly a closed environment\u2014experiences a set of innate and/or human imposed restraints. As limits are reached poorer nations will find themselves in a condition of \"demographic entrapment\"\u2014a condition when a nation has a population more than its carrying capacity without the option of migration, with too little in export earnings to pay for critical imports. The net effect can be localized Malthusian crises with characteristics of mass starvation and sociopolitical instability. Climate change is already cited as making this tendency more probable in Sub-Saharan Africa. In other words, the low-hanging fruit sustaining population growth and prosperity these past 200 years has been plucked\u2014or is being horded\u2014by those fortunate to have industrialized and prospered earlier. The decline of global, westernized civilization as we know it may well be herald by poorer nations fracturing before the crisis spreads to the rest of our global village (Homer-Dixon, 2006).",

It is suggested that our numbers are now so vast, our industry so extensive, that a new geological age has begun: the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2016). This conjecture is rooted not simply in our numbers but in our nature as well: We are 7.7 billion individuals with insatiable collective wants on our way to becoming up to 11-13 billion strong, transforming myriad dimensions of Earth\u2019s hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. One group of scientists has identified limits beyond which we should not push our planet (Stockholm Resilience Centre, 2015). This research suggests we are nearing tipping points into radically different planetary states with unknown ecosystemic features. Earth systems are frustratingly complex, so the results are tentative yet worrying. The bottom line is that planetary boundaries exist and will restrain the current trajectory of civilization. Given the UN\u2019s population growth forecast, we may begin hitting some of these fuzzy planetary boundaries soon. B\u00c1nyai states that environmental regulation has failed, for human behavior is \u201cpsychopathological\u201d (2019). Her analysis supports the conclusion made here that civilization\u2019s decline is inevitable. Even if passing the tipping points move Earth into a still hospitable environment for humans, the transitions involved will magnify the tensions associated within the climatic stage of civilization. All this is symptomatic of human behavior and numbers, representing distinctive features during this phase of civilization\u2019s climax.",

Since Edward Gibbon's extensive work, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, scholars have taken an active interest in what causes the eventual decline of all empires (1776-1788). In the case of Rome, Gibbon suggested decay of the elite was brought on by the \u201cnatural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness\u201d. Arnold Toynbee refined Gibbon\u2019s ideas by adding that the political elite became increasingly parasitic, leading to an increasingly marginalized majority who undermine the integrity of empire in numerous ways (1939). Other macrohistorians, such as Oswald Spengler, argue for a world view based on the cyclical rise and decline of civilizations, suggesting we have begun a centuries-long process of decline mirroring that witnessed in antiquity (1926). Joseph Tainter\u2019s study of Rome identified increased sociopolitical complexity\u2014causing rigidity and fragility while drawing off scarce resources\u2014as a major cause of its decline, with many suggesting his insights relevant today (1988). For many ancient, albeit smaller, civilizations, Jared Diamond suggests a quintet of external factors led to decline: environmental degradation, climate change, dependency upon external trade, intensifying levels of internal and external violence and, finally, societal responses\u2014or lack of response\u2014to all these factors (2005). For modern civilization\u2014and this was likely true for many ancient ones as well\u2014Mancur Olson argued that special interest groups accumulate around the central power structure, drawing off resources, impeding the ability of central authorities to respond appropriately to the growing threats to the integrity of empire (1982). One final point found in all these studies is that leaders essentially failed to deal with developing, macro-problems, both internal and external, before reaching the threshold of crisis and impending collapse.",

A further ambition of this work was to produce a comparative and integrative history of the patterns and causes of change throughout time. They begin deep in the past with the premodern insights of Ssu-Ma Ch'ien, Augustine and Ibn Khaldun; progressing to 19th century contributions of such dialectical thinkers as Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx; ending with the more recent thinking of Pitirim Sorokin, Prabhat Sarkar and contributors to the Gaia hypothesis. This sweeping set of transhistorical and cross-cultural perspectives of social change are then treated comparatively, resulting in the definition of twelve different \"sciences\" addressing change in the human condition. These \u201csciences\u201d reflect diverse pedagogical perspectives on the study of civilizational change, each focusing on distinct forces, patterns and units of analysis (i.e. vectors of change). Reflecting what has been previously noted, Galtung and Inayatullah identify \u201cstages and patterns\u201d in the cyclical development of civilizations as a common theme among the macrohistorians reviewed. Inclusion of non-Western thinkers infuses the work with a rich set of historical experiences and perspectives while providing us with analytical tools to help understand on multiple levels what is happening within western civilization today.",

More recently, the Ehrlichs wrote a piece entitled \u201cCan a collapse of global civilization be avoided?\u201d (Ehrlich & Ehrlich, 2013). They begin by stating that \u201cglobal collapse appears likely\u201d due to overpopulation and overconsumption with dramatic cultural change necessary to avert catastrophe. Laura Spinny published a summary of additional corroborating research all pointing to socioeconomic disintegration, concluding that \u201calmost nobody thinks the outlook for the West is good\u201d (New Scientist, 2018). Lastly, Luke Kemp, from the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, published a BBC report noting that \u201ccollapse may be a normal phenomenon for civilizations, regardless of their size and technological stage\u201d, and that \u201cour tightly-coupled, globalized economic system is, if anything, more likely to make crisis spread\u201d (Kemp, 2019).",

To many it requires a maintainable level of the physical components providing a healthy standard of living for all, consistent with viable ecosystemic balance. Such a standard of living would require ready access to the basics of nutrition, clothing and shelter. In addition, it would require equal entry to the higher reaches of the Maslow hierarchy through provision of a stable environment, basic health care and education, as well as minimal socioeconomic barriers to advancement within a strong legal system. Providing such would guarantee equal opportunity to everyone toward achieving aspirations compatible with innate, or acquired, abilities and drive. In other words, the sustainable population size requires something more than mere survival of our species, since a healthy civilization requires dynamic engagement of, and opportunities for, its members. If the researchers at the Stockholm Resilience Center are correct in stating that Earth will be moving into a profoundly altered state in coming decades, then Earth\u2019s carrying capacity for humanity at any future time is indeterminable today. This has not stopped prognosticators from making estimates based on our planet\u2019s current ecosystemic state. Paul Ehrich places the optimal population of the planet between 1.5 and 2 billion people (The Guardian, 2012). Unfortunately, most research on the subject varies so much as to be currently useless. The reason for such disparate conclusions distills down to the underlying assumptions made by those doing the research\u2014and this too can become victim of partisan, tribal truth. There are those that believe that human adaptability and ingenuity places no limit on human population size while others derive a number less than that suggested by Ehrlich. Further research is needed, and, in the end, the sustainable population range determined requires balancing the carrying capacity of Earth by ecological footprint analysis with some minimum scale required to maintain humanity\u2019s diversity within a transformed, vibrant civilization design.",

The first part is true and, as to the second part, there are implications arising from this multi-decade policy that will negatively impact China\u2019s future economic growth, which is construed as a bad outcome. This last conclusion arises from the questionable assumption that aggregate economic growth is something we should always strive for. What really matters is a nation\u2019s \u201chuman development\u201d level over time. The fact is that it\u2019s not bad to experience stagnant or negative GDP growth if real per capita human development, as defined by the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index, remains positive (United Nations, 2019). This is the trick public policy makers need investigate and then achieve. Population decline in the context of robust technologically driven productivity gains is one avenue toward achieving this goal (Frey, 2019). B\u00fcchs and Koch have investigated the degrowth transition, finding that wellbeing need not suffer (2019). However, they note that the psychological transition in expectations will not be easy. Echoing this concern, Fergnani underscores the difficulty in disentangling the instilled psychological pleasure individuals gain as participants in capitalism (2019). The coordinated cadence of human effort born of the Industrial Revolution created a psychosocial dynamic that will prove deeply resistant to paradigmatic change. This too requires careful research, but an inescapable conclusion is that it is crucial to modify our inculcated beliefs concerning economic growth.",

Protection of your person and your family, the freedom to live your life without excessive social hindrance and the right to pursue happiness, all resonate with basic human nature. James Q.

Some nations will disappear (e.g. the Maldives) while others may be relatively untouched (e.g. New Zealand). Global supply chains will be disrupted and trade impaired, with the overhang of debt and defaults causing financial market disruption and global GDP to stagnate or turn negative. Public policy initiatives will be constrained by past excesses. Unmet expectations of citizens in the developed world will lead to idiosyncratic social and political instability.

First, the global financial system shifted from a debit to a credit basis in the early 1970s. This has permitted an historic increase of debts relative to assets. Debt is essentially borrowing against future income, boosting growth and consumption temporarily in the current region of time.

These efforts entail pumping liquidity into markets through central bank purchases of various private and public financial instruments. The net effect is to transfer more of the accelerating debt burden from the private to public sectors. Along with this, some predict that the United States may run annual fiscal deficits in both 2020 and 2021 of over 3 trillion dollars, at a rate that may approach 18% of GDP.

This fed the process of creative destruction, fueling economic dynamism and growth. All technology cycles follow a similar logistic growth curve, eventually succumbing to what economic growth theorists call \u201cthe fishing out effect\u201d. The most profitable applications are developed early, leaving a diminishing number of related, or nested, innovations and inventions for later commercial exploitation. While at first the cycle causes an acceleration in productivity, this effect diminishes until the rate of innovation falls back to some baseline rate (Gordon, 2016). There is no doubt we are on the tail-end of the computer chip cycle, reflected in the 1.1% average productivity gains experienced since the Great Recession ended in 2009 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017). Undoubtedly there will be some new technology cycle, yet timing is unpredictable, with the nature of the next cycle not necessarily the same as that witnessed in the past. For instance, a new cycle based on bioengineering may enhance the quality of life for humans but may not entail as potent \u201cgales of creative destruction\u201d in the economy as before. Further, in the beginning it\u2019s the privileged who will reap the benefits in such a cycle\u2014for they can afford the enhancing treatments\u2014contributing to inequality, increasing the odds that these enhanced humans enter the lifeboats as the ship of civilization sinks. All this has yet to be written, yet we are on the downward slope; already in the stage of senescence with collapse and decay temporarily deferred.",

Like the air we breathe, endogenous earth systems operate with invisible hands we cannot see or appreciate. Sustainability for Homo sapiens requires that we avoid two controllable causes of past species extinction: habitat degradation and predacious competition. Human niches now span the entire planet; therefore, the health of global ecological systems becomes of relevant concern. Habitat degradation, the main cause of past species extinctions, can be caused by natural or, in the case of humanity, induced shifts in the atmosphere and biosphere. The deleterious effects manifest as environmental disruption and/or reduction in available resources for members of our species as well as other life forms. Kareiva and Carranza observe that Earth\u2019s systems are presently raising the existential risk of ecosystemic collapse (2018). Predacious competition, another cause of extinction, historically has come from inter-species competition within the Darwinian dynamic. Given the uniqueness of the human life form, today it comes in the form of inner-species competition within geopolitical contexts and power dynamics (e.g. witness Syria this past decade). This century\u2019s most significant fallacy is that actions that once made perfect sense for the individual, when multiplied by our growing numbers, are producing formidable forces contributing to the decline of western civilization. Both habitat degradation and inner-species competition during the early Anthropocene is caused by our numbers and behavior. This suggests that we need to reduce the first and restrain the second. While these are necessary conditions, doing so is beyond the capacity of humanity to achieve within the existing paradigm of civilization.",

The most significant artifact of humanity is knowledge, which has a unique property: Once created, knowledge cannot be destroyed, and ones use of it does not diminish what is available to others in perpetuity. There are simply hordes of academics, scientists and other information workers crawling along the surface of an ever-expanding body of knowledge, peering through their methodological microscopes, relentlessly contributing new facts, insights and theories. We have much to draw upon in seeking answers to the questions posed in this article, yet there is a growing and critical need for a fresh directional focus. While many of us have been told that the meek shall inherit the Earth, this was likely just a cleaver byline to bring the poor and powerless into the arms of the early Christian church. Since the first civilization emerged in the Middle East, it has always been the powerful amongst us who have shaped history. It will soon be time for a few of them to do so again, but this time in a way that serves not only themselves and their children, but also humanity\u2019s collective future.",
