            "text": "Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in China and eventually declared as a pandemic as the virus spread globally. Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients. We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020. All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion. Results Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period. Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. Conclusions COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.",

The COVID-19 status was unknown for all patients before surgery. All patients developed postoperative fever and pulmonary complications after uneventful operations. Two of the three patients had COVID-19 confirmed by a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Of these two COVID-19 postoperatively confirmed patients, one died due to acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure (MOF). The remaining patient was clinically diagnosed and died due to the postoperative progressive course of COVID-19 infection. An additional patient suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) one day before his scheduled bariatric surgery, and rapidly progressed to cardiopulmonary arrest. PCR was not performed due to rapid deterioration and insufficient testing capacity.",

As chemoembolization-associated sterile inflammation was suspected, cephalosporin antibiotic was initiated. In the following days, liver transplant surgery was performed, and immunosuppressive drugs were prescribed. Due to persistent fever and a suspected chest computed tomography (CT), RT-PCR was obtained and confirmed positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 was finally negative on postoperative day (POD) 49, and the patient was discharged from the hospital two months after his surgery.",

Reviewing their data, a potential COVID-19 perioperative carrier was identified. This patient had localized ground glass on CT imaging, was misdiagnosed before surgery, and his fever elevated only on POD1. On POD 3, his CT scan already revealed severe COVID-19 infection. On POD 5, the patient died. During his hospital stay, six health care staff members and five postoperational patients were exposed and found to have a positive nucleic test for COVID-19. As mortality rate was significantly high in postoperative patients (5/13), the authors show that chest surgery was significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Moreover, they demonstrate that age and COPD were significantly associated with a severe presentation and finally death from COVID-19.",
