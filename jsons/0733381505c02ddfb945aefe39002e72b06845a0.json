As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses depend on cellular cofactors, and in that sense, a definition of the \"infectious particle\" would include not just the virally encoded proteins but also the cellular proteins that enable replication to occur. Moreover, the cellular tools that are available to the virus will depend on cell type, cell cycle status, differentiation state, and extracellular mediators that may influence metabolism (e.g., cytokines and hormones). Such differences may affect how the virus replicates and spreads. For example, certain cell types may be able to alter viral replication in an effort to limit the cytopathicity that might otherwise result from an unrestricted infection. Recent evidence indicates that central nervous system (CNS) neurons possess survival skills that influence the replication of neurotropic RNA viruses and moderate the activity of the resulting antiviral response.",

Collectively, these properties of the CNS contribute to an \"immune privileged\" environment under normal conditions. Nevertheless, activated T lymphocytes patrol the CNS parenchyma [5, 6] and are recruited into the brain after infection by many neurotropic viruses [7] [8] [9] . In some circumstances, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, such inflammatory responses are associated with marked CNS damage [8] . In others the immune response is able to resolve an infection without apparent damage to the host (e.g., the immune-mediated clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) [10] . These data suggest that the CNS has unique strategies to recruit the immune response following a pathogenic challenge and to promote clearance mechanisms that prevent or limit immunopathology. Understanding how these defenses work and how chronic CNS disease occurs when they fail is of paramount importance in the development of appropriate therapies to prevent or reverse virus-induced neuropathology.",

Chemokines are a superfamily of small secreted proteins that promote recruitment of leukocytes to the site of a pathogenic challenge by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors [11, 12] . Such engagement results in leukocyte activation and increased adhesion to capillary endothelia. In the brain, infection by a number of viruses has been correlated with a rapid and robust induction of chemokines from multiple resident cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, specific chemokine neutralizing antibodies and knockout mice have been valuable tools in demonstrating the crucial role chemokines play in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS. For example, Lane et al. [15] showed that administration of RANTES neutralizing antisera to C57BL/6 mice infected with neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) reduced macrophage accumulation and resultant demyelination as compared with control mice, implicating a protective role for RANTES in this model system.",

To address this issue, we used a transgenic mouse model in which viral infection was restricted to CNS neurons. In this system, a human measles virus (MV) receptor, CD46, was expressed specifically in CNS neurons under the transcriptional control of the rat neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter [18] . NSE-CD46 transgenic mice supported infection by MV-Edmonston and adult mice mounted aggressive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses that protected them from neurologic impairment and death [19] . We recently showed that MV challenge of NSE-CD46 \u03e9 mice results in a potent induction of T cell-recruiting chemokines in infected neurons. We used RNAse protection assays to show induced expression of the chemokines IP-10 and RANTES in infected adult brains and in infected primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Confocal microscopy studies further demonstrated that viral antigens and chemokines colocalize in infected neurons (unpublished data). In vivo depletion of IP-10, RANTES, and monokine-induced interferon (IFN)-g from immunocompetent adult mice reduced the infiltration of T cells in infected mouse brains by up to 60% and was correlated with increased neuronal MV infection. Thus, these studies suggest that neurons may play a crucial and early role in the host response to infection by triggering the rapid production of chemokines that help to alert and focus the antiviral response to the infected CNS.",

Subsequently, Guidotti and colleagues [21, 22] , by using transgenic mice that expressed the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome in hepatocytes, showed that CTL-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IFN-g noncytolytically inhibited HBV replication [21, 22] .",

Thus, their loss by a lytic immune response could be as deleterious to the host as the viral infection itself. Indeed, data from multiple laboratories suggest that the host response can mediate viral clearance from the CNS via noncytolytic strategies. For example, immune-mediated clearance of a persistent LCMV infection within the CNS is noncytopathic [3, 10] and requires the presence of T cell-elaborated cytokines such as IFN-g [23] . Other viruses with similar dependence on noncytolytic clearance are Sindbis [7] , MHV [24, 25] , vesicular stomatitis [26] [27] [28] , and MV [29, 30] .",

Whether the same pathways that are activated by type I and II IFN to induce an antiviral state are also involved in the clearance of an established viral infection is an area of intense investigation. Monocyte/macrophage-elaborated cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 are also involved in the resolution of viral infections. Not only does IL-12 skew the T helper response toward a Th1 profile, it can directly promote noncytopathic recovery from neurotropic infection by regulating nitric oxide synthesis [26, 28, 38] . Thus, cytokines contribute to viral clearance directly (by inhibiting virus replication) and indirectly (e.g., by inducing other inflammatory cytokines). Defining the cellular pathways that result in viral loss without concomitant neuronal death and establishing which factors govern how the host response \"chooses\" between cytopathic and noncytopathic effector mechanisms are major research areas in neurovirology and neuroimmunology.",

In neurons, MV spread occurs in the absence of extracellular virus, syncytia formation, or neuronal lysis. Decreased virus production correlates with an inability of MV to form buds at the neuronal plasma membrane [42] . MV transmission throughout these neuron cultures is not inhibited by neutralizing antibodies, paralleling rabies studies in which neutralizing antibodies are less effective in preventing spread in neurons than in nonneuronal cells [43] . Together, these data indicate a novel mechanism of MV transmission in neurons [42, 44] .

Thus, while neurons may place restrictions on viral replication to limit cytopathicity, viruses may in turn encode proteins that facilitate neuronal transport. Of interest, while the CD46 receptor is required for initial MV entry in the NSE-CD46 transgenic system, it is not needed for subsequent neuron-neuron spread [42] . The lack of requirement for CD46 may mean that the hemagglutinin protein that interacts with the cellular receptor may also be dispensable for neuronal infection, although for other RNA viruses that spread via the synapse, such as rabies, a requirement for the viral surface proteins was noted [49] .",

Often the outcome of infection with neurotropic RNA viruses differs depending on the age of the infected host (e.g., intracerebral infection of neonatal mice with LCMV results in a lifelong infection, whereas a similar infection of adults is lethal [41] ). The opposite occurs in NSE-CD46 transgenic mice after MV infection: Infection of neonates is lethal but infection of adults results in viral clearance [18, 19] . In both cases, the differential outcome of infection is due to immunologic differences: In the LCMVinfected adult mice, for example, death is due to a vigorous CTL response that results in choriomeningitis, edema, and mortality [41] . However, age-related differences in response to viral infection may also be due to the differentiated status of the infected neuron [51] . For example, infection of mouse neurons with the A7(74) strain of Semliki Forest virus causes mortality in neonatal animals but not in adults due to the inability of virus to bud from adult neurons [52, 53] . While the exact nature of this abortive infection remains under study, the metabolism of rapidly dividing neurons differs substantially from that of fully differentiated nondividing neurons. Differences such as axonogenesis and myelination likely have a significant impact on the mechanics of viral replication.",
