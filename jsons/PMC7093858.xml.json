When the altitude increases, barometric pressure and temperature decrease according to an exponential curve (Figure\n). At cruising altitude (10,000 to 13,000 m above sea level), temperature outside the aircraft is about \u221254\u00b0C and the atmospheric pressure is about 240 hPa. With decreasing barometric pressure, oxygen partial pressure also decreases (according to Dalton's law), and gases trapped within body cavities expand (according to the Boyle-Mariotte law). Thus, aviation regulation requires that all aircraft carrying passengers must be pressurized and maintain a cabin altitude of about 2438 m. Moreover, cabin air is first drawn from outside the aircraft and then heated, filtered, and recirculated, which results in very low humidity, about 10% to 20%.",

In addition, air travel is associated with an expansion of gases trapped and lowered air humidity.

With congestive heart failure, short-term (up to 1 hour) hypoxia at rest was associated with no significant adverse effects (including patients with New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms). Longer-term hypoxia (up to 7 hours) was tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate stable congestive heart failure. Following an episode of acute heart failure, the authors recommended waiting 6 weeks after stabilization prior to flying.34 Patients with stable congestive heart failure have no restrictions on flying, but for those with severe limitations (New York Heart Association class III/IV), airport assistance and oxygen supplementation should be considered.34\n",

However, atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias should be controlled prior to flying.
