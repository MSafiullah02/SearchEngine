            "text": "\nCryptosporidium parvum infection is one of the principal enteropathogens in neonatal goats (De Graaf et al., 1999) and has been reported in French dairy goats since 1983 (Polack et al., 1983). In both natural and experimental conditions, cryptosporidial infection is associated with diarrhoea and mortality in kids aged 1\u20132 weeks (Nagy et al., 1984, Thamsborg et al., 1990, Koudela and Jiri, 1997, Vieira et al., 1997). As demonstrated in natural conditions in calves, oocyst excretion mainly occurs beginning on day 3\u20136 post-infection, continuing for 6\u20139 days and usually persisting at a detectable but asymptomatic level until 1 month of age (Olson et al., 1997, Uga et al., 2000, Castro-Hermida et al., 2002). However, clinical cryptosporidiosis occasionally occurs in goats >4 week old (Johnson et al., 1999). Because no fully satisfactory chemoprophylaxis is available to control neonatal cryptosporidiosis (De Graaf et al., 1999), a better knowledge of the main risk factors of C. parvum infection in kids is needed to allow the implementation of preventive hygienic measures both reducing the environmental oocyst burden and preventing the transmission to neonates. Such epidemiological information is relatively scarce in dairy-goat farms compared to farms with other ruminants except for some data from Spain (Matos-Fernandez et al., 1994) and from Poland (Majewska et al., 2000). Our aim was to assess herd-level risk factors for two different levels of oocyst shedding from kids.",

One of the likely explanations is the hygienic degradation of the neonates\u2019 environment and the simultaneous increase in disease incidence during the whole kidding or calving period especially when parturition is highly seasonal. This is particularly the case in dairy-goat breeding where kidding period mainly extends from November to March with the neonates\u2019 premises not being cleaned during this period.

            "text": "In contrast, other results suggest an important role of the dam in the direct contamination of their offsprings. According to both the prepatent period of C. parvum infection and the breeding conditions of dairy calves in the Netherlands (immediate removal of calves from their dams, rearing in individual hutches), Huetink et al. (2001) considered that direct or indirect cow-to-calf transmission was probably the most important route of infection followed by indirect calf-to-calf transmission through vectors (caretakers, insects). Asymptomatic adult cattle or sheep can be inapparent carriers especially around parturition when an increase in oocyst output generally occurs (Xiao et al., 1994, Ortega-Mora et al., 1999, Ralston et al., 2003, Faubert and Litvinsky, 2000). Similarly, >25% of the goats >1 year old shed oocysts (Noordeen et al., 2001). Thus the risk factors we found (which mainly involved adult-goat management) have to be interpreted in relation with oocyst contamination, i.e output and persistency in adult premises. The vertical ventilation (ridge tile) appeared as a risk factor and this might be related to a more efficient system (compared to horizontal ventilation) leading to a paradoxically more favourable environment for the oocyst survival due to a lower level of ammonia in the litter (Jenkins et al., 1999, Walker et al., 1998). We also found that the type of the diet given to the adult goat was associated with an increased risk of C. parvum infection prevalence in kids. Forages might be involved through a direct (contaminated feed) or an indirect effect. Very little information is available on survival of oocysts in forage except the data of Merry et al. (1997) on ryegrass ensilage showing a 30% survival after 3 months. Except for contamination with rodent or pet faeces after collection, the survival of occysts on hay is expected to be very low if any because of the dryness of such a material. The impact of graminaceous versus leguminous in the diet on oocyst excretion remains to be investigated.",
