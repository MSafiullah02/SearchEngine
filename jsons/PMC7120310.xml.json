However, more than half of the patients treated for hematologic malignancies will develop a pulmonary complication during their follow-up, infectious pneumonia remaining the most common diagnosis that should be considered first in regard to its potential severity. Otherwise, new complications that may involve different organs, including the lungs, have been increasingly reported. Currently, over a quarter of lung infiltrates occurring in the context of hematological diseases are due to noninfectious causes [1]. Thus, lung physicians may be increasingly confronted with these lung disorders. Various noninfectious pulmonary complications have been described in the different hematological malignancies; however, these complications are most often studied in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this chapter, we will briefly review the lung diseases associated with various hematological malignancies before focusing on noninfectious pulmonary complications following allogeneic HSCT.",

In addition to the many pathogens potentially involved, a wide range of noninfectious causes should be considered. The pulmonary location of the hematological disorder should be considered depending on the underlying disease. Some hematological diseases, such as lymphoma, can progress in the lung, unlike others, such as myeloma, for which lung involvement is very rare. Pulmonary cardiogenic or noncardiogenic edema is frequent and can be due to hyperhydration required before chemotherapy, cardiotoxicity secondary to use of anthracyclines or increased capillary permeability from drugs such as all-trans-retinoid acid or cytosine arabinoside. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is common in patients with thrombocytopenia or allogeneic HSCT. Many drugs frequently used for the treatment of hematological disorders may cause lung damage (Pneumotox.com); these drugs include Bleomycin, Busulfan, Chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Cytosine, Fludarabine, Rituximab, Dasatinib and others (Table 32.1). Radiotherapy may cause radiation pneumonitis. Drug treatments can cause entirely different clinical patterns depending on the target organ in the respiratory system (lung, airways and pleura) [2].\n",

For example, sarcoid-like granulomatosis may be associated with lymphoma, eosinophilic pneumonia may occur in the course of a myelodysplastic syndrome and pulmonary graft-versus host disease (GVHD) may be a complication following allogeneic HSCT. The medical history of the patient, including the clinical history of lung involvement and the type of underlying malignancy, the lung CT scan and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), should be used when making a diagnosis. A lung biopsy, when possible, would rule out infection and would reinforce or even confirm a diagnostic hypothesis. However, it is rarely performed in this context because it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity and results in a definitive diagnosis in only 60 % of cases [3]. Furthermore, new biological tools including polymerase chain reaction for many pathogens and antigen for Aspergillus used on both respiratory samples and sera greatly help to diagnose an infection [4]. Finally, the overall diagnostic approach of lung infiltrates in patients treated for a hematological malignancy must take into account the possible overlapping of different infectious and/or noninfectious causes.\n",

Epidemiological studies have shown an association between the development of BO and the presence of active chronic GVHD, which led to the hypothesis that BO is, in fact, chronic GVHD of the lung [18]. The most important mechanism contributing to BO would then result from the immune-mediated attack of airway epithelial cells by donor T cells. As opposed to acute GVHD, chronic GVHD also involves B-cell stimulation, autoantibody synthesis and systemic fibrosis [19]. Mouse models of chronic GVHD involve three disease mechanisms: autoantibody synthesis, pro-fibrotic processes and defective thymic function. Thymic damage leads to a decrease in TReg cell number and function and defective negative selection of T cells [19].",

            "text": "The definitive diagnosis of BO is pathologic. The National Institutes of Health Consensus proposed some histopathological criteria for BO based on a limited amount of original data [23]. The Pathology Working Group Report retained the presence of unequivocal dense eosinophilic scarring of the bronchioles resulting in some degree of luminal narrowing as a diagnostic (Fig. 32.1b). Inflammation is common but variable and insufficient for diagnosis [23]. In fact, Yousem et al. and Yokoi et al. published small pathological series in allogeneic HSCT recipients with chronic GVHD and lung involvement [24, 25] and reported different small airway abnormalities in this setting. Yousem et al. described two types of bronchiolar affections: lymphocytic bronchiolitis and cicatricial BO. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is characterized by peribronchiolar/bronchiolar lymphocytic and plasmocellular infiltrate. Airway inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic and plasmocellular. Cicatricial BO is characterized by the obliteration of the airway lumen by dense fibrous tissue. The authors proposed that cicatricial BO is the late-stage of lymphocytic bronchiolitis [24]. The pathologic description of Yokoi et al. comes from eight autopsy cases. Small airway lesions varied from early inflammatory changes to late scarring in each case. The inflammatory lesions were usually mild and mostly lymphoplasmacytic, except in three patients with predominant neutrophilic infiltrates. In all cases, inflammatory and scarring stages were present simultaneously [25]. Although the gold standard for diagnosis of BO is the demonstration of bronchiolar lesions upon histological evaluation of a lung specimen, it is not current practice to obtain a lung biopsy. Transbronchial biopsies have poor sensitivity, and surgical lung biopsies are invasive and usually reserved for cases of confusing diagnosis. Thus, BO is usually diagnosed as a new fixed airflow obstruction demonstrated by pulmonary function testing (PFT). BO syndrome (BOS) is diagnosed based on clinical, functional and radiological evaluation of the patient.\n",

However, some patients do not meet this functional criterion; despite the presence of BOS, the FEV1/FVC ratio may remain normal (>70 %). In fact, because BOS is a disease of the small airway, distal airway obstruction may lead to air trapping, thereby increasing the residual volume (RV). Consequently, the FVC declines concomitantly with the FEV1, and the FEV1/FVC ratio stays over 70 % [27]. NIH-BOS criteria include signs of air trapping, observed either by PFT (RV >120 %) or high-resolution computed tomodensitometry (HRCT) (Table 32.3). Recently, modification of these guidelines has been proposed [18]. To minimize the dynamic collapse of airways during the forced expiratory maneuver, Chien et al. proposed the use of slow vital capacity (SVC) instead of FVC for the diagnosis of airway obstruction. They also suggested that patients with annual FEV1 declines >5 % (from pre-transplant PFT) be considered at high risk of developing BOS and that an annual FEV1 decline >10 % (from pre-transplant PFT) be considered a diagnostic criterion for early BOS, even for a FEV1 >75 % of the predicted value [18]. Finally, two groups of patients may be diagnosed with BOS: one with a classical obstructive ventilatory defect and one with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio [18, 27]. The prognoses of both patients are similar [27]. Future studies should focus on the early detection of BOS. Chien et al. found that allogeneic HSCT recipients with annual FEV1 declines >5 %, even with FEV1/FVC ratios >80 %, have higher risks of nonrelapse mortality; this suggests that early airflow decline can be used as an indicator of early BOS [28]. This finding should prompt systematic serial PFT after transplant, with careful attention to patients who develop airflow decline over time.\n",

Otherwise, HRCT is needed in the initial evaluation of symptomatic patients to eliminate other causes of respiratory symptoms, such as infectious or inflammatory pneumonitis. Its value in the follow-up of a patient diagnosed with BOS is limited unless new respiratory symptoms develop. Finally, a bronchoscopic exam should be performed to rule out infection in the presence of infiltrates at the HRCT. In the case of normal imaging studies, nasal aspirates, sputum stains and cultures are considered sufficient to rule out viral, bacterial or fungal disease [5].",

Despite advances in the management of allogeneic HSCT recipients, the survival and treatment of patients with BOS have not improved over the last two decades. The overall survival rates at 2 and 5 years after allogeneic HSCT are respectively 45 and 15 % in patients who develop BOS [26]. The natural history of BOS is variable. Classically, PFT declines with time, and patients develop infectious complications, which can lead to respiratory insufficiency and, eventually, death. Some patients remain stable after the development of airway obstruction, and a minority (20 %) will respond to treatment [31]. Actual management is based on case series and expert opinion. Based on the assumption that BOS is a manifestation of chronic GVHD, current practice involves optimizing or reintroducing immunosuppressive therapy upon a diagnosis of BOS. Some reports suggest that high-dose systemic corticosteroids (1\u20132 mg/kg) can improve or at least stabilize the FEV1. If BOS develops upon tapering the immunosuppressive therapy, clinicians usually reintroduce the tapered drug in combination with corticosteroids. Some case reports/series suggest other immunosuppressive therapies, such as TNF-receptor blockade, imatinib and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), may be efficacious [26]. These therapeutic options need to be studied further. Converging data suggest the ineffectiveness of rituximab for BOS treatment [32, 33].",

To minimize the morbidity associated with this treatment, considering the low efficacy of steroids in this setting, some authors have suggested alternative agents with anti-inflammatory properties. The use of topical steroid treatment is supported by two retrospective studies. We reported decreases in dyspnea and improvements in FEV1 in seven patients with new-onset airflow obstruction treated with combined inhaled therapy (budesonide-formeterol) [34]. Bashoura et al. reported stabilization or improvement in FEV1 in 16/17 BOS patients treated 3\u20136 months with high-dose fluticasone [35]. A recent study suggests bronchodilator responsiveness in BOS patients [36]. This information may support the inhaled combination therapy, including a long-acting bronchodilator and a corticosteroid, over an inhaled corticosteroid alone. The efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of BOS following allogeneic HSCT is controversial [37, 38]. Finally, the efficacy of montelukast as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in the treatment of chronic GVHD had been suggested in a pilot study [39]. These three agents are actually under study in BOS patients following HSCT, either alone or in combination [40].",

This definition was recently updated to include new microbiological diagnostic tools for the exclusion of infection, especially for newly described pathogens (Table 32.4) [45]. Thus, this syndrome regroups different clinical entities that can be classified according to the primitively attempted lung compartment: parenchyma (acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), OP, iatrogenic lung injury) or pulmonary blood vessels (engraftment syndrome, capillary leak syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage). IPS is thought to result from a variety of lung insults, including the toxic effects of HSCT conditioning regimens, immunologic cell-mediated injury, inflammatory cytokines, and occult pulmonary infections [45]. Peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS) occurring within 5 days of engraftment after allogeneic HSCT represents a clinical subset of IPS that should be identified because of its specific clinical characteristics and because its responsiveness to corticosteroids can lead to a good prognosis [45]. PERDS is the result of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with or without concurrent pleural effusions in the context of a diffuse capillary leak syndrome and dysfunction of other organs, such as the liver, kidney, skin or gut [45, 46].\n",

Although time from allogeneic HSCT is not a diagnostic criterion of this syndrome, IPS occurs early in the course of HSCT (median time: 3\u20137 weeks after HSCT), with a historical high mortality rate (60\u201380 %, depending on the study, and up to 90 % in case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation). Proposed risk factors of IPS include total body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning regimens, older recipient age, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia as an underlying disease and acute GVHD [45].

OP can occur in many different contexts: post-infection; following environmental, professional or toxic exposure; iatrogenically (due to medications, chemotherapy or radiotherapy); or associated with connective tissue diseases, other chronic inflammatory diseases, solid cancers, hematological malignancy, lung transplantation or allogeneic HSCT. When no specific cause is found, OP is referred to as cryptogenic (COP). For more clarity, the terminology \u201cBronchiolitis Obliterans with Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP)\u201d has been progressively abandoned because the major histological process is OP, whereas bronchiolar lesions are a minor and inconstant process [49]. The change in terminology is particularly relevant in the context of allogeneic HSCT to avoid confusion with BO, for which the clinical presentation and prognosis are very different.\n",

They identified a strong association between OP and previous signs of acute and chronic GVHD, suggesting a causal link between both entities [5, 7]. Other authors have also associated post-allogeneic HSCT OP with the presence of HLA B35 antigen [50]. The time from HSCT to OP onset ranged from a few days to more than 7 years, with a median time of 108 days. In 22 % of these cases, a tapering of immunosuppressive treatments preceded the respiratory signs. The clinical presentation was similar to that of COP, mimicking unresolved or subacute infectious pneumonia with unspecific symptoms (fever, dyspnea and cough) and physical signs (crackles). Radiological signs consisted of alveolar, nodular or interstitial opacities with a focal, multifocal or more diffuse extension that is indicative of the diagnosis when the topography of the lesions is peripheral or peribronchovascular [7, 51, 52] (Fig. 32.2a). Unlike COP, opacities were rarely migratory [7].",

            "text": "In addition to OP, other ILDs are generally poorly described and are usually referred to IPS if diagnosed early after allogeneic HSCT or interstitial pneumonitis without more precision in these studies. In most cases, ILDs are associated with a history of extrathoracic acute and/or chronic GVHD and usually occur following the tapering of immunosuppressive therapy, mostly within the first 2 years after allogeneic HSCT [53]. These findings raise the hypothesis of pulmonary patterns of chronic GVHD. Very few data regarding lung histological patterns of ILD post-allogeneic HSCT are available because lung biopsies are rarely performed in this setting. However, diffuse alveolar damage, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (Fig. 32.3) and eosinophilic pneumonia have been previously identified [24, 53\u201357]. Due to the difficulties of achieving lung biopsies in these patients and the current lack of impact of lung biopsy results on the management of patients in a noninfectious context, we reviewed 40 cases of ILD post-allogeneic HSCT and described their clinical characteristics and outcomes as it is usually done for idiopathic ILD [53]. The median time from allogeneic HSCT to ILD was 11.1 months (IQR, 9.1\u201319.2 months). The clinical presentation was unspecific, with cough (productive or not), variable levels of dyspnea and fever in half of the cases. As for IPS, infection had to be ruled out to retain the diagnosis of ILD. Radiological signs of ILD were variable in extent and ranged from localized to more or less diffuse (Fig. 32.3) [53]. BAL fluid analysis typically showed lymphocytic or both lymphocytic and neutrophilic alveolitis. In some cases, BAL can show an eosinophilic alveolitis that allows the diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia [55]. Pulmonary function tests usually showed a restrictive ventilatory defect associated with an alteration in the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. PFT could also reveal an obstructive lung disease, isolated or not, suggestive of an overlap or a continuum between ILD and BOS [53].\n",

A spectrum of pulmonary manifestations occurring in patients with a well-defined connective tissue disease (CTD) after allogeneic HSCT similar to idiopathic CTD has been reported [54]. Therefore, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid pneumonia have been reported in the course of Sj\u00f6gren-like disorders diagnosed on both clinical and biological characteristic features [54]. The incidence of these CTDs that may arise very late after allogeneic HSCT remains unknown, and they are most likely overlooked [54]. Several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed for these autoimmune manifestations, such as genetic predisposition, thymic deficiency, the expression of an abnormal B-cell and/or T-cell reconstitution or donor-related pathogenic clone transfer [58, 59]. The prognoses for these ILDs occurring in post-allogeneic HSCT connective tissue disorders are poor with very high mortality rates despite the usual administration of high dose steroids [54]. Considering therapeutic protocols similar to those used in CTD (e.g., cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or TNFR blockers) might be interesting in addition or as an alternative to the more classical steroid therapy.",
