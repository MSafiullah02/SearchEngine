These might include concerns re household job security and business viability (especially for private practitioners), through to cancelation of weddings and travel plans, and a loss of self-identity (eg, male colleagues are shaving their beards to ensure that mask fit is adequate for personal protection). These stressors may culminate in grief, anxiety and/or depression. More heart-wrenching aspects might include being unable to hug loved ones due to social distancing, or considering preferences for medical treatment in the event of critical illness for ourselves and those for whom we are responsible. We may experience anxiety about becoming infected and passing on the infection to others. We may also be anxious about the severity of the illness experienced. This may be particularly relevant if you or those close to you are at increased risk medically (eg, pregnancy, immunosuppression, older age)1 and/or socially (eg, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, refugees, or those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, all of whom are typically underserved by the healthcare system). Caring responsibilities for children or the elderly introduce additional considerations and stress. Many avenues that we might ordinarily use to manage these stressors may no longer be available due to social distancing, governmental closures of non-essential services, and infection control requirements.",

This may involve re-skilling and redeploying staff to expanded intensive care units, and discharging patients from our care earlier than usual to maintain intensive care and hospital bed access and flow. In outpatient and private practice, treatment may be able to be provided via telehealth technology. We are also required to work within new confines of infection control, where we might have to reconsider standard approaches to assessment and management of equipment. These changes will influence how we interact with patients and their families to manage their clinical conditions or involve them in clinical research. Local and global perspectives, and federal and state recommendations, also influence the rapidly changing situation. With so many modifications to decide upon and implement with urgency, it is important that we do not reinvent the wheel where resources already exist to help us.",

However, we will be doing this under a different set of conditions, in altered working environments, and/or with new teams. With the bandwidth of healthcare stretched to capacity, we must draw on existing resources and decades of research that is highly applicable to our practice.

Many hospitals will have issued directives about how to appropriately manage research activity including contingency planning, communication, management of participants, notification of protocol breaches, suspension of research, and communicating with ethical review committees. The Australian Clinical Trials Alliance has also provided valuable resources that address issues such as: suspending/restarting a trial, remote monitoring, replacing in-person visits with phone calls, and reducing the number of participant monitoring visits.19 A critical point for physiotherapy researchers to note is this: if a trial is amended to accommodate new restrictions and organisational directives, the registered trial protocol should be immediately updated on the registry to explain what is being changed and why. Otherwise, the opportunity to publish in high-impact journals may be limited, given the submitted trial must be completely consistent with the registered protocol. Also consider liaising early with funding bodies about any anticipated delays or change in research plans. Physiotherapy research higher degree students should keep up to date with university directives, and ensure regular communcation with their supervisors to develop and modify research plans.",

Many avenues that we might ordinarily use to manage stress (group exercise, social gatherings, viewing theatre performances, receiving a massage or spectating at sporting events) may no longer be available.
