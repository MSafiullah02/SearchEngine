Flavivirus NS1 is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in blood, is displayed on the surface of infected cells, and has been hypothesized to have immune evasion functions. Herein, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation by directly interacting with C4. Binding of NS1 to C4 reduced C4b deposition and C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. Although NS1 bound C4b, it lacked intrinsic cofactor activity to degrade C4b, and did not block C3 convertase formation or accelerate decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Instead, NS1 enhanced C4 cleavage by recruiting and activating the complement-specific protease C1s. By binding C1s and C4 in a complex, NS1 promotes efficient degradation of C4 to C4b. Through this mechanism, NS1 protects DENV from complement-dependent neutralization in solution. These studies define a novel immune evasion mechanism for restricting complement control of microbial infection.",

It consists of a network of soluble and cell surface proteins that recognize and target pathogens. Complement activation controls viral infections through multiple mechanisms, including enhanced B and T cell priming, release of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) that recruit leukocytes to the site of infection, production of opsonins (C1q, mannose binding lectin [MBL] , C4b, and C3b) that bind viral particles, and formation of C5b-9 membrane attack complexes that lyse virions and/or infected cells (for review see Avirutnan et al., 2008) . In response, viruses have evolved strategies to limit recognition by and activation of the complement cascade, including expression of surface proteins that bind the Fc domain of antibodies to prevent C1q-dependent complement activation, secretion of soluble viral proteins that mimic or recruit host complement regulators, direct incorporation of host complement control proteins on the virion, and up-regulation of complement regulatory proteins on the surface of infected cells (for review see Lambris et al., 2008) .",

DENV is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen that causes clinical syndromes in humans ranging from an acute self-limited febrile illness (dengue fever [DF] ) to a severe and life-threatening vascular leakage and bleeding diathesis (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [DHF/ DSS]). Globally, DENV causes an estimated 50 million infections annually, resulting in 500,000 hospitalizations and \ue07a22,000 deaths (Morens and Fauci, 2008) . Four serotypes of DENV circulate, and DHF/DSS is commonly associated with a secondary infection by a different serotype. Although antibody (Ab)-dependent enhancement of DENV infection in Fc\ue067 receptor-bearing cells has been proposed to initiate pathogenesis (Halstead, 1988) , the mechanism for how vascular leakage occurs remains uncertain. Cytopathic effects of virulent strains of DENV, a proinflammatory cytokine storm secondary to exuberant activation of poorly lytic cross-reactive T cells, and excessive complement activation have been suggested to contribute to the vascular leakage syndrome (for review see Clyde et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The 11-kb Flavivirus RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by viral and host proteases to generate three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Flavivirus NS1 is a 48-kD nonstructural glycoprotein that is absent from the virion. NS1 is an essential gene as it is a required cofactor for the NS5 polymerase during viral RNA replication (Mackenzie et al., 1996; Lindenbach and Rice, 1997; Khromykh et al., 1999) . In infected mammalian cells, NS1 is synthesized as a soluble monomer, dimerizes after posttranslational modification in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and is transported to the cell surface and accumulates extracellularly as higher order oligomers, including a hexamer (Flamand et al., 1999) . Soluble NS1 also binds back to the plasma membrane of cells through interactions with specific sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Avirutnan et al., 2007) . DENV NS1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS, although the mechanism remains uncertain. High levels of NS1 are detected in the serum of DENV-infected patients and correlate with severe disease (Libraty et al., 2002; Avirutnan et al., 2006) . NS1 has been proposed to facilitate immune complex formation (Avirutnan et al., 2006) ; elicit autoantibodies that react with platelet and extracellular matrix proteins (Falconar, 1997) or damage endothelial cells via Ab-dependent, complement-mediated cytolysis (Lin et al., 2003) ; and directly enhance infection (Alcon-LePoder et al., 2005) . Recently, WNV NS1 was shown to attenuate the alternative pathway of complement activation by binding the complement regulatory protein factor H (Chung et al., 2006a) .",

Serum-free supernatants from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells that stably propagate a Microtiter plates were coated with BSA, C4, or C4b (5 \u00b5g/ml). After incubation with serum-free supernatants from BHK-DENV2-Rep cells or control BHK cells, bound DENV NS1 was detected using DENV NS1-specific mAbs. Data are the mean \u00b1 SD for three independent experiments. Asterisks denote NS1 binding that is statistically different from binding to background (**, P < 0.005; ***, P < 0.0005). (B-E) Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. Serum-free supernatants from BHK-DENV2-Rep or control BHK cells were incubated with purified C4 (B and D) or C4b (C and E; 20 \u00b5g/ml) and Western blots were performed after immunoprecipitation with anti-DENV NS1 mAb (2G6)-Sepharose (B and C) or anti-human C4-Sepharose (D and E). Immunoprecipitated material was probed with a goat polyclonal anti-human C4 Ab or DENV NS1-specific mAb (1F11), respectively.

Notably, in the starting material of this C4 preparation, 20-30% was C4b. Western blot results are representative of two or three independent experiments. DENV-2 subgenomic replicon (BHK-DENV2-Rep cells) and secrete high levels (up to 4 \u00b5g/ml) of NS1 (Avirutnan et al., 2007) and from control BHK cells were added to complement protein-coated wells.

Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the NS1 and C4/C4b interaction (Fig. 1, B-E) .

The specificity of DENV NS1 for inhibiting hemolytic activity was confirmed in preclearance experiments ( Fig. S1 A) as follows: preincubation of DENV NS1 with anti-NS1 (2G6)-but not anti-E (4G2)-Sepharose abolished the inhibitory effect ( Fig. S1 B) . Notably, the amount and inhibitory activity of DENV NS1 after the preclearing step with 4G2-Sepharose was similar to that observed with a 1:2 dilution of starting material. The concentrations of NS1 used in these studies have been observed in plasma and pleural fluid of human patients infected with severe DENV infection (Alcon et al., 2002; Libraty et al., 2002; Avirutnan et al., 2006) .

Initially, a two-step purification was performed to generate highly purified preparations of NS1 (Avirutnan et al., 2007) . The elution profile of affinity-purified WNV NS1 (first column) followed by ion-exchange (second) column displays a heterogeneous profile (Fig. 6 A) , which is likely caused by the presence of oligomers of soluble NS1 (Flamand et al., 1999; Fig. S5 ). The heterogeneity in size was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography ( Fig. 6 F and Fig. S6 ). After purification, each fraction of NS1 was tested for C4 inhibitory activity in the hemolysis assay, as well as the presence of hamster C1s by Western blot with a cross-reactive anti-human C1s polyclonal Ab. After separation by ionexchange chromatography, all fractions of WNV NS1 had C4 inhibitory activity, with the exception of the main peak fractions (B8-B10; Fig. 6 B) . In our functional experiments (Figs. 2-5), high concentrations of NS1 (20-50 \u00b5g/ml) were required to inhibit hemolysis. However, when the fraction with peak activity (fraction C1; Fig. 6 , A and B) was serially diluted and subjected to the C4 hemolysis assay, the specific C4 inhibitory activity was observed at a much lower concentration of NS1 (1.75 \u00b5g/ml; Fig. 6 C) . Hamster C1s was detected in most of the fractions of purified WNV NS1 that had C4 inhibitory activity, but not in the NS1 fractions that lacked activity (Fig. 6 D) . Correspondingly, the fractions of WNV NS1 after size exclusion chromatography that exhibited inhibitory activity in the C4 hemolysis assay (Fig. 6 , F and G) also had detectable levels of C1s (Fig. 6 H) . Although similar results were observed with DENV NS1, hamster C1s C4-\ue061 compared with C4b-\ue061\ue039 chain. Instead, preincubation of DENV NS1 with C4, before addition of C1s, increased the generation of the C4b-\ue061\ue039 chain (Fig. 5 A) . This result was initially surprising to us because, if NS1 promoted C4b-\ue061\ue039 chain accumulation on the erythrocyte cell surface, it should have enhanced hemolysis. However, a loss of C4-\ue061 chain and accumulation of C4b \ue061\ue039 chain was also observed in the Subsequently, the NS1-C4, BSA-C4, and lysozyme-C4 solutions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 15 min.

In contrast, only a single band of proC1s was observed in a concentrated (100-fold) serum-free culture supernatant from uninfected BHK cells (Fig. 6 E) . Autocatalytic activation of proC1s independent of its activator C1r has been previously shown (Morgan and Nair, 1975) .

Higher concentrations of C4 were used in this assay compared with the previous hemolysis experiments to overcome the inherent C4 cleavage activity of hamster C1s/ proC1s that copurified with WNV and DENV NS1. Notably, WNV and DENV NS1, but not BSA or lysozyme, enhanced the activity of C1s and proC1s to cleave C4 as observed by decreased hemolysis (Fig. 8, A and B) . Most importantly, although purified YFV NS1 did not associate significantly with hamster C1s/proC1s to promote degradation of C4 by itself (Fig. 4 B) , it readily bound human C1s/proC1s (Fig. 7, G and H) , which then facilitated cleavage of C4 (Fig. 8,  A and B) in a manner similar to WNV and DENV NS1. Acceleration of C4 degradation in solution by human proC1s in the presence of YFV NS1 was confirmed in kinetic experiments (Fig. 8 C) . This activity was specific to NS1, as lysozyme or BSA did not alter the kinetics of C4 cleavage by proC1s (Fig. 8 C and not depicted) .",

Because Flavivirus NS1 antagonizes C4 and subsequent C3 deposition, we hypothesized that soluble NS1 that accumulates to high amounts (up to 50 \u00b5g/ml) in serum (Alcon et al., 2002) could protect DENV from direct complement-mediated neutralization. As expected, DENV was efficiently neutralized by naive wild type GPS (Fig. 9 A) . In contrast, C4-deficient GPS or heatinactivated wild-type serum failed to diminish DENV infectivity, confirming a complement-dependent neutralization mechanism (Fig. 9, A and B) . Addition of purified human C4 to guinea pig C4-deficient serum restored the ability to neutralize DENV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9 B) . Importantly, the addition of soluble DENV NS1 (Fig. 9 B) or WNV NS1 (not depicted), but not BSA, rescued infectivity. This antagonistic effect of NS1 was C4-dependent, as addition of higher concentrations of human C4 overcame the inhibition of GPS neutralization by NS1. Although one study suggested that pretreatment of cells with soluble DENV NS1 before infection of hepatoma cells improves virus yield twofold (Alcon-LePoder et al., 2005) , we did not observe this phenomenon; when NS1 was added alone or mixed with heat-inactivated serum, no changes in infectivity were observed ( Fig. 9 B and not depicted) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that soluble NS1 can antagonize C4 function, which affects viral infection.",

Asterisks denote hemolysis conditions that are statistically different from the cells treated with C1s or proC1s alone (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.005; ***, P < 0.0005). (Hortin et al., 1989) . As DENV NS1 binds sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Avirutnan et al., 2007) , it is tempting to speculate that NS1 binding near the sulfated tyrosine on C4 could render it more susceptible to C1s or C1s-like proteases. Investigations with mutant NS1 proteins and C4 lacking sulfation are planned to directly test this hypothesis.",

Several biochemical experiments, however, suggest that the interaction of Flavivirus NS1 with C1s and C4 is specific: (a) YFV NS1, which does not copurify efficiently with hamster C1s, binds C4 but lacks cleavage activity. However, addition of YFV NS1 to limiting quantities of human proC1s and C1s enhances the cleavage rate of C4; (b) WNV, YFV, and DENV NS1 all bind directly to human proC1s and C1s by ELISA; (c) WNV NS1 specifically shifts the size exclusion chromatography profile of human proC1s. Although our data suggest that NS1 promotes cleavage of C4 by recruiting and enhancing the enzymatic activity of C1s, it remains unclear mechanistically how NS1 achieves this. Binding of NS1 to C1s/proC1s may cause structural changes that increase the proteolytic activity of C1s. Alternatively, oligomeric forms of NS1 could bring C4 and C1s together for a sustained interaction that promotes cleavage.",

This discrepancy may be explained by the presence of natural and neutralizing IgM against NS1 and the relative concentrations of NS1 and C4 in serum (comparatively low NS1 and high C4) that could attenuate an inhibitory effect on C4 activation. In peripheral tissues where the majority of Flavivirus infection occurs, higher local levels of NS1 coupled with lower levels of extravascular complement and Ab concentrations could efficiently inhibit C4 function. Flaviviruses, thus, may use NS1 to bind C1s proenzyme produced from the same infected cell or neighboring cells to inactivate C4 in solution. By forming a complex with C1s, NS1 can promote continuous cleavage of C4 to C4b. In solution, this nascently generated C4b would have only a few microseconds to bind to a target before further hydrolysis, as observed with activated C4b. Thus, NS1 targeting of C4 could directly limit opsonization and neutralization of virions and thereby facilitate local dissemination.",

Herpesviruses and coronaviruses interfere with CP activation by secreting or expressing decoy molecules with Fc receptor function (Oleszak et al., 1993; Para et al., 1982) , whereas Porphyromonas, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus bacteria degrade IgG and/or inhibit IgG interaction with C1q (Bj\u00f6rck and Kronvall, 1984; Schenkein et al., 1995; von Pawel-Rammingen and Bj\u00f6rck, 2003) . Additionally, the Staphylococcus SCIN and Efb proteins block CP and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases (Rooijakkers et al., 2005; Jongerius et al., 2007) . Mechanistically, NS1 promotes cleavage of C4 in solution, which attenuates generation of C3b and C5b-9 on targets (e.g., virions or virus-infected cells). An analogous cleavage of C3 to C3blike proteins by extracellular gelatinase has been described as a mechanism of complement evasion by Enterococcus faecalis (Park et al., 2008) . Our studies do not rule out the possibility that NS1 also inhibits complement activation by independently preventing C4b attachment to target cells. Unlike poxviruses, which express viral virulence factors with structural and functional similarities to human complement regulators (Rosengard et al., 2002) , NS1 itself lacks any apparent sequence homology to known complement proteins or enzymes. Interestingly, C4 is the only complement protein that is sulfated on a tyrosine residue, and this posttranslational modification increases the efficiency of C4 cleavage by C1s (A) Neutralization of DENV by GPS. DENV virions were incubated with untreated or heat-inactivated (HI) normal GPS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to allow complement activation.

Purified human C4 at the indicated concentrations was incubated with soluble DENV NS1 or BSA (50 \u00b5g/ml) or buffer (PBS) alone for 1 h at room temperature. DENV was then added and followed by untreated or HI C4-deficient C4D GPS. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before infection of BHK-21 cells, as described in A.
