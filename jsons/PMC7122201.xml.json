            "text": "PALF has used INR as a surrogate marker to denote overall liver synthetic inadequacy and an impending multiorgan failure. Coagulopathy is not only a key criterion in diagnosing paediatric ALF but also helps as prognostic marker. Due to short half of several liver-based clotting factors, PT/INR functions as a dynamic marker of synthetic inadequacy due to loss of functioning hepatocytes in ALF. Factors II, VII, IX and X depend on vitamin K for carboxylation of terminal glutamic acid residues to convert them into active form (Fig. 8.1). Correction of coagulopathy by intravenous vitamin K differentiates between vitamin K deficiency due to decreased absorption and synthetic liver failure. Isolated prolonged APTR is not due to liver disease, as factor VII in extrinsic pathway (Fig. 8.1) has the shortest half-life of the vitamin K-dependent factors; therefore, it is the first factor depleted in ALF and invariably affects INR. Due to defective synthesis and impaired clearance of procoagulant/anticoagulant factors, inflammatory mediators, infection, etc., there could be a degree of intravascular coagulation (IC) that invariably exists in ALF which can progress to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation. Haemostasis in liver disease is best assessed using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is a point-of-care assay using a specialized machine that assesses clot formation in whole blood, including plasmatic and cellular components. TEG provides a graphical representation (Fig. 8.2) of assembly of a clot in whole blood and provides an assessment of overall haemostasis.\n\n",

Usually the disease runs a benign course with spontaneous recovery, but some might require liver transplantation [13]. With hepatitis E infection, the risk of developing ALF in adults is 0.6\u20132.8% [14]. Recent evidence suggests that case fatality due to hepatitis E-induced ALF in pregnancy is similar to that of age-matched general population [15]. The ALF due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) can occur at the time of acute infection, reactivation of chronic HBV infection or seroconversion from a hepatitis B e antigen-positive to a hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb)-positive state. Superinfection or co-infection of HBV-infected patients with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can cause liver failure.",

This hypothesis is supported by successful prevention of severe disease by antenatal and postnatal treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. High serum ferritin is a non-specific marker and elevated in other causes of ALF and so should not be used a marker for diagnosis.

Galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia type I and fructosaemia are few of the metabolic disorders that could present as ALF. Tyrosinaemia type I is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism, due to absence of enzyme fumarylacetoacetase, the last enzyme in a series of five enzymes needed to break down tyrosine. This results in formation of intermediate compounds, maleylacetoacetic acid and fumarylacetoacetic acid, which is converted to succinylacetone, a toxin that damages the liver and kidneys. Oral NTBC (nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione) and phenylalanine- and tyrosine-free diet could help liver recovery, but some children might require LT. Galactosaemia type 1 is autosomal recessive disorder with mutation in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene located on chromosome 9p13. Lactose-free diet should be started in any infant presenting with ALF or hepatitis until the quantitative GALT activity is available. Galactose-free diet and supportive treatment may allow recovery of ALF. Rarely inborn errors of bile acid synthesis can present as ALF.",
