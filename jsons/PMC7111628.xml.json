HSV infection causes skin lesions that are generally localized at the oral, nasal, and ocular level with HSV-1 infection, whereas with HSV-2, infections most commonly occur at genital-skin and mucosa sites (Liu and Cohen, 2015; Smith and Robinson, 2002). Approximately 60%\u201390% of the adult human population worldwide is sera-positive for HSV-1 (Carr et al., 2001). The current FDA approved antiviral agents for herpesviruses involve mainly nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir (ACV) and pencyclovir, which mainly inhibit viral genome replication. Despite these successes, drug resistance, and side effects remain unresolved issues in the fight against HSV infections (Morfin and Thouvenot, 2003). Hence, the development of novel anti-HSV agents with active mechanisms different from nucleoside analogues is of high importance.",

Like other flavonoids, myricetin is reported to possess many different biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-thrombotic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects (Cushnie and Lamb, 2005; Dajas et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2014; Ong and Khoo, 1997; Santhakumar et al., 2014; Semwal et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2010). Pasetto et al. reported that myricetin possessed anti-HIV-1 activities with low toxicity, and it mainly inhibited the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase (Pasetto et al., 2014). Lyu et al. found that some flavonoids such as myricetin and quercetinin showed moderate inhibitory effects against HSV-1 in Vero cells (Lyu et al., 2005). Yu and co-workers found that myricetin and scutellarein potently inhibited the SARS-CoV helicase protein in vitro by affecting the ATPase activity, suggesting that myricetin and scultellarein might serve as SARS-CoV chemical inhibitors (Yu et al., 2012). Thus, myricetin has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-viral agent.",

The results showed that myricetin possessed anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activities with very low toxicity. Myricetin may block HSV infection through direct interaction with virus gD protein to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion. Moreover, intraperitoneal therapy of myricetin markedly improved mice survival and reduced virus titers in both lungs and spinal cord. Thus, myricetin merits further investigation as a novel anti-HSV agent in the future.",

To assess real-time binding of myricetin to the gD proteins on CM5 chips, myricetin with different concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125 \u03bcM) dissolved in DMSO, was injected over the sensor chip surface with gD immobilized within 2 min, followed by a 10-min wash with 1 \u00d7 PBST buffer. The sensor chip surface was then regenerated by washing with NaOH (2 mM) for 30 s. All binding experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C with a constant flow rate of 2 \u03bcl/s PBS buffer. To correct for non-specific binding and bulk refractive index change, a blank channel without gD was used and run simultaneously for each experiment. Then, the BiacoreT200 SPR evaluation software was used to calculate the kinetic parameters, and the changes in mass due to the binding response were recorded as resonance units (RU).",

Subsequently, the antiviral activity was determined by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 2\nA, pretreatment of HSV-1 or HSV-2 with 20 \u03bcM myricetin for 1 h before infection significantly reduced the virus titers of HSV, compared to the non-treated virus control group (p < 0.01), suggesting that myricetin may have direct interaction with HSV particles. Treatment of myricetin during adsorption or after adsorption also possessed obvious inhibition on virus multiplication (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). However, pretreatment of cells did not significantly reduce virus titers in vitro (Fig. 2A), suggesting that myricetin may not interact with Vero cells directly. Moreover, the indirect immunofluorescence assay under these four conditions (Pachota et al., 2017) indicated that pretreatment of virus with myricetin (10 \u03bcM) before infection also significantly reduced the expression of ICP27 in HSV-1 infected cells (Fig. 2B), which was in concern with the results in plaque assay (Fig. 2A).

Briefly, for HSV binding assay, HSV-1 (MOI = 1.0) was adsorbed to HeLa cells for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C in the absence or presence of 20 \u03bcM myricetin before washing with PBS. For entry assay, HSV-1 (MOI = 1.0) was firstly adsorbed to HeLa cells at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h before washing with PBS. Then myricetin (20 \u03bcM) was added to cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After that, cells were treated with proteinase K to remove adsorbed but not internalized virus. Then the immunofluorescence assay was performed to determine the amount of HSV virions binding to or entering into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2C and E, myricetin treatment (20 \u03bcM) during adsorption significantly decreased the fluorescence of ICP5 protein on cell surface, compared to that in non-treated virus control cells, suggesting that myricetin may block virus adsorption process of HSV. Moreover, at 1 h p.i., many fluorescence spot of ICP5 could be found at the nucleus area (white arrow indicated), suggesting that HSV-1 nucleocapsid had been egressed from late endosomes and delivered to the nuclear periphery in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). However, myricetin treatment during entry process dramatically reduced the fluorescence of ICP5 in cytoplasm, and only very little fluorescence could be observed in cell nucleus, suggesting that myricetin may also be able to block HSV entry process in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D, 2F and 2G). Thus, myricetin may possibly block HSV infection mainly through interfering with HSV binding and entry process.",

However, treatment with myricetin (30, 15 \u03bcM) during 5\u20137 h p.i. markedly blocked syncytium formation only with a limited number of small syncytia, suggesting that myricetin may inhibit HSV-induced cell fusion.

We employed a drug affinity responsive target stability assay (DARTS) (Lomenick et al., 2009), which relies on the reduction of protease susceptibility of the target protein upon drug binding, to detect the potential interaction between myricetin and gD protein. In brief, HSV-1 infected Vero cell lysates were digested with pronase in the presence or absence of myricetin (60 \u03bcM), then the amount of gD protein in cell lysates was detected by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, HSV-1 gD protein was obviously protected by protease digestion in the extracts of myricetin (60 \u03bcM) treated cells especially under pronase treatment at 3 \u03bcg/ml, suggesting that myricetin may interact with HSV gD protein in HSV-1 infected Vero cells. However, myricetin (60 \u03bcM) could not protect other virus surface glycoproteins such as gB, gC, and gH/gL proteins from protease digestion in HSV-1 infected cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, the cellular surface receptors of HSV-1 such as HVEM and nectin-1 could also not be protected from protease digestion by myricetin (60 \u03bcM) (Fig. 3D). Thus, myricetin may interfere with HSV binding and entry process through targeting virus gD protein rather than cellular receptors of HSV.",

The results showed that the lung tissues in virus-control group showed marked infiltration of inflammatory cells and the presence of massive hyperaemia in the lumen (Fig. 6E). However, mice treated with myricetin (2.5 or 5 mg\u00b7kg-1) following infection had intact columnar epithelium even in the presence of tiny serocellular exudates in the lumen (Fig. 6E). In addition, treatment of myricetin (5 mg\u00b7kg-1) nearly had no hyperaemia and infiltration of inflammatory cells in brain tissues (Fig. 6F). Myricetin (2.5 mg\u00b7kg-1) treated mice only had tiny hyperaemia in the brain tissues, comparable to the effects of acyclovir (10 mg\u00b7kg-1) (Fig. 6F). Thus, myricetin may be able to attenuate pneumonia and encephalitis symptoms in HSV infected mice.",

In this study, we discovered that myricetin possessed anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activities in different cells with very low toxicity (SI > 150). Myricetin may block HSV infection through direct interaction with virus gD protein to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion, which was different from the nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir.

In addition, myricetin can block HSV induced membrane fusion and interfere with virus binding and entry process, suggesting that myricetin may interact with some surface glycoproteins of HSV. The results of DARTS assay and gD binding assay indicated that myricetin may interact with virus gD protein rather than cellular receptors of HSV to block virus binding and entry (Fig. 3). The data from SPR assay verified that myricetin can truly bind to HSV-1 gD protein with high affinity (KD \u2248 60.88 nM) (Fig. 3E). The molecular docking analysis indicated that myricetin may interact with Gln41, Leu44, Glu45 and Asn94 of gD protein through hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 3G and H). Furthermore, myricetin treatment inhibited the activation of EGFR, PI3K and Akt proteins in HSV infected or gD treated non-infected cells, and reduced the mRNA levels of virus proteins in HSV-infected cells (Fig. 5). Considered that EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway is required for efficient HSV replication (Tiwari and Shukla, 2010), we suppose that myricetin may interact with virus gD protein to interfere with the activation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway so as to further inhibit subsequent replication of HSV.",

Moreover, the histopathological analysis indicated that myricetin treatment also significantly attenuated the pneumonia and encephalitis symptoms in HSV-infected mice, comparable to the effects of acyclovir. In contrast to acyclovir, myricetin can block HSV binding and entry process with low toxicity, suggesting that it may be used for therapy and prophylaxis of HSV infection.
