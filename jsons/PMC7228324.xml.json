All nursing home patients admitted to our institution with acute respiratory infections are isolated in negative pressure rooms and tested once for COVID\u201019 if the clinical suspicion is low. If there is significant concern, some patients may even be subject to a repeat swab before transfer to a general ward. Contingency plans have been made to cohort patients with respiratory symptoms and pneumonia in designated wards if cases exceed the capacity of our isolation facilities. At present we have not yet had to resort to this alternative. In addition, on discharge, nursing homes have begun to request letters from hospitals to certify that returning residents do not have COVID\u201019. Such heightened vigilance has prevented the spread of a single COVID\u201019 case to nursing homes in Singapore.",

Restraint use has also gone up, whereas our geriatric medicine ward practices a no\u2010restraint policy. Nursing home patients in particular have higher rates of dementia, delirium, and behavioral issues8 that require greater nursing care, which is challenging in isolation facilities, especially in the context of a global pandemic. These are inevitable given that protection of healthcare workers is a priority, and it is difficult for healthcare staff to attend promptly to patients in isolation facilities with behavioral issues and cognitive impairment because they would need to don full personal protective equipment before any patient contact. In addition, we have started to use technology such as the Beam robot9 to minimize patient contact, with plans to roll these out to other institutions. However, the use of technology has limitations, especially when dealing with older patients.",
