Despite the development of highly effective antiretroviral agents (ARVs), therapy does not eradicate HIV infections and life-long treatment is necessary (Berg, 1986). In the course of long-term treatment, emergence of drug-resistant HIV which reduces the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy can threaten virologic suppression of HIV. Developing novel therapeutics with a high genetic barrier to HIV resistance and low toxicity thus remains a necessity. The development of a specific virucidal compound with the ability to interfere with multiple stages of HIV replication has the potential to add significantly to the ability to treat HIV infection.",

            "text": "The nucleocapsid protein 7 (NCp7) of HIV is an unexploited target to disrupt HIV with small molecules (Mori et al., 2015). Established HIV targets for therapeutic applications are enzymes (namely HIV protease, integrase, or reverse transcriptase) or viral entry/fusion inhibitors. HIV-1 NCp7 is a small, 55 amino acid protein that contains two highly conserved zinc fingers derived from a Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys (CCHC) motif. The main role of NCp7 is to bind to viral RNA and protect it from degradation (Covey, 1986, Guo et al., 2002, Ramboarina et al., 1999, Tanchou et al., 1998). The alteration of any one of the zinc-chelating amino acids or surrounding amino acids results in the production of non-infectious virus. NCp7 functions at multiple stages of HIV replication, including: reverse transcription, integration, Tat-promoted transcription, auto-catalysis of Gag-Pol precursors to form functional protease, promotion of Gag assembly and interaction with viral genomic RNA, and protection of double-stranded HIV genomic RNA from degradation (Buckman et al., 2003, Guo et al., 2000, Hargittai et al., 2004, Turpin et al., 1996, Zybarth and Carter, 1995, Berkowitz et al., 1993, Dawson and Yu, 1998, Shubsda et al., 2002, Lapadat-Tapolsky et al., 1993). The mechanistic activities of NCp7 suggest a potentially high genetic barrier to the selection of resistance and suggest that any resistant strains that may emerge might suffer significant loss of fitness. In vitro evaluations have confirmed that removal of zinc from the zinc fingers results in a loss of viral infectivity, impaired reverse transcription, and defective Gag-precursor maturation.",

Some NCp7 inhibitors act by covalent modification of the target, although these molecules typically lead to undesirable toxicity. The recent report using diselenobisbenzamides to inhibit HIV replication via covalent modification of NCp7 is a promising new development in this area (Sancineto et al., 2015). Another strategy to inhibit NCp7 is to screen for non-covalent inhibitors. There is recent success in this area that has identified compounds based on a rhodanine core structure (Kim et al., 2015). The entire collection of NCp7 inhibitors, however, all have EC50 values for antiviral activity against HIV in the low micromolar range. Compared to most drugs used to treat HIV infection, the antiviral activity of NCp7 inhibitors is significantly weaker. Therefore, alternative strategies to target NCp7 should be considered.",

SAMTs also inhibit HIV replication in both acutely and chronically HIV-infected cells. SAMTs specifically transfer an acetyl group to a cysteine of NCp7, which is then transferred intramolecularly to a neighboring lysine side chain. After NCp7 is acetylated by the SAMT, the protein loses zinc coordination, unfolds, and can no longer function to support HIV replication. We also discovered that after acetyl transfer to NCp7, the conjugate thiol of the SAMT can be reacetylated via a pathway involving acetyl CoA. This mechanism potentially allows SAMTs to inactivate multiple copies of NCp7 via a catalytic mechanism shown in Fig. 1.",

Additional studies on the mechanism of SAMTs determined that the acetyl group did not need to be part of the molecule at the time of delivery to an infected cell. Instead, treatment with the conjugate thiol of the SAMT (see conjugate thiol of 247, Fig. 1) was sufficient to achieve antiviral activity due to the intracellular activation of the conjugate thiol with acetyl CoA (Miller Jenkins et al., 2010). While the thiol is relatively stable in solid form, in solution it can slowly oxidize to form a disulfide. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether a thiol and its corresponding prodrug (which would avoid oxidation in solution) may provide an easier drug formulation solution to designing SAMT-based therapy to treat HIV infection.",

Combination antiviral effects (efficacy and toxicity) are analyzed statistically by the Prichard and Shipman MacSynergy II methodology. The MacSynery II analysis includes calculation of the dose response of the two compounds when used alone followed by calculation of the expected additive level of antiviral inhibition when the compounds are used together based on the individual dose response curves. The expected level of activity at each of the concentration data points was then compared to the experimentally determined antiviral activity in the assay. The expected activity was subtracted from the realized activity, yielding a negative, zero or positive value. These values were plotted, yielding a three-dimensional representation of the data. Zero values indicating that the expected and realized activity were the same yields a flat surface which is indicative of an additive interaction of the two compounds. Positive values indicate that the realized activity was greater than the expected activity and thus a potentially synergistic interaction of the compounds was observed in the assay. The accumulation of positive points on the synergy plot yields a three-dimensional surface projecting above the plane of additivity and the volume of the surface above the plane can be calculated and expressed (in units of \u03bcM2% for MacSynergy II). In contrast, negative values indicate that the realized activity was less than the expected activity, yielding a surface projecting below the plane of additivity indicative of an antagonistic interaction of the compounds. Our extensive experience with the evaluation of combination assay data has resulted in the following interpretations of the synergy volumes derived from MacSynergy II data: >100 \u03bcM2% is defined as a highly synergistic interaction; 51\u201399 \u03bcM2% is defined as synergistic; 0\u201350 \u03bcM2% and \u221250 to 0 \u03bcM2% is defined as additive; -99 to \u221251 \u03bcM2% is defined as antagonistic; and <-100 \u03bcM2% is defined as highly antagonistic.",

For MDH-1-38, an amide coupling between the hydrochloride salt of \u03b2-alanine amide and thiosalicylic acid is facilitated using the reagent HCTU. Once this reaction is complete, a standard work up yields the disfulfide 1 in 73% yield. This disulfide is reduced using TCEP to yield MDH-1-38. The synthesis of the prodrug NS1040 is performed in two-steps, in a single flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. After performing the same amide bond reaction between thiosalicylic acid and \u03b2-alanine amide, chloromethyl butyrate is added. After work up of the reaction, NS1040 is isolated in 52% yield (Scheme 1). To ensure that NS1040 could be easily converted to MDH-1-38, routine metabolite identification studies were performed in vitro using human plasma (Supporting Information). After incubation for 1 and 48 h in human plasma, MDH1-38 was clearly identified along with a minor metabolite (M3). Additional evidence for conversion of NS1040 to MDH-1-38 was obtained by studying in vivo pharmacokinetics in rats (see section 3.10).",

Cell to cell transmission of HIVIIIB for three consecutive passages was significantly reduced by treatment of infected CEM-SS cells with 2 \u03bcM of MDH-1-38 as measured by quantification of extracellular virus (by RT assay and p24 ELISA) and virus infectivity (TCID50/mL) (Table 6\n). The prodrug NS1040 was approximately 3-fold less effective than MDH-1-38 at reducing cell to cell HIV transmission, which we believe falls within the range of error for this particular assay. In fresh human PBMCs, HIV transmission using clade C strain 92US727 was similarly reduced by 3.25 \u03bcM of MDH-1-38 and 5 \u03bcM of NS1040 following 2 and 3 passages as measured by virus quantification using RT assay and p24 ELISA, as well as virus infectivity measured by TCID50/mL (Table 7\n). Saquinavir was evaluated in parallel as a positive control compound in the both the CEM-SS and PBMC assays. Significant reduction in virus replication and subsequent infectivity of CEM-SS cells or PBMCs from virus treated with Saquinavir was demonstrated.",

In tests for inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, neither NS1040 nor MDH-1-38 had significant inhibitory activity. A standard hERG test for cardiotoxicity was also negative. To determine the toxicity in vivo, the toxicity of NS1040 in Sprague-Dawley rats was examined to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from a single oral administration and examine repeat dose toxicity from once daily oral administration for 14 consecutive days. NS1040 was administered by oral gavage as a suspension in 2% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) in water. The suspensions of NS1040 were all vortexed and sonicated to obtain homogeneous solutions prior to administration. For the MTD studies, doses of 750, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg were delivered at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Doses of 2000 mg/kg were delivered at a dose volume of 20 mL/kg to account for increases in viscosity. Higher doses were not possible due to ethical limits on the quantity of test article that can be reasonably administered for evaluation of toxicity. After each dose, there was a four-day observation period to examine cageside and clinical observations, body weights, and food consumption. Remarkably, NS1040 did not exhibit any toxicity at any dose in the MTD study. In the repeat dose toxicity study, NS1040 was administered in the same formulation at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Animals were separated into a main group that was sacrificed at day 15 of the study, and a recovery group that was sacrificed on day 29. During the study, cageside and clinical observations, body weights, and food consumption were all monitored. Clinical pathology was also examined after animals were sacrificed. Across all parameters, there was no toxicity observed with NS1040. At the higher doses, cloudy urine samples were noted for some of the rats. However, this observation did not correlate with any abnormal kidney-related clinical chemistry or other histopathological changes in the urinary system. Other minor observations are documented, but none are considered to be significant toxicological findings directly related to NS1040.",

The compounds were similarly and broadly active against a geographically diverse panel of clinical HIV-1 subtypes and inhibited CXCR4-tropic, CCR5-tropic and dual-tropic virus strains with equal efficacy. MDH-1-38 and its prodrug were equally active against monocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 in fresh human monocytes. These data demonstrate that MDH-1-38 and its prodrug NS1040 would be expected to be active against HIV-1 strains found throughout the world as a therapeutic product. The lack of cross resistance to HIV strains conferring resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, as well as multidrug resistant isolates, indicates a distinct mechanism of antiviral action for MDH-1-38 and its prodrug when compared with approved HIV drugs. Following cell-based and biochemical inhibition assays to evaluate mechanism of antiviral action, it was concluded that MDH-1-38 and its prodrug act as a virucidal agent and reduces transmission of infectious virus over multiple rounds of virus replication. This reduction in virus infectivity proved a challenge when passaging virus in the presence of MDH-1-38 and NS1040 in attempts to select for drug resistant HIV. Virus culture in the presence of increased concentrations over fourteen passages in the presence of MDH-1-38 or NS1040 did not result in resistance, which is unique compared to most HIV inhibitors that reduce virus replication by targeting a viral protein. Combination assays performed with representatives of the various classes of HIV inhibitors, MDH-1-38 and the prodrug NS1040 resulted in additive to synergistic interactions with all of the approved inhibitors, with the greatest levels of synergy observed with compounds which inhibited protease (ritonavir, lopinavir and nelfinavir). Most importantly, there was no significant combination antagonism or synergistic toxicity for any of the combination therapy assays at the concentrations tested. The evaluation for in vivo toxicity in rats showed that NS1040 is non-toxic, even at doses of 2000 mg/kg repeated for 14 consecutive days. A detailed pharmacokinetic analysis showed that NS1040 rapidly breaks down to MDH-1-38 in blood. Subsequent studies are underway to characterize the metabolites of MDH-1-38.",
