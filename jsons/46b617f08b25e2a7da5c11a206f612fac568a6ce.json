Testing of these designed immunogens will provide key insights into the ability to induce the desired immune responses, namely neutralizing antibodies. Many of these immunogens in human clinical trials represent only the first wave of designs and will likely require continued tweaking and elaboration to achieve the ultimate result of ever increasingly breadth and potency.

These antibodies typically target an essential component of the viral lifecycle, such as the surface glycoproteins that enable cell entry through binding to host receptors and facilitating membrane fusion. Such viral antigens include influenza virus hemagglutinin, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope, hepatitis C virus E2 protein, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F. Passive administration of antibodies that target these proteins, such as HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have proven effective in suppression of viremia in HIV-infected individuals [1, 2] [3]* [NCT02825797]. These studies provide proof-of-concept that if similar antibodies could be induced by a vaccine with sufficient potency, breadth and half-life, individuals could be protected from disease acquisition. A large clinical trial, known as AMP, is currently ongoing to test such a concept in HIV prevention, which will provide important benchmarks in terms of the titers and potency required to block transmission of HIV [NCT02716675 and NCT02568215, AMPstudy.org].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 663, "end": 666, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 667, "end": 669, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The remarkable progress in isolating antibodies from natural infection or immunization using functional B-cell screening or antigen specific B-cell isolation technologies [4] [5] [6] [7] has led to accelerated progress and advances in many fields and enabled the structural definition of key epitopes on viral surface antigens.

While many parallel pursuits are ongoing on a wide variety of viral and microbial pathogens, for the purposes of this review, we will focus here on RSV, influenza, and HIV, which have been the flagship pathogens for structure-based vaccine design and nicely highlight the different goals of the rational design process: immunofocusing, cross-reactivity, germline targeting, and somatic hypermutation.

For many widely employed vaccines, the induction of appropriate antibodies with high potency and durability is readily accomplished when humans are immunized with inactivated viruses or virus like particles (VLPs). However, for RSV F, VLPs do not induce the desired antibody responses, at least not to levels sufficient for protection. The primary hurdle in RSV is the large abundance of RSV F in its post-fusion conformation on the surface of VLPs. Antibodies that recognize this conformation are easily induced but are not protective, thereby acting as a distraction or competitor for efficacious responses to the prefusion conformation of RSV F. A potential solution to this problem came from stabilization of the prefusion conformation of RSV F, a feat that was accomplished by McLellan and colleagues in 2013 [10] . This stabilized form of the antigen preferentially induces neutralizing antibodies to the appropriate prefusion epitopes and provides an important proof-of-concept, which is currently being tested in clinical trials as a subunit vaccine [11] *, NCT03049488]. Characterization of antibodies induced to prefusion RSV F, along with their corresponding structures, will reveal the diversity in antibody responses and the most critical epitopes for protection, thereby enabling further opportunities for immunogen design aimed at focusing the antibody response even further. Similarly, the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) stabilized in its prefusion conformation is being tested in human clinical trials [NCT03699241, NCT04177355, NCT03783130]. This approach successfully induced a protective neutralizing antibody response in macaques to a single strain of HIV-1, demonstrating another important proof-of-concept that vaccine-induced antibodies can be protective against repeated viral challenge [12] *. Here, as with the seasonal influenza vaccine, the induced antibodies are quite narrow and strain specific.

Here antibodies must hone in on specific conserved, functional epitopes that are dispersed amidst surfaces that are variable and highly glycosylated. The large diversity of circulating HIV strains and the seasonal and zoonotic antigenic drift in influenza present enormous hurdles for achieving such neutralization breadth. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem is a highly conserved region, although less accessible compared to the immunogenic head region, on this surface antigen for which broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been discovered [13, 14] [ [15] [16] [17] [8, 18, 19] providing some hope that, with appropriately designed immunogens, such bnAbs can be elicited. Here, several concepts are being tested to achieve such cross-reactivity including headless or mini-HAs that dispense with the much more immunogenic head domain and present only the stem epitope [18, 19] [20] [NCT03814720], head-swapped chimeric immunogens that vary the HA head (usually zoonotic HAs that have not been seen by humans so as to reduce/eliminate memory recall responses), but keep the stem the same in attempts to boost stalk-specific responses [21] ** [NCT03300050] .

In HIV-1, the FP is much more accessible to antibodies compared to other viral glycoproteins, such as the HA, where the FP is deeply buried inside the structure in the prefusion state. One approach to focus the response on the FP is through repeated immunization with 10-100s of copies of the FP displayed on carrier proteins, such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH), followed by a booster immunization with the Env trimer spike to present the FP in a more native context.

Thus, researchers are testing the concept of activating particular germline B-cell precursors that are known to have such potential. This concept is most advanced for HIV where it has been shown that bnAbs often have very strict requirements, such as particular germline usage (V, D or J), long or short complementarity determining regions (CDRs), particular heavy-light chain pairing, etc. For the VRC01 class of CD4 receptor binding site (CD4bs) bnAbs, such requirements have been well defined including VH1-2 gene usage and light chains with a short 5aa LCDR3 (compared to the normal length of 8aa). The Schief lab has developed an immunogen, eOD, that presents the CD4 binding site epitope and have evolved it to bind VRC01-class antibody germline precursors [30] [31] [32] . In KI mice, this immunogen has been shown to stimulate such precursors and enrich for antibodies that have the appropriate properties. It was also demonstrated that the B cell precursor frequency and binding affinity to the eOD immunogen were critical determinants of successful expansion in germinal centers [33] *. This very well characterized and parameterized eOD concept is now being tested in humans with results expected in mid-to-late 2020 [NCT03547245]. Here, because VRC01-class antibody signatures are well defined, next generation sequencing (NGS) will be a critical tool in determining if the vaccine has induced and expanded the desirable precursors in the healthy human volunteers.

Here the problem becomes even more difficult due to requirements for long HCDR3 loops with junctional diversity that is not easy to control for eliciting particular CDR H3 sequences that are known to bind this composite glycan/ protein epitope. One important requisite for such research is profiling human antibody repertoires to identify and quantitate bona fide human B cell precursors in the human population, which is now an emerging field [35, 36] **,**]. Deep sequencing of human antibody repertoires therefore serves multiple purposes: validation of the germline targeting approach, identification of appropriate precursors for vaccine design, and benchmarks for the success of an immunogen to select for and enrich appropriate B cells upon immunization. Because animals each have a unique B cell repertoire, mice with human B cells expressing bnAb germline heavy and/or light chains have emerged as a critical model for assessing and improving germline-targeting immunogen strategies [37] [38] .

In the context of a protein subunit vaccine, the ability to drive SHM remains a much larger hurdle. Another issue is that key mutations for development of breadth are not found at traditional AID hotspots and these have been coined improbable mutations that represent hurdles in bnAb development [40, 41] *. Potential prime boost strategies can however \"shepherd\" SHM toward bnAbs, and proof-of-concept was demonstrated a number of years ago [42, 43] .

This study investigated the role of slowing down antigen delivery for improving antigen specific B and T cell responses in non-human primates. Immunogens were either delivered as a bolus, as fractional and escalating doses, or via slow delivery in osmotic pumps. Both of the latter methods induced superior germinal center responses as assessed by serial sampling of lymph nodes via fine needle aspirates (FNAs). FNAs also represent an emerging technology for immunogen design as they are only mildly invasive and do not require excision of lymph nodes, which of course quench ongoing immune responses and cannot be monitored over time.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ref #46"}, {"text": "a. This study engineered a phosphoserine tag onto the C-terminus of an HIV envelope trimer immunogen, which enabled it to attach to the adjuvant alum. Immunization with this adjuvant-antigen complex resulted in higher antigen specific B and T cell responses in germinal centers, similar to slow release of antigen as described in reference #46. Conversely, non-alum coupled antigen was cleared rapidly and had lower B and T cell responses. The authors also showed that antigen was trafficked to antigen presenting cells in complex with small plates of alum. This coupling of adjuvant to antigen, which provides a slow release depot, and multivalent presentation are likely responsible for the superior immune response relative to conventional vaccine formulations. Thus, this approach presents a practical approach to a slow depot delivery of antigen with a safe and widely used adjuvant. 14.

Further, the assay can be conducted in moderate throughput enabling near real time evaluation of immune responses to assess priming and boosting of desired antibody responses.

Because many of the targets being pursued are envelope glycoproteins that mediate viral entry into the cell, they are metastable and adopt different conformations to carry out their function. (A) In the case of RSV F, many mutations have been introduced to stabilize the prefusion conformation, which is the preferred state that can be targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. (B) For influenza HA, the prefusion conformation is relatively stable, except at the low pH for membrane fusion, but many of the epitopes are undesirable or result in strain-dependent neutralizing antibody responses that are easily escaped. One strategy to focus on the more conserved HA stalk region is to eliminate the more variable HA head altogether, or make chimeric HA with a conserved stalk attached to variable heads for which there is no pre-existing immunity. (C) Many HIV Env bnAbs are restricted in their gene usage and place further constraint on vaccine design. One approach to overcome this hurdle is known as germline targeting in which an epitope is presented on a small scaffold and mutations introduced to bind very specifically, and with high affinity, to a particular germline B cell precursor. (D) While there has been much success in structure-based antigen design, protein subunit antigens are not necessarily immunogenic on their own. Thus, many efforts are ongoing to understand how the immune system responds to protein subunit vaccines and development of new modalities for delivery and formulation, such as multivalent nanoparticles and slow release of antigen, as with alum depots.
