            "text": "High-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine providing sterilising immunity OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of a high-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine to immunise dogs against challenge with a field isolate of the virus. METHODS: Three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus-negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice, at 21-day intervals, with the vaccine and kept under observation. Two seronegative and virus-negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls. For safety tests, two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed. Faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations. Both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain. Blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge. RESULTS: Virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and PCR. Significantly, the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed. The two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis, and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge (dog 1) and two days postchallenge (dog 2), and by PCR for 23 median days. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed the efficacy of a high-cellpassage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity.",

In young pups, or when the virus occurs with concurrent pathogens, diarrhoea may be severe with dehydration, loss of appetite and even death (Appel 1987) . Infected dogs generally shed CCoV in their faeces for six to nine days after infection (Keenan and others 1976) , although the virus has been detected in faeces up to six months after clinical signs have ceased (Pratelli and others 2001a , 2002b , Pratelli 2006 . CCoV is highly contagious, and once the virus is established in a kennel, the spread of the infection is difficult to control. Crowding, unsanitary conditions, stress during training and other environmental conditions appear to favour the development of clinical disease (Evermann and others 1980 , Yasoshima and others 1983 , Pratelli and others 1999b , 2001b , Decaro and others 2004a . Disinfection of kennels and equipment with 3 per cent hypochlorite solution is effective in killing CCoV, but it does not prevent dog-to-dog transmission.",

The importance of this pathogen has been underestimated probably because of the difficulty in identifying the virus using conventional virological assays (Pratelli and others 2000) and in reproducing clinical disease in dogs under experimental conditions. Situations that cause stress in dogs, such as poor nutrition or overcrowding, and concurrent infections with other pathogens have been hypothesised to contribute to the severity of CCoV disease in field cases (Evermann and others 1980 , Yasoshima and others 1983 , Pratelli and others 1999b , 2001b , Decaro and others 2004a . Fulker and others (1995) produced clinical disease in dogs after CCoV inoculation, followed by treatment with the immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone. In that study, the authors showed that an inactivated CCoV vaccine could induce an immune response that protected dogs against clinical signs. Because CCoV, in the absence of immunosuppression, does not cause clinical disease in experimentally challenged dogs, monitoring the reduction of viral shedding has been used to test the efficacy of CCoV vaccines. In a recent study, it was found that the inactivated vaccine had poor efficacy in reducing faecal shedding of CCoV following infection with a field strain of the virus (Pratelli and others 2003b) . Subsequently, the safety and efficacy of a modified-live CCoV vaccine (strain 257/98-3c) was evaluated in 14 dogs. The study showed that there were no adverse reactions in dogs after the inoculation of the modified-live vaccine and that viral nucleic acid was detected by PCR for six dpfv in dogs that had been inoculated oronasally (Pratelli and others 2004) .",

For this purpose, the modified-live CCoV vaccine (Pratelli and others 2004) was further attenuated (60 passages) and tested for its ability to immunise dogs. Because CCoV is considered a poor immunogen, dogs were vaccinated twice by the oronasal route. Of interest was the significant immune response observed in the sera and in the faeces of all dogs after the second inoculation. After challenge at 14 dpsv, protection from CCoV infection was complete because no viral shedding was observed by either virus isolation or PCR tests. Protection against CCoV infections has generally been associated with the presence of specific antibodies on the mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal IgA in the vaccinated dogs (Table 2) might be responsible for the protection observed (Ogra and others 1980 , Saif 1996 , Murphy 1999 , Decaro and others 2004b .",
