            "text": "NK cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor resident in the bone marrow (BM) that is considered the main site of their generation. The BM microenvironment provides a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and allows intimate contact between developing NK cells and stromal cells, which is required for their full maturation (Roth et al., 2007). In the mouse, a lymphoid precursor (NKP) committed to the NK cell lineage has been identified (Di Santo, 2006; Rosmaraki et al., 2001). NKP cells express the common IL-2R/IL-15R beta chain (CD122) and the activating receptor NKG2D, and lack lineage markers. At the next stage of maturation, immature NK cells (iNK) express NK1.1 and CD94, along with the alphav integrin chain (CD51) and low levels of the integrin chain CD11b, and have poor cytotoxic and cytokine secretion capacity (Kim et al., 2002; Vosshenrich et al., 2005). The subsequent acquisition of Ly49 receptors is followed by an expansion stage that is characterized by upregulation of the integrin CD49b (defined by the DX5 mAb clone) and by the loss of CD51 expression; among this population, cells with increased expression of CD11b and of the mucin-like molecule CD43 are considered fully functional/mature (mNK). CD11blow NK cells predominate in BM and lymph nodes (LN), while CD11bhigh NK cells prevail in the blood, liver, spleen and lungs. The observation that in addition to mNK cells, NKPs and iNK are found in the spleen, LN and liver, suggests that also the latter populations can exit the BM under normal conditions and that final maturation of BM-derived NK cell precursors can occur also in the periphery (Freud et al., 2005). In this regard, we recently demonstrated that iNK as well as mNK cells can exit the BM in response to mobilizing stimuli, such as the CXCR4 pharmacological antagonist AMD3100 (Bernardini et al., 2008).",

In addition, homing to LN of a particular subset of activated NK cells has been described both in human and mouse (Fehniger et al., 2003; Martin-Fontecha et al., 2004). NK cells enter into LN stimulated with LPS-matured DCs or with selected adjuvants, become activated and provide an early source of IFN-\u03b3 that is necessary for T helper 1 polarization (Lucas et al., 2007; Martin-Fontecha et al., 2004). This evidence suggests that NK cells enter into LN to acquire effector capabilities through interacting with other cells of the innate immune system, such as DCs, and to modulate adaptive T-cell responses.",

Mouse CD11bhigh NK cells can be dissected into CD27high and CD27low fractions that differ in terms of expression of NK cell inhibitory receptors and of chemokine receptors and are functionally different. CD27low cells are mostly found in nonlymphoid organs (blood, liver and lungs). As compared to CD27high cells, they express a higher percentage of inhibitory receptors Ly49 I and C isoform and almost exclusively the inhibitory killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), and their cytotoxic and cytokine production activities are more tightly regulated (Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006; Hayakawa et al., 2006). The CD27high cells have many features similar to that of CD56high cells. They predominate in the LN and are extremely responsive to IL-12 and IL-18; but unlike CD56high cells, CD27high cells are also highly cytotoxic. Considering that CD56high and CD56low NK cells were also recently shown to express high and low levels of CD27, respectively, it has been suggested that this marker can also be used to better identify the two major subsets of human NK cells (Silva et al., 2008).",

CD16pos NK cells uniformly express high levels of CXCR1 and CX3CR1, low levels of CXCR2 and CXCR3 and no detectable levels of CXCR5. In contrast, CD16neg NK cells express high levels of CXCR3, express low levels of CX3CR1 and are negative for CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR5; moreover, both NK cell subsets express high levels of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha/beta)\u22c5 With respect to the CC chemokine receptor family, the majority of NK cells lack expression of CCR1-7 and CCR9, and only the CD16neg NK cell subset expresses high levels of CCR5 and CCR7, with the latter molecule mainly involved in the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs (Campbell et al., 2001).",

In this regard, NK cells migrate in response to the proinflammatory plasma protein chemerin, and that CD56lowCD16pos, but not CD56highCD16neg, expresses its receptor, ChemR23. Recently, a silent receptor for chemerin, CCRL2, has been also identified. CCRL2 is able to bind chemerin and to increase its local concentration and availability. Its expression and function on NK cells has not been clarified yet (Zabel et al., 2008). Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingophospholipid that influences lymphocyte trafficking as well as proliferation, adherence, and morphogenesis and is generated by the conversion of sphingomyelin into ceramide by sphingomyelinase (Matloubian et al., 2004). It was recently reported that human NK cells express the mRNA for S1P1, one of the five S1P G protein-coupled receptors, and that activation with IL-2 increases S1P1 and promotes S1P4 and S1P5 but not S1P2 expression; in addition, S1P but not sphingosine induces the chemotaxis of these cells (Kveberg et al., 2002; Maghazachi, 2003).",

We recently extended this observation, showing that CXCR4 expression is very high on NKP cells and progressively decreases during NK cell differentiation, and that NKP cells functionally express also CXCR3 and CCR1 that may participate to their recruitment from BM to specific organs (Bernardini et al., 2008). In addition, using C57BL/6 mice in which a green fluorescent protein cDNA was knocked in to genes encoding CX3CR1, we and others observed selective expression of CX3CR1 on the KLRG1pos/CD27low NK cell subset (Gregoire et al., 2007; Bernardini, unpublished observations) (Table 15.1\n).",

A significant decrease of CXCR3 expression on human NK cells treated for 6 h or 24 h with IL-2 and IL-12 alone or in combination has been reported, and the decreased expression was associated with reduced chemotaxis to CXCL10. Similarly, CCR7 receptor is down-regulated on NK cells after IL-2 activation, whereas the CCR4 and CX3CR1 molecule is induced on IL-2 activated NK cells. The same treatment did not affect the expression of other chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2 or CXCR4 (Hodge et al., 2002). However, previous reports have shown that short-term exposure of freshly isolated NK cells to IL-2 can positively modulate CCR2 mRNA expression (Polentarutti et al., 1997), and long-term (8\u201310 days) IL-2 stimulation results in increased expression of CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5 and CCR8 (Inngjerdingen et al., 2001).

            "text": "Besides migration, other human and mouse NK cell functions can be affected by chemokines. Indeed, chemokines can activate an NK cell defence machinery that may directly counteract an infectious agent by performing cytotoxicity or by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit and activate other effector cells (Taub et al., 1995). Those effects are well exemplified by the multifunctional role of the chemokine CX3CL1 in NK cell activation. Soluble and membrane-bound fractalkine induce IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells and affect NK cell ability to kill tumour cells both in vitro and in vivo (Guo et al., 2003; Yoneda et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2007). The CX3CL1-mediated pro-adhesive function is relevant in CX3CL1-promoted granule exocytosis and IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells during endothelial cell (EC) contact (Yoneda et al., 2000). These findings suggest that the expression of fractalkine at the site of inflammation can attract and activate NK cells through CX3CR1 and that NK cells, once activated, can lyse neighbouring ECs, promoting vascular injury (Umehara et al., 2004). This effect may have important implications in several pathological conditions such as graft rejection and tissue damage promoted by chronic infections (Bolovan-Fritts and Spector, 2008; Robinson et al., 2000). Enhancement of NK cell degranulation has also been demonstrated in response to other chemokines belonging to the CC family and to CXCL10 (Maghazachi et al., 1996; Taub et al., 1996). In addition, CC chemokines-mediated redistribution of adhesion molecules on NK cell surfaces may also increase NK cell cytotoxicity by promoting effector-target cell interaction (Nieto et al., 1998).",

IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells exposed to mature DCs was shown to be dependant on the CX3CL1 ability to promote redistribution of lipid rafts on NK cell membrane that excluded KIR2DL1 inhibitory receptor from the immune synapse leading to inhibition of ligand-induced KIR phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP1.",

In contrast, we demonstrated that human peripheral blood NK cells express Pyk-2 that is constitutively associated with the cytoskeletal protein paxillin but not p125 FAK. More recently, we have reported that NK cell binding to endothelium activates Pyk-2 and the small GTP binding protein Rac, a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Both Pyk-2 and Rac activation are coupled to integrins and chemokine receptors. By using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding dominant negative mutants of Pyk-2 and Rac, we demonstrated that both Pyk-2 and Rac are functionally involved in chemokine-induced NK cell migration through endothelium or ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 adhesive proteins. We also found that Pyk-2 is associated with the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin triggering but not with PIX, another exchange factor for Rac that is associated with paxillin through p95 PKL. Collectively, these results indicate that Pyk-2 acts as a receptor-proximal link between integrin and chemokine receptor signalling, and Pyk-2/Rac pathway plays a pivotal role in the control of NK cell transendothelial migration (Gismondi et al., 2003).",

A drastic decrease in NK cell numbers has been observed in the blood, spleen, and lungs of S1P5-deficient mice, associated with an increased number of NK cells in the BM and LNs. This altered distribution has suggested that S1P5 provides an egress signal to NK cells, promoting their exit from BM and LN (Walzer et al., 2007a). In addition, the observation that CX3CR1-deficient mice display a selective reduction of NK cell number in the lung strongly suggests that this receptor is important for the accumulation of at least one subset of NK cells in this organ under steady-state conditions (Yu et al., 2007). Also the expression of CXCR4 profoundly affects NK cell subset distribution likely by contributing to the maintenance of an NK cell pool within BM, as shown by the recruitment of BM iNK and mNK cells into circulation and spleen following in vivo delivery of the CXCR4 pharmacological antagonist AMD-3100 (Bernardini et al., 2008).",

During murine cytomegalovirus infection, NK cells migrate through a CCL3-dependent mechanism to sites of liver infection where they contribute to antiviral defence (Salazar-Mather et al., 1998). This evidence was further supported by the demonstration that CCL3-deficient mice show decreased resistance to cytomegalovirus infection that is associated with a dramatic reduction of NK cell accumulation and IFN-\u03b3 production in the liver. The recruitment of NK cells to the liver during infection required the receptor for CCL3, CCR5, and the receptor for CCL2, CCR2 (Hokeness et al., 2005; Salazar-Mather et al., 1998). IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of NK cells to liver has also been described in a model of Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis. In this case, NK cell entry in the liver was reduced in the absence of CCR1 and involved NK cells that used CXCR3 to exit the spleen (Wald et al., 2006).",

Accumulation of NK cells in the lungs has been also observed in mice with invasive aspergillosis. In this model, however, NK cell recruitment was mediated by CCL2, as neutralization of this chemokine resulted in a reduced NK cell number in the lungs and impaired clearance of the pathogen from this organ (Morrison et al., 2003). In addition, using an in vivo model of NK cell-mediated lung tumour cell clearance in CX3CR1-deficient mice or after treatment with blocking antibodies against CX3CL1 or CX3CR1, it has been demonstrated that decreased clearance of tumour cells following perturbation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 interaction is attributable to defective NK cell recruitment to the lung (Robinson et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2007). Using CXCR3-knockout mice, recruitment of NK cells in the lungs also participates in the pulmonary host defence against Bordetella bronchiseptica (Widney et al., 2005). In addition, a specific defect of NK cell recruitment to pulmonary granulomas was observed in CCR1-deficient mice (Shang et al., 2000).",

Interestingly, the entry of NK cells into the splenic red pulp is PTX-insensitive, thus suggesting that NK cell localization into this organ is regulated by a chemokine-independent or a PTX-insensitive chemokine receptor. The entry of NK cells within the T cell area of secondary lymphoid organs has several implications allowing their correct priming by DCs as well as an efficient T-cell polarization. Using a genetic approach to in vivo deplete CD11chigh DC, Lucas and coworkers showed that NK cell responses to viral and bacterial pathogens in vivo depend on their interaction with CD11chigh DC activated by IFN type I signals within the secondary lymphoid organs (2007).",

In these locations, NK cells can play an important role as active participants in directing DC maturation and T-cell response polarization and/or as cytotoxic effector cells.",
