The cause of CD is unclear and a complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immune components has been implicated.\n1\n The prevailing hypothesis for the pathogenesis of CD is that an aberrant immune response, generated against microbial agents in genetically susceptible hosts, results in chronic intestinal inflammation. Thus far, 71 genes have been implicated in CD based on genome\u2010wide association studies, and include genes involved in autophagy, maintenance of mucosal barrier integrity and immune regulation.\n2\n, \n3\n The NOD2/CARD15 on chromosome 16 was the first locus implicated, mutations of which are thought to affect bacterial recognition.\n4\n Subsequently, four genes, IL10RA, IL10RB, PSMG1 and TNFRSF6B, have been linked to pediatric CD.\n5\n, \n6\n The polygenic nature of CD suggests that direct targeting of individual disease susceptibility genes is unlikely to be therapeutically effective. Key molecules in pathophysiology, downstream of regulatory events induced by different causative factors are more likely targets for therapeutic interventions.",
