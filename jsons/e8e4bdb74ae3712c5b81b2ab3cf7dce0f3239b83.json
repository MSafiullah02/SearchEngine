            "text": "With the emergence of the second wave of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, there have been concerns that this pandemic may rival those of 1957, 1968, and even 1918 in which not thousands, but millions of people around the world died from the disease (> Table 113 .1). WHO is advising the countries of the northern and southern hemisphere to prepare for a second wave of H1N1 pandemic in which large numbers of severely ill patients requiring more and more intensive care infrastructure are likely to be seen, creating pressures that could overwhelm in hospitals and intensive care units, and possibly disrupt the provision of care of other diseases. The newly developed H1N1 vaccine is expected to reduce the impact of the second wave of H1N1 influenza pandemic in the population, especially, on high risk groups, with diminished complications, hospitalization rates, and mortality. On the other hand, previous H1N1 strains have developed antiviral resistance, and this, as well as mutation to greater virulence, remain concerns for the future. Past pandemics were characterized by several features that have been seen since March 2009: the rapid spread of a virus with novel antigenic determinants, a change in pathogenicity with high death rates in younger age groups, successive pandemic waves, apparent higher transmissibility than that of the seasonal influenza,; and differences in impact in different geographic region. The overall mortality in the previous century's three pandemics ranged from 1 million to more than 45 million deaths. In the three previous influenza pandemics, vaccines were not produced in time to have any substantial impact. Even though the technology of vaccine manufacture, produced in embryonated eggs, has changed little since the 1930s, there is some hope that vaccines will be available to mitigate the force of later waves of the current epidemic. In addition, several clinically useful antiviral drugs are now available, although there are still concerns about development of resistance.",

            "text": "The viruses that cause influenza are influenza A, B, and C belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which is characterized by segmented minus-strand RNA genome. Influenza A and B viruses' genomes consist of eight separate segments. These include the following: three transcriptases (PB 1 , PB 2 , and PA); two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (H or HA) and neuramidase (N & NA); two matrix proteins (M 1 and M 2 ); and one nucleocapsid protein (NP). Epidemic disease is caused by influenza virus type A and B. Influenza C viruses cause sporadic mild influenza-like illness in children. The focus of this chapter will be on influenza A virus, which may infect humans and birds, and most importantly has the capability of developing into pandemic virus. Influenza A virus has been divided into multiple subtypes, and the natural host for most of these is various avian species. In addition, influenza A viruses of a few distinct subtypes have been isolated from pigs, horses, seals, whales, and human beings, and the genome of the virus codes for two important surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (H or HA) and the neuraminidase (N or NA), have been identified. Based on both sequence and antigenic analysis, 16 distinct H (H1-H16) and 9 distinct N (N1-N9) subtypes are now recognized in animal and avian influenza viruses, but only 3 H subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) and 2 N subtypes (N1, N2) have caused extensive outbreaks in human beings. The influenza virus has a poor ability to proofread its genetic material while replicating, which results in frequent errors in progeny genes, and thus frequent mutations. When such minor changes occur in the H and N proteins, they result in ''antigenic drift,'' the slow but significant change in antigenicity that occurs over time in both influenza A and influenza B, and that requires periodic changes in the yearly vaccine. An example of such drift occurred during the 2003/2004 influenza season when the H3N2 circulating virus developed over 80% drift from the virus that was used to make one of the three major vaccine components that year ( > Table 113 .2). Further, marked changes in H, with or without similar changes in N, termed ''antigenic shift'' occur when new H or N gene segments are acquired by a process known as ''reassortment.'' This may take place by the mixing of genetic segments during dual infection of cells by a human and an animal virus. When such viruses containing reassorted gene segments are introduced into a population that has no pre-existing immunity, they may lead to a pandemic. This happened in 1957 and 1968.",

The infectious capabilities of a new virus that emerges in this way through reassortment are likely to be acquired from one or more of the human influenza gene segments. Conditions favorable for the emergence of an antigenic shift (reassortment) involve humans living in close proximity to domestic poultry and pigs. Pigs play an important role in interspeciestransmission of influenza virus. Susceptible pig cells process receptors for both avian and human influenza strains, which allow the pigs to serve as mixing vessels for the exchange of genetic material between human and avian viruses, resulting in the appearance of novel subtypes. Analysis of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic strain found that the emergent virus resulted from the acquisition by previously circulating human H1N1 of three new gene segments of avian origin (the H2 gene, the N2 gene, and one other). Similarly, the 1968 pandemic H3N2 virus acquired two new genes from an avian virus closely related to viruses isolated from ducks in Asia in 1963. In contrast, the 1918 H1N1 virus appears to have been an avian-like influenza virus derived from an unknown source. The currently circulating novel influenza H1N1 viruses that have been isolated around the globe during 2009 appear to have originated from two unrelated swine viruses, one of them a derivative of the 1918 human virus ( > Table 113 .3).",

In mid-April, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) identified swine origin H1N1 influenza virus in two specimens, independently collected in southern California. By the end of April, international spread and human-to-human transmission prompted the WHO to increase the pandemic alert from Phase 3 to Phase 4 and shortly after to Phase 5. On June 11, 2009, the WHO raised its pandemic to the highest level, Phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission on at least two continents ( > Table 113 The main route of transmission is respiratory through inhalation of largeparticle respiratory droplets, and possibly via droplet nuclei. Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact because these droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances (less than 2 m). Contact with contaminated surfaces is another possible source of transmission. All respiratory secretions and bodily fluids (e.g., fomites, diarrheal stool) of infected person should be considered potentially infectious. The secondary attack rates in households were estimated to be 27.3%, and in school settings, an infected school child was estimated to infect 2.4 other children within the school. The estimated incubation period could range from 1 to 7 days, but is most likely 1-4 days.

            "text": "Oseltamivir and zanamivir are generally well-tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were reported with moderate frequency among adults receiving oseltamivir for treatment (nausea without vomiting, 10%; vomiting 9%). In children treated with oseltamivir, 14% reported vomiting. Oseltamivir suspension is formulated with sorbitol, which may be associated with diarrhea, and abdominal pain in patients who are fructose-intolerant. Zanamivir is formulated for oral inhalation and is contraindicated in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive disease. As of November 18, 2009, 39 isolates (among more than 1,000 tested) of pandemic H1N1 were resistant to oseltamivir. Among . the 32 cases for which detailed information were available, 16 were associated with antiviral prophylaxis, and 3 had no history of exposure to oseltamivir. Resistance was associated with the common H275Y mutation, with retention of zanamivir susceptibility. Antiviral therapy is most effective when started within 48 h after the onset of symptoms; however, evidence suggests that treatment may benefit patients with prolonged or severe illness, even when started more than 48 h after the onset of illness. The recommended duration of treatment is 5 days. Hospitalized patients with severe infection might require longer antiviral courses. Some experts have advocated use of double doses of oseltamivir in critically ill patient, despite lack of published dates about efficacy. Zanavimir-inhaled formulation is not designed to be used in any nebulizer or mechanical ventilator as there is a risk that lactose drug carrier can obstruct ventilator equipment. For patients who are unable to take oral medication or in whom oral medication appears to be ineffective, peramavir, which is an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor formulated for intravenous administration, can be requested from the CDC under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and emergency use authorization, although studies on efficacy and safety are limited. Symptomatic patients who have highly suspected or documented oseltamivir resistance should not be treated with peramivir, because strains with the H275Y mutation have demonstrated reduced in vitro susceptibility to peramivir. These patients should be treated with intravenous zanamivir, which is an investigational drug that can be requested from the FDA for compassionate use. The CDC suggests limiting the use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis to specific groups. Antiviral doses recommended for treatment and prophylaxis of 2009 H1N1 influenza in adult and children are listed in > Table 113 .8. Clinicians should consider empiric treatment with antibacterial drugs if bacterial co-infection is suspected during or after influenza. Antibiotics selection should take into consideration, local data regarding frequency of pathogen causing secondary infection and pattern of drug resistance. When pneumonia is present, treatment with antibiotics should follow evidence-based guidelines for community acquired pneumonia.",

The 2009 H1N1 virus has the potential to cause severe disease, deaths, and potential socioeconomic dysfunction, and mathematical modeling suggests that the effect of the virus can be reduced by immunization. Two types of H1N1 vaccines have been prepared and have received approval from the FDA or the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) for use in the prevention of influenza caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Both ''adjuvanted'' and ''unadjuvanted'' vaccine formulations are available. An adjuvant is a substance that boosts the immune response. It is made up of naturally occurring oil, water, and vitamin E. The ''unadjuvanted'' vaccine does not include this material. Vaccination campaigns are currently underway to protect populations from pandemic H1N1. Preliminary data indicate that both vaccines are safe and immunogenic. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends that vaccination efforts should focus initially on persons in five target groups at high risk for influenza related complications ( > Table 113 .9).",

The side-effect profile of the H1N1 vaccine (''adjuvanted'' and ''unadjuvanted'') , particularly the frequency and severity of solicited adverse events, is consistent with previous experience from seasonal influenza vaccine. To date, less than ten suspected cases of Guillan-Barre syndrome have been reported in people who have received vaccines. These numbers are in line with normal background rates of this illness as recently reported. All such cases are being investigated to determine whether these are randomly occurring events or whether they might be associated with vaccination. WHO has received no reports of fatal outcome or confirmed cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, since the H1N1 vaccination campaigns began. All cases have recovered. Intense active monitoring for rare adverse reactions of H1N1 vaccine is ongoing, but all data compiled to date indicate that pandemic H1N1 vaccines match the excellent safety profile of the seasonal influenza vaccines which has been used for more than 60 years.",
