During the outbreak, there was an unusual amount of mixed infections with severe gastrointestinal symptoms (29). Fifty stool samples from children connected to the Nokia outbreak were tested during our study, and we found eight HBoV1\u2010positive cases (all of these were mixed infections) and two HBoV2\u2010positive cases (one was a mixed infection). Even if all \u2018Nokia cases\u2019 were excluded from the calculations, the differences between HBoVs (separately for HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV3) in AGE and control groups did not change outstandingly.",

Arthur et al.

Similar rates (approximately 74\u201380%) have been detected in earlier studies in which other gastroenteritis viruses have been investigated using adequate methods (20, 21). In such co\u2010infections, it is reasonable to assume that the known gastroenteritis viruses actually have a causative role and HBoV may be either shed from the respiratory tract or infecting the intestinal tract with no pathogenic role in AGE.
