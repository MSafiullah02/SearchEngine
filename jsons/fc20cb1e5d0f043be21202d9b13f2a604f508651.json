One approach to delineating the molecular pathways of IFN efficacy is through the use of gene expression profiling technologies. In this proof-of-concept study, different (0, 50, 200 and 800 units) oral doses of natural bovine IFN (type I) were tested in cattle to determine if oral IFN altered the expression of genes that may be pivotal to the development of systemic resistance to viral infections such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Oral IFN was administered twice: Time 0 and 8 h later. Blood was collected at 0, 8 and 24 h after the first IFN administration, and DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was employed in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) microarray assays. Within 8 h, 50 and 200 units of oral IFN induced significant (P < 0.05) changes in expression of 41 of 92 tested autoimmune and inflammatory response-associated genes.

The effects of oral IFN on the expression of the specific cytokine/cytokine interaction genes identified in these studies merit further investigation. One concern involved the up-regulation by IFN of IL10 and IL10R. These two genes encode a cytokine and cytokine receptor, respectively, known to have Th2-type (anti-inflammatory) effects, whereas IFN, notably IFN-gamma, is thought to favor Th1-type immune responses (Kidd, 2003) . Treatment of the IFN at pH 2.0 inactivated IFNgamma and IFN-beta. However, the IFN (type I, alpha) used in these studies can have pleiotropic biological activities, including antiviral activity, antiproliferative effects, and stimulation of cytotoxic activity (Pestka, 1997; Pestka et al., 2004) . In fact, type I IFN-induced production of IL-10 and its receptor has been reported in the literature (Piazzolla et al., 2000; Levings et al., 2001; Corre et al., 2013; Touzot et al., 2015) . These data suggest that subspecies of IFN present in the existing formulation is/are affecting IL10 and IL10R gene expression. Importantly, these data provide direct evidence for systemic modulation of the immune response by very low doses of orally administered IFN in an outbred domestic animal species. Systemic activation of this protective antiviral effect appears to extend into various aspects of innate and developing immune responses and can be expected to provide additional systemic beneficial effects to FMDV-challenged livestock as it has for other viral infectious diseases of animals (Cummins et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1118, "end": 1130, "text": "(Kidd, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1407, "text": "(Pestka, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1428, "text": "Pestka et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1556, "text": "(Piazzolla et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1578, "text": "Levings et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1598, "text": "Corre et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1619, "text": "Touzot et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2243, "text": "(Cummins et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "FMDV, a viral pathogen of ruminants and swine, is an icosahedral 25-30 nm single-stranded RNA virus, genus Aphtovirus, family Picornaviridae.

The prevalence of serotypes/strains varies by geographic region; FMDV type O is the most prevalent. Depending upon the strain and species affected, morbidity may reach 100%; mortality in adults is typically less than 1%. Young animals develop FMDV-associated myocarditis and endocarditis and are more likely to die from the direct effects of FMDV infection (Alexandersen et al., 2003; Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . Cattle typically present with fever, anorexia, and reduction in milk production; excessive salvation is often seen. Vesicular lesions develop on mucous membranes, interdigital spaces, and coronary bands within two to three days after infection. In swine, vesicular lesions develop on coronary bands and may also be found on snout, udder, hock and elbow. Smaller ungulates (sheep and goats) develop mild vesicles in the oral cavity, bulbs of the heel and coronary bands (Alexandersen et al., 2003) . Vesicles containing infectious virions rupture one to two days after formation, which facilitates spread of the infection to other animals and contamination of the environment. There is particular concern about FMDV because of its potential adverse economic impact upon livestock production and also because of embargos that will be placed upon US and Canadian meat products prepared for export should FMD occur in North America. The last FMD outbreak in the US was in 1929 and the last outbreak in Canada was in 1951 (Fenner et al., 1987) . However, several recent FMDV outbreaks have occurred outside the US (OIE, 2015) and, like recent experiences with novel swine coronaviruses (Stevenson et al., 2013) , could easily reach North America. While serotype-specific vaccination(s) can control FMDV, not all strains within a serotype are responsive to vaccinations and new FMDV strains may emerge by mutation(s) (USDA, 2013). Thus, FMDV control and containment time may be lost while strain-specific vaccine(s) are produced, distributed and then administered to susceptible livestock. Accordingly, an effective antiviral therapeutic agent would be useful for controlling FMDV outbreaks until vaccines are available. It is known that FMDV is inhibited by IFN (Richmond and Hamilton, 1969; Richmond and Campbell, 1973) . Conversely, as a part of its intracellular replication strategy, FMDV is known to inhibit production of intracellular IFN-alpha/beta (\u2423/\u2424) (Chinsangaram et al., 1999) and, via its double-stranded (ds) RNA viral intermediate, block intracellular dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), a central intracellular IFN-inducible antiviral pathway (Chinsangaram et al., 2001) . A stable resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin) interacts with FMDV VP1 protein to inhibit the type I IFN response . Thus, induction of endogenous IFN or treatment with exogenous IFN could help control FMDV under field conditions by providing IFN otherwise blocked by blocked by FMDV anti-IFN mechanisms. Both infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) herpesvirus and coital vesicular exanthema viruses inhibit FMDV infections by IFN induction (Straub and Ahl, 1976) . Similarly, synthetic IFN inducers (Poly I:C and/or ICLC) inhibit FMDV in animal models of FMDV infection (Richmond and Hamilton, 1969; Richmond and Campbell, 1973) and FMDV in pigs (Cunliffe et al., 1977; Dias et al., 2012; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014) . A related IFN induction strategy is use of recombinant replication-defective viruses containing IFN production genes within the viral genome Wu et al., 2003; Moraes et al., 2003; Dias et al., 2011 Dias et al., , 2012 Perez-Martin et al., 2012) . Some chemical IFN inducers are too toxic to be useful in the management of FMDV in livestock (McVicar et al., 1973; Cunliffe et al., 1977) but Poly ICLC and Poly I:C are reported to be effective adjuvants for FMDV vaccines Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014) . Regardless, toxicity is not a factor with viral IFN induction (McVicar et al., 1974) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 638, "end": 665, "text": "(Alexandersen et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 666, "end": 689, "text": "Grubman and Baxt, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1188, "text": "(Alexandersen et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1730, "text": "(Fenner et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1897, "text": "(Stevenson et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2478, "text": "(Richmond and Hamilton, 1969;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2507, "text": "Richmond and Campbell, 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2676, "text": "(Chinsangaram et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2851, "end": 2878, "text": "(Chinsangaram et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3336, "end": 3358, "text": "(Straub and Ahl, 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3466, "end": 3495, "text": "(Richmond and Hamilton, 1969;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 3496, "end": 3524, "text": "Richmond and Campbell, 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3542, "end": 3565, "text": "(Cunliffe et al., 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3584, "text": "Dias et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3585, "end": 3615, "text": "Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3759, "end": 3775, "text": "Wu et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 3776, "end": 3796, "text": "Moraes et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 3797, "end": 3814, "text": "Dias et al., 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3815, "end": 3834, "text": "Dias et al., , 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3835, "end": 3861, "text": "Perez-Martin et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3957, "end": 3979, "text": "(McVicar et al., 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3980, "end": 4002, "text": "Cunliffe et al., 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4087, "end": 4117, "text": "Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4182, "end": 4204, "text": "(McVicar et al., 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of IFN against FMDV are not all known but a correlation is reported between protection and specific ISG up-regulation and tissuespecific infiltration of dendritic cells and natural killer cells (Moraes et al., 2007; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2010) .

Because the effects of oral IFN were manifested strongly by 8 but not 16 h after treatment, it will probably be necessary to provide IFN in feed or water 2 or more times per day. The livestock industry has a history of adapting to any new useful technology. Automatic systems for the production of balanced rations for animals and food production consumption are in wide use for delivery of micro-ingredients (amino acids, mycotoxin binders, organic acids, vitamins and trace minerals) into batching processes to improve accuracy of delivery of micro-ingredients to increase efficiency of production. These systems are used widely in manufacturing many beef, dairy, swine and poultry feeds. The system is operated by a control unit that delivers specified amounts/types of micro-ingredients (milligrams or micrograms per head per day) by weighing the premix of the product into the ration based on intake in PPMs. Different micromachines are approved by FDA for mixing FDA-approved drugs for disease or improvement of animal efficiency. It would be a simple matter to determine if the expected feed intake per animal can be balanced with an effective dose of IFN. Automated delivery trials for IFN have already been tested.
