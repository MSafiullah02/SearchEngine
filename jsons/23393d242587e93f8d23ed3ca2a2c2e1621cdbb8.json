            "text": "Endophytes are the group of microorganisms that reside to internal and healthy tissues without causing negative symptoms to their host plant. Endophytes are extremely diverse and range from fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. Development of drug resistance to pathogenic forms of bacteria, fungi and other microbes, emergence of lethal viruses, the perpetuating epidemics in developing and under developing countries, and multifold fungal infection, enhancement in human population globally, all shows our inability to overcome these biomedical problems. In addition to this, we are also unable to assure people towards enough food security in specifi c regions of the earth due to infestation of different plant diseases. Since the fungal endophytes are relatively less studied group of microbial fl ora, but are responsible for several prospects such as biodiversity, ecology, bioactive metabolites (metabolomics) and nanotechnology, may enable us to overcome the above mentioned problems. Fungal endophytes represent a dependable source of specifi c secondary metabolites and can be manipulated both physicochemically and genetically to increase yield of desired compounds and to produce novel analogues of active metabolites. In this chapter, we have discussed several bioactive compounds and classifi ed them in to different classes as per their properties such as antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial, anticancer, antioxidants, antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents derived from fungal endophytes with their hosts and made the chemical structures A. Mishra et al. for 73 compounds using chemdraw 3D ultra version 7.0. These bioactive products are related to human health with MIC/EC/IC 50 values less that 50 m g/mL. This article also discusses nematicidal, some antimicrobial volatile compounds (VOCs) that are related to plant protection and faecal disposal. Therefore, this chapter is not very specifi c and covers almost prospects of fungal endophytes which could be useful in biodiversity, agrochemicals, biotechnology, biomedical and nanotechnology in ecofriendly manner.",

            "text": "Originally, the term endophyte was introduced by de Bary ( 1866 ) and was assigned to all those microbes that reside inside the living healthy tissues of the plants. Later, this term was expanded as fungi and bacteria including actinomycetes, which spend the whole or at least a part of their life cycle colonizing inter-or intra-cellularly, inside the healthy living tissue of the host plant, typically causing no apparent symptoms of disease. Many workers defi ne the endophytes in different ways, but Bacon and White ( 2000 ) gave a conclusive and widely accepted defi nition of endophyte as 'microbes that colonize living, internal tissues of plant without causing any immediate, overt negative effect'. Endophytes are extremely diverse and range from fungi Carroll and Carroll ( 1978 ) , Petrini ( 1986 ) , Rajagopal and Suryanarayanan ( 2000 ) , Gond et al. ( 2007 ) , to bacteria Hallmann et al. ( 1997 ) including actinomycetes Verma et al. ( 2009a ) , but the fungi are most studied group of endophytes and among fungi the best studied endophytes are intercellular symbionts from ascomycetous family Clavicipitaceae in the grasses of temperate zone. The presence of endophytes was observed from algae to angiosperm studied till date Aly et al. ( 2010 ) . The literature suggests that endophytes augment resistance in their hosts against herbivores Brem and Leuchtmann ( 2001 ) , pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes Gond et al. ( 2010 ) , illness Clay ( 1990 ) , reduced seed production Rice et al. ( 1990 ) , temperature and salinity Redman et al. ( 2002 ) and also against drought and minerals Malinowski et al. ( 1997 ) .",

In search of these new and lead molecule/or drug, we have to fi nd out new and alternative resources, and endophytic fungi are one of them which could be explored for this purpose Kharwar and Strobel ( 2011 ) . After the discovery of taxol (billon dollar anticancer drug) from an endophytic fungus Taxomyces andreanae, research related to fungal endophytes got a great attention for rich and novel alternative source of natural bioactive compounds Stierle et al.

The number of research publications only related to secondary metabolites (115) from fungal endophytes during period of 2000-2009, itself indicates the attention of researchers to this fi eld of study Aly et al.

Since the fungal endophytes are relatively less studied group of microbial fl ora, but are responsible for several prospects such as biodiversity, ecology, bioactive natural products (metabolomics) and nanotechnology.

Actually, non culturable behaviour of these microbes and lack of precise techniques of isolation may be the reasons for not reporting them frequently from plants except a few reports (Verma et al. 2009a ) . The most frequently isolated endophytes are the fungi. However, at outset, it is important to note that the vast majority of plants have not been studied for any endophytic association. Thus, enormous opportunities exist for the recovery of novel fungal forms, including genera, biotypes, as well as species in the myriad of plants yet to be studied in different settings and ecosystem. Hawksworth and Rossman ( 1987 ) estimated there may be as many as 1.5 million different fungal species, while only about 100,000 have been described. As more evidence accumulates, estimates keep rising as to the actual number of fungal species. For instance, Dreyfuss and Chapela ( 1994 ) have estimated at least one million species of endophytic fungi alone.",

( 1991 ) . An endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis cf. quercina recovered from stem of Triptergeum wilfordii , produces a potent antimycotic, cryptocandin ( 2 ) (lipopeptide) and cryptocin ( 3 ). Cryptocandin showed activity against human pathogenic fungi Trichophyton rubrum (ATCC 28188), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATCC 28185) , Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) , Candida parapsilosis and Histoplasma capsulatum Strobel et al. ( 1999 ) . CR377 ( 4 ), a novel pentaketide possess anticandida activity extracted from endophytic fungus CR377 ( Fusarium sp.) inhabited the internal tissue of Selaginella pallescens . Cytosporones D ( 5 ) is trihydroxybenzene lactone that has been reported from two endophytic fungal strains, CR 200 ( Cytospora sp.) and CR 146 ( Diaporthe sp.) which were isolated from the tissue of Conocarpus erecta and Forsteronia spicata plants, respectively possess signifi cant anticandida activity . 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin ( 6 ) isolated from endophytic sp., residing inside Ginkgo biloba exhibit antifungal activity against Candida albicans , Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus niger , including the antibacterial activity Liu et al. ( 2008 ) . Chloridium sp. isolated as an endophyte from Azadirachta indica , produced the compound javanicin ( 7 ) a strong antibacterial naphthaquinone had also inhibited the growth of several fungal pathogens at MIC below 20 m g/mL Kharwar et al. ( 2009 ",

Taxol ( 33 ) is highly functionalized diterpene and is the fi rst compound possessing the taxane ring, isolated from the bark of the Taxus brevifolia (Pacifi c Yew) for the fi rst time by Wani et al. ( 1971 ) and named it as 'taxol'. Its effectiveness against ovarian and breast cancers make the drug highly valuable. For the fi rst time in history, Stierle et al. ( 1993 ) isolated this important compound from a fungus Taxomyces andreanae endophytically associated with Taxus brevifolia . After this discovery, a number of scientists isolated Taxol from different endophytic fungi associated with different hosts such as Bartalinia robillardoides and Pestalotiopsis terminalia e, the endophytic fungi of Aegle marmelos and Terminalia arjuna , Gangadevi and Muthumary ( 2008, 2009 ) . Camptothecin ( 34 ), another important anticancer compound previously known to be isolated from wood of Camptotheca acuminata plant was isolated from an endophytic fungus of Nothapodytes foetida , Entrophosphora infrequens and Neurospora sp. for the fi rst time by Puri et al. ( 2005 ) and Rehman et al. ( 2008 ) , respectively. This very compound with two of its analogues, 9-methoxycamptothecin ( 35 ) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin ( 36 ) also isolated from Fusarium solani an endophytic fungus of Camptotheca acuminata Kusari et al.

The similar nature of compound is also reported with vincristine ( 37 ) produced by Fusarium oxysporum , an endophyte of Catharanthus roseus , Tung et al. ( 2002 ) . Emindole DA ( 38 ) isolated from Emericella nidulans var. acristata an endophyte of a Mediterranean green alga showed the antitumor activity against 36 human tumor cell lines Kralj et al. ( 2006 ) . Leptosphaerone C ( 39 ) and penicillenone are the novel anticancer polyketides isolated from Penicillium sp. JP-1, an endophytic fungus associated to the Aegiceras corniculatum (mangrove plant). Leptosphaerone C showed activity against A-549 cells, whereas penicillenone exhibits cytotoxicity against P388 cells . An endophyte Alternaria sp., isolated from Polygonum senegalense (Egyptian medicinal plant) had produced three lactone compounds, alternariol ( 40 ), alternariol 5-O -sulfate ( 41 ), alternariol 5-O -methyl ether ( 42 ), and a phenol derivative altenusin ( 43 ) bearing cytotoxic activity against L5178Y cells Aly et al.

Now these days, the nanotechnology shows valuable scope in communication, energy, electronics, instruments, optical engineering, defence and security, cosmetics, bioengineering, nanofabrics, agri food industry, biomedicals and drug delivery. The nano food market is the fastest growing sector where this technology could be used in the production, processing and packaging. A nanocomposite coating process may improve food packaging by placing antimicrobial agents directly on the surface of the coated fi lm. Further, the research is carried out to the detection of chemical and biological substances for sensing biochemical changes in foods quality. As per the survey of Helmut Kaiser consultancy the nanofood market will surge from 2.6$ billion to 20.4$ billion by 2011 Verma et al. ( 2009 b ) . There are many chemical and physical approaches for synthesis of nano particles, but they are highly costly and hazardous to environment. Therefore, scientifi c community looks for ecofriendly, cost effective and an alternative technology, and the one step biosynthesis or green synthesis is one of them, which synthesizes nanoparticles of useful metals (Au, Ag, Cd, Pt, Ti, Zn and Pd) via biological tools such as Bacteria Yong et al. ( 2002 ) , fungi and actinomycetes Sastry et al. ( 2003 ) , , algae Brayner et al. ( 2007 ) and plants Narayanan and Sakthivel ( 2008 ) . Recently, a number of fungi including endophytic such as Fusarium semitectum, Verticillum sp ., Aspergillus , Fusarium and Penicillum fellutanum were successfully employed for synthesis of metal nano particles (NPs). Endophytic Aspergillus clavatus isolated from Azadirachta indica collected from Banaras Hindu University was effi ciently able to synthesize the silver NPs of 5-55 nm. These NPs showed the antifungal ( Candida albicans ) and antibacterial ( E. coli and Pseudomonas fl uorescens ) activity . Verticillium sp. isolated from Taxus sp., when challenged with ions of silver and gold led to biofabrication of silver and gold nanoparticles within the fungal biomass Sastry et al. ( 2003 ) . These examples are enough to prove the use and role of endophytic fungi in different aspects of nanotechnology.",

However, in recent years, the discovery of novel chemical compounds produced by endophytes has opened the fi eld to structural chemists, biochemists, and medical and industrial scientists as well. The endophytes based bioactive compounds/drugs can only be achieved through interdisciplinary cooperation of research including botanists, microbiologist, molecular biologists, structural chemist, biochemist and pharmacologists. Before dealing the endophytic research we must take care of the basics, such as (i) Location: It is one of the most important criteria as tropical and subtropical rain forests contain the largest diversity of plant species, and can be utilized to discover diverse species of endophytes for the identifi cation of novel anti-fungal and antibacterial natural products. In addition to these habitats, researcher should also consider other habitats such as those in the desert and high elevation Alpine passes.",

The discovery of \"Taxol\" a cytotoxic compound used in cancer therapy is made by both the fungal endophyte and the host plant (pacifi c yew), and also the discovery of vincristine and vinblastine from fungal endophytes of Catharanthus roseus are good examples of the potential bioactive compounds that may be obtained based on plant history. (iii) Communication: Very little, if any, is known about the consequences of fungal/fungal, bacterial/bacterial and fungal/bacterial associations and interactions, especially in planta . In some preliminary studies, it was found that the presence of one or more than one endophytes facilitate the production of bioactive compounds. Obviously, more efforts must be initiated in this area of research to be able to optimally harnessing the potential of endophytes. (iv) Distribution and abundance: Studies have shown that in some systems, the presence of endophytes is ubiquitous while in some systems very few endophytes colonize the tissues such as roots and stems. So, these studies beg one to as the question of \"What are the regulatory aspects involved in the differential in vivo and in planta distribution(s) observed?\" (v) Production: Aspects affecting the stimulation and subsequent production of bioactive compounds is an important variable to determine. Studies have indicated that the production of compounds is affected by the immediate environment. For example, when grown under in vitro conditions, an endophyte may successfully and constantly produce bioactive materials for a time, after which, production seizes. Additional research addressing the regulatory factors involved is required to determine how to induce the endophytes to produce the compound(s) in a steady fashion for successful commercialization to become a reality. The past history of endophytic research in India especially with fungi is not very encouraging. It seems that investigators that have started this research in India are still actively involved in advancing their research manifesto with this 'under studied' group of microbes and yet, have not advanced the fi eld signifi cantly. An exception to this statement only a few people are engaged and pursuing their research in this area consistently such as Prof. T. S. Suryanarayanan (Chennai), Prof Umashaankar (Karnataka), T. Amna and Sanjana Kaul (Jammu and Kashmir), Prof. H. S. Prakash, and K. R. Sridhar (Mangalore, Karnataka) and R. N. Kharwar (BHU, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh) . Their group is actively searching the various habitats of the countryside in van attempt to investigate microbe/plant associations. They have initiated the biodiversity and distribution patterns of fungal endophytes with some medicinal plants in India and have published several papers along this line. They have also isolated some bioactive compounds from different endophytic fungi inhabited to different hosts. Some other groups have also started research with fungal endophytes, but overall situation in India compared to countries such as China and Brazil, for exploration of bioactive compounds is still minimal. However, recently, several research groups have started displaying more attention and efforts towards the potential importance of endophytic microbes, especially fungi. About two dozen research groups throughout India are presently engaged in vigorous studies centered on biodiversity and hence natural products discovery from this untapped alternative resource. It has become apparent to many researchers that endophytic microbes have enormous potential for addressing and solving many problems of mankind. With the discovery of new compounds, collectively as a society, we may fi nd new options to protect our interests in agriculture, medicine and nanotechnology. Actually, the status of total published work by Indian researchers hardly approaching up to hundred, which shows a small representative potential of the possibilities that exists in this realm of study. If serious efforts were to be explored in India, with its vast and enormous plant diversity, and/or worldwide with all the collective habitat potentials, it boggles the mind in the possibilities we as scientists may unravel. As such, studies of this nature truly need to be supported not only by the scientifi c community, but society at large that will surely reap the benefi ts.",

The bioactive compounds to be obtained that are of interest are those that have activity against important plant and human pathogens/parasites (such as those causing malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and encephalitis, etc.,), which have either become drug resistant, and/or lack drug treatment (i.e., AIDS). In recent years, India has experienced an increase in AIDS and immuno-compromised patients. A search for safe and effective drugs to enhance the resistance capacity of patients would be of great benefi t and add quality to life. Discovery of novel antimicrobials against disease that can be used as weapons against virulent pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis would be greatly benefi cial. Unfortunately, in recent times, a high incidence of scientifically advanced and remote-operated terrorist activities in countries like India, USA, UK, Germany, USSR and France is a reality that needs to be urgently addressed. Required are the developments of compounds that can effectively nullify the potential adverse effect of biochemical attacks. Yet another concern is the inordinately huge population in India (more than one billion strong), all who require a safe, reliable food source for sustenance. Such goals may only be achieved once production of disease free crops is obtainable. Management of human fecal matter is yet another alarming issue if left unmanaged will result in unhygienic and potentially lethal conditions, especially in slums and localities of poorer people. India unfortunately is still suffering from several severe human diseases (tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy, etc.,) that have been successfully eradicated from other \"fi rst world\" countries. One of the primary reasons these disease persist is due to the development of disease resistance in these microorganisms against particular drug(s). Therefore, to overcome these problems, India as well as the world in general, needs to obtain a variety of novel antimicrobial compounds from biological sources to begin to address these serious issues. In general, fungi as a group hold enormous potential as a promising source of antimicrobials and tool for nanotechnology. Our studies indicate that this group of organisms reside inside healthy plant tissue (endophytes) without causing any detectable symptoms, and are capable of producing powerful natural bioactive compounds, biofules and nanomaterials. Therefore, we strongly feel that India, as well as the world, needs to make serious efforts to address the potential of endophytes for isolation and synthesis of natural products, biofuel and nanoparticles, and in so doing, help facilitate the development of options and ultimately, the rescue of humanity from annihilation.",

Approximately 60% of the new drugs produced during the period 1985-2005 were anticancer, antimigraine and antihypertensive agents derived from either natural products or based on natural products structure. In some instances, endophytic microorganisms have developed the biochemical ability to produce compounds similar or identical to those produced by their host plants as a result of gene recombination during the evolutionary process. Bioactive natural products from endophytic microbes have enormous potential as a source for novel medicinal and agricultural product development. Thus, there is an urgent need to facilitate the identity of appropriate natural products and the subsequent development of drugs based on them. Such needs add further credence to the importance of the need to preserve natural habitats, and in so doing, preserve plant and endophyte biodiversity. A concerted effort involving multiple organizations needs to be spearheaded in order to begin the daunting task of collection and cataloguing of endophytic microorganisms throughout the world. A better understanding of the biosynthetic pathways involved in the production of bioactive endophytic compounds by chemical and biochemical means is essential. Recent progress in the fi eld of molecular biology of secondary metabolites has given us better insights about how the genes encoding for these bioactive compounds are organized. Investigation of these microorganisms and their relationship to the host requires improved quantitative analysis. Interestingly, 02 biofuels of fungal endophytes origin have been discussed which certainly provide an alternative to gasoline in future and an integrated approach is required to explore this source of biofuel. Role of fungal endophytes especially against abiotic stresses has also been discussed and this may be used as tool in plant growth promotion using the endophytic microbes, biofabrication of nanoparticles (NPs) of noble metals is also one of the challenging and promising area under niche of nanotechnology as it has lower environmental impact than other techniques available. Several fungal endophytes have been identifi ed and used as potential microbes for biosynthesis (Green Synthesis) of various metals nanoparticles with different properties. Therefore, we may conclude that this group of microbes, in addition to other usages, may also play a crucial role in this cutting edge technology.",
