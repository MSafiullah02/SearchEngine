For example, as outlines in this anecdotal article, uric acid, HSPs, and hyaluronan (HA) polymers (held together by evenly spaced hyppos) have such hydrophobic binding sites. In the following, they will be described under the various subchapters concerned.",

The various intracellular native compounds including organelles and cell debris operate in the extracellular milieu as constitutively expressed native DAMPs, denoted here as Class IA DAMPs (for ACD and RN, compare Part V, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_17 and Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_19). Most of these DAMPs such as HMGB1 [2\u20134], HSPs [5\u20137], S100A8/A9 proteins [8, 9], and NAs [10, 11] can be directly sensed via binding to a variety of PRMs. These PRMs in terms of \u201cclassical\u201d PRRs include TLRs, CLRs, NLRs, ALRs along with other DNA receptors such as cGAS, and RAGE (for informing articles, see Refs. [10, 12\u201321]). Many of these Class IA DAMPs signal danger to the surrounding PRMs-bearing cells such as leukocytes and phagocytes to trigger sterile inflammation and to PRM-bearing DCs to elicit adaptive immunity. In addition, some of these Class IA DAMPs were shown to activate sessile PRM-bearing cells of the innate immune system such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and epithelial and vascular cells, thereby promoting repair and regeneration, for example, wound-healing processes following infectious/sterile injury-induced inflammation (for relevant articles, see Refs. [22\u201327]).",

Regarding their quick migration during electrophoresis, they were named after this property [29]. As a member of a subfamily of the HMG proteins, HMGB1 is both a nucleus-resident factor released following cell membrane rupture and\u2014under certain conditions\u2014a secreted (modified) protein (see also below, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_14). As an intracellular nonhistone chromatin-associated protein, it operates as a DNA chaperone under homeostatic conditions by binding the DNA double helix transiently and bending it reversibly. As a DNA chaperone, the protein enhances the formation of nucleosomes; contributes to the assembly of site-specific DNA binding proteins to their cognate binding sites within chromatin, including transcription factors that underwind DNA upon binding; and is involved in transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Indeed, HMGB1 is an extremely mobile protein. The entire pool of HMGB1 roams the nucleus, resting on a specific DNA site for only fractions of a second. The transient binding to chromatin enables HMGB1 to perform its activities in transcription and other nuclear transactions [30]. The native HMGB1 is constitutively expressed in almost all cell types, and to operate as a DAMP, it is passively released following ACD or RN. Of note, in terms of an inducible DAMP, HMGB1 is actively secreted in a processed/modified state during severe stress (for competent articles and reviews, see Refs. [31\u201334]).",

The tail interacts with the HMG boxes and may modulate their intermolecular interactions (for relevant articles, see [34, 39\u201342]) (Fig. 12.1). These separate structural motifs seem to function in different ways when isolated from HMGB1. Thus, several studies have identified the B-box domain as important for many of the pro-inflammatory properties of HMGB1 including cytokine release.

[32], HMGB1 is released passively during cellular necrosis by almost all cells, which have a nucleus, and signals neighboring cells of ongoing damage. These early findings were convincingly confirmed by in vitro studies on Jurkat T cell leukemia cells treated to induce necrosis in terms of ACD by freeze-thawing, heat, hydrogen peroxide, or ethanol [46]. Among treatments tested, freeze-thawing produce the highest levels of extracellular HMGB1. Similar lines of studies are in support of these findings by showing an important role for oxidative stress mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in inducing passive HMGB1 release from macrophages and monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner [47]. Indeed, there is now general agreement that the death modalities of ACD but also RN (i.e., necroptosis, pyroptosis, and NETosis, described in Part V, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_17 and Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_19) represent a huge source of the passive emission of this DAMP (reviewed in Refs.

Already in 2004, TLR4 and TLR2 were reported to be such candidates [67]: Murine macrophage cell lines transfected with dominant-negative constructs of TLR2 and TLR4 were found to show a decreased activation on stimulation with HMGB1. In particular, a decrease in NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene expression after transfection with dominant-negative constructs to TLR2, TLR4, or both, demonstrated that TLR2 and TLR4 are both involved in HMGB1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB [67]. Most crucial evidence in support of the notion that injury-induced HMGB1 is recognized by TLR4 came from the early seminal experiment performed by the Pittsburgh group [68]: TLR4-defective mice (C3H/Hej mice) exhibited less damage in the hepatic postischemic reperfusion model than did wild-type mice (C3H/HeOuj mice). Anti-HMGB1 antibody failed to provide protection in C3H/Hej mice but successfully reduced damage in C3H/Ouj mice. These Pittsburgh results demonstrated that HMGB1 is an early mediator of injury and inflammation in liver IRI and implicates TLR4 as one of the receptors that are involved in the process [68].",

            "text": "Once in the extracellular milieu, HMGB1 signals danger to the surrounding cells, triggers inflammation, and activates innate and adaptive immunity by interacting with multiple receptors mentioned above. Intriguingly, however, these various functions of HMGB1 vary depending on the redox state of this prototypical DAMP. Thus, the redox status of HMGB1 reportedly distinguishes its cytokine-inducing and chemokine activity. In fact, a large body of evidence has been published demonstrating that the redox state of cysteines modulates the binding of HMGB1 to its receptors and consequently its activities (reviewed by Venereau et al. [31]). The puzzle is based on three cysteines in positions 23, 45, and 106 possessed by HMGB1: C23 and C45 can form a disulfide bond, and C106 is unpaired. These cysteines are modified by redox reactions, causing three isoforms called fully reduced HMGB1 for the all-thiol form, disulfide HMGB1 for the partially oxidized one, and sulfonyl HMGB1 for the terminally oxidized form [74] (Fig. 12.2). Fully reduced HMGB1 has sole chemokine activity by creating a complex with the chemokine CXCL12, which binds with increased affinity to its CXCR4 receptor to promote recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of damaged tissues [66]. Conversely, the myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2), an extracellular adaptor of TLR4, binds specifically to disulfide HMGB1 but not to the other redox forms, thereby triggering the upregulation of chemokines and cytokines [75] (for MD-2, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22). Of note, interaction with MD-2 also requires the third cysteine, in the fully reduced form. Thus, the disulfide bond between C23 and C45 qualifies HMGB1 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, whereas further cysteine oxidation to sulfonates abolishes both the chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory activities of HMGB1 [45]. Also, reduced HMGB1 protein promotes autophagy, whereas oxidized HMGB1 fosters apoptosis (for autophagy and apoptosis, compare Part V, Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_18 and 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_19). Further and for clinicians essential to know, a correlation between the presence of the disulfide HMGB1 and the onset of pathologies could be clinically shown, for example, concerning brain injury, liver damage, myositis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (reviewed in [31]). Remarkably, disulfide HMGB1, and not the reduced form, contributes to nociceptive signal transmission via activation of TLR4 [76] (for nociceptors sensing exogenous DAMPs, compare below, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_15).\n",

            "text": "All organisms respond to heat by synthesizing a group of stress proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). These highly conserved biomolecules exist ubiquitously throughout the evolutionary scale, from archaebacteria to eubacteria, from plants to animals, and from animals to humans [81]. They are abundant across species in nearly all subcellular compartments. They are both constitutively and inducibly expressed. After a sudden rise in temperature of a few degrees, all cells immediately, but transiently, activate a small number of specific genes. Some of these encode HSPs. First observed in 1962, chromosomal \u201cpuffing\u201d owing to the \u201cunwrapping\u201d of chromatin for gene activation occurred after the exposure of isolated salivary glands of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to temperatures slightly above physiological levels [82]. By 1974, \u201cpuffing\u201d was noted to be accompanied by high-level expression of a unique set of HSPs [83]. Investigations on Drosophila showed that each of four members of a small HSP family was induced during development in response to heat stress via cell-specific enhancers in the gene promoter regions [84]. Investigations into members of different species soon revealed that cells produce neosynthesized proteins when exposed not only to an abrupt increase in temperature but also to other diverse toxic stress situations such as alterations in the intracellular redox environment or exposure to oxidants, heavy metals, alcohol, xenobiotics, or viral infection. For this reason, they are referred to as \u201cstress proteins\u201d and are divided into different families according to their molecular size, for example, HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40, and HSP20. One of the most intensively studied protein families is the 70-kDa HSP70 [85] (Fig. 12.1). As major stress-inducible proteins, the HSP70 family consists of ubiquitous HSP73 and of HSP72, which is inducible by heat shock, oxidative stress, and infection.",

The Srivastava group subsequently demonstrated that necrotic but not apoptotic cell death leads to the release of HSPs including gp96, HSP90, and the inducible HSP70 family member, HSP72 [87]. These investigators showed that exposure of DCs to necrotic but not apoptotic cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and subsequent maturation of DCs. In more recent times, these early studies were confirmed by several groups. For example, in in vitro experiments on cell lysates, HSP70 released from necrotic monocytes/macrophages was shown to function as an endogenous danger signal to augment the pro-inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophage [88]. In other lines of studies, HSP70 was found to be passively released from necrotic human prostate carcinoma cells lines treated with hyperthermia [89]. Together, there is sufficient evidence documenting passive release of HSPs form necrotic cells.",

Fine-tuning of TLR signaling in amplitude, space, time, and character is a key aspect of inflammatory reactions in health, homeostasis, and pathology.

Notably, recent studies were published indicating that CD14 is a co-receptor of TLR4 in the S100A9-induced cytokine response [121]. On the other hand, S100A12 and S100B are reportedly recognized by RAGE, whereby S100A12 has also recently been found to bind to TLR4 to induce monocyte activation [122]. Following recognition, both interactions are known to result in NF-\u03baB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [123, 124]. Interestingly, a model was recently proposed, whereby conformational flexibility in the RAGE receptor allows the adoption of a binding conformation for interaction with the stable hydrophobic groove on the surface of S100B [124].

The \u201cp\u201d refers to the phosphodiester link between consecutive nucleotides. Long dsRNA is sensed by TLR3, a receptor that was the first bona fide PRR identified as a sensor for dsRNA. TLR3 is not present in the cytosol of healthy cells and thus is regarded as receptor sensing dsRNA coming from outside the cell. Further, TLR7 senses even short RNA, preferentially double-stranded and containing guanine and uridine. The TLR8 functions as receptors for uridine-rich RNA molecules which are likely to be degraded from ssRNA fragments. Notably, TLR7 is expressed in B cells, pDCs, and macrophages, whereas TLR8 is expressed in macrophages and DCs.",

In fact, NA degradation by DNases and RNases has been recognized as a key role in preventing hazardous activation of NA sensors that may become deleterious for the host. For example, DNA degradation by lysosomal (and cytoplasmic) DNases is now known to prevent deleterious homeostatic activation of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways. As a matter of fact, crude NAs are not effective for stimulating NA receptors. Intriguingly, lysosomal TLRs are also dependent on NA processing in lysosomes. Thus, digestion of dsDNA by DNase II was shown to be required for TLR9 response to ssDNA. Furthermore, TLR7 and TLR8 respond to ribonucleosides and ODNs, instead of ssRNA itself, indicating a requirement for RNA processing. Nucleic acid-sensing TLRs themselves need to be processed by lysosomal proteases. Without processing, TLR8 and TLR9 were found to fail to form dimers. Together, as stressed [132], \u201cthe processing of NAs and TLRs has the key role in keeping NA sensors responsive to microbial NAs without inducing hazardous responses to endogenous NAs.\u201d",

Hard to believe but already more than 100 years ago, the Polish-German surgeon von Mikulicz-Radecki treated patients with severe surgical peritoneal infections with NAs and other similar substances. The aim was to induce massive hyperleukocytosis, which would increase natural resistance to the bacteria involved. Von Mikulicz-Radecki reported his clinical trial findings at the 33rd Congress of the German Society of Surgeons in 1904 (cited in [135]). Many years later, one of the first reports was published that historically documented the immunostimulatory potential of DNA, in fact, depending on a TLR-independent phenomenon [136]. Still, the mechanism of action of NAs was not understood until a couple of years ago. Today it is known that upon recognition of NAs, the endolysosomal TLRs and cytosolic sensors activate signalling cascades that culminate in the production of type I IFNs, which primarily include numerous subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 and a single IFN-\u03b2, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1\u03b2. Type I IFNs then\u2014now acting as DAMPs\u2014induce a vast plethora of antiviral genes through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Moreover, NAs have been shown to be involved in promoting sterile inflammation upon non-pathogen-mediated traumatic tissue injury [137].

When released from dying cells (succumbing to ACD or RCD such as NETosis) into the extracellular space, histones, that is, free histones and DNA-bound histones (nucleosomes), have been recently recognized as candidates of the DAMP family (for further reading, see Refs. [57, 138\u2013144]). As known, in eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin, the basic repeating unit of which is a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 147 bp nucleotides wrapped around a histone octamer, which is composed of two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Nucleosomes are packaged into progressively higher-order structures to form chromosomes ultimately. Notably, unstructured NH2-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome are subject to covalent chemical modifications, which impact chromatin organization and function (for more details, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_24, and Fig. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_24).",

In addition to histone-induced pro-inflammatory innate immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4, subsequent experiments on an in vivo model of hepatic IRI demonstrated that TLR9 KO mice were protected from histone-mediated IRI; these studies encouraged the authors to propose that exogenous histones may have acted as a cofactor that amplified the TLR9-mediated signalling brought about by endogenous circulating DNA released from dying cells [139].

Released during periods of cell death and immune activation, histone, nucleosomes and NETs induce cytotoxicity by altering cell membrane permeability to calcium ions, activating TLRs on innate immune cells, stimulating NLRP3 inflammasome and complement systems, resulting in a sterile pro-inflammatory environment. There are three distinct pharmacodynamic approaches to target histone-mediated inflammation, by reducing the release, neutralising or blocking histone signal transduction. Although these approaches have proven to provide significant protection from mortality in animal models of acute organ injury, further research is necessary to warrant their safe application in a clinical setting.\u201d",

Nevertheless, IL-33 was found to be able to associate with chromatin by tethering to histones H2A/H2B, via a short chromatin-binding motif, located in its N-terminal nuclear domain [150]. Biologically active full-length IL-33 can be immediately released in the extracellular space after traumatic cell death (necrotic cell death or mechanical injury) enabling instant alarm or danger signalling without the need for further processing or modification (see Refs. [151\u2013154]). Once released, the cytokine has been reported to operating as a canonical DAMP [155]; regarding this function, other authors denoted IL-33 as an \u201calarmin\u201d [156] or \u201cdual function-alarmin\u201d [157]). Following emission, IL-33 elicits extracellular effects by binding to the suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) receptor (see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22). Although full-length IL-33 is biologically active, cleavage generates mature forms of IL-33 with up to tenfold more biologically active compared to the full-length protein [158].",

In addition, after binding to FPs, these receptors promote pro-inflammatory responses including cell adhesion, directed migration, granule release, and superoxide production.

However, the most convincing proof for this proposal derived from a targeted experimental study showing that in vitro stimulation of murine spleen cells with exogenous cytochrome C results in activation of NF-\u03baB associated with increased production of neutrophil- and monocyte-triggered pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines into the culture medium [174]. More recently reported supportive studies on microglia-like cells suggest that the inflammatory effect of cytochrome C is at least partially mediated by TLR4-triggered signalling [175].

In mammals, F-actin is exposed on and released by necrotic cells that have lost plasma membrane integrity to bind to the PRM DNGR-1, a receptor that is expressed selectively by DCs [179]. Like Dectin-1, DNGR-1 is a transmembrane CLR that samples the extracellular and endosomal space and signals via Src and Syk (see Part II, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5). Following phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, DNGR-1 recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens.",

A high amount of free heme was shown to operate as a potential inducer and amplifier of the inflammatory response. For example, the molecule elicits multiple inflammatory responses, activating leukocytes and their migration, up-regulating adhesion molecule and cytokine expression, and augmenting oxidant production and lipid peroxidation [183\u2013185]. Of note, heme, but not porphyrins without iron, was demonstrated to operate as a DAMP promoting the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-primed macrophages [186] (see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22).

As will be outlined in detail in Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22, inflammasomes are macromolecular protein complexes that are composed of inflammasome-initiating receptors/sensors and inflammatory caspases, in the presence or absence of the inflammasome adapter protein ASC. A typical feature of members of this class of DAMPs is the fact that they do not directly activate inflammasomes via physical binding to NLRP3 but act through the promotion of molecular homeostatic perturbations in an innate immune cell which are then sensed by NLRP3 (compare Part II, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5). Such DAMPs include eATP at millimolar concentrations, K+ ionophores [189] and crystalline/particulate substances (e.g., MSU, cholesterol crystals, silica, alum), or other factors that cause lysosomal destabilization [190, 191]. As said, these activators are indirectly sensed without direct binding to NLRP3 to trigger inflammasome assembly, IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 release, and pyroptosis [192\u2013195] (for pyroptosis, see Part V, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_19).",

For example, in studies on pressure-disrupted or freeze-thaw-treated necrotic B16 cells, mitochondria-derived ATP was shown to be capable of activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [198]. Once released into the extracellular space, ATP like ADP is rapidly metabolized to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which in turn is metabolized to adenosine. This nucleotide phosphohydrolysis involves a two-step enzymatic process regulated by ectoenzymes. In the first step, ATP and ADP are both converted to AMP through the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (CD39) (reviewed in [199]). To function as a DAMP, eATP initially triggers signalling through the activation of purinergic P2 receptors [200]. As outlined in Part II, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5, these receptors have a widespread expression throughout different tissues and are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. As also mentioned in Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5, P2 purinoceptors can be further subdivided into metabotropic P2YRs, which are G-protein-coupled, and ionotropic P2XRs, which are non-selective nucleotide-gated ion channels. Of note, it is the P2X7 receptor through which eATP leads indirectly to canonical NLRP3 activation under involvement of hemichannels of pannexin-1 [192, 194, 201, 202].",

In patients suffering from hyperuricaemia as a consequence of too much intake of purines and/or genetic predisposition, uric acid saturates body fluids and may be converted to MSU crystal when deposited in joints and other tissues, thereby causing gout and other inflammatory diseases (reviewed by Rock et al.

In 2003, uric acid was identified by the Rock group as a major DAMP and later on shown in mice to promote an acute inflammatory response when released as crystals from dying cells [205, 206]. Once released into the extracellular space and engulfed by phagocytosing cells such as macrophages, the MSU crystals/particles are sensed by NLRP3 resulting in activation and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It is suggested that the MSU particles cause the rupture or leakage of lysosomes or phagosomes associated with release of cathepsin B into the cytosol, thereby leading to molecular perturbations of the cell sensed as dyshomeostatic DAMPs by NLRP3 [190, 207, 208]. This process has been known as \u201cfrustrated phagocytosis\u201d wherein the phagocytosed crystals cannot be engulfed entirely or digested, thereby leading to changes in the structure of the Golgi complexes like fragmentation and reorganization of Golgi membranes [209]. These perturbations reflect bona fide dyshomeostatic DAMPs which are genuinely sensed by NLRP3. Yet, other mechanisms are also discussed to contribute to NLRP3 activation, such as MSU crystal-promoted K+ efflux reflecting also molecular perturbations that are, as mentioned above, thought to be involved indirectly in ATP sensing (for dyshomeostatic DAMPs, see below, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_13; for mechanisms of NLRP3 activation, including particulate-mediated activation, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22).",

For this scenario, cholesterol is well known to play a critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis that is now regarded as a chronic innate immune inflammatory disease induced by chronic-repetitive infective or sterile injury of the vessel wall. The disorder is further characterized by lipid deposition, leukocyte and macrophage infiltration, and proliferation of VSMCs [216\u2013218] (for VSMCs, see Part III, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_9).

            "text": "First evidence for a role of DAMPs in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance were reported from studies in mice showing that obesity activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by sensing the lipid molecule ceramide, which is composed from sphingoside and fatty acid [225, 226]. Other lines of studies in rodents confirmed these observations by uncovering further metabolic stress-induced lipid species acting as NLRP3-activating DAMPs. Thus, in a working model in which free fatty acids activate inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion from myeloid cells, the investigators found that that elevated fatty acid caused by a high-fat diet was capable of activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via a ROS-dependent signalling pathway. Remarkable from these experiments was the observation that IL-1\u03b2 induced by fatty acid prevents normal insulin signalling in multiple insulin target tissues, ultimately resulting in insulin resistance [227]. Doubtlessly, for clinicians, this finding explicitly explains the development of insulin resistance in obese patients, at least partially. Also, in experiments on murine LPS-treated macrophages, it could be demonstrated that ingested palmitate, a saturated fatty acid ester, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in a lysosome-dependent release of IL-1\u03b2 [228]. In their conclusion, the authors also discuss a potential mechanistic role of lysosome destabilization and cathepsin B.",

This activating receptor is expressed on the surface of NK cells, iNKT, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, CD8+ MAIT, CD8+ T cells, and subsets of CD4+ T cells (compare Part VII, Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_27, 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_28, and 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_28). The receptor NKG2D serves as a major recognition receptor for this class of DAMPs to detect and eliminate cells, which are stressed as transformed or infectively and sterilely damaged cells. On healthy cells, these endogenous IB-2 DAMPs (also called NKG2D ligands) are expressed at a low level only, but their expression is markedly induced on such stressed cells, whereby they translocate (probably from the stressed ER [262]) to the plasma membrane to get anchored and exposed.",
