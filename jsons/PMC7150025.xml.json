Many viruses identified in feces, including reoviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses, have the capacity to replicate in the intestine without causing clinical symptoms. Other viruses detected in feces may be derived from swallowed secretions originating in the respiratory tract, from plant viruses ingested in food, or from phages released after bacterial lysis. Many viruses use the gastrointestinal tract as a portal of entry and may replicate there before initiating systemic disease (e.g. poliovirus, hepatitis A and E). A diverse group of viruses (rotaviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses) replicate in the epithelial cells lining the small intestine, causing sufficient destruction to result in the symptoms of enteric infection, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever and dehydration. A further group of viruses of systemic origin (e.g. measles virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) may multiply in gut-related cells, again causing symptoms of enteritis.",

They cause life-threatening diarrhea, predominantly in young children aged 6\u201324 months, and epidemics of mild to severe diarrhea in newborn animals and birds. Newborn babies are susceptible to infection, but this is often asymptomatic, either because rotaviruses adapted to growth in the neonatal intestine are naturally attenuated and/or because maternally derived antibody reduces the severity of symptoms. Reinfections occur regularly thoughout life. Group A rotaviruses have a worldwide distribution and cause 20\u201345% of disease in children admitted to hospital. Seasonal epidemics occur in children during the colder months of the year. Infection is endemic throughout the year in tropical countries. Group A rotaviruses present an almost limitless spectrum of genetic variation, but\nantigenic variation appears more restricted. Rotaviruses are species-specific, although cross-species infections can be induced under experimental conditions. When this occurs, rotavirus replication is minimal, thus reducing the likelihood of horizontal transmission of infection. Occasional zoonotic infections have occurred in humans. There is a potential for human and animal strains to reassort in nature. During natural group A rotavirus infections, as many as 1010 particles ml\u22121 are shed in feces.

This was followed by the description of many other small viruses implicated in gastroenteritis outbreaks. Most of these viruses were named after their geographical origin, e.g. Hawaii agent, Snow Mountain virus, Sapporo virus, Mexico virus, but now are known to have worldwide distribution. Identification and classification within HuCV took an enormous leap forward with the development of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction primer-based hybridization assays, and enzyme immunoassays using recombinant antigens. Preliminary genetically based classification now recognizes three HuCV genogroups represented by Norwalk virus (NV), Snow Mountain agent (SMA) and Sapporo virus. The Sapporo virus genogroup has been detected in 0.5\u20136.6% of sporadic gastroenteritis in hospitalized children. The NV and SMA genogroups have predominantly caused outbreaks of diarrhea (in all age groups) as a result of ingestion of contaminated food/fluids. Etiological surveys undertaken in the USA have shown that approximately 65% of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in camps, cruise ships, nursing homes, schools and families have been associated with excretion of HuCV. HuCV are still recalcitrant to growth in vitro, and these viruses have not been visualized in intestinal tissue, despite repeated attempts.",

In vivo replication in these cells produces similar histopathological changes in the intestine of animals and humans. Rotaviruses, Norwalk viruses, astroviruses and caliciviruses preferentially infect the upper small intestine, whereas adenoviruses, toroviruses and coronaviruses commonly infect the lower small intestine. Toroviruses also infect the colon. Most enteric viruses have been detected in M cells overlying lymphoid tissue, but do not appear to replicate in lamina propria or lymph nodes. Parvoviruses (and Breda viruses) also infect crypt cells. Only parvoviruses have been conclusively shown to have a viremic phase.",

Initially, epithelial cells (infected and uninfected) are stripped from the sides and tips of villi, which may be denuded. Villi become stunted, and are covered with nonabsorptive cells derived from mitosis of crypt cells. The intestine is rapidly repopulated by mitosis of crypt cells, resulting in restitution of normal villus architecture covered by new mature absorptive villus cells. Crypt cell hyperplasia may be mediated via the hormone enteroglucagon, levels of which are raised in calves after enteric virus infections. The availability of newly regenerated absorptive cells may lead to a brief second wave of viral replication.",

Specific antibodies detectable in intestinal contents and feces (of immunoglobulin IgA, IgM class) and serum antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM class) appear during the first week after onset of infection. Serum antibody levels cannot be used as predictors of immunity to reinfection. The level of ingested or persisting antibody in the intestinal lumen can be predictive of immunity. Longitudinal studies of rotavirus infection in children (in developed and developing countries) show that primary infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) does not confer immunity to reinfections, which are frequent, but does result in clinical immunity to development of\nsevere symptoms during reinfection (Fig. 8\n). Immunity to caliciviruses following infection appears to be influenced by the infecting agent. Sporadic pediatric infections (due to Sapporo viruses) are associated with long-lived immunity. However, immunity to HuCV after epidemic outbreaks (in older age groups) is short-lived with no apparent protection against reinfection with the same viruses. Adult volunteers given Norwalk virus orally on more than one occasion were either repeatedly ill or persistently well. Volunteer studies with Norwalk virus show that approximately 50% of adults have an inherent resistance to infection (and disease) that has no detectable immunological basis. Cell-mediated immune responses have been demonstrated after rotavirus infection, and are important for cessation of virus excretion. Their role in long-term immunity is not known.",
