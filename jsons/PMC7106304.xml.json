Both dichotomous and quantitative traits can be analyzed in GWASs, and the genomes can be those of unrelated subjects or derive from samples with familiar structure (e.g., parent-affected child trios). Because GWASs analyze variants distributed throughout the genome, they are unbiased with respect to prior biological knowledge, offering the potential to identify novel variants and genes associated to the trait of interest.",

After those early efforts, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium large-scale study in 2007 (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007) gave way to the GWAS era. In recent years, hundreds of GWASs have been published. Their results are stored in a dedicated database, the GWAS Catalog, presently hosted by the EMBL-EBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) (MacArthur et al., 2017).

            "text": "We mined the catalog to obtain a global overview of the application of GWAS in the field of infectious diseases. We classified studies and associations in broad categories depending on the disease or trait they analyzed. The category \u201cinfectious disease\u201d was intended in a very broad sense: for instance, it included virus-associated cancers, specific phenotypes associated with infections (e.g., mood disorders in prion disease), and hematological measurements related to infectious agents (e.g., antibody levels for common infections, cytokine production during septic shock). We also defined categories for response to therapy, by classifying GWAS that analyzed the response to treatments for infectious diseases, non-communicable conditions, and vaccines. Overall, 4%, 0.66%, and 0.31% of all studies in the catalog were classified in the categories \u201cinfectious disease\u201d, \u201cresponse to treatment for infectious disease\u201d, and \u201cresponse to vaccine\u201d, respectively (Fig. 1\n). In terms of unique variant-trait associations, percentages were as follows: 2.5% for \u201cinfectious disease\u201d, 0.18% for \u201cresponse to treatment for infectious disease\u201d, and 0.66% for \u201cresponse to vaccine\u201d (Fig. 1). Based on the relative number of studies and associations, it is clear that some traits/diseases have attracted huge efforts that provided consequent reward (e.g., inflammatory/autoimmune disorders, metabolic traits and phenotypes), whereas others have been deeply investigated with comparatively modest success (e.g., neurologic/neuropsychiatric/cognitive diseases and traits, cancers). The reasons for these differences are manifold and outside the scope of this Review, which focuses on infections and related traits. Based on the percentages given above and on the comparison with other traits, we conclude that, despite the huge burden that infections pose for human health, relatively few GWASs for infectious diseases have been performed and these have attained a moderate success. Apparently, the best performance was obtained by GWASs for response to vaccination, with 9 studies that reported 64 associations. However, most of these associations will require validation, as they derive from a relatively small-scale study with no replication (Kennedy et al., 2012).\n",

The number of variants on the SNP chips that are used for GWASs has increased sensibly since the development of this technology (from ~ 500,000 in the initial studies to > 4,000,000 in the latest platforms). Moreover, the availability of an increasing number of fully sequenced genomes, together with the development of efficient imputation methods, has definitely expanded the power of GWASs to detect association with variants in the low range of the frequency spectrum (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017)). However, the overall power of a GWAS is also critically dependent on the sample size (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017) and see below) and in most cases power remains low for variants with a frequency below 1% (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017)).",

In these countries, however, the burden imposed by infectious diseases is highest (Jones et al., 2008; Mabey et al., 2004). Also, some populations in developing areas have complex demographic histories. This is the case of African populations, that are genetically highly diverse and display a limited extension of linkage disequilibrium (LD) compared to non-Africans (International HapMap Consortium et al., 2007). For instance, one of the first GWASs for infectious diseases genotyped individuals in West Africa to identify susceptibility variants for severe malaria (Jallow et al., 2009). The authors found considerable population stratification, which was corrected for using principal components analysis (PCA); signals of association at known malaria resistance loci (e.g. HBB) were difficult to retrieve due to weak LD between causal variants (e.g., HbS locus) and tag SNPs (Jallow et al., 2009). Populations from South and Central America also display relevant population structure due to recent admixture (Bryc et al., 2010). In a GWAS for visceral Leishmaniasis that included families from Brazil, ancestry differences and close relationships were efficiently corrected for using a linear mixed model (LeishGEN Consortium et al., 2013). These models are an alternative to those based on PCA and rely on the incorporation of genetic relatedness between individuals directly in the statistical model (see (Eu-Ahsunthornwattana et al., 2014; Hayes, 2013; Yang et al., 2014) for reviews and comparison among different linear mixed model methods).",

A well-known example in the field of non-communicable diseases relates to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. Several studies for T2D indicated that the proportion of Native American genetic ancestry is associated with lower socioeconomic status in admixed Latino populations from North and South America (Chakraborty et al., 1986; Florez et al., 2009; Martinez-Marignac et al., 2007; Parra et al., 2004). This effect is partially responsible for the generally higher incidence of T2D in Latinos. This exemplifies how the combined effect of genetic admixture and environmental factors has the potential to affect genetic associations. Indeed, poor socioeconomic conditions represent a risk factor for several infectious diseases (Baker et al., 2012; Braveman, 2011; Franco-Paredes et al., 2007; May, 2007; Semenza, 2010). Thus, possible environmental confounders must be accounted for to avoid spurious associations or loss of statistical power. However, even in the presence of admixture and environmental confounders, associations can be retrieved with confidence. In a GWAS for tuberculosis (TB), Chimusa and coworkers analyzed admixed South African Coloured case-control cohorts (Chimusa et al., 2014). After accounting for population stratification and hidden relatedness, they replicated a previously reported association at the WT1 gene (Thye et al., 2012) and performed trans-ethnic fine mapping of the association signals (Table 1). The authors also found a positive correlation between San (an African ethnic group) ancestry proportion and TB status. Although complete information was available for a minority of individuals, no correlation was detected between socioeconomic status and ancestry components, leading the authors to suggest that the association between San ancestry and TB is not merely explained by differences in socioeconomic conditions (Chimusa et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Perhaps, the two most important points that characterize GWAS for infectious diseases compared to studies of non-communicable conditions are phenotypic heterogeneity and case-control misclassification. An important source of heterogeneity in GWASs for infectious diseases derives from genetic variation in the pathogen. One of the best known examples of how the genotype of the infectious agent can interact with the host genome refers to hepatitis C virus. Among the most significant findings of GWASs for infectious diseases was the identification in 2009\u20132010 of variants at the IFNL3/IFNL4 loci (previously known as IL28B) that associate with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and with response to interferon-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy (Ge et al., 2009; Rauch et al., 2010; Suppiah et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2009) (Table 1). This finding set the basis for a personalized treatment of HCV infection (Matsuura et al., 2014). However, the effect of the IFNL3/IFNL4 variants on response to therapy is much stronger for patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 than for those infected with genotypes 2, 3, and 6 (Rauch et al., 2010; Akkarathamrongsin et al., 2014). Interestingly, interferon-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy is less effective for patients infected with genotypes 1 and 4 compared to the other genotypes (European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2011). Thus, the prognostic value of the IFNL3/IFNL4 variants is particularly relevant for patients infected with HCV genotypes that are poorly responsive to this treatment (Rauch et al., 2010). These observations well exemplify how important the interaction of the host and pathogen genomes can be. Very recently, a genome-to-genome GWAS for HCV infection was performed, shedding more light into the interaction between human IFNL4/IFNL3 variants and HCV genetic diversity (Ansari et al., 2017) (see Conclusions and perspectives section).",

The human Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) consists of several major phylogenetic lineages whose names reflect their association with geographic areas (Brites and Gagneux, 2015). Candidate gene approaches have shown that host genetic variants can modulate susceptibility to TB caused by specific MTBC strains (Herb et al., 2008; Caws et al., 2008; Intemann et al., 2009; van Crevel et al., 2009; Salie et al., 2014). For instance, a variant in TLR2 was specifically associated with an increased risk of TB caused by the Beijing strain in a Vietnamese population, whereas two SLC11A1 polymorphisms were found to be significantly more common in patients having tuberculosis caused by M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype strains than in patients carrying other genotypes (Caws et al., 2008; van Crevel et al., 2009). In populations from Ghana, an IRGM polymorphism was found to protect against disease caused by the Euro-American lineage (Intemann et al., 2009), and polymorphisms in ALOX5 were more strongly associated with TB caused by M. africanum West African 2 strain (Herb et al., 2008). Furthermore, associations of specific HLA class I alleles and disease caused by the Beijing, LAM, LCC and Quebec strains, as well as by the Euro-American or East Asian lineages, were found in a South African population (Salie et al., 2014).",

Cases are also sometimes problematic to define. For instance, seropositivity can result from different routes of exposure, in turn associated with distinct probabilities of infection, and possibly modulated by diverse genetic factors. Moreover, the probability of infection may depend on several factors, including the genetic characteristics of the pathogen, the infectiousness of the transmitting individual, the general health status at the moment of exposure (this is clearly important for nosocomial infections, for instance).",

No information was available for controls on HIV-1 exposure (e.g., at risk behavior or possible parenteral exposure). The study failed to detect association with HIV infection susceptibility other than the known CCR5\u039432 variant. An association signal at the HLA-B/HLA-C genes was not confirmed after correcting for frailty (survival) bias (McLaren et al., 2013). These results led to the conclusion that genetic variants that modulate HIV-1 acquisition are either rare or have small effects. However, as the authors note, the study design has a high potential for misclassification of both cases and controls (McLaren et al., 2013). Indeed, cases may include subjects with low HIV-1 susceptibility who were infected due to very high exposure (e.g. via multiple blood transfusions), whereas controls may comprise subjects who never exposed themselves to the virus. Because studies on high-risk populations indicated that the proportion of subjects who are naturally resistant to HIV-1 is around 20% (Plummer et al., 1999; Fowke et al., 1996), it can be hypothesized that as many as 80% of controls would seroconvert if exposed. McLaren and coworkers estimated that the sample size of their GWAS provided 80% power for variants with 0.1 allele frequency and genotype relative risk (GRR) of 1.3. Their calculations also show that if ~ 30%, ~ 60%, or ~ 80% of cases were misclassified as controls, GRRs of 2, 3, or 4 would be respectively necessary to achieve the same power (McLaren et al., 2013). In fact, the authors did detect association for the CCR5\u039432 variant, indicating that polymorphisms with strong effect could be identified.",

The study confirmed most of the previously reported associations in HLA class II genes and detected a new variant, rs1883832 in CD40, strongly associated with HBV chronic infection (Table 1, Fig. 2). rs1883832 influences CD40 expression by affecting its translational efficiency (Jacobson et al., 2005). This association was confirmed, although not at genome-wide significant level, by a recent GWAS that analyzed chronically HBV-infected and spontaneously recovered subjects (Li et al., 2016). In this study, the authors also identified an intergenic variant at 8p21.3 which represents an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the INTS10 (integrator complex subunit 10) gene (Table 1). Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that INTS10 suppresses HBV replication in liver cells via IRF3, and confirmed decreased INTS10 protein levels in plasma samples of chronically HBV-infected patients compared to subjects who spontaneously cleared infection (Li et al., 2016).",

It should be noted, however, that some of these studies did not directly test HPV infection status, nor HPV type, making it difficult to determine which trait these associations refer to. An interesting observation is that polymorphisms in the EXCO1 and GSDMB genes were associated with progression to cervical carcinoma (Shi et al., 2013) (Table 1). EXOC1 encodes a subunit of the exocyst complex involved in host innate immune response against DNA antigens (Ishikawa et al., 2009), whereas GSDMB codes for the cancer-associated gasdermin-like protein, which is highly expressed in cervical cancer cells (Sun et al., 2008).

Although the study had limited power and potential for control misclassification (e.g., individuals who never suffered from primary infection with VZV are not at risk of virus reactivation), a significant association was detected in the MHC region where the non-coding HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) gene maps (Table 1). Intriguingly, variants in this region were also associated with delayed progression to AIDS (Table 1, Fig. 2). HCP5 derives from an endogenous retroviral element with sequence homology to the HIV-1 pol gene (Kulski and Dawkins, 1999) and is primarily expressed in immune system cells (Liu et al., 2008). The function of this noncoding gene and its role (if any) in restricting viral infection remain to be determined. In fact, a functional study showed that HCP5 does not restrict HIV-1 infection in vitro (Yoon et al., 2010), and refinement of the association signals within the HLA region indicated that the HCP5 variant associated with HIV-1 control is indeed a marker for the HLA-B*5701 allele (Fellay et al., 2009; Trachtenberg et al., 2009). Likewise, HCP5 variants that reached genome-wide significance in the VZV GWAS are in strong linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms in the HLA-B gene region (Crosslin et al., 2015). It is thus possible that HCP5 has no effect on viral infection per se, but its variants tag specific HLA class I alleles/haplotypes.",

All subjects were recruited in developed countries, where the majority of diarrhoeal episodes are caused by viral infections (Wiegering et al., 2011). Despite the potential issues of phenotype heterogeneity, a significant association was found for variants in FUT2, a gene encoding an alpha (1,2)-fucosyltransferase which participates in the production of histo-blood group antigens (Table 1). In particular, the activity of FUT2 determines the expression of the ABO histo-blood group antigens on the gastrointestinal mucosa and in bodily secretions. Genetic diversity at the FUT2 gene is maintained in human populations by balancing selection (Koda et al., 2001; Fumagalli et al., 2009) and common FUT2 null alleles are present in many populations (Kelly et al., 1995; Koda et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1998). In homozygotes, these alleles determine the \u201cnon-secretor\u201d phenotype. In the GWAS for diarrhoeal episodes, non-secretors were found to be at lower risk compared to secretors, a result in line with candidate-gene studies that associated the non-secretor status with protection from Rotavirus and Norovirus infections (which represent the leading causes of diarrhoeal disease in developed regions) (Wiegering et al., 2011; Lindesmith et al., 2003; Carlsson et al., 2009; Imbert-Marcille et al., 2014; Thorven et al., 2005). In line with the balancing selection scenario, however, candidate-gene studies associated the non-secretor status with higher risk for infection by different pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Candida spp. (Blackwell et al., 1986a; Blackwell et al., 1986b; Chaim et al., 1997). More recently, non-secretors were also found to be at higher risk to develop Crohn's disease (Franke et al., 2010; McGovern et al., 2010). The molecular mechanism underlying the different predisposition to infection (and to Crohn's disease) of secretors and non-secretors most likely stems from the fact that both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms exploit oligosaccharides on the gastrointestinal mucosa for cytoadherence.",

Furthermore, in a GWAS for leprosy in the Chinese population, H. Liu et al. (2015) found an overlap between their hits and those for autoimmunity/inflammatory diseases. For example, association with CCDC88B, identified in the leprosy GWAS (Table 1), was also reported for primary biliary cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Likewise, SNPs in TNFSF15, LRRK2, IL18RAP/IL1RL1, and LACC1/CCDC122 represent susceptibility loci for both leprosy and Crohn's disease (Jostins et al., 2012; J.Z. Liu et al., 2015). This observation points to a shared immunological basis for infectious and inflammatory conditions (H. Liu et al., 2015). However, the study also showed that, whereas some shared loci (RIPK2 and LACC1/CCDC122) had concordant effects on the risk for leprosy and for inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, some others (e.g., IL18RAP/IL1RL1) showed opposite or discordant risk effects. These findings suggest a complex scenario and a delicate balance between response to infection and autoimmunity/chronic inflammation (Sironi and Clerici, 2010).",

            "text": "As expected, genes of the adaptive immune system also turned out to harbor polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to infections. Variants in the MHC region were identified as risk factors for leprosy (Zhang et al., 2009; H. Liu et al., 2015), Staphylococcus aureus infection (DeLorenze et al., 2016), enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi (Dunstan et al., 2014), and TB (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016) (Table 1, Fig. 2). For this latter infection, several GWASs have been performed (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The WT1 association mentioned above was detected in two independent studies (Chimusa et al., 2014; Thye et al., 2012) and recently confirmed, although with a p value that did not reach genome-wide significance, in a family-based Moroccan discovery sample (Grant et al., 2016). The functional role played by WT1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in TB susceptibility remains to be elucidated. An interesting possibility is that WT1 regulates cytokine expression or activation of the vitamin D receptor (Maurer et al., 2001). Instead, the role played by ASAP1, a gene associated to TB in a Russian discovery cohort and replicated in African populations (Table 1), is somehow clearer, as its protein product regulates dendritic cell migration (Curtis et al., 2015). However, the signals in these genes showed very small effects (WT1) or failed to replicate (ASAP1) in a recent large TB study in the Icelandic population (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016). This GWAS is a nice example of the power of imputation to enormously extend the number of analyzed variants. In fact, the authors used whole-genome sequencing of 2636 Icelanders to impute 28.3 million SNPs and insertions/deletions for > 100,000 chip-typed individuals. These included subjects with pulmonary TB or infected with M. tuberculosis. This large-scale study detected association signals at MHC class II loci, which were validated in Russian and Croatian samples (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016). As discussed above, the low reproducibility of associations across studies and populations may in part reflect local differences in circulating M. tuberculosis strains (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016). Finally, we mention that variants nearby the IL12B gene, which encodes a subunit of interleukin 12, were recently associated to TB in African populations (from Tanzania and Uganda) (Sobota et al., 2016). In this GWAS, the authors used an interesting approach by including in the study only HIV-1 positive individuals. The underlying rationale was that HIV-positive individuals who do not develop TB despite living in endemic areas should be genetically resistant and ideally suited to detect variants with strong effect. Indeed, the identified variant has a strong protective effect and may modulate IL12B expression (Sobota et al., 2016). Although this signal has not been replicated yet, it is worth mentioning that loss-of-function mutations in IL12B cause mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease, a rare condition characterized by the development of clinical symptoms following infection with weakly virulent mycobacteria (Picard et al., 2002).",

Interestingly, the risk allele is relatively rare and restricted to populations of African ancestry, underscoring the relevance of population-specific variants in disease susceptibility. Assessing AC011288.2 RNA expression in leukocyte cell subsets, Rautanen and coworkers observed expression in neutrophils only. These cells are known to play a major role in pneumococcal clearance (Gingles et al., 2001; Brinkmann et al., 2004) and their count is an independent predictor of pneumococcal bacteremia in febrile children (Kuppermann et al., 1998).",

In 2013, using inter-crosses of mouse strains, Gomez and coworkers provided the first direct demonstration that a lncRNA (termed NeST) can modulate the outcome of infection (Gomez et al., 2013). In particular, NeST was shown to be responsible for the persistence of Theiler's virus in the central nervous system, as well as for the clearance of Salmonella infection (Gomez et al., 2013).

For many parasitic diseases a heritable component has been demonstrated (Verra et al., 2009; Williams-Blangero et al., 2011; Dold and Holland, 2011; Choi et al., 2003). However very few GWAS were conducted; their results are summarized in Table 1 and were reviewed elsewhere (Mangano and Modiano, 2014). We add herein that a recent GWAS explored the genetic susceptibility to malaria (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network et al., 2015). Beyond confirming loci previously associated with severe malaria (HBB, ABO, ATP2B4) (Jallow et al., 2009; Timmann et al., 2012; Band et al., 2013), this study identified additional variants on chromosome 4, between FREM3 and a cluster of three glycophorin genes (GYPE, GYPB, and GYPA) (Table 1). Glycophorins are sialoglycoproteins abundantly expressed on the erythrocyte membrane, where they play a functional role in invasion by Plasmodium falciparum. In a recent follow-up study, the authors identified an array of large copy number variants (CNVs) affecting the GYPA and GYPB genes (Leffler et al., 2017). One of the identified CNVs (DUP4) is associated with resistance to severe malaria and explains the GWAS association signal (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network et al., 2015).",

Variants in PRPN, encoding the prion protein (PrP), are the best known genetic factor for susceptibility to CJD (Owen et al., 1990; Mead et al., 2009) (Table 1). Nevertheless, associations to other genomic loci (MTMR7 and NPAS2 for variant CJD (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2012), GRM8 for sporadic CJD (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2015)) were recently reported (Table 1). MTMR7 is specifically expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol pathway, whereas NPAS2 encodes a transcription factor implicated in neuronal function. Interestingly, the CJD susceptibility variant in NPAS2 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with an SNP that regulates PLCD3 in trans (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2012). Because PLCD3 encodes a catabolic enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol pathway, these data implicate this pathway in the susceptibility to variant CJD. As for GRM8, it encodes a member of the metabotropic glutamate receptor family. Other members of this family are involved in cellular signal transduction triggered by PrP (Um et al., 2013). Thus, these data highlight the ability of GWASs to pinpoint molecular disease pathways.",

            "text": "In the field of mouse genetics, an important contribution to the mapping of complex traits came from the Collaborative Cross (CC), a collaborative effort aimed at providing the scientific community with a large panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from genetically diverse founders (Churchill et al., 2004; Maurizio and Ferris, 2017). As founders are both classic inbred strains and wild-derived strains, the resulting mouse panel has higher genetic diversity and less population structure than other mouse-based resources. Within the CC framework, an ancestry-based approach was shown to be superior to marker-based methods for mapping QTLs (Aylor et al., 2011). The utility of this approach in the field of infectious diseases was initially demonstrated by a genome-wide scan of incipient CC lines for susceptibility to Aspergillus fumigatus, a pathogen that recapitulates in mice the signs of human aspergillosis (Durrant et al., 2011). The authors found that CC lines were heterogenous in terms of susceptibility to A. fumigatus infection, measured as survival days after infection, and the broad-sense heritability of this phenotype was 0.78. The genome-wide scan identified several QTLs, including one on chromosome 8 that contained the Irf2 gene and another one on chromosome 10 covering cytokine (Il20ra, Il22ra) and interferon (Ifngr1) receptors (Durrant et al., 2011). Incipient CC lines were then used to investigate the genetic susceptibility to IAV infection by recording several IAV-induced phenotypes, including virus replication, airway inflammation, weight loss, and pulmonary edema. Interestingly, a highly significant QTL on chromosome 16 (HrI1, Host response to Influenza), was identified (Ferris et al., 2013). HrI1 explained a considerable proportion of variation in several phenotypes and encompassed a genomic region where the Mx1 gene maps. Because Mx1 is a well-known IAV resistance gene (Staeheli et al., 1988), these findings provide a nice validation of the CC approach. Additional QTLs were mapped in the study and suggested that variants in Il16 and/or Nox4 (HrI2) modulate IAV-induced weight loss (Ferris et al., 2013).",

Dog breeds represent genetic isolates deriving from a few founder individuals and subject to strong artificial selection. Thus, breeds differ in several phenotypes. One of these is granulomatous colitis, which is caused by mucosally invasive Escherichia coli (Simpson et al., 2006) and is described in boxers and bulldogs only (Craven et al., 2011; Manchester et al., 2013). Within a larger project that assessed several traits and diseases, Hayward and coworkers performed a within-breed GWAS for granulomatous colitis and identified a strong association signal within a genomic region where several members of the SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule) gene family map (Hayward et al., 2016). Interestingly, variants in the corresponding human genomic region have been associated with the susceptibility to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Franke et al., 2010; J.Z. Liu et al., 2015; Barrett et al., 2008). These data indicate that, both in dogs and in humans, genes within this region contribute to the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis in the presence of commensal or pathogenic bacteria.",

Several GWASs have been performed, mostly on naturally infected Holsteins and Jerseys (common breeds of dairy cattle): associated variants with small effect were identified in several analyses, but reproducibility among studies was extremely low, resulting in no confidently associated marker (Alpay et al., 2014; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Minozzi et al., 2010; Neibergs et al., 2010; Pant et al., 2010; Settles et al., 2009; van Hulzen et al., 2012; Zare et al., 2014). Although the reasons for low across-study consistency are likely manifold and include different criteria to classify phenotypes and different statistical procedures, these results suggest that loci with a major effect on Johne's disease do not exist, at least in these breeds. Likewise, GWASs for susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) yielded inconsistent results (Bermingham et al., 2014; Finlay et al., 2012; Kassahun et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2016). Efforts to identify susceptibility alleles for other infectious diseases detected small-effect loci with poor replicability (reviewed in (Raszek et al., 2016)). To date, the greatest success was obtained for mastitis, which is commonly caused by bacterial infections; regions spanning the DCK, SLC4A4, and EDN3 genes were detected in at least two studies (Kanazawa et al., 1989; Sahana et al., 2013; Sodeland et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2015). The functional role of these genes in mastitis and response to invading bacteria remains to be evaluated.",

Several GWASs for PRRSV susceptibility converged to identify a major locus on chromosome 4 (reviewed in (Dekkers et al., 2017)). Fine mapping of the QTL region and a further functional genomics work identified a variant in the GBP5 gene as likely causal (Dekkers et al., 2017). GPB5 encodes an interferon-inducible guanosine triphosphatase which plays central roles in cell-intrinsic immunity. In humans, GBP5 acts as a restriction factor for HIV (Krapp et al., 2016). For the purpose of swine breeding, this result is relevant as a variation at GBP5 can be used for marker-assisted selection (Dekkers et al., 2017).",

For instance, hundreds of millions of people are infected by helminths (Hotez et al., 2008), but no GWAS has investigated the genetic susceptibility to these parasites even though linkage studies provided evidence for several QTLs (reviewed in (Mangano and Modiano, 2014)).

However, next-generation approaches require sample sizes even larger than GWASs (Auer et al., 2016; Zuk et al., 2014) and the amount of phenotypic variance that is explained by rare penetrant variants may largely differ among traits. We consider that important knowledge on infectious disease susceptibility (and related traits) can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach.",

            "text": "A promising strategy for future GWASs will be to leverage information from the host's and pathogen's genomes. An interesting step forward in this direction came from a study that generated human genome-wide genotyping data of antiretroviral naive patients and almost complete HIV-1 genome sequences to systematically search for associations between host and virus variants (genome-to-genome scan) (Bartha et al., 2013). The authors found strong associations between SNPs that tag HLA class I alleles and viral mutations in CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) epitopes. These results clearly highlight the selective pressure imposed by the host immune system on the viral genome. No signals were detected outside the HLA class I loci and, on the viral genome, most selected sites were located in Gag and Nef. However, the majority of host-associated HIV-1 mutations were found to have no or little effect on viral load, suggesting that the virus can compensate for selective pressure with little fitness cost (Bartha et al., 2013). More recently, Ansari et al. (2017) performed a genome-to-genome scans in patients chronically infected with HCV. As in the HIV-1 study, the authors found that the adaptive immune system exerts a selective pressure on the viral genome and drives the evolution of several positions across the HCV genome. Importantly, Ansari and coworkers also showed that the host genotype for a functional IFNL4 variant modulates viral load only when the individuals are infected by a virus that carries a specific amino acid residue (serine) at position 2414 in the NS5A protein. This result clearly indicates that the host and viral genomes interact to determine the control of infection (Ansari et al., 2017). The majority of patients recruited in the study were infected with genotype 3 and HCV is genetically heterogeneous, suggesting that other and possibly different interactions exist in patients infected by distinct HCV genotypes.",

            "text": "The functional polymorphism in IFNL4 is a dinucleotide variant (ss469415590, TT/\u0394G) and the effect of the \u201cfavorable\u201d TT allele is recessive (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). This finding highlights the possible relevance of non-additive models in genetic associations. In particular, overodominant models may be particularly worth exploring in the field of infectious diseases. Remarkable examples of heterozygote advantage include those described for HBB and G6PD in relation to malaria. Heterozygosity at HLA genes has also been shown to protect against different infections (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016)), and the same is true for a common variant in TIRAP, with heterozygotes protected from malaria, invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremia, and TB (Khor et al., 2007). Heterozygosity for a common polymorphism in PRNP also confers relative resistance to prion diseases (Mead et al., 2003). Overdominance causes multiple alleles to be maintained at a locus via balancing selection (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016)). A well-known example of this phenomenon is described above for the FUT2 gene. The maintenance of multiple ABO histo-blood groups, which most likely resulted from the selective pressure exerted by different pathogens, is also due to balancing selection (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016)). Several works have indicated that targets of balancing selection in primate genomes have often evolved in response to pathogen-driven selective pressures (Leffler et al., 2013; Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2008; Azevedo et al., 2015; Fumagalli and Sironi, 2014), making overdominance an appealing model to test for resistance against infection. It should however be noted that the action of balancing selection does not necessarily imply that heterozygotes are protected against a specific diseases. Epitomal in this respect is the case of FUT2 described above, as well as that of ABO: individuals with O histo-blood group are protected against severe malaria and cerebral malaria, but at higher risk of developing highly symptomatic cholera infection (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Cooling, 2015). Interestingly, large-scale studies that focused on specific variants involved in resistance to malaria (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Clarke et al., 2017) indicated that G6PD deficiency also results in different susceptibility phenotypes. Thus, the level of G6PD activity is associated with decreased risk of cerebral malaria, but with increased risk of severe malarial anaemia (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Clarke et al., 2017). Moreover, by using a Bayesian statistical framework that allows for heterogeneity of effects across populations and phenotypes, the authors showed that homozygotes for the derived allele of a variant in the 5\u2032 upstream region of CD40LG have significantly reduced risk of severe malaria in The Gambia, but significantly increased risk in Kenya (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014). Finally, a significant epistatic interaction was noted between the HbC variant and an SNP in ATP2B4, this latter encoding a major erythrocyte calcium channel (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014). Overall, these results indicate that models of genetic resistance/susceptibility are often complex and that statistical methods that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes may improve the power and reliability of GWASs.",

            "text": "For infectious diseases, a particular role may be played by interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex. One example of this latter scenario relates to polymorphic variants in HLA-C and in the MIR148A gene (for microRNA-148a, mir-148a). Kulkarni et al. (2011) identified a polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-C which affects a miR-148a binding site and associates with HLA-C expression levels, as well as with HIV-1 control. More recently, the same authors showed that an insertion/deletion polymorphism flanking MIR148A modulates the expression of this microRNA and the level of HIV-1 control only in individuals carrying HLA-C alleles with an intact miR-148a binding site. The MIR148A variant has no effect on HIV-1 control among subjects who carry HLA-C alleles that do not bind miR-148A (Kulkarni et al., 2013). Situations similar to the one described by Kulkarni and coworkers may be common and may be particularly important for HLA class I and KIR loci, as they biologically interact as binding partners. For instance, epistatic interactions among specific KIR and HLA loci have been shown to modulate the progression to AIDS (Hancock et al., 2008; Gaudieri et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2007), as well as the spontaneous (Thons et al., 2017; Khakoo et al., 2004) and therapy-induced clearance of HCV infection (Ahlenstiel et al., 2008). Likewise, interactions within the MHC may be common and relevant in modulating infection-related phenotypes. Indeed, it was recently shown that non-additive and interaction effects within HLA loci are widespread and modulate the risk of different autoimmune diseases (Lenz et al., 2015).",

All other populations remained severely underrepresented. This trend is somehow attenuated in the studies we reviewed herein, as populations of Asian origin were included in > 33% of studies (most of them on HBV, HCV, and mycobacterial infections), whereas 14% and 17% of GWASs analyzed at least one cohort of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry, respectively. However, only two studies, both of them on prion diseases, included Pacific Islanders (from Papua New Guinea) and no GWAS recruited Australian aborigines or other native peoples. These percentages clearly highlight the need to extend GWASs analysis for infectious diseases to under-represented populations. This is required to ensure that the benefits of research are equally distributed, especially in light of the recent evidence of limited portability of GWAS results across populations (Martin et al., 2017).",
