This change in how vascular surgery departments are adapting to 10 the ongoing scenario reveals a clear trend toward providing urgent care, as previously suggested 11 by some vascular communities 2 . Additionally, along that line, an \"endovascular first-line 12 approach\" seems reasonable because less in-hospital resources are required. 13 14 Spain has been especially affected, with nearly 15,000 deaths and 150,0000 positive cases. 15",

Some reports describe 22 acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias and/or myocarditis due to the systemic inflammatory 23 3 response as well as localized vascular inflammation 3 . 1 2 Although substantial attention is directed toward evaluating the relationship between COVID-19 3 and myocardial disease 4,5 , we should not forget the global picture of the CV pathology and its 4 potential inducement of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). 5 6 Table I and II summarize four cases presenting with acute critical limb ischemia (ACLI) in 7 patients testing COVID-19 (+) with no previous vascular consultations or symptoms. We 8 identified a delayed diagnosis for the entire group. Either the patients were extremely fearful 9 about coming to the hospital or were underdiagnosed during hospitalization, as confirmed with 10 written commentary from nurses. An arterial thrombotic event presented in two COVID-19 11 patients who were asymptomatic despite testing positive for the disease. Blood testing 12 demonstrated a high inflammatory response in all of these patients (D-dimer, CRP) that was 13 significantly higher in those who were hospitalized with active and severe pneumonia. 14 Interestingly, pro-calcitonin values were normal in all of these patients, indicating an evolving 15 inflammatory condition. Although no strong conclusions can be drawn from this initial 16 description, it may serve as guidance for future studies seeking to improve PAD identification. 17 18 Clinicians involved in PAD care understand that timing is a key factor in limb salvage and ACLI 19 patient survival. These delayed presentations clearly demonstrate a population that is in fear of 20 presenting to an overwhelmed health system. The underdiagnoses in hospitalized patients could 21 be related to incomplete physical examinations in poorly communicating isolated elderly patients 22",
