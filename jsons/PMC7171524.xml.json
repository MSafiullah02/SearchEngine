In different cities across the country 15 (ICT-01, Balochistan-01, KP-01, Punjab-04, Sindh-05, AJK-01, GB-01 and NIH mobile testing lab deployed in Taftan) laboratories have been equipped with free PCR system facilities for COVID-19 test. Pakistan's testing capacity has been increased from 30,000 to 280,000 and would be further enhanced to 900,000. Since the outbreak the country has carried out nearly 15,000 coronavirus tests. In order to improve the testing efficiency, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) works with National Institute of Health (NIH) to rise the current number of coronavirus testing laboratories from 15 to 50. The new testing labs would be set in different cities across the country. Pakistan is also launching a training program for paramedics and laboratory staff to resolve the deficiency. NDMA would recruit 100 lab technicians with expertise in molecular biology [22].",

The current scenario of Pakistan is not satisfactory as Pakistan is much populated country where required more facilitation. Pakistan is a developing country where the financial position is not better as compared to China, USA, UK, Russia to combat with COVID-19 outbreak. The number of hospitals and quarantine facilities being not fulfilled as required. If these medical facilities improved, then it will not be difficult to control the transmission of viruses and treatment of patients. Currently the testing facilities are much lower than the required target. The testing facilities could increase by five to ten (5to 10) folds. The right steps should be taken to control the situation more worst such as staying at homes, lockdown, social distancing, using sanitizers, face mask when necessary. Pakistan needs more screening facilities for the arrivals as well as for the departures. It is hoped that Pakistan will overtake the COVID-19.",
