The substrate of renin was found to be angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced by the liver.3 Also at this time, the role of Ang II in the regulation of aldosterone production by the adrenal cortex emerged.4",

Ang II was considered the most important RAAS mediator, with increased levels of Ang II being associated with vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Ang II binds to the type-1 Ang II receptor (AT1) in a variety of tissues, including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal grand, to mediate many mechanisms that lead to raised blood pressure. The stimulation of aldosterone production via the AT1 receptor in the adrenal gland facilitates sodium retention by the kidney when aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor.",

Part of this effect occurs via direct mediation by Ang II, which activates sodium transporters in the proximal tubules of the kidney.7,8,9 Furthermore, Ang II, through binding to the AT1 receptors, is the most potent regulator of aldosterone secretion in the adrenal cortex.10,11 Aldosterone binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor induces non-genomic (rapid) and genomic effects in many tissues, but mainly in the kidney, where it increases the epithelial expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC, also known as amiloride-sensitive sodium channel) at the level of the distal tubules, which favours the retention of sodium and water.12",

Even though the main mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors is to limit the formation of Ang II, other activities, such as reducing the catabolism of other vasodilator oligopeptides (such as bradykinin) by ACE, might have a role in the pharmacological effects of ACE inhibitors. Another tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysil-proline (Ac-SDKP), whose levels are elevated in patients receiving ACE inhibitors, could also be responsible for many of the antifibrotic and immune-beneficial effects of these agents.42 Furthermore, ACE inhibitors increase the levels of Ang I, which shifts RAAS activity to the axis producing Ang 1-7.43,44 Some of the favourable pharmacological effects of ACE inhibitors might be mediated though increased activity of the ACE2\u2013Ang 1-7\u2013MAS1 axis.19,20",

Since then, the systemic effects of aldosterone in hypertension, heart failure and target-organ damage became better known. Randomized clinical trials confirmed the effectiveness of spironolactone to treat hypertension and showed that the drug has antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties.48 Spironolactone binds to other receptors in addition to the mineralocorticoid receptor, such as androgen and progesterone receptors, which can have adverse effects such as gynaecomastia and decreased libido. In 2002, a second mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone, was introduced. Eplerenone has less affinity for sex hormone receptors than spironolactone; the drug has a nearly similar antihypertensive effectiveness to that of spironolactone, yet is less potent and has fewer adverse effects.60,61 A third antagonist, canrenone, is available in some countries but scant clinical data on this drug exist.62 In addition to their use in primary hyperaldosteronism, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers are commonly used to treat ascites,63 heart failure64 and resistant hypertension.65,66",

Neprilysin inhibition increases the plasma levels of natriuretic peptides, but has modest effects in reducing blood pressure.71 However, combining neprilysin with a RAAS blocker is a powerful tool to increase natriuresis and vasodilation. The first therapeutic agent in this class was omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase that inhibits both neprilysin and ACE. The cardiovascular effects of omapatrilat were encouraging, but a high rate of angioedema stopped clinical trials of this drug.72 The next generation of drugs in this group combines a natriuretic peptide inhibitor with an ARB. LCZ696, the first agent of the angiotensin-receptor\u2013neprilysin (ARN) inhibitor class, combines a neprilysin inhibitor moiety with a valsartan moiety. This dual therapy decreases blood pressure in animals and healthy humans with low rates of adverse effects.73 This type of drug intervention is promising in the fields of hypertension and heart failure.",

In approximately 50 patients per arm, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was utilized. Mean diastolic 24 h blood pressure was not different between the groups receiving the two therapies, but mean systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the LCZ696 group because of larger nocturnal decreases in blood pressure than those observed in the valsartan or placebo groups. The greater blood pressure reduction seen in patients receiving LCZ696 when compared with patients in the other groups was not related to increased levels of the second messenger (cGMP) that mediates the actions of natriuretic peptides.",

Finerenone, previously called BAY 94-8862,81 is a potent and promising mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that conferred extensive cardiovascular and renal protection in rat models of hypertension and heart failure when compared with eplerenone.82 The ARTS trial assessed the efficacy and safety of this drug in patients with systolic heart failure and mild CKD.83 This phase II study consisted of two parts. Part A, which involved 65 patients, evaluated the safety and tolerability of 2.5, 5 or 10 mg daily doses of finerenone versus placebo. Part B assessed the safety and efficacy of the drug in 392 patients randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 design to receive finerenone orally at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg daily, or 5 mg twice daily; placebo; or open-label oral spironolactone, which was given at an initial dose of 25 mg daily and uptitrated to 50 mg daily if serum potassium concentrations allowed. Finerenone decreased the levels of BNP and N-terminal proBNP. The drug decreased albuminuria by a similar degree to spironolactone and was associated with lower incidence of hyperkalaemia and acute renal failure. More data are needed to assess the clinical effects of finerenone. The ARTS HF trial, which has been completed but has not been published yet, assessed the efficacy and safety of this drug when compared with eplerenone in patients with diabetes mellitus but without CKD or chronic left-ventricular dysfunction.84",

An additional potential benefit of this approach is the prevention of a reactive increase in aldosterone levels, which occurs when the receptor is blocked. The potential downside of this strategy is that aldosterone synthase inhibitors might also suppress cortisol release by inhibiting cytochrome P450 11B1, mitochondrial (also known as steroid 11\u03b2-hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP11B1 gene), because the two enzymes have a high sequence homology.",

In phase I studies, a 0.5 mg daily dose of LCI699 was well tolerated and lowered plasma and urinary aldosterone levels without affecting cortisol secretion.94 At higher doses, however, cortisol secretion was diminished. Phase II studies demonstrated that plasma and urinary aldosterone levels are decreased with LCI699 therapy, but the RAAS is upregulated and slight hyponatraemia and increased serum potassium levels were reported.95 In a large study, 524 patients were randomized to receive either LCI699 0.25 mg once daily (n = 92), 0.5 mg once daily (n = 88), 0.5 mg twice daily (n = 97) or 1.0 mg once daily (n = 86); eplerenone 50 mg twice daily (n = 84); or placebo (n = 77) for 8 weeks.96 LCI699 intake was associated with a modest reduction in blood pressure that was lower than that achieved with eplerenone.When aldosterone synthase is inhibited by LCI699, cortisol levels remain normal, but 11-deoxycorticosterone levels increase, which means that the adrenocorticotropic-hormone\u2013cortisol axis is stimulated by the inhibition of expression of the CYP11B1 gene.97 The stimulation of this axis might be one of the reasons why the decrease in blood pressure is only modest even at high LCI699 doses.",

However, aliskiren is the only DRI available. As add-on therapy to ARBs, aliskiren did not improve renal or cardiovascular outcomes and was associated with more adverse effects than ARB therapy alone.58 Aliskiren has not been evaluated as initial or solo therapy, because other drugs have proven benefits when administered in this way. In the USA, the package insert of aliskiren contains a formal recommendation by the FDA that the drug should not be used as dual therapy in association with ARBs or ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes mellitus and renal disease. In 2013, a new DRI, ACT-077825, was shown to have an adequate safety profile in humans when administered once daily.103 ACT-077825 inhibits plasma renin activity, while the levels of immunoreactive renin increase, a pattern typical of DRIs.102 However, the decrease in plasma renin activity is transient and is not dose-dependent at 7 days.103 The mechanism underlying these observations is not clear, because the plasma levels of ACT-077825 remain constant.103 The effects of this DRI on blood pressure are controversial, as only one study showed a decrease in blood pressure when ACT-077825 was used, and this effect was seen in the supine position,104 whereas other studies showed no differences between the effects of ACT-077825 and placebo on blood pressure in healthy individuals and patients with hypertension.103,105 More studies are necessary to clarify this inconsistency.",

In rats with spontaneous hypertension, the drug reduces the amount of collagen in the extracellular matrix and in vascular tissue in a blood-pressure-independent manner.107 Compound 21 has a similar effect in animal models of myocardial infarction, reducing scar formation and improving cardiac function.108 Compound 21 reduced proteinuria in the kidney of rat models of hypertension and kidney disease, and also decreased the levels of inflammatory markers in these models.109,110 In the central nervous system, AT2 receptor activation has neuroprotective effects and induces neuroregeneration. Compound 21 reproduces these effects, but has to be administered centrally to bypass the blood\u2013brain barrier.111 However, systemic administration of Compound 21 might still have effects on neuroregeneration.112 Compound 21 does not have a net effect on blood pressure, which is similar to the situation seen with other AT2 agonists.24 However, when the effects of the AT1 receptor on vasoconstriction are blocked, the vasodilator properties of Compound 21 are revealed, and blood pressure decreases.8,9 An AT2 antagonist can reverse this effect. A study published in 2014 demonstrated that the increased urinary sodium excretion that is induced by Compound 21 is mainly due to effects on proximal tubular cells of the kidney, namely internalization of sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE-3) and Na+/K+ ATPase.113 Continuous Compound 21 infusion recruited more AT2 receptors to the proximal tubule brush border than an acute infusion. Acute Compound 21 infusion did not change blood pressure, but in a 7-day experiment in which concomitant intrarenal Ang II infusion was administered, Compound 21 blocked the blood pressure effects of Ang II, increasing natriuresis.",

            "text": "The benefits of ACE2 in vascular disease might be brought about by two different mechanisms. First, by participating in Ang II degradation, ACE2 decreases the interaction of Ang II with AT1 receptors, and second, by increasing Ang 1-7 synthesis, ACE2 induces vasodilation. The main function of ACE2 has been proposed to be the counterbalancing of the effects of the ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1\u2013aldosterone axis.114 Decreases in ACE2 levels or increases in ACE and Ang II levels induced damage in animal models of diabetic nephropathy or hypertension.115,116 In animal models, the human recombinant form of ACE2 (rhACE2) reduced progression of diabetic nephropathy, decreased blood pressure (in models of hypertension), and decreased cardiac fibrosis.117,118 In 2013, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of rhACE2 were described in healthy humans.119 Daily rhACE2 intake decreased the levels of Ang II in a dose-dependent manner over 24 h, with a transient increase in Ang 1-7 levels, and more sustained increases in Ang 1-7 degradation products, such as Ang 1-5. The authors of this study suggest that rhACE2 is likely to reach the extravascular space, a hypothesis that is based on the large spread of rhACE2 distribution they observed. This enzyme has a good safety profile and did not induce immunogenicity, even when repeated doses were administered. Similarly to results reported in healthy animals, rhACE2 did not affect blood pressure or heart rate in humans. Thus, rhACE2 is a promising drug for treatment of patients with intolerance to other drugs that target RAAS components, and also perhaps in acute illnesses, such as myocardial infarction or decompensated heart failure, in which the balance between ACE and ACE2 is disturbed. This drug is attractive in the renal field, because rhACE2 might quickly reduce proteinuria, even in association with an ACE inhibitor. These two classes of drugs used together might have important protective effects mediated through substantial increases in Ang 1-7 levels. We look forward to more human clinical trials in this area. Aside from cardiovascular effects, some evidence exists that ACE2 might facilitate recovery from acute lung injury, as rhACE2 has been reported to ameliorate virus-mediated lung injury in mouse models.120 Thus, rhACE2 therapy in virus-mediated lung injury, especially influenza, in which Ang II levels are correlated with the degree of lung injury and with mortality,121 is potentially promising.",

Many attempts were made to generate vaccines against renin, Ang I, Ang II and AT1.135 However, most of these attempts have been harmful or have not had clinical efficacy. An RCT in which an anti-Ang II vaccine (CYT006-AngQb) was tested passed phase IIa without safety problems, and showed a promising 24 h reduction in blood pressure of 9.0 mmHg (systolic) and 4.0 mmHg (diastolic).136 However, subsequent studies could not confirm these results. Novel strategies are currently in development, such as the association of Ang II as an epitope to a hepatitis A virus-like particle to generate an improved immune response.137 Future studies are needed to explore the efficacy and safety of an immunological, chronic and irreversible blockade of the RAAS.",

A role for RAAS blockade in other, non-cardiovascular pathologies (such as lung injury and cognitive disorders) is emerging. The combination of RAAS inhibition with other autacoid systems (endothelin blockade or natriuretic peptide stimulation) could improve the efficacy of traditional RAAS blockade and be the basis of specific tissue-targeted drug development.",

Circulating renin can also bind to the renin receptor, which increases its enzymatic activity. Renin converts angiotensinogen to Ang I, which can then enter three main pathways. These three axes, ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1\u2013aldosterone, ACE2\u2013Ang 1-7\u2013MAS1 and Ang IV\u2013IRAP, are highlighted. Activation of the AT1 receptor in the adrenal gland results in production of aldosterone, which can then bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor.
