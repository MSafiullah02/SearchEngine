CHIKV is an arthritogenic alphavirus that is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and causes a debilitating illness known as chikungunya fever. Since its isolation in the present-day Tanzania in 1952/1953 (1), sporadic CHIKV outbreaks were reported throughout the African and Asian continents (2, 3). In 2004, the virus reemerged in Kenya and then spread eastward in the form of strains belonging to the East/Central/South African lineage that were better adapted to replication in Aedes albopictus due to an A226V substitution in the E1 protein. This resulted in large outbreaks in the South West Indian ocean islands in early 2005, in India in 2005/2006, and in Asia in the following years (4, 5). A small CHIKV outbreak in the Caribbean at the end of 2013 marked its arrival in the Americas, from which over 1.5 million infections have been reported since 2014. Following its introduction in Italy (2007 and 2017) and France (2010 and 2017) on several occasions via infected travelers, CHIKV has caused limited locally transmitted outbreaks in Europe (6\u20139). The geographical expansion of the Aedes albopictus vector and increased human travel pose the risk that CHIKV may become endemic in new territories.",

Despite its widespread emergence and high morbidity, antiviral medication is not available and the current treatment consists of administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to alleviate pain. Over the past years, there have been efforts to develop both direct-acting and host-targeting small-molecule inhibitors into antiviral drugs to treat CHIKV infection (11). Several potent CHIKV inhibitors that interfere with the functions of individual viral nonstructural proteins or the polymerase complex have been reported, including ribavirin, 6-azauridine, mycophenolic acid, and favipiravir (T-705) (12\u201314). Nevertheless, the current lack of antiviral therapy for human CHIKV infections and the generally low success rate of drug development programs underscore the need to search for compounds with improved efficacy.",

Following entry, the viral genome is translated into a nonstructural polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) to nsP4 (reviewed in reference 15). The 5\u2032 end of the viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs is modified by viral enzymes to give rise to a cap-0 (m7GpppA) structure. This cap structure is important for the alphavirus replication cycle since it protects the viral mRNAs from degradation by host 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonucleases, enables efficient translation of viral mRNAs, and plays a role in innate immune evasion. Alphavirus capping proceeds in an unconventional reaction sequence that differs from that used by the host cell, which is confined to the nucleus. In the case of the cytoplasmic alphavirus capping reaction, a GTP molecule undergoes methylation before it is transferred onto the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA, making the viral mRNA capping reaction an attractive target for antiviral drug development (16).",

A by-product and feedback inhibitor of this process is S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is subsequently hydrolyzed by the host enzyme SAH hydrolase. Inhibition of SAH hydrolase leads to accumulation of SAH, which indirectly interferes with mRNA capping (17). SAH hydrolase was first identified as a target for antiviral compounds in 1982, and since then several inhibitors of this enzyme have been reported (17, 18). These are known to possess antitumor and antimicrobial activities and have shown potent antiviral activity against a range of negative-stranded RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses, and DNA viruses; examples include pox-, paramyxo-, rhabdo-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, and reoviruses (reviewed in reference 19). Recently, we have also described SAH hydrolase inhibitors that target a broad-spectrum of (+) RNA viruses, such as some coronaviruses, Zika virus, and CHIKV (20).",

More recently, the CHVB series of compounds has been described, which displays a similar activity profile (R. Abdelnabi et al., unpublished data). Enzyme-based screening assays have also identified compounds that target nsP1, such as lobaric acid, a natural compound that was a hit in a CHIKV nsP1 GTP displacement assay-based screen (26). In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based screening campaign of more than 1,200 compounds using VEEV nsP1 has led to the identification of at least 18 potential nsP1 inhibitors (27). Recently, a similar assay with CHIKV nsP1 has been used to screen for CHIKV nsP1 inhibitors (28). Targeting the alphavirus capping pathway thus provides a new avenue for developing specific inhibitors of this sensitive point in the alphavirus replication cycle.",

By selection of escape mutants and reverse engineering we identified CHIKV nsP1 as the viral target for these compounds. Biochemical assays monitoring the formation of the 32P-labeled m7GMP-nsP1 covalent intermediate indicated that nsP1 was directly inhibited by the compounds. More specifically, an oxidized form of FHNA directly inhibited the MTase activity (but not the GTase activity) of purified SFV nsP1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mode of action of FHA and FHNA is based on a direct inhibitory effect on nsP1 rather than inhibition of host SAH hydrolase.",

The greatest reduction in the release of CHIKV infectious progeny occurred when the cells were pretreated, but inhibition of replication could be observed until 8 hpi (Fig. 2A). For SFV, treatment with FHNA led to a significant reduction in infectious progeny release upon pretreatment and when treatment was started before 1 hpi. When the start of treatment was postponed until 2 hpi or later, only negligible effects on SFV progeny titers were observed compared to untreated controls (Fig. 2B). In summary, maximal impairment of CHIKV and SFV replication by FHNA was observed when it was present prior to infection or during the early stages of virus replication, suggesting that uptake or metabolic conversion of the compound is slow and/or that FHNA interferes with an early step in the CHIKV and SFV replication cycle.",

CHIKV genomic and subgenomic RNA copy numbers in these samples were determined by internally controlled multiplex TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Treatment with 10 \u03bcM FHNA only had a limited effect on the copy numbers of intracellular genomic and subgenomic CHIKV RNA when cells were pretreated and hardly reduced copy numbers when the compound was added at the time of infection or later (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, also minimal changes in the extracellular CHIKV RNA copy numbers were observed upon FHNA treatment (Fig. 3B). This was in contrast to the clear reduction in infectious progeny titers (Fig. 2A), which led us to determine the CHIKV specific infectivity by calculating the ratio between genome copy number and infectious virus yield for the different treatment intervals. As evident from Fig. 3C, there was a decrease in specific infectivity when infected cells were pretreated or treated early in infection (\u221212 to 4 h). This suggests that FHNA causes a relative increase in noninfectious CHIKV particles, perhaps containing genomes unable to start an infection, e.g., because they are not capped. When 10 \u03bcM FHNA was added later during the infection (>6 h), the specific infectivity of CHIKV particles improved and gradually reached the levels of an untreated control (Fig. 3C).",

            "text": "In order to identify the viral target of the compound, we selected escape mutants by passaging CHIKV in the presence of FHNA. We used a previously described five-step resistance selection protocol (14), which can identify compound-resistant variants within a heterogeneous virus mixture exhibiting differing degrees of drug resistance. Mutations that are overrepresented within the resulting compound-resistant heterogeneous viral population are subsequently identified by sequencing. With this experimental setup, we selected CHIKV escape mutants using a 10 \u03bcM dose of the compound, which resulted in the isolation of seven variants (Fig. 4). The seven compound-resistant variants were substantially less sensitive to the antiviral effect of FHNA to various extents, with EC50 values ranging from 1.3 to 14.1 \u03bcM, compared to 0.14 \u03bcM for wild-type (wt) CHIKV (Table 2). Variant 1a showed by far the largest shift in the EC50 value (Fig. 4) and a >100-fold resistance compared to wt CHIKV (Table 2). To identify mutations that confer FHNA resistance, we determined the genotype of all seven compound-resistant variants by whole-genome sequencing, which revealed ten nonsilent mutations in the CHIKV open reading frame encoding the nonstructural polyprotein. We found four mutations in the nsP1-coding region, two mutations in the nsP2-coding region, and four mutations in the nsP3-coding region, some of which occurred in multiple of the seven variants, while others were unique to a particular variant (Table 3). No mutations were found in the CHIKV nsP4-coding region, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting that FHNA does not inhibit CHIKV by targeting viral RNA synthesis. To determine which mutation or combination of mutations was responsible for resistance, we reverse-engineered all mutations into the CHIKV-LS3 cDNA clone, either singularly or in the combinations detected in the original variants. In total, we generated 10 single recombinant CHIKV (rCHIKV) mutants, 5 double rCHIKV mutants, and 3 triple rCHIKV mutants (Fig. 5). The relative resistance levels of these rCHIKV mutants varied between 1 and 122-fold higher compared to wt CHIKV (Table 4). All single rCHIKV mutants, except rCHIKV*524R (* denotes the opal stop codon UGA at the end of the nsP3 coding region) and the nonviable rCHIKVA137V, exhibited a 2- to 9-fold increased resistance (Table 4), indicating that a single mutation in the CHIKV genome was not sufficient to reproduce the resistance phenotypes observed for the original variants. Mutant rCHIKV*524R was found to be 40-fold more resistant than wt CHIKV; however, the loss of the opal stop codon (*524R) is not specifically related to FHNA treatment, since it was also found in natural isolates and has been previously observed when CHIKV was passaged in the presence of the unrelated compound suramin (Albulescu et al., unpublished). Therefore, we chose a 40-fold increase in EC50 as a cutoff value (dashed line in Fig. 5), and for further analysis only considered mutants with resistance levels exceeding that of the wt virus by >40-fold (Fig. 5). Among these, variants with two mutations in nsP1, rCHIKVG230R+K299E and rCHIKVG230R+K299E+*524R, were the most resistant, displaying 87- and 122-fold increases in resistance, respectively, compared to wt CHIKV (Table 4, indicated in boldface). We conclude that the combination of the G230R and K299E mutations in nsP1 is sufficient and required for phenotypic resistance, while the individual mutations hardly provide any resistance (Table 4, indicated in boldface). Importantly, the FHNA-resistant rCHIKVG230R+K299E was also resistant to FHA, suggesting that both compounds have a similar mode of action. We reasoned that the higher level of resistance of rCHIKVG230R+K299E+*524R compared to rCHIKVG230R+K299E was due to the nonspecific effects of the *524R mutation.",

MPA targets IMP dehydrogenase, and 6-azauridine is an inhibitor of orotidylic acid decarboxylase, leading to depletion of intracellular GTP and UTP pools, respectively (29).

Since we were unable to obtain enzymatically active CHIKV nsP1, these assays were performed using purified wt SFV nsP1, SFV nsP1 containing either the K231R or the K300E mutation, and SFV nsP1 containing both mutations. As shown in the sequence alignment in Fig. 7A, SFV residues K231 and K300 correspond to G230 and K299 in the CHIKV nsP1 sequence. As controls, we included two previously described catalytic site mutants: SFV nsP1 H38A, which is deficient in GTase activity but has retained MTase activity, and SFV nsP1 D64A, which is devoid of both MTase and GTase activities (30). The enzymatic activity of these proteins was evaluated in an in vitro assay monitoring the formation of the covalent m7GMP-nsP1 complex, an important intermediate in the alphavirus capping reaction. This reaction uses \u03b132P-GTP and SAM as the substrates and requires both the MTase and GTase activities of nsP1. In the presence of both substrates, a radiolabeled reaction product of \u223c64 kDa (32P-m7GMP-nsP1) was indeed observed upon analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 7B). This product was not observed when SAM was not included in the reaction, confirming the specificity of the biochemical assay (Fig. 7B). Next, we compared the activities of the various nsP1 mutants and wt nsP1, by assessing the kinetics of 32P-m7GMP-nsP1 formation (Fig. 7C, right panel) in reactions with the same amount of enzyme (Fig. 7C, left panel). The formation of 32P-m7GMP-nsP1 was clearly visible when using wt SFV nsP1, as early as 10 min after the start of the reaction, and it steadily increased over time. The active site mutants SFV nsP1H38A and SFV nsP1D64A were hardly active, as only trace amounts of the 32P-m7GMP-nsP1 intermediate were detected after a 30- or 60-min reaction. Interestingly, the mutant proteins with the single K231R or K300E mutation and the double mutant combining these two mutations displayed very little activity compared to wt SFV nsP1. In fact, the signal observed for these mutants was comparable to that of the active-site mutants in this assay. The K231R and K300E mutations appear to specifically affect the MTase activity, as the GTase activity of the respective proteins was unchanged in an assay (22) with m7GTP and SAH (data not shown).",

Inhibition of this host cell enzyme in cell-based assays would increase intracellular SAH concentrations while decreasing SAM levels. In the in vitro assay, SAH clearly inhibited the enzymatic activity of wt nsP1, as the formation of the m7GMP-nsP1 reaction intermediate was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of SAH (Fig. 8A). In the presence of 1 mM SAH, a 100-fold molar excess over SAM, the reaction was fully inhibited. Importantly, normalization of the activity in the presence of different concentrations of SAH to the activity of untreated control protein revealed that both wt SFV nsP1 and SFV nsP1K231R+K300E were inhibited by SAH to a similar extent. Next, we assessed whether the mutations responsible for FHNA resistance lowered the affinity of SFV nsP1 for SAM, allowing the protein to be active in the presence of reduced SAM levels. There was a clear dose-dependent increase in the activity of wt SFV nsP1 when the SAM concentrations in the reaction were gradually increased from 1 to 10 \u03bcM (Fig. 8B). SFV nsP1K231R+K300E behaved in a similar manner and did not appear to be more active at low SAM levels (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the K231R and K300E mutations do not increase the affinity of SFV nsP1 for SAM nor do they affect its sensitivity to inhibition by SAH.",

It has been previously shown that inhibition of host SAH hydrolase by halo-neplanocin A analogues is based on a mechanism that involves the oxidation of the compound to its 3\u2032-keto form by NAD+ (32). Therefore, we investigated whether an oxidized (3\u2032-keto) form of FHNA directly inhibits SFV nsP1 activity by performing enzymatic assays under nonreducing conditions and in the presence or absence of NAD+. Omission of dithiothreitol (DTT) from the reaction is important to allow oxidation of FHNA. Interestingly, 1 mM FHNA inhibited wt SFV nsP1 by more than 40% under nonreducing conditions, i.e., in the absence of DTT. The level of inhibition increased to more than 50% when 1 mM NAD+ was added into the reaction mixture containing 1 mM compound (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the SFV nsP1 mutant protein with K231R and K300E substitutions was much less sensitive to FHNA under nonreducing conditions with about 20% reduction in signal. In the presence of NAD+, the signal further reduced by only about 6%, suggesting that the mutant was resistant to FHNA (Fig. 9B). Therefore, we concluded that an oxidized (3\u2032-keto) form of FHNA that can be formed under nonreducing conditions, enhanced by NAD+, directly inhibited SFV nsP1. We also demonstrated that the K231R and K300E mutations render the nsP1 protein less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of oxidized FHNA.",

The search for antiviral drugs to treat CHIKV infections in the clinic has so far proven unsuccessful. In the present study, we identified two carbocyclic adenosine analogues, FHA and FHNA, as inhibitors of CHIKV and SFV replication. These compounds were originally designed as substrate analogue inhibitors of the host enzyme SAH hydrolase and were shown to inhibit this enzyme in vitro with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 0.37 and 0.91 \u03bcM, respectively (31). In CPE reduction assays, FHA and FHNA strongly inhibited CHIKV with EC50 values of 0.12 and 0.18 \u03bcM, respectively. They also inhibited SFV, although less potently, with EC50 values of 3.9 and 5.2 \u03bcM, respectively. Time-of-addition assays indicated that FHNA inhibited CHIKV and SFV rather early in their replication cycle, with, in particular, pretreatment of cells resulting in a strong reduction of CHIKV and SFV infectious progeny (Fig. 2). Pretreatment with SAH hydrolase inhibitors increases intracellular concentrations of SAH, which could indirectly interfere with SAM-dependent methylation reactions such as those involved in mRNA capping (33, 34). The inhibition of the host enzyme SAH hydrolase was shown to be responsible for inhibition of influenza virus replication, which was caused by the accumulation of intracellular SAH and reduced viral mRNA capping (35). Alternatively, pretreatment with SAH hydrolase inhibitors could be necessary to allow sufficient uptake or metabolic conversion of the compounds to their active form. We observed a reduction in CHIKV-specific infectivity upon FHNA treatment (virtually unchanged genome copy numbers, but lower infectious progeny titers in the medium), suggesting a relative increase in the production of noninfectious particles. These might contain genomes that lack a functional cap structure, since this is known to be a major determinant of alphavirus infectivity (36).",

Subsequent genotyping and reverse genetics studies demonstrated that the combination of the G230R and K299E mutations in nsP1 was responsible for the specific resistance to FHA and FHNA. An additional mutation of the opal stop codon to an arginine codon (*524R) at the end of the nsP3-coding sequence further increased resistance, but this appeared to be a nonspecific effect (cell culture adaptation). In an independent study with the polyamine inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), Mounce et al. found that the G230R mutation in CHIKV nsP1 contributes to resistance to polyamine depletion (37). This might reflect the interconnectedness of pathways linked to methionine metabolism and polyamine biosynthesis (17, 38). In contrast to our finding of the nonspecific effect of the mutation, Mounce et al. reported that the *524R mutation in combination with nsP1 mutations was important for DFMO resistance.",

            "text": "Alignment of alphavirus nsP1 sequences (Fig. 7A) revealed that CHIKV and O\u2019nyong-nyong virus contain a glycine at position 230, while the corresponding position is occupied by a basic lysine residue in several other alphaviruses, including SFV. In the FHNA-resistant CHIKV variant, this residue was mutated into an arginine, another basic amino acid, which might explain why wt SFV is intrinsically less sensitive to the compound than CHIKV. At position 299/300, all aligned alphavirus nsP1 sequences except SINV contain a lysine, which was mutated to a glutamic acid in the resistant CHIKV variant. SINV already contains a glutamic acid at this position, which might explain why this virus is not sensitive to FHNA (Fig. 7A). In order to study the mode of action of FHNA in more detail and to investigate the mechanism by which the G230R and K299E mutations in CHIKV nsP1 confer drug resistance, we performed enzymatic assays with purified SFV nsP1. SFV nsP1 MTase activity (39) and GTase activity (21) were previously demonstrated using soluble fractions from Escherichia coli cells expressing nsP1. The previously described experimental conditions formed the basis for purification of enzymatically active SFV nsP1. We found that the SFV nsP1 K231R, K300E, and K231R+K300E mutants were much less active than the wt protein in an assay that measures both MTase and GTase activity using the formation of a 32P-labeled m7GMP-nsP1 as a readout. The activities of the SFV nsP1 K231R, K300E, and K231R+K300E mutants were comparable to those of the active site mutants H38A and D64A (Fig. 7C). This suggests that FHNA resistance of the K231R+K300E mutant is not simply due to higher enzymatic activity of nsP1. Furthermore, FHNA itself did not serve as a methyl donor as no reaction products were formed when SAM was substituted with FHNA (data not shown). We then explored whether the mode of action of FHNA was associated with the inhibition of the host SAH hydrolase, which leads to increased intracellular SAH levels. The enzymatic activities of purified wt SFV nsP1 and the SFV nsP1 K231R+K300E mutant were inhibited by SAH to the same extent (Fig. 8A). Moreover, both proteins exhibited a similar affinity for SAM (Fig. 8B). This is relevant for the mode of action of FHNA, since increased SAH levels in the host cell would lead to a decrease in SAM levels and interfere with SAM-dependent methylation reactions, including alphavirus nsP1-mediated mRNA capping. Our results demonstrate that FHNA resistance was not associated with increased resistance to the inhibitory effect of SAH or due to increased activity at low SAM concentrations. We then set out to investigate whether FHNA had a direct inhibitory effect on SFV nsP1, since we have also identified an FHNA analogue with a similar inhibitory activity against the host SAH hydrolase in vitro that is completely devoid of anti-CHIKV activity in cell-based assays (31). Previously, it was shown that halo-neplanocin A analogues inhibit SAH hydrolase via a mechanism that requires the NAD+ and the oxidation of the compound to a 3\u2032-keto form (32). Therefore, we investigated the effect of FHNA on the enzymatic activity of nsP1 under nonreducing conditions and in the presence of NAD+. Under these conditions, wt SFV nsP1 was clearly inhibited in the presence of 1 mM FHNA and 1 mM NAD+ by >50% (Fig. 9A), suggesting that an oxidized form of the compound, likely the 3\u2032 keto form, directly inhibits the MTase activity of nsP1. In contrast, the mutant protein containing the K231R and K300E mutations was much less affected by the same treatment, resulting in 25% reduction of the signal (Fig. 9B). Our results show that these mutations render the protein less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the oxidized compound and suggest this is the basis for FHNA resistance. Of note, the overall activity of nsP1 appeared to be lower when DTT was omitted from the reaction, since the amount of 32P-labeled m7GMP-nsP1 reaction intermediate was lower compared to the standard assay that includes 5 mM DTT.",

Based on our findings, we argue that FHNA is predominantly a direct-acting inhibitor of alphavirus mRNA capping due to the direct effect of an oxidized form of FHNA on the SFV nsP1 MTase activity, rather than an indirect effect via the inhibition of host SAH hydrolase. We are aware that we cannot directly extrapolate the findings of the in vitro studies with purified SFV nsP1 to the situation in CHIKV-infected cells.

            "text": "Alphavirus nsP1 harbors the enzymatic activities required for viral RNA capping in an N-terminal MTase-GTase domain, whereas the enzyme is also palmitoylated and associates with membranes (40, 41). In addition, it contains a membrane-binding amphipathic helix that is essential for the assembly of viral replication organelles (42). The region around position 231 of the SFV nsP1 sequence is rich in lysines and arginines, which are important for membrane binding (43). Therefore, it would also be interesting to investigate whether the FHNA-resistant nsP1 proteins, which have an additional positive charge in this region, would exhibit increased affinity for the negatively charged phospholipids found in membranes. Since it has been proposed that the membrane association of alphavirus nsP1 is required for its enzymatic activities (43, 44), the amino acid residues involved in membrane binding, such as the K231 residue in SFV, might also be important for the MTase and GTase activities. Earlier studies indicated that mutation of these basic residues (in a triple mutant of SFV nsP1 with R230A, K231A, and K232A mutations) reduced MTase activity (43). However, there are currently no alphavirus nsP1 structures available and therefore it is not yet possible to understand how our mutations map to the protein\u2019s three-dimensional structure, how they are positioned with respect to the SAM binding pocket, and how an oxidized form of FHNA could bind to nsP1. Whether SAM and SAH use the same binding pocket or bind to different sites in the proximity of the GTP binding site also remains to be elucidated. The structures of CHIKV and SFV nsP1 might show differences that could influence their sensitivity to the compound and the effect of the mutations. The elucidation of the CHIKV nsP1 crystal structure is essential to perform compound docking studies that could explain the direct inhibitory activity of FHNA.",

The next day, the lowest concentration of FHNA and the highest input of CHIKV that resulted in complete block of virus-induced CPE were determined by performing antiviral assays with 500 to 1,000 PFU of CHIKV per well and 0 to 10 \u03bcM FHNA. In the second step, four 96-well clusters containing VeroE6 cells were set up per dose (5 and 10 \u03bcM) and infected with the previously determined optimal viral input (500 PFU/well). At 4 days postinfection, supernatants were collected from the five wells with the most pronounced signs of CHIKV-induced CPE. In the third step, these supernatants (potentially) containing compound-resistant variants were purified by titration in the presence of the 10 \u03bcM inhibitory dose of the compound. After a 4-day incubation, seven supernatants from wells which produced CPE at the highest viral dilution were collected from the 96-well clusters (for some original samples, two supernatants were collected). In the fourth step, reference stocks of the seven supernatants containing FHNA-resistant variants were grown in T-25 flasks, which were harvested after 3 to 4 days, when full CPE was observed. After determination of the viral titers by plaque assay, the reference stocks were used for resistance phenotyping as described below. At the same time, the resistance genotype was determined by full-genome Sanger sequencing as described below.
