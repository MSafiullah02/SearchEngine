Such asymptomatic infection is especially noteworthy in the case of human pathogens such as henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses), coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] coronaviruses), and filoviruses (Marburg virus [MARV]), which cause severe, and often lethal, systemic disease in humans and non-human primates (Calisher et al., 2006, Smith and Wang, 2013). This stark difference between bats and primates has motivated efforts to deeply characterize the genes involved in the immune system of bats and understand the antiviral immune mechanisms used to control viral infection.",

The most thoroughly studied bat genome is that of Pteropus alecto (Zhang et al., 2013), a reservoir host of Hendra virus. Additional bat genomes have been studied to a more limited extent (Seim et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2013, Parker et al., 2013). The most notable findings from these studies involve two large classes of immune genes: natural killer (NK) cell receptors and type I interferons (IFNs). Multiple studies have reported the absence of canonical NK cell receptors in bat genomes (Shaw et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2015), although a few receptors were identified in the P. alecto transcriptome (Papenfuss et al., 2012). A few studies suggest that significant differences exist in type I IFNs between bats and humans (Zhang et al., 2017, Zhou et al., 2016, Kepler et al., 2010, De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018), although the precise nature of the differences remains unclear. For example, the type I IFN locus has contracted in Pteropus alecto (Zhou et al., 2016), but expanded in Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus (Kepler et al., 2010).",

These sequencing strategies impact the overall contiguity of genome assemblies and limit the ability to resolve repetitive genome loci where important immune gene loci reside. To overcome this limitation, we used a hybrid strategy combining both short- and long-read NGS technologies to generate a high-quality annotated genome for the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), an asymptomatic host of MARV (Towner et al., 2009). Here, we use this genome, the most contiguous bat genome available, to understand the evolution of immune genes and gene families in bats, and describe several observations relevant to defense against viruses.",

The expansion of NK cell receptors is matched by an expansion of potential MHC class I ligands, which are distributed both within and, surprisingly, outside the canonical MHC loci. We also observe that the type I IFN locus is considerably expanded and diversified in R. aegyptiacus. The IFN-\u03c9 subfamily contributes most to this expansion, and members of this subfamily are induced after viral infection and show antiviral activity. All these features strengthen the notion of the unique biology of bats and suggest the existence of a distinct immunomodulatory mechanism used to control viral infection.",

However, Raegyp2.0 has a larger contig N50 and a lower total gap length than any other available bat genome, making it the most contiguous bat genome to date (Table 1\n; Figures S1\nC and S1D). Whole-genome annotation was performed via the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline using all R. aegyptiacus-specific transcript and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in the NCBI databases, as well as proteins of other well-characterized species (Thibaud-Nissen et al., 2013). Similar to the number estimated by transcriptomic analysis (Lee et al., 2015, H\u00f6lzer et al., 2016) and the numbers in other bats (Table S2), 19,668 of the annotated genes in Raegyp2.0 are protein-coding genes with high support from transcriptomic or protein data.",

As previously established, the closest taxon to bats among the taxa included in the analysis is the horse (Equus caballus) (Seim et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2013). We performed gene family expansion and contraction analysis on inferred gene families and observed many more expanded families in microbats than megabats, similar to what has previously been shown (Zhang et al., 2013, Tsagkogeorga et al., 2017) (Figure 1). 55 gene families are significantly expanded in R. aegyptiacus compared to the megabat ancestor (Figure 1; Tables S3 and S4).",

Both complexes vary in gene content among species, and encode both inhibitory and activating receptors. We did not find functional KIRs in the LRC, but consistent with what was found in P. alecto (Papenfuss et al., 2012), we identified 14 NKG2A/B-like genes (referred to as NKG2-1 through NKG2-14, including four pseudogenes), one NKG2D-like gene, one NKG2C-like gene, and 5 CD94-like genes (Table S3).",

Of the remaining genes, three encode only inhibitory motifs, and only one gene encodes an activating motif alone (Figures 2A and 2B). No other potential NK cell receptor genes were found. While inhibitory NKG2 receptors signal via ITIMs in their cytoplasmic domains, activating CD94/NKG2 receptors transmit signals via a positively charged residue in their transmembrane domains. This residue recruits adaptor molecules that contain activating motifs, with a lysine residue associated with DAP12 recruitment, and an arginine residue associated with DAP10 recruitment. R. aegyptiacus NKG2 proteins with putative activating function show a strong preference for arginine at this location, suggesting that these receptors favor an association with DAP10 (Figure 2B).",

These cysteines participate in the disulfide-mediated heterodimeric interaction between CD94 and NKG2 proteins in humans (Kaiser et al., 2008, Petrie et al., 2008), suggesting that these CD94 molecules might interact with their NKG2 co-receptors in an alternate way. Mouse and rat CD94 are capable of direct association with DAP12 or DAP10 via a lysine residue in their transmembrane domains (Koch et al., 2013), but the CD94 sequences from all bats we examined have no lysine residues in their transmembrane regions, so are unlikely to associate directly with DAP proteins (Figure S4\nC).",

Each bat has one CD94 gene with canonical cysteine residues at position 58 and 59, (Figures 3A and S4A) and like R. aegyptiacus, multiple bats have CD94 genes without these residues, suggesting that they may have alternative functions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that NKG2 genes have undergone considerable diversification before and after the speciation of megabats (Figures 2D and S5\n). As with R. aegyptiacus, the putative functional and truncated NKG2 genes in both megabats (P. alecto and P. vampyrus) and microbats (M. lucifugus and M. davidii) contain ITIMs or both ITIMs and a positively charged transmembrane residue, suggesting that both inhibitory and activating signaling in these receptors is common among all bats in our analysis (Figure 2B).",

This mechanism is thought to allow NK cells to monitor the expression of cMHCs and deliver cytotoxic hits to cells lacking such expression (Yokoyama and Plougastel, 2003). We hypothesized that the expansion of the NKG2 receptor family would be matched by an expansion of cMHCs or ncMHCs. In humans, MHC class I genes are located in three areas referred to as the \u03b1, \u03ba, and \u03b2 duplication blocks, which are separated by framework regions containing non-HLA genes (Kulski et al., 2002). HLA-E and its functional equivalent in mice, H2-Qa1, are located in the \u03ba block. Raegyp2.0 appears to lack the \u03b1 and \u03ba blocks (Figure 4\nA), as do P. alecto and E. fuscus (Ng et al., 2016).",

Two MHC class I genes in Raegyp2.0 were found in genomic contexts apparently outside of the MHC class I region (Figure 4B). Eight genes and five pseudogenes were identified on scaffolds that could not be further localized in the genome. These could potentially be allelic variants or additional genomic contexts for MHC-I genes. Examination of additional bat genomes also shows MHC class I genes outside the canonical MHC class I region, suggesting that dispersion of class I genes is not an assembly artifact but is common to many bats (data not shown). Many of the MHC class I genes in Raegyp2.0 are expressed across a wide range of tissues, including genes located outside the canonical MHC locus (Figure 4C) like MHC-11 and -12, suggesting that they may function in the canonical self-detection role of cMHCs.",

This expansion is dramatically different from what was observed in P. alecto (Zhou et al., 2016), but is consistent with the expansion in P. vampyrus (Kepler et al., 2010). In our hands, at least one of the IFN-\u03c9 members, IFN-\u03c94, has a marked antiviral effect against VSV-eGFP infection in RoNi cells (Figure S7). However, the effect observed in this in vitro system, was less potent than that of IFN-\u03b2. Thus, IFN-\u03c94 most likely induces a unique ISG pattern and may be more effective against different viruses, or may induce lower levels of effectors in a more regulated response. Consistent with this latter scenario, Banerjee et al. (2017) have shown that poly I:C treatment induces type I IFNs in both human and Eptesicus fuscus bat cells, but bat cells express much lower levels of inflammatory mediators. A wider variety of signaling mediators may provide R. aegyptiacus greater flexibility to develop a more nuanced antiviral response. It is also possible that different IFN-\u03c9s may complement and/or synergize with each other.",

The unique organization, structure, and increased signaling complexity of the NK cell receptors in multiple bats point to adaptations that are also consistent with the infection tolerance hypothesis. Our findings suggest that NKG2/CD94 receptors, which are more associated with an inhibitory response in other species, serve as the primary NK cell receptors in bats. Consistent with this, all but one of the NKG2A/B-like genes in R. aegyptiacus have inhibitory motifs at the cytosolic tail. The expansion of CD94 genes makes the possible combinatorial diversity of heterodimeric receptors very large, as previously demonstrated for prosimians (Averdam et al., 2009).

In other mammals, KLRC genes are also expressed on T cells, and NKG2A has been shown to control the level of T cell activation during viral infection, preventing excessive activation and immunopathology in mice (Rapaport et al., 2015).

DAP12 has been shown to be more efficient in activating cytokine production than DAP10 (Lanier 2009), therefore a preference for DAP10 could mean that activating NK receptors in bats have adapted to be less potent inducers of cytokines, and thus less inflammatory.",

KIR2DL4 activation promotes robust cytokine secretion but not cytotoxicity (Kikuchi-Maki et al., 2005). It is possible that the R. aegyptiacus KLRC genes mimic the signaling of human KIR2DL4, although parallels between both receptors are difficult to make without functional assays. However, our genomic evidence suggests that NK cell receptors in bats are uniquely regulated, especially given the multiple changes in the signaling potential of these receptors, which are highly conserved in eukaryotes ranging from Drosophila to humans.",

A similar expansion and absence of a clear HLA-E ortholog has been observed in prosimians (Averdam et al., 2009). If one of the MHC class I genes in Raegyp2.0 is functionally similar to HLA-E, the high similarity of predicted class I nonamers (Figure 4E) suggests that presenting a peptide from one MHC class I molecule would likely be interchangeable with presenting a peptide from another. Thus, expression of MHC class I molecules would have to be dramatically decreased in order for \u201cmissing-self\u201d detection to occur. While functional orthologs cannot be inferred without functional assays, the large number of MHC genes encoded outside the canonical locus in the bats we studied (Figure 4B) may be suitable ligands for the expanded KLR genes. Distribution of the MHC genes across the genome might serve as a mechanism to generate redundancy as different KLRC receptors might interact with distinct MHC class I genes. This could potentially result in a higher activation threshold for NK cells.",

Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that certain key components of the immune system in bats have coevolved with viruses toward a state of respective tolerance and avirulence, although tolerance is likely not the only mechanism at play. For example, in addition to enhanced flexibility, the expansion of type I IFNs may also point to enhanced potency of antiviral defenses. Recent studies have shown that IFN stimulation in bats induces some ISGs that are not induced by IFN in humans, and that the response kinetics may vary as well (De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018). Adaptations in potency are also indicated by observations of lower viral loads in R. aegyptiacus bats compared to humans (Amman et al., 2015, Jones et al., 2015). Finally, even with mutual disarmament, the host must be alert to viruses that may spontaneously revert to an antagonistic phenotype. In either case, definitive tests of these hypotheses await the development of further experimental reagents for cytometry and biochemical intervention\u2014reagents that are being developed now with information made available by the completed genome project.",

LINKS was used iteratively until no improvement was observed in contiguity, which was after seven iterations.

Last, we reincorporated the paired-end information from our Illumina data for scaffolding with SSPACE v3.0 (Boetzer et al., 2011). As a post-processing step, we aligned the Illumina reads to the assembly using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and ran the variant calling program Pilon (Walker et al., 2014) on the resulting alignment to correct potential mis-assemblies, consensus calling errors, or homopolymer indel errors. We also tested the use of the Quiver algorithm from Pacific Biosciences as a post-processing step prior to pilon, but found that it reintroduced insertion and deletion errors that led to poor gene models.

            "text": "The assembly was submitted to GenBank (accession GCA_001466805.2) and annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline (Thibaud-Nissen et al., 2013). A total of 26.25% of the genomic sequence was identified as repetitive by the de novo repeat finder WindowMasker (Morgulis et al., 2006) and was masked for the purpose of aligning evidence and predicting genes. Transcripts and proteins available in GenBank and known RefSeq transcripts and proteins for bats and human were aligned to the genome with Splign (Kapustin et al., 2008) and ProSplign, along with model RefSeq proteins previously annotated on the Pteropus alecto and Myotis brandtii genomes. In addition, over 2 billion RNA-Seq reads derived from 12 different Rousettus aegyptiacus tissues and available in SRA were aligned. Model precursors were created by Gnomon (National Center for Biotechnology Information n.d.), a gene calling algorithm trained on Pteropus alecto, by collapsing overlapping alignments with compatible splice patterns. In a second step also run by Gnomon, model precursors with high coding propensity were extended or joined if missing start or stop codon using an HMM model. The resulting models were evaluated and filtered based on multiple criteria, including supporting evidence, conflicts with models on the other genomic strand, Blast hits to UniProtKB/SwissProt if over 50% ab initio sequence, and number of exons (single-exon non-coding RNA were eliminated). Models in the final set were assigned a function by orthology calculation to human, or if no ortholog could be calculated, by homology to proteins in UniProtKB/SwissProt. Finally, models were assigned GeneIDs and RefSeq model transcript and protein accession (with XM_, XP_, XR_ prefixes) and loaded to the Nucleotide, Protein and Gene databases as part of NCBI Rousettus aegyptiacus Annotation Release 100. The genome contains 36.4% repetitive content, similar to that found in other bats (Table S1). 19,668 of the annotated genes were protein-coding genes and 2,380 were non-coding genes. 2,198 coding sequences were corrected for premature stop codons, small internal gaps, or frameshifts based on aligning evidence (NCBI Eukaryotic Annotation Group, 2016). When present, the corrected models were used for downstream analysis. 5,958 long non-coding RNAs were predicted with full support from transcript data and 340 tRNA models were predicted with tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). 96.03% of predicted mRNAs were fully supported by transcriptomic or protein data. A total of 16,254 of predicted protein-coding genes (83%) had at least one protein aligning to a UniProtKB/SwissProt protein for over 95% of its length, which was higher than for any other bat annotated by the NCBI pipeline at the time. In addition, the number of the UniProtKB/SwissProt hits covered over 95% of their length by a predicted protein was similarly high (82%), indicating that the predicted proteins on Raegyp2.0 represent full-length models. Of the 19,668 protein-coding genes annotated in the genome, 317 genes have no associated gene labels or homolog in open reading frames from genomes of other species in RefSeq, and may represent novel R. aegyptiacus-specific genes. However, the median length of the protein product of these genes (257 amino acids) is significantly lower than the median length of all annotated proteins (498 amino acids). Thus, it remains a possibility that these genes have been previously identified in other species but are partial or poor models in Raegyp2.0 because of misannotation or local misassembly.",

Protein data were downloaded from RefSeq and filtered to include only the longest protein product of a gene for use in the pipeline. Briefly, OrthoMCL gathers all-against-all blastp hits into reciprocal best hits (between species) and reciprocal better hits (within species). These hits are converted into a graph network describing likely orthologous or paralogous relationships among proteins, and MCL clustering is performed to group proteins into families. Using OrthoMCL v2.0.9, we obtained 19,310 groups of proteins and 7,041 single-copy orthologous groups.",

We mapped all RefSeq accessions directly to PANTHER family IDs or to UniProtKB accessions for subsequent mapping to PANTHER IDs using bioDB, PantherDB, and/or the UniProtKB accession mapping feature (Mi et al., 2016, Mudunuri et al., 2009, UniProt Consortium, 2015). All OrthoMCL groups with the same PANTHER family ID were collapsed into new gene families, which produced a total of 9,555 gene families (2,400 single-copy orthologous gene families). Some families remain unlabeled after this process because proteins from relatively new genomes may be missing in PANTHER. Of note, 3,450 OrthoMCL groups did not map to PANTHER families and were designated unlabeled gene families for downstream analysis. Using this process, upon examining the type I IFN gene family, we observed that many genes were not accounted for despite being present in the NCBI annotation. We discovered that these genes were labeled as singletons or in families with only R. aegyptiacus proteins, and therefore would not be classified as a PANTHER family since no R. aegyptiacus proteins were in the PANTHER database at the time of analysis. We manually corrected the numbers of genes in this family based on NCBI annotations and yielding 9,550 families, 3,445 of which were unlabeled.",

Since CAFE assumes that all input gene families have at least one member in the most recent common ancestor of all species, gene families were filtered to exclude single lineage families. Only families with at least one gene in both the Laurasiatheria superorder (bats, ungulates, carnivores) and the Euarchontoglires superorder (primates, rodents) were included. We manually corrected type I IFN gene family sizes after observing that several genes that were annotated as type I IFNs by the NCBI did not appear in our inferred gene families. Further exploration revealed that these additional IFNs get classified as single gene families or as unlabeled gene families because they consist of only bat IFNs. The resulting families were further filtered to exclude eight families with large ranges in size (> 100) across the tree, leaving 7,698 families for expansion and contraction analysis. CAFE was used to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of a global birth and death rate parameter \u03bb (lambda; rate of gain/loss per gene per million years) across the species tree (created by above methods) of 0.0169284. The size of each family at each ancestral node was estimated and used to obtain a family-wise p value to indicate non-random expansion or contraction for each family, as well as significant expansion or contraction across all branches of the species tree. Tables S3 and S4 contain all the gene families with expansions and contractions in R. aegyptiacus prior to and post IFN-correction (described above), respectively.",

For example, out of the 12 genes classified as C-type lectins in our gene family analysis, one gene is missing exons and is considered a pseudogene. The NCBI gene database contains another gene annotated as an NKG2A-like gene, but was classified as a singleton in our gene family analysis because of missing exons. Additionally, one protein sequence identified as an NK cell receptor-like C-type lectin by our gene family analysis remained uncharacterized by the NCBI pipeline. Upon manual reannotation, we discovered that the uncharacterized protein sequence was actually a misannotation of two NKG2A-like genes\u2014one complete pseudogene and one partial gene.

The completed libraries were screened for quality with the High Sensitivity D1000 Screentape and Reagents on the Tapestation 2200 (Agilent) and the Library Qauntification kit (KAPA Biosystems). RNA-sequencing was performed using a dual-index paired end (2x125 bp) format on Illumina HiSeq 2500 with the Hiseq SBS Kit v4 (250 cycles) and the HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4 (Illumina). Raw reads were cleaned with Trimmomatic v0.33 (Bolger et al., 2014), aligned to the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome (from NCBI, supplemented with manually annotated type I IFN genes and NKG2 genes) and quantified in TPM using kallisto v0.43.0 as described above (Bray et al., 2016).",

We also included genes in DNA damage response pathways, since adaptations in DNA damage responses during the selection for flight in bats have been hypothesized to influence immune responses in bats (for a full list of genes studied, see Table S5). All genes of interest (immune genes, echolocation genes, flight genes) were downloaded from RefSeq in GenBank format and coding sequences for each gene were extracted using a python script. For each member of an ortholog group, the longest isoform was selected. Amino acid sequences of ortholog groups were aligned with Muscle v3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004). The resulting alignments were then trimmed with trimAl v1.4 (Capella-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2009) to retain only high-quality aligned regions and alignment columns containing gaps. We used codeml within the PAML v4.9b suite of phylogenetic analysis tools to estimate \u03c9 (omega), the nonsynonymous/synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratio, and \u03ba (kappa), the transition/transversion rate ratio with the F3 \u00d7 4 codon frequency matrix (Bielawski and Yang, 2005, Yang, 1998). Seven separate models were used (Figure S2) and maximum likelihood scores estimated for each. The models shown in Figure S2 describe the hierarchy of models tested for each gene included in the analysis. Likelihood ratio tests were performed, progressively allowing more degrees of freedom. Model 0 assumes one rate of evolution in all branches. The fit of three models (1a, 1b, and 1c) are separately compared to Model 0 via a likelihood ratio test, and the best fitting model (highest likelihood of the three) is then compared to the next model in the hierarchy (e.g., Model 1a is compared to 2a, Model 1c is compared to both 2a and 2b), and the best fitting model is then compared to Model 3. If the next model in the hierarchy does not fit the data better than the previous model, the previous model is taken to be the most likely.",

FDR was controlled at each level using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Models showing \u03c91 > 1 along any branch were then compared against two-ratio constrained models with \u03c91 fixed at 1 to test for neutral evolution.

The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to family-wide p values for the gene families that evolved differently than expected. The p values were ranked from lowest to highest with identical p values assigned the same rank, and the rank for the next non-identical p value incremented by the total size of the identical group. The rank of each p value was divided by the total number of hypotheses (7,698, for each gene family) and multiplied by 0.05 to obtain the adjusted p value with a false-discovery rate of 0.05. For families with adjusted p values < 0.05, the Viterbi p values were used to determine whether the expansion or contraction in a specific lineage was significant. Families with expansions and contractions in Figure 1 have family-wide adjusted p values less than 0.05 and Viterbi p values less than 0.05.",
