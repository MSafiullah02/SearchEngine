This enables individual transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) in the genome body (TRS-B) to come in close physical proximity to the single TRS in the leader (TRS-L) of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) during nascent strand synthesis. At each TRS-B sequence, the replication complex either continues transcription of genomic RNA template, or engages in a \u201ctemplate switch\u201d that generates minus-sense sgRNAs. These can subsequently function as templates for production of positive-sense sgRNA transcripts that are ultimately translated by host ribosomes into the structural proteins of the virus.",

            "text": "A structural and mechanistic understanding for how CoV N protein performs its myriad functional roles is limited. N proteins contain two RNA-binding domains of known structure: an N-terminal RNA binding domain (NTD) and a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD)20 linked by a Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker (Fig. S1). Biochemical data suggest that the CTD is involved in oligomerization of N dimers,20, 21, 22 and a small-angle x-ray scattering study suggests that the NTD and CTD do not interact in the absence of RNA.23 The structures of the CTD from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and SARS-CoV reveal a tightly intertwined domain-swapped dimer22, 24 with the CTD N-terminal region, rich in basic amino acids, implicated in nucleic acid binding.25, 26 The structures of the NTD from SARS-CoV26, 27 and IBV24, 28 N have also been reported. The SR-rich region has been implicated in RNA binding in MHV15 and in regulation of the oligomerization of SARS-CoV N29 and a recent report provides genetic evidence for N-N interactions mediated by the NTD.30 The reported affinity of N for U20 is in the 1-10 \u03bcM range (K\nd) with no evidence for or against RNA binding specificity.23\n",

To test this, we measured the binding affinity of a 5\u2032 fluorescein (F)-labeled decanucleotide corresponding to the MHV TRS (F-5\u2032-gAAUCUAAAC) with N219, an N domain protein fragment containing the folded NTD and the immediately adjacent intact SR-rich region (residues 60-219; Fig. S1), by fluorescence anisotropy. These data reveal that the N219-TRS complex is characterized by a K\nobs\n = 9.0 \u00d7 107 M-1 at 150 mM K+, 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 1, Table 1\n). To address the nucleotide specificity of NTD, we carried out fluorescence anisotropy-based RNA competition experiments with unlabeled mutant TRS RNAs (Fig. 1c; Table 1). Essentially all mutations in the TRS result in a decrease in K\nobs, with a random RNA of the same length binding 53-fold less tightly. Substitution of 65UCU67 with 65GAG67 (TRS-Y3r) results in a modest \u22482-fold decrease in K\nobs whereas complete replacement of the 68AAA70 sequence with 68CUU70 (TRS-R3y) results in a 20-fold decrease. Combining these two blocks of mutations into the same RNA (TRS-YR) suggests that these two effects are not additive (\u0394G\nc\n = \u20131.1 kcal mol-1), thus revealing that the 68AAA70 to 68CUU70 substitution is globally destabilizing to the interface. Finally, the complementary TRS sequence, 5\u2032-AGUUUAGAUU (cTRS), adheres exactly to the 5\u2032-RRYYYRRRYY motif present in the TRS; consistent with this, the affinity of N219 for a cTRS labeled with the rhodamine derivative, DY547, gives K\nobs\n = 9.1 \u00d7 107 M-1 (Table 1). These data taken collectively reveal that the MHV NTD forms a specific, high affinity complex with both the TRS and cTRS RNA sequences that would be present in the leader and body TRSs and the nascent minus-strand RNA transcript, respectively, during sgRNA transcription.",

N197 makes a high affinity complex with TRS, but one characterized by an approximately 5-fold decrease when compared to N219; this suggests that the nucleobase-specific interactions are contained entirely within the NTD. The increase in binding affinity is likely due to the presence of five additional positive charges from the SR-rich region, contributing a larger electrostatic component to the binding energy in N219 vs. N197. To test this, standard \u201csalt-back\u201d dissociation experiments were carried out to obtain information on the extent to which electrostatic interactions stabilize the NTD-TRS complex.34, 35\nSK\nobs, the dependence of K\nobs on [K+], for the N219-TRS interaction is large (SK\nobs\n =  \u20135.5), consistent with 7-8 ionic interactions in the complex for the RNA binding (Fig. S2), with 55% of the total binding free energy at 0.15 M K+contributed by the polyelectrolyte effect. In contrast, the SK\nobs of N197 is smaller, \u20133.9, with the polyelectrolyte contribution only \u224840% under these conditions. Thus, in this simplified polyelectrolyte model, N219 engages in 2-3 additional electrostatic interactions with the RNA, likely contributed by a subset of the C-terminal Arg residues in N219 vs. N197.",

Of particular note is that the difference in binding free energy between these two N219 proteins is entirely enthalpic in nature, i.e. \u0394\u0394G\n = \u0394\u0394H, with \u0394(\u2013T\u0394S) = 0.

In contrast, the energetics of the binding of N219 to the TRS-A70u RNA, which harbors a single base substitution of the \u201368AAA70-motif, reveal a significant decrease in the entropic penalty coupled with a vastly different \u0394H relative to the wild-type TRS RNA.

Two putative TRS sequences have been proposed for SARS-CoV,37, 38 with the first containing the 5\u2032-CUAAAC core observed in other CoVs and the second, 5\u2032-ACGAAC, just downstream and overlapping the first (see Fig. 5a). Using the second putative TRS sequence, Baric and coworkers reported a \u2018rewiring\u2019 of the SARS-CoV genome by making parallel mutations in the TRS-L and TRS-B39 (Fig. 5a); however, these mutations are not expected to appreciably affect the binding affinity of N for the SARS-CoV TRS. We tested this using a 15-nucleotide 5\u2032-Cy3/3\u2032-Cy5 labeled SARS-CoV TRS (Fig. 5b). By monitoring the anisotropy upon direct excitation of Cy5, we find that N219 binds to this RNA with a binding affinity of K\nobs\n =  2.9 \u00d7 107 M-1 (Table 1). The \u22483-fold decrease in affinity is explained by the fact that the SARS-CoV TRS may exist as a weak stem-loop,40 giving rise to a competing equilibrium associated with melting the stem (Fig. 5a-b). The existence of the stem-loop in the doubly-labeled RNA was confirmed by a FRET efficiency (E) of \u22480.5 (Fig. 5c), a value consistent with a hairpin-unfolded RNA equilibrium (Fig. 5b). Regardless, stoichiometric N219 fully denatures this stem since E goes to zero. Companion ITC experiments further reveal that the \u0394H\nobs, is \u22488 kcal mol-1 less negative compared to the MHV TRS (Table 1, Fig. 5d, Table S4); this is as expected if endothermic stem melting is coupled to N219 binding. To verify this, a broken-stem mutant (bsSARS), which corresponds to two of the three mutations used in the rewiring study, was investigated along with the fully rewired TRS (rwSARS) RNA (Fig. 5a). The resulting increase in K\nobs and \u2013\u0394H\nobs observed for each of these RNAs is consistent with N219-inducing melting of the helical stem in the wild-type SARS-TRS RNA (Table S4).",

Addition of N219 results in an increase in the Cy3 emission intensity with a concomitant decrease in the Cy5 emission intensity to a FRET efficiency of zero, indicative of complete duplex melting. The subsequent addition of KCl to these mixtures results in dissociation of the N219-ssRNA complexes (see Fig. S2), and full recovery of the FRET efficiency associated with the duplex; this shows that N219-mediated RNA unwinding is fully reversible (Fig. S5). A quantitative analysis of these data to an equilibrium model that explicitly invokes the possibility that N219 binds to the duplex (K\n4 in Model 5, Materials and Methods) reveals an affinity of<1 M-1, i.e., this complex does not form. In contrast, while the CTD dimer clearly binds to this duplex, it is unable to denature it, even under conditions where K\nobs are comparable for the two domains (35 mM K+vs. 150 mM K+) (Fig. 6b; Table S1).",

In addition, there is a significant enhancement of the Cy5 emission intensity upon addition of Y127A N219 not observed with wild-type N219; this appears to be the result of a Y127A:dsRNA complex, since direct excitation of the single-stranded 3\u2032-Cy5-cTRS RNA:Y127A N219 complex yields no such enhancement (Fig. S6).

Finally, for both Y127A N219 and WT N197, the FRET efficiency fails to return to zero even after very long incubation times with saturating N protein, as expected for the full duplex dissociation observed for wild-type N219 (Fig. 6b,d). This finding suggests an incomplete melting of the dsTRS RNA, implying a partially melted, long-lived intermediate complex with these two proteins (Fig. 6e).

We show here that MHV N219 forms a high-affinity complex with both the MHV and non-cognate SARS-CoV TRS39 a finding that speaks to the conservation of the NTD-TRS interaction as a conserved feature of CoV replication, despite the distinct structural contexts of the leader TRS in each case. We also show that the N NTD possesses potent helix-destabilizing activity. The NTD employs enthalpically stabilizing base stacking interactions to drive high affinity and sequence-specific complex formation with the single-stranded TRS and cTRS RNAs. This binding, in turn, strongly enhances the rate of TRS-cTRS duplex melting that models an intermediate in sgRNA transcription by the coronaviral replicase complex. Full helix-destabilizing activity of the N NTD requires determinants on both the \u03b2-platform, i.e., Y127, as well as the SR-rich domain. Although we have not determined the RNA binding specificity ratio of N197 (K\nsp; see below), comparative studies of N197 and N219 suggest that the \u03b2-platform domain provides key specificity determinants for TRS recognition, with the SR-rich region stabilizing the complex via non-specific electrostatic interactions, likely with the region just 5\u2032 to the TRS core sequence. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of S170 or T177 in MHV N,10 the latter of which is in close proximity to the C-terminal \u03b25 strand, or Ser residues within SR-rich domain,9 might strongly modulate the ssRNA and helix-melting properties of the N protein.",

While K\nsp is modest when compared to bona fide sequence-specific RNA binding proteins,42 it appears to be of the same order of magnitude determined for another viral nucleocapsid protein, from HIV-1.43 Such a relatively small specificity ratio is not inconsistent with a N219-TRS binding mode that is characterized by a sizable electrostatic contribution to the binding energy, as well as the multiple functional roles N protein must play in the viral life cycle. It is striking, nonetheless, that a single Y127A substitution within the highly conserved WY127FY129Y sequence on the \u03b23-strand, like that of a complete pyrimidine substitution of the triple adenosine motif 68AAA70 (in the 10-mer context), reduces the binding affinity to just three-fold above what we operationally define as non-sequence specific binding. In contrast, single adenosine to pyrimidine substitutions within this 68AAA70 are not as destabilizing, but nearly additive (\u0394\u0394G\n = 1.5 kcal mol-1) relative to the complete 68AAA70 to 68CUU70 substitution (\u0394\u0394G\n = 1.8 kcal mol-1), with the 3\u2032-most A70 making the largest single contribution to the N219-TRS binding energy. These data are consistent with a model in which the 3\u2032 end of the TRS is anchored on the \u03b2-platform via enthalpically stabilizing aromatic base-stacking interactions with the 5\u2032 side of the TRS held in place largely by electrostatic interactions that extend into the SR-rich tail.",

FRET experiments were carried out with RNA labeled with a Cy3-Cy5 pair (\u03bbex\n = 520 nm; \u03bbem\n = 550-700 nm; Cy3 \u03bbmax\n = 570 nm; Cy5 \u03bbmax\n = 670 nm).with the FRET efficiency, E, calculated from E\n =  1-(I\nDA/I\nD), where I\nD is the Cy3 quantum yield and I\nDA is the Cy3 quantum yield in the presence Cy5, following a 2-10 min equilibration upon addition of the titrant. No change in the fluorescence intensity (quantum yield) of the component Cy3-and Cy5-labeled TRS and cTRS single-stranded RNAs, respectively, was observed; thus changes in I\ni are directly attributed to FRET or protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) (see Fig. S6).41 Nonlinear least-squares fits to all binding isotherms were carried out using DynaFit56 with the appropriate binding model (models (1)\u2013(5), as indicated below).",
