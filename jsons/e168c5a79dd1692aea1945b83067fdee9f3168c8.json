However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant selection pressure, with new M pro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of M pro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine M pro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences 1 in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.",

Although the sequence of its RNA genome is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have arisen independently from a bat coronavirus (2) , to which it shares 96% similarity (3) . The emerging SARS-CoV-2 subsequently gained a modified spike protein due to recombination in an intermediate host, the pangolin (4, 5) , followed by purifying selection for binding to the human ACE2 protein (6) . No therapeutic agents able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 mortality in clinical settings are yet known, although extensive efforts are underway to discover new drugs or repurpose existing ones to inhibit key viral proteins. Here we focus on the main protease (M pro ), which plays a critical role in viral replication. Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that expresses all of its proteins as a single polypeptide chain, which is cleaved by M pro to yield the mature proteins (7) .",

A similar approach was instrumental in making HIV a manageable disease (8) (9) (10) . However, the proteins in question differ markedly, rendering HIV protease inhibitors ineffective against SARS-CoV-2; indeed, a standard HIV protease inhibitor combination did not prove effective against COVID-19 in a recent clinical trial (11) . Specifically, HIV protease is an aspartic protease (and functional only as a dimer, as the active site comprises one residue from each monomer), whereas M pro is a 3CL cysteine protease that is likewise most active in the dimeric state, although each monomer has its own catalytic dyad (12) . The 3CL cysteine proteases are characterized by a chymotrypsin-like fold and a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad 2 in the active site, implying both different structures and distinct chemical mechanisms. While the general strategy of seeking protease inhibitors is hence viable for both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, drug development for the former depends on characterizing this novel enzyme.",

In a host population, mutations accumulate with each viral passage, generating a mutational landscape rather than a single protein. The design of robust inhibitors that can protect against the multiple strains encountered in clinical settings requires characterization of this sequence space and the populations of conformations it engenders. Furthermore, effective and rapid response to future emerging coronavirus diseases requires both in silico screening and experimental testing of antiviral agents and a validated library of relatively general inhibitors that can be used as a basis for the development of specialized therapeutics.",

Here we characterize all 79 known variants of M pro as of 29 April, 2020, and analyze trends in amino acid substitutions and the resulting structural changes using network analysis and molecular modeling. To our knowledge this is the first detailed analysis of clinically relevant mutations in M pro . Our analysis shows a trend toward substitution for larger and more hydrophobic residues versus the WT protein. Analysis of active site networks (ASN) from M pro variants suggests differences in active site flexibility and cohesion that may serve to guide the design of robust, mutation-resistant inhibitors.",

For genome sequences containing these M pro variants, full genome alignments were performed using MUSCLE (14) , and neighbor-joining trees were generated using MEGA X (15) . Overall, the variation in SARS-CoV-2 sequences observed so far is relatively low, with mutation hotspots not evenly distributed throughout the genome, but localized to specific sequence regions (16) . Because M pro is critical for viral replication, mutations that have a large deleterious effect on virus replication are unlikely to be observed in clinical isolates; all M pro variants investigated here are therefore assumed to be enzymatically competent. In general, codon usage and amino acid frequency in viruses of eukaryotes are essentially identical to those of their eukaryotic hosts, reflecting the viruses' use of the host translation machinery (17) . M pro sequences found in sequences isolated from human hosts will therefore likely reflect bias toward human codon usage, somewhat limiting the scope of the observed mutation space.",

The repeated occurrence of the same mutation in seemingly unrelated subtrees may be due to missing data that would show their evolutionary connectedness. The average branch length of Figure 1 , which shows only topology, is 1.432161x10 \u22124 base substitutions per site (including those from the bat (3) and pangolin (19) ); 32.2% of the 1028 branches have, to ten significant figures, 0 base substitutions per site. For a genome of roughly 30,000 base pairs, this amounts to an average of only 4 substitutions per branch. All of these unique mutants therefore effectively belong to the same strain, making them difficult to place in an evolutionary context. For more diverged mutants, unfortunately-placed ambiguous nucleotides (20) could push them from one subtree to another. With the exception of five double variants, a majority of the sequences in Figure 1 arise from single point mutations. Whether and how M pro mutations have affected viral fitness is not yet known, but at least three mutants have remained in the population long enough to accumulate another mutation: L220F to A191V/L220F, G15S to G15S/D48E and G15S/V35L, and K90R to V77A/K90R. It is worth noting that although a single variant A191V exists, the A191V/L220F double variant likely stemmed from an L220F ancestor due to its shared lineage with L220F single variants.",

Testing rates, social behavior, and time of first infection in each region are all factors that contribute to the spread of the disease and the availability of sequencing data. For instance, a large number of K90R mutants were collected in Iceland, where the number of tests per 1,000 people is 5 nearly twice as many as the next leading country's and more than seven times as many as the United States' (Iceland: 141.75, USA: 18.21, as of 29 April, 2020) (21) . Consequently, further investigation is needed to determine whether M pro mutations affect viral fitness on a global scale. As such, without greater divergence and more sequences, it is difficult to tell if the presence of an M pro mutation in unrelated subtrees is evidence of multiple evolutionary events, or an artifact of sparse testing.",

For instance, 83 of the 100 M pro mutants from Iceland were K90R, and most stemmed from a single shared ancestor (Supplementary Table S2). Further, it is likely that heterogeneity in sequencing rates have resulted in a less-thancomplete dataset. As of April 29th, the only North American, South American, and African M pro mutants reported in the GISAID database that passed our filtering parameters were from Costa Rica and the USA, Argentina and Brazil, and the DRC respectively. This does not necessarily indicate a lack of M pro mutations in other subregions, and may instead reflect differences in sequencing rates.

Similarly, observed ties to isoleucine are mostly incoming from smaller residues, and leucine, which is also large and hydrophobic, likewise has more incoming than outgoing ties overall, with the bulk of its outgoing ties going to phenylalanine. However, aromatic residues per se do not appear to be selected at a higher rate than can be explained by their hydrophobicity. Also notable is the selection away from the secondary structure-breakers proline and glycine, both of which have only outgoing ties, and the propensity for lysine to be replaced by arginine even though both side chains are positively charged. Arginine is both larger and capable of making more and stronger hydrogen bonds, as well as cation-\u03c0 interactions not available to lysine, leading to its known overrepresentation in inter-domain and inter-monomer interfaces (26) (27) (28) (29) .",

Panels A-C show different views of the M pro dimer (left) and monomer (right.) One chain of the dimer is shown in black; on this monomer, only the active site residues His 41 (magenta) and Cy 145 (yellow) are shown in space-filling representations. On the section monomer (gray) side-chains of the mutated residues are also shown, using the following color coding to indicate the properties of the substituted residue: light gray -polar to nonpolar; teal -polar to polar; sky blue -nonpolar to polar; light green -polar to nonpolar; and salmonmultiple mutations (i.e. two or more independent substitutions with different properties.) Table S2 : Accession numbers, locations, and dates of collection of variants as they appear in the uncompressed version of the tree depicted in Figure 1 , which is available for download as a .txt file. Variants in bold are shown as individual branches in Figure 1 . Those without accession numbers or dates represent subtrees that were compressed; their constituent variants reside underneath.",

The \u03b2-sheet-rich structure around the active site is also relatively well conserved. By contrast, we see relatively high levels of between-variant difference in the inter-domain region involving the termini (residues G2-A7 and S301-F305) and the double loop \"active site gateway\" region involving (respectively) L50-Y54 and D187-A191.

Overall, the majority of variants are less cohesive than WT globally and in domains 1 and 2, while domain 3 cohesion in WT is typical of the variant set.13The relatively high levels of conformational variation in the inter-domain regions suggest functionally relevant differences in global cohesion across variants. To assess this, we employ protein structure networks (PSNs), which are well-suited to assessing the looseness or cohesiveness of contacts among chemical groups. Moiety-level PSNs were constructed for each frame within each variant trajectory, using the definitions of (32) (SupplementaryFigure S4). The assessment of global cohesion was performed by computing the mean degree k-core number for all moieties in each structure; to allow comparison of global cohesion within domains, we also compute mean core numbers within each of the three domains. The mean core number can be considered an index of structural cohesion, with higher values indicating greater numbers of redundant contacts among chemical groups(33). To account for within-trajectory autocorrelation in comparing mean core numbers, autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors were employed.",

(Means and standard errors for each variant can be found in Supplementary Table S1.) As suggested from the torsion angle analysis, cohesion differs significantly among variants, both globally and within domains. On average, the majority of variants are estimated to be less cohesively structured than WT, with the exception of domain 3 (in which WT does not differ significantly from the mean). It is possible that these differences indicate selection for more globally flexible structures (again, with the exception of domain 3). Whether or not this is the case, however, it appears clear that less cohesive structures are not strongly selected against. Such flexibility may affect dimerization kinetics, which is potentially relevant to the development of robust dimerization inhibitors.Active site networks suggest potential activity differences across M pro variantsThe observation of structural variation in loop regions associated with the binding pocket motivates closer examination of variation in the M pro active site. To this end, subgraphs of the full protein structure networks comprising moieties belonging to the active site residues and their neighbors were constructed to produce active site networks (ASNs) (34) for all conformations. A protein's ASN describes physical interactions among active site moieties and other groups that are immediately adjacent in the 3D structure, irrespective of their positions in the amino acid sequence. Per (34), we compute for each ASN a constraint score, a general measure of active site flexibility that is associated with substrate specificity. The constraint score is the first principal component of a set of several network metrics (see Methods), with higher values indicating a greater tendency for the catalytic residues to be constrained by cohesive contacts with other residues, and lower values indicating fewer such constraints. Examples of ASNs corresponding to the maximum, minimum, and mean observed constraint values over all observed M pro conformations are shown in Fig. 5. Examination of the mean constraint scores for each variant trajectory suggests potential activity differences across M pro variants. Fig. 5A shows mean constraint scores for each variant, with autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals. Of the 79 trajectories examined, 22 (28%) were significantly below the grand mean (dotted vertical line) and 28 (35%)",

Thus, although we do not see evidence here of systematic selection for net changes in active site constraint, we do see evidence that variants differ from each other and from WT in their average active site properties. These differences should be considered in the design of inhibitors that are robust to mutational change in M pro over time. In particular, it is clear that the population of extant M pro variants already possesses some phenotypic diversity in active site flexibility, potentially facilitating its ability to evolve around some types of inhibitors.MethodsSequence analysis and clusteringSARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were found by searching the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (13) EpiCoV database on 3 May, 2020, using the host keyword \"human\" and a cutoff date of 29 April, 2020, yielding a total of 15,432 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Genomes outside the range of \u00b1 3% reference (RefSeq: NC 045512.2) length (29,006bp -30,800bp inclusive) or \u2265 1% N content were removed, leaving 10,644 \"high-quality\" sequences. Open reading frames in these high-quality full genomes were compared with a reference Mpro nucleotide sequence (WT, Ref-Seq: NC 045512.2, loc: 10,055-10,972), to extract Mpro sequences of at least 80% similarity using a script written in Python v3.7.0 (35). Genomes with gaps or ambiguous nucleotides (e.g. N, S, D, per International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature (20)), in the Mpro sequence were excluded from this data set, leaving a total of 10,578 sequences from high-coverage genomes.Nucleotide sequences were converted into amino acid sequences and screened for nonsynonymous mutations against the WT M pro using code written in Wolfram Mathematica 12.1(36), yielding 511 non-synonymous mutations in M pro , 77 of which were unique. A single unique Mpro variant, found in a 24 April, 2020 dataset, but no longer available in the GISAID database, was also used in our analyses. Full genome alignments were performed using MUS-CLE (14) on the complete set of non-synonymous Mpro mutants as well as reference WT, bat, and pangolin sequences. Trees were generated in MEGA X (15), using the Neighbor-Joining method (37); a bootstrap test(38) of 1000 replicates was performed, and distances were calculated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model(38). In all, 515 full genomes were used in phylogenetic analyses; 78 unique Mpro mutants and a reference WT sequence (79 total)",

            "text": "protein structure network (PSN) was calculated for each modeled conformation of each variant via scripts employing the statnet(46)(47)(48), Rpdb(49), and bio3d (50) libraries for R(51). Vertices were defined using the method of (32), where each node represents a chemical moieity, with edges being defined by interatomic contacts. Specifically, two nodes i and j are considered adjacent if i contains atom g and j contains atom h such that the g, h distance is less than 1.1 times the sum of their respective van der Waals radii (using values from(52)). The node definitions are illustrated in SupplementaryFigure S4A, and a small-moiety PSN of this type for WT M pro is shown in SupplementaryFigure S4B. Active site networks (ASNs) were constructed from each PSN as described in(34). Briefly, all vertices belonging to the catalytic Cys and His residues were identified, along with all vertices adjacent to these vertices within the PSN. The ASN was then defined as the subgraph of the corresponding PSN induced by thiscombined vertex set (Supplementary Figure S4C.)To assess overall cohesion, degree k-core values (53) were calculated for each vertex in each PSN, and the average core number was computed for the entire protein and for the vertices in each domain, respectively. All calculations were performed using the sna library (48) for R. For each vertex associated with a moiety in the active site, three measures identified as associated with active site constraint by(34) were computed: the degree, or number of ties to other vertices; the triangle degree, or number of triangles (3-cliques) to which the vertex belongs; and core number, or number of the highest degree k-core(54) to which the vertex belongs. Physically, these respectively indicate the total number of contacts associated with the chemical group (potentially impeding its motion), the number of truss-like, triangular structures in which the group is embedded (again, restricting mobility), and the extent of local cohesion around the chemical group, which is found to distinguish \"tighter\" and \"looser\" packing regimes(33). To summarize the impact of each measure over the active site as a whole, values were averaged across active-site vertices. As an an additional constraint measure, the number of paths between each pair of active-site vertices through neighboring (i.e., non-active site) vertices wascomputed, and the log of the minimum of this value over the set of active site vertex pairs was employed as a measure of site cohesion. Intuitively, high values of site cohesion indicate that all active site chemical groups are connected by a large number of indirect contacts, while low values suggest that at least one pair of active site moieties has few local pathways holding them together. These four indices (mean active site degree, mean active site triangle degree, mean active site core number, and site cohesion) were used to produce an omnibus index of site constraint via principal component analysis (PCA) of the standardized network measures over all modeled conformations, per the approach of (34). This first principal component (the constraint score) accounted for approximately 71% of the variance in all four measures, and the ratio of its associated eigenvalue to the next largest was approximately 4.7 (confirming the dominance of the principal eigenvector).Comparing mean cohesion and constraint scores across variants: Because cohesion and constraint scores are heavily autocorrelated within trajectories, we employ a parametric bootstrap strategy to obtain autocorrelation-corrected standard errors and confidence intervals(55).For each time series of scores for each trajectory, an autoregressive (AR) model with AICselected order was fit, and the estimated series mean obtained. (Estimation performed by maximum likelihood estimation using the ar function in R (51).) The whitened residuals from the time series model were then used to construct 5,000 parametric bootstrap replicate series, which were then re-fit to obtain bootstrap replicate means. Mean estimates from the bootstrap replicates were used to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors for the series mean, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. This procedure was applied to the MD trajectory for each variant. For the WT comparisons shown in Figs. 4 and 5, t values for mean constraint or cohesion score of each variant trajectory versus WT were constructed using the bootstrapestimated standard errors, with variant trajectories indicated in red or blue (respectively) if the differences of their mean scores versus WT led to t statistics below -2 or above 2. For cohesion scores, mean and bootstrap standard errors are provided for the full protein and each domain in Supplementary Table S1. Author Contributions R.W.M. and C.T.B. designed the study.
