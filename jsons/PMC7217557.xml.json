            "text": "The spreading of certain behaviors (contagion) in the human society has social, economical, and political implications, which has attracted a great deal of interdisciplinary research effort. Conventional methods developed to uncover and understand the dynamics of social contagion are more or less based on some kind of threshold and memory effects [1\u201310]. For example, it is likely for an individual to adopt certain behavior if he/she possesses friends who have already adopted the behavior. From a network point of view, for a node to adopt certain behavior, the number of connected nodes who have already accepted and exhibit the behavior must exceed a threshold [1,11]. That is, an individual will become willing to adopt a behavior if he/she has received sufficient and repeated information about the behavior from his/her friends (or neighbors in the underlying social network) [12,13]. In the real world, the influences of network neighbors and the tendency for any individual to adopt certain behavior can be highly nonuniform. There is empirical evidence that individuals and their social contacts tend to play heterogeneous roles in contagion [14,15]. For example, regardless of the nature of the behavior, there always exist certain individuals who are reluctant to accept or adopt the behavior. To account for the heterogeneity, a variant of the classic threshold model [1] was introduced [11], where a certain fraction of nodes were assumed to be immune to the behavior. These are the blocked nodes, and if their number or density is large enough, both the extent and diffusion speed of the contagion spreading will be suppressed, provided that no cascading or avalanche type of processes occur. The effects of heterogeneity in social contacts have been recently studied [16] using a contagion threshold model incorporating weighted edges, with the finding that heterogeneity in the weights can suppress the propagation of contagion.",

In recent years, spreading dynamics driven by reinforcement have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers in diverse fields including social science, economics, and physics [9,12,17\u201320]. The key fact that motivated our present work is that, with respect to reinforcement, the nature of social contacts can have drastically different impacts. In particular, from close social contacts such as family members, friends, and colleagues, reinforcement can be much stronger than that from conventional or ordinary social contacts with, e.g., strangers. For a model of social contagion to capture the real behaviors as accurately as possible, the distinct reinforcement effects from close and ordinary social contacts must be taken into account.",

            "text": "The need to distinguish two types of social contacts in terms of their influences has been well documented in the literature. Historically, Lazarsfeld and Merton pointed out that mass media messages can be reinforced by interpersonal communications [21]. There were empirical evidence and theories for the conjecture that more interpersonal conversation or discussions can promote the impact of media information through reinforcement [22,23]. In general, individuals are more likely to engage in interpersonal communications with family, friends or colleagues as often as they get media news or messages from newspapers or other individuals [24]. That is, for reinforcement, close social contacts are more effective than interaction with machines or strangers. At the present, there exists considerable empirical evidence that, even for interpersonal communications, there is heterogeneity in their role in social reinforcement. In general, the degree of reinforcement depends on factors such as individual responsiveness, the number of neighbors capable of reinforcing, and respondent-reinforcer pairing [25\u201327]. For example, the number of reinforcers is determined by the degree of the individual in the social network, and reinforcement among strangers, even if there are social contacts among them, is far less likely than that among close relationships [27]. That is, in reality, social contagion is strongly contact-based, and not all social contacts can lead to reinforcement.",

In general, both types of contacts exist, and the question is how their coexistence affects the basic dynamical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a general model of social contagion with two distinct transmission channels: one through close and another through ordinary contacts. For random networks, we develop an analytical edge-based compartmental method to solve the model, which enables us to make a number of predictions in terms of the fundamental characterizing quantities such as the final outbreak size, the outbreak threshold, and the nature of the phase transition. We also carry out extensive agent-based, stochastic simulations to assess the performance of the model. For random networks, the computations reveal that continuous (second order) and discontinuous (first order) phase transitions coexist in random networks, which is ascertained by an analytic bifurcation analysis of the system. A computational study of two representative empirical networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution from the real world reveals that only continuous transitions can be expected. We provide a physical understanding of the basic spreading dynamics through a detailed statistical analysis, uncover the conditions under which contagion prevalence can arise, and validate the existence of an optimal fraction of ordinary contacts for outbreak at a global scale.",

In particular, only when there are propagation paths of sufficient length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large-scale outbreaks of social contagions possible. The second phenomenon is that, for heterogeneous networks, a considerable number of close contacts will promote outbreak of the contagion by forming channels for successful transmissions among hubs. Taken together, ordinary contacts make possible spreading over the entire network, while close contacts not only shape the way by which outbreaks occur, i.e., through a second or first order phase transition in random networks, but also facilitate local spreading and outbreaks in heterogeneous networks. These results provide quantitative insights into how social behaviors can emerge and become prevalent, which has potential implications not only to social science, but also to economics and political science.",

The total number of edges is E=N\u2329k\u232a/2, where each edge represents a particular social contact between two individuals. The dynamics of social contagion are governed by the standard susceptible-adopted-recovered (SAR) model, where any node (individual) can be in one of the three states. In particular, a node in the susceptible state may adopt a behavior when it receives information about it from its neighbors who have already adopted the behavior. If a node is in the adopted state, then with certain probability it will transmit the information to its susceptible neighbors. A node in the recovered state is \u201cidle\u201d and does not transmit any information. A unique feature, which makes our model distinct from the classic SAR model, is that there are two distinct ways for an adopted node to transit information to a susceptible neighbor, depending on whether the underlying social contact is close or ordinary. Empirical evidence [25\u201327] suggests that the transmission associated with a close contact contributes to reinforcement, but that with an ordinary contact does not. For a close contact, there is a memory effect in that the number m of times that a susceptible node receives the information from the adopted neighbors is stored and used to determine the probability that the node actually adopts the behavior [13], making the underlying dynamics non-Markovian. However, for an ordinary contact, a susceptible individual would accept the behavior from any adopted neighbor with probability p. We subsequently extend our model to empirical networks.",

The remaining edges represent ordinary contacts. A contagion is initiated within a single adopted cluster of size N\u03c10, while the remaining nodes are in the susceptible state. The spreading process starts and proceeds according to the SAR model, and the nodal dynamical states evolve using the synchronous updating rule. Specifically, an individual (i) who has adopted the behavior attempts to transmit the behavioral information to its susceptible neighbors (j). For a close social contact, the transmission from the adopted end to the susceptible end occurs with probability q, and j will successfully adopt the message or behavior only if it has received the information at least T times, where T is the adoption threshold. In this case, there is reinforcement. For an ordinary contact, j becomes adopted with probability p, or the transmission rate, without contributing to the accumulated times m. The spreading process is repeated until all adopted individuals become extinct in the network and the dynamics have reached a stable steady state.",

In our model, a node u in a cavity state cannot transmit the behavioral information to its neighbors but can receive it from others [32]. The dynamical correlation among the states of the neighbors is characterized by the two types of the contacts. If node u with degree ku is susceptible at time t, then it does not belong to the cluster of initial seed of contagion and it receives the information less than T times from close contacts. We write ku=kuC+kuO, where kuC and kuO are the numbers of close and ordinary contacts of u, respectively. Let \u03b8X(t) (X\u2208{C,O}) be the probability that, up to time t, the message or behavioral information has not been successfully transmitted from one end of one close or ordinary contact of v to the other end u. Combining the two conditions, we obtain the probability that node u is in the susceptible state as\n(1)s(k,t)=(1\u2212\u03c10)\u2211kC=0kkkC\u03bck(1.0\u2212\u03bc)k\u2212kC\u00d7\u2211mC=0T\u22121\u03d5mCC(kC,t)\u03b8Ok\u2212KC,where \u03d5mCC is the probability that node u has received mC pieces of information from close contacts by time t.

            "text": "A fundamental feature of the spreading dynamics of social contagion is the emergence of phase transitions: as a system parameter varies through a critical point, an outbreak occurs. The transition can be continuous (second order) or discontinuous (first order). To gain insights into the role of close versus ordinary contacts in the characteristics of phase transition, we calculate the final fraction of the recovered population for different values of T and \u03bc numerically and theoretically, as shown in Fig. 1. In all cases, there is a phase transition. As the fraction of close contacts in the network is increased, there is a change in the nature of the phase transition from being continuous to discontinuous, where the abrupt change in the final recovered population at the transition point can be quite large for relatively large values of the fraction. The dynamical origin of the discontinuity can be attributed to the relative abundance of the close contacts that lay the ground for the occurrence of a drastic avalanche type of process, as suggested by the previous result that a sufficient number of close contacts with a relatively large transmission rate can trigger a massive outbreak of contagion [13,34]. For relatively higher values of the adoption threshold T, second order transitions are more likely, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The reason lies in the susceptible individuals in the critical state, i.e., the individuals who have been informed by their adopted neighbors through close contacts but have not adopted the message or information yet. For a large value of T, it is more difficult to make these individuals adopt the behavior, thereby requiring more transmission to trigger a massive adoption process. The contribution of reinforcement in this case is insignificant, leading to a smaller avalanche size [34,35]. Note the good agreement between numerical and theoretical results, which validates the edge-based compartmental approach.\n",

There are three distinct scenarios: continuous transition [Fig. 6(a)], transition at the triple point [Fig. 6(b)], and discontinuous transitions [Fig. 6(c)]. For the continuous transition, the graphical solution (the crossing point between the two relevant curves) moves gradually away from the position of \u03b8s=1 and \u03b8n=1 to that of \u03b8s<1 and \u03b8n<1. The crossing point begins to leave the top right corner of the plot at the critical point p=pC. Associated with the triple point transition, although there exists one crossing point, two curves are close to each other near the crossing point that tends to move abruptly, which is indicative of a discontinuous transition. Note that the triple point can be estimated with the aid of pattern features of the solution lines, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). For the discontinuous transitions, a solution for which the crossing points decrease from three (corresponding to contagion decay) to two (corresponding to contagion outbreak) until only one (contagion prevailing). Furthermore, Eq. (16) gives the tangent point of the two curves presented in the second subplot of Fig. 6(c). The crossing point (yellow solid circles) closest to the top right corner of the plot (i.e., \u03b8s=1 and \u03b8n=1) is physically meaningful, because the dynamics start from the initial conditions \u03b8s\u22481 and \u03b8n\u22481. The movement of the yellow points is caused by the shift of blue lines, indicating again the role played by the transmission events due to ordinary contacts in the phase transition.\n",

Note that the numerically identified critical boundaries and the analytically estimated triple point are included. Both figures represent evidence for the coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions separated by the triple point. More specifically, smooth color variations and dramatic differences in the color indicate continuous and discontinuous types of transition, respectively. There is an overall good agreement between the simulation results and the analytic predictions, although there is deviation between the two types of results in the region of large values of \u03bc. The discrepancies are somewhat expected, due to the numerical uncertainties in identifying the outbreak phase of the contagion through a finite number of statistically independent realizations. In general, the analytical predictions are more reliable, as evidenced by the better agreement with the numerical results for the limited parameter setting in which more extensive stochastic simulations are computationally feasible (e.g., the results in Figs. 1 and 3). The results in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that the threshold and transition classes are predominately determined by the relative abundance of close contacts with respect to ordinary contacts in the underlying social network. Another feature is that the spreading dynamics in the presence of reinforcement (T>1) is completely suppressed when the value of \u03bc exceeds certain threshold whose value decreases with T, due to the lack of match between the two types of social contacts. Note that, in Figs. 7 and 8, the boundaries of continuous transitions are longer for higher values of T, a result that is consistent with those in Fig. 1.\n\n",

At the same time, for a fixed value of \u03bc, the individuals will have more close contacts, so that more susceptible individuals can reach the critical state, leading to relatively more massive adoption within a short time and an avalanchelike outbreak through subsequent transmission.

In particular, in such cases, the number of susceptible individuals' being able to reach a critical value within a short time is not sufficient to lead to an avalanche-like outbreak. Another phenomenon is that, when the fraction of closed contacts is large and the value of T is relatively small, the threshold value is close to zero, suggesting that the outbreak of the contagion is largely driven by the hubs in the networks.

As a result, the hubs can readily enter the adopted state. For a large value of \u03bc, there is a higher probability for the contagion to be successfully transmitted among the hubs through close contacts, especially when the ordinary contacts have not been engaged in the transmission process (for small values of p). Evidence for this is presented in Figs. 13(b)\u201313(d). The hubs can then facilitate the transmission, especially for networks with weak local clustering. Note that the closed contacts capable of successfully transmitting the contagion tend to locate near the hubs, especially for the empirical network with a high positive degree-degree correlation [Fig. 11(a)]. However, this localization effect is weakened in the first-order null network model of PGP, as the hubs have more chances to connect with nonhub nodes, making a larger adopted population possible, as shown in Fig. 11(b). Nonetheless, global contagion does not arise near the outbreak threshold because of the small value of p - in this case contagion pathways of long distances from the hubs are less likely.\n",

This is due to the lack of long-time cooperation between successful reinforced and ordinary transmission, as shown in the forth columns of Figs. 14 and 15. In particular, there is still cooperation between the two types of transmission events, but it is limited to short diffusion paths (see the third columns of Figs. 14 and 15), regardless of the value of the transmission rate p.

We have accomplished that in this paper. In addition, we have developed a theoretical approach to analyzing the spreading dynamics of social contagion on random networks. Agent-based simulations and theoretical analyses have revealed the coexistence of both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions in ER random networks. Study of two empirical networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and a substantial amount of clustering has indicated that only continuous transitions can arise in such networks, and we have provided a physical understanding. Our findings are consistent with previous results from threshold models incorporating some kind of social reinforcement mechanism [13,16,40]. The physical origin of the discontinuous transition in a social system with a large number of close contacts can be attributed to their abundance through a drastic avalanche process [13,34]. A general result is that the value of the outbreak threshold is mainly determined by the abundance of the close contacts.",

            "text": "For ER networks, our study has revealed that close social contacts alone are not capable of triggering a large-scale outbreak of contagion. To have a global outbreak, a sufficient amount of ordinary transmission is needed. We have obtained a physical understanding of this phenomenon through a detailed statistical analysis of the spreading dynamics in terms of the frequencies of three different types of transmission modes, the distribution of diffusion paths of various lengths, and the frequencies of the occurrence of transmission along the diffusion paths. The analysis has revealed that, to achieve maximum spreading, a matching condition must be met: nO(t)\u2248nD(t), i.e., the number of close contacts available to susceptible individuals in the critical state must approximately match the number of ordinary contacts. There exists an optimal fraction of close contacts to maximize the spreading, which depends on the values of the transmission rate and adoption threshold. The key to making spreading prevalent lies in the interplay between ordinary and successfully reinforced transmission events associated with long diffusion paths, which cannot occur unless there is a sufficient amount of ordinary transmission. If ordinary contacts are scarce, then spreading will become stagnant. Ordinary contacts thus play a crucial role in promoting social contagion when both types of social contacts are simultaneously present. In addition, a sufficient number of close contacts can change the nature of the phase transition from continuous to discontinuous, and leads to an increase in the value of the outbreak threshold.",

While ordinary contacts still play a dominating role in the global prevalence of the contagion, there is a sensitivity to the threshold required for a successful adoption along close contacts. In particular, for a small threshold value, abundant close contacts facilitate the outbreak due to the availability of the transmission channels among the hub nodes, regardless of the value of the transmission rate. Close contacts are capable of promoting spreading but only on a local scale, especially near the hubs, making it difficult to achieve global prevalence of the contagion even though contagion outbreaks can still occur. For a large threshold value, close contacts tend to become an obstacle to transmission: global contagion will be prevented if the network is rich in close contacts, which is similar to what happens in ER networks. The lack of avalanche-like spreading, which results from inadequate number of susceptible individuals in the critical state, imposes a limit to the cooperation between ordinary and successful reinforced transmission induced by two types of contacts along long paths, leading to the absence of an optimal intermediate value \u03bc to maximize the contagion spreading.",

Second, the main goal of our present study is to develop a computational and theoretical paradigm to understand the relative roles played by ordinary and close contacts in the social contagion. For this reason, we have studied the process involving a single contagion for both static random and empirical heterogeneous networks. We hope to be able to extend our analysis of either coupled spreading scenarios [41] or contagion dynamics to more diverse complex networks, as well as to temporal networks [42], multilayer networks [43\u201347], and metapopulation systems [48].",
