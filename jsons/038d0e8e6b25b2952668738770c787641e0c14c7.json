It revealed that the S protein contained five linear immunodominant sites corresponding to the sequences of residues 9-71, 171-224, 271-318, 528-635, and 842-913 (designated as sites I to V). The immunodominant site I-III, and V reacted with more than 50% of the convalescent sera from SARS patients, and the site IV was reactive with more than 80% of SARS sera. All of 168 overlapping peptides were also used as probes to localize the immunodominant epitopes of S protein in the SARS-CoV-immunized mice and rabbits. Interestingly, only three of them (536-552, 544-560 and 603-619) reacted significantly with the mouse antisera, and all of them reside within the immunodominant site IV. Similarly, the peptide 536-552 corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the site IV reacted with all the rabbit antisera. Therefore, the major linear immunodominant domain (the site IV) induces antibody response not only in humans, but also in mice and rabbits. To investigate whether these immunodominant epitopes induced neutralizing antibodies, we designed and synthesized 5 longer peptides that overlap the immunodominant sites based on the above finding. Peptide S 19-48 and S 278-312 were derived from the immunodominant sites I and III, respectively, while the peptides S 511-552 , S 536-566 and S 603-634 overlapped with sequence of the major immunodominant site IV. All longer peptides (without conjugation to carrier) were able to elicit high titers of antibodies. However, none of rabbit antisera had neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV or SARS pesudovirus, suggesting that these linear immunodominant sites are not neutralizing epitopes.",

Strikingly, the neutralizing OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES activity of immune sera was dramatically reduced after depletion of anti-RBD antibodies, while anti-RBD antibodies in the eluates possessed higher potency than the antibodies in the flowthroughs to neutralize SARS pseudovirus, suggesting that more than 50% neutralizing activity in the antisera was contributed by the RBD-specific antibodies.",

Both mouse and rabbit antisera could efficiently block binding of RBD-Fc to ACE2. By using pseudovirus bearing the SARS-CoV S protein, we demonstrated that both mouse and rabbit antisera significantly inhibited S protein-mediated virus entry with mean 50% inhibitory titers of 1:7,393 and 1:2,060, respectively. To further elucidate neutralization determinants of the SARS-CoV, the RBD-specific antibodies were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from the rabbit antisera. Similarly, the reactivity of anti-RBD antibodies in the rabbit antisera could be efficiently depleted by RBD-Fc affinity column, as the flowthroughs did not bind to RBD-Fc while the eluted anti-RBD antibodies significantly reacted with the RBD-Fc. The neutralizing activity of anti-RBD antibody-depleted rabbit antisera was much lower than the starting sera, while anti-RBD antibodies possessed more potent activity to neutralize SARS pseudovirus.

Six groups of conformation-dependent epitopes, designated as Conf I-VI, and two adjacent linear epitopes were identified by ELISA and binding competition assays. 10 The Conf IV and V mAbs could efficiently block RBD binding to ACE2. Some mAbs reacting with the Conf III and VI partially inhibited interaction between the RBD and ACE2. This suggests that their epitopes may overlap the receptor-binding sites on the RBD or binding of these mAbs to RBD may cause conformational changes of the receptor binding sites, resulting in inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. These mAbs also had highly potent neutralizing activities against both SARS-CoV and SARS pseudovirus infections. The mAbs that recognize the Conf I, II could not significantly affect the RBD binding with ACE2, but also efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV, suggesting they may use a unique mechanism to block infection. These data indicate that the RBD induces neutralizing antibodies specific not only for the receptor-binding sites, but also for other structural conformations. Notably, two mAbs targeting linear sequences had no virus-neutralization ability. Therefore, the RBD of SARS S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes capable of inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses.",
