            "text": "A new General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) was developed. The scale underwent initial statistical validation via Exploratory Factor Analysis, which identified positive and negative subscales. Both subscales captured emotions in line with their valence. In addition, the positive subscale reflected societal and personal utility, whereas the negative subscale reflected concerns. The scale showed good psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles. These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability. Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong predictor of general attitudes as measured by the GAAIS, but perceived capability was a weaker predictor. Participants viewed AI applications involving big data (e.g. astronomy, law, pharmacology) positively, but viewed applications for tasks involving human judgement, (e.g. medical treatment, psychological counselling) negatively. Applications with a strong ethical dimension led to stronger discomfort than their rated capabilities would predict. The survey data suggested that people held mixed views of AI. The initially validated two-factor GAAIS to measure General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence is included in the Appendix.",

An important aim of our study was to develop a tool by which general attitudes toward AI could be measured in practical and research contexts, and to explore the conceptual aspects of such a tool.

Anderson, Rainie, and Luchsinger (2018) , asked 979 experts for their views on the following question \"As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?\". The respondents' collective views were mixed, identifying both benefits (e.g. enhanced effectiveness) and threats (e.g. data abuse, job losses, threats to human agency). Cave, Coughlan, and Dihan (2019) examined AI narratives produced by a representative sample of the UK population. They quantified the incidence of \"Hopes\" (e.g. AI making life easier) and \"Fears\" (e.g. AI taking over or replacing humans). They found a preponderance of negative views, in which narratives featuring dystopian expectations of AI's future impact prevailed. In contrast, Fast and Horvitz (2017) analysed news reports in the New York Times on AI over three decades, and noted increased reporting from 2009, with a general increase in optimism in the reporting, yet also with marked increases in concerns (e.g. loss of control, ethical issues, impact on work). Together, these works suggested contrasting positive and negative themes, which were held by experts, the general public, and the media alike.",

In a survey of UK attitudes towards machine learning (Royal Society Working Group, 2017) , the public perceived opportunities, but also expressed concerns regarding harm, impersonal experiences, choice restriction, and replacement. Zhang and Dafoe's (2019) survey of US citizens' attitudes towards AI, examined applications in wide use (e.g. Siri, Google), and future applications likely to impact widely on society (e.g. use of AI in privacy protection, cyber attack prevention, etc.). Their findings provided a mixture of support and concerns regarding AI. Overall, more participants (42%) supported AI than opposed it (22%), yet caution was expressed by 82%, who felt, for example, that robots should be managed carefully. Carrasco, Mills, Whybrew, and Jura's (2019) BCG Digital Government Benchmarking survey obtained similar data, with people being more accepting of AI for some applications (e.g. traffic optimisation), than for others (e.g. parole board decisions). Interestingly, Carrasco et al. suggested that AI may have been preferred to humans in countries where trust in governments may be low. Preferences for AI over humans has also been observed in different contexts, related to expertise, in a phenomenon named \"algorithm appreciation\" (Logg, Minson, & Moore, 2019) . Issues regarding employee displacement, ethics, and non-transparent decision making were among the public's concerns. Edelman (2019) identified similar themes, alongside concerns about AI exacerbating wealth inequalities, loss of intelligent behaviour in humans, increase in social isolation, and the threat of abuses of power by malevolent actors (e.g. using deep fake material to spread misinformation). Overall, recent large surveys reported a range of positive and negative attitudes towards AI, echoing the key themes of the qualitative studies.",

One perceived negative aspect of AI is potential job displacement. Frey and Osborne (2017) generated computerisability scores for 702 occupations, with many of those being highly computerisable. Chui, Manyika, and Miremadi (2016) carried out an analysis with a similar aim but a different methodology, and also identified a range of jobs at risk of automation, as did White, Lacey, and Ardanaz-Badia (2019) . Naturally, this may cause negative emotions towards AI. However, Granulo, Fuchs, and Puntoni (2019) found that, although people had negative emotions if they imagined other people's jobs being replaced by robots, they would feel less negative it if their own jobs were replaced by robots when compared to their jobs being replaced by other people. Together, these works suggest that jobs with highly predictable tasks may indeed be automated, so people's concerns for their future employment might be accurate.",

Similar divisions applied to comfortableness with personal medical information being used in AI (40% comfortable vs. 49% uncomfortable, 11% don't know). A majority was against the use of AI in tasks usually performed by medical staff, such as answering medical questions, suggesting treatments (17% for, 63% against, 20% don't know). Vayena, Blasimme, and Cohen (2018) explored what could be done in response to a majority of the UK public feeling uncomfortable with the use of AI and machine learning in medical settings. They concluded that trust in these applications needed to be promoted by data protection, freedom from bias in decision making, appropriate regulation, and transparency (see Barnes, Elliott, Wright, Scharine, & Chen, 2019; Sheridan, 2019; Schaefer, Chen, Szalma, & Hancock, 2016 for recent discussions on trust in AI in other contexts). In all, these studies illustrated comfortableness, emotional reactions, perceived capability, ethical considerations, and trust as important themes. They also showed the mixed pattern of views that emerged from the more global survey studies and qualitative studies. Altogether, many important positive and negative views of AI were identified in prior studies, and these have informed the generation of items used in our scale.",

Although instruments have been developed that measure people's acceptance of technology (e.g. Davis, 1989; Parasuraman & Colby, 2015) , most of these do not focus on AI, whose acceptance may be different in key dimensions. Technology Acceptance (Davis, 1989 ) is a construct that focuses primarily on the user's willingness to adopt technology through a consumer choice. However, frequently, consumer choice is not a factor in the application of AI, because large organisations and governments may decide to adopt AI without consulting with their end users, who therefore have no choice but to engage with it. For this reason, traditional technology acceptance measures might not be ideal to measure attitudes towards AI.",

This Index contains some elements that make it better placed to capture key aspects of AI, but it also has some elements that may be less suited. Lam et al.' s Technology Readiness Index has four subscales; Innovativeness, exemplified by a sample item \"You keep up with the latest technological developments in your areas of interest\", Optimism, e.g. \"Technology gives people more control over their daily lives\", Discomfort, e.g. \"Sometimes you think that technology systems are not designed for use by ordinary people\", and Insecurity, e.g. \"You do not consider it safe to do any kind of financial business online\". These subscales provide an interesting mixture of measures that correspond mostly to the individual user experience (Innovativeness, Discomfort), and measures that primarily capture reactions to technology being used more widely in society (Optimism, Insecurity). We used the Technology Readiness Index to test for convergent and discriminant validity with our new scale, hypothesising that there would be stronger associations of our measures with the societally-based than the individually-based subscales of the Technology Readiness Index, because AI is outside the end user's own control.",

An important aim of this part of the study was to cross-validate the general attitudes using an independent contemporary objective measure. During the formation of general attitudes, the generalisations that people arrive at may be biased by cognitive heuristics (Sloman & Lagnado, 2005) . This can be caused by overgeneralisations being based on too few instances. It can also be caused by generalisations not having been informed by specific instances, but, for example, by general media coverage. Both causes can make generalisations inaccurate. Asking individuals to make judgements about specific exemplars can help overcome this. Moreover, providing specific exemplars of a general technology is likely to facilitate the person in expressing views of that technology. This is because it may be easier to think of the implications. In addition, their views may form in less abstract and more concrete ways. In this part of the data it was not our aim to produce a scale, but to discover latent factors in the data to create composite measures for cross-validation purposes. Our reasoning was that convergence between the general and specific AI measures would strengthen confidence in the general scale. The survey data are also of more general interest as a gauge of current attitudes towards AI and its specific applications. Another important aim behind the discovery of latent factor structures in specific applications was that it would allow for important conceptual insights about any groupings in participants' perceptions.",

Our more specific aim was to test the prediction that the Technology Readiness Index subscales that reflected technology in wider society would be more predictive of attitudes towards AI than the individually-based subscales of Technology Readiness Index. To do this on a more stringent footing than by a large number of correlations, we used multiple linear regression. Using Jamovi, we entered data from our newly created General Attitudes towards AI subscales, positive and negative in turn, as the criterion (dependent) variables, and the four subscales of the Technology Readiness Index were entered as predictor (independent) variables.

All assumptions were met. Our primary interest was in discovering whether scores on our new General Attitudes towards AI subscales were significantly and uniquely predicted by scores on the technology readiness subscales. We report the F and p from ANOVAs testing the unique significant contribution for each predictor in Table 5 . These regression analyses confirmed that Technology Readiness Index measures based on individual experiences (Innovativeness, Discomfort) did not show significant unique contributions to the subscales of the General Attitudes towards AI, while the Technology measures corresponding more closely to the use of technology in society (Optimism, Insecurity) did. Our positive General Attitudes towards AI subscale was significantly predicted by a positive subscale of the Technology Readiness Index (Optimism) only, and the negative attitudes towards AI additionally by a negative subscale (Insecurity). This supports our prediction, and underlines the need for our new measure that captures the aspects of AI that older measures of technology acceptance do not capture precisely. The pattern in these data provide evidence of convergent validity as well as discriminant validity of our new scale and subscales.",

We double-checked the key patterns using the more stringent ANOVA factor contributions via linear multiple regression models. We predicted the positive and then the negative subscale of General Attitudes towards AI from the four factors related to specific applications (four-predictor model), reporting F and p for each of the coefficients in Table 9 . The strong prediction of the General Attitudes from comfortableness with specific applications provides cross-validation of the General Attitudes towards AI subscales. The four-predictor model suggested that rated capabilities of specific applications of AI were less strongly predictive of general attitudes, suggesting these were more independent. To explore the pattern in more detail, we checked whether the capability ratings predicted the positive subscale if the comfortableness ratings were eliminated from the model (a twopredictor model), and their coefficients were significant (p < .001 for Big Data, p \u00bc .002 for Human Judgement). However, perceived capability did not significantly predict negative general attitudes in an equivalent two-predictor model (p \u00bc .09 for Big Data, p \u00bc .56 for Human Judgement). Overall, the pattern provides cross-validation between the general and specific views.",

A unidimensionality assessment showed that the subscales should not be merged into an overall composite scale score. Subscales of the Technology Readiness Index that related to societal use of technology predicted our General Attitudes towards AI subscales as hypothesised. These regression patterns provided convergent validity for our new subscales. The associations were not maximal, and did not involve subscales of the Technology Readiness Index that related to individual user experiences of technology. This provided discriminant validity, which is evidence of the novelty and distinctiveness of our new scale. Our rationale for our new AI scale was that older Technology Acceptance Scales such as the TAM (Davis, 1989) reflect users' individual choices to use technology, but AI often involves decisions by others. Our results support the need for measurement tools that capture these key aspects of AI, and our new scale addresses this gap.",

It was useful that these insights emerged \"bottom-up\" from a list of AI innovations, and that clustering was likewise identified \"bottom-up\" via the statistical analysis, providing independent cross-validation. However, comfortableness was a better predictor of General Attitudes towards AI than overall perceived capability. This is probably because people may hold very positive attitudes towards the potential benefits of AI, but may nevertheless make a separate assessment about current limitations of specific AI applications. This would seem a rational position to hold given the current limitations of AI, especially given the novelty of the specific applications in our items. In contrast, people may have rated comfortableness more hypothetically, assuming that a system was fully capable of the task described. Furthermore, comfortableness is more closely related psychologically to general attitudinal constructs than capability assessments are. The latter were probably based on rational assessments, because we asked participants to judge AI vs. humans on each task. In contrast, comfortableness is likely to be more emotionally based. Overall, comfortableness with specific applications formed good cross-validation for the new General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale.",

            "text": "The study yielded important conceptual insights. One important source of insight is an inspection of items that were retained following exploratory factor analysis, how these items clustered, and which items had the strongest item-rest correlations. For the general attitudes, items that loaded onto the positive factor expressed societal or personal benefits of AI, or a preference of AI over humans in some contexts (e.g. in routine transactions), with some items capturing emotional matters (AI being exciting, impressive, making people happier, enhancing their wellbeing). Items involving personal use of AI were also present (use in own job, interest in using AI). In all, the balance in the positive items was towards utility, both in the number of items, and in the items with the highest item-rest correlations (see Table 3 ). In the negative subscale, more items were eliminated from the initial pool, and those that were retained were dominated by emotions (sinister, dangerous, discomfort, suffering for \"people like me\"), and dystopian views of the uses of AI (unethical, error prone-ness, taking control, spying). Here, the more emotional items tended to have higher item-rest correlations, suggesting that the retained negative items may reflected more affective attitudes. Some negative items were not retained in factor analysis, because they did not correlate strongly with the other item set. Two such eliminated negative items \"The rise of Artificial Intelligence poses a threat to people's job security\" and \"I am concerned about Artificial Intelligence applications mining my personal data\" showed high levels of participant concern in the survey data. However, they did not load onto the negative factor. Overall, the positive items were dominated by utility, and negative items by negative emotions and dystopian concerns.",

            "text": "Insights could also be gained from the clustering of the data on specific applications of AI. When asked about their comfortableness with these specific applications as well as their perceived capability in comparison with humans, two clusters emerged via the data analysis. In one cluster, there were applications that featured big data or other readily automatable tasks, and participants held positive views about these, feeling comfortable with them, and attributing high capabilities to such applications. Underlying this may be the common feature that these applications aided humans in their endeavours (e.g. molecule screening, aiding bankers, detecting fraud), but where humans are not replaced by AI, and AI did not gain autonomy or control. In the other cluster there were applications involving some aspect of human judgement, empathy, skill, or social understanding, and participants felt negatively towards AI performing these functions. Discomfort and low capability were, for example, associated with AI performing staff selection, decisions on the allocation of aid, and driving a car. This is an important finding, which suggests that people may make clear distinctions in the classes of tasks for which they will currently accept AI. Another important source of conceptual insights regarding specific applications is the survey data, particularly via an inspection of applications that attracted ratings near the extremes. It is interesting to note that among the lowest rated applications of AI, both for comfortableness and capability, were applications related to individual health interactions, e.g. acting as a doctor. This raises issues in the context of ongoing work developing medical AI applications (see e.g. Fenech et al., 2018; Kadvany, 2019) . Our data also showed very low ratings for applications involving psychotherapy. This is despite evidence of people's tendency to anthropomorphise and form emotional connections with extremely basic classic psychotherapy systems such as ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1976) . This is another important finding, as our data suggest that there may be initial resistance to using such applications, and their developers may need to overcome this if they want their applications to be effective.",

            "text": "Further conceptual insights were gained by correlating perceived capability and comfortableness. While these correlated strongly across applications, we argued that an ethical dimension led to a partial decoupling between comfortableness and perceived capability, which was pronounced in some items. For example, while some applications may be perceived as capable (e.g. fining people for offences based on automatic facial recognition), participants reported levels of discomfort that were out of line with the perceived capability of such applications. This may be related to the intrusiveness of these types of applications (see also House of Commons, 2019, p. 14 on automatic live facial recognition). Notwithstanding this, live facial recognition has now been introduced in London (Metropolitan Policy, 2020), with the important aim of fighting crime. More recently, facial recognition has also been deployed in Moscow for surveillance of compliance with coronavirus/Covid-19 quarantine regulations (Rainsford, 2020) . Our findings suggest the general public may not feel entirely comfortable with these types of applications in all contexts, at least not in the UK. It would be interesting and useful to examine to what extent the public may perceive the end as justifying the means in such types of applications of AI. This is likely to vary across cultures and contexts.",

            "text": "It is important to evaluate the limitations as well as the strengths of our research. First, our sample size was relatively small, for resourcerelated reasons. A reason why a small sample could be problematic is A. Schepman, P. Rodway Computers in Human Behavior Reports 1 (2020) 100014 that Exploratory Factor Analysis needs a reasonable sample size to be valid. However, the KMO MSAs for all Exploratory Factor Analyses showed good sampling adequacy. KMO MSA is an empirical measure of sampling adequacy that supersedes sample-size heuristics. These heuristics often work on a worst-case scenario, and can therefore overestimate the sample sizes needed (see e.g. Taherdoost, Sahibuddin, & Jalaliyoon, 2014, for a recent discussion). Our data also showed good internal consistency indices. Thus, we argue that our sample size was sufficient for the analyses reported. A further potential weakness is that the population from which the sample was drawn may not be sufficiently informed to express valid views on AI. Similarly, both the newspaper articles and our summaries may have oversimplified the complexities of the AI applications (Wilks, 2019) . However, it was our intention to survey ordinary people's reactions to the type of information that may reach them via general media outlets. News channels often simplify matters, while headlines condense and simplify matters even more. This condensed information was likely to reflect many people's exposure to AI developments. Finally, our scale went through initial validation using Exploratory Factor Analysis, but would benefit from further validation via a Confirmatory Factor Analysis with a new and larger sample. It would also be beneficial to run studies that link the new measure to other samples, demographics, and other social factors. This is planned as future research.",

Attitudes towards AI need to be gauged regularly, given the rapid development in these technologies and their profound impact on society. Data on acceptance of AI by the public can inform legislators and organisations developing AI applications on ways in which their introduction may need to be managed if these applications are to be accepted by the end users. Useful measurement tools are therefore important. Our new initially validated General Attitudes towards AI Scale is a useful tool to help accomplish these aims.

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO MSA) overall was 0.86, indicating amply sufficient sampling. The final model had twelve items that loaded onto factor 1, i.e. positive attitudes towards AI, and eight that loaded onto factor 2, i.e. negative views of AI. Hereby, the positivity and negativity of the items assumed during their creation was statistically supported, giving the factor structure good construct validity. In this solution the first factor accounted for 25.6% of the variance, and the second for 15.5%, cumulatively 41.6%. Model fit measures showed a RMSEA of df \u00bc 151, p \u00bc .046.
