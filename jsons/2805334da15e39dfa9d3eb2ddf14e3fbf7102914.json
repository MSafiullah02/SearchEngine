For each phase of the outbreak, specific interventions were issued and adapted accordingly. Overall, control measures were increased in intensity over time, shifting from voluntary to mandatory, and from epicenter-targeted to widely targeted (See Figure 1 for details).",

Together with ensuring the supply of daily necessities, production of medical essentials and personal protective equipment (PPE) was hastened since the first phase of the outbreak, with 10,000 test kits and 72,000 facemasks produced daily. 4 Therefore, social distancing, mass masking and other control measures have been embraced and complied by Vietnamese citizens.",
