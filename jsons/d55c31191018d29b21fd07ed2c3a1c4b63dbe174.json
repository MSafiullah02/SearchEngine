Prolonged surveillance was performed on children with ARD to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HRV in Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with ARD during 2009-2012. HRV-C was genotyped by sequencing the VP4/VP2 coding region. Among the 1,567 NPAs obtained, 223 (14.2%) were HRV positive, and 75.3% of these 223 NPAs were co-infected with other viruses. HRV-A (54.7%) and HRV-C (39.9%) accounted for the majority of HRV infections. Logistic regression models demonstrated significant associations between HRV-A, HRV-C, and asthma attacks, as well as between HRV-C and wheezing. A phylogenetic tree showed that HRV-C2 was the predominant type of HRV-C, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17. Three novel genotypes were proposed on the basis of a low identity with the known HRVs. Our results showed that HRV-A and HRV-C were the predominant types of HRV infection, and HRV-C showed a high genetic variation in Chongqing, China. HRV infection was associated with asthma attacks and wheezing; furthermore, HRV infections played a minor role in causing severe pneumonia. This knowledge provides information for the prevention and control of HRV associated with ARDs.",

Furthermore, the presence of more than 100 genetically and serologically distinct HRVs and their roles in human illnesses remain unexplored. To provide a timely estimation of HRV circulation and to acquire the exact genetic characteristics of HRVs in China, researchers should continuously monitor HRV infection by using new classification methods.",

ARD was determined on the basis of an acute disease onset with symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and a fever of more than 37.5uC. Children aged , 14 years who were admitted in respiratory clinics for ARD were recruited in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected and subjected to a laboratory analysis.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HRV-positive patients are shown in Table 1 . The age and gender distributions were comparable between groups with single infections and coinfection. Cough, expectoration, and moist rales were the main clinical manifestations. The clinical manifestations of expectoration and diarrhea were significantly overrepresented in the patients with HRV coinfections than in the patients with HRV single infections (Table 1) . Severe pneumonia was identified in 31 (13.9%) HRV-infected patients; among these patients, nine exhibited single infections. A similar frequency was obtained in the patients with co-infection.

Based on the criteria of the HRV-C subtypes presented by Simmonds et al. 30 , the 89 HRV-C samples from the study were grouped into 32 HRV-C subtypes (Figure 1 ). HRV-C2 was the predominant subtype, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17 (Figure 2 ). Six HRV-Cs demonstrated less than 90% similarities with 51 HRV gene sequences available in GenBank (Table 3, detailed in Supplementary Table S1 ). Among these six, CQ4290 (maximum identity, 77.7%), CQ3144-CQ4245 (maximum identity, 83.5%), and CQ4260 (maximum identity, 84.5%) could be designated into novel genotypes and were temporarily named HRV-Cpat52, HRV-Cpat53, and HRV-Cpat54, respectively. Another two strains (CQ5641 and CQ2026) had homo-logies close to 90% and were accordingly classified as HRV-C2 and HRV-C16, respectively.",

The highest HRV-C occurrences are observed during October in America 34 , fall and winter in Hong Kong, December and April in Gansu, China 29 , and between September and December in Spain 3 . In the current study, a biennial HRV outbreak pattern that occurred during the winter and spring seasons was identified. Chongqing is a subtropical region in China, and the identified seasonal pattern was largely similar to the pattern of influenza that has been identified in other subtropical regions in China (unpublished data). The high circulation pattern in the winter and spring may be explained by meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between meteorological parameters and HRV circulation in other regions. Different but interactive patterns of HRV-A and HRV-C circulation were identified. This temporal pattern of a high HRV-A peak followed by a low HRV-C peak could be attributed to the variation in magnitude of the susceptible popu- lation, which considerably diminished following a large outbreak of HRV-A, assuming that a cross protection exists among HRV genotypes. HRV-C causes significant febrile cough and asthmatic exacerbations in children, thereby requiring hospitalization. Previous studies have reported that HRV-C causes more severe clinical manifestations compared with the other HRV types 2, 18, 22 . However, in this current study, we only identified an association between HRV-C and an increased development of cough and asthma attacks; no correlation was observed with severe pneumonia. This discrepancy from previous studies could be attributed to the varied recruitment criteria for patients and the impact of a high frequency of co-infection. Considering that the patients in the current study were all hospitalized, they only represented a subset of HRV infections that were more severe than the average. This representation may have suppressed the association between HRV and severe diseases. Nevertheless, the significant associations in this study were inferred after excluding the effects of co-infection by multivariate logistic regression models. This approach presents an advantage over previous studies that lack multivariate analyses for the consideration of the effects from co-infection or other confounding factors 1,3 .",

Subsequently, they proposed that the equivalent system for the assignment of new HRV types can be extended to HRV-A and HRV-B 31 . In the proposed criteria, the VP4/VP2 sequences are predictive of the HRV species and type, which can be used for type identifications in epidemiological studies. Results from previous studies suggest that most or all HRV-C types circulate freely worldwide, among which HRV-C2, C6, C16, and C43 have higher prevalences than other types 31 . VP4/VP2 sequences were used to study the genetic characteristics of HRV-C, and the HRV-C2 genotype was found to be predominant in Chongqing, China. Additionally, some new sequences divergent from the VP4/VP2 sequences were identified in mainland China. Although lacking the complete gene sequences, the available VP4/VP2 sequences logically support the classification of a novel HRV-C2 lineage, confirming the high genetic diversity of HRV-C in the region. Nonetheless, further characterization of the VP1 sequences is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the novel HRV-C lineage.",
