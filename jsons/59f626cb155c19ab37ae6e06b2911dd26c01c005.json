Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by quantitative RT-PCR Q8 methods, but the capacity of quantitative RT-PCR methods is limited by their requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Herein, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, were developed and evaluated. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human coronaviruses was not observed. A colorimetric detection method was adapted for this RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput. (J Mol Diagn 2020, -: 1e7; https://doi.am EO: JMDI-D-20-00094 22.

            "text": "As the name suggests, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to a group of severe acute respiratory syndromeerelated coronaviruses, namely subgenus Sarbecovirus, showing 96% identity to a bat coronavirus. 1, 2 Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 can be done through computed tomographic scan of suspicious patients, and a confirmatory laboratory test is performed using published quantitative RT-PCR Q11 (RT-qPCR) methods 3e6 and recommendations from The World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratoryguidance, last accessed April 2, 2020). Although RT-qPCR methods are used as the gold standard for detection of pathogens because of their high sensitivity and specificity, there are still some caveats. Briefly, laboratory-level facilities, with reliable supply of electricity, expensive instruments, and trained personnel, are required to properly perform RT-qPCR tests. These restrictions hinder use of RT-qPCR methods for various point-of-care situations, where pathogen detection might be required. 7 To overcome such cost restriction of RT-qPCR and still detect pathogens' nucleic acids, isothermal amplification methods have been developed. 8 Among such methods, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has some advantages to be applied for point-of-care testing. 9 Well-optimized LAMP assay shows sensitivity comparable to that of PCR, <10 copies per reaction. 10 Intercalating fluorescent dyes are compatible with LAMP reaction so that amplification can be observed in real-time. 11 Because amplification efficiency of LAMP reaction is high, changes 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63 in reaction mixture components made it possible to detect the result with colorimetric detection methods. 12e14 Moreover, unpurified sample can be directly used for LAMP. 15e17 This indicates that high-throughput test is possible when use of unpurified specimen is combined with noninstrumental (eg, colorimetric) detection.",

Then, in vitro transcription template was prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BglI and XhoI and purification after agarose gel electrophoresis. For hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, amplicons of PCR (OC43 forward primer, 5 0 -AGCAACCAGGCTGATGTCAATACC-3 0 ; OC43 reverse primer, 5 0 -AGCAGACCTTCCTGAGCCTTCAAT-3 0 ; MERS-CoV, UpE region 19 ) were synthesized and cloned to pBIC-A plasmid (Bioneer, Daejeon, Republic of Korea). In vitro transcription template for hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV was prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BamHI-XhoI or SspI-XhoI, respectively. In vitro transcriptions were done with EZ T7 High Yield In Vitro Transcription kit (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Republic of Korea), per manufacturer's instructions. RNA products were then purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Standard RNA copy numbers were calculated from concentration measured by NanoDrop Lite (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Enzynomics.",

In summary, a pair of RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with LoD of 100 copies per reaction was designed and evaluated. These RT-LAMP assays showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 versus alphacoronavirus (hCoV-229E), betacoronavirus (hCoV-OC43), and MERS-CoV. Although specificity to SARS-CoV could not be tested because a proper sample was not in hand, specificity of the RT-LAMP assays is easily expectable from the mismatching bases in primer binding sites (Figure 1) . Especially, both of F1/B1 sites of Nsp3_1-61 primer set are in SARS-CoV-2 specific region, of which aligning SARS-CoV sequence does not exist.",

In fact, average threshold times of S_1-2-2 and N_21 primer sets for 1000 copies were faster than that of Nsp3_1-61: 7.33 (ratio of positive replicates, 2:3) and 5.06 (ratio of positive replicates, 1:3) minutes, respectively. This disrelation is previously reported. 22 One peculiar observation is that both S_1-2-2 and N_21 showed good sensitivity to cDNA template (Supplemental Figure S1 ), unlike to RNA. Observed difference of sensitivity to RNA and cDNA seems significant even when accounting for slight amplification that might happened during reverse transcription. The reason may include stochastic nature of forming proper ",

The LoD of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study, 100 copies per reaction, may not be enough for sensitive screening of suspicious patients. This relatively high LoD would be from the target sequences used for primer design that are selected by specificity versus SARS-CoV. Indeed, target GC percentage and Tm Q19 of primers had to be adjusted to get enough number of starting sets for primer screening during LAMP primer design to give less-optimal primer sets. Therefore, there might be better target sequences for LAMP assay of SARS-CoV-2 in the viewpoint of sensitivity. However, expected high specificity of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study would be a good feature for a confirmatory test. In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at early stage after symptom onset 23 suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be useable for screening tests.",

Best concentration combination was selected for each primer set by whether both of duplicates show specific amplification and by threshold time. Average threshold time (Tt_av) and corresponding dNTP and Mg 2\u00fe concentrations are as follows: dNTP (1 mmol/L) and Mg 2\u00fe (6 mmol/L) for Nsp3_1-61 (Tt_av Z 11.93), dNTP (1.4 mmol/L) and Mg 2\u00fe (8 mmol/L) for Nsp3_2-24 (Tt_av Z 7.74), dNTP (1.4 mmol/L) and Mg 2\u00fe (6 mmol/L) for S_1-2-2 and N_21 (Tt_av Z 11.08 and 5.50, respectively Q17",
