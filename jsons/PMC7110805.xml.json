Other pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuroneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Arcanobacterium pyogenes are also frequently involved (Thacker, 2006). The disease is characterised by high morbidity and low mortality and although pigs of all ages are susceptible to M. hyopneumoniae infection, EP is usually not observed in animals younger than 6 weeks of age. The prevalence of EP is particularly high in animals of mid-finishing to slaughter age and the severity of clinical signs is dictated by the strain of M. hyopneumoniae involved, infection pressure, the presence of secondary infections and by environmental conditions. When M. hyopneumoniae infection is not complicated by concomitant pathogens, the disease can take a subclinical course with mild clinical signs consisting of chronic, non-productive cough, reduced rate of average daily weight gain (ADWG) and reduced feed conversion efficiency. When secondary pathogens are involved, clinical signs include laboured breathing and pyrexia, and deaths may occur (Maes et al., 1996).",

The onset of coughing, although gradual, can be inconsistent and of variable intensity depending on the infecting dose of M. hyopneumoniae. To identify pigs with non-productive coughs, animals need to be observed over a considerable time-span and should be encouraged to move. Quantifying the number of coughing pigs in a given period of time (the \u2018coughing score\u2019) has been used in transmission (Meyns et al., 2006, Marois et al., 2007) and pathogenesis studies (Morris et al., 1995a, Vicca et al., 2003) and has also been used in the assessment of the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccines under both natural (Maes et al., 1999, Moreau et al., 2004) and experimental (Thacker et al., 2000) conditions. However, given the lack of diagnostic specificity of coughing and that subclinically affected pigs would not display it, additional diagnostic modalities are required.",

It has been estimated that the lungs of at least 30 animals should be examined to provide a reliable measure of the prevalence and severity of the pneumonia at herd level (Davies et al., 1995). Such surveillance may also be useful in detecting subclinical disease which can adversely affect production during the fattening period. However EP lesions are not pathognomonic of M. hyopneumoniae infection as other organisms such as SIV can produce similar lesions (Thacker et al., 2001).",

Similarly, the presence of additional bacterial pathogens such as A. pleuropneumoniae can cause severe pleuritis that mask EP lesions. Lesion resolution may lead to false-negative results or to an equivocal diagnosis of early mycoplasmosis (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997). The scoring systems used most frequently in EP abattoir surveillance are summarised in Table 1\n. The subjectivity involved in the visual estimation of the proportion of lung consolidated and the lack of diagnostic specificity of these lesions, limit abattoir surveillance as a diagnostic approach and, therefore, the use of additional confirmatory methods is needed.",

Detection of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae can be accomplished by ELISA and, less frequently, by complement fixation test. Antibody profiling of pig herds requires the simultaneous testing of groups of animals of different ages (transversal study) or the testing of one group of animals throughout the production cycle (longitudinal study) by ELISA. The ELISA in this context is a rapid, inexpensive and easily automated method that provides useful information on the presence of maternally-derived and acquired antibodies, as well as on the time required for animals to seroconvert. A blocking ELISA (IDEI, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae EIA kit, Oxoid) and two indirect ELISA tests (HerdCheck, IDEXX and Tween 20-ELISA) are the most frequently used serological tests to detect antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. Comparative studies have reported differing specificities and sensitivities between these kits (Pijoan, 1994, Strait et al., 2004, Ameri-Mahabadi et al., 2005, Erlandson, 2005). When discrepancies in serological test results are identified, a Western blot immunoassay (WBI) targeting different M. hyopneumoniae antigens can be used as a confirmatory test (Ameri et al., 2006). The utility of antibody profiling can be hindered by: variation in ELISA results depending on the test used (Ameri-Mahabadi et al., 2005, Erlandson, 2005); the inability of serology to differentiate natural infection from vaccination; lack of correlation between different measures of antibody titre; variations in the detection of antibodies to different strains of M. hyopneumoniae (Strait et al., 2004); significant variability in the time taken by animals to seroconvert.",

Although antibodies were detected 2\u20134 weeks after intratracheal infection of pigs with M. hyopneumoniae (Sheldrake et al., 1990, Kobisch et al., 1993). S\u00f8rensen et al. (1997) reported seroconversion as early as 8 days post-infection (PI) in a proportion of pigs infected by aerosol, although the remaining animals required five further weeks to seroconvert. Under natural conditions, Morris et al. (1995b) detected seroconversion in a herd 3 weeks after contact exposure, with titres peaking around 11 weeks after exposure. In two other studies carried out under field conditions, seroconversion occurred mainly in grower-finishing units (8\u201324 weeks of age), between 6 and 9 weeks PI (Andreasen et al., 2000, Leon et al., 2001). The delay in seroconversion associated with infection with this pathogen may partly be due to the fact that M. hyopneumoniae attaches to the ciliated respiratory epithelium and does not invade the pulmonary tissue to the same extent as other pathogens. This may result in slower presentation of mycoplasma antigens to the host. Of further note is the fact that there is no correlation between antibody titres and protection against the infection (Maes et al., 1996).",

Direct (Kobisch et al., 1978) and indirect IFAs (Piffer and Ross, 1985) have been used to localise M. hyopneumoniae antigen in porcine lungs. The IFA has also been compared with PCR as a diagnostic technique in pathogenesis and transmission studies (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997, Vicca et al., 2003, Meyns et al., 2006). A positive IFA test is associated with the more acute stage of EP when the mycoplasmal load is high, in contrast with the low sensitivity of this assay in more chronic disease when lower numbers of mycoplasma organisms are likely to be present (Ross, 1999). A further limitation of the IFA is that in the frozen tissue sections used, artefactual tissue fragmentation may obscure morphological features.",

These PCR methods are more rapid than bacteriological culture and are relatively inexpensive to perform (Calsamiglia et al., 1999a). However the confounding significance of sample contamination is much higher with PCR. Given that M. hyopneumoniae DNA from both live and dead organisms is amplified, the identification of PCR positive animals raises the question of whether such pigs have active infection or not. Since M. hyopneumoniae attaches to the ciliated epithelium of the airways, the best samples to detect M. hyopneumoniae by PCR are tracheo-bronchial swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Tracheo-bronchial swabs and BALF are equally predictive of infection in both live (Marois et al., 2007) and dead (Kurth et al., 2002) experimentally infected pigs. The use of PCR to detect M. hyopneumoniae in lung tissue has produced variable results. Moorkamp et al. (2008) suggested that lung samples are more appropriate than BALF in cases of moderate to severe EP, whereas Kurth et al. (2002) found lung tissue unreliable in this context.",

Although the potential use of nasal swabs for nested PCR (nPCR) testing for M. hyopneumoniae in live pigs has been demonstrated (Sibila et al., 2007b), the procedure is currently considered more useful for the monitoring of infection at a herd rather than at an individual animal level (Otagiri et al., 2005).",

Airborne particles containing the microorganism are generated by sneezing and coughing, and are also exhaled by infected pigs (St\u00e4rk, 1999). Goodwin (1985) suggested that aerosol transmission between farms may occur and that the risk of a herd becoming infected with M. hyopneumoniae was inversely related to the proximity of other pig farms. Zhuang et al. (2002) found that a pig herd\u2019s risk of becoming infected was closely associated with pig density in the area and with the distance to neighbouring farms. The minimum distance between pig farms to theoretically avoid airborne transmission has been calculated to be at least 3 km. In Denmark, Thomsen et al. (1992) proposed airborne transmission as a major source of M. hyopneumoniae infection in mycoplasma-free SPF pig herds and indicated that the risk of these herds becoming infected was greater when neighbouring infected herds were larger.",

To evaluate and quantify the transmission of M. hyopneumoniae to nursery pigs under standardised experimental conditions, Meyns et al. (2004) used an adjusted reproduction ratio (R\nn). This R\nn value expressed the mean number of secondary infections caused by one infectious piglet during a nursery period of 6 weeks where the virulence of the isolate was taken into account (Vicca et al., 2003). The R\nn values for the high and low virulent isolates were 1.47 and 0.85, respectively, although this difference was not statistically significant. These results imply that one piglet infected before weaning is able to infect one to four pen mates during the nursery period. Under the experimental conditions of this study (Meyns et al., 2004), the spread of M. hyopneumoniae between animals was slow. Other experimental studies have demonstrated transmission of M. hyopneumoniae between pen mates by 7 (Marois et al., 2007) and 28 (Fano et al., 2005b) days PI. Fano et al. (2005a) reported directly and indirectly in-contact animals seroconverting 5 and 6 weeks later than experimentally inoculated pigs.",

Under field conditions, there is a progressive decrease in the numbers of pigs with maternal antibodies followed by a slow increase in the numbers of seropositive animals towards the finishing stage of production (Calsamiglia et al., 1999b). Although the median half-life of maternal antibody against M. hyopneumoniae is approximately 16 days (Morris et al., 1994), they may persist for 9 weeks when initial titres are high (Wallgren et al., 1998). Persistence of maternal antibody to M. hyopneumoniae in piglets is also dictated by the level of antibody in the sow\u2019s serum (Wallgren et al., 1998). Within a variable time-span after maternal antibodies wane, pigs seroconvert to M. hyopneumoniae (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997, Vigre et al., 2004) although the waning of maternal antibodies may not be as significant in M. hyopneumoniae-vaccinated herds (Sibila et al., 2004b). The fact that the number of seropositive animals gradually increases towards the end of the fattening period in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds suggests that antibodies induced by either natural infection or vaccination do not prevent further infection (Maes et al., 1998, Maes et al., 1999).",

Sow vaccination can control EP by transferring colostral-derived immunity to the piglets and thus reducing vertical transmission (Sibila et al., 2007a).
