Starting with T cell epitope discovery, we illustrate how T cell epitopes are relevant to vaccine safety, efficacy, antigen characterization, antigen engineering, and vaccine design. We believe that T cell epitopes deserve greater focus in vaccine development, because even in the absence of effective antibody response, T cell epitopes are important drivers of immune defense against pathogens and may also facilitate their escape from immune defense. Specifically, new information on cross-conservation between pathogen T cell epitopes and the human genome (and microbiome) is emerging, and has important implications for vaccine design. For example, \u201cmemory\u201d of cross-conserved T cell epitopes has been defined as a key contributor to the strength of protection generated by vaccines (2\u20134). These discoveries are coming to light through the application of new tools that examine T cell epitopes and their role in vaccines, using the power of immunoinformatics.",

Beginning in 2013, we observed that the TCR face of epitopes presented by some pathogens contains patterns of amino acids that are identical to T cell epitopes that bind to the same HLA alleles and are highly prevalent in the human proteome (5, 6). We hypothesized that the role of these \u201chuman-like\u201d T cell epitopes may be to tolerize against a pathogen, by activating self-reactive Tregs that suppress immune response (7). We also observed that immune camouflage is more likely to be present in pathogens that have the capacity to modify antigens (8, 9). We have generated evidence that this concept is also relevant to cancer vaccines and could improve the safety and efficacy of such vaccines (10).",

Furthermore, we used a tool called OptiMatrix to design immune-engineered vaccines that enhance immunogenicity by removing human-like epitopes (11). In other iVAX toolkit advances, to be described here, we explored the HLA-restricted or \u201cpersonal\u201d nature of immune response to novel antigens and developed specific tools to address these types of evaluations, called iTEM (individualized T cell epitope measure) and EpiCC (epitope content comparison), respectively.

Newer tools include the VaxCAD algorithm (16) that creates string-of-beads vaccine designs while minimizing deleterious junctional epitopes that may be created in the process of linking one epitope to another. Additional tools that have been integrated into the website since 2015 include JanusMatrix, a specially tailored homology analysis tool that examines pathogen/host sequence similarity at the MHC:TCR interface for any given peptide, and predicts potentially cross-conserved epitopes, allowing candidate sequences with potential host cross-conservation (at the TCR face) to be preferentially excluded from vaccine constructs, and iTEM, which enables the analysis of an individual's immune responses to vaccine antigens according to their HLA haplotype. The latter two tools have also been integrated into a separate pipeline for personalized cancer vaccine design called Ancer, that has been licensed to EpiVax Oncology, an investor-backed spin out of EpiVax.",

Working with Amy Noe and Vinayaka Kotraiah at Leidos, we used iVAX to predict and analyze HLA class II-restricted epitopes that would drive humoral immune responses through cognate T cell help, providing broad population coverage for a novel P. falciparum CSP protein (PfCSP) vaccine (61). In the course of a USAID-funded program, more than 450 PfCSP epitope sequence variants were analyzed and the optimal sequences (with highest cross-strain coverage) were selected for the next stage of vaccine development. We also noted high interstrain variability in CSP T helper epitopes and a tendency for the more highly conserved CSP epitopes to be more cross-conserved with the human genome (62).",

EpiVax Oncology will use Ancer to develop individualized cancer vaccine by screening each cancer mutanome to identify tumor-specific neo-epitopes using EpiMatrix, filter out neo-epitopes that may be tolerogenic using JanusMatrix, and rank the remaining neoantigens according to their optimal immunogenic profile. While the number of companies that are developing tools for identifying neo-epitopes is rapidly expanding, having access to high throughput, commercial-grade and validated tools that incorporate consideration of the rules of self-tolerance will be critically important for the design of more effective and safer vaccines for cancer immunotherapy.",
