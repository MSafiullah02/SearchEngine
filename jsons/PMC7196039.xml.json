The population infection rate was determined at the start of each simulation run, with the age distribution matching the reported age distribution of COVID-19 cases, and each infected person then moving through a probability tree of differing possible sequential clinical outcomes. Model input parameters were obtained from scientific literature or nationally representative data sources. Costs were reported in 2020 US dollar values, with a 3% discount rate applied.",

In contrast, 50% and 20% infection rates were estimated to cause 134.4 million and 53.8 million symptomatic cases, respectively, resulting in median direct medical costs during the course of the infection of $408.8 billion and $163.4 billion, respectively, which increased to $536.7 billion and $214.5 billion, respectively, with inclusion of 1-year post-discharge costs.",
