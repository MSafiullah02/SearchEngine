Parvovirus-like particles expressing the major structural protein VP2 in insect cells are very stable and highly immunogenic (Lopez de Turiso et al., 1992, Martinez et al., 1992). Moreover, canine parvovirus (CPV) does not cause disease in human, therefore parvovirus-like particles is a safe expression platform. Parvovirus VLP has been successfully used for the expression of foreign antigens and induction of robust B-, T-cell responses (Miyamura et al., 1994, Casal et al., 1999, Lo-Man et al., 1998, Xu et al., 2014, Rueda et al., 1999).",

In the present study, we demonstrated that the recombinant CPV VP2 linked to MERS RBD results in self-assembly into sVLP which display the RBD on the surface, and showed that this vaccine candidate is able to induce robust B- and T-cell responses in mice.",

            "text": "Both specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity is essential for effective vaccination against many pathogens (Slifka and Amanna, 2014). In our study, mice that received sVLP produced a Th1-biased response with high levels of IL-2 secretion, whereas mice immunized with sVLP + poly(I:C) produced substantial IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-4 responses, representing mixed Th1 and Th2 responses. In contrast, mice that received sVLP + Alum did not result in a detectable cellular immune response, likely because Alum is known to be a poor cellular immune response inducer (Maughan et al., 2015). In contrast, poly(I:C) is a double-stranded RNA polymer that acts as a molecular mimic of viral infection and is recognized by Toll-like receptor 3, resulting in expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and Th1- and Th2- related cytokines (Ichinohe et al., 2005). Furthermore, poly(I:C) has been used in many clinical trials with good results (Okada et al., 2011, Rahimian et al., 2015). The percentage of CD11c and CD86, CD11c and CD80 double-positive cells was notably increased in mice received regimes containing sVLP, which suggested that sVLP could efficiently recruit or activate DCs in lymph nodes, which is important for effective stimulation of the innate immune response and as a link to the adaptive immune response (Grgacic and Anderson, 2006). In addition to CD11c+ and CD80+, CD11c+ and CD86+ were highest in mice injected with poly(I:C) adjuvanted sVLP, the IgG levels was highest in the poly(I:C) adjuvanted group. In summary, poly(I:C) adjuvanted sVLP is a promising vaccine regimens for the next stage of pre-clinical testing in larger animal models, and the dosage, route of administration and intervals of immunization will need to be further evaluated and optimized to maximize chances of a successful vaccination.",
