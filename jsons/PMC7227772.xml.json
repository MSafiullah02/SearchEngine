I remember many a meeting inside the Beltway in which various individuals, from academia to government to the private sector, stressed how being prepared for both human-made and natural events is a more apt application of the term \u201cdual use.\u201d",

Many of our laboratories have paused research, and those who are performing essential research, including on COVID-19, are having to operate under different safety regulations to maintain social distancing. We are working from home, often with children to care for at the same time. Some of us or our family members have had to take pay cuts, been furloughed, or even been laid off. The scientific enterprise is stressful even in the best of times. When you encounter someone who is struggling, show empathy and understanding.",

They are worried about how this is going to affect their careers moving forward. When will they defend their dissertations? Will people hold apparent gaps in their productivity against them? The latter question is also being asked by junior faculty when thinking about promotion and tenure and even by more senior scientists as they consider grant renewals. When you encounter someone with these kinds of doubts, take the time to counsel them and talk them through their situation.",

I am not going to try to list them here: all one needs to do is browse social media and the Internet more broadly for examples every day. Our daily research routines have been disrupted, but we can remain engaged. Many of you might be thinking that what life has thrown us this time is more challenging than a Mariano Rivera cut fastball. (Yes, I am a lifelong Yankees fan.) With all due respect to Mariano, we can hit this one!",

My lab is about 100 meters from our department office, to and from which I walk multiple times each day, and I am often travelling between buildings on campus. Working from home has certainly changed that. Make a conscious effort to get outside. Walk, bike, run, do whatever you can that can be accomplished with appropriate social distancing. Your physical and mental health depend on it.",

People, especially in leadership positions, are being asked to make many decisions in a compressed time frame. What better time to use the collective mind to inform how we operate? Many of you have been thinking, or are beginning to think, about how to restart your laboratory activities. Engage all members of the group in devising a means to operate that is safe while still allowing projects to resume. Reach out to your colleagues, locally and at other institutions, for ideas.",

To paraphrase Tony Fauci, the virus will decide when we can move back to the way we are used to. Let us not rush the process of returning to normal. There are lessons to be learned from the 1918 influenza pandemic, during which communities that were cautious in returning to normal suffered less in the long run, in terms of both physical and economic health.",
