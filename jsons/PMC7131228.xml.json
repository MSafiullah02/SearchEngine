The need for a group to advise WHO specifically on vaccine product development was highlighted, to accelerate vaccine availability and ensure accessibility of vaccines to low and middle income countries (LMICs). PDVAC's remit is to advise on the product development strategy of vaccine candidates at phase II of clinical evaluation or earlier, and to report its proceedings to the WHO's principal committee on immunization policy recommendations: the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). The PDVAC committee has a critical role in assessing the evolving vaccine development landscape and in helping to define where and how WHO can be most impactful, according to three criteria:\u2022Unmet public health need for a vaccine, focusing on the LMIC perspective,\u2022Likelihood of a product emerging from the pipeline, as defined by probability of technical and regulatory success, and the extent of awareness, activity and investment in a given area,\u2022A clear role for WHO with perceived added value for engagement in the pathogen area.\n",

PPCs define WHO preferences for the properties of vaccines to be used in LMICs that are 5\u201310 years from licensure, and inform target product profiles in use by manufacturers and funders for vaccines. PDVAC also encourages developers to be aware of the process and requirements for WHO prequalification (PQ). WHO Prequalification is a service to UNICEF and other UN agencies that purchase vaccines once they have been licensed, to determine the acceptability, in principle, of vaccines from different sources for supply to these agencies. It aims to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and immunization-related equipment and devices for high burden diseases meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and are appropriate for use in LMICs contexts in order to optimize the potential benefit of these interventions [1].",

The report highlights the urgent need to reduce reliance on currently available antimicrobials, without which today's 700,000 deaths per year from drug resistant microbes is forecasted to increase to 10 million, by 2050. The cost in terms of lost global production due to infections that are not controllable due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is estimated to be $100 trillion by 2050 if no action is taken [2]. The development of vaccines against pathogens that are currently controlled by antimicrobials has become an imperative, as they have the potential to reduce the prevalence and spread of drug resistance, as well as to reduce the use of antimicrobials more broadly [3].",

Approximately 480,000 cases/annum are multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) and some strains are untreatable. In 2014, six million new cases of Mtb were reported to WHO, fewer than two-thirds (63%) of the 9.6 million people estimated to have contracted the disease. This means that 37% of new cases were not detected or reported. A vaccine is imperative to achieving the End TB goals [12], particularly through reaching the population who are undiagnosed and continue to transmit disease. As such, the TB vaccine development community has turned its focus to the development of vaccines targeted to adolescents and adults as the age-groups with highest burden of active disease and the source of Mtb transmission. Modelling studies suggest that prevention of pulmonary disease in this population from primary infection and from reinfection or reactivation of existing infections is the most effective strategy to prevent Mtb infection and disease in infants and children [13]. The most advanced vaccine candidates are targeting this indication, including current neonatal BCG replacement candidate vaccines that are also undergoing evaluation as a booster in later life. Several of these candidates are in proof-of-concept clinical studies and are approaching key endpoints through prevention of infection or disease, or prevention of disease due to reinfection in this these target populations in the next 12\u201324 months [14]. With this in mind, PDVAC recommended that WHO prioritize and facilitate consensus building with respect to the development of strategic goal(s) and PPC(s) for vaccines targeted to adolescents and adults, in the first instance. There are several candidates and platforms in the pipeline that target this goal in this population, as well as other important target populations [4]. PDVAC acknowledged the significant need for development for these vaccines in parallel, as well as continued efforts to understand the biological mechanism of disease to support the immunological rationalization of candidates.",

The interim data from a phase I/II study (HVTN 100) met its humoral and cellular immunological \u2018go\u2019 criteria, exceeding the RV144 responses against sub-Saharan clade C antigens. Extrapolation of these responses to those observed with RV144, suggest that the optimised vaccine could offer at least 50% protection following a 12 month booster. Based on these data, a randomised placebo controlled phase IIb/III efficacy trial (HVTN702) enrolling 5400 subjects was initiated in late 2016 in South Africa, and will evaluate ALVAC (clade C) prime/bivalent recombinant gp120 protein with MF59 adjuvant as a heterologous boost, as well as the effect of a booster at 12 months [16]. Futility analyses will be undertaken early in the 2 year follow-up period. Correlate of protection studies and assessment of cross-reactivity to other regional clades are included in the study design. Discussions with the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC) are ongoing, and licensure in South Africa could be as early as 2021.",

In consideration of this, and with WHO support, a systematic review/meta-analysis of HSV-2 and risk of HIV acquisition including 54 studies will inform modelling of the potential impact of an HSV-2 vaccine on HIV incidence, and is expected to be published in late 2016. A review of biological mechanisms of HSV-HIV interaction and implications for vaccine development has also been drafted. The pipeline for therapeutic vaccines remains robust, with 5 candidates in clinical development, the most advanced of which now has data demonstrating significant reductions in HSV2 shedding (55%) and days with genital lesions (60%) over 12 months [46]. In response to these positive data, NIAID has formed an HSV working group to propose desired characteristics for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for HSV, including indication, priority target populations, clinical trial endpoints, and safety and efficacy criteria. This document could form the foundation for a WHO consultative process to generate a guidance document on Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC). PDVAC encouraged WHO to actively collaborate and support development of PPCs for HSV vaccines.",

Improved global burden of disease data and vaccine impact modelling on long term sequelae are also needed to define the investment case for these vaccines.

At the time of responding to the EVD emergency, the availability of well-characterised pre-clinical models and robust data was essential for the comparative evaluation and selection of candidates to move into clinical studies. Novel recombinant viral vector platforms, in combination with recombination proteins have been validated by EVD experience and it could be argued are now less risky for development of vaccine against future pathogens, but manufacturing feasibility and scale-up capabilities still need to be confirmed for the most novel platforms.

The remit of WHO\u2019s Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (IPAC) is to provide strategic advice on immunization practices, tools, and technologies intended to improve the delivery of immunization programs at the country level. It oversees the recently formed delivery technologies working group (DTWG) composed of public health organizations, funders and procurement agencies as well as vaccine developers to evaluate R&D in novel delivery technologies and devices, for example the microarray patch, and compact, pre-filled auto-disable injection technologies (cPAD). Of particular focus for this group is the development and evaluation of a framework to analyze high-level trade-offs between important variables such as development, procurement and supply chain costs, coverage, efficacy, and safety in order to facilitate investment decisions by product developers, vaccine manufacturers, global policy makers, in-country decision makers and procurement agencies. This framework is referred to as total systems effectiveness (TSE). The intent of this delivery technology working group is to offer a platform for discussion and guidance regarding vaccine preferences for LMICs, early on in development, so that ultimately the vaccine is suitable for programmatic use. The DTWG reports directly to IPAC, but has potential overlap with activities that are overseen by PDVAC, particularly in consideration of second generation vaccines or new vaccines that may be developed with an alternative presentation to that of a needle and syringe.",
