Therefore, the health status of the public in one country is not only determined by the political, economic, and cultural development of the land but also affected by the health and safety status of other countries in the world [1]. Due to the globalization, complexity, and diversification of health influence factors, the development of global health requires all-round cooperation from all countries in the world. Global health, in a broad context, refers to improving public health worldwide, reducing disparities, and protecting against global threats that do not consider national borders [2].",

Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19), the number of people infected with the virus worldwide has reached more than 2.1 million, causing more than 145,000 deaths, and the epidemic has spread to 211 countries (as of 15 April 2020) [4]. The new coronavirus epidemic has brought tremendous harm and threat to the health of the global public and also exposed many problems in global health governance [5]. In this context, the global experts and scholars\u2019 attention to global health likely will further increase. To promote the deepening of research in global health, it is particularly essential to comprehensively summarize and review the current research results in the field of global health. Gostin et al. introduced the development history, framework, and deficiencies of global health law, and sought to establish domestic and global links in the field of health law [6]. Dieleman et al. examined the status and characteristics of fiscal health expenditures in 195 countries/regions and predicted the future development trend of global health spending [7]. Garc\u00eda et al. revealed the severity and causes of corruption in the global health system, noting that policymakers, research scholars, and funders need to clarify their responsibilities and treat corruption as an essential area of research [8]. Herath et al. combed the research literature of interprofessional education in global health care and analyzed the main differences and features of global health education for undergraduates and postgraduates in developed and developing countries [9]. Other scholars have reviewed different aspects of global health, such as experience and progress in the prevention and control of infectious diseases [10], lessons learned and theoretical basis for the implementation of global health security [11], and mechanisms for international institutions to participate in global health governance [12]. Most of the existing studies started from a single perspective or focused on a specific research area of global health, which lacks a comprehensive and systematic review of global health research.",

In the past, the number of research literature on global health has multiplied [14,15]. Because global health research involves multiple disciplines and scattered research themes, it has brought a lot of difficulties for global health researchers to grasp this emerging research area and find research hotspots. Due to the development of technologies such as data mining, information analysis, and graphic drawing, the organic combination of computer technology and traditional mathematical statistics has made it possible for visual analysis of scientific metrology. Scientometrics can intuitively show the information panorama of each discipline through the knowledge map, and explore research hotspots and emerging trends in a particular field [16]. It is widely used in the areas of environmental ecology [17], public health [18,19], business economics, artificial intelligence [20], education research, resource science [21], and medicine.",

Each of these databases has advantages and disadvantages. Google Scholar has a broad coverage of literature data and plentiful literature types, but it has low data quality and many duplicate data [22]. PubMed is a free biomedical information retrieval system developed by the NCBI. PubMed has a rich literature in the medical field but lacks literature data in other subject areas. Scopus and Web of Science are comprehensive databases, and there is not much difference in data coverage between the two. However, some scholars have shown that when using CiteSpace software for visual analysis, the knowledge map made by the literature of the Web of Science database is better [23,24]. Therefore, this study uses the Web of Science to retrieve the literature data needed for analysis. To ensure the reliability of the scientific metrological analysis, we chose the Web of Science core collection, and the indexes are SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CCR-EXPANDED, and Index Chemicus. The detailed retrieval strategy is shown in Figure 1. After preliminary searching, 14,692 pieces of literature data were obtained. For some reason, there are differences and ambiguities in the expressions of author names, institution names, and country names in literature data. In response to this, before conducting scientific measurement analysis, we used CiteSpace\u2019s data deduplication and name merge functions to standardize the data. The literature search date is December 30 December 2019.",

This article uses CiteSpace software to visualize the structure, regularity, and distribution of knowledge in the global health field, and analyze the co-citation of documents to mine the knowledge clustering and distribution of citation space. At the same time, we also performed co-occurrence analysis between other knowledge units in the global health field, such as cooperation between authors, institutions, and countries. Finally, we built a comprehensive knowledge map of global health research based on the results of scientific econometric analysis. Figure 1 shows the research framework of the article.",

The knowledge map shows the distance of time with warm and cold colors. When the time is closer to 2019, the colors become warmer. In the knowledge graph, the size of the nodes means the frequency of the authors, institutions, countries, and journals, and the connection between the nodes indicates that these nodes appear in the same article [27]. In general, when two or more authors (institutions, countries) appear in the same paper, it can be regarded as a scientific research cooperation relationship between these authors (institutions, countries) [28]. In the process of scientometric analysis, there are also some parameter indicators for a specific evaluation. H-index is a mixed quantitative index proposed by physicist George Hirsch of the University of California, USA, which is used to evaluate the amount of academic output and the level of the scholarly output of researchers and institutions. H-index indicates that h of the N papers published in the journal have been cited at least h times [29]. The Degree in the table indicates the number of connections between authors (institutions, countries) in the co-occurrence knowledge graph. A higher Degree value indicates more communication and cooperation between the authors (institutions, countries). Besides, intermediary centrality is an indicator that measures the importance of nodes in the research cooperation network, and the half-life is a parameter that represents the continuity of institutional research from a time perspective [25].",

Therefore, this article uses CiteSpace to analyze the quote of the journals, and produced a map of the cited journals, as shown in Figure 3. Based on the frequency of citations, we selectively counted the detailed information of the top 20 journals and drew Table 1. As can be seen in Figure 3 and Table 1, after careful consideration of citation frequency, impact factor, centrality, and H-index, the top five core journals are LANCET (IF: 59.10, H-index: 700), NEW ENGL J MED (IF: 70.67, H-index: 933), JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC (IF: 51.27, H-index: 622), SCIENCE (IF: 41.03, H-index: 1058) and NATURE (IF: 43.07, H-index: 1096). In Figure 3, the nodes of LANCET, NEW ENGL J MED, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, SCIENCE, NATURE, and P NATL ACAD SCI USA have relatively large node circles, and there are cool-tone areas in the node circles. However, node circles such as PLOS ONE, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, LANCET INFECT DIS, and LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH are mostly warm colors. It shows that the critical early literature on global health research mainly came from the journals of LANCET, NEW ENGL J MED, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, SCIENCE, NATURE, and P NATL ACAD SCI USA. It is worth noting that the top five journals in the global health field are from the United States (NEW ENGL J MED, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, SCIENCE ) and the United Kingdom(LANCET, NATURE).",

Therefore, in the fields of scientific text mining and scientometrics, the co-occurrence analysis of keywords can quickly grasp the development trends and research topics of a specific research field [49]. From the results of keyword co-occurrence analysis, there are five main research topics in the global health field, including global health goals and directions, research on global health risk factors, research on specific groups and specific countries or regions, and research on cooperative communication mechanisms. The goal of global health is to improve the equity of global health and the quality of life of people worldwide [50]. The original intention of the rise of global health is based on its effective way of dealing with global health inequity, which provides a new perspective and approach for achieving the goal of global health equity [51]. Global health focuses on the fairness and health influencing factors of global health, not just the health status and influencing factors of people in a specific country or region. Global health also pays attention to the global distribution of health and disease and its determinants, attaches importance to the impact of globalization on health and changes in the nature of global health governance, and emphasizes interdependence and coping strategies that transcend national and policy sector boundaries [52,53].",

Global health governance is a tool for dealing with the determinants of a healthy society across sectors [54]. The theoretical research and practical aspects of global health reflect that poor governance at the national and international levels will undermine the achievement of global health goals [55]. The catalyst for global health implementation is global health diplomacy. An important change in the 2000 G-8 summit was the linking of foreign policy with global health issues, and global health began to become a major goal and strategy of foreign policy. Global health diplomacy promotes the participation of various actors in the global governance actions taken to solve global health and related issues [56]. Some sovereign countries have established bilateral or multilateral global health strategies with other countries or organizations through mechanisms such as foreign policy and negotiation and consultation, formulated global health plans, and provided relevant financial and technical assistance to low- and middle-income countries [57].",

            "text": "In this study, based on the 14,692 literature data on global health research retrieved from the WOS core collection from 1996 to 2019, we conducted a scientometric analysis of the knowledge structure and knowledge field of global health research. At the same time, a visual analysis of the knowledge unit in the global health field was conducted, and a comprehensive knowledge map was drawn. Research in the global health field is extensive, involving multidisciplinary theories and methods, and its development requires the participation of researchers and new scholars in various fields. Scientific research cooperation between developed and developing countries in the global health field is particularly important and needs to be further strengthened. The mechanism of global health governance, the prevention and control of various infectious diseases, and the cultivation of professionals require long-term attention and discussion. This study provides researchers with an overview of global health through a systematic and comprehensive analysis of scientific output, core authors, significant institutions and countries, high impact journals, research cooperation networks, research topics, and emerging trends in the field of global health research. By presenting a new, comprehensive, and holistic knowledge map, this research contributes to the existing global health knowledge system. It also provides valuable guidance for researchers and related personnel to find the research direction and practice of global health.",
