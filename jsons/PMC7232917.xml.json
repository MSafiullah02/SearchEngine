It consists of two virus subfamilies (Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae) including five genera and around 40 virus species [1]. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae that contains human coronaviruses consists of four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Coronaviruses (CoV) affect various organs and tissues and act as pathogens causing a broad range of diseases including severe human respiratory infection called atypical pneumonia. Usually, viruses of this family induce acute infection manifested by signs of inflammation featured with properties of cytokine storm syndrome [2, 3].",

This strain turned out to be close to bat SARS-like coronavirus as well as those inducing SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which caused in 2003 and 2012, severe pneumonia outbreaks in humans, referred as atypical pneumonia. Such infections did not induce a wide pandemic spread but showed a threatening pattern due to high mortality rate reaching up to 9.6-35.5% [2, 36]. Hence, the threat of the emerging coronavirus pandemic corroborates the need to develop high-efficacy pharmaceuticals against coronaviruses, refining principles for using available antivirals and development of pathogenetic approaches to the treatment of disease.",

By now, there are diverse multi-specific RNA polymerase inhibitors acting on various viruses due to marked structural and functional similarities of this enzyme existing among different viruses [37]. Ribavirin (furanosyl carboxamide) is among inhibitors of this type because it exhibits high activity against diverse viruses [10] (including coronaviruses) at concentration of 10-25 nM (IC50), with selectivity index of more than 100 [10-12]. Because SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) mainly develop in the respiratory tract cells, ribavirin aerosol inhalations that could create effective antiviral activity at non-toxic concentrations in the airway epithelial layer and thus might serve as the most appropriate drug formulation. This is based on low pulmonary bioavailability shown for oral vs. aerosol ribavirin (1% and more than 70%, respectively) and its subsequent activation via a phosphorylation reaction occurring in the respiratory epithelium [12]. Of note, direct aerosol-delivered action on respiratory epithelium might be most active and efficient at an early stage after the onset of infection, which is accompanied by virus replication at eclipse phase when pathological events of inflammation and edema would have not reached a dangerous level.",

It turned out that cleavage of the polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) is mediated by its own domain 5 (nsp 5) (called protease domain Mpro) exerting specificity of the target proteolytic sites close to picornavirus and HIV proteases [38] and being sensitive to the binary protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (\u201cKaletra\u201d) [6-9]. In some viruses, two initial breaks within the polyprotein 1ab are performed by protein nsp3 (PLpro), also bearing cysteine protease papain-like domain [35]. Lopinavir/ritonavir simulating proteolytic target sites in viral proteins exhibited pronounced therapeutic effect during SARS and MERS, displaying IC50 at the level of 5-20 nM [6, 9]. Structural similarity in protease domain nsp5 from CoVs causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS allows it to be unequivocally recommend it for treatment of atypical pneumonia during COVID-19 [7, 9]. Use of this drug might be specifically efficient at the initial phase of CoV replication during an early stage of infection.",

While choosing a treatment strategy, it should be taken into consideration that interferon preparations may exhibit peak efficacy solely at early disease stages, when host reaction has not yet been augmented too much or culminated [2, 47, 48]. Moreover, use of exogenous interferon-based preparations would hardly be rational at later disease stages due to the high quantity of endogenous interferons produced in response to acute coronavirus infection. Finally, inoculation of exogenous interferon-based preparations at late stages of infection by further elevating pre-set high level of endogenous interferons could promote cytokine storm syndrome and inflammation at the site of infection, thereby deteriorating the disease course [3, 48].",

The early (etiotropic) phase dominated by virus replication is called the exponential phase of virus propagation and accumulation (day 7-10 from the onset of viral infection). It is characterized by emergence of developing virus-specific defense reaction to infected host cells (production of immunoglobulins, antigen-specific T and B cell clones, and interferons) and general inflammatory response due to cytokines and chemokines synthesized at the site of infection. Later, growth of the virus declines and this results in developing a pathogenetic phase associated with formation of pathologic mechanisms critically affecting disease outcome as well as posing a threat of potential complications. Among the latter are exuberant inflammation, developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung edema and hypoxia, as well as emergence of infections caused by pathogenic microbes and sepsis [2, 3, 50].",

In particular, specific antivirals should be available in the therapeutic arsenal and dominate in treatment during the etiotropic phase. In the case of coronavirus it can be referred to as the phase for use of lopinavir/ritonavir, aerosol ribavirin inhalation, injection of virus-specific antibodies and inhibitors of host proteases, and interferon preparations (particularly interferon 1, see above the corresponding sections). On the contrary, the pathogenetic phase should rely on a therapeutic strategy aimed at restriction or relief of pathological life-threating mechanisms by taking into consideration patient condition and severity of pathological events, mainly to eliminate intoxication, reduce lung edema, and improving blood oxygenation to compensate for lung failure, mostly by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of blood (ECMO) for avoiding rupture of swollen lungs in case of involuntary inhaled oxygen therapy. In addition, anti-inflammatory drugs should be also used during this phase to recover respiratory function by paying special attention to antibacterial therapy to prevent emerging secondary bacterial pneumonia and concomitant sepsis [51, 52].",

However, it should be noted that coronavirus disease might potentially be exacerbated due to virus evolution and continuous replacement of the initial parental virus in a single host. Such a phenomenon was described for Betacoronavirus, so that a more virulent within-patient virus strain may emerge during disease progression that could markedly aggravate it and pose a threat to the patient\u2019s (or animal\u2019s) life [53-55]. Hence, in the case of developing impaired immune response and signs of residual viral infection, administration of antivirals should be continued to lower a risk of developing higher virulence viral mutants. It seems important that a combination therapy affecting various targets in viral growth should be appropriate to use even at early the phase of infection in order to efficiently prevent emergence of highly virulent viral mutants.",
