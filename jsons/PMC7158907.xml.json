Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7\u201310 days after symptom onset, which could be associated with nosocomial outbreaks involving health-care workers.2, 4 Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success.5 No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported.6, 7, 8\n",

Our search did not retrieve any reports on clinical progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with respect to temporal viral load and concomitant serum antibody profiles. We identified one correspondence piece on viral load with no statistical analysis, and another article with a few cases of antibody response.\nAdded value of this study\nWe present findings of an observational cohort study of the temporal profile of viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses, dated by symptom onset and correlated with clinical findings. Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time. EIA of IgG and IgM against internal viral nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) showed correlation between antibody response and neutralising antibody titre.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens are non-invasive and acceptable to patients and can be used for initial diagnosis and subsequent viral load monitoring of COVID-19. The early peaking of viral load has important implications for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and hospital settings. EIA of IgG and IgM against internal viral NP and surface spike protein RBD can be used for those with delayed presentation or retrospective diagnosis of mild cases. As the positive EIA antibody level correlates well with neutralising antibody titre, further studies on its role in immunopathology or antiviral therapy are warranted.\n",

            "text": "In most studies of respiratory virus infections, serial sampling of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs is used for viral load monitoring. However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies have shown high concordance between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate as specimens for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses.9 We have reported use of posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva for diagnosis and viral load monitoring in a cohort of 12 patients with COVID-19.6 Here, we report use of self-collected posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, which avoids close contact between health-care workers and patients, for viral load monitoring. We also monitored serial serum antibody levels of patients.",

Patients were instructed and supervised by nurses. Viral transport medium was added to the saliva specimen. If patients were intubated, we obtained endotracheal aspirate instead of posterior oropharynx saliva.6, 9, 10, 11 Our initial experience showed that such saliva samples are promising in viral load monitoring in patients with COVID-19.6 We also retrieved serum remnant from blood samples taken for routine biochemical testing, and refrigerated these samples at \u221220\u00b0C until antibody testing could be done.",

Despite development of antibodies against surface and internal proteins of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA could still be detected in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from a third of patients for 20 days or longer. Peak viral load correlated positively with age. Most patients had an antibody response at 10 days or later after onset of symptoms.

However, in that study, only cycle threshold values (not exact viral loads) were reported, and no statistical or correlative analysis was done with clinical variables such as age, comorbidities, disease severity, and antibody response. The viral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV at around 10 days and that of MERS-CoV at the second week after symptom onset.4, 16, 17 The high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily, even when symptoms are relatively mild. This finding could account for the efficient person-to-person transmission noted in community and health-care settings. Clusters in families, workplaces, religious gatherings, and food premises have been widely reported.18\n",

Since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admission, the risk of emergence of antiviral resistance could be similar to that of single-drug treatment of influenza by adamantanes, acid polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. However, our previous clinical trial of influenza treatment showed that a triple antiviral combination could significantly improve the clinical outcome and viral load profile and could reduce emergence of resistant virus quasispecies.19 Currently, no standard treatment is available for COVID-19. For SARS-CoV infection, our previous treatment study showed that a combination of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and ribavirin led to significantly fewer complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) or deaths than reported with historical controls treated with ribavirin.5 Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir or interferon beta 1b also reduced lung damage and decreased viral load in a non-human primate model of MERS-CoV.20 Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling.21 Other protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment. Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated.",

The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree. Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7\u00b75 respiratory specimens per patient for testing. Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses.8, 16 Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

Second, 48% of patients enrolled had chronic medical illness, which is a higher proportion than that reported in a large clinical series (24%).30 Although a lower anti-RBD IgG level was noted among patients with comorbidities, further studies are warranted with more patients. Third, posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples cannot differentiate whether the virus is coming from the nasopharynx or from secretions from the lower respiratory tract; thus, our study cannot indicate whether SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for both upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, some patients might not clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat, which could decrease test sensitivity when compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly in patients with predominant upper respiratory involvement or mild symptoms. Finally, the most abundantly expressed internal NP might have some cross-antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino acid homology) and, occasionally, OC43-CoV (38% amino acid homology).31 Thus, the less abundantly expressed surface spike protein RBD, which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is the direct target for neutralising antibodies, was used to guard the specificity of our dual antibody assays.32\n",
