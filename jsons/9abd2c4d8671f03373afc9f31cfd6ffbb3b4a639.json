First, agency / socioeconomic success (see also Zou & Cheryan, 2017) with groups perceived as \"powerless\", \"low status\", \"dominated\", \"poor\", \"unconfident\", and \"unassertive\" on one end versus \"powerful\", \"high status\", \"dominant\", \"wealthy\", \"confident\", and \"competitive\" on the other end.

Perceived communion co-explains the effect of perceived similarity on cooperation (Balliet & van Lange, 2013) .

We predicted that U.S. residents cooperate more with members of groups they perceive as more similar to the self in agency / socioeconomic success and conservative-progressive beliefs. This would, for the first time, confirm that spontaneous (i.e., unmentioned) agency and beliefs stereotypes independently predict relevant behavior towards a variety of groups that together well-represent today's U.S. society as per its residents.",

Two equally endowed players can cooperate or defect to varying degrees by simultaneously transferring none, some, or all of their resources to their coplayer. Each transfer doubles in value. If both players fully cooperate (i.e., transfer everything), added value will be maximal, mutual, and equally distributed. If the coplayer transfers less than the player, however, added value will be less than maximal and distributed against the player's favor. And if the coplayer transfers less than half of what the player transfers, added value will no longer be mutualthe player will end up worse off than their initial endowment. Thus, players must fully defect (i.e. transfer nothing) to preclude losing resources and maximize distribution in their favor. Because mutual full defection precludes added value for both players, however, the compromise worth striving for is maximal, mutual, and equally distributed added value from mutual full cooperation.",

As low versus high anchors of the agency scale we used \"powerless / low status / dominated / poor / unconfident / unassertive\" versus \"powerful / high status / dominant / wealthy / confident / competitive\". The low anchor versus. high anchors of the beliefs scale were labeled: \"traditional / religious / conventional / conservative\" versus \"modern / science-oriented / alternative / liberal\".

Perhaps the effect of similarity in agency was larger for players who perceived the self as moderate in agency because those others who perceived the self as extreme in agency transferred less money across coplayersthat is, possibly because of \"the unfortunate have no means to contribute\" combined with \"the fortunate mean to not contribute\" (Imhoff & Koch, 2017) .
