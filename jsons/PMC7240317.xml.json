Logistic regression of selected variables of importance from the random forest model was performed to report odds ratios (ORs). Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to assess the discrimination of the final logistic regression model. For analysis of time to extubation, the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to explore the relationship between baseline variables and outcome. A multivariable analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified by location of hospital, in which (1) demographics and medical history were considered covariates and (2) deaths and patients still intubated at the time of last follow-up were censored.

In China, 12% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation, while in New York 12.2% to 33.1% of inpatients infected with COVID-19 were intubated.4,11,13 In our Chicago cohort, daily intubations for patients infected with COVID-19 gradually increased in March until peaking on March 27, 2020, which was 6 days after stay-at-home orders were announced in Illinois. The subsequent decline in daily intubations was likely related to the implementation of local mitigation policies. About a third of intubated patients were intubated upon presentation in the emergency room, a sign of the rapid clinical deterioration experienced by a subset of patients infected with COVID-19.4 Intubations were less frequent with each additional day that the patient was in the hospital, suggesting that the prognosis for a severe disease course may be determined within the first few days of admission. Once intubated, only 27.5% of patients were intubated for <7 days, while 90% had a hospital stay >10 days. Identifying and treating at-risk patients early in the infection may provide benefit in preventing disease progression.",

COVID-19-induced reduction of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which regulates inflammation and is already present in lower levels in the elderly, has been proposed as a possible mechanism leading to higher disease severity.16 ACE2 is also a component of Leydig cells within the male testes, leading to a potential site of infection and viral safe harbor, which may contribute to the higher percentage of male patients with COVID-19 as compared with females.17 However, further investigation is necessary to elucidate how age and sex influence clinical presentation.",

In the literature, BMI had not been initially discussed as extensively as other risk factors in the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to obesity not being as prevalent in the Italian and Chinese populations as in the United States.18 The United States has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world, with 40% of adults having a BMI \u226530 and 9.2% having a BMI \u226540.19,20 Initial reports from New York City have suggested that obese patients may have a higher likelihood of being admitted and placed on mechanical ventilation.4,21 The impact of obesity on severity of disease is not surprising. Obesity is already associated with decreased pulmonary function, and with the addition of COVID-19 injuring lung tissue, adequate ventilation would inevitably become more difficult.22 Biologically, obesity is also associated with higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, which may be exacerbated by the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 from infected pneumocytes and pulmonary cells.23,24",

While this study included patients treated at several hospitals, the results might not be generalizable to other institutions. Third, laboratory results were not collected and could contribute as additional predictive factors for intubation and prolonged intubation. Fourth, although data were derived directly from medical records, they were originally collected for clinical care and thus suffer from rapidly evolving practice guidelines, which may lead to bias. We utilized several statistical methods to reduce bias and confounding effects. Last, the retrospective design of this study precludes the ability to draw causal conclusions.",
