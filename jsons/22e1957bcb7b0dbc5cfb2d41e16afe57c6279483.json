It was hypothesized that MMP-8 and MMP-9 may function as biological markers to assess disease severity in viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. MMP-8 and MMP-9 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocytes obtained in both the acute and recovery phase from 153 children with mild, moderate, and severe viral lower respiratory tract infections were determined using realtime PCR. In addition, MMP-8 and MMP-9 concentrations in blood and nasopharyngeal specimens were determined during acute mild, moderate, and severe infection, and after recovery using ELISA. Furthermore, PBMCs and neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers were stimulated with RSV, LPS (TLR4 agonist), and Pam3Cys (TLR2 agonist) in vitro. Disease severity of viral lower respiratory tract infections in children is associated with increased expression levels of the MMP-8 and MMP-9 genes in both PBMCs and granulocytes. On the contrary, in vitro experiments showed that MMP-8 and MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs and granulocytes is not induced by stimulation with RSV, the most frequent detected virus in young children with viral lower respiratory tract infections. These data indicate that expression levels of the MMP-8 and MMP-9 genes in both PBMCs and neutrophils are associated with viral lower respiratory tract infections disease severity. These observations justify future validation in independent prospective study cohorts of the usefulness of MMP-8 and MMP-9 as potential markers for disease severity in viral respiratory infections.",

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most commonly identified virus with detection rates up to 40-85% in infants hospitalized for respiratory infections during winter epidemics [Wang et al., 1995; Boyce et al., 2000; Black, 2003] . The clinical manifestations range from a simple common cold to severe lower respiratory tract symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation. About 6-11% of the children admitted to hospital with RSV infection require intensive care admission [Purcell and Fergie, 2004; Berger et al., 2009] . Up to 35% of the children hospitalized with bronchiolitis did not receive any supportive intervention [Mansbach et al., 2008] . On the other hand, it is crucial to avoid discharge of those children who may experience clinical deterioration. Among children sent home with the diagnosis bronchiolitis, 4.6-6.8% required hospitalization later on during infection [Roback and Baskin, 1997; Norwood et al., 2010] . Biomarkers to assess severity of viral lower respiratory tract infections, in particular RSV infection, may be helpful to clinicians in the decision whether a child needs to be hospitalized.",

Pathologic features of severe RSV infection include extensive bronchiolar epithelial destruction, peribronchial lymphocyte infiltration, necrosis of bronchial epithelium, and mucus plugs in the small bronchioles [Johnson et al., 2007; Welliver et al., 2008] . Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are family of zinc endopeptidases capable of degrading components of the cellular matrix, and consequently, are suggested to be important in several diseases associated with tissue remodeling. Pronounced increase in their expression is thought to be associated with a variety of inflammatory disease, including respiratory diseases [Greenlee et al., 2007] .",

            "text": "MMPs play a role in cellular migration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and other immune cells to the lungs by degrading extracellular matrix, but also have pro-and anti-inflammatory properties. The activity of MMPs is regulated through binding to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) leading to inactivation. An imbalance in production and activation, or inactivation by TIMPs might augment airway inflammation through direct or indirect effects upon signaling pathways that influence migration of leukocytes through the tissues [Greenlee et al., 2007; Schuurhof et al., 2012] . Increased concentrations and activity of MMP-8 and MMP-9 have been observed in respiratory samples obtained from adults and children with acute lung injury and pneumonia [Hartog et al., 2003; Fligiel et al., 2006; Schaaf et al., 2008; Kong et al., 2009] as well as in chronic lung diseases such as asthma [Prikk et al., 2002; Obase et al., 2010] . In addition, a relation between MMP-9 concentrations and disease severity of pneumonia [Hartog et al., 2003; Schaaf et al., 2008] and asthma [Belleguic et al., 2002; Mattos et al., 2002] has been described. Yeo et al. [2002] have reported that MMP-9 protein expression is increased in human airway epithelial cell lines infected with RSV. In addition, MMP-9 gene expression is increased in the lungs of RSV-infected mice [Li and Shen, 2007] . Another study demonstrated that nasopharyngeal samples from infants infected with RSV and parainfluenza virus (PIV) contain increased MMP-9 and TIMP-1 concentrations [Elliott et al., 2007] .",

The wide range of nasopharyngeal concentrations between individuals is partly due to the variation induced by aspiration volumes from the nasopharyngeal cavity. Currently, more standardized methods have been developed, such as flocked swabs, which can be used for viral diagnostics as well as protein analysis [Dezzutti et al., 2011; Munywoki et al., 2011] . Normalization of protein levels to stable metabolites present in the mucus might further improve the use of nasopharyngeal samples for diagnostics, although these methods are not available yet. Further it should be taken in account that upper respiratory samples do not necessarily represent the situation in the lower airways and the systemic inflammatory response. The in vitro experiments in this study show that MMP-8 and MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs and granulocytes were not induced by stimulation with RSV. Other factors than direct interaction between RSV and host cells could explain the increased gene expression levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 in children with viral lower respiratory tract infections. Influx of bone marrow-derived neutrophil precursors in blood from children with severe RSV infections can result in higher MMP-9 expression due to granule protein production, such as MMP-8 and MMP-9, during immature stages of neutrophil development [Lukens et al., 2010] . Also inflammatory mediators, such as growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress upon viral infection can induce elevated gene expression levels of MMPs [Greenlee et al., 2007] . It has also been shown that the lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation has resulted in increased MMP-8 and MMP-9 expression [Albaiceta et al., 2010] . However, in this study, the last mentioned cannot completely explain the differences in gene expression since also differences in gene expression between patients with mild and moderate disease were observed, all non-ventilated patients.",

The higher MMP-8 and MMP-9 concentrations in nasopharyngeal samples compared to plasma may therefore reflect the influx and degranulation of neutrophils in the airways during infection. This is in contrast to observations made by others that suggest that airway epithelial cells are the primary source of MMPs. It has been shown that MMP-9 gene expression is increased in human airway epithelial cell lines infected with RSV [Yeo et al., 2002] . However, another study indicated that infected human airway epithelial cells are not the primary source of MMPs and TIMP-1 and that infiltrating leukocytes are responsible for MMP-9 in airway samples [Elliott et al., 2007] . Also in a RSV infection model in mice, of which it is known that the epithelial cells are not infected, it was demonstrated that gene expression of MMP-9 is elevated in the lungs most likely by infiltrating cells [Li and Shen, 2007] . For MMP-8, no correlation with neutrophil counts was observed and gene expression levels in granulocytes and PBMCs were comparable indicating that MMP-8 transcription and secretion was different regulated than MMP-9. This is supported by differences in the degranulation of subcellular neutrophilic granules, in which MMP-8 and MMP-9 are stored [Faurschou and Borregaard, 2003] and differences in transcriptional events that induce MMP-8 and MMP-9 mRNA expression. For example, it has been shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1b, play a central role in the modulation of MMP-8 expression [Knauper et al., 1993; Abe et al., 2001] . Future studies may reveal the role for MMP-8 plasma concentrations as a potential biomarker to assess disease severity in viral lower respiratory tract infections in children.",

In experimental respiratory viral infection models, inflammatory markers such as cytokines correlated with viral load and the symptom scores, indicating that the amount of virus is the driving force for inflammation [DeVincenzo et al., 2010] . Also in children, disease severity has been associated with high viral titers [Houben et al., 2010; El Saleeby et al., 2011] . Further research might reveal the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogeneses of severe respiratory viral infections [Openshaw, 2005] . In this light, it is interesting to consider inflammatory mediators, such as MMPs, as potential targets for therapy.",

First, the younger age of the children with the most severe lower respiratory tract infections may have caused a bias in the results. However, age was not correlated with MMP-8 and MMP-9 plasma concentrations, which suggests that age alone cannot explain the observed differences. According to these results, Thrailkill et al. [2005] did not found significant differences in MMP-8 and MMP-9 serum concentrations in children, 2-18 years of age. Second, multiple viruses were detected in 40% children with lower respiratory tract infections and it cannot be entirely exclude that the presence of multiple viruses have induced a different inflammatory response.",

Markers for disease severity do not have clinical implication at present, because currently antiviral treatment is not available. However, new antiviral treatment of patients will be based most likely on diagnostics predicting disease severity and susceptibility [Quinn, 2010; Hoggatt, 2011] . Furthermore, markers for disease severity are also important for research purposes to study effects of interventions, such as treatment. Although currently no biomarkers at transcription level are available in the clinic, because the processing is time consuming, innovative techniques may enable rapid analysis of the expression of multiple genes at transcriptional level in the near future [Brand et al., 2010] .",
