The clinical manifestations of children patients are similar to those of adults, such as fever and cough. A few children have diarrhea and runny nose, but the overall symptoms are relatively mild. Thirteen pediatric patients, including three neonates, had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members, who were undergone the COVID-19 RNA detection. Although the results in three neonates were positive, no lesion was found on chest CT, repeated COVID-19 RNA detection should be carried out for excluding the possibility of a contaminated sample and other reasons. As no evidence of vertical transmission has been confirmed in the previous study, 8 close contacts may be the possible explanation for the positive result in our study. Remarkably, 7 of 20 patients had a previous history of congenital or acquired diseases, which may indicate that children with underlying diseases may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Overall, pediatric patients generally have a good prognosis with an average hospital stay of 12.9 days.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "The clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection were displayed inTable 1.

As consolidations with surrounding halo sign account for up to 50% cases, they should be considered as typical signs in pediatric patients. Pleural effusion was not seen. The absorption of lesions on chest CT lagged behind clinical symptoms and nucleic acid detection. Lesions could be still visible on chest CT when two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative.As for the normal findings in three neonates with a positive nucleic acid test, whether it was due to the influence of the delivery process on sampling or the specific CT manifestations for neonates, more samples are needed for further confirmation.The CT imaging of COVID-19 infection should be differentiated with other virus pneumonias, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. 12 Adenovirus pneumonia lesions had higher density, more consolidations, and fewer subpleural lesions. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus pneumonia lesions were mostly distributed along the bronchial tree with a thickened bronchial wall. Influenza viruses could cause grid-like changes in the lungs. In addition, it should be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, and chlamydia pneumonia, and the density of pneumonia lesions caused by the latter pathogens is relatively higher. However, chest CT manifestations of pneumonia caused by different pathogens overlap, and COVID-19 pneumonia can be superimposed with pneumonia caused by other types of pathogens, presenting more serious and complex imaging manifestations, so epidemiological and etiological examination should be combined. In conclusion, COVID-19 virus pneumonia in children is mainly mild, and chest CT can present characteristic changes of subpleural ground-glass opacities and consolidations with surrounding halo, which is an effective means for follow up and evaluating the changes of lung lesions. In the case that the positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid test from pharyngeal swab samples is not high, the early detection of lesions by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment for pediatric patients. However, the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia by CT imaging alone is not sufficient enough, especially in the case of coinfection with other pathogens. Therefore, early chest CT screening and timely follow-up, combined with corresponding pathogen detection, is a feasible clinical protocol in children.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTERESTS"}, {"text": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4224-3057Yu Guo http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2296-3276", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Jianbo Shao"}]}
