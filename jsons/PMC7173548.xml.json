In the mouth saliva is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, watery liquid containing 99% water and 1% organic and inorganic substances and dissolved gases, mainly oxygen and carbon dioxide. Salivary constituents can be grouped into proteins (e.g., amylase and lysozyme), organic molecules (e.g., urea, lipids, and glucose mainly), and electrolytes (e.g., sodium, calcium, chlorine, and phosphates).1 Cellular elements such as epithelial cells, leucocytes and various hormones, and vitamins have also been detected. The composition of saliva is modified, depending on factors such as secreted amount, circadian rhythm, duration and nature of stimuli, diet, and medication intake, among others.",

The afferent arm is mainly activated by stimulation of chemoreceptors (located in the taste buds) and mechanoreceptors (located in the periodontal ligament).4 Olfaction, mental processes, and stretch of the stomach are weak stimuli. Impulses affecting secretion depending on the emotional state are carried by afferent cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X to the CNS salivary nuclei (salivation center) in the medulla oblongata. The efferent part of the reflex is mainly parasympathetic. The cranial nerve VII provides control of the submandibular, sublingual, and minor glands, whereas the cranial nerve IX controls the parotid glands. The flow of saliva is enhanced by sympathetic innervation, which promotes contraction of muscle fibers around the salivary ducts.5 Autonomic nerves also have an important role in both gland development and function.6 A dry mouth is a common experience where there is fear.",

Published studies are heterogeneous, from isolated case reports of kissing as a \u201cpossible\u201d cause of transmission of diseases (e.g., HIV infection)29 to studies analyzing the inhibitory activity of the saliva on specific microorganisms (e.g., herpes simplex).30 Few studies have been designed specifically to demonstrate the degree of infectivity if any of kissing, but one study showed it does not efficiently spread common cold infection by Rhinoviruses.31\n",

            "text": "Oral carriage of microorganisms and infections are more likely where there is hyposalivation and/or immunoincompetence\u2014and so infections may be more prevalent in neonates who lack acquired immunity, or where immunity wanes such as in older or patients with immunocompromising conditions (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, HIV/AIDS, or corticosteroid therapy)\u2014particularly where the load of infecting agents is high or the microbe is virulent.\u2022\nSpecific saliva protection against oral bacteria\nSaliva has a mechanical flushing action and there are innate immune defenses and complex interactions with microorganisms.55., 56. For example, the gene DMBT1 (Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumor 1) encodes antimicrobial proteins involved in mucosal innate immunity, and salivary DMBT1 glycoprotein (gp340) and salivary agglutinin (DMBT1(SAG)) glycoproteins which are identical, agglutinate S. mutans and some other Gram-positive bacteria, as well as several Gram-negative bacteria.57 Some of the salivary components can change with disease; e.g., higher interleukin (IL)-6/IL-1\u03b2, secretory IgA, and lower lysozyme, and histatins 1 and 5 have been found in hepatic cirrhosis.58\nThe innate and acquired immune defenses in saliva persist even after removal of lymphoid tissue in tonsillectomy: serum-derived antimicrobial proteins (myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, IgG) remain in high concentrations in whole saliva with no effect on the numbers of oral cariogenic S. mutans or on the total aerobic flora.59\n\u2022\nSpecific saliva protection against bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa often colonizes the airways in cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa binds to oral and bronchial epithelial cells,60., 61. by pili and fimbriae which promote adherence to glycosphingolipid adhesins asialo-GM1 on surfaces of host epithelia and phagocytes such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes.62., 63., 64. Failure to isolate pathogenic organisms consistently from the upper airways in all patients with positive sputum argues against a local epithelial factor predisposing to bacterial colonization65 and also suggests that defensive processes are in play. P. aeruginosa are aggregated by saliva.The sero-mucous products of the submandibular gland have a greater role than the serous secretions of the parotids and are possibly responsible for the differences in oral colonization by P. aeruginosa in different subjects.66 The low-molecular-weight mucin (MG2) of human submandibular\u2013sublingual saliva, and neutral cystatin, bind to pili.67\nP. aeruginosa interactions with S. aureus may be predicated on the formation of MG2\u2013secretory IgA antibody complex, which may facilitate clearance from the oral cavity.68\nInterbacterial adherence between strains of P. aeruginosa with oral Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and with strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae, appear to involve galactosyl-binding adhesins.69 Most oral viridans streptococci have potentially bacteriocin-like activity against P. aeruginosa.70\n\u2022\nSpecific saliva protection against viruses such as HIV\nSaliva may also be inhibitory to HIV. Though complete inactivation may require 30 minutes of exposure, saliva may inhibit HIV-1.71., 72., 73., 74., 75., 76. A main protective mechanism of saliva may be the inactivation of HIV-transmitting leukocytes by the hypotonicity of saliva77 and the oral transmission of HIV by seminal and other fluids introduced into the mouth may be due to their isotonicity overcoming the inactivation of HIV by isotonic saliva.78 HIV transmission across mucosae involves complex mechanisms and the oral mucosal epithelia mucosa is less permissive for HIV replication than other sites (e.g., vagina/cervix and anal/rectal).79 Innate immunity plays a role in protection.80 Viral reception appears to involve both CD4 (Cluster of Differentiation 4) and a co-receptor\u2014particularly CCR5 (Chemokine Receptor type 5).81 The MHC appears to have a role in HIV-1 control, particularly the HLA Complex P5 (HCP5) and Human Leukocyte Antigen-C (HLA-C) and this may explain the occurrence of \u201cElite Supressor\u201d patients.82\nThe scavenger receptor protein gp340\u2014encoded by the DMBT1 gene\u2014interacts with surfactant proteins (SP-D), and both gp340 and SP-D can individually and together interact and agglutinate some viruses and DMBT1(gp340) binds to a variety of other host proteins, including serum and secretory IgA, C1q, lactoferrin, MUC5B, and Trefoil Factor 2 (TFF2), all molecules involved in innate immunity and/or wound healing.57 The protein gp340 appears to facilitate HIV transmission across genital but not oral mucosa.83., 84., 85., 86. Acquired immunity might confer some protection in re-exposures: immunization with an HIV peptide may produce HIV-inhibitory antibodies in saliva.87\nVarious glycoproteins may also be inhibitory to HIV. Crude saliva and salivary mucins MUC5B and MUC7 (both from HIV-positive people and uninfected controls) can inhibit HIV-1.46., 88. Other glycoproteins may also be implicated.89., 90.\nSLPI may have an important HIV-inhibitory role,91., 92. as might human \u03b2-defensins (hBDs) from the epithelium.93., 94. Saliva may also mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against HIV.52\n\u2022\nSpecific saliva protection against influenza A virus\nOther viruses as. e.g., H5N1 influenza virus are particularly susceptible to human saliva, which may play a role in its infectivity and transmissibility.48\nMany salivary antibacterial proteins have antiviral activity, typically against specific pathogens.41 Antiviral activities of saliva against influenza A virus (IAV) and HIV differ both in terms of specific glandular secretions and the inhibitory proteins. Whole saliva or parotid or submandibular/sublingual secretions from healthy donors inhibits IAV, whereas only submandibular/sublingual secretions are inhibitory to HIV. Among salivary proteins, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein 340 (gp340), MUC5B, histatins, and human neutrophil defensins at concentrations present in whole saliva inhibit IAV, while acidic proline-rich proteins and amylase have no activity nor do several less abundant salivary proteins (e.g., thrombospondin or serum SLPI).95\ngp340 interacts with surfactant proteins A and D (SP-D) and can interact and agglutinate IVA virus and also binds to proteins involved in innate immunity and/or wound healing, including serum and secretory IgA, C1q, lactoferrin, MUC5B and TFF2.57 Salivary gp340 can antagonize SP-D antiviral activities\u2014which may be relevant to the effects of aspiration of oral contents on SP-D-mediated lung functions.96\nOther components responsible for antiviral activity on influenza virus, in particular swine origin influenza A virus (S-OIV), include an \u03b1-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and an A2M-like protein.97\nSalivary glycoproteins which have significant roles against IVA also include lectins (e.g., MAL-II and SNA).98\nMUC5B inhibits IAV by presenting a sialic acid ligand for the viral hemagglutinin.95 Other sialic acid\u2013containing molecules may be effective against human influenza viruses more so than against H5N1.48\n\u2022\nSpecific saliva protection against fungi such as Candida spp.\n",

            "text": "Bacterial pathogens have been identified in salivary samples by specific antibody reactivity, antigen detection, or via PCR, including Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum, and a wide range of Streptococcus spp. More than 20 viruses have also been detected; these include a number of Herpes viruses, Hepatitis viruses, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, Papillomavirus, Influenza virus, or Poliovirus. Nonviral and nonbacterial infectious agents including fungi and protozoa are also detectable, usually by antibodies to these infectious agents. Recognition of the components of the oral microbiota can help in the prediction of the onset, progression, and prognosis of oral and systemic diseases. Tests for these pathogens are currently under development. Omics methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and metabolomics, can play an essential role to explore microbial community and its metabolite production, without the biases of microbial culture. Saliva contains many antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents which modulate the oral microbial flora. Consequently, detection and shedding of infectious agents in saliva does not necessarily mean transmission by this route. Anyway, the presence of these pathogens in saliva is particularly important in immunosuppressed patients in whom infections can result fatal. Moreover, the defensive ability of saliva against emerging infectious diseases caused by new or previously unrecognized microorganisms remains unknown.",
