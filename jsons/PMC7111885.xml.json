The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation (for VZV) in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) were recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",

Thirty min after exposure of the MT-4 cells to the test compounds, the cell cultures were infected with HIV-1 (NL4.3) at 3 pg p24/well (or 60 pg/ml). The virus dose affords full cytopathicity after 4\u20135 days of incubation in the absence of the test compounds (control). Therefore, after 4\u20135 days incubation at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2-controlled atmosphere, cytopathicity was microscopically recorded.
