The chapter begins with a brief overview of the different types of health research conducted within correctional facilities and among those leaving jail or prison. I then describe some of the unique obstacles that correctional health researchers encounter and assess some of the methods they have used to overcome these obstacles. Since researchers in correctional settings face significant ethical dilemmas, I next consider recent frameworks for making ethical decisions about this research. Finally, I suggest an agenda for future health research in correctional settings.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have examined the health and demographic profile of incarcerated populations. These vary from large studies based on national samples and using multiple health outcomes such as the reports of the National Correctional Health Care Commission on the health status of soonto-released inmates (2002a, 2002b) or of the health status of inmates in Texas prisons (Baillargeon, Black, Pulvino, & Dunn, 2000) to studies of a single outcome such as hepatitis C among California inmates (Fox et al., 2005) . The various reports of the Bureau of Justice Statistics on mental health, substance use, and other health conditions (e.g., James & Glaze, 2006 , Karberg & James, 2005 summarize data across U.S. jurisdictions, providing an opportunity for correctional and health officials to identify incarcerated populations in higher need. Other studies describe patterns of health care utilization among inmate populations (Leukefeld et al., 2006) . Investigators often compare the health status of different subpopulations, e.g., men to women (Peters, Strozier, Murrin, & Kearns, 1997) , or African-Americans and Latinos to whites (Rounds-Bryant, Motivaus, & Pelissier, 2003) . These descriptive studies are used to identify the needs of various segments of the incarcerated populations, to compare changing incidence or prevalence of conditions over time, or to serve as a baseline for the subsequent evaluation of interventions. Research imperatives in these studies are consistent definitions of dependent and independent variables, uniformity in data collection methods in multisystem studies, and sampling strategies that enable generalizations to other settings.",

For example, numerous investigators have sought to determine whether the higher prevalence of HIV infection among U.S. prison populations was due to intraprison transmission or to criminal justice policies that led to incarceration for people already HIV infected (Hammett, 2006; Krebs & Simmons, 2002) . Most studies suggest the latter route is more important, reassuring correctional authorities that within-prison transmission, while it does occur, is not a major factor in higher rates. On the other hand, studies in the early 1990s established that TB transmission did occur within the facility, leading to substantial efforts to prevent such transmission (Bellin Fletcher, & Safyer, 1993) . Others have investigated whether incarceration is associated with homelessness and mental illness (McNeil, Binder, & Robinson, 2005) . The main analytic task in these studies is to distinguish between causal and noncausal associations between incarceration and selected health outcomes.",

Health impact assessment, an analytic method developed to assess the health effects of both health and non-health-related policies, offers a promising approach to consider the health consequences of various prison and criminal justice policies (Davenport, Mathers, & Parry, 2006; Kemm, 2001 , Veerman, Barendregt, & Mackenbach, 2005 .

            "text": "Finally, a growing number of researchers are studying the impact of incarceration and correctional policies on the health of families, communities, and populations. For example, some research looks at the impact of incarceration on children and other family members (Murray & Farrington, 2005; Barreras, Drucker, & Rosenthal, 2005) . Researchers have asked whether incarceration policies have contributed to the community transmission of HIV infection (Leh, 1999; Johnson & Raphael, 2006) or other sexually transmitted infections (Thomas & Sampson, 2005) , community rates of violence (Rose & Clear, 2003) , or disparities in health between black and white U.S. populations (Taxman, Byrne, & Pattav, 2005; Johnson & Raphael, 2006; Iguchi, Bell, Ramchand, & Fain, 2005) . These studies can help policy makers consider the impact of various incarceration policy choices. This brief summary of the types of questions that correctional health researchers have sought to answer illustrates the scope of the field. For neophyte investigators, becoming familiar with the findings and methodological challenges in the extant literature relevant to their question of interest can save years of trial and error in this difficult setting and avoid duplication of effort. For more experienced researchers, a familiarity with the scope of prior research can help them move from descriptive to analytic and intervention studies. Several recent reviews provide a good starting place for becoming familiar with recent correctional health research (Edens et al., 1997; Freudenberg, 2001; Magaletta, Diamond, Dietz, & Jahnke, 2006 , Morris, 2001 Pollack, Khoshnood, & Altice, 1999) .",

Each level brings different concerns and requires different assurances in order to allow the research to proceed. For example, frontline correctional officers who may be required to bring participants to the researcher for interviews or medical examinations want to make sure these procedures do not interfere with their routines or increase staff workloads. Wardens often need to be assured that no research procedure will jeopardize security. In another example, a jail security warden was concerned that a stylus for a handheld computer device used for interviews with inmates could be used as a weapon. It took several meetings between a warden and a research team to agree on a type of stylus and interview procedures. Senior officials of corrections departments are sometimes ambivalent about studying illegal behavior such as drug use or voluntary or coercive sexual behavior. If they know that a problem exists, they may have an obligation to address it so that agreeing to research on these topics can have significant administrative, legal, and cost implications. Researchers will need to be prepared to address these concerns.",

Strategies that have been used to increase follow-up rates include collection of multiple contact names at study entry; frequent interim contacts in order to maintain updated locators, use of both service and financial incentives, and use of public records (e.g., \"rap sheets\" and criminal records) in lieu of face-to-face contacts.",

For example, a study of women and male adolescents leaving New York City jails examined the impact of individual characteristics, the jail and reentry experience, conditions in the returning community, and changing municipal policies on crime, welfare, and housing on returning inmates' drug use, HIV risk behavior, and reincarceration (Freudenberg et al., 2005) . Multilevel analyses consider the contributions of variables at multiple levels to the variability in a particular individual-level dependent variable, e.g., drug use. In public health, multilevel research is increasingly used to assess the relative influence of neighborhood and individual-level variables on health (Diez-Roux, 2001) .

Their report called for additional protection for certain \"vulnerable\" populations, including children, neonates, pregnant women, and prisoners. In 1978, the Commission issued a report titled \"Additional Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects\" (U.S. DHHS, 2005) .

When staff are not convinced of the morality of a research study, they may intentionally or unintentionally undermine the study, either by providing services to the \"control\" group or by communicating their discomfort to research participants, thus discouraging enrollment in a study. For this reason, it is important for researchers to address this issue forthrightly.",

In some cases, several different IRBs need to approve a single study and occasionally offer conflicting guidance on how to proceed. These complaints have a variety of sources: some investigators prefer the old way of business where researchers alone decided on the conduct of their studies. But even researchers who support the importance of protecting prisoners note that IRB members often lack expertise in the day-to-day realities of correctional institutions and the nonresearch risks inmates encounter daily. They also report that IRB committees often reflect the wider tension between protecting participants from research harm and ensuring access to beneficial services and in their effort to maximize both of these aims impose unreasonable demands on researchers.",

It is therefore not surprising that in this anarchic and complex environment correctional health researchers have yet to develop a coherent and comprehensive research agenda driven by existing scientific knowledge and public policy imperatives. However, the fact that it may be difficult to envision and articulate such an agenda should not stop the effort. In fact, as health and correctional officials and researchers request additional support for correctional health research, it is inevitable that they will be asked to set priorities. And if researchers themselves fail to take the lead in this process, others will impose an agenda on them.",
