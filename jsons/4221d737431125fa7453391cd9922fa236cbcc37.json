Here we used a human non-immune antibody phage-display library and the H5 hemagglutinin ectodomain to select ten neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that were effective against all group 1 influenza viruses tested, including H5N1 'bird flu' and the H1N1 'Spanish flu'. The crystal structure of one such nAb bound to H5 shows that it blocks infection by inserting its heavy chain into a conserved pocket in the stem region, thus preventing membrane fusion. Nine of the nAbs employ the germline gene VH1-69, and all seem to use the same neutralizing mechanism. Our data further suggest that this region is recalcitrant to neutralization escape and that nAb-based immunotherapy is a promising strategy for broad-spectrum protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza A is a scourge of the young and old, killing more than 250,000 worldwide each year, while creating an economic burden for millions 1 . Pandemic influenza, which occurs when a new virus emerges and infects people globally that have little or no immunity, represents a grave threat to human health; for example, the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic caused an estimated 50 million deaths 2,3 . Vaccines have historically been the mainstay of infection control. However, owing to rapid antigenic drift, the vaccine antigen must be updated annually based on global influenza surveillance 4,5 , and it is not always fully successful. In addition, some recent H5N1 vaccines have shown promising results [6] [7] [8] [9] , but none has been reported to elicit a broad neutralizing response in humans. Neuraminidase inhibitors, especially oseltamavir (Tamiflu), remain the primary treatment, but they have limited efficacy if administered late in infection, and widespread use is likely to result in the emergence of resistant viral strains 10, 11 . Influenza A is subclassified by its two major surface proteins: hemagglutinin, which mediates cell entry, first by recognizing host proteins bearing sialic acid on their surface, and second by triggering the fusion of viral and host membranes following endocytosis, allowing viral RNA to enter the cytoplasm; and neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acid from host and viral proteins, facilitating cell exit 12 . There are 16 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-16) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes (N1-9) that make up all known strains of influenza A viruses by various combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase 12 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 online) .",

Sequence and structural analysis of all 16 hemagglutinin subtypes point to the existence of just two variants of this epitope, corresponding to the two classic phylogenetic groupings of hemagglutinin (groups 1 and 2). We therefore tested eight more group 1 hemagglutinin subtypes and demonstrated an unprecedented cross-subtype binding and/or neutralization spectrum. Because we had used a group 1 subtype (H5) for our panning, our nAbs, as expected, failed to neutralize group 2 subtypes H3 and H7. These results nevertheless raise the possibility that a cocktail comprising a small subset of nAbs raised against representatives of the two groups could provide broad protection against all seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses.",

            "text": "The broad neutralizing behavior against H5 may be attributed in part to the exclusive role of VH in antigen binding and the use of a common germline gene, VH1-69, in five out of the six VHs, although their CDR3 loops are variable in sequence and length (13-17 residues) (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1 online). In addition, free-energy calculations 26 point to dominant binding contributions (B70% of the total favorable free energy) of the three conserved residues in the VH segment (Fig. 4b) . In CDR-H2 derived from germline VH1-69, position 55 is always phenylalanine, and position 54 is always hydrophobic (methionine, isoleucine, leucine or valine). In our nAbs, CDR-H3 always has a tyrosine predicted to lie at the tip of the CDR3 loop (conserved at the position 6). The conformation and sequence of the CDR1 loop does not seem to be critical, because the other antibodies we isolated do not contain the somatic mutation (G26E) found in F10 and are predicted to have canonical structures. The sixth VH gene we isolated is derived from the germline gene VH1-2; its H2 loop has the same length as VH1-69, but by virtue of a change from alanine to arginine at position 72 (ref. 22) it is predicted to adopt a distinct conformation ('type 3') that presents loop residues 3 and 4 to the antigen (rather than residues 4 and 5 in type 2 loops). The specific somatic mutation at position 4, from asparagine to methionine, presumably promotes H5 binding. It is not possible to predict the structure of the larger H3 loop, but a tyrosine located at the center of the loop may play an analogous role to that in F10. Thus, the F10-H5 crystal structure suggests a common mechanism of H5 virus neutralization for our nAb panel. They make no contact with the receptor binding sites in the head and so do not inhibit cell attachment. Rather, they lock the fusion peptide and helix aA in place, thereby preventing the large structural reorganizations that are required for membrane fusion 17, 19, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Our data point to this event occurring at an early step in infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the nAbs act at a later stage, given the close packing of molecules on the surface of the mature virion, which might restrict early access to the epitope. The only previously published crystal structure of a hemagglutinin-nAb complex that inhibits membrane fusion uses a different mechanism: it prevents conformational changes by cross-linking the upper surfaces of adjacent subunits in the head 31 .",

Residues without a circle are not directly involved in the epitope but are discussed in the text. Colored highlighting on the sequences indicates conservation within clusters and groups, with orange indicating high conservation or invariance. Other colors (for example, yellow, cyan and pink) highlight residues that are cluster or subtype specific. The network of interhelical contacts that stabilize the fusogenic structure 61 are indicated below the HA2 sequences. Subtypes that can be recognized/ neutralized by F10 are indicated with '+' on the far right. (+) or (\u00c0) indicates a predicted positive or negative binding, respectively. ",

The epitope may be divided into three elements. (i) At its center, the sequence of the N-terminal segment of HA2-fusion peptide residues 18 2 -21 2 -is conserved across all hemagglutinin subtypes (note that the side chain at position 19 2 does not participate in binding). (ii) A downstream segment of HA2 adopts part of the aA helix (residues 39 2 -56 2 ), which is nearly invariant; the only significant difference is a threonine to glutamine change at position 49 2 in the untested H9 cluster subtype, H12. Thr49 2 lies at the periphery of the epitope and makes one long hydrogen bond (3.5 \u00c5 ) to Ser31. Simple modeling suggests that there is plenty of space to accommodate the larger glutamine side chain and that it can make comparable hydrogen bonds. (iii) Smaller contributions from segments of the HA1 chain (residues 18 1 and 38 1 ) and a loop at the base of the head (residues 291 1 and 292 1 ). Three-dimensional comparisons of the epitope in the five known crystal structure subtypes (three from group 1 (H1, H5 and H9) and two from group 2 (H3 and H7) 21, 32, [34] [35] [36] show that they adopt two distinct structural classes consistent with the phylogenetic groupings 32, 33 (Fig. 7) . These differences arise from group-specific differences in the location of buried residues, notably histidines (H111 2 is unique to group 1; H17 1 is unique to group 2) that have been proposed to be the 'triggers' for pH-induced conformational changes 29 . The differences cause the side chain of Trp21 2 to turn through 901 in group 2 subtypes, eliminating favorable binding to Phe55 from our nAb panel. In addition, four out of six group 2 subtypes are glycosylated at position 38 1 , at the periphery of the F10 epitope; our modeling studies predict steric clashes with the CDR-H1 loop (data not shown). These structural differences rationalize the observed lack of binding and neutralization of group 2 hemagglutinin subtypes and viruses.",

It is straightforward to model the locations of the F10 epitope residues in this model of the fusogenic state (Supplementary Note 1 online). All eight epitope residues, which were fully exposed in the neutral pH structure, become either part of the new hydrophobic bundle core (Thr41 2 , Ile45 2 , Val52 2 and Ile56 2 ) or they make networks of hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal arms and other elements that stabilize the new bundle (Lys 38 2 , Gln42 2 , Thr49 2 and Asn53 2 ). The requirement for adopting two entirely different conformations, each with a distinct hydrophobic core and hydrogen-bonding network may place powerful evolutionary constraints on the sequence of the helix, as evidenced by the almost complete lack of genetic drift within helix aA among the 16 hemagglutinin subtypes.",

Following three in vitro passages, we readily isolated a mutant VN04 virus (K193E) that was resistant to 22F. In contrast, we failed to identify any viruses resistant to any of our three IgG1s (D8, F10 or A66). Although these experiments cannot prove that escape mutants with unimpaired viral fitness will never arise, they clearly support the notion that the pocket is more refractory than epitopes in the head.

Moreover, C179 was shown to block membrane fusion rather than cell attachment and to protect mice against viral challenge 41 , although a detailed mechanism was not reported. We compared the activities of C179 and F10 and found that both showed similar binding toward H5. We also found that F10 efficiently competed with C179 for binding to H5, but not vice versa ( Supplementary Fig. 9 online) . Furthermore, the point mutant V52 2 E abrogated binding to both antibodies, whereas T318 1 K affected only C179 binding.

Moreover, the 'type 2' H2 loop, which is long and compact, is predicted to occur in only 4 out of the B50 human germline genes. These factors may explain at least in part the ability of nAbs derived from this germline gene to cross-react with viral epitopes through their unusual ability to bind to conserved hydrophobic pockets. Such pockets are likely to have an important function and for this reason they are often cryptic in the unactivated state of the antigen. For example, VH1-69 is the predominant gene used by a group of CD4-induced nAbs raised against the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein, gp120, where the pocket is part of a conserved co-receptor binding site that is exposed only transiently upon binding to its primary receptor, CD4 (ref. 43) . Similarly, an antibody raised against the HIV gp41 trimeric 'inner-core' fusion protein intermediate uses the hydrophobic tip of its VH1-69 CDR-H2 loop to insert into a conserved hydrophobic pocket that blocks further assembly to the fusion-competent six-helix structure 44 . In vivo, B cells carrying the VH1-69 gene are the primary mediators of innate defense against HCV infection, generating antibodies against its membrane-fusion glycoprotein, E2 (ref. 45) , although the epitope and mode of action have not been determined. Notably, as we found here, VH1-69 is not the only germline gene that is suitable for achieving neutralization in a similar manner. Another recent example is a nAb against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, KZ52, which uses the VH3-21 germline gene 46 . However, their common ability to lock viral envelope proteins into a nonfusogenic conformation suggests a general strategy for broad-spectrum and/or potent viral neutralization.",

It is unlikely that the F10 epitope provokes self-tolerance mechanism(s) via auto-antigen mimicry 48 (Supplementary Note 5 online). Rather, we hypothesize that an immunodominant antibody response to the highly exposed globular head may overwhelm the antibody response to the F10 epitope, although it remains possible that other immune exclusion mechanism(s) may preclude natural antibody responses against it. It is not surprising that many viruses are highly adept at keeping their most crucial (and conserved) determinants of pathogenesis cryptic, in which case subunit-based vaccines, using properly presented fragments of F10 or F10-like epitopes, may offer distinct advantages over whole virus-based approaches to induce broad spectrum nAbs in vivo 49, 50 .",

We show that they inhibit the post-attachment fusion process by recognizing a highly conserved epitope within the stem region of hemagglutinin at a point where key elements of the conformational change are brought into close apposition. Our initial experiments suggest that this region is recalcitrant to the generation of escape mutants. The prospects for their use for passive immunotherapy would therefore seem to be excellent, either alone or in combination with small-molecule inhibitors (Supplementary Note 6 online). Finally, our structural work pinpoints the reasons why group 2 hemagglutinins do not bind the nAbs described here: despite surface sequence similarities, they form a structurally distinct group, but one that is also highly conserved and therefore may be amenable to a similar panning discovery approach.",
