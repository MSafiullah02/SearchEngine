The name Coronavirus originates from the Latin word corona, meaning \u201ccrown\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d, due to its characteristic appearance under two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy. Coronaviruses have club-shaped spike peplomers covering their surfaces (Figure 1) [5].",

Within the Coronaviridae family and Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are transmissible to humans. The Alpha- and Betacoronavirus strains are thought to have originated from the bat species (Rousettus leschenaultii) [6-8]. Clinical presentation can vary widely, ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death. The Alphacoronavirus strains 229E and NL63, along with the Betacoronavirus strains OC43 and HKU1, tend to cause only mild symptoms. The Betacoronavirus strains MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), and SARS-CoV-2 are known for causing severe respiratory distress. In recent history, several outbreaks have occurred related to these Betacoronavirus strains. Figure 2 depicts the genomes and structures for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [9].",

Once the virus enters the host cell, the viral RNA is exposed. Open reading frames 1a and 1ab (ORF1a and ORF1ab) are translated, producing polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). These polyproteins are later cleaved to form structural proteins for the RNA replicase-transcriptase complex, which is responsible for the replication and transcription of viral RNA. Viral nucleocapsids are assembled and bud from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). As viral nucleocapsids encase viral RNA to produce new coronavirus virions, they are exocytosed, completing the replication cycle. Viral replication is summarized in Figure 3 [11-13].",

            "text": "Incubation periods may vary but have been known to be between 1 and 14 days for other coronaviruses. To date, the median observed incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to be 5.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5-5.8 days), with 97.5% of those who develop symptoms doing so within 11.5 days (95% CI: 8.2-15.6 days) of infection [27]. Although the risk of transmission from an asymptomatic individual may be low, it is still possible. The basic reproduction number (R0), or the number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible, has been reported to be between 2.13 and 4.82, which is similar to SARS-CoV [28]. At the cellular level, once viral particles enter the respiratory tract, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 receptors for pulmonary cell entry [29]. ACE-2 is a type 1 transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase, which, under normal physiological circumstances, functions in the degradation of angiotensin II to modulate the renin-angiotensin System (RAS) [30]. The viral S protein binds to the ACE-2 receptor, prompting cellular membrane fusion and endocytosis. This process is dependent on S protein priming by a serine protease (TMPRSS2) in many coronavirus models, potentially identifying a future treatment modality [31-32].",

Similarly, groups have voiced concern over ACE inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. This concern is due to their mechanism of action and up-regulation of the ACE-2 receptor, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 in cell entry [47]. No studies have been performed to evaluate this theoretical risk. Currently, the expert opinion recommendation for patients on ACEi or ARB therapy is to continue their current drug regimen. Many societies have made statements regarding this matter and are detailed in Table 2 [48].",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. It is one of seven human transmissible coronaviruses and is thought to have originated from the bat Coronavirus. The first human cases were documented in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and are thought to be a result of transmission through an intermediate host, likely the pangolin. Human-to-human disease transmission primarily occurs through respiratory droplets. Once in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 enters the pulmonary cells through endocytosis via the ACE-2 receptor. The mean incubation time is 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5-5.8 days), with 97.5% of those who develop symptoms doing so within 11.5 days (95% CI: 8.2-15.6 days). Symptoms may vary from mild to severe but are typical of other viral illnesses including Influenza. The basic reproduction number is reported to be between 2.13 and 4.82. Those most affected by COVID-19 are those of advanced age and those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions. Final mortality rates are currently unknown, as a large portion of cases have not yet resolved, but estimated case fatality is between 0.25% and 3.0%. Treatment options are limited to supportive care and management of ARDS in severe cases. Ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, camostat mesylate, and tocilizumab as potential therapies. Lopinavir and ritonavir do not appear to be effective. Currently, no vaccine is available, although efforts are in progress to developing a vaccine over the coming year. Caution should be used when using corticosteroids in non-ARDS COVID-19 patients, as no mortality benefit has been observed and viral clearance can be prolonged. The use of ACEis and ARBs should not be discontinued in efforts to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 per current society statement.",
