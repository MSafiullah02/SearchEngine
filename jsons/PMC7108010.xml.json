            "text": "Our rates of hospitalizations for CAP are consistent with those reported by Marston et al. [1] in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored prospective study of radiographically confirmed hospitalization for CAP patients in 2 counties in Ohio in 1991. After adjusting for differences in the age distribution of persons aged \u2a7e65 years in the 2 study populations, our age-adjusted hospitalization rate of 10.4 cases per 1000 person-years was nearly identical to the rate of 10.1 cases per 1000 person-years among community-dwelling seniors reported by Marston et al. [1]. The Ohio study did not, however, include an assessment of outpatient visits for CAP, which is particularly important, given the trend towards outpatient treatment that has occurred over the past 2 decades. We found that, even among persons aged \u2a7e80 years, nearly one-half (49.3%) of CAP events were treated on an outpatient basis. Inclusion of outpatient episodes allows a more comprehensive estimate of the burden of disease and a more accurate assessment of risk factors for CAP. Persons with chronic conditions who develop CAP are more likely to be hospitalized for treatment than are persons without chronic conditions. This means that assessments restricted to hospitalizations for CAP will likely overestimate the association of those conditions with the risk of CAP.",

A survey of hospitalizations associated with a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code reported in Medicare claims [3] found a significantly higher risk among men than among women, as did a follow-up assessment of the risk of a hospitalization associated with a pneumonia diagnosis among participants of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) [17]. Neither of these studies assessed whether male sex was associated with pneumonia after adjusting for other risk factors, so it was not clear in these studies whether male sex was simply a marker for a higher prevalence of other risk factors. A population-based study involving 4175 elderly persons in Finland found that crude CAP rates did not differ between men and women and that male sex was not significantly associated with CAP after accounting for age and certain chronic medical conditions and risk factors, including asthma, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, and heart disease [21]. Because our study population was much larger than that of the Finnish study, we have more power to detect an independent risk of CAP associated with male sex if such a risk truly exists. However, it is possible that the difference in risk we observed could be the result of confounding by factors unmeasured in our population.",

The 1999\u20132000 influenza season is recognized as having been more severe than the several preceding seasons [10], and timing of the peak rate of CAP for the elderly GHC population in this study period closely matched the peak proportional pneumonia and influenza mortality rates in the United States, occurring in late December 1999 and early January 2000.

However, this problem is likely to be more significant for pneumonia treated on an outpatient basis (in which a health care provider may only see a patient early in the course of the illness and assign a diagnosis before the evaluation has been completed) than in cases in the hospital setting (in which the discharge diagnoses are assigned at the end of the hospital stay and should represent a more complete assessment of the illness episode).",
