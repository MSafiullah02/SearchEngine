In an effort to reduce the risk of infectious diseases at Hajj, an array of preventive measures have been recommended by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH), which include vaccination and hygiene measures (Table 1\n).5 However, studies have demonstrated that vaccine uptake and compliance with hygiene and protective measures are highly variable among pilgrims,6, 7 and the reasons behind this variability remain unclear.",

To address these questions, two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among Australian pilgrims, one before and one after the Hajj 2014, to identify what preventive advice and interventions pilgrims received before travel, and what factors influenced their compliance with these measures while they were there.",

Similar quantitative findings have been reported among members of the general Singaporean community,37 but not previously among Hajj pilgrims. Another important factor identified as a driver for the use of facemasks was protection from air pollution. A recent study found that the air pollution level in Makkah during the Hajj consistently exceeds internationally acceptable standards,38 and therefore this perception is probably justified and could inform health promotion policy.",
