Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues playing a key role in their mechanism of action. The docking studies were carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further studies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, invitro and in-vivo biological evaluation are required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of the viral life cycle.",
