            "text": "INTELLiVENT-ASV\u00ae (I-ASV) is a closed-loop ventilation mode that automatically adjusts the ventilator settings of adaptive support ventilation (ASV). It automatically controls the fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FIO2), percentage minute ventilation (%MV), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) by using end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO2), respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation of pulse oximetry (SpO2) to keep the patient\u2019s lung ventilated safely. I-ASV can be managed using only one mode during the entire mechanical ventilation period, without pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) or pressure support ventilation (PSV). The ASV algorithm is based on the minimal work and force of breathing [1], which is related with the minimal inspiratory pressure and tidal volume. Among the oxygen parameters, FIO2 and PEEP are adjusted automatically to reach a target SpO2 and prevent over-oxygenation. Although several studies have reported the usefulness of I-ASV [2\u20137], the clinical situations in which it should be used have not yet been clarified. Moreover, there are few experienced facilities where I-ASV can be used, and therefore, its usage status and efficacy have not been reported.",

The PaO2/FIO2 (P/F) ratio on day 1, the use of vasopressors on day 1, the use of analgesics (fentanyl, and/or morphine) and neuromuscular blockade, the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were also determined. The medical history, including the presence of end-stage renal function on hemodialysis and the hemi-lung status, was evaluated. Regarding ventilatory parameters, the type of ventilation mode and the duration of MV were evaluated. The reason for changing from I-ASV to a different ventilator mode was determined from the electronic medical records. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score [8] and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [9] on day 1 were used to assess the severity of each patient\u2019s illness. The mortality rates during the ICU stay were also evaluated. In our ICU, we have more than 10 years of experience using a sedation analgesia protocol for ventilated patients. In brief, 10-30 \u03bcg/h of fentanyl is the first choice analgesics to maintain patients at Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 0\u20132. In case of severe inspiratory drive, we use morphine 1-3 mg/h instead of fentanyl. In regard to sedation, our main goal of level of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients during daytime is Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) of \u2212 1 ~ 0 and \u2212 2 ~ \u2212 3 during night time. The choice of sedatives and analgesics and the use of rescue haloperidol depend on each attendant physician\u2019s decision. Neuromuscular blockage is allowed to use within 48 h only for patients who present P/F ratio < 150, presence of severe respiratory effort or severe asynchronies. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of I-ASV success as the primary endpoint.",

We generally use automatic control of %MV for all patients, but the use of automatic control of FIO2 or PEEP depends on each attendant physician\u2019s decision. Cases mainly ventilated in I-ASV mode (apart from brief phases) were considered I-ASV successes. Brief phases of I-ASV switch-off were attributed to (a) PCV immediately after tracheal intubation, (b) PSV for a manual spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) although I-ASV succeeded SBT automatically, and (c) a lack of medical staff experience with I-ASV (e.g., the activation of SpO2 and ETCO2 sensors on the G5). In the absence of physicians experienced with I-ASV, our clinical protocols allowed physicians without these specific skills to switch off this advanced mode and use a conventional mode. In such cases, I-ASV was re-started as soon as possible. Brief phases of I-ASV switch-off were defined as periods of < 24 h in a conventional mode before switching back to I-ASV. Patients who did not meet that criterion were classified into I-ASV failure group, which also included patients who did not receive I-ASV during MV.",

To evaluate the factors associated with successful management using I-ASV, a logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the non-adjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using model 1 (age, sex, BMI, presence of sepsis, end-stage renal function on hemodialysis, P/F ratio, and APACHE II score) and model 2 (P/F ratio and APACHE II score). The variables of this model were selected manually which could clinically affect I-ASV success. The number of included variables in multivariate analysis were limited because of low sample size. A forward stepwise elimination process was used to remove non-significant variables from the model. Using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), we assessed the ability of each independent factor to predict successful ventilation with I-ASV [10]. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Moreover, we identified the APACHE II score as a significant independent predictor of successful ventilatory management using I-ASV.",

Several studies have demonstrated the usefulness of I-ASV. Arnal et al. [2] reported that compared to ASV, I-ASV is safer and can provide ventilation with a lower pressure, volume, and FIO2 in passive patients with acute respiratory failure. In addition, Lellouche et al. [5] reported the safety of I-ASV for maintaining an optimal range of respiration in post-cardiac surgery patients. A randomized controlled trial that aimed to compare the efficacy of I-ASV with conventional ventilation methods in critically ill patients [7] found I-ASV to be a safe and effective option in terms of tidal volume, respiratory rate, SpO2, and ETCO2. However, these studies were performed for short durations and did not evaluate the long-term success rates of I-ASV. Therefore, our study is the first to evaluate the long-term success of I-ASV in a real clinical situation.",

Along with the finding that strong respiratory drive was one of the reasons for discontinuation of I-ASV, high APACHE II scores may be related to strong respiratory drive and I-ASV failure. In line with the severity of illness or organ dysfunction, P/F ratio is also considered as the indicator of acute respiratory failure and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Athough not statistically significant in multivariate analysis, P/F ratio was indeed associated with I-ASV success (Table 1). Moreover, the AUROC of P/F ratio < 186 was 0.736, and this was even slightly higher than the AUROC of APACHE II. Relatively small number of patients in this study might influence these results. However, these results also suggest that in cases of moderate to severe ARDS or severe multi-organ dysfunction, management by I-ASV alone may be quite difficult.",

Initially in the first year, we actually used I-ASV mainly for relatively low APACHE II score, such as post-operative patients. With the accumulation of the experience of using I-ASV, we gradually used I-ASV for more severe patients like ARDS patients. Considering the learning curve to learn how I-ASV work, and even if it appears simple at first sight, we think that medical stuff knowledge and experience with I-ASV are the key to success of the management with this mode. In addition, when compared to other conventional ventilation methods, I-ASV is expected to reduce the burdens on medical staff members (e.g., physicians and nurses) because of the automation. Although there is little evidence regarding the reduction in medical staff workloads, I-ASV might be a better choice for the majority of mechanically ventilated patients.",

            "text": "I-ASV may be difficult to manage in some cases because of the strong respiratory effort required in patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia and respiratory/metabolic acidosis. A strong respiratory effort frequently requires high minute ventilation. As I-ASV has a setting limitation of 200% of 100 mL/predictable body weight, ventilated patients who require high minute ventilation might find I-ASV to be challenging. Moreover, ventilation with I-ASV during a high inspiratory flow rate becomes difficult due to asynchrony. In such cases, it is important to switch to an appropriate ventilation mode rather than continue with I-ASV. In this study, there were a few cases in which the trigger for spontaneous inspiration was suppressed by changing to PCV. Furthermore, in such situations, the use of narcotics such as morphine, sedatives, or muscle relaxants should be considered.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, this was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. The number of the patients were relatively small. These may limit the power of the study. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings. Second, there was a selection bias due to the specific choice of G5. In our ICU, G5 is preferred in cases of hypoxemia and severe organ dysfunction rather than in cases involving post-elective surgery, and this preference could have influenced the success rate of I-ASV. If the number of post-elective surgery patients exceeded the number of patients with hypoxemia and severe organ dysfunction, it could have increased the success rate of I-ASV. Third, we did not correct ventilatory parameters such as the tidal volume, driving pressure, and PEEP. Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether I-ASV was superior to other conventional ventilator modes in this study. We are currently conducting a prospective study (UMIN000034417) to evaluate the usefulness of I-ASV and mechanical power compared to other conventional ventilation modes. Fourth, we did not record the types of asynchronies in detail. Hence, further studies are required to evaluate the types of asynchronies that increase the difficulty of respiratory distress management with I-ASV. Fifth, we did not have objective parameters for high respiratory efforts, like esophageal pressure. Sixth, we did not collect the type of sedative drugs and doses. Because the optimal suppression of the respiratory drive with sedatives may directly relates to the success of I-ASV, and because asynchronies, which we found in this study associated with I-ASV success, can occur in either the situation of over-sedation or under-sedation. Further studies are needed to evaluate about this issue. Finally, since the proficiency of medical staff with I-ASV mode varies, our results might differ from those of other high-volume centers. However, this study included the first 3 years of experience I-ASV in our ICU, and therefore our results may be useful with respect to the initial use of I-ASV.",
