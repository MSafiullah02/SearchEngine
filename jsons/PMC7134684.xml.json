M pneumoniae is a frequent cause of respiratory disease in humans. The pathogenic mechanism of the bacterium involves its association or cytoadherence with the respiratory mucosa. The bacteria interact with the host cells through an attachment structure that is composed of multiple subunits that bind to various host cell receptors including sulfated glycolipids.3 Once attached, M pneumoniae induces the generation of superoxide radicals and inhibits catalase, leading to oxidative stress in the host cell. M pneumoniae infection also induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-8, in part through engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs).3 Infection ultimately leads to various pathologic changes to the respiratory epithelium including loss of cilia, metabolic derangements, and sloughing.",

Evidence suggests that established allergic airway inflammation may hinder clearance of the pathogen. Using a mouse model, Wu and colleagues4 found that TLR2 expression was down-regulated in the presence of allergic inflammation and M pneumoniae infection. Recently, Wu and colleagues5 also reported that low-dose M pneumoniae infection enhanced underlying allergic lung inflammation and augmented the T-helper 2 (Th2) response to allergen. By contrast, high-dose M pneumoniae infection attenuated the allergic response. Furthermore, Hoek and colleagues6 demonstrated that rodent mast cells release IL-4 when cocultured with M pneumoniae, suggesting that M pneumoniae infection may promote allergic inflammation. Lastly, Chu and colleagues7 found that M pneumoniae infection of allergen-sensitized mice resulted in an increase in airway collagen deposition. These animal studies suggest that M pneumoniae infection in the lung may play a role in asthma development, pathology, and disease activity.",

C pneumoniae exists in 2 forms, the replicating reticulate bodies and the infective elementary bodies. After being released into the extracellular environment, the elementary bodies interact with respiratory epithelial cells, leading to phagosome formation and subsequent intracellular replication. In the lungs, C pneumoniae infection has been shown to increase endothelial nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB with subsequent up-regulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules, chemokines such as IL-8, and platelet-derived growth factor.8 Epithelial cell adhesion molecules are also increased, leading to an influx of inflammatory cells. In addition, C pneumoniae may participate in airway remodeling through promotion of fibroblast proliferation driven in part by IL-6 and other growth factors.8 Similarly to M pneumoniae infection, the immune response to C pneumoniae is multifactorial and includes innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune mechanisms.",

Recently, Bulut and colleagues11 established that C pneumoniae heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) contributed to the development of acute lung inflammation in mice, and concluded that cHSP60 may play a role in both acute and chronic lung inflammation.

            "text": "There are significant limitations and challenges in diagnosing atypical bacterial infections in the lung. Current techniques include culture, antigen detection, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culturing atypical bacteria is time-intensive and technically difficult. Other methods for detection include enzyme immunoassays (EIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and microimmunofluorescence.3 For C pneumoniae, detection of IgM antibodies typically at 2 to 3 weeks after infection or a fourfold increase in IgG antibodies in convalescent sera suggests acute infection. For M pneumoniae, the EIA is frequently used to compare acute and convalescent sera looking for a fourfold increase in antibody titers. PCR detection of atypical bacteria is more sensitive, but there is a lack of standardization and availability. In addition, the correlation between these different diagnostic tests is fairly low.12 A definitive diagnosis may require invasive tissue sampling, which is infrequently performed. Due to the lack of standardized tests and discordance between detection methodologies, there are limitations in the ability to accurately detect atypical bacterial infections of the lung, which subsequently affects the conclusions that can be drawn from available studies evaluating the role of atypical bacteria and asthma. Emerging techniques such as multiplex PCR and microfluidic platforms for M pneumoniae may provide methods for fast and sensitive diagnosis.13\n",

The investigators subsequently concluded that C pneumoniae infection may contribute to asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, Cunningham and colleagues18 evaluated 108 children with asthma, and obtained nasal aspirates and sera if there was a significant decrease in peak flow or an increase in respiratory symptoms.

Acute infection was diagnosed by either elevation of specific IgM at initial serology or a 4-fold increase in IgG titers at follow-up. The subjects were divided into 3 groups for data analysis. Group 1 included 119 subjects with acute exacerbation of asthma. Group 2 consisted of 51 subjects presenting with their first onset of wheezing. Group 3 comprised 152 controls with chronic, stable asthma without exacerbation in the previous 6 months and/or allergic rhinitis. In group 1, M pneumoniae was found in 24 subjects (20%) and C pneumoniae was detected in 4 (3.4%) subjects during exacerbation. In the new-onset wheeze group, M pneumoniae was detected in 26 subjects (50%), a statistically significant difference when compared with group 1, and C pneumoniae was identified in 4 (8.3%). In the control group, only 8 (5.2%) had evidence of M pneumoniae. At 1-year follow-up, 62% of subjects in group 2 who had been diagnosed with an atypical infection had recurrence of asthma compared with only 27% of noninfected subjects in that group.

In their study, bronchoscopy with airway brushings was performed on 11 asthmatic subjects and 6 nonasthmatic controls with subsequent culture of airway epithelial cells at an air-liquid interface with and without M pneumoniae. MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression were measured using PCR and ELISA techniques. The investigators found a significant increase in MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression in the asthmatic cells that were exposed to M pneumoniae and that this increase was attenuated by coculture with an NF-\u03baB or TLR2 inhibitor.22 Kraft and colleagues subsequently postulated that the increased mucin expression in asthmatic epithelial cells in response to M pneumoniae likely involves TLR2 signaling and NF-\u03baB activation. Similarly, Morinaga and colleagues23 also found that C pneumoniae infection of airway epithelial cells led to an increase in MUC5AC expression that could be reduced by treatment with macrolides and ketolides.

Culture, serology, and PCR techniques were used to evaluate for M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae. The primary outcomes were symptom scores and morning PEFs.

The subjects completed methacholine challenges, spirometry, chest radiography, and upper and lower airway sampling, which included PCR analysis for M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae. The subjects were randomized to receive clarithromycin or placebo for 6 weeks with subsequent evaluation of lung function and measurement of inflammatory mediators. Significant findings include evidence of M pneumoniae and/or C pneumoniae in 56% of asthmatics. PCR-positive treatment subjects experienced an increase in FEV1 (2.50 \u00b1 0.16 to 2.69 \u00b1 0.19 L; P = .05) that was not found in PCR-negative subjects in the treatment group or in controls. The investigators analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage samples for cytokine expression, and found a reduction in TNF-\u03b1, IL-5, and IL-12 mRNA in the PCR-positive asthmatics treated with clarithromycin and a reduction in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 mRNA in treated subjects who were PCR-negative. There were no changes noted in inflammatory cytokines in the placebo group. Kraft and colleagues concluded that clarithromycin improved lung function in patients with evidence of atypical bacteria in addition to reducing pulmonary inflammatory cytokines in both PCR-positive and -negative subjects.",

Simpson and colleagues.44 treated severe, refractory asthmatics without known M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae colonization with clarithromycin or placebo for 8 weeks and found improved quality-of-life scores and reduced sputum IL-8 in the treated subjects. The investigators speculated that macrolides may provide effective adjunctive treatment, especially for those with severe asthma and presumed neutrophilic disease, primarily because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Although some studies suggest a possible therapeutic benefit from use of antimicrobials in asthma, it remains unclear as to who would benefit from therapy and whether any improvement in lung function or symptoms can be sustained. The most recent Cochrane review in 2005 to evaluate the effects of macrolides for chronic asthma cited insufficient evidence to currently recommend their use.45 This topic clearly requires further investigation to better understand the role of antimicrobial therapy in asthma.",

In addition, there is mounting evidence to suggest that atypical bacterial infections may also affect the severity of disease, although a causal role for the development of asthma has not been proved. Significant limitations exist in diagnosing atypical bacterial infections in the lung because of difficulties with sampling and lack of standardized detection methodologies. Numerous animal and human studies have outlined mechanisms by which atypical bacterial infections may contribute to airway obstruction through promotion of allergic airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Additional trials are needed to clarify the role of antimicrobials for atypical bacteria in asthma. As our understanding of the role of atypical infections in asthma expands, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapies targeted for specific asthma phenotypes may provide new therapeutic options.",
