There are numerous agents with potential toxic effects on the lungs including cytotoxic and noncytotoxic drugs. Common causes of drug-induced lung disease include chemotherapeutic agents, amiodarone, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are a number of recognized cofactors that may enhance the likelihood of a pulmonary drug reaction, particularly reactions associated with chemotherapeutic agents. These include advanced age, prior radiotherapy, and elevated inspired oxygen levels; the presence of any or all of these factors increases the likelihood of developing a pulmonary drug reaction. Surgery may even be a precipitating event (Camus et al. 2004a ).",

This division is artificial and the distinction between toxic reactions and idiosyncratic reactions is not always clear cut. Several risk and exacerbating factors for diffuse lung disease have been identified. Some of them include advanced age (60 years or older) and existing pulmonary lesions (Kubo et al. 2013 ).",

Acute respiratory failure due to drug-associated ILD generally has an unpredictable onset and rapid time course (onset of clinical manifestations within minutes to hours of taking the drug). Patients with acute drug toxicity present with the progressive or rapid onset of dry cough, high fever, and dyspnea. These patients often require admission to the intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation (Prasad et al. 2014; Camus et al. 2004b ). The identification of drug-induced lung disease requires an active consideration of any change in the patient's clinical course as a possible response to medications. There are no pathognomonic signs, symptoms, laboratory tests, or pathologic features that identify a drug as the cause of the illness. Further, drug-induced lung disease must be distinguished from more common illnesses or causes of acute exacerbation of an ongoing illness such as asthma, infection, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary thromboembolism. A history of drug exposure and a consistent radiological pattern may be diagnostic tools.",

The presentation and clinical course are highly variable and depend from intensity and duration of exposure to the antigen and the nature of the antigen and specific factors of the host, such as an individual predisposition probably genetically determined (Spagnolo et al. 2015) . According to data from registries of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in three European countries, HP accounts for 4-15 % of all ILD cases (Thomeer et al. 2001 ). However, the incidence and prevalence of HP are difficult to estimate with precision, mainly because of the number of cases that are misdiagnosed or not recognized and a lack of uniform diagnostic criteria. The disease is diagnosed on the basis of a history of exposure to an offending antigen with onset of compatible clinical, HRCT, or physiological findings within 4-12 h. Other diagnostic criteria include clinical improvement after removal from exposure and recurrence on reexposure. In cases where the inciting antigen cannot be identified or in the presence of conflicting clinical, radiological, and functional findings, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy are indicated. Surgical lung biopsy is only required if these prove inconclusive (Elicker et al. 2016 ).",

In this regard, (Selman et al. 2012) proposed an alternative classification scheme based primarily on disease behavior, distinguishing between acute nonprogressive and intermit-tent disease, acute progressive/subacute disease, chronic nonprogressive disease, and chronic progressive disease. Which pattern of illness occurs presumably depends upon the intensity and duration of contact, the nature of the antigen, and host factors. Acute HP is characterized by an influenza-like syndrome occurring a few hours after a substantial exposure. Symptoms gradually decrease over hours/days but often recur with reexposure. Acute episodes can be indistinguishable from an acute respiratory infection caused by viral or mycoplasmal agents. Attacks often follow exposure to the allergen within enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Patients typically have a restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced DLCO or, in rare cases, an obstructive pattern. Mild hypoxemia at rest is common. In general, the acute form is nonprogressive and intermittent, with spontaneous improvement after antigen avoidance (Selman et al. 2012 ).",

Diffuse ground-glass opacity is usually bilateral and symmetric but sometimes patchy and concentrated in the middle part and base of the lungs (Cormier et al. 2000; Zompatori et al. 2003) (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, ground-glass opacity (GGO) superimposed on a background of chronic changes may be observed in acute exacerbation of chronic HP or in chronic cases following intense exposure to antigens. HRCT abnormalities observed in the subacute phase of the disease may be more specific and include numerous poorly defined nodules, GGO, and areas of decreased attenuation. The nodules with low-density and ill-defined mar-gins usually present less than 5 mm in diameter (also defined centrilobular ground-glass opacities). In terms of their aspect, the nodules are similar to snowflakes. Poorly defined nodules may be the predominant (Fig. 2) or only associated abnormality in patients with subacute HP. These abnormalities represent cellular bronchiolitis, peribronchiolar interstitial inflammation, or, less frequently, focal organizing pneumonia (Maffessanti and Dalpaz 2011) .",

Alveolar flooding appears with over 25-30 mmHg, resulting in the radiological appearance of confluent acinar opacity (Morgan et al. 1991; Ketai and Godwin 1998) . It is important to remember how the radiographic picture depends also from the acuteness or chronicity of heart failure: edema in acute heart failure is determined by lower pressure gradients, but may not show at chest X-ray dilatation of the heart and of the vessels. On the contrary, chronic heart failure determines an increase in the compliance of the heart and of the pulmonary vessels, and higher pressures are required to determine vascular dilatation (Ketai and Godwin 1998) . Chest X-ray has some intrinsic and technical issues that limit its diagnostic accuracy (Ware and Matthay 2005; Ketai and Godwin 1998) . Before radiographic changes start to appear, the water content of the lungs may have to increase up to 30 %; alterations may persist up to 24 h after regression of the edema; bedside radiograms obtained with portable X-ray equipment have intrinsically poor technical quality, and they are affected by factors related to the difficulty to optimize the technique of execution, such as positioning of the patient, patients' body weight, degree of inspiration, type of ventilation applied, and focal film distance and exposure; consolidation at chest X-ray is a nonspecific finding, reflecting loss of the air content of the alveoli, and may be subtended by processes other than HPE, such as hemorrhage, pneumonia, inflammation, or tumor.",
