            "text": "Diarrhea disease is one of major threats that afflict the global pork industry in recent years, which has caused an estimated loss of multi-million dollar annually. Various pathogens that can cause diarrhea in swine have been identified, and swine enteric coronaviruses are the most destructive pathogens that are able to result vomiting, dehydration and lethal watery diarrhea in piglets [1]. To date, four swine enteric coronaviruses have been defined, including three Alphacoronaviruses [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)], and one porcine deltacoronavirus [porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)] [2]. TGEV has been circulating in swine for decades since 1946 [3], whereas PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV are regarded as three emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses [2]. PEDV was first discovered in England in feeder and fattening swine in early 1970s [4], and subsequently circulated in Asia, Europe and America [5]. In late 2010, a highly virulent PEDV caused epidemic diarrhea in all age groups of swine in China and US, with 80%-100% morbidity and 50%-90% mortality in suckling piglets which made the pork industry suffer destructive blow [[6], [7], [8]]. PDCoV is a relatively new coronavirus that was identified in 2009 in Hong Kong [9]. However, the first outbreak of PDCoV in Ohio in 2014 addressed its clinical significance [10]. Until now, the detection of PDCoV has been reported in Canada, South Korea, China, Thailand, Laos [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Among these viruses, SADS-CoV is the most newly discovered coronavirus, which has been first reported in 2017 in China and is considered to be an HKU2-related coronavirus with a bat-origin [[16], [17], [18]]. The fatal diarrhea caused by SADS-CoV has led to the death of 24,693 piglets in a short time in South China. Plentiful epidemiological investigations have shown that there is a co-infection between PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV in swine, and their clinical symptoms and pathological characteristics are extremely similar [[19], [20]], which makes it difficult to distinguish these coronaviruses in clinical infections.",

Currently, the most commonly detection methods for swine enteric coronaviruses such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), PCR and IHC (immunohistochemistry), all depend on laboratory diagnosis and possessed the advantages of high sensitivity and accuracy, and have been widely used [[31], [32], [33], [34]]. However, most of these diagnostic assays are complex, time-consuming, and require a large of reagents and well-equipped laboratories, which limit their application in remote areas. Therefore, it is urgent to develop portable POC devices with characters of simple, timely, multi-target and strong pertinence, so as to detect pathogens early, prevent the spread of infectious disease and reduce mortality. Amongst the various biosensor-based methods that have been reported, centrifugal microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is the most recent innovation tool in microfluidic field, which can make analytical assays perform in a multiple, high throughput and integrated format with high efficiency and speed [35, 36]. Centrifugal microfluidic devices actually have the CD-like chip combining microfluidic unit operations, such as liquid mixing, metering, aliquot, switching, valving and storage, which are controlled by the centrifugal speed of the chip [37, 38].",

To form an integrated microfluidic chip, a kind of pressure-sensitive film was applied to seal the micro-channel of chip via suitable pressure. The microfluidic chip comprised four independent units, each of which was consisted of a sample well, a vent and eight micro reaction wells (Figure 1\nA). The ball valve played a significant role throughout the process ensuring that the reaction mixture diffused into the adjacent pipe and the reaction wells were filled with liquid. The volume of each micro reaction well was 5 \u03bcL. The supporting microfluidic detection equipment (dimensions: length, width, and height are 280 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 135 mm) was actually a device (Product Model: AJYGene TM MA2000) that was equipped with the functions of constant temperature control, high-speed centrifugation and fluorescence reading and analysis, and was provided by iGeneTech (Ningbo, China). Once microfluidic detection equipment starts running, the sample would be uniformly distributed in each reaction chambers at two step centrifugal forces (1600 RPM/min, 30 sec and 4600 RPM/min, 10 sec). While the reaction was performed at the given temperature, the microfluidic device gathered fluorescence signals of each micro chambered every minute and displayed in real time on the electronic screen.",

Figure 3D-F showed that the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system enabled the detection of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV within 40 min and the detection limit for each of the three viruses were maintained at 101 copies/\u03bcL, 102 copies/\u03bcL and 102 copies/\u03bcL, respectively. Those detection limits of this system were competitive for the application to POC diagnostic device [[39], [40], [41]]. The sample-to-answer time on-chip for diagnosis, including nucleic acid extraction, adding reaction solution, sealing and reaction, was approximately 1.5 h. On the other hand, the total volume of sample and reaction buffer used for one on-chip detection hole was roughly 25 \u03bcL. Undoubtedly, the new method developed here was a cost-effective and time-saving way for PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV diagnosis with POC platform when compared with existing methods [[39], [40], [41]]. In addition, the semi-logarithmic regression analysis was performed using the data from the sensitivity test results of standard samples (Figure 3G-I). There was a significant linear relationship between the logarithm of the plasmid concentration and the Tt value for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV with the R2 values of 0.965, 0.9827 and 0.9572, respectively, which indicated the potential quantitative detection capability of this established diagnosis platform. Effective development of diagnostic platform such as microfluidic chip requires ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity to enable real-time analysis needed for clinical detection [42]. Based on above data, the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system is competitive and competent in POC diagnosis of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV in remote areas, either for early clinical diagnosis or surveillance and outbreak investigation.",

For this part, the high, medium and low detectable concentration standard samples were used to validate the reproducibility and stability of the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system. We calculated the C.V. through dividing the standard deviation (SD) by the mean of different samples at the same concentration. The results of Figure 4\nA-C demonstrated the stability of our method. For the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system, the C.V. values of the standard samples of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV ranged from 2.52% to 3.43%, 1.78% to 2.29% and 2.59 % to 3.75% respectively with small SDs (Figure 4 G-I). All the above C.V. values were less than 5%, indicating the good reproducibility of each established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip method. The results were further confirmed by the clinical PEDV-, PDCoV- and SADS-CoV-infected fecal samples (Figure 4D-F), which showed ideal C.V. values of 3.71%, 2.43% and 1.69% for each coronavirus (Figure G-I). In summary, the developed CD-like microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system for the point-of-care diagnosis of multiple genes of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV is promising, and can be applied to the real-time qualitatively monitoring of these three coronaviruses with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity.",

To further verify the actual performance of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system in clinical samples, we collected 173 swine diarrhea samples, of which 80 PEDV positive samples, 59 PDCoV positive samples, 52 SADS-CoV positive samples and 17 negative samples were detected by the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system and referenced qRT-PCR assays. There were 12 samples co-infected with two or three coronaviruses. No negative sample detected by the qRT-PCR assays was found to be positive by the developed microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system. The coincidence rates (the proportion of the number of samples with the same test results in the total number of test samples) of the detection results between the qRT-PCR and the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system were 97.69%, 97.11% and 97.11% for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively (Table 2\n). Sensitivities of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip for each virus were 95.24%, 92.19% and 91.23%. Additionally, specificities of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip for three viruses were all 100%.
