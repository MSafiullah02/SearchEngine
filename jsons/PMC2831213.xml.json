Pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV can occur in all age groups. The average mortality rate is 9.6%; however, among the elderly the rate is 38% to 50% (Chan et al., 2003a, Chan et al., 2003b, Chiu et al., 2003, Donnelly et al., 2003, Tsui et al., 2003). The potential for SARS-CoV outbreaks is still warranted since palm civets (Guan et al., 2003) and bats (Li et al., 2005) have been implicated as possible zoonotic reservoirs for SARS-CoV or closely related SARS-like viruses.",

            "text": "The discovery and evaluation of effective therapeutics for newly emergent clinical diseases such as SARS-CoV require well-defined animal models. Several groups have reported the use of small animal models which may reproduce some features of SARS in humans. These small animal models, particularly mice (Hogan et al., 2004, Roberts et al., 2005a, Wentworth et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004) and hamsters (Roberts et al., 2006, Roberts et al., 2005b), can provide experimental systems for the study of infectivity, immunity and pathogenesis, while serving as a very useful tools for screening of vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, their utility in the study of the clinical progression of disease is limited by the inherent differences between small mammals and humans in anatomical structure, respiratory physiology and manifestation of clinical disease. Furthermore, FDA approval of vaccines and therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases such as SARS requires demonstration of efficacy in at least two animal models\u2014a rodent and a nonrodent. The nonhuman primate has been used as a model for studies of clinical progression and evaluation of treatments for SARS-CoV infection and disease pathogenesis. However, there has been animal-to-animal variability in the level of viral replication in the lung tissues from SARS-CoV infected African green monkeys (McAuliffe et al., 2004), cynomolgus macaques (Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006, Kuiken et al., 2003b, Lawler et al., 2006, Osterhaus et al., 2004) and rhesus macaques (Qin et al., 2005, Rowe et al., 2004, Tang et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2005). Reported symptoms in SARS-CoV infected cynomolgus macaques (Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006, Kuiken et al., 2003b, Lawler et al., 2006, Rowe et al., 2004) or rhesus macaque (Li et al., 2005, Qin et al., 2005) included lethargy, skin rash, respiratory distress, interstitial pneumonia, and diffuse alveoli damage. Although nonhuman primate models mimic infection and disease symptoms seen in humans, they are very expensive and require special housing and husbandry practices not available in most BSL3 facilities.",

Ferrets have not been commonly used as animal models; therefore, and the literature sources about them are limited. However, these animals have shown great promise in reproducing human correlates of disease for influenza. Preliminary studies showed that the domestic ferret presents disease symptoms and pathology similar to that observed with SARS-CoV infected humans (Martina et al., 2003). When both cats and ferrets infected with SARS-CoV via the intratracheal route using high-virus titer (up to 106 TCID50 U/mL), the cats showed no clinical symptoms except shedding virus, whereas the ferrets showed classical symptoms of SARS, including death in some cases, in addition to shedding virus (Martina et al., 2003). These studies suggested that the ferret could be developed into a model for preclinical evaluation of efficacy for SARS-CoV therapeutics.",

Older adult patients infected with SARS-CoV often develop a severe febrile pneumonia [for example see (Peiris et al., 2003b)]. In contrast to SARS in adults, SARS in young children tends to be a relatively mild disease. Adolescents can experience significant respiratory disease similar to adults, but younger children generally do not (Bitnun et al., 2003). Symptoms such as myalgias, chills, and headache, which are common in adults, are usually absent in children (Leung et al., 2003, Wong and Fok, 2004). Children have a shorter course of illness, and generally do not develop significant pulmonary disease requiring assisted ventilation (Bitnun et al., 2003, Chiu et al., 2003, Hon et al., 2003, Leung et al., 2003, Leung et al., 2004, Puthucheary et al., 2004). Adults and children appear to have similar levels of SARS-CoV viremia associated with infection, implying that levels of viral replication are similar in both groups (Ng et al., 2003, Ng et al., 2004). Adults with SARS have significantly increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Hon et al., 2003, Huang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2004). Activation of inflammatory cytokines in children with SARS may be less dramatic (Ng et al., 2003). Thus, immune response may account for variations in SARS severity between age groups. Development of animal models that reflect these variations in the human population is challenging. However, we noted several parameters common in many of the cases such as temperature, diarrhea, viremia and neutralizing antibody; hence, we sought to discover an animal model that displays these symptoms.",

            "text": "The ferret belongs to the order Carnivora, family Mustelidae, and is related to mink, otters, and weasels. The domestic (European) ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has been domesticated for thousands of years (Ball, 2006). Ferrets have some unique applications including study of human influenza (Renegar, 1992, Smith and Sweet, 1988), and peptic ulcer disease (Del Giudice et al., 2001, Fox et al., 1997). In addition to many basic research applications, ferrets are under active investigation as a nonrodent model in drug development (Fox et al., 1997). More recently, the ferret was explored as a model for SARS; however, the few reports in the literature show apparently conflicting data with regard to infection and pathogenesis of ferret with SARS-CoV, primarily because of differences in study designs, age of animals, and endpoints examined. While Martina et al. have shown that ferrets support SARS-CoV replication and develop pulmonary lesions (Martina et al., 2003), Weingartl et al. have reported that ferrets remain asymptomatic in the presence of SARS-CoV replication (Weingartl et al., 2004). Herein we have demonstrated that the ferret is a suitable model for permissive SARS-CoV infection, which shows clinically relevant indicators of illness and disease progression. Clinically, we showed temperature increase and sneezing in challenged animals. Fever is one of the disease markers for SARS-CoV infection in humans (Bitnun et al., 2003, Booth et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003b, Tsui et al., 2003, Wong and Fok, 2004), and in ferrets a temperature increase was significant from 2\u20136 d.p.i. Sneezing was consistently observed in ferrets from 5\u201310 d.p.i. (Table 1) but was not observed in mock-infected or challenged ferrets.",

The dose used in this study (103) reached similar virus titers used at the higher doses reported. We detected significant levels of SARS-CoV in lung, nasal turbinates, nasal swab and pharyngeal swab samples from infected animals. Virus replication could be detected from 2\u20137 d.p.i., and the highest peak of virus replication was detected in the upper respiratory region (nasal turbinate) followed by the lower respiratory region (lung). We detected viral RNA by RT-PCR in the nasal and pharyngeal swabs through 7 d.p.i. In general, most animal models show peak days of viral RNA in the lung and nasal turbinate samples from 2 to 7 d.p.i. Ferrets infected with 103 or 104 TCID50, sustain viral replication at 106 TCID50/mL at 4 d.p.i. (Martina et al., 2003), while ter Meulen et al. show a peak day of infection at 7 d.p.i., in the lung (ter Meulen et al., 2004). Both studies used the SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849. Studies reported by Weingartl et al. and Czub et al., however, showed much longer persistence of viral RNA in lung, pharyngeal and feces samples (Czub et al., 2005, Weingartl et al., 2004). One of the more promising models for SARS-CoV pathogenesis in rodents is the Golden Syrian Hamster, which shows sustained viral replication in the nasal turbinates and lungs (Roberts et al., 2007). After intranasal inoculation with 103 TCID50 of SARS-CoV, peak viral replication in the lungs occurred at 3 d.p.i. and was cleared by 7 d.p.i; however, viral titers in nasal turbinates were about 10 to 100 folds lower than in lungs and detected through 14 d.p.i.(Roberts et al., 2005b). In our ferret study, viral titers in the nasal turbinates were about 100- to 1000-fold higher (five logs above background) than in the lungs. Virus was also detected in the spleen and liver of the hamster (Roberts et al., 2005b); in contrast, we did not detect virus or viral RNA in the liver of the ferret.",

Disease-enhancing antibodies may be induced after natural viral infections as demonstrated with dengue and feline coronaviruses (Green and Rothman, 2006; Smith and Sweet, 1988, Olsen et al., 1992 ). Antibodies to the spike protein of the feline coronaviruses are involved in antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Passive transfer of sera from SARS-CoV infected mice provided protection against subsequent challenge (Subbarao et al., 2004). The absence of histopathological change in the lungs of the challenge group is an indication of the absence of immune pathology in ferrets. The increase in neutralizing antibodies from 7 to 14 d.p.i. correlated with a decrease in viral burden observed in the lung, nasal turbinates, nasal swab and pharyngeal swab samples. Upon challenge one month after primary infection, a significant increase of antibody titers was observed and the antibody titer was higher than that seen after primary infection. The boost in antibody titer may have contributed to the lower viral burden observed after the challenge. Therefore, neutralizing antibodies can be considered as a correlate of protection in SARS-CoV infected animals. In summary, the SARS ferret model and the endpoints identified herein provide a platform for investigations into the immune response and pathogenesis, as well as the evaluation of the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV disease.",

Baseline values for these parameters were obtained from 47 pre-study blood samples obtained from 26 ferrets. Ferrets are an unidentified species on the Advia, and Bayer protocol states that samples were run using dog species selection. Differences in normal erythrocytes between dogs and ferrets lead to many ferret samples being flagged for microcytosis and/or hypochromasia. Dog MCV normal ranges are 58.8\u201371.2 fL and ferret MCV normal ranges are 46\u201365 fL. Dog MCHC normal ranges are 31.0\u201336.2 g/dL and ferret MCHC normal ranges are 29\u201336 g/dL.
