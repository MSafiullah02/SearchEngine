It encodes the MC4R protein, a G protein-coupled receptor that binds the \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH). In murine models, MC4 receptors have been found to be involved in the feeding behavior, regulation of metabolism, sexual behavior, and male erectile function [3]. In animal models, deletion of MC4R also results in hyperphagia and increased body fat, ultimately leading to hepatic steatosis without atherogenic diet [4].",

BMI SDS value of this case was 7.3 SD (severe obesity). The patient\u2019s mother was shown to have a heterozygous variant (mother\u2019s BMI SDS, 1.5 SD), and no sample could be taken from the father. It was decided that the variant was pathological because variant caused the stop codon and had a correlation with the disease in in silico programs.",

The prevalence of pathogenic MC4R variants varies between 0.5 and 8.5% of obese adult and pediatric patients [27]. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MC4 gene are also related to obesity and its metabolic complications [28]. Previously, Demiralp D et al. [29] studied MC4R gene polymorphisms in obese Turkish children. In their study, they showed that p.V103I polymorphism was 4.5% in complicated obese children and p.E42K polymorphism was 9% in familial obese children and 1.5% in complicated obese children. De Rosa et al. [30] study 312 African American and Latino children with severe non-syndromic obesity, and their variant rate was 2.6%. In the recent study by Tun\u00e7 et al. [31], MC4R gene variant was investigated in 47 morbid obese children. This study composed of the cases that have the same ethnic origin, and the variant rate was given as 8.5% that is very similar to the present study [28]. Ak\u0131nc\u0131 et al. [32] study 105 patients with severe (BMI > 3) early-onset obesity for 41 previously known obesity-related genes by targeted next-generation sequencing analysis, and they found monogenic obesity of 10.4% in Turkish population. In our study, nucleotide sequence of the coding region of MC4R was determined in 139 unrelated probands with familial early-onset obesity, and 8 (8.6%) probands with variants that alter the amino acid sequence of the receptor were found.",
