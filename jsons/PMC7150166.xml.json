The small bronchi and bronchioles 2 mm in diameter are spread out from the fourth to the fourteenth generation of airway branching [2]. The total airway cross-sectional area expands rapidly beyond the 2 mm airways to provide for rapid diffusion of gas between the distal conducting airways and the gas-exchanging surface. The central conducting airways larger than 2 mm internal diameter are the major site of resistance to airflow in the normal lung because of their much smaller total cross-sectional area 3., 4..",

            "text": "The conducting airways are lined by epithelium and surrounded by an adventitial layer [5]. The submucosa between the epithelium and outer edge of the muscle layer is often referred to as the \u201clamina propria,\u201d but this term is technically incorrect because many airways are not completely surrounded by muscle [6]. Bronchi are defined by the presence of a layer of fibrocartilage external to the smooth muscle and tubuloalveolar glands, which communicate with the airway lumen via ducts [7]. Bronchioles lack both cartilage and glands and become respiratory bronchioles when alveoli open directly into their lumen [7]. The lining of the trachea and major bronchi consists of pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium which gradually becomes more cuboidal with fewer ciliated cells as the alveolar surface is approached 6., 7., 8.. Light microscopy reveals that the basal aspect of airway epithelial cells is attached to a thin basement membrane (80\u201390 nm width) that contains primarily type IV collagen and elastin [9]. Transmission electron microscopy shows that a true basement membrane or basal lamina can be readily distinguished from the connective tissue observed with the light microscope 6., 7.. Quantitative studies 10., 11., 12. have shown that the trachea and mainstem bronchi of normal subjects consist of by volume:\u202230% cartilage;\u202215% mucous glands;\u20225% smooth muscle; and\u202250% connective tissue matrix containing the bronchial arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels.\n",

In the trachea and mainstem bronchi, the airway smooth muscle is located within the posterior membranous sheath, whereas, in the bronchioles, it surrounds the entire lumen of the airway 7., 8., 13.. Consequently, the same degree of muscle shortening has a smaller effect on the caliber of the trachea and central airways than on the distal bronchi and bronchioles [14]. The adventitial layer consists of loose bundles of collagen admixed with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. In the peripheral conducting airways, this layer interacts with the surrounding lung parenchyma through alveolar attachments that are distributed along the circumference of the adventitia. These alveolar attachments have the ability to limit the amount of airway narrowing produced by smooth muscle contraction, particularly at higher lung volumes [14].",

They may originate from the first to the third intercostal artery, from the right internal mammary artery, or from the right subclavian artery 8., 15.. Miller's classic anatomical account [8] showed that two to three arterial branches accompany each of the larger bronchi and that anastomoses between these branches form an arterial plexus in the outer wall of the airway. Small branches of this plexus penetrate the smooth muscle layer to form a capillary network below the epithelium. Short connecting branches extend from this plexus through the muscle layer to form a second plexus of venules along the outer surface of the airway smooth muscle (Fig. 6.2\n). In some species, this outer plexus contains large venous sinuses that can extend into the submucosal layer of the major bronchi, where there is no smooth muscle between the cartilage and epithelium [16].",

Monocytes on the other hand leave the vascular space even in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus and divide in the tissue to form the alveolar macrophages that are removed via the airways with very little if any re-entry into the tissue.

The accumulating lymphocytes form follicles with germinal centers in both the small conducting airways [17] and the parenchyma [18] of the peripheral lung in both COPD 17., 18. and asthma [19]. These accumulations of lymphocytes (Fig. 6.3\n) are part of the bronchial associated lymphoid system or bronchial-alveolar lymphoid tissue (BALT) and differ from the regional lymph nodes in that they have no capsule and no afferent lymphatics. They are similar in structure to the tonsils and adenoids, the Peyers patches in the small bowel, and the appendix of the cecum which are also part of the mucosal immune system. They are organized in the same way as other lymph follicles (Fig. 6.3) in that the B-cells are found in the germinal center of the follicle and the CD4 and CD8 T-cells are located around the edges of the germinal center. Thus dendritic cells migrating from the epithelium and subepithelium circulate through the T- and B-cell rich regions of the follicle and can present antigen to uncommitted T and B lymphocytes moving through these regions in the lymph (Fig. 6.3). Moreover the recirculation of lymphocytes though the follicle and back into the circulation enhances the opportunity for T Helper cells and B-cells that have recognized the same antigen to interact with each other and initiate an adaptive immune response. The appearance of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers in the tissue provides histological evidence that an adaptive immune response has been mounted within the peripheral lung. Some investigators have begun to study this response in detail [18].",

They noted that the pathology consisted of common features that allowed asthma to be distinguished from other conditions. They emphasized the presence of intraluminal mucus secretion, airway epithelial desquamation, and repair (e.g. goblet cell metaplasia), and airway inflammatory infiltrates consisting of an admixture of mononuclear cells and eosinophils and the presence of a thickened, \u201chyalinized\u201d subepithelial basement membrane. Later studies based on electron microscopy and immuno-histochemistry showed that this feature of the basement membrane was due to deposition of collagen fibrils and extracellular matrix below the true basement membrane, rather than thickening of the basal lamina. Huber and Koessler's report noted that the tenacious plugs that fill the airway lumen consist of an exudate of plasma containing inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, mixed with epithelial cells that had sloughed from the airway surface. Using an eyepiece micrometer to measure the external airway diameters, they concluded that the walls of bronchi and bronchioli of more than 2 mm outside diameter were thickened compared with non-asthmatic persons, and that this difference was due to an increased thickness of all of the components of the airway wall.",

Both clones produced IL3 and GMCSF, and interactions between Th-1 and Th2 subtypes allowed one type of clone to inhibit the other. For example, IL-4 is a mast cell growth factor that also stimulates IgE production, and IL-5 promotes the differentiation and survival of eosinophils. Robinson and associates [36] put forward the hypothesis that asthma was the result of a \u201cTh-2 response\u201d based on bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy findings. And subsequent studies of surgically resected lung specimens from asthmatic patients established that a similar inflammatory process was present in the smaller airways [37].",

Moreno and associates [39] calculated that the thickening of the airway wall observed in asthma would have only a minor effect on the caliber of the lumen of a fully dilated airway. However, when the smooth muscle in the airway shortens, the increased tissue between the muscle and lumen causes an excess reduction in airway caliber. Subsequent studies by James et al. [40] showed that the increase in wall thickness observed in the small airways of asthmatics was sufficient to close the lumen of these airways, even when smooth muscle shortening remained within the accepted normal range. This suggests that normal smooth muscle shortening may act in series with an abnormally thickened airway wall to narrow the airway lumen and it follows that the reduction in airway caliber produced by this mechanism would be rapidly reversed when the smooth muscle relaxed. This showed that an important feature of the pathology of asthma was the change in the structure of the airway wall produced by the remodeling of the tissue that occurs in relation to the inflammatory process. The important point is that these structural changes could result in excess airway narrowing with normal smooth muscle contraction and that excessive smooth muscle shortening will enhance the effect of these structural changes on the airway lumen.\n",

Their analysis (Fig. 6.4\n) showed that maximum stimulation of the smooth muscle caused airway resistance to increase and reach a plateau in the normal lung. This finding was consistent with previous observations by Woolcock et al. [43], who reported that the changes in the maximum volume of air that can be expired from the lung in 1 s (FEV1) reached a plateau in normal subjects when maximally stimulated by inhaled bronchoconstrictors. However, when the data on airway structure were changed from normal values to those found in asthmatic lungs, a similar degree of airway smooth shortening resulted in a sustained rapid increase in airway resistance without a plateau. When the effect of disease on the central and peripheral airway function was examined separately, they found that the increase in airway resistance was primarily due to the effect of disease on the peripheral airways, where smooth muscle shortening produced widespread airway closure. The concept that the peripheral airways are the major site of obstruction in asthma has now been confirmed by direct measurements in living asthmatic patients reported by Yanai et al. [44].",

Both Lambert and Wiggs et al. [46] suggested that the mucosal folding pattern was controlled by the stiffness of the subepithelial layer relative to that of the surrounding airway tissue. This analysis suggested that changes in the subepithelial connective tissue might play a key role in determining the pattern of mucosal folding. Lambert and Wiggs et al. argued that the formation of a large number of folds in the normal airway placed a load on the airway smooth muscle that tended to prevent airway closure at low lung volumes. It followed that a change in the mucosal folding pattern in asthma may be one way in which this disease causes peripheral airway dysfunction.",

Exudation of plasma and the secretion of mucus on to the small airway lumen surface should increase surface tension and cause the airways to narrow. The analysis of induced sputum has confirmed that plasma proteins, mucus, and inflammatory cells are present in the airway lumen even in mild asthma, suggesting that some of the abnormalities in airway function of asthmatics might result from the presence of this material in the lumen. Kuyper and colleagues [48] recently re-assessed the importance of the occlusion of the airway lumen by inflammatory exudates in deaths attributed to asthma. By examining the airway wall and luminal content of 275 airways from 93 patients with fatal asthma aged 10\u201349 years. Compared with control airways obtained from persons that died of causes unrelated to the lungs, the asthmatic airways showed much more extensive lumenal occlusion, by mucus and cells. They concluded that widespread airway occlusion was the major cause of death from asthma and death due to closure of empty airways by excessive bronchoconstriction must be a rare event. Moreover the extensive nature of the airway occlusion observed at autopsy in these cases suggests that bronchoconstriction superimposed on airways that have become partially occluded is the most probable cause of sudden death.",

Reid [54] used the relative size of the mucus glands to the airway wall as a yardstick for measuring chronic bronchitis and downplayed the influence of inflammation in driving mucus production. However, a reevaluation of this problem some years later showed that chronic bronchitis was associated with inflammation of the airway mucosal surface, the submucosal glands, and gland ducts, particularly in the smaller bronchi between 2 and 4 mm in diameter [49]. The nature of the inflammatory process present in these airways is now quite well established with several studies reporting that CD8+ lymphocytes are present in excess numbers in smokers with chronic bronchitis 55., 56..",

Comparison of the histological appearance of peripheral airways at different degrees of severity of COPD shows a progressive increase in the magnitude of the inflammatory process with thickening of the airway walls accompanied by occlusion of the airway lumen by inflammatory mucous exudates [17]. However, multivariate analysis of these data indicated that thickening of the airway walls and the occlusion of the lumen by inflammatory exudates containing mucus explained more of the variance in the decline in FEV1 than the infiltration of the airway tissue by any of the inflammatory cell types examined [17]. Interestingly the severity of the occlusion of the airways lumen by inflammatory exudates containing mucus (Fig. 6.6\n) has also associated with premature death in persons with severe (GOLD-3) and very severe (GOLD-4) disease [68].",

This definition emphasizes the destruction of the alveolar surface with a minimal reparative response in the lung matrix and the ability of this destructive process to reduce the gas-exchanging surface of the lung. The centrilobular form of emphysema (Fig. 6.7\n) resulting from dilatation and destruction of the respiratory bronchioles in the center of secondary lobule of Miller has been most closely associated with smoking 80., 82.. The panacinar form of emphysema, on the other hand, results from a uniform destruction of all of the acini in the entire secondary lobule and is characteristic of the lesions found in the lungs in \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency [83]. The terms \u201cdistal acinar,\u201d \u201cmantle,\u201d or \u201cperiseptal\u201d emphysema are used to describe lesions that occur in the periphery of the lobule and along the lobular septae particularly in the subpleural region. These lesions have been associated with spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults and bullous lung disease in older individuals [84]. In far-advanced parenchymal destruction such as that frequently observed in end-stage COPD, these descriptive terms are less helpful because centrilobular disease eventually destroys the entire lung lobule and destroyed lobules can coalesce to form much larger lesions.",

Early studies by Stuart-Harris and associates 87., 88. showed that COPD patients with acute upper respiratory infections are more likely to have signs of infection in the lower airways than normal controls. Probably because acute viral upper respiratory tract infections increase the risk of aspiration of mucoid exudate containing large numbers of bacteria from the upper airways, but also because viral infection reduces both the mucociliary clearance and bacterial killing in the lower airways 89., 90., 91.. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacteria infecting the lower airways during an acute viral infection 90., 91., and these infections account for the positive effect of antibiotics in some exacerbations of COPD [92]. Two important early studies established an association between acute illness and serologic laboratory evidence of viral infection in patients with COPD 93., 94.. The development of polymerized chain reaction (PCR)-based viral diagnostic techniques have improved the sensitivity of the diagnosis of viral infection and the use of real time PCR to measure viral copy numbers will likely improve its specificity. Early reports of studies based on these techniques indicate the importance of rhinoviral infection in causing acute exacerbations in an outpatient setting with influenza A and the corona virus OC-43 being more prominent causes of exacerbations that require admission to hospital 95., 96., 97..",

Emphysematous destruction of the lung surface contributes to the decline in FEV1 by reducing the elastic recoil force available to drive air out of the lung and is responsible for reduced gas exchange.

The structural data from normal lungs were used to obtain the control measurements. These show that airway resistance increases from about 1 cmH2O per liter per second to reach a plateau of 12 cmH2O per liter per second, with maximum contraction of the airways smooth muscle. (A) When the structural features of asthmatic airways were used in the same computer model, the airway resistance continued to increase and did not reach a plateau at any physiologically meaningful value. (B) Data obtained from the model when the structural changes caused by asthma were limited to the central airway (i.e. those >2 mm diameter). Note that asthmatic changes in the central airways increased total resistance and resulted in a plateau slightly greater than the control lungs. (C) However, when the asthmatic changes were placed in the peripheral airway, the resistance increased without reaching a plateau. These data suggest that asthmatic changes in the peripheral airways have a much greater effect on overall airway function than changes that occur in the central airways.",
