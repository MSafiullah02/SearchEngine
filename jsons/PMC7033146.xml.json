            "text": "The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) (also known as the catabolite activator protein, CAP) is a global regulator of gene expression in E. coli and other Gram negative bacteria. CRP regulates more than 500 genes in E. coli by binding to approximately 300 high-affinity sites1. CRP also binds to more than 10000 low-affinity sites in the E. coli genome, indicating that CRP is not only a specific transcriptional regulator, but also a chromosome shaping protein2,3. CRP binds as a dimer to DNA sites, and subsequently with RNA polymerase to activate transcription. This activity is cAMP dependent, with complexation resulting in a conformational transition that converts apoCRP from a low- to a high-affinity DNA binding protein which binds at specific sequences upstream of the promoter4. The structural basis of CRP interactions with cAMP is well understood5. CRP is a homo-dimeric protein with each subunit able to bind one cAMP in a large N-terminal domain that is also responsible for subunit-subunit interactions6,7. A smaller C-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in DNA attachment, with binding generating a strong kink in the DNA chain8. This CRP-DNA binding domain is highly conserved across many bacterial regulatory proteins9,10.",

In the presence of cAMP, and increasing amounts of CRP, a band with lower migration capacity was detected arising from protein binding to the strong symmetric site (Fig. 1A; lanes 2\u20134). Exposure of the cAMP-CRP complex to UV light, before addition to DNA, markedly decreased protein binding to the DNA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2\u20134 with 5\u20137), consistent with UV damage impairing protein binding capacity. Inclusion of the thiol compound dithiothreitol (DTT; Fig. 1A, compare lanes 5\u20137 with 8\u201310) during UV irradiation prevented the inhibition of CRP binding to DNA. In contrast, NaN3 and mannitol did not prevent the inhibition of CRP binding by UV (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 5\u20137 with 11\u201313 and 14\u201316, respectively).",

The absence of O2, compared to normoxia, decreased UV-induced CRP oligomerization and loss of the parent protein band (Supplementary Fig. 1A), consistent with a role for O2-derived intermediates.

            "text": "Experiments were carried out to test whether UV exposure affects DNA integrity (as assessed by denaturing gel electrophoresis) when cAMP-CRP is bound at the strong CRP binding site on the 268 bp DNA fragment. UV exposure of the DNA/CRP/cAMP complex resulted in specific strand cleavage (Fig. 2A, lane 2 and Fig. 2B), which was not observed when DNA alone was exposed to UV light (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and Fig. 2B). Incubation of DNA/CRP/cAMP complexes in the dark did not induce DNA damage (Fig. 2C, lane 2). This CRP- and UV-light dependent cleavage occurs at specific G/C base pairs (Fig. 2D) in one of the half-sites, in the position where a strong kink is generated in the DNA structure on binding of CRP/cAMP17. Omission of cAMP, or denaturing of either the CRP or DNA before irradiation prevented this DNA damage (data not shown). Inclusion of mannitol and NaN3 had no effect on the DNA cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7), consistent with a localized and specific oxidation. In the absence of DTT, (usually present in the CRP binding buffer), both cleavage at the specific G/C pair and limited cleavage at other sites was detected (Fig. 2, lane 6). These data indicate that DNA cleavage occurs via two mechanisms: a highly-specific process in the presence of DTT that involves a cAMP-CRP-derived intermediate that reacts at specific nucleotides, and a less-selective and more limited process in the absence of DTT, that involves diffusible oxidants that can react at multiple sites. Thus, the presence of thiols, as would occur in vivo, limits DNA damage to a highly-specific, UV-driven, process involving cAMP-CRP-derived species.",

This method provided strong evidence for a di-Tyr cross-link between Tyr63 and Tyr41 in a cross-linked peptide (KEMILSYLNQGDFIGELGLFEEGQER) (KAETLYYIVK); this species was not detected in controls. This cross-linked peptide showed the expected \u22122.01 Da mass difference compared to the sum of the parent peptides, and a theoretical mass close to the experimental (4255.143 vs 4255.092 Da; error 11.9 ppm).

MS/MS analysis (Fig. 5B) revealed multiple fragment ions that retain the cross-link site confirming the identification (b9-b12 for the longer \u03b1 peptide; y4 for the shorter \u03b2 peptide). The distance distribution of the atoms forming this cross-link (Fig. 5C,D), are consistent with this being inter-protein (i.e. a cross-link between two chains on different dimer molecules), as the average calculated distances between these residues for a putative intra-chain link is 18.7 \u00c5 (shortest 16.5 \u00c5), for an inter-chain link 34.0 \u00c5 (shortest 31.1 \u00c5), values that are much larger than those over which such cross-links are likely to form (cf. data for zero-link chemical cross-linking reagents19). This conclusion is supported by the surface accessibility of these residues in CRP structures (PDB structures 1o3t, 3hif and 2wc2), and the oligomer formation detected by SDS-PAGE.",

The data presented here indicate that isolated cAMP-CRP is sensitive to biologically-relevant UVB and UVA wavelengths (280\u2013360 nm) and doses, with this generating chemical modifications on specific side-chains, and structural changes (dimer/oligomer formation). Significant UV-induced modification was detected at Met, Trp, Tyr, Pro, Ser and Arg. MS peptide mass mapping indicate that specific Met, Tyr, and Pro residues are modified, with large differences in parent loss and % conversion to products between sites. The extent of modification at individual Trp sites could not be determined, but the overall extent of Trp oxidation was significant, with a proportion of this being NFK and Kyn, together with other uncharacterized materials. Oxidation at Met yielded the sulfoxide, and Tyr oxidation yielded both DOPA and dityrosine. Unusually, significant modification was also detected at Ser and Pro, with these not being typical UV targets. Some of the Ser loss may arise from their proximity to the bound cAMP22. Products from Ser (probably carbonyls) were not detected, as these were not included in the MS modification database. The products from Pro were detected as m/z +16 species, consistent with the formation of alcohols (hydroxyPro23,24).",

            "text": "The binding of CRP to DNA is cAMP dependent, with no gel shift detected in the absence of cAMP. However, UV-induced modification of cAMP-CRP had a marked effect on native cAMP-CRP binding to DNA. It is well established8 that cAMP-CRP binding to DNA is associated with structural changes at the dimer interface, with the monomer units rotating relative to each other (Fig. 4B,C). Interestingly, two of the most heavily modified residues, Met114 and Pro110, are in close proximity both to each other, and to the respective residues on the other monomer, at this interface (Fig. 4B,C). The distance between the imine nitrogen on Pro, and the sulfur on Met calculated as 8.9 \u00c5. Conversion of the Met residue to the sulfoxide, or addition of an OH group to the Pro ring, is predicted to provide significant adverse steric and electronic interactions between these sites, thereby preventing the rotation and structural changes required for binding of cAMP-CRP to DNA. These residues are close to Trp13, with the distance between C2 of Trp13 and imine nitrogen of Pro110 ~5.7 \u00c5 in the non-DNA bound structure. This proximity rationalizes the high extent of modification at these residues. Extensive modification was also detected at these residues when the cAMP-CRP complex was bound to DNA before UV exposure. Oxidation at these same Met and Pro residues in the DNA-bound complex, and their resulting unfavourable interactions, may promote dissociation of the dimer from the DNA and rationalize the decreased binding seen in the gel shift assays (cf. Fig. 1A, lanes 4 versus 7).",

Furthermore, the presence of other materials in the reaction buffers, including DTT, would be expected to remove a large proportion of free-diffusible oxidants. Thus, we propose that the selective damage detected at the dimer interface, and also to the bound DNA chains, arises from the reaction of some of the 1O2 formed at Trp, with the sulfur atoms of Met114 and Met189 to give persulfoxides [-S+(OO\u2212)-]. These are analogues of hydroperoxides, are well-established intermediates in sulfur oxidation by 1O225, and selective oxidants. Reaction of these species with a target results in the formation of Met sulfoxide from the persulfoxide, and oxidation of the target. Such protein-bound, Met-derived persulfoxides formed by 1O2, would therefore rationalize the oxidation at Met114/Pro110 at the dimer interface, and Met189 and the neighbouring G/C bases in the bound DNA.",

Furthermore UV-induced oxidation of the DNA bound complex appears to both promote dissociation of the bound CRP, and induce site-specific cleavage of the bound DNA.

Briefly, after tryptic peptides were digested in H218O- or H216O, they were subjected to solid-phase extraction on activated StageTip C18 reversed-phase discs, and peptides were then dried down (Speedvac concentrator, 3 mins), re-suspended in 10 \u03bcl H218O and H216O water, respectively, and mixed at a 1:1 ratio immediately prior to analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) as described above. Data acquisition was performed either with a universal method characterized by a full MS Orbitrap scan followed by data-dependent high- energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans, or a data-dependent method where a group of signals with mass shifts of 4, 6 and 8 Da are selected for MS/MS. MassAI software (Univ. of Southern Denmark, April 2017) was used to identify and verify cross-linked peptides. The following settings were used: fixed (carbamidomethylation of Cys) and variable (Met, His, and Tyr oxidation) modifications; maximum 2 missed tryptic cleavages; parent mass tolerance 10 ppm; MS/MS peak tolerance 0.02 m/z. Tyr-Tyr, Lys-Tyr, Lys-His, His-His, and Arg-His were selected as potential cross-links.",

Modification at these residues, with conversion of Met114 to the sulfoxide and Pro110 to an alcohol are proposed to result in significant steric and electronic interactions that limit binding of UV-oxidised isolated cAMP-CRP to DNA (cf.

The mass shift between the two envelopes of peaks is diagnostic of the presence of a cross-linked peptide with two new carboxyl termini and the incorporation of four 18O atoms. Panel B: MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of the triply charged di-Tyr cross-linked peptide KEMILSYLNQGDFIGELGLFEEGQER) (KAETLYYIV), with precursor m/z 1419.372. The fragment ions indicated in blue correspond to b and y fragment ions from the (longer) \u03b1 peptide, while the red b and y fragments correspond to the (shorter) \u03b2 peptide. The sequence of these two peptides is indicated, together with the site of the di-Tyr linkage between the two Tyr (Y) residues (vertical green line). A number of the detected fragment ions retain this cross-link confirming its location.

In panel D, these vectors are plotted as distance distributions for a putative intra-chain cross-link (blue bars: average 18.7 \u00c5, 16.5 \u00c5 shortest) and a putative inter-chain cross-link (red bars: average 34.0 \u00c5, shortest 31.1 \u00c5). These high shortest and median distances (>15 \u00c5) imply that the observed cross-links are inter-molecular in nature and occur between monomers in two different dimers. This conclusion is supported by the surface accessibility of the two Tyr residues in both the DNA-free and DNA-bound forms (Supplementary Fig. 3).",
