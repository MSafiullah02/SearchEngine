This step is initiated by the recognition of receptors present on the host cell surface. Receptors can be major determinants of tropism, host range, and pathogenesis. Identifying virus receptors can give clues to these aspects and can lead to the design of intervention strategies. Interfering with receptor recognition is an attractive antiviral therapy, since it occurs before the viral genome has reached the relative safe haven within the cell. This chapter describes the use of an immunoprecipitation approach with Fc-tagged viral spike proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify and characterize the receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This technique can be adapted to identify other viral receptors.",

The presence of a receptor is the principal determinant of cell, tissue and organ tropism, host range, and virulence.

A group of viruses of which many receptors are known are coronaviruses (CoVs). Coronaviruses infect a wide range of avian and mammalian hosts and they are known for their ability to cross the species barrier [ 1 ] . This is exemplifi ed by the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic that was caused by the SARS-CoV [ 2 ] . In 2012, a novel zoonotic CoV was identifi ed from a patient from Saudi Arabia that presented with a severe pneumonia [ 3 ] . This virus belongs to the same genus as SARS-CoV and was named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

            "text": "Although virus receptors can be identifi ed using several methods [ 4 -8 ] , we identifi ed the MERS-CoV receptor using Fc-tagged S1 proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay followed by mass spectrometry [ 9 ] . This assay is basically similar to the method described by Li et al., for the identifi cation of the SARS-CoV receptor [ 10 ] . In this assay, the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV is ligated into a fusion vector to generate an S1-Fc fusion protein, for expression in HEK-293T cells and purifi cation using protein A-sepharose beads. Incubation of the S1-Fc proteins with whole cell lysate of virus-susceptible cells allows the precipitation of the virus receptor with the tagged S1. This complex can then be pulled down from the lysate using protein A-sepharose beads. Subsequently, mass spectrometry is employed to identify candidate protein receptors (Fig. 1 ) . These candidates must be evaluated functionally, which is done using fl ow-cytometric binding assays, infection blocking experiments using antibodies against the candidate receptor, and fi nally by attempting to infect non-susceptible cells that have been transfected with the candidate receptor. This method has been successfully employed for the rapid identifi cation of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV receptor [ 9 , 10 ] and is suitable for identifi cation of protein receptors with reasonable affi nity. Glycan receptors cannot be identifi ed using the described method; treatment of susceptible cells with glycosidases prior to infection can give an insight into the type of viral receptor. Success of the protein receptor pulldown using the S1-Fc as bait depends on the affi nity of S1-receptor interaction. A FACS-based S1-Fc cell-binding assay provides good insight in the strength of this interaction. The FACS-based S1-Fc assay is also instrumental to identify cell lines with high levels of receptor expression that can be used as a source for receptor affi nity-isolation. Alternatively, in the absence of a suitable cell line, homogenates of tissue targeted by the virus can also be used for immunoprecipitation of the receptor. 20. SpeedVac.",
