Exposure to AI viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals. The presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry AI outbreak in North America. These reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to AI viruses. 3. Serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry, domestic swine and human exposure to influenza A viruses, but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals. As such, some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals. Herein, we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild mammals. We call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation, and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are lipid-enveloped viruses with a segmented, negative-sense RNA genome (Webster et al., 1992) . Embedded in the lipid envelope are the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins responsible for virus attachment and release from host cells, respectively (Webster et al., 1992) . Influenza viruses are divided into three types: A, B and C. While influenza B and C viruses are primarily 'human' viruses, influenza A viruses infect a variety of species including birds, humans and other mammals (Webster et al., 1992) . Influenza A viruses are divided further into subtypes based on their HA and NA proteins; 16 HA (H1 -H16) subtypes and 9 NA (N1 -N9) subtypes have been isolated from avian species (Fouchier et al., 2005; Olsen et al., 2006) . Subtypes that are not commonly isolated from humans, swine or horses are often referred to as 'avian influenza' (AI). Most AI viruses circulating through waterfowl are classified as low pathogenic (LPAI; USGS, 2009) . To date, only H5 and H7 subtypes have the potential to become highly pathogenic (HPAI) viruses, which cause high rates of poultry mortality and severe economic loss for poultry producers (Alexander, 2000; USGS, 2009) . While AI has historically been considered an 'avian disease', evidence of AI infection has occasionally been reported in humans, and in a variety of domestic and wild mammalian species. In fact, in a 2002 risk assessment on LPAI H7N2 among commercial poultry farms in western Virginia, USA, the presence of mammalian wildlife was identified as a risk factor for AI infection in poultry (McQuiston et al., 2005) . Most recently, reports of the HPAI H5N1 Asian strain infection in mammals have sparked renewed interest in the potential roles of wild mammals in the ecology of these viruses (USGS, 2009 ).",

            "text": "The first evidence of severe disease in wild mammals attributed to AI infection was documented in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) off the New England coastline during two outbreaks in 1979 and 1983, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of these pinnipeds (Geraci et al., 1982; Hinshaw et al., 1984) . The H7N7 and H4N5 influenza A subtypes were responsible for these outbreaks and were found to be antigenically and genetically similar to avian-derived strains although apparently adapted to these mammals (Geraci et al., 1982; Hinshaw et al., 1984) . AI viruses have continued to be isolated from marine mammals off the New England coast representing H3, H4, H7 and H13 subtypes (Geraci et al., 1982; Hinshaw et al., 1984; Hinshaw et al., 1986; Callan et al., 1995) . While the risk of marine mammals transmitting AI viruses to poultry operations or human populations is undoubtedly minimal, other wild mammals may form better links between infected wild waterfowl, poultry and/or humans. For example, evidence of AI infection has been reported in species of the mammalian families Mustelidae, Procyonidae, Sciuridae, Viverridae, Canidae, Felidae and Suidae. The home ranges of many of the species in these mammalian families may include habitats of wild birds and domestic farms or urban areas (Merrill, 1962; Dunstone & Ireland, 1989; Zeiner et al., 1990; Lanski, 2003; Cleary & Craven, 2005; Wyckoff et al., 2005) .",

Experimentally, mink are highly susceptible to LPAI viruses by intranasal inoculation (Matsuura, Yanagawa & Noda, 1979) and by contact with other infected mink (Yagyu et al., 1981; Okazaki, Yanagawa & Kida, 1983) . Virus was isolated from mink nasal swabs for up to 11 days post-inoculation (dpi; Yagyu et al., 1981) . Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are also susceptible to LPAI infection via intranasal inoculation or ingestion of infectious chicken eggs, and shed virus from their trachea and intestines for up to 8 dpi (Bailey, 1983) . More recently, a report of stone marten (Martes foina) susceptibility to HPAI H5N1 infection after presumably feeding on an infected bird carcass has been published (WHO, 2006a) . The combination of AI virus susceptibility and habitat, which often includes poultry farms or human settlements (Merrill, 1962; Dunstone & Ireland, 1989; Lanski, 2003) , illustrates the potential risk of AI transmission by mustelids to humans and poultry.",

Originally, the idea of raccoons (Procyon lotor) and 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) as potential transmitters of AI viruses was evaluated in experimental infections which resulted in AI positive trachea aspirates from 13-lined ground squirrels for up to 9 dpi and the seroconversion of a single raccoon (Bailey, 1983) . A recent experimental infection has shown that raccoons infected with LPAI H4N8 are capable of shedding low levels of virus for several days, and may be able to transmit the virus to nearby raccoons through aerosol transmission (Hall et al., 2008a) . A concurrent serological survey reported evidence of LPAI infection in raccoons trapped in three US states: Wyoming, Colorado and Maryland (Hall et al., 2008a) . Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) frequent rural and urban habitats (Reperant et al., 2008) and their proximity to humans has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for tick-borne encephalitis outbreaks in humans (Haemig et al., 2008) . Their proximity to humans has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for tickborne encephalitis outbreaks in humans (Haemig et al., 2008) . To assess their potential roles in AI transmission, red foxes were experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1. Foxes, which were inoculated intratracheally, excreted virus for 3-7 dpi and developed severe pneumonia, myocarditis and encephalitis (Reperant et al., 2008) . However, foxes that were fed infected bird carcasses also shed virus for 3-5 days but developed only mild signs of disease; this may allow them to play a role in virus dispersal (Reperant et al., 2008) .",

While the source of infection is unknown, poultry deaths were reported in villages adjacent to the park and the civet enclosures were not rodent-proof or roofed (Roberton et al., 2006) . Because civets are hunted and often traded at live-animal markets, they may have the potential to spread pathogens to other animals or humans (Webster, 2004) .

The first incidence of domestic cats (Felis catus) becoming infected with avian derived HPAI H5N1 also occurred in Thailand in 2004; 14 of 15 cats from one household died after one cat had consumed a chicken carcass on a farm where a HPAI H5N1 outbreak occurred (Kuiken et al., 2006) . Contact transmission of HPAI H5N1 from infected swans, ducks and chickens to domestic cats has also been documented (Leschnik et al., 2007) . Considering the common occurrence of domestic and feral cats on farms, the increased encroachment of humans and livestock on large wild cat territories (Sekhar, 1998) , and the susceptibility of felids to HPAI H5N1 infection, it is possible that these animals could play a role in AI virus transmission to farms or other human settlements.",

As with domestic cats, domestic swine can escape from farms and give rise to feral populations in many parts of the world. Feral swine often share habitats with waterfowl and frequently come into contact with domestic swine and humans (Wyckoff et al., 2005) . Although experimental inoculations and AI exposure have yet to be reported in feral swine (Hall et al., 2008b) , it seems probable that feral swine are just as susceptible to a wide variety of AI viruses as their domestic counterparts; they may therefore play a role in AI virus transmission from wild populations to domestic farms.",

            "text": "To understand better the roles of wild or feral mammals in the transmission of AI viruses, a logical first step is to conduct surveillance studies for evidence of AI virus exposure in a diversity of species. In some studies, animals are surveyed for current AI infection by testing tissues, swabs or environmental samples for the presence of AI viruses; common tests include virus isolation in chicken embryos and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (USGS, 2008) . While surveying for active infections only provides current information, serological surveillance, in which blood serum is tested for the presence of antibodies to a past infection, can be used to identify any past exposure to influenza viruses. These data can then be used to estimate the proportion of individual animals or populations that have ever been exposed. Certain serological tests are used to screen serum samples and identify exposure to any influenza A virus; these include agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). However, researchers often want to know the exact influenza subtype to which an animal was exposed. Common subtype-specific assays include hemagglutination-inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN) and microneutralization (MN) tests, and single radial haemolysis (SRH) assays. Because so many serological assays exist for influenza testing in humans and domestic animals, wildlife researchers may be quick to use them for wild mammal testing as well. However, immune responses are often pathogendependent and can vary between species (Davis & Hamilton, 1998) ; a protocol that works for mammal-derived influenza A viruses may not work with avian-derived viruses, and an assay that has high sensitivity and specificity when testing for antibodies from one species may not be reliable when testing for antibodies from other species. Here, we review these traditional assays and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild and feral mammals by addressing the question: do assays developed for detecting influenza A-specific antibodies in humans and/or domestic fowl adequately detect AI-specific antibodies in wild mammals?",

All influenza A viruses have antigenically similar nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Concentrated virus preparations containing either or both of these antigens are used in the AGID test. The antigen preparation is added to a centre well in an agar-gel matrix and the positive control sera and poultry test sera are added to surrounding wells. The agar plates are incubated overnight and if a serum sample is positive for antibodies to influenza A viruses, a precipitation line will generally form where the antigen and antibodies meet. However, not all species produce precipitating antibodies. For example, some avian species do not form precipitins to various antigens (Toth & Norcross, 1981; Higgins, 1989) . While the AGID is a standard test in the poultry industry, it has not been validated for the use with any species other than domestic chickens and turkeys (OIE, 2008) .",

Known subtypes of influenza viruses are mixed with serum samples and then added to chicken RBCs (OIE, 2008) . If the serum in question contains antibodies specific to that influenza subtype, then the antibodies will bind to the virus and prevent the virus from agglutinating the RBCs. An HI titer is assigned based on the last dilution of sera that prevents hemagglutination. With the HI test, the HA subtype and antibody titer can be determined, although titers may differ slightly between laboratories. Originally, it was hypothesized that AI viruses do not induce a humoral (antibody) response in mammals, because antibody detection in AI-infected ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) was found to be lower than that in ferrets infected with mammalian-derived strains of influenza A virus (Hinshaw et al., 1981) . However, subsequent AI studies conducted on ferrets, ducks, pigs and mice suggested that the failure to detect mammalian antibodies specific to AI viruses was actually due to problems with the HI test (Lu, Webster & Hinshaw, 1982; Kida et al., 1994; Ninomiya et al., 2002) . While mammalian antibodies to AI viruses frequently did not inhibit hemagglutination of homologous avian-derived virions, these antibodies did inhibit hemagglutination of viral subunit antigens and/or mammalian-derived viruses of the same subtype (Lu, Webster & Hinshaw, 1982) . More recently, the HI test has been improved for detecting antibodies against AI viruses in humans by using horse RBCs in the assay (Stephenson et al., 2003 (Stephenson et al., , 2004 Puzelli et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006; Meijer et al., 2006; Traenor et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2008) . Horse erythrocytes contain almost exclusively SAa2,3-Gal linkages (the cellular binding sites of AI viruses), whereas the traditionally used chicken or turkey RBCs contain a mixture of SAa2,6-Gal (the cellular binding sites for human-derived influenza viruses) and SAa2,3-Gal linkages (Stephenson et al., 2003) . While the horse-RBC HI test has worked well for testing selected mammalian sera for most AI subtypes, problems in identifying exposure to the H7 subtype still have not been resolved (WHO, 2006b; Kayali et al., 2008) .",

In influenza testing, the VN test detects subtype specific circulating antibodies directed against the HA antigen (Stephenson et al., 2007) . Briefly, infectious virus of a known subtype is combined with serum samples, allowed to incubate and added to a cell monolayer (usually MDCK cells) for 3-4 days. Results are often expressed as a titer based on cytopathic effect in the monolayer caused by viral infection. The MN test is a variation of the VN assay performed in microtiter plates with 'next day' results expressed as a titer based on an enzymatic reaction. The MN assay can therefore accommodate more samples at once and produce more timely results (Okuno et al., 1990; Rowe et al., 1999) . Although considered equally (or more) sensitive and strain-specific as the horse RBC HI tests, VN and MN titers can also differ slightly between laboratories (Stephenson et al., 2007; Kayali et al., 2008; Wood, 2008) . Inter-laboratory differences in sera preparation, quantity of virus added, neutralization time and dilution may all contribute to variability (Stephenson et al., 2007) .

Influenza virus particles are attached to the surface of RBCs and combined with a source of complement (serum proteins that aid in immune response) and agar in a Petri dish. After the gel has cooled, heat inactivated serum samples are added to wells. As plates are incubated, antibody from serum samples diffuses from the wells into the gel at a rate proportional to the concentration of antibodies. HA-specific antibodies attach to a homologous virus-RBC complex causing complement mediated hemolysis as it diffuses through the gel. The size of the resulting zone of hemolysis is proportional to the amount of HA-specific antibody contained in the test samples. The SRH test has sensitivity equivalent to the VN and horse RBC HI tests for detecting H5-specific antibodies in human sera (Stephenson et al., 2003) .

Because of their susceptibility to AI infection and their potential contact with domestic animals and/or humans (e.g. through overlapping habitats or feeding behaviours, or via 'wet-markets' where livestock are sold alive), certain wild mammal species may be capable of transmitting AI Avian influenza in wild mammals 173 viruses between wild waterfowl and domestic animals or humans (Clark & Hall, 2006) . Increased interest in the role of wild mammals in influenza ecology has led to wildlife biologists entering the field once occupied only by poultry producers, human and veterinary diagnosticians, and primary influenza research laboratories. Studies are already underway to characterize seroprevalences in some wild mammalian species (Hall et al., 2008a,b; Marschall et al., 2008) . While there is a need for these studies, researchers must choose diagnostic tests carefully to avoid underreporting influenza virus exposure. Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages, potential pitfalls and necessary protocol adjustments when using traditional serological tests for wild mammal seroprevalence studies. However, even with protocol adjustments, a WHO working group on influenza research has expressed concern that some human seroprevalence studies may still be reporting false-negative H5 and H7 results due to possible limitations and variability of serological tests (WHO, 2006b) .",
