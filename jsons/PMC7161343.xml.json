In Italy, the lethality rate is 9%, which peaks in Lombardy (>10%), whereas the lethality rate in Wuhan was 5.8% and remained <1% in the rest of the People's Republic of China4. An initial rationale for the higher lethality rate could be the high average age of the Italian population when compared to, for example, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea; in the latter, the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases are young women (62%), with 30% of positive cases in the age range of 20\u201330 years. The average age of those dying in Italy is 79 years, and more than 70% were men1.",

            "text": "Another explanation for the higher lethality is the presence of other pathologies and the comorbidities of the elderly population. Based on research by the WHO, a Report of the WHO China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019, published in February 2020, reported that patients without other comorbidities have mortality rates of 1.4%, compared to COVID-19 patients with other diseases that compromise their health condition and result in higher mortality rates, which were 13, 9, and 7.6% for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, respectively5. In Italy, data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) indicates that 1% of the patients who died had no other disease, 26% had 1 disease, 26% had 2 disease, and 47% had 3 or more conditions. The most common chronic preexisting disease in the patients who died was arterial hypertension (76%), followed by ischemic heart disease (37%), atrial fibrillation (26%), and active cancer within the previous 5 years (19%)4.",

            "text": "Another cause for the higher lethality rate may be that Italy had a higher number of infected individuals who were asymptomatic and infected others. As recently reported by Li et al., the transmission rate from unreported infections was 55% of the rate of reported infections, and un- reported infections resulted in 79% of reported cases (1). Therefore, for each positive COVID-19 case, there are ~8\u201310 undetected cases; thus, the actual number of COVID-19 cases could be up to 10 times higher, and recalculation of the mortality rates on this basis would cause the actual national mortality rate of COVID-19 to decrease approximately to the mortality rates of COVID-19 in the People's Republic of China.",
