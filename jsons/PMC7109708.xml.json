Further toxicological studies on ATA are therefore necessary.

Commercially available ATA is actually a heterogeneous mixture of polymers of the phenol formaldehyde type.17 In addition, it is known that ATA readily polymerizes and that its biological activity varies with the molecular weight.8 A study on the effect of ATA fractions on nuclear swelling and on in vitro RNA and DNA synthesis even found that significant biological activity can be attributed to formaurindicarboxylic acid, an impurity found in commercial preparations of ATA, whereas pure ATA was found to be almost inactive.18",
