Currently, there is no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease. In the absence of a specific treatment for this novel virus, there is an urgent need to find an alternative solution to prevent and control the replication and spread of the virus. We have done an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords of SARS, MERS, and coronaviruses. We summarize and propose therapeutic options available for the treatment of this novel coronaviruses.",

There are three active forms of vitamin A in the body, retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid. Vitamin A is also called \u201canti\u2010infective\u201d vitamin and many of the body's defenses against infection depend on an adequate supply. Researchers have believed that an impaired immune response is due to the deficiency of a particular nutritional element.\n10\n Vitamin A deficiency is strongly involved in measles and diarrhea\n11\n and measles can become severe in vitamin A\u2010deficient children. In addition, Semba et al\n12\n had reported that vitamin A supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles\u2010related pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malaria. Vitamin A supplementation also offers some protection against the complications of other life\u2010threatening infections, including malaria, lung diseases, and HIV.\n13\n Jee et al\n14\n had reported that low vitamin A diets might compromise the effectiveness of inactivated bovine coronavirus vaccines and render calves more susceptible to infectious disease. The effect of infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a kind of coronaviruses, was more pronounced in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin A.\n15\n The mechanism by which vitamin A and retinoids inhibit measles replication is upregulating elements of the innate immune response in uninfected bystander cells, making them refractory to productive infection during subsequent rounds of viral replication.\n16\n Therefore, vitamin A could be a promising option for the treatment of this novel coronavirus and the prevention of lung infection.",

For example, vitamin B2 (riboflavin) plays a role in the energy metabolism of all cells. Vitamin B2 deficiency had been suspected to occur among US elderly.\n17\n Keil et al\n18\n had reported that vitamin B2 and UV light effectively reduced the titer of MERS\u2010CoV in human plasma products. Vitamin B3, also called nicotinamide, could enhance the killing of Staphylococcus aureus through a myeloid\u2010specific transcription factor and vitamin B3 was efficacious in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings.\n19\n Moreover, vitamin B3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs with a strong anti\u2010inflammatory effect during ventilator\u2010induced lung injury. However, it also paradoxically led to the development of significant hypoxemia.\n20\n Vitamin B6 is also needed in protein metabolism and it participates in over 100 reactions in body tissues. In addition, it also plays important role in body immune function as well. As shortage of B vitamins may weaken host immune response, they should be supplemented to the virus\u2010infected patients to enhance their immune system.
