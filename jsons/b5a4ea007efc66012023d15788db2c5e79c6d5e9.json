FOCUS(Ben-Zeev et al., 2019) from Dr. Dror Ben-Zeev, and PRIME(Schlosser et al., 2018) from Dr. Danielle Schlosser, Intellicare from Dr. David Mohr(Mohr et al., 2017), and CBT2Go(Depp et al., 2019) from Dr. Colin Depp as just some examples of mobile health tools for SMI. Using digital phenotyping and smartphone surveys/sensors to better monitor patients' real time, longitudinal, and dynamic experience of mental health is feasible with apps like mindLAMP from our group, Cross Check from Dr. John Kane(Ben-Zeev et al., 2017) and many others like the MONARCHA by Dr. Jakob Bardram plus many more (Bardram and Mati, 2020) These smartphone digital data streams can be used predict relapse(Barnett et al., 2018), and create personalized care plans responsive to the psychological and social environments of patients. Many commercial apps like Stop Breath and Think(Athanas et al., 2019) offer provide realtime interventions for anxiety that can be of help in addressing the widespread anxiety reactions generated by Covid-19 like crises. The United States Department of Veterans' Affairs offers a library of free mental health apps for anyone to use and benefit from.
