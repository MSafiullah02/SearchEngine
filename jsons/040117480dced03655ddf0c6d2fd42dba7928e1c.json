NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related with schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is known to increase glutamatergic transmission. Thus, we hypothesized that LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma crossfrequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.",

Dysfunctional connectivity within HPC-PFC circuits is associated with the pathophysiology and genetic predisposition of schizophrenia [3] [4] [5] . In schizophrenia, HPC-PFC connectivity is decreased during working memory tasks and increased in resting state [5] [6] [7] . Such effects may be mediated, at least in part, by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr). In fact, NMDAr binding is reduced in schizophrenic patients in both HPC and PFC, and administration of an NMDAr antagonist, such as ketamine, can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy patients and an increase in resting state HPC-PFC connectivity [8] [9] [10] . This NMDAr hypofunction also affects synaptic plasticity, inducing impairments in critical circuits, such as HPC-PFC, promoting cognitive symptoms by pathologic neural activity [11] [12] [13] . However, the relationship between synaptic plasticity in HPC-PFC circuits and schizophrenia is not fully understood.",

The allosteric modulation of NMDAr reverts working memory deficit induced by ketamine and is capable of increasing NMDAr function in PFC 22, 23 . Consistently, clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to increase NMDAr currents, both by inhibiting type-A glycine transporter and binding to glycine-site NMDAr 19, 24 . Furthermore, clozapine is also capable of preventing ketamine impairment on LTP induction of the HPC-PFC pathway 18, 25 . Regarding AMPAr, its positive allosteric modulation reversed impairments in HPC-PFC short-term synaptic plasticity and increase delta oscillation in the PFC 26 . Although the clinical antipsychotic effects of allosteric modulation in glutamatergic receptors are not conclusive 27, 28 , it is known that induction of synaptic plasticity increases AMPAr availability and NMDAr efficiency, which could revert NMDAr antagonist impairments 29, 30 . Assuming that (1) NMDAr antagonists affect synaptic plasticity 16-18,31-33 ; (2) allosteric modulation of glutamatergic receptors prevents psychotic-like effects, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] and (3) induction of LTP modulates both AMPAr and NMDAr activity [34] [35] [36] ; we hypothesized that a previous increase of glutamatergic efficiency by LTP induction can preclude NMDAr antagonist effects on HPC-PFC pathway.",

We first, classified basal brain state oscillations and then compared PFC field responses induced by HPC stimulation and HPC-PFC oscillatory coupling before and after ketamine treatment. Then we tested the modulatory effect of deep brain stimulation (LTP at HPC-PFC synapses) on ketamine-driven oscillatory patterns. Our findings show that ketamine induces a state of increased gamma frequency power and abnormal cross-frequency coupling in the PFC, followed by an enhancement of HPC-PFC evoked responses. Although LTP induction also increases gamma frequency activity, it prevented ketamine-induced aberrant oscillatory coupling and potentiation of HPC-PFC synaptic transmission. Our data suggests that modulation of synaptic plasticity in HPC-PFC circuits might be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent dysfunctions induced by NMDAr blockade.",

We show that while DEA epochs show synchrony in delta rhythms, spectral coherence during ACT state demonstrates a peak in theta oscillations (4 Hz, Figure 2A ). These patterns of synchronicity closely follow alternation of brain states ( Figure 2A ). We further explored state connectivity by performing cross-correlation and Granger causality analyses. In Figure 2B we show that the peak of crosscorrelation in delta frequency (predominant oscillation on DEA epochs) have a positive lag (2 ms), while theta oscillations indicate a negative lag (-22 ms). Granger analysis reveal that ACT periods show theta oscillations with the HPC leading the PFC (t (7) =2.4909, p=0.0415), while on DEA epochs we found a peak in delta oscillations (~1.5 Hz) with the PFC driving the HPC oscillations (t (7) =7.7401, p=0.0001). These results suggest that during ACT states hippocampal theta coordinates activity in the PFC, while in DEA periods delta oscillations from the PFC coordinates HPC slow activity. We also explored phase-amplitude coupling on each state. We found a prominent coupling of the delta phase with high-gamma amplitude during DEA oscillatory activity in the PFC ( Figure  2C ). This coupling was significantly higher than a uniform empirical distribution (shuffled surrogate data) and the one present in ACT epochs (Kruskal-Wallis test: H (3) =16.81, p=0.0002, Dunn's post-hoc test p=0.0002 for DEA vs. ACT and p=0.0157 DEA vs. Surrogate data; Figure  2C ). Comodulation maps did not reveal a clear cross-frequency coupling (CFC) during ACT states (data not shown).",

We show that NMDAr blockade leads to an increase in evoked field post-synaptic potential (fPSP) amplitude (F (20, 260) =1.611 significant interaction between groups p=0.050; Bonferroni post-hoc test are bottom of the graphs) and a robust reduction of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) ( F (20, 260) =8.205 significant interaction between groups p =<0,001). Figure 3C shows a representative raw LFP from both regions indicating ketamine effects on brain oscillations. As described in other studies 17, 33, 39 , we verified that NMDAr blockade increased low-gamma and high-gamma power in the PFC independent of brain state (DEA: low-gamma: t (6) =2.327, p=0.0589; high-gamma: t (6) =3.423, p=0.0141; ACT: low-gamma: t (5) =4.108, p=0.0093; high-gamma: t (5) =3.258, p=0.0225; Figure 3D ). In PFC, no significant effects were observed in other frequency bands, while in HPC there is a slightly increase in gamma power ( Figure S1A ). Interestingly, systemic ketamine appears to increase the probability of DEA state. In figure 3E we demonstrate the probability density function of DEA epoch occurrence in all animals in the KET group compared with animals of the SAL group. While the probability of SAL group oscillates between low and high values during the recording, this oscillation pattern is reduced after ketamine injection, with the probability of a DEA epoch occurrence kept high for at least 30 min after systemic injection (see also Figure S2 ). This increase in DEA oscillatory activity is not accompanied by alterations in synchrony between the HPC-PFC LFP accounting for epoch separation. As we show in figure 3F there are no significant changes between spectral coherence of DEA or ACT states comparing before or after ketamine injection. However, as shown in a representative coherogram, systemic ketamine leads to a persistent synchronization in delta, which follows the increase in DEA epochs.",

In figure 3G we represent high-gamma amplitude as a function of delta phase comparing DEA epochs before and after ketamine injection. We show here that NMDAr blockade increases cross-frequency coupling between delta and high-gamma activity (t (6) =4.947, p=0.0026). To investigate if the increase of the CFC was dependent on power changes promoted by ketamine we performed a linear correlation between DEA baseline-normalized MI and delta or high-gamma power values. Figure 3H shows a weak correlation between delta or high-gamma with MI values after ketamine injection (r=0.09 for delta and r=0.22 for high-gamma). To further investigate if increase in CFC could be influenced by high-gamma power after ketamine we compared MI averaged values before and after the drug. For this, we only used post-ketamine epochs with high-gamma within 95% confidence interval of the pre-ketamine high-gamma distribution. We show that even epochs with no increase in high-gamma values compared to baseline present an average significant enhancement in CFC ( Figure 3H right; t (882) =8.0693, p<0.001), indicating that ketamine effects in delta-high-gamma coupling may be independent of power increase in these frequencies. We confirmed this result with bootstrap analysis using 1000 repetitions and controlling for the number of trials. These data indicate that ketamine promotes an oscillatory state that is different from the traditional DEA state in the PFC. Figure 3I illustrates all the 20s DEA epochs from the KET group in a 3D plot showing how ketamine modify brain oscillatory activity in DEA epochs increasing gamma frequency band and delta-high-gamma coupling.",

LTP effects were also seen in the amplitude of the fPSP2 (paired pulse stimulation; F (20,240) =11.470, p<0.0001). However, the increase in the fPSP2 is relatively lower than the one in fPSP1, which is seen as a reduction in the PPF ratio at least for 60 min after HFS (F (20, 240) =5.621, p<0.0001; Figure 4B ). Figure 4C demonstrates the effects of HFS on LFP of the PFC. LTP induction produced an increase in low and high-gamma on the PFC restricted to DEA epochs (low-gamma: Mann-Whitney test, U=30, p=0.0006; high-gamma: Mann-Whitney test, U=27, p=0.0003). No significant alterations were observed at gamma frequencies in the HPC of LTP groups ( Figure S1B ). Interestingly, the increase in high-gamma power was not related to an enhancement of delta-high-gamma coupling. As shown in figure 4D modulation index did not differ from before or after LTP induction (p>0.05).",

Similar to what we observed in the LTP-SAL group, LTP-KET also presented an increase in low and high-gamma activity in the DEA epochs of the PFC (low-gamma: t (7) =2.229, p=0.0611; high-gamma: t (7) =2.931, p=0.0220).

We used principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction of electrophysiological features, and then applied a quadratic discriminant analysis to classify epochs in the two groups. For the quadratic function we used the first three principal components, which have an explained variance of 79.21% ( Figure 5C ). Our classification model with training data (filled circles) and then cross-validated with test data (open triangles) gave a classification accuracy of 85.56% accuracy. This data show that ketamine effects can be distinguished when preceded by LTP based on their electrophysiological characteristics. We next compared the epochs mean score from each group for the first three principal component ( Figure 5D ). Our results revealed that KET has a higher score on PC1 (p<0.0001), while LTP-KET has a higher score in PC2 (p=0.0069) and PC3 (p=0.0001). Interpreting the correlation coefficients (loadings) of the original variables with the first three principal components we observe that PC1 has a high correlation with CFC values (r=0.7696, p<0.0001), high-gamma (r=0.5975, p<0.0001) and delta activity (r=0.8963, p=0.0001). PC2 and PC3 have high correlation with theta (r=0.8368, p<0.0001) and high-gamma (r=0.6750, p<0.0001), respectively, and negative correlation with fPSP (r=-0.5214, p<0.0001 and r=-0.5375, p<0.0001, respectively).",

A variety of in vivo studies have demonstrated that non-competitive NMDAr antagonism increases the firing rate of PFC pyramidal neurons reducing their synchrony, and enhancing broadband gamma activity 33, [46] [47] [48] [49] . This broadband gamma enhancement is thought of as an aberrant and diffuse noise at the network level that can cause dysfunction in cognitive and sensory-motor integration 17, 50 . In our study, gamma increase after KET injection was robust in the PFC, with subtle effects in the HPC (see also Figure S1A ). Robust gamma increases have been previously reported in the HPC following NMDAr antagonism in freely moving 51, 52 and anesthetized animals 17 as well. To our knowledge, none of these studies tested the effects of S+ ketamine, which has a higher affinity to NMDAr compared to racemic ketamine 53 . Indeed, different NMDAr antagonists are known to produce different effects on gamma oscillatory dynamics 46, 54, 55 .",

            "text": "Interestingly, we show that in DEA states, the increase in high-gamma activity induced by ketamine is strongly coordinated by slow oscillations, rather than by a generalized increase of activity. We suggest that this rhythmic coupling is independent of enhancement in gamma activity since there was low correlation between gamma power and CFC. Post-ketamine epochs of similar gamma power to pre-ketamine showed significantly higher delta-gamma coupling. Indeed, it was previously shown that ketamine could affect CFC between theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of freely moving rats 51 . In contrast, delta-gamma CFC has been described in corticostriatal network and could reflect cortico-mesolimbic connectivity 55 , induced in frontal regions by anesthetic doses of ketamine 56 and modulated by dopaminergic activation 57, 58 . One possible mechanism by which KET produces an enhancement in CFC is by increasing extracellular levels of dopamine. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that racemic ketamine promotes dopamine release in PFC of rats 59 and that S+ KET strongly inhibits dopamine transporter 60 26 . They also noticed that changes in PPF occurred following systemic or mediodorsal thalamic nucleus microinjections, but not following injection into the PFC. This suggests that NMDAr antagonism could exert part of its effects by acting on thalamic nuclei. Given the critical role of the thalamus in integrating and regulating sensory information to the cortex, and the ability of short-term synaptic plasticity to influence information processing, it is plausible that dysfunctional sensory/cognitive processing in schizophrenia may arise from modified short-term synaptic plasticity [62] [63] [64] Another finding of the present study was that LTP induction in the HPC-PFC projections abolished ketamine reduction of PPF. Classically, PPF arises from calcium accumulation in the presynaptic terminal due to a first stimulation pulse that results in increased neurotransmitter release in response to a second stimulus followed by a short interval 30 . However, short-term synaptic plasticity in the HPC-PFC pathway may encompass a more complex interaction, involving GABAergic interneurons terminating in the PFC pyramidal cells, since CA1 collaterals innervate both pyramidal and GABAergic neurons 67 . Electrical stimulation of CA1 induces a relevant burst activity in PFC interneurons in contrast to the few spikes elicited in pyramidal neurons 68 . This feed-forward inhibition is proposed to constrain the excitatory influence of the HPC on PFC pyramidal cells, supporting rhythmic synchronization between the hippocampus and cortical activity 68 . It is possible that PPF deficits induced by NMDAr antagonism could contribute to a reduced synchrony between HPC and PFC and LTP induction could attenuate this effect. Also, the decrease in HPC-PFC pathway PPF response is related to an increase of delta activity in the 0.5-2 Hz band 26 . Interestingly, we show that ketamine produced an increase in the number of deactivated epochs that are characterized by ~1Hz power. In contrast, LTP induction prevented this effect on brain state alternation, which could explain the reduction of KET effects on PPF.",

Supporting this idea, microinjection of the NMDAr competitive antagonist, AP5 abolished both MK-801 and tetanus stimulation effects on cortical fPSP 32 . In another study, a low dose of ketamine reduced the LTP magnitude induced by ventral CA1 stimulation, an effect that was prevented by clozapine administration 18 .

This effect is consistent with previous reports that show gamma increase in the posterior HPC-PFC pathway following LTP, but no LTD 70 . However, we did not observe enhanced CFC following gamma increase. These findings suggest that in contrast to KET, LTP promotes less coordinated gamma oscillations during slow delta activity. Furthermore, HFS attenuated aberrant delta-high-gamma CFC during DEA epochs. As described, the efficacy of this stimulation in preventing ketamine effects could be related to an increase of AMPAr and NMDAr functions in PFC interneurons 68, 71 . However, we cannot discard the contribution of other regions and modulatory systems. For instance, it is wellknown that HFS delivery to the HPC causes dopamine release in the PFC 72 . Given the possibility that KET increases CFC coupling in delta range increasing dopaminergic activity, future experiments modulating dopaminergic receptors in the PFC during LTP and NMDAr antagonist administration would be elucidative.",

It remains an open question, however, whether LTP induction would also attenuate functional and behavioral deficits induced by ketamine. Indirect supporting evidence can be obtained from reports using allosteric modulators of NMDAr or AMPAr. Application of LY451395, an AMPA positive allosteric modulator, reverts the increase in slow oscillations and PPF deficits produced by MK-801 26 . Inhibitors of glycine transporter were able to revert the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in rodents and in healthy humans 24, 73 . Nevertheless, blocking glycine reuptake in patients with schizophrenia by using bitopertin, did not improve their cognitive and negative symptoms 27, 28 . Direct support, on the other hand, comes from experimental deep brain stimulation (DBS) studies. High-frequency stimulation of the ventral HPC was shown to normalize auditory evoked responses in the MAM model of schizophrenia 74 . Using the same animal model, Perez et al. 2013 showed that ventral hippocampal DBS: (1) normalized aberrant dopamine neuron activity, (2) decreased locomotor response to amphetamine, and (3) restored deficits of cognitive flexibility 75 . Furthermore, the application of DBS to other cerebral regions, such as PFC, nucleus accumbens 76, 77 , and the medial septum 76 showed promising results for alleviating behavioral deficits in animal models of schizophrenia. Taken together, these data suggest that HFS of limbic circuits should be further investigated as a possible treatment for drug-resistant schizophrenia.",

Additional studies are needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of this interference induced by this form of deep brain stimulation.

The stimulus electrode in HPC was adjusted by applying low-intensity test-pulses (square monophasic pulses, ~150 \u00b5A 200 \u00b5s, 0.05 Hz) aiming for a consistent fPSP in the PFC (i.e., the latency of first negative peak of 14-17 ms and amplitude>0.25 mV 78, 79 . After electrode adjustment, an input-output curve (I/O curve; 60-500 \u00b5A) was used to establish the current intensity necessary to evoke 70% of the maximal fPSP amplitude. This current was used to apply paired monophasic pulses (same parameters as in test pulses and 80 ms of inter-pulse interval; S88; Grass Instruments) during the entire experiment. Recorded signals consisted of evoked fPSP and concomitant LFPs of PFC and HPC ( Figure 1C) . Signal was amplified 100x, band-pass filtered (0.3-1000 Hz; Grass), and digitized at 10 kHz (ADInstruments). LTP induction was induced by applying a high-frequency stimulation (HFS): two series of 10 trains (50 pulses at 250 Hz every 10 s) separated by 10 min. Figure 1B illustrate the experimental design. In Experiment 1 we investigated the ketamine effects on HPC-PFC connectivity. fPSPs and LFPs were monitored for 120 min after ketamine (S(+)ketamine; 12.5 mg/Kg ip) or saline (0.9 %) injection and compared with the 90 min baseline (groups KET, n=7 and SAL, n=8, respectively). We choose S(+)-ketamine given its high affinity for NMDAr 53 and because it reproduces the metabolic effects observed in psychotic patients 80 . In Experiment 2 we explored the hypothesis that LTP induction could prevent ketamine effects on the HPC-PFC connectivity. After a 30 min baseline, two HFS protocols were applied at 30 and 60 min. Following HFS, ketamine or saline was injected and field potentials were monitored for an additional 120 min (groups LTP-KET, n=9 and LTP-SAL, n=6, respectively).

The magnitude squared coherence was calculated as: Cxy(f) = |Pxy(f)| 2 / Pyy(f) Pxx(f). The parameters used were the same as described for the PSDs estimate. Coherograms were calculated using the same approach while using a moving window of 90 s and 50% overlap. Power and coherence values from 58 -62 Hz (line noise contamination) were removed from the analysis. To evaluate HFS effects on spectral parameters we combined all LTP animals (LTP-SAL and LTP-KET groups) into one group (LTP group) since HFS was the only manipulation from the second electrical stimulation until drug injection.",

Briefly, comodulation maps were constructed applying Hilbert transform to the signal filtered in bins of 0.5 Hz from 1 to 20 Hz on steps of 1 Hz for the phase modulating signal, while the amplitude modulated signal was filtered in bins of 1 Hz from 10 to 120 Hz on steps of 5 Hz. Shannon entropy of the distribution of mean amplitudes per phase (divided into 18 bins) in each frequency bin was calculated to obtain the cross-frequency modulation index (MI) for each period. The MI between delta oscillations (1-2 Hz) and high gamma band (65-100 Hz) was calculated for comparisons.",

Cross-correlation measures the similarity of two time series by performing the sliding dot product between the signals. We calculated the peak lag of the cross-correlation of delta and theta filtered signals for deactivated and activated epochs, respectively. Wiener-Granger causality spectra were performed using the MVGC toolbox developed by Barnett and Seth 83 , which is freely available online (http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~lionelb/MVGC/ ). Such algorithm uses vector auto-regressive models to estimate prediction of a time series A based on another time series B comparing with the prediction obtained by using the past values of time series A alone. We used pairs of HPC and PFC LFP separating for DEA or ACT epochs. Initially, raw LFP were decimated to 200 Hz, and the model order was estimated by Akaike Information Criterion for each animal separately (model order range: [36] [37] [38] . We fixed the model order of 40, which gave an adequate frequency resolution for the slow oscillations that predominate on our signals with reasonable computation cost. For statistical significance, we calculated the 95 % confidence interval (CI) from the empirical null distribution of the frequency-domain Granger estimates, based on randomly permuting one LFP in bins the size of the model order. For directionality comparison (HPC\u2192PFC vs. PFC\u2192HPC; in DEA or ACT) we used a Bonferroni-corrected paired t test for the peak frequency in the delta (0.5 -2 Hz) or theta (3) (4) (5) bands.",
