            "text": "Hepatitis E is an acute human liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Hepatitis E is usually a mild self\u2010limiting disease; however, it may be fatal, especially among pregnant women in developing countries, or become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. Besides the infection of humans, HEV or HEV\u2010related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species (Smith et al., 2013). Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E\u2010related causes (WHO, 2013). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 20 million people get infected with HEV and three million develop acute hepatitis every year (WHO, 2013). The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries although the epidemiological profile varies between countries according to the level of development. In developed countries, hepatitis E is more associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver (swine, wild boar and deer) (Wichmann et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2010). In developing countries, hepatitis E is still linked to poor sanitary conditions ((CDC), C. f. D. C. a. P., 2013).",

The unknown viral agent was only identified in the eighties and named \u2018enterically transmitted non\u2010A and non\u2010B hepatitis\u2019 (ET\u2010NANBH; Francis and Maynard, 1979; Sreenivasan et al., 1984). Later in the nineties, the ET\u2010NANBH virus was inoculated into cynomolgus monkeys, HEV cDNA was isolated for the first time, and the name \u2018HEV\u2019 was proposed (Reyes et al., 1990). Since then the number of reports on HEV infections in the human population has increased considerably, showing that HEV was present in many different countries (Aye et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1992; Tsarev et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1994).",

The criteria proposed for this new classification were based on phylogeny and host range. Accordingly, Orthohepevirus A comprises sequences found in humans, pigs, wild boar, rabbit, deer, mongoose and camel; Orthohepevirus B contains viruses found in chickens; Orthohepevirus C encompasses sequences found in rats (HEV\u2010C1) and ferrets (HEV\u2010C2); and Orthohepevirus D, the bat virus (Table 1). Genotypes were also proposed for Orthohepevirus A: genotypes HEV\u20101 and HEV\u20102 have only been identified in humans, genotypes HEV\u20103 and HEV\u20104 have been reported in both humans and different animal species and are associated with the zoonotic cases. Genotypes HEV\u20105 and HEV\u20106 have been found in wild boar in Japan and genotype HEV\u20107 in dromedary camels in Dubai (Table 1; Smith et al., 2014; Pavio et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Classification under the genotype level is very useful and important for both clinical and epidemiological studies. The most frequently used classification was proposed by Lu et al. (2006) and encompasses 24 subtypes. Genotypes 1\u20134 are split into five (a\u2013e), two (a\u2013b), 10 (a\u2013j) and seven (a\u2013g) subtypes, respectively (Lu et al., 2006). This classification is controversial and is not accepted by all researchers in the field. For instance, there are a number of publications including partial and complete genomic sequences of HEV with no differentiation under the genotype level (Takahashi et al., 2003; Tei et al., 2003; Sonoda et al., 2004; Wibawa et al., 2004). The main concern is related to the reliability of the subtype separation and, consequently, the usefulness of subtyping (Oliveira\u2010Filho et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013). The ICTV study group has not defined a permanent system for classification under genotype level (subgenotype or subtypes); however, it has recommended the use of approaches based on labelling clades according to tree topology (Smith et al., 2014). Thus, genotype HEV\u20103 has been divided into three subgenotypes 3.1 (or G3 group 1), 3.2 (or G3 group 2) and 3.3 (Oliveira\u2010Filho et al., 2013; Ijaz et al., 2014), and genotype HEV\u20104 has been divided into seven subgenotypes 4 a\u2013g (Dai et al., 2013).",

Several other species such as tamarins, rhesus monkey, three\u2010striped night monkey and the common chimpanzee were also successfully infected with HEV (Bradley et al., 1987; Gupta et al., 1990; Ticehurst et al., 1992; McCaustland et al., 2000).

The same short HEV ORF2 sequence of 189 bp was amplified from six faecal samples of sheep by the same research group in China. These sequences showed homology of 99\u2013100% between themselves and 79\u201385%, 81\u201383%, 79\u201384% and 85\u201395% homology with genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and clustered into genotype 4 (Wang and Ma, 2010). However, additional studies must be conducted to confirm the presence of viruses in these animal species, and longer sequences need to be isolated to confirm the genotype assignment.

However, secondary reservoirs in pigs and wild boar contribute to the maintenance of the infection (HEV genotypes 3 and 4) in developed countries with a high sanitary level.

Viruses found in birds could not be transmitted experimentally to primates (Huang et al., 2004). The transmission of rat or avian HEV to humans cannot be completely ruled out, but these species are not currently considered to be reservoirs of human HEV. The possibility that bats may play a role as a reservoir of HEV in mammals, as reported for many viruses such as coronaviruses or paramyxoviruses, was examined. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that viruses found in bats belong to the Hepeviridae family and seem to be the most divergent mammalian hepeviruses described so far. Therefore, it is unlikely that bats transmit the virus to humans (Drexler et al., 2012). It is also unlikely that the transmission from trout to humans occurs due to the phylogenetic gaps found between HEV and CTV sequences.

If the ancestor of genotypes 1\u20134 is hypothesized to be a human virus transmitted from humans to suids, animals would be the recent onset reservoirs with a role of maintenance of infection and reinfection of other mammals including humans. For instance, the presence of HEV more specific to wild boar (Sato et al., 2011; Takahashi et al., 2011) may be indicative of the existence of a specific viral evolution, reflecting the maintenance of viral infection in this animal population. The difference between HEV sequences from wild boars and domestic pigs might be related to a dissimilarity in the structure of the two animal populations that could be explained by a higher turnover in domestic pig populations than in wild boar, despite a possible conservation of viruses in reproductive pig herds in sows and boars. This might lead to a lower capacity of the virus to evolve in the domestic swine population. Instead, environmental and behavioural differences of the wild boar may allow a greater stabilization of the virus in this population and promote selection and maintenance of new viruses. A similar evolution may have occurred with the rabbit strain, starting from a related genotype 3 ancestor, but with a separate evolution in the rabbit population. The higher HEV prevalence in domestic swine than in wild animals could be explained by the continuous exchange of viruses between the human and the swine populations. In addition, the intensive contact among confined populations or farmed swine may increase the potential for infection.",

This Bayesian analysis considered neither recombination events nor host species evolution. However, hosts of Orthohepevirus C variants have been detected from Carnivora, Rodentia and Soricomorpha, and Orthohepevirus A variants have been detected from Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Lagomorpha and Primates. Such diversification of host orders suggests that HEV did not co\u2010evolve with its hosts, but is more likely an opportunistic pathogen (Smith et al., 2014). The division that might have led to the ancestors of human and swine hepevirus occurred at about the same time. The appearance of the HEV\u2010C1 suggests that mammalian HEV could have been adapted to different mammalian species over time (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2010). There is evidence that genotype 1 or an anthropotropic ancestor of genotype 1 has been responsible for acute hepatitis infections among adults since the last decade of the 18th century (Teo, 2012). This indicates that either estimates for the time for the most recent common ancestor for genotype 1 are underestimated or genotype 1 has gone through an evolutionary bottleneck and the ancestor is a survivor of that bottleneck. The further discovery of other mammalian HEV\u2010related viruses may help to improve the understanding of Hepeviridae evolution. However, the lack of fossil viruses, preventing a confirmation of statistical analyses conducted so far (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2010), poses a challenge regarding the elucidation of the HEV (and HEV\u2010related viruses) origin.
