            "text": "It is now well recognized that bacterial cultivation techniques do not yield sufficient information about the microbial diversity in complex biologic ecosystems because of their significant limitations. Firstly, there is currently not enough information available about the optimal growth requirements of most microorganisms, which explains why only a minority of intestinal microbes can be recovered on culture mediums. Secondly, the GI tract harbors predominantly anaerobic bacteria, which may be more prone to damage during sample handling. Thirdly, many microbes live in mutualistic interactions with other microorganisms or the host, and this hinders their growth on culture media. Additionally, many selective culture media lack sufficient specificity and often other organisms than the targets are enumerated.10 Finally, phenotypic and biochemical identification systems frequently fail to accurately classify many microorganisms residing in the gut. Therefore, DNA sequencing of culture isolates is often required. Because of these limitations, it is estimated that only a small fraction (<5%) of intestinal bacteria can be cultivated, and a much smaller fraction can be correctly identified and classified.",

Different techniques include denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In DGGE and TGGE, differences in nucleotide composition result in unique melting behaviors of the individual PCR amplicons, generating a banding pattern that illustrates the bacterial diversity in the sample. DGGE and TGGE are inexpensive and can be rapidly performed. However, DGGE and TGGE only allow a limited resolution of PCR amplicons because many bacterial phylotypes may have similar melting behaviors. Therefore, these techniques capture only changes in the predominant bacterial groups within the gut community. For identification purposes, bands of interest need to be sequenced. In T-RFLP, amplicons labeled with a fluorescent primer are fragmented in different sizes using sequence specific restriction enzymes, again yielding a characteristic fingerprint of the microbial community.7\n",

The use of different DNA extraction methods (eg, bead beating steps, heating in lysis buffer)1, 13 and the use of different PCR primers will yield slightly different results between studies.12, 21 For example, some commonly used PCR primers underestimate the presence of specific bacterial groups, especially those with a high guanine-cytosine content (eg, Bifidobacterium spp),11, 21 and some investigators use either a primer mix or group-specific primers for more accurate amplification.22 Because of the high bacterial diversity in the intestine, groups of low abundance constitute such a low proportion of total bacteria that they escape identification even when high-throughput sequencing techniques using broad-range primers are employed. The additional use of group-specific PCR assays is needed to detect these groups of interest. Furthermore, PCR can exhibit bias in quantification of specific bacterial groups. For example, the bacterial 16S rRNA gene is organized in so-called operons. These operons can vary in number from 1 to 15 within individual bacterial phylotypes. The operon number may also change during the growth phase and changed activity of cells.23 Therefore, the proportions of bacterial groups with higher operon numbers may be overestimated in 16S rRNA gene libraries or by qPCR, and caution should be used to directly relate molecular results to absolute cell counts. Because of the high diversity of the microbial community, no optimal DNA extraction protocol or PCR-based identification method exists for accurate characterization of all microorganisms, and the various methods available should be used complementarily.",

            "text": "The amplification of a specific gene (eg, 16S rRNA gene) allows identification of intestinal bacteria and has yielded comprehensive information about which bacterial groups are present in the canine and feline GI tract. However, because only one single gene is evaluated in comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis, these methods yield only phylogenetic information (answering the question: who is there?). They do not provide information about the functional properties of the intestinal microbiome. The microbiota differs substantially at the species and strain level in each individual animal.2, 15, 17 Despite these phylogenetic differences, the metabolic end products of the gastrointestinal microbiome are similar between individuals. Also, although some environmental influences (eg, diet, fasting) may lead to changes in bacterial groups, these changes are not immediately associated with any major alterations in gut physiology in healthy animals. For example, antibiotic administration has a profound impact on the composition of gut microbiota but these microbial changes do not correlate with gut function.1, 24 Therefore, for a better understanding of microbial-host interactions in health and disease, the functionality of the intestinal microbiome needs to be explored. New high-throughput sequencing platforms facilitate rapid sequencing of total genomic DNA or mRNA without prior amplification of specific genes. Therefore, in addition to phylogenetic identification of microorganisms, these techniques yield information about the gene content (metagenomics) or the expressed genes (transcriptomics) within the microbiome, and may therefore define the functional potential of the microbiome.14, 25 Metagenomic approaches have revealed the existence of a core microbiome in the mammalian intestine. Despite differences in abundance and prevalence of specific bacterial phylotypes, individuals possess similar microbial genes and metabolic pathways,14, 25 which indicates a functional redundancy of the gastrointestinal microbiota.24 The various members of the microbial community perform similar functions, and if one group is depressed because of external factors (eg, antibiotic therapy), other members of the community are capable of maintaining the functionality within the ecosystem. These findings emphasize the need for evaluating both phylogenetic relationships and metabolic functions (ie, metagenomics and transcriptomics) of the intestinal microbiome.",

Duodenal bacterial counts are low in most dogs (<103 cfu/g or ml of duodenal aspirates), but they may reach up 109 cfu/g or ml in some dogs.29, 30 The feline duodenum reportedly harbors higher bacterial counts (105\u2013108 cfu/g or ml), and anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Eubacterium spp) appear to predominate unlike in dogs.29 The bacterial counts found in the proximal small intestine of some healthy dogs and cats are substantially higher than typically found in humans, where bacterial counts greater than 105 cfu/g or ml of small bowel aspirates indicate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Although initial studies in dogs defined SIBO based on the same numerical criteria as in humans (bacterial counts >105 cfu/g or ml for aerobes or >104 cfu/g or ml for anaerobes),31 subsequent investigations showed that healthy dogs can have bacterial counts that by far exceed those proposed cutoffs.30 Therefore, the use of the term SIBO is now controversial in dogs, and authors prefer the terms antibiotic-responsive diarrhea or small intestinal dysbiosis. SIBO has not been reported in the cat based on the higher physiologic bacterial counts found in that species.28\n",

For example, percentages of Firmicutes range between 25% and 95% of obtained 16S rRNA gene sequencing tags.2, 13 These wide ranges are most likely caused by differences in DNA extraction methods and selection of different universal PCR primers. In contrast to results from 16S rRNA gene-based studies, Actinobacteria were documented to be abundant in feline feces in a comparative chaperonin 60 gene analysis.12 This finding is not surprising because it has been shown that 16S rRNA gene approaches routinely underestimate the abundance of Actinobacteria in intestinal samples when universal bacterial primers are used.21 In contrast, the use of group-specific primers for Bifidobacterium spp, members of the phylum Actinobacteria, or the use of FISH analysis with Bifidobacterium species-specific probes confirm that this bacterial group is present in the intestinal tract of the majority of dogs and cats.8, 9, 21 In a recent metagenomic study, the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes represented each approximately 35% of sequences obtained from canine feces, followed by Proteobacteria (15%) and Fusobacteria (8%).

They are part of the normal intestinal flora in ruminants and have also been characterized in human intestinal samples, with Methanobacteria being the predominant form.42 The role of archaea in gastrointestinal health is unclear. Hydrogen is an end product generated by other intestinal microbes as a result of microbial fermentation and is metabolized by methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which produce methane and hydrogen sulfite, respectively. Hydrogen consumption by methanogens and SRB is an important scavenging pathway. An abnormal accumulation of hydrogen would inhibit further microbial fermentation, resulting in a decreased production of short-chain fatty acids. An imbalance of SRB to methanogens may result in increased production of hydrogen sulfite, which has the potential to damage epithelial cells.43 Initial studies have revealed a higher abundance of sulfite-producing bacteria in the colon of cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).8\n",
