SARS-CoV-2 was detected in saliva in 8 of 9 (89%) patients and in all 11 samples taken within 2 weeks after disease onset. Viral load was equivalent at earlier time points but declined in saliva than nasopharyngeal samples. PCR negativity was also concordant in all 27 saliva samples from 24 patients between nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. These results suggest that saliva is a reliable noninvasive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and facilitate widespread PCR testing in the face of shortages of swabs and protective equipment without posing a risk to healthcare workers.",

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by PCR testing of samples collected by nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, with the nasopharyngeal route being the standard with a sensitivity for the virus in the range of 52-71% [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, swab sample collection requires specialized medical personnel with protective equipment and poses a risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers. Although sputum specimen is a noninvasive alternative, sputum production is seen in only 28% of COVID-19 patients 6 .",

ACE2 is highly expressed on the mucous of oral cavity, particularly in epithelial cells of the tongue 9 . These findings explain mechanisms that the oral cavity is high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission occurs through saliva before the onset of symptoms, and the impairment of the sense of taste 10 . Thus, it is reasonable to use saliva as a diagnostic sample, and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is detected in saliva [11] [12] [13] . Moreover, Wyllie et al. demonstrated the saliva to be more sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 detection patients than nasopharyngeal swabs 14 . However, few studies compared viral load between nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. We herein compared the diagnostic value of saliva and nasopharyngeal samples using prospectively collected paired samples.",

Our results showed that the viral load was equivalent at earlier time points but lower in saliva than in nasopharyngeal samples at later points. Although it is difficult to compare viral concentration in saliva itself and in transport media of the swab samples, there are several possibilities to explain the inconsistency. First, salivary viral load appears to be highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declines with time 11, 13, 14 . Our study did not include samples taken during the first week after onset. Second, differences in sampling methods may have contributed to the discrepant results. Specifically, the 1ml volume of our saliva samples in our study were much smaller in our study with compared to a third full cup of saliva collected in the Yale study. There was inconsistency of nasopharyngeal swab samples in the Yale study 14 , while our data showed less inconsistency, probably due to swab sampling performed exclusively by only three pulmonologists. Last, all patients in our study were treated with favipiravir 15 , which may be associated with rapid virus clearance from the oral cavity.",

Total RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) from each specimen. One-step RT-qPCR was performed by One-Step Real-Time RT-PCR Master Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), from extracted RNA. The instrument used was the StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Forward primer (5-AAATTTTGGGGACCAGGAAC-3), reverse primer (5-TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGTCAAC-3) and TaqMan probe (5'-FAM-ATGTCGCGCATTGGCATGGA-BHQ-3') were used.",

It seems that the saliva samples become PCR negative earlier than nasopharyngeal samples. On the other hand, PCR negativity was concordant with nasopharyngeal and saliva samples; the virus was not detected in both saliva and nasopharyngeal specimen in all 27 samples taken from 24 COVID-19 suspicious patients.",
