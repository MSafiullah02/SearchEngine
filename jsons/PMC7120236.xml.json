            "text": "Proper sample collection, storage, transportation and enrichment are crucial for the reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases. To avoid potential degradation of the targeted nucleic acids, the samples are normally transported at low temperature using dry ice, cooling batteries and/or are stored in \u221220/70 \u00b0C freezers before further processing. Heat- and/or chemical inactivation of samples is required to avoid the transmission and spread of infectious agents. In order to diagnose the various known and \u201cunknown\u201d diseases in a safe and reliable way, proper methodologies are needed, which simplify the handling, processing of the samples, and the transport to the diagnostic laboratories. Currently, several simple tools, such as different filter papers or cards are commercially available for such purposes. For example, FTA\u2122 Cards, produced by Whatman plc, now a part of GE Healthcare, are suitable for the collection, transportation and storage of samples at room temperature. The company claimed that such FTA Cards contain chemicals that lyse cells, denature proteins and protect nucleic acids from nucleases, as well as from the damages caused by heat, oxidative and UV effects. At the Collaborating Centre, our colleagues have used these types of cards for transportation of samples from other countries and continents to Sweden. For example, ASF serum samples were collected in Uganda, placed on the filter papers, and transported to Sweden at room temperature. The same type of filter papers was used for transportation of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) samples from Pakistan. Bat coronavirus samples were sent from Brazil to Sweden in an envelope, by post. Viral nucleic acids, eluted from the cards, are successfully amplified by various PCR assays or detected by other means of molecular diagnostic virology. We perform real-time PCR assays, using small pieces of cards containing samples as templates and various viruses are detected in a convincing way after this simple way of sample transportation.",

The low target content may lead to false negative results in the various PCR assays and in other molecular diagnostic procedures. In order to avoid or to reduce this very important bottleneck effect, diagnostic laboratories develop and apply a range of sample enrichment methods, in order to \u201cfish out\u201d the targeted pathogens or their components, such as nucleic acids or proteins, from the analyzed specimens. For example, DNA enrichment is achieved by functionalized magnetic nanoparticles that are coupled with probes to which the target DNA could be hybridized [3].",

It is almost impossible to complete such a task by manual extraction methods such as TRIzol reagent or spin columns. The manual extraction processes are labour- and time-consuming and expensive. In addition, personnel costs and working processes have to be considered. For those reasons, various kinds of automated equipment have been developed and commercialized for nucleic acid preparation and/or handling of samples. At our OIE Collaborating Centre the automated nucleic acid extraction steps are performed with robotic extraction machines.",

It is the causative agent of classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contagious disease affecting both wild boars and domestic pigs. In Europe, the virus is largely maintained in the wild boar populations that serve as a reservoir for reintroduction to domestic pigs. Recently, a chimeric \u00advaccine candidate, CP7_E2alf has been developed and has the potential to be used as a safe and efficient marker vaccine in wild boars, which enables differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals [11, 12]. A vaccine-specific TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was developed and evaluated, and a second, wild type-specific assay was modified from an established one in such a way that both can be performed in two wells side-by-side in a microplate in a single run [13]. Both assays could be applied in CSFV vaccination and control programs in the wild boar population.",

            "text": "CSF remains endemic in domestic pigs in some countries, for example, China, where vaccination with the traditional lapinized live virus is still in practice. DIVA diagnostics is a potentially powerful tool to discriminate whether pigs are naturally infected with wild type strains or vaccinated with the lapinized live virus. The Chinese Hog Cholera Lapinized virus (HCLV) has been through extensive serial passages in rabbits in China in 1950s and is completely attenuated, but retains its efficacy as vaccine. Due to its safety and efficacy, this vaccine was introduced into European countries and named as \u201cChinese\u201d strain (C-strain). \u201cRiems\u201d C-strain is one of the commercial vaccines derived from the Chinese strain. Development of a vaccine-specific real-time RT-PCR would be of great value, which could be used in parallel with a wild type-specific or generic real-time RT-PCR for detection and \u00addifferentiation of wild type viruses from vaccine strains. Leifer et al. studied differentiation of Riems C-strain-vaccinated pigs from animals infected by CSFV field strains using real-time TaqMan RT-PCR [14]. Leifer et al. also reported escape of CSF C-strain vaccine virus from detection by C-strain specific real-time RT-PCR caused by a point mutation in the primer-binding site [15]. At the Collaborating Centre, we have developed a real-time PCR based on primer-probe energy transfer technology (PriProET) for the improved detection of CSFV [16]. The PriProET technology was developed initially as a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of all serotypes of FMDV [17], and subsequently was used for detection of other pathogens, including SVDV [18], and bluetongue virus (BTV) [19]. Following PCR amplification, the melting curve analysis allows confirmation of specific amplicons, and differentiation between wild type CSFV and the HCLV vaccine strain (Fig. 36.1). Further evaluation of the assay demonstrated that in an RNA mixture of both wild type CSFV and C-strain vaccine, the melting curves displayed only one curve either a wild type-like or a vaccine-like depending on the dominating RNA [20]. Therefore, the PriProET melting curve analysis could identify the presence of CSFV field strain in equivocal samples or in animals vaccinated with C-strain, but would not reliably detect infections with wild-type virus in a population vaccinated with the Riems strain. In a recent study, a generic real-time TaqMan RT-PCR was developed for the specific detection of three lapinized vaccine strains, namely, the Taiwanese Lapinized Philippines Coronel (LPC), the Chinese HCLV, and the European Riems C-strain [21]. The new assay was able to detect the Riemser C-strain vaccine viral RNA in experimental samples, indicating that the assay could be a useful tool to facilitate outbreak control if a strategy using these lapinized vaccines is deployed.\n",

Due to nucleotide sequence variations, the identification of these viruses might fail, since primers and probes had mismatches to their target, leading to a false negative result. For example, the well-known \u201cpan-pestivirus\u201d primer pair 324/326 failed to react with D32/00_\u2018HoBi\u2019 virus that was found in a batch of contaminated foetal calf serum [22]. To overcome the limitations of current molecular methods, a new one-step real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay was developed for the specific detection of atypical bovine pestiviruses in clinical samples and in biological products [23]. This new assay provides a useful tool for highly sensitive and specific detection of atypical bovine pestiviruses and can be applied in combination with other diagnostic methods to ensure that biological products, including FBS and vaccines, are free from pestivirus contamination. Recently, we have tested 33 batches of commercial FBS by this approach and found all batches were positive for at least one species of bovine pestiviruses. The consequence of using contaminated FBS in diagnostic laboratories is detrimental. Isolation of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in bovine turbinate cells is a routine method, which requires FBS during preparation of the cell cultures. A batch of contaminated FBS of South American origin had disturbed virus isolation. Tests showed presence of both the recognized species and the newly described atypical bovine pestivirus in the FBS batch. The contaminating atypical pestivirus was further characterized, as it is described by our group [24].",

In this PCR panel the degenerated primers are targeting a conserved region of the ORF1b of the viral and have a low annealing temperature.

In order to avoid false diagnosis, melting curve analysis is needed in this assay. The melting curve analysis is a practical tool to verify the truly positive results. In summary, it was concluded that this SYBR Green-based real-time pan-coronavirus PCR assay, along with melting curve analysis, provides a powerful novel tool for the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus infections and for detecting the emerging, yet to be uncharacterized new coronavirus variants.

To overcome this limitation, three overlapping TaqMan probes were designed and used together with the above-mentioned primers for sensitive and specific detection of coronaviruses of all three groups [27]. We have found this three-probe approach reduced the degree of probe degeneration and maintained a high sensitivity and specificity. The assay detected coronaviruses in human nasopharyngeal aspirate samples and in duck faecal samples. Furthermore, this method was able to detect SARS-CoV in a reference material, and detect the synthetic sequences of bat coronaviruses (HKU3-CoV, HKU5-Cov and HKU9-CoV), indicating it is a useful tool for screening samples of animal origin for zoonotic or potentially zoonotic pathogens.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important food- and waterborne zoonotic pathogen, which is an emerging virus of global importance. This single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belongs to the genus Hepevirus in the family of Hepeviridae that includes at least four recognized genotypes. While genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in humans in developing countries with poor sanitary conditions, genotypes 3 and 4 HEV strains are able to infect both humans and various animal species, in particular, domestic pigs and wild boars, and are responsible for sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E not only in the developing, but also in the industrialized countries. It has been recognized that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease. At our OIE Collaborating Centre, Gyarmati et al. developed two real-time PCR assays for universal detection of all four genotypes of HEV [29]. Both the TaqMan and PriProET assays were able to detect 20 viral genome equivalents per reaction. The results obtained from both real-time PCR assays were comparable to those from a nested gel-based PCR. However, the TaqMan assay had higher reaction efficiency and performed slightly better than the PriProET assay. Such tools are important not only for veterinary diagnostics but also for molecular epidemiology of HEV in humans, pigs and wild boars [30].",

This technique is referred to proximity ligation assay (PLA) [31]. In a proximity ligation assay, two oligonucleotides are coupled to antibodies. Binding of the antibodies to the same target will bring the two oligonucleotides sufficiently close to each other (or in proximity) such that the two ends could be ligated with the help of a third connector oligonucleotide. The ligation products are then used as target DNA for subsequent amplification and detection by real-time PCR. At the OIE Collaborating Centre in Uppsala, Schlingemann et al. used this technique to detect antigens of avian influenza viruses in biological samples [32]. We have found that the method is four orders of magnitude more sensitive than a sandwich ELISA, which utilized the same antibody. This study opens a new window for diagnostic virology, by using PLA for the highly effective detection of viral proteins in clinical specimens.",

At our OIE Collaborating Centre a range of Luminex assays have been developed for the multiplex detection of pathogens important in human and veterinary medicine. A suspension microarray assay was constructed for detection and differentiation of pestiviruses including CSFV, BVDV-1, BVDV-2, border disease virus (BDV) and the atypical bovine pestivirus [33]. Following PCR amplification of target genetic region, one strand of the amplicons was removed by Lambda exonuclease to generate single-stranded PCR products for efficient hybridization to the microsphere-coupled oligo probes. After incubation with a reporter dye streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin, the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of each reaction was measured in a Luminex instrument. The system was able to provide positive/negative results and to identify each species by comparing MFI values. Such an assay is a useful tool for the genetic detection of various pestiviruses in cattle.",

After addition of another MAb that is biotinylated, R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin was added and the MFI values were measured on a Luminex 200 analyzer. This blocking microsphere-based immunoassay had intra- and inter-assay variability of 4.9 % and <7 %, respectively, and variability of bead conjugations of <6.6 %. By testing a total of 509 serum samples, the assay had a sensitivity of 99.4 % and a specificity of 98.3 % relative to a commercial blocking ELISA. The new microsphere immunoassay provides an alternative to conventional ELISA systems and can be used for high-throughput screening in the BVD control and eradication program. As BVDV is one of the pathogens causing bovine respiratory disease (BRD) \u00adcomplex, our ongoing work at the Collaborating Centre is to develop a multiplex Luminex assay for the high-throughput, simultaneous detection of antibodies against four major viruses that cause BRD, namely, BVDV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza type-3 virus (PIV3) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV).

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to play an important role in the complex infection biology of PMWS. PCV-2 is a small circular DNA virus belonging to the family Circoviridae. The virus is ubiquitously distributed in almost all pig populations, not only in PMWS pigs but also in clinically healthy ones. Therefore, it is hypothesized that other known or unknown factors may have a contribution to the development of PMWS. Aiming to find possible factors contributed to PMWS in piglets, our group tested lymph node samples that were collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS, by using GS-FLX 454 technology for large-scale sequencing of randomly amplified products [35]. Analysis of about 9,000 unique sequences obtained from the 454 run showed presence of PCV-2, Torque Teno virus genotypes 1 and 2 (TTV-1 and TTV-2), as well as a novel \u00adparvovirus-like agent, termed as porcine boca-like virus in the lymph nodes from the diseased pigs. Based on this study, Blomstr\u00f6m et al. screened 34 PMWS pigs and 24 animals without PMWS by PCR for the presence of PCV-2, TTV-1, TTV-2 and porcine boca-like virus [36]. PCV-2 was found in all PMWS pigs and in 80 % of pigs without PMWS. Presence of all three viruses TTV-1, TTV-2 and porcine boca-like virus was found in 71 % of the PMWS pigs and in 33 % pigs without PMWS. The exact role of these viruses, particularly the porcine boca-like virus in the development of PMWS requires further investigations.",

General virological investigations, including virus culture, negative-staining electron microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, broad targeting PCR for herpesviruses, adenoviruses, pestiviruses and coronaviruses, and specific tests for six viral diseases, for three protozoa, for bacteria and intracerebral inoculation of neonatal mice were conducted but with negative results. It was postulated that it is likely that the disease was caused by a yet unidentified virus [37]. To investigate the cause, brain samples from experimental infection were prepared for nucleic acid extraction and random amplification and large-scale sequencing using GS-FLX 454 technology [38]. Analysis of the 454 sequencing data revealed eight sequence fragments similar to mink astrovirus. Based on the result, new primers were designed in order to determine the nucleotide sequences of the complete viral genome. The comparative analysis of complete genome sequences showed a similarity of 80.4 % to that of a mink astrovirus causing pre-weaning diarrhoea in mink. As the virus was not detected in healthy mink kits, we suppose an association between the astrovirus and the neurological disease of mink.",

The answer to this question has implication in veterinary diagnostic virology as well as in the BVD control and eradication program in various countries.

Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences by Neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and the Bayesian approach, unanimously placed Th/04_KhonKaen in a single lineage, distinct from the established pestivirus species, and close to BVDV-1 and BVDV-2.

As the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Collaborating Centre for the Biotechnology-Based Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases in Veterinary Medicine, we have developed and tested a wide range of novel molecular diagnostic methods. Many of these novel assays provided powerful novel tools for the improved detection of viruses in veterinary and human medical virology. A wide range of the novel molecular diagnostic methods has been internationally compared in ring tests and validated. In order to illustrate this trend of development, several examples are summarized in this chapter. For molecular methods, upstream nucleic acid extraction is crucial for the success of the downstream diagnostic tests. We came to the conclusion that the real-time PCR principle, using different chemistries, such as TaqMan and PriProET, provides very reliable, highly sensitive and specific novel diagnostic tools for the direct detection of a wide range of pathogens, as it is demonstrated here with several examples. Simultaneously, the real-time PCR technology allows the development of novel DIVA tests, which are highly required for the improved control of infectious diseases, using marker vaccines and accompanied diagnostic packages. In parallel, high-throughput suspension microarray technologies enable the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple pathogens in single test platforms. The liquid-phase microarray platforms, such as Luminex panels, are accelerating the detection of emerging animal viruses and zoonotic, in particular, the water- and foodborne pathogens. Proximity ligation assay has emerged as a novel method for the highly sensitive and specific detection of the viral proteins. Viral metagenomics and large-scale genome sequencing establish powerful tools for the detection of \u201cunknown\u201d viruses, as well for the identification of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. These novel approaches strongly support the investigation of disease complexes and/or emerging novel disease scenarios in veterinary diagnostic virology, with regard to diseases in domestic animals and in wildlife, with special regard to zoonotic infections, by following the principles of \u201cOne World One Health.\u201d",
