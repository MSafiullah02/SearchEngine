Clinical deterioration results from right sided heart failure, obstructive shock, hypoxia, and death in the most severe cases (1) . With a diverse range of clinical presentations, diagnosis and timely risk stratification is important. Low risk PE is defined by normotension, normal right ventricular function on CT or TTE, and no evidence of ischemia with biomarkers (troponin/BNP). Submassive PE manifests with RV dysfunction on imaging and/or abnormal biomarkers with normotension. Massive PE is characterized by hemodynamic collapse defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90mmHg or a >40mmHg decrease in SBP for more than 15 minutes, or requiring inotropic support with associated RV dysfunction and ischemia (2) .",

The appropriate therapeutic strategy must weigh the patient's risk of decompensation, potential benefit of intervention, risk of provider exposure and infection, and availability of hospital resources during this pandemic. At our institution, the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team rapidly evaluates COVID-19 PUI or confirmed patients and assesses their risk of decompensation based on several clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic markers (Figure 3) (8,10). Half dose systemic thrombolysis is given to patients at high risk for decompensation. Conversely, stable patients are medically managed with close observation. If new high-risk features develop, either a half dose systemic thrombolytic or CDT strategy is employed based on results from the COVID-19 assay.",
