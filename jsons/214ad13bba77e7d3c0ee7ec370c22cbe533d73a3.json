Yellow category agents have low to absent risk of blood transmission, but there is public and regulatory concern. These agents include chronic wasting disease [CWD] prion agent, never detected in humans or donated blood; human herpesvirus-8 , transmitted by transfusion in Africa [5] and possible in the USA but not proven [6] , and resulted in no clinical disease; HIV variants are potentially blood transmissible but never proven; human parvovirus B19 which has been proven to be transmitted by blood [four documented cases by 2009], but very low risk except for hemophilia and conditions requiring recurrent chronic transfusion and immunosuppression; avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 unlikely to be blood transmitted, but high profile for possible pandemic spread; simian foamy virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion in nonhuman primates, but never demonstrated in humans and is theoretically possible; Borrelia burgdorferi [Lyme disease agent] potentially possible but no proven cases of transfusion transmitted; and hepatitis A virus [HAV] is very rarely transmitted by transfusion in neonatal intensive care units.
