Twenty peer reviewed papers from different countries have been analyzed, highlighting the rationale behind each study and the efficacy of the investigated treatment in terms of macro-and micro-pollutants. Hospital wastewaters are subjected to different treatment scenarios in the studied countries (specific treatment, co-treatment, and direct disposal into the environment). Different technologies have been adopted acting as primary, secondary, and tertiary steps, the most widely applied technology being conventional activated sludge (CAS), followed by membrane bioreactor (MBR). Other types of technology were also investigated. Referring to the removal efficiency of macro-and micro-pollutants, the collected data demonstrates good removal efficiency of macro-pollutants using the current adopted technologies, while the removal of micro-pollutants (pharmaceutical substances) varies from low to high removal and release of some compounds was also observed. In general, there is no single practice which could be considered a solution to the problem of managing HWWs -in many cases a number of sequences are used in combination.",

Higher concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) were found in hospital effluents than those found in municipal effluents [10, 11] . According to recent literature [8, [12] [13] [14] , HWWs may be considered a hot spot in terms of the PhC load generated, prompting the scientific community to question the acceptability of the general practice of discharging HWWs into public sewers [8] , where they are conveyed to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and co-treated with urban wastewaters (UWWs) [8, 13, 15, 16] .",

Hospital effluents are usually discharged into the urban sewer system, where they mix with other effluents before finally being treated in the sewage treatment plant (co-treatment). This practice is common in Australia, Iran, Egypt, India, Japan, South Africa, and Thailand. However, in many other developing countries, such as Algeria, Bangladesh, Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, hospital effluents can represent a major source of toxic elements in the aquatic environment since the effluents are discharged into drainage systems, rivers, and lakes without prior treatment. According to Ashfaq et al. [41] , no hospital, irrespective of its size, has installed proper wastewater treatment facilities in Pakistan. In Taiwan, some hospitals discharge their wastewaters Direct disposal into the environment [6] (legally or illegally) directly into nearby rivers with scarce treatment at all [44] . Of 70 governmental hospitals from different provinces of Iran, 48% were equipped with wastewater treatment systems, while 52% were not. Fifty-two percent of the hospitals without treatment plants disposed their raw wastewater into wells, 38% disposed it directly into the environment and the rest into the municipal wastewater network [35] . Comparison of the indicators between effluents of wastewater treatment systems and the standards of Environmental Departments shows the inefficiency of these systems and, despite recent improvements in hospital wastewater treatment systems, they should be upgraded. In Indonesia, only 36% of hospitals have a WWTP and 64% of wastewater is discharged directly into receiving water bodies or using infiltration wells. Mostly, Hospital Wastewater Treatment Plants (HWWTP) use a combination of biologicalchlorination processes with the discharge often exceeding the quality standard, such as Pb, phenol, ammonia free, ortho-phosphate, and free chlorine. The low quality of discharges into HWWTPs, especially of toxic pollutants (Pb and phenol), can be caused by not yet optimal biological-chlorination process [34] .",

However, the rationale behind the studies presented in this chapter was to evaluate different options for hospital effluent treatments before discharge into public sewage or into the environment, to improve the biodegradability of hospital effluents, to avoid the spread of pathogenic microorganisms, viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, pharmaceuticals, and chemical pollutants, to reduce the organic load and finally, to meet the requirements of discharge standards in different countries.

In the last few years a more complex investigation of antibiotics has been undertaken in different countries in order to assess their environmental risks. It has been found that the concentrations of antibiotics are higher in hospital effluents than in municipal wastewater, which has higher concentration levels than different surface waters, ground water, and sea water [53] . HWWs could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria which are excreted by patients. The HWWs either flow into a hospital sewage system or directly into a municipal wastewater sewer, before being subsequently treated in a WWTP. After treatment in a WWTP, the effluent is discharged into surface waters or is used for irrigation. Studies have shown that the release of wastewater from hospitals was associated with an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. A study conducted in Australia by Thompson et al. 2012 [27] revealed evidence of the survival of antibiotic resistant strains in untreated HWWs and their transit to the STP and then through to the final treated effluent. The strong influence of HWWs on the prevalence of antimicrobialresistant E. coli in Indian WWTPs has been revealed by Alam et al. [24] and Akiba et al. [33] . Untreated hospital and municipal wastewaters were found to be responsible for the dissemination of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the rivers of Pakistan [22] . In Bangladesh, a study was conducted by Akter et al. [23] concerning the effects of hospital effluents on the emergence and development of drug-resistant bacteria. They concluded that hospital and agricultural wastewater is mostly responsible for causing environmental pollution by spreading un-metabolized antibiotics and resistant bacteria. Analyses of the results obtained from South Africa indicated that HWWs may be one of the sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the receiving WWTP. The findings also revealed that the final effluent discharged into the environment was contaminated with multi-resistant enterococci species, thus posing a health hazard to the receiving aquatic environment as these could eventually be transmitted to the humans and animals exposed to it [43, 54] .",

Due to the lack of municipal wastewater treatment plants, the onsite treatment of hospital wastewater before discharge into municipal sewers should be considered a viable option and consequently implemented.
