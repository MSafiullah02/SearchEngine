Our findings also highlight the importance of planning for mass critical care as the need for ICU care and ventilatory support to treat patients with Covid-19 grows rapidly in the United States. 22, 23 Supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (K23DK116967, to Dr. Bhatraju).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 605, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 606, "end": 608, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We thank Adrienne Meyer from the University of Washington institutional review board for rapidly reviewing and facilitating study protocols across many area hospitals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "World Health Organization.
