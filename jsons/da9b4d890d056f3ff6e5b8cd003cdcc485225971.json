His APACHE II score was 37, with an estimated risk of death of 88 %. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. A thick blood smear revealed P. falciparum malaria. The patient was initiated with anti-malaria IV drugs: quinidine gluconate plus doxycycline. Despite antimalarial drug administration and supportive care the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, and an Important Thrombocytopenia (Fig. 57.2) .",

In addition, mixed infections with P. malariae or P. ovale are often missed, because their densities are often low in comparison to that of P falciparum. These problems may occur more frequently in non-endemic areas where malaria microscopy is performed infrequently.",

The sensitivity of QBC almost equals that of Giemsa-stained films. The advantage of QBC is ease of interpretation and rapidity. Species identification and quantification are difficult, however, with this technique and, therefore, thick and thin blood film examination is still required. This technique requires the use of expensive fluorescent microscopy equipment for the interpretation of results. This is an important limitation especially in the poor resource countries [19] .",

July 2013 a If a person develops malaria despite taking chemoprophylaxis, that particular medicine should not be used as a part of their treatment regimen. Use one of the other options instead b NOTE: There are 4 options (A, B, C, or D) available for treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Options A, B, and C are equally recommended. Because of a higher rate of severe neuropsychiatric reactions seen at treatment doses, we do not recommend option D (mefloquine) unless the other options cannot be used. For option C, because there is more data on the efficacy of quinine in combination with doxycycline or tetracycline, these treatment combinations are generally preferred to quinine in combination with clindamycin c Take with with food or whole milk. If patient vomits within 30 min of taking a dose, then they should repeat the dose d US manufactured quinine sulfate capsule is in a 324 mg dosage; therefore 2 capsules should be sufficient for adult dosing. Pediatric dosing may be difficult due to unavailability of non-capsule forms of quinine e For infections acquired in Southeast Asia, quinine treatment should continue for 7 days. For infections acquired elsewhere, quinine treatment should continue for 3 days f Doxycycline and tetracycline are not indicated for use in children less than 8 years old. For children less than 8 years old with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum, atovaquoneproguanil and artemether-lumefantrine are recommended treatment options; mefloquine can be considered if no other options are available. For children less than 8 years old with chloroquine-resistant P. vivax, mefloquine is the recommended treatment. If it is not available or is not being tolerated and if the treatment benefits outweigh the risks, atovaquone-proguanil or artemether-lumefantrine should be used instead g Treatment with mefloquine is not recommended in persons who have acquired infections from Southeast Asia due to drug resistance h When treating chloroquine-sensitive infections, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are recommended options. However, regimens used to treat chloroquine-resistant infections may also be used if available, more convenient, or preferred i Primaquine is used to eradicate any hypnozoites that may remain dormant in the liver, and thus prevent relapses, in P. vivax and P. ovale infections. Because primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient persons, G6PD screening must occur prior to starting treatment with primaquine. For persons with borderline G6PD deficiency or as an alternate to the above regimen, primaquine may be given 45 mg orally one time per week for 8 weeks; consultation with an expert in infectious disease and/or tropical medicine is advised if this alternative regimen is considered in G6PD-deficient persons. Primaquine must not be used during pregnancy j NOTE: There are three options (A, B, or C) available for treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. vivax. High treatment failure rates due to chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have been well documented in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Rare case reports of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have also been documented in Burma (Myanmar), India, and Central and South America. Persons acquiring P. vivax infections outside of Papua New Guinea or Indonesia should be started on chloroquine. If the patient does not respond, the treatment should be changed to a chloroquine-resistant P. vivax regimen and CDC should be notified (Malaria Hotline number listed above). For treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax infections, options A, B, and C are equally recommended k For pregnant women diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum or chloroquine-resistant P. vivax infection, treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is generally not indicated. However, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used in combination with quinine (as recommended for non-pregnant adults) if other treatment options are not available or are not being tolerated, and the benefit is judged to outweigh the risks l Atovaquone-proguanil and artemether-lumefantrine are generally not recommended for use in pregnant women, particularly in the first trimester due to lack of sufficient safety data. For pregnant women diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum infection, atovaquone-proguanil or artemether-lumefantrine may be used if other treatment options are not available or are not being tolerated, and if the potential benefit is judged to outweigh the potential risks m For P. vivax and P. ovale infections, primaquine phosphate for radical treatment of hypnozoites should not be given during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with P. vivax and P. ovale infections should be maintained on chloroquine prophylaxis for the duration of their pregnancy. The chemoprophylactic dose of chloroquine phosphate is 300 mg base (=500 mg salt) orally once per week. After delivery, pregnant patients who do not have G6PD deficiency should be treated with primaquine n Persons with a positive blood smear OR history of recent possible exposure and no other recognized pathology who have one or more of the following clinical criteria (impaired consciousness/coma, severe normocytic anemia, renal failure, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, circulatory shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, spontaneous bleeding, acidosis, hemoglobinuria, jaundice, repeated generalized convulsions, and/or parasitemia of >5 %) are considered to have manifestations of more severe disease. Severe malaria is most often caused by P. falciparum o Patients diagnosed with severe malaria should be treated aggressively with parenteral antimalarial therapy. Treatment with IV quinidine should be initiated as soon as possible",
