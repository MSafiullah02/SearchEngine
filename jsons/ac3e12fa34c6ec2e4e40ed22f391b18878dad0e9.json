In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82).",

People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.",

            "text": "On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organisation characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic after 118,000 cases and 4,291 deaths were reported in 114 countries. 1 As of 30 April, cases are over 3 million globally, with more than 200,000 deaths attributed to the virus. 2 In the UK, cases have reached 171,253, with 22,791 deaths in hospital. 3 Age and gender are well-established risk factors, with over 90% of UK deaths to date being in people aged over 60 years, and 60% of deaths in men, 4 consistent with global patterns. Various pre-existing conditions have been reported to correlate with increased risk of poor outcomes. In a re-analysis of a large aggregated case series dataset from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (44, 672 patients, 1,023 deaths), cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease, and cancers were all associated with increased risk of death. 5 These factors often correlate with age, but correction for age was not possible in the available data. More recently, a large UK cross-sectional survey describing 16,749 patients already hospitalised with COVID-19 showed higher risk of death for patients with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney disease, as well as malignancy, dementia and obesity (hazard ratios 1.19-1.39 after age and sex correction). 6 Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for treatment escalation in a French ITU cohort (n=124) and a New York hospital presentation cohort (n=3615). 7, 8 The risks associated with smoking are disputed: increased risks were initially reported; recent studies suggest that smokers are underrepresented among those with more severe disease; and a potential protective mechanism for nicotine has been suggested. 9 Smoking prevalence among hospitalised patients was lower than expected in China (1,099 patients, 12.6% vs 28% in the general population), 10 and in a small French study (139 outpatients and 343 inpatients; Standardized Incidence Ratios 0.197 and 0.246, respectively). 11 People from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups are at increased risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19, but explanations for this association are unclear. 12, 13 We therefore set out to determine factors associated with risk of death from COVID-19 in England using a very large sample of the adult population, with deaths data linked to longitudinal primary care electronic health records. This is the first iteration, based on the currently available data; further updates and additional outcomes will be released as more data become available through the OpenSAFELY.org platform.",

To be included in the study, participants were required to have at least 1 year of prior follow-up in the GP practice to ensure that baseline patient characteristics could be adequately captured, and to have a recorded sex and age. 19 Patients were observed from the 1st of February 2020 and were followed until the first of either their death date (whether COVID-19 related or due to other causes) or the study end date, 25th April 2020. For this analysis, CPNS death data were available up to 25th April 2020; ONS death data (used for censoring individuals who died without the outcome) were available to 16th April 2020; patient censoring for deaths due to other causes was therefore not possible during the last 9 days of followup (see Discussion, weaknesses; a sensitivity analysis is presented with all data censored at 6th April 2020 in appendix Table A1 ).",

The Kaplan-Meier failure function by age group and sex are shown in figure 2. For each potential risk factor, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted, with days in study as the timescale, stratified by geographic area (STP), and adjusted for sex and age modelled using restricted cubic splines. Violations of the proportional hazards assumption were explored by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. All potential risk factors, including age (again modelled as a spline), sex, BMI, smoking, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and comorbidities listed above were then included in a single multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by STP. Hazard ratios from the age/sex adjusted and fully adjusted models are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Models were also refitted with age group fitted as a categorical variable in order to obtain hazard ratios by age group.",

The scale of our platform will shortly expand further, and we will report updated analyses over time. Another key strength is our use of open methods: we pre-specified our analysis plan and have shared our full analytic code and all code lists for review and re-use. We ascertained patients' demographics, medications and comorbidities from their full pseudonymised longitudinal primary care records, providing substantially more detailed information than is available in hospital records or data recorded at time of admission alone, and on the total population at risk rather than the selected subset presenting for treatment in hospital. Linkage to ONS allowed censoring of data in the control population for patients who had died outside hospital or from other causes.

This could be partly or wholly due to the very large numbers included meaning small deviations are statistically significant, or due to unmeasured covariates. However, it may have been due to rapid changes in social behaviours following government advice on social distancing, shielding, and changes in the pattern and burden of infection across the UK, which may also have affected different patient groups differentially. A sensitivity analysis with early censoring at 6th April 2020 (before social distancing and shielding measures would be likely to affect mortality) showed no evidence of non-proportional hazards (p=0.56) and similar results to the primary model, but with larger hazard ratios for several risk factors. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the most at-risk patients may have been more compliant with social distancing and shielding policies introduced later. In contrast, the effect of increased deprivation appeared to be smaller in the earlier period, suggesting that the risk associated with deprivation may have increased over time. Subsequent analyses will explore different analytical approaches, including fitting interactions with time, and using accelerated failure time models, to further explore changes before and after national initiatives around COVID-19.",

Our findings, based on more detailed data, show that this is only a small part of the excess risk. Other possible explanations for increased risk among BME groups relate to higher infection risk, including over-representation in 'front-line\" professions with higher exposure to infection, or higher household density.

This contrasts with previous findings: in several countries, asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases are underrepresented in hospitalised patients; 48 and among the first few hundred cases in UK, a protective association with asthma was observed, although presence of asthma was ascertained differently for cases and controls which could be a source of bias. 36 The ISARIC study reported 14% of hospitalised patients having asthma but no increased risk of death. 6 However, in both the UK and China, COPD did appear to confer increased risk of death among hospitalised or confirmed cases, respectively. 5, 6 Our study design combines both risk of infection and risk of death once infected; it is also possible that our methodology captured more people with asthma and was better able to delineate more severe asthma than previous studies based on hospital records. We found no association between hypertension and death where hypertension was defined as a recorded diagnosis or high blood pressure at last measurement (HR 0.96, 0.9-1.02). However when separated out in sensitivity analyses diagnosed hypertension was associated with slightly increased risk, whilst a high blood pressure measurement was associated with slightly reduced risk.

We have demonstrated -for the first time -that only a small part of the substantially increased risks of death from COVID-19 among nonwhite groups and among people living in more deprived areas can be attributed to existing disease. Improved strategies to protect people in these groups from COVID-19 need urgent consideration.",

The statistical power offered by our approach means that associations with less common risk factors can be robustly assessed in more detail, at the earliest possible date, as the pandemic progresses. We will therefore update our findings and address smaller risk groups as new cases arise over time. The open source re-usable codebase on OpenSAFELY supports rapid, secure and collaborative development of new analyses: we are currently conducting expedited studies on the impact of various medical treatments and population interventions on the risk of COVID-19 infection, ITU admission, and death, alongside other observational analyses. OpenSAFELY is rapidly scalable for additional NHS patients' records, with new data sources progressing.",
