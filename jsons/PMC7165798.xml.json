            "text": "Zoonoses, diseases that can spread under natural conditions between humans and other animals (Last, 2001), are a major public health issue. In the last decade, Canada has experienced significant outbreaks of human illness caused by established and newly emergent zoonotic pathogens as varied as influenza A viruses, E. coli O157, Salmonella, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, West Nile virus and Campylobacter (O'Connor, 2002; Varia et al., 2003; Isaacs et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2006; Artsob et al., 2009; Cutler et al., 2009). Publicity surrounding incidents, such as the 2000 E. coli O157 outbreak in Walkerton, ON (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2000) and Salmonella contamination of various imported food items (e.g. peanut butter, tomatoes and peppers (Maki, 2009)), has raised awareness of food and waterborne transmission of such pathogens. However, only recently has more attention been focused on other sources of zoonotic diseases such as household pets, although the majority of the population has regular contact with companion animal species and that transmission of organisms such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), hookworms, roundworms, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, dermatophytes, Leptospira, Bartonella spp. can occur between people and pets (Lefebvre et al., 2006; Weese et al., 2006; Brown and Prescott, 2008; Pickering et al., 2008; Reaser et al., 2008; Salb, 2008). The increased attention on animal\u2010to\u2010human transmission of zoonoses from the medical and public health communities has raised awareness of the significant burden of zoonoses on the Canadian economy (Stephen et al., 2004). Sufficient knowledge and awareness amongst those responsible for the investigation of zoonotic disease incidents is vital to reducing this burden.",

One aspect that is hard to evaluate is true burden of zoonotic diseases, especially non\u2010foodborne and non\u2010reportable diseases, because there is limited surveillance and reporting. The lack of incidence and outcome information hampers understanding of the true impact of many zoonotic diseases. Whilst it is well established that horses can carry both MRSA and Salmonella, the risk of opportunistic transmission of zoonotic illnesses from horses to humans is thought to be low (Bender and Tsukayama, 2004), and PHIs who work outside of rural areas may not encounter horses in their investigations. However, persons who live in suburban or urban areas may have contact with horses at riding stables or petting zoos, and thus, the potential for animal contact should be investigated even in urban situations. Small pet mammals also can transmit a number of zoonoses (Reaser et al., 2008), but many of these zoonoses are not reportable (in humans) in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2010) and as such, often receive limited attention.",

Fewer than two\u2010thirds of respondents often or always asked about contact with animals in petting zoos/shows where relevant. Eleven respondents indicated that poultry could transmit rabies and 10% of respondents did not associate rabies with cats. As feline hunting and male roaming behaviours increase the risk of cats having contact with rabies vectors, including raccoons and bats, and cats are less likely to be vaccinated for rabies than dogs (Moore et al., 2000), it is important to consider cats a source of rabies. In fact, 70% of respondents who were involved in rabies exposure investigations reported involvement of cats in those incidents. Though many respondents may not investigate rabies exposures as part of their position, this apparent lack of knowledge about rabies, a disease with a near 100% fatality rate, raises concern.",

Also, 3\u201313% of respondents did not associate Salmonella with turtles, other reptiles or poultry. Although it is encouraging that the majority of respondents did associate Salmonella with these species, the proportion that did not is still a concern given the potentially significant impact on public health caused Salmonella in these species. Other points of concern were the lack of knowledge regarding toxoplasmosis in cats and Campylobacter in dogs. Many PHIs incorrectly identified tickborne pathogens as being directly transmitted from animals. These results suggest that PHIs need to be better educated about distinctions between direct and indirect methods of transmission. For instance, with a tickborne zoonosis, whilst an animal is not the source of the disease, it is infected in the same manner as humans, so animals may act as sentinel for human exposure.",

This suggests that connections between the human and animal health professions still need to be strengthened, and individuals in both groups should be made aware of sources of information regarding zoonotic illnesses and encouraged to seek further information when appropriate.",

Considering the significant impact emerging zoonotic diseases have had on the Canadian public health sector and the economy (e.g. SARS, H1N1 influenza, E. coli O157), it is important that training of PHIs on zoonotic illnesses does not end when they complete their formal education. The responses suggest improvements are needed in both the quality and quantity offered. One possible improvement in current CE suggested by this study is in the format. Conferences, then seminars and e\u2010mail bulletins were the most common form of current CE, but respondents preferred seminars, followed by e\u2010mail bulletins and websites. The overwhelming preference for seminars suggests that PHIs prefer forms of CE that involve in\u2010person (or videoconference) talks, but smaller blocks of time commitment. Websites and e\u2010mail bulletins allow for prompt communication of new information and allow PHIs to engage in CE according to their own schedules.",

A low response rate may result in the sampled population not being representative of the target population, and the results should be interpreted in this context. Responses were received from PHIs in only four of the ten provinces and territories represented on the survey mailing list. The reason(s) for the disparity in response rates is not known; one possibility is that the survey was not forwarded to listserv members in all provinces and territories on the list. In addition, the national CIPHI listserv only includes PHIs who are current members of CIPHI, and not all PHIs maintain CIPHI membership. Also, the respondent pool was heavily weighted towards those with more than 10 years of experience. Thus, caution should be taken in extrapolating the results to the whole of Canada or to all PHIs in Canada. However, respondents were most likely to work in mixed suburban/rural or urban areas, a statistic that reflects the distribution of populations in most provinces, and only 14% considered themselves to be in administrative roles. Thus, the data and results still provide a description of PHI knowledge, experience and education regarding zoonotic diseases.",

Use of the CIPHI mailing list was the only feasible way of contacting large numbers of PHIs, as CIPHI is the only organization that has a nationwide database of contact information for PHIs. Given the small sample size, no formal statistical analyses were carried out, and the data were described to provide a general picture of knowledge and opinions on investigations, education and CE, rather than to make specific conclusions. Additionally, the CIPHI listserv is not strictly limited to PHIs, and as the survey questions did not explicitly exclude non\u2010PHIs, it is possible that some respondents worked in other positions or were not actively practicing as PHIs. Finally, some of the survey questions referred to infectious diseases rather than specifically to zoonotic pathogens, so some responses may include non\u2010zoonotic diseases. However, as the survey referred repeatedly to zoonotic and directly transmitted pathogens and the majority of infectious diseases are zoonotic, the inclusion of non\u2010zoonotic pathogens is likely to be minimal.",

A majority of PHIs regularly investigate infectious diseases, including zoonoses. In addition, whilst most PHIs correctly identified the animals able to transmit common or well\u2010publicized zoonotic pathogens, there appeared to be some gaps in their knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies, tickborne illnesses and gastrointestinal pathogens in household pets. Further study would be of use in assessing whether PHIs are making sufficient inquiries about animal contact in their investigations. The survey responses also suggest a need for improvement in the quality and quantity of both initial and continuing education on zoonotic diseases in a wide variety of species. In particular, PHIs expressed interest in methods of continuing education that required less time commitment and allowed for more flexibility such as seminars and e\u2010mail bulletins.",
