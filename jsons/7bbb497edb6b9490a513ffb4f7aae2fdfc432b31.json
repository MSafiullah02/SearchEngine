The results of the study suggested that the viruses from these three SEAC might originate from different ancestors. The identification of PDCoV in SEAC suggests that the virus may have been in this region for some time, but has not been detected due to greater focus on PEDV variants. Although PDCoV was not detected in Philippines, it does not mean the virus was not there due to limited sample numbers from this area. The origin and source of introduction into Thailand, Lao PDR and Vietnam are still questionable. The viruses could have been in this region for some time, and continuously evolved until separated into different lineage, or the viruses were introduced from different ancestors or sources.
