We segmented the \u03a6X174 genome into 14 non-toxic and non-replicative fragments compatible with golden gate assembly. We next used nicking mutagenesis with oligonucleotides prepared from unamplified oligo pools with individual segments as templates to prepare near-comprehensive single-site mutagenesis libraries of genes encoding the F capsid protein (421 amino acids scanned) and G spike protein (172 amino acids scanned). Libraries possessed greater than 99% of all 11,860 programmed mutations. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete \u03a6X174 mutant genome and generate libraries of infective viruses. This protocol will enable reverse genetics experiments for studying viral evolution and, with some modifications, can be applied for engineering of therapeutically relevant bacteriophages with larger genomes.",

Understanding such changes are important for fundamental evolutionary studies as well as biotechnology applications like phage therapy for multi-drug resistant bacteria (Dedrick et al. 2019) . Two obstacles preventing better predictions are the oversimplification of the environment in experimental evolution studies compared to wild conditions and the vast number of experimentally unexplored mutational combinations that can occur, even in short adaptive walks and small genomes. Advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have opened new ways to study microbial evolution and overcome some of these obstacles (Barrick et al. 2013 , Fowler et al. 2014 . Unfortunately, suitable methods do not exist for generating comprehensive bacteriophage mutant libraries. This technology gap hinders those seeking to engineer phage for biotechnological applications and for those seeking a deeper understanding of how viruses evolve.",

            "text": "Methods for genetically engineering phages have recently been reviewed (Pires et al. 2016 ) and commonly involve homologous recombination and recombineering. While such approaches can be improved by clever incorporation of CRISPR-Cas systems (Kiro et al. 2014 , Lemay et al. 2017 , Schilling et al. 2018 , the overall modest efficiencies largely limits mutagenesis to the generation and single-site mutation of chimeric genomes (Doore and Fane 2015, Doore et al. 2017) , gene deletions (Uchiyama et al. 2009 ), and limited multi-site mutagenesis (Stockdale et al. 2015) . A recent approach combines mutagenesis by PCR with degenerate (NNK) primers with in-cell recombination to create variation at specific residues in the tail fiber of T3 phage (Yehl et al. 2019 We therefore suspected that large userdefined libraries of phage could be generated by combining the advantages of replicative plasmids with advances in DNA synthesis. The bacteriophage \u03a6X174 is an excellent system to test this approach. High resolution X-ray crystallography structures of the capsid and spike proteins (McKenna et al. 1992 , Dokland et al. 1997 are available for \u03a6X174, making it amenable to compare empirical mutagenesis results and molecular modeling predictions, it has a very small genome (Sanger et al. 1978) of 5,386 nucleotides that is readily sequenced, and it is easily grown on a variety of lab E. coli strains. These attractive features of the \u03a6X174 experimental system have led to proof-of-principle demonstrations from other groups for synthetic genome assembly from oligonucleotides (Smith et al. 2003) and complete refactoring of the phage (Jaschke et al. 2012 , Jaschke et al. 2018 ).",

When a gene is in multiple fragments, the number of mutational variants we expect from the assembled mutant fragments is the product of their individual variant number. Hence, since G1 contains 2640 variants and G2 contains 800 variants, they can be combined to generate 2.1 million double mutation variants. Further, nothing requires the fragments to be from the same gene. For example, since the F and G proteins bind to each other to form the capsid of phiX174 (Fig. 2) , libraries combining mutations in F with mutations in G will capture mutations that can readily interact in the protein and have the potential to generate interesting instances of epistasis (Fig 2) . The central challenge then becomes how to survey the vast size of these combinatorial plasmid libraries.

First, PCR was performed with overhang primers (Supplemental Table S1 ) to introduce the BbvCI site. Standard Phusion Polymerase HF reaction conditions were used with 4 ng of template DNA, cycling conditions as follows: 98\u00b0C -1 min, 25x cycles of: 98\u00b0C -10 seconds, 67\u00b0C 15 seconds, 72\u00b0C 2.5 minutes, followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR\u2122 safe stain (Invitrogen) and the DNA bands at ~4600 bp were extracted using a Monarch\u00ae DNA Gel Extraction Kit. Next, 1 \u03bcg of the PCR product was digested with KpnI (20 U) in NEB Buffer 1.1 at 37\u00b0C for two hours. Digested DNA was cleaned and concentrated with a Monarch\u00ae PCR and DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit and eluted into 20 \u03bcL nuclease free H2O. One microliter of the purified and digested DNA was ligated using T4 DNA ligase at ~25\u00b0C for 1 hour in standard conditions in a 20 \u03bcL reaction. Five microliters of the ligation reaction were transformed into chemically competent XL1-Blue E. coli via standard protocols. Cells were plated on LB agar containing 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ mL kanamycin and grown at 37\u00b0C for ~16 hours. Cells were picked from transformation plates and grown in 50 mL TB with 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin for ~12 hours, cells were pelleted, and DNA purified using compact midi-preps. . This oligo pool was used directly in NM without further amplification using 2 \u03bcg of the relevant golden gate plasmid as a template. Libraries were electroporated into high efficiency electrocompetent XL1-Blue E. coli (Agilent cat #:",

Aliquots of the cell lysates were added to 3 ml of \u03a6LB top agar containing 50 \u03bcl log-phage E. coli C cells and plated onto a \u03a6LB agar plate. After four to five hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, recombinant phage plaques were visible and plates were removed from the incubator. To verify that the recombinant phage encoded the intended sequence, we picked about 30 plaques for each intended mutational target and Sanger sequenced the entire targeted gene. We also sequenced the F and G genes for about 30 wildtype plaques to assure that no mutations were naturally accumulating. Briefly, individual plaques were picked with sterile toothpicks and placed in 200 uL \u03a6LB and gently swirled. 1 uL of this mix was used to PCR amplify approximately \u00bd of the \u03a6X174 genome using \u03a6X-0F (5'-GAGTTTTATCGCTTCCATG-3') and \u03a6X-2953R (5'-CCGCCAGCAATAGCACC-3') primers. Internal sequencing primers \u03a6X-979F (5'-CGGCCCCTTACTTGAGG-3') and \u03a6X-1500R (5'-TTGAGATGGCAGCAACGG-3') were used to sequence gene F. \u03a6X-2953R was used to sequence gene G. PCR cleanups and sequencing was done at Eurofins Genomics.

A single oligo pool encoding for all possible single missense and nonsense substitutions in F and G was designed using the custom python scripts from Medina et al. 2019 and custom synthesized by Agilent (full sequences of all oligos are given in the associated file \"VMA_supplemental_data. csv\"). Oligo pools were designed with 20-24 bases of gene overlap flanking the mutated codon. Codons were chosen based on E. coli codon usage frequency, where the highest frequency codon that encoded the mismatch mutation was selected. We printed 14,853 unique oligos, where 14,853 = 12,453 \u03a6X174 primers-2,400 other primers. These oligos encode WT (593 primers) and all 20 possible single point mutations (including stop) (11,860 primers)",

            "text": "). By contrast, human viruses often have reverse genetics systems in place where comprehensive mutant libraries can be prepared for single genes (Lee et al. 2018) or regions within a gene (Doud et al. 2018, Wu and Qi 2019) using replicative plasmids that encode whole viruses or viral components. Similarly, deep mutational scanning can be performed on plasmid-encoded phage proteins like the MS2 capsid protein (Hartman et al. 2018). As described by Hartman et al. 2018, such experiments can identify mutations that confer useful characteristics, such as MS2 capsid stability mutations that could improve the targeted delivery of therapeutics to particular cellular compartments. Advances in the technologies for generating mutant libraries, synthesizing DNA, and for the assembly of large DNA fragments (van Dolleweerd et al. 2018) allow for the construction and assembly of user-defined mutagenesis of long nucleic acids. Nicking mutagenesis (NM) can be used to construct comprehensive single-site or other user-defined mutant libraries (Wrenbeck et al. 2016) using dsDNA as a template. In NM, oligos encode the desired mutations by mismatch with the parental template. On-chip ink-jet printed oligo pools have been integrated into NM (Medina-Cucurella et al. 2019), so one can now construct heterogeneous libraries of oligos that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of high fidelity, unique sequences (Kosuri and Church 2014, Medina-Cucurella et al. 2019) with a low per base pair cost.",

Viral titers increase rapidly after 30 minutes, suggesting that the XL1-Blue cells do not burst until after this time point (SupplementalTable S5). Accordingly, we reasoned that the number of plaques at 30 minutes represents the number of XL1-Blue cells that were transformed with viable genomes.",
