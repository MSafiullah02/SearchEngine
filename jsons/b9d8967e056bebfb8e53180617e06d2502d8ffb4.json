Finally, we discuss the reliability of the model predictions, under certain conditions, for estimating the near and far future evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus experiences from mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying preexisting medical problems like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Yet, at present much needs to be understood about the effects of this new virus. COVID-19 spreads quickly, mainly through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The coronavirus in airborne droplets can survive for many tens of minutes and eventually sticks to surfaces and remains active up to many hours, depending on materials [2] . This fact could further increase the diffusion of the outbreak.",

Therefore, the fit reproduces well the time dependence including lock-down effects. R 0 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 1 (right). Errors on the fit parameters are very small and are not reported here because we believe they are not significant due to unknown uncertainties introduced by lock-down procedures and administration of medical tests. Yet, in Fig. 2 we show an error band taking into account two standard deviations determined from the fit residuals. From this figure we can deduce: 1/\u03b2 0 = 2.35 \u00b1 0.02 days and 1/\u03b3 = 38.2 \u00b1 0.7 days. In Fig. 3 we show the daily new and recovered+deceased cases calculated from\u0130 +\u1e58 and\u1e58, respectively. The SIR-T adopted model reproduces the time dependence of the data. This is not the case at the same statistical significance level for the SIRD-T model in eq. (4). In Fig. 4 we show the fit result for SIRD-T. As it is shown the D category is not described properly although the other categories are described better. For this fit it turns out that 1/\u03b2 0 \u223c 2.2 days and R 0 (0)=9.

These effects can be due to a strong lock-down procedure impact or to a sudden increase of the infection. In these cases the statistical model discussed in this work is not appropriate to account for important discontinuities in the data. However, it is worth mentioning that indeed the effect of the lock-down is evident in the data that we have analysed.
