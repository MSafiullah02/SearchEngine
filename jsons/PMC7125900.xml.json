            "text": "HIV-1 entry into target cells is a multistep process involving a series of viral proteins and host-cell receptors. The envelope glycoprotein assembly formed by gp120 and gp41, which decorate the surface of HIV-1, plays key roles in this process.1, 2, 3, 4 Gp120 engages CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors primarily on macrophages and CD4+ T cells and subsequently undergoes a conformational change, which activates (basically uncloaks) gp41. The ectodomain (extraviral) of gp41 consists of three important regions: an N-terminal fusion sequence that inserts into the target cell membrane, and two helical regions containing two hydrophobic heptad repeat units (denoted as the N- and C-helical regions, respectively). The N-HR regions of three gp41 molecules form a trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil. Upon dissociation of gp120 from the complex, a six-helix bundle forms in which the C-helical regions wrap around the inner coil in an antiparallel fashion (trimer-of-hairpins, Fig. 1\n). The formation of the six-helix bundle is essential for the complete fusion of the virus and target cell membranes.5 Notably, this mechanism of virus entry has also been observed in Ebola virus, Newcastle disease virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the corona virus. In all these cases the fusion glycoprotein forms a rod-shaped \u03b1-helical bundle.6\n",

Consequently, there is an extensive search for small (peptide-like) molecules that have the same mechanistic effect as T-20, but with improved pharmacological properties. Over the years, small simple14, 15 and constrained16, 17, 18 \u03b1-peptides, \u03b2-peptide,19 \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 peptides,20 aromatic foldamers,21\nd-peptides derived from phage display,22 and peptide-small molecule conjugates23 have been proposed. Generally, these inhibitors target only a hydrophobic pocket in the \u03b1-helical coiled-coil, which in the native protein is occupied by three \u03b1-helical residues found near the gp41 C-terminus: Trp628, Trp631, and Ile635 (the WWI epitope).24, 25, 26 Schepartz et al. prepared a series of \u03b23-decapeptides in which the WWI epitope is presented on one face of a short 14-helix.19 It was shown that these \u03b2-peptides bind to a gp41 model in vitro and inhibit gp41-mediated fusion in cell culture. Activities were similar to other small molecules reported before (IC50 values between 5 and 26 \u03bcM, respectively), but much less potent than Fuzeon (which has an IC50 value of 0.11 nM).27 However, compared to Fuzeon these \u03b23-decapeptides have the advantage of being one-third the size, having higher metabolical stability and being amenable to (combinatorial) optimization.",

            "text": "Although appealing, the \u03b2-peptide foldamers (or better the 14-helix) may not present the optimal scaffold for expressing the WWI epitope, because of the relatively large difference between the 14- and the native \u03b1-helix.28 Rather, an attractive alternative may be the expression of the WWI epitope on a small 310-helix, which bears much closer resemblance to the \u03b1-helix. The 310-helix is induced in small oligopeptides (down to 7\u20138 residues) when more than 4\u20135 \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues are present, exposing amino acids in i and i+3 positions on the same face of the helix.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Like the \u03b2-peptides, C\u03b1-tetrasubstituted amino acids increase the metabolic stability of the resulting peptides. Previously, Sia et al. have reported on the inhibition of HIV-1 entry using short peptides (14 residues) that were conformationally constrained either by using covalent linkers or Aib.17 Based on these studies they concluded that no correlation exists between the inhibitory potency and the helical content of the oligopeptides. However, it should be noted that none of the peptides showed any helicity at all when free in solution. This can be explained by the small number of Aibs present (2) and the rather arbitrary sites of covalent side-chain linkers. The trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled coil forms an interesting target also from the perspective of multivalency, which relates directly to current interests in our group. The C\n3-symmetry of the \u03b1-helical bundle implies that three identical binding sites for the WWI epitope are present. Template constructs have been used to stabilize the N-terminal peptide of gp41, with the purpose of inducing immunological reactions or simply as stable target for the development of fusion inhibitors.35, 36 Conversely, a significant gain in binding affinity may be observed when multiple copies of the inhibitory peptide are connected to a scaffold molecule (with appropriate flexible spacers that can span the required distance). Following this approach, three copies of T-20 were ligated to a scaffold molecule by Tam and Yu.30 Preliminary results showed a modest 10-fold increase in inhibitory potency with respect to the monomeric peptide, which may be related to the rather small linkers used to connect the three copies together. In contrast, dimerization and trimerization of non helical d-peptide binders of gp41 selected by phage display resulted in increased antiviral activity by 300- and 2500-fold, respectively, over the monomeric version (PIE7).22b Alternatively, Wang and co-workers used a monosaccharide as scaffold to link up to four copies of T-20 in order to be used as an immunogen for raising high-titer antibodies against HIV-1.38 From a more fundamental point of view, it would be interesting to determine the interactions between three 310-helices connected to a scaffold, which potentially may lead to superstructures such as a trimeric coiled coil.39, 40\n",

This is likely due to the fact that the Wang resin is not particularly stable under MW irradiation. Indeed we have observed (data not reported) that the PAL resin, a polyethylene glycol-based resin with a very high degree of crosslinking, is much more compatible with MW irradiation (yield increased to ca. 35%).",

After removal of the protecting groups the scaffold has three amino groups at the ends, which can be reacted with an Fmoc\u2013PEG spacer (20)\u2013OH and, subsequently, to the peptide taking advantage of the presence of the carboxylate in the C\u03b1 of Asp at the C terminus.

They are reported in Fig. 7\n. The spectrum of 1 in pH 7 aqueous buffer indicates a folded conformation. The minima at ca. 203 and 230 nm lend support to a not-fully-structured 310 helix (as in the case of sequences presenting tertiary amides and, hence, were not all H-bonds are possible). The shift to lower wavelengths of the shallower, higher wavelength band by addition of TFE indicates increased 310 helix content in this solvent. A right-handed 310-helix shows a negative Cotton band centered at ca. 208 nm (\u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217) with a shoulder at ca. 222 nm (n\u2192\u03c0\u2217, \u03b8\n222/\u03b8\n208 ca. 0.3).45 Thus peptide 1 fulfills our expectation of a partly helical conformation, more structured in the presence of TFE. The situation in the case of the tripodal template is different as our data show that the peptides appear to be already folded even without the addition of TFE as the two negative bands are now centered at 205 and 225 nm. With respect to peptide 1, the conformation of 2 is shifting, at least in part, from a 310 helix toward an \u03b1-helix as the 222 nm negative band becomes more pronounced. We have reported that, in polar solvents, conformationally stable, Aib-rich, short peptides shift from a 310- to an \u03b1-helix.46 This conformational equilibrium is controlled by the polarity of the solvent and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising it shifts back to a 310 helix in a less polar membrane environment.",

One cell type expresses the viral envelope protein, which is responsible for binding to the receptor and triggering cell fusion. The other cell type expresses the target receptor, CD4. The cytoplasm of one population also contains bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, while the cytoplasm of the other contains a transfected plasmid with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the T7 promoter. When the two populations are mixed, cell fusion causes mixing of the cytoplasms and consequently activation of the lacZ gene in the cytoplasm of the fused cell; the resulting \u03b2-galactosidases activity can be measured colorimetrically. Recombinant vaccinia viruses are used as vectors to transfect two populations of NIH 3T3 cells with the exogenous genes described above.",

It has been show that for C14 peptides, helical content is not necessarily correlated with activity, and in fact over-constraining the peptide may result in loss of activity, possibly because the peptide can be locked in an inactive conformation.17 Nevertheless, reducing the conformational entropy of the peptide can translate into higher biological activity, even in the absence of strong effects on structure formation.17, 18 In contrast, the tripodal conjugate 2 exhibited inhibitory activity quantified with an IC50 of 60\u00b15 \u03bcM; this value compares well with the activity of other peptidomimetic agents.37 While the inhibitory activity is lower than we anticipated, we note that we do observe a strong multivalent effect in the template tripodal peptide. We hypothesize that the tripod stabilizes the helical conformation via controlled oligomerization, while simultaneously allowing enough flexibility for multivalent interactions.",

Peptide 1 is characterized by a very high helical content with a prevailing 310-helix conformation as the consequence of the presence of five Aib in its sequence. The tripodal template 2 is even more structured than 1 thus suggesting a significant interaction between the three sequences connected to the platform. Microwave irradiation proved indispensable for the synthesis of 1 while the synthesis of 2 was better performed step by step following our protocol on solid phase with the critical activation of the carboxylic acids as the fluoride and the use of N,O-bis(trymethylsilyl)acetamide for the coupling of the amine. Preliminary inhibition assays of HIV-mediated cell fusion indicated that while the single peptide 1 is practically inactive, when it is conjugated to the tripodal platform, it is moderately active. These promising results suggest that our approach constitute a valid alternative to those reported so far. Optimization of the platform to ensure a better match between the tripodal conjugate and its target is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",
