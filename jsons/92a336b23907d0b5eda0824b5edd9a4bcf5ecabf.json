CAP aetiology is difficult to establish and it is often multifactorial: viral and bacterial. A considerable number of childhood pneumonias is caused by viruses; in particular, viral infections appear to occur mostly in younger patients [1] . Commonly identified viruses in children with CAP include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (Flu) A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human Coronavirus (hCoV) [2] . Ample evidence describes that RSV is the most commonly detected virus in hospitalized children less than 5 years old, both as single virus and as coinfection [2] . Varghese L. et al. characterized epidemiology and clinical features of hCoVs (HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) in children and they found that the proportion of all identified hCoVs was highest among 1-5 years old. They detected hCoVs both in a community cohort and in hospitalized children and they reported an increased clinical severity in hospitalized children with young age and comorbidity; however, the clinical severity was not associated with hCoVs type [3] .",

COVID-19 became a pandemic and it has affected hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Surprisingly, only a small number of cases of COVID-19 has been described in children, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population is unusual [6] . Analysing clinical features of COVID-19 hospitalized paediatric patients, Chinese preliminary studies reported polypnea, fever and cough as the most common symptoms; a high rate of these patients presented unilateral or bilateral pulmonary lesions on chest computed tomography [7] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza type B. The aim of the present study was to examine viral aetiologies in children less than 14 years old hospitalized with pneumonia from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. In particular, the most interesting aspect was to test the SARS-CoV-2 presence and its diffusion among our paediatric population. hMPV and human Bocavirus (hBoV), as described [8] . Real-Time PCR reactions targeting the RdRp and the E-genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed in-house following the protocols described by Corman et al [9] . Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by Real-Time PCR reactions on DNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs, as described [10] . Demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were systematically collected. On hospital admission, we assigned each child a clinical severity score (from 0 to 8) according to respiratory rate, oxygen saturation in room air, presence of retractions and ability to feed [8] . A chest X ray was obtained in all children and radiological findings were classified as single pulmonary consolidation, multiple pulmonary consolidations or interstitial findings. Table 1) .",

According to previous studies, no significant laboratory and radiological differences between children hospitalized for pneumonia were observed. Since the enrollment period partially overlapped with COVID-19 peak infection in Italy, we investigated also SARS-CoV-2 distribution in children hospitalized with CAP in a tertiary University Hospital in Rome. Kelvin AA et al. suggest that children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but frequently they do not have notable disease, raising the possibility that they could be facilitators of viral transmission [11] . In our population, we detected two cases of HKU1, an HCoV belonging to the same genus beta of SARS-CoV-2, but no children with CAP tested positive for the novel CoV. These results seem consistent with several recent papers who have demonstrated that children appear to be less susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [6, 12] . Reasons remain unclear [12] . Despite some evidences describing pneumonia as the most frequent clinical manifestation among COVID-19 hospitalized children [7] , in our population, in Rome, no children tested positive for COVID-19, even PICU admitted ones.",

Written informed consent was obtained from parents or caregivers before enrollment. The study protocol was approved by Policlinico Umberto I ethic committee. Every patient underwent a nasal wash for the detection of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and a pharyngeal swab for Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection; all specimens were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Nasal washings were obtained injecting 3 ml of sterile saline solution into each nostril and then collected with a syringe. A panel of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nested PCR methods have been used for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses, included RSV, hRV, Flu A and B, PIV 1-3, ADV, CoV OC43, 229E, NL-63, HUKI,",

In 42 children studied, 31/42 (74%) had at least one virus detected; of these, 7/42 (17%) had a coinfection (6 RSV-hRV and 1 hRV-hMPV). M. pneumoniae was identified in 4/42 (10%) children, including 2 (5%) coinfections with hRV. The only hCov detected was HUK1 in 2/42 children (5%); none of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analysing all detected pathogens, hRV was the most frequently detected agent (17/42, 40.5%), followed by RSV (12/42, 28.5%) and Flu A and B (6/42 14.3%). Concerning viruses' distribution, hRV peaked in December-January (12/17, 70.5%), RSV in December (8/12, 66.6%) and Flu A and B were exclusively found in February (6/6, 100%) (Figure 1). Moreover, we focused on clinical features of patients with only virus detected and we found that children infected with RSV had a highest clinical severity score. Children infected with CoV-HKU1 were the youngest. Laboratory findings showed no significant differences. Considering radiological features, 50% of patients with hRV had a single pulmonary consolidation, while children positive for RSV had a high rate of multiple pulmonary consolidations (83.3%) (",
