To the current long-term follow-up analysis, we included all the steroid-naive children aged 3 to 23 months with their first severe wheezing episode from both studies (Fig 1\n).1, 4, 18 The exclusion criteria were use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) or systemic corticosteroids before study entry, chronic nonatopic disease, and a need for intensive care.1, 18 The studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital and commenced only after obtaining written informed consent from the guardians.",

Multivariable analyses were adjusted with eczema, any sensitization, parental smoking, rhinovirus positivity, and age less than 12 months at study entry, all of which showed significant effects. Logistic regression analyses were also done for atopic and nonatopic asthma outcomes separately. Because of the time difference of the 2 cohorts (recruited either in 2000-2002 or 2007-2010), we also adjusted for cohort in the multivariable regression analyses to study whether a cohort was significant in the models or modified the magnitude of the other factors in the models. The effect of overlapping risk factors on the incidence of asthma at age 8 years was tested with \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests. A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Analyses were made with IBM SPSS 23.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, Ill).",

These results are noteworthy because currently the school-age asthma risk of children with recurrent wheezing episodes is evaluated by using the modified API, which includes closely atopy-related characteristics but does not differentiate between asthma phenotypes.10, 11 The risk factors for nonatopic asthma were first wheezing before age 12 months, parental smoking, and the RSV/rhinovirus-negative first wheezing episode.",

Previously, early-life rhinovirus-induced wheezing has been linked to school-aged asthma in birth cohorts.6, 7 However, the Childhood Origins of Asthma and the Australian birth cohort studies are high-risk cohorts because of including only wheezing children with a familial predisposition to atopic asthma. Therefore the data might reflect a different susceptibility of atopic airways to rhinovirus infections. On the contrary, the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study is a nonselected population-based birth cohort that included healthy infants. These investigators observed that children with early-life RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infections had frequent wheeze by school age, but the risk of wheezing decreased, being insignificant by age 13 years.30 In addition, there was no link between RSV infections and sensitization.30 Previous studies on different childhood asthma phenotypes noticed that atopic risk factors from the modified API were associated with atopic but not nonatopic asthma.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31 However, their study settings were different from ours because they were conducted on birth cohorts, not focused on the first wheezing episode,8, 12, 13, 14 included older children,12 or included no virus etiology of the wheezing.8, 12, 13, 14 Unlike these studies, we found no clear asthma-reducing effect from breast-feeding or, conversely, an asthma-increasing effect from male sex.8, 12, 13, 14 We showed that parental smoking predicted nonatopic asthma.8, 12, 13 On the contrary, parental asthma was insignificant in the univariable model and thus was not included in the multivariable model. However, it was associated with atopic asthma with concomitant rhinovirus and/or atopic risk factors.",

Therefore our results could be adapted to hospitalized first-time wheezing children and might provide new perspective when estimating their future asthma risk. B\u00f8nnelykke et al32 found no specific viral or bacterial risk factors for school-aged asthma and hence suggested that the underlying susceptibility to triggers instead of the specific triggering agent was the important asthma risk factor. We agree with the host-dependent susceptibility but suggest a trigger dependence so that rhinovirus itself would act as an important early marker uncovering the underlying susceptibility to asthma in atopic asthma-prone children by manifesting expiratory wheezing.1, 4, 9, 21 Like B\u00f8nnelykke et al,32 we did not find rhinovirus to be a risk factor for current overall asthma (including atopic and nonatopic), but we did find it to be a significant risk factor for atopic asthma. Concurrently, RSV/rhinovirus-negative wheezing was associated with nonatopic asthma, probably because the children with rhinovirus-positive wheezing had atopic asthma. Infant wheezing might be an asthma risk marker because it often is rhinovirus induced, particularly in older children.6, 19 However, the rhinovirus-induced wheezing has been included in asthma-predictive indices in a limited way. We suggest that the investigation of virus etiology, sensitization, and eczema status, and especially the combination of these 3, might enable the asthma risk assessment already at the time of the first wheezing episode because rhinovirus-sensitive viral diagnostics are widely available.1, 2, 4, 7, 19, 21, 33\n",

The inclusion rate was high (93%), 100% of the children were followed up from patient charts, and 57% of the children attended the study visit at age 8 years. This study set-up is different from birth cohort studies by being population-based, with all children experiencing their first severe wheezing episode.31 They were steroid naive; that is, they received no ICS/OCS before or as a treatment for this first wheezing. This is of note because it has been shown that OCSs can affect long-term asthma outcomes.1, 4, 9, 18, 20 To minimize selection bias, we included children who did not attend the long-term study visit. People adhere to follow-up studies that concern their interests, in our case asthmatic patients. To maximize the objectivity, we regarded children with bronchial hyperreactivity in spirometry as asthmatic patients who were without a proper pediatrician-set asthma diagnosis. This reflects the real-life situation and completes the asthma outcome. To minimize the heterogeneity and make our results more generalizable, we included only children with physician-confirmed wheezing (vs bronchiolitis with or without wheezing in previous studies).17\n",

On the contrary, first wheezing episode before age 12 months, parental smoking, and RSV/rhinovirus-negative first wheezing episode predict nonatopic asthma at school age. This observation could provide a novel approach to the mechanisms underlying childhood wheezing and asthma, prognostics, and potentially different therapies of distinct asthma phenotypes.15 It would be encouraging to find future therapeutic interventions to prevent asthma, but this warrants further study.16 Virology and atopic status are worth assessing early in children with severe wheezing to recognize those at high asthma risk and to distinguish the risk between asthma phenotypes.Key messages\n\u2022Sensitization, eczema, and rhinovirus etiology at the first severe wheezing episode predict atopic asthma at school age, whereas RSV/rhinovirus-negative etiology, age less than 12 months, and parental smoking predict nonatopic asthma.\u2022The data suggest diverse asthma phenotypes and mechanisms that can be predicted by using simple clinical markers at the time of the first severe wheezing episode.
