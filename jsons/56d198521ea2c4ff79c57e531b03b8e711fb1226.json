This and other analysis tools, e.g. time series analysis, require specialized visual support. The core PRA component, the autonomous Investigator, is due to change. The current investigator uses patterns -predefined sequences of tools that are run in parallel. In the future, it should be able to adjust its exploration plan on the fly. In principle, the output of its work could be presented in the simple list of tasks, as in Fig. 2(b) , but we plan to develop more friendly interface for the investigator.",

The data collection and the tool inventory will be expanded in the near future.",
