Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode an envelope (E) protein, which is a small, hydrophobic membrane protein; the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 has high homology with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. (SARS-CoV) In this study, we provide insights into the function of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel and the ion and water permeation mechanisms on the basis of combined in silico methods. Our results suggest that the pentameric E protein promotes the penetration of monovalent ions through the channel. Analysis of the potential mean force (PMF), pore radius and diffusion coefficient reveals that Leu10 and Phe19 are the hydrophobic gates of the channel. In addition, the pore demonstrated a clear wetting/dewetting transition with monovalent cation selectivity under transmembrane voltage, which indicates that it is a hydrophobic voltage-dependent channel. Overall, these results provide structural-basis insights and molecular-dynamic information that are needed to understand the regulatory mechanisms of ion permeability in the pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel.",

As of May 6, 2020, millions of cases have been confirmed, and hundreds of thousands have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global pandemic for COVID-19 in March 2020. In addition to the hazards of the disease itself, it has also led to a severe turbulence in international financial markets and may cause serious consequences such as a financial crisis. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It is speculated that it originated from bats and was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host (some kind of wildlife). Its symptoms include fever, general malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress. Comparing similar diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which are also caused by coronaviruses, the mortality rates for SARS and MERS were 10% and 36%, respectively 1 . Currently, COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 1 to 10% in different countries but appears to be more contagious than SARS and MERS 2 3 4 5 .",

Evidence suggests that the E protein maintains its morphology after virus assembly by interacting with the M protein 10 11 12 . When an E protein gene mutation occurs, it promotes apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that coronaviruses have a viroporin that can self-assemble into a pentameric structure and have ion selectivity. When there is a transmembrane voltage, the ion channel characteristics of viroporins are more significant. In addition, the Asn25Ala and Val18Phe mutations could destroy ion channel activity 13 . This indicates that the E protein may play an important role in regulating the ion equilibrium inside and outside the viral envelope.",

Subsequently, a 1000 ns (1 \u00b5s) MD simulation was performed to evaluate the stability of pentameric E protein embedded in the membrane environment. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the model is shown in Figure 2 , and the red and blue curves represent the whole protein and TM region, respectively. In the first 200 ns, the RMSD continued to rise, indicating that the model needed longer optimization (compared with other ion channels) to reach the pentameric structure equilibrium.

Z M is defined as the axial direction along the pore, which is from -3 ~ 3 nm (the length of umbrella sampling is 6 nm in total). From the PMF curve, we found that the energy barriers of monovalent and divalent ions have a significant difference.

In contrast, the PMFs of the monovalent ions Na + and K + are ~ 12 kJ/mol and ~20 kJ/mol, respectively, while the Cl-energy barrier is ~ 30 kJ/mol, which is significantly smaller than that of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ .

Intriguingly, we did not observe Clconduction, which may be because chloride ions could not overcome the energy barrier under the maximum transmembrane voltage. In addition, the change in the pore radius at different voltages highlights two important sites, where the geometric radius changes the most, corresponding to Leu10 and Phe19. Phe19 contains a benzene ring group at the hydrophobic surface of the inner pore as a hydrophobic gate. The isopropyl group of Leu10 at the bottom of the pore prevents the reverse penetration (Fig 6A) . Previous studies indicated that Asn15Val and Val25Phe mutations will make the channel dysfunctional. This may be due to the additional side chain groups in the pores caused by these mutations (especially the benzene ring in Val25Phe), making 1) the radius of the pores decrease and 2) the hydrophobicity of the pores increase. In short, these mutations may increase the energy barrier, negatively affecting the wetting transition and causing the channel to be functionally closed.",

We restrained the E-protein pentamer helix backbones and made the side chains, membrane, water and ions free to move. Due to the ion selectivity is related to the side chain of inner pore 61 , the backbone restraint maintained the E-protein pentamer tertiary structure but the side-chain flexibility in the inner pore was not influenced. A K + as the probe ion, the calculation system was used in the same manner as for umbrella sampling. The ion mean-square displacement (MSD) was calculated along the pore's Z-axis. A total of 25 simulation systems were obtained, each widows interval distance of the K + being set as 0.24 nm. The umbrella restraint was used to maintain the K + ion's position on the x-y plane of the pore. The Einstein equation MSD=2D(z)t was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient by the protocol g_msd. The umbrella restraint can be disregarded for these analyses because of the restraint force was negligible compared to thermally induced RMS fluctuations.",

The initial single layer system was equilibrium for 50 ns to make the structures stable. Then the single-layer system was duplicated along the z direction.

Computational electrophysiology Previous electrochemical experiments have shown that the transmembrane voltage has an important effect on the pore permeability for the E protein in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 23 24 . In addition, viroporins and similarly nanopores are sensitive to transmembrane voltage, causing electrowetting of the pores and changing the tension on the hydrophobic surface inside the pores, which is enough to functionally open the channels 30 31 32 33 . We used the computational electrophysiology first proposed by Kutzner et al. This approach expands the membrane protein structure into a \"sandwich\" and simulates the transmembrane voltage by adjusting the number of ions at different layers. It can directly simulate and analyze the ion penetration in the presence of transmembrane voltage at an atomic resolution. The sandwich structure of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer is presented inFigure 4A. A total of 4 models were established to simulate the charge differences between the two sides of the channel (\u0394Q = 12e, 8e, 4e, and 0e). Using the method described above, the transmembrane voltage was calculated as \u0394U = ~ 0.45 V, 0.3 V, 0.15 V, and 0 V, respectively (Fig 4B).",

The scatter represents the absolute counts of water molecules, and the color curve represents after smoothing (n = 25) using the Fast Fourier Fransformation (FFT) method. B, Normalized probability histogram of the water counts in the TM region for 20 ns simulations. The different colors represent different models: 0e (blue), 4e (red), 8e (blue) and 12e (magenta).Effect of transmembrane voltageTrick et al. indicated that the behavior of water molecules in pores can be used as a reasonable method to study the ion permeability of channels27 . Many works have shown that water influx into hydrophobic pores may help ions overcome the energy barrier on hydrophobic surfaces34 35  . Overall, we could speculate the ion penetrability of the E protein pentamer by the statistical number of water molecular counts in the inner pore.To accurately assess the behavior of water molecules in the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer pores, we performed six 20 ns simulations for each transmembrane voltage, and the total simulation time reached ~0.5 \u00b5s. Subsequently, the water molecules at different transmembrane voltages were counted (the statistical data of the changes in the molecule counts are shown in the Supplementary Word Film). We extracted representative water molecule diagrams for each voltage, as shown inFigure 5A.When \u0394Q = 0e, the average time for the channel to keep wetting is ~ 3 ns. \u0394Q = 4e is slightly longer (~ 5 ns). The absolute number of water molecules in the pore is small, with the average ranging from 0 to 5(Fig 5B). Although the pores are functionally open for water permeation, due to the small stream of water, they may not be able to maintain sufficient electrical wetting, resulting in ions that cannot permeate unimpeded. We speculate that at the maximum physiological voltage (~0.2 V), the SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein pore can only permeate a few water molecules.The number of water molecules increased significantly when \u0394Q = 8e or 12e (\u0394U = ~ 0.3 V, 0.45 V), and the water distributions were 4-20 (8e) and 15-27 (12e) (The process of water permeation see supplementary Movie 1). The pores remained in a wetting state. The experiment shows that the maximum \u0394U = 0.45 V is not enough to cause electrical breakdown of the lipid bilayer36 , indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel is activated by transmembrane voltage. Additionally, we observed that a few water molecules were able to be cotransported with Na + and K + during the simulations (SeeSupplementary Movie 2 and 3). Interestingly, as the voltage increased, the permeability of water molecules also increased synchronously, showing a periodic change regardless of the magnitude of the transmembrane voltage (even if \u0394U = 0). The calculation suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer channel has obvious wetting/dewetting transitions and that it has the typical characteristics of voltage-dependent hydrophobic channels.",

Phe19 and Leu10 are located at the top and bottom of the pore, respectively. The two positions show a candidate gated area of the channel. Figure 6A shows that these two locations have obvious \"bottlenecks\", which are not large enough for water permeation. This was also confirmed by the calculation of the channel radius on different transmembrane voltages. The radius of the pore obviously increased with transmembrane voltage at the two locations. In the open state (\u0394U=0 V), the pore radius increased to 2 nm and 2.2 nm. When the transmembrane voltage increased to \u0394U = ~ 0.15 V and 0.3 V, the radius of the pore at the Leu10 position was ~ 0.23 nm and 0.28 nm, and the radius of the pore at Phe19 was ~0.25 nm and 0.33 nm, respectively. The voltage had a greater influence on Phe19 than on Leu10. However, for \u0394U = 0.45 V, the radius of the pore was still ~ 0.33 nm at Phe19 but had expanded to 0.4 nm at Leu10, indicating that the large transmembrane voltage may make Leu10 excessively available, which may cause the unidirectional permeation to be destroyed. The narrowest locations of the inner pore are consistent with the energy barrier. Apparently, the radius of the inner pore showed that Leu10 and Phe19 of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein are candidate hydrophobic gates.",

We characterized and estimated the channel's stability, energy barrier, voltage dependence and geometric properties by using MD simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer is a voltage-dependent hydrophobic channel with monovalent cation selectivity. Water molecules and monovalent cations can penetrate through the channel spontaneously under a transmembrane voltage. Differences in the penetrability of E protein channels may be responsible for the infectivity, inflammatory response and incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, which is different from that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The results further suggested that Leu10 and Phe19 are hydrophobic gates for ion regulation and permeability.
