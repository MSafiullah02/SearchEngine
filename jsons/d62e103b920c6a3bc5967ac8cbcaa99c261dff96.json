The emergence of lamivudine resistance is detected by a rise in HBV viral load and confirmed by sequencing the active site of the DNA polymerase gene\u2022 The presence of HBV pre-core mutants may cause active liver disease despite the absence of HBeAg, the common marker for active hepatitis in hepatitis B infection . This may be due to either a premature stop codon point mutation in the pre-core gene (G1896A) or a mutation in the basal core promoter region downregulating HBeAg production, both of which can only be reliably detected genotypically bp double-stranded linear DNA virus (Figure 16) with 162 hexagonal protein capsomeres surrounded by three distinct layers : a matrix or tegument , a capsid, and an outer envelope \u2022 CMV can reside latent in the salivary glands cells, endothelium, macrophages, and lymphocytes.

Early genes facilitate DNA replication and result in the transcription and translation of the late genes (Figure 26) \u2022 Adenovirus produces cytolysis in different tissues and induces host inflammatory responses and cytokine production 572 \u2022 Transmission of adenovirus is via direct contact , the fecaloral route, and occasionally waterborne transmission and occurs usually during infancy or adolescence Clinical Presentation \u2022 Most adults have measurable titers of anti-adenovirus antibodies, implying prior infection. However, most infections are asymptomatic \u2022 Some adenovirus types can establish persistent subclinical infections in tonsils , adenoids, and intestines of infected hosts with viral shedding occurring for as long as several months to years \u2022 Adenovirus may infect multiple organ systems and is recognized as the etiologic agent of a variety of diverse syndromes: acute respiratory disease, pharyngoconjunctival fever, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, acute hemorrhagic cystitis , gastroenteritis, and adenoviral infections in immunocompromised hosts U .,!!=J~'> VI Fig. 25.

Primary human embryonic kidney cells support growth of many fastidious adenovirus serotypes, but the additional cost may be prohibitive in some settings. Adeno-associated virus has also been known to contaminate this cell line. Other cell line s may not support the growth of ocular strains well, may be less sensitive , or may not be maintainable to support slower-growing strains \u2022 Serologic studies -Seroreactivity to adenovirus is common. Positive adenovirus titer s occur in 50% of individuals >4 years old -Serology is less useful in the acute clinical setting -For a serologic diagnosis, serum should be obtained as early as possible in the clinical course, followed by a second titer 2-4 weeks later.

The virion is variable in shape and size (120-300 nm), is unstable in the environment (surviving only a few hours on environmental surfaces), and is readily inactivated with soap and water and disinfectants \u2022 RSV is a labile paramyxovirus that produces a characteristic fusion of human cells (syncytial effect) in tissue culture \u2022 RSV is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus \u2022 RSV has two heterotypic strains of viruses that are antigen ically distinct, and are classified as subgroups AandB 574 \u2022 The major difference between these subgroups is the antigenic properties of the G surface glycoprotein \u2022 Transmission is from aerosolized respiratory droplets via close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces \u2022 Most prevalent in infants aged 2-6 months, but children of any age with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease or who are immunocompromised are at risk for serious complications from RSV infection Clinical Presentation \u2022 RSV infections typically occur in temperate climates during late fall through early spring \u2022 Two subtypes have been identified . Subtype A involves a severe clinical presentation and predominates in most outbreaks. Subtype B predominates in most asymptomatic strains of the virus that the majority of the population experiences \u2022 RSV bronchiolitis presents with a 2-3-day \"pro-dromal\" phase, which resembles a common viral upper respiratory tract infection. Additional symptoms include rhinorrhea, wheezing, coughing, low-grade fever, and pneumonia.

It is the first example of a coronavirus causing serious disease in humans \u2022 The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is 29,272 nucleotides in length with 41% being Gte residues \u2022 SARS is spread mainly through contact with infected saliva or droplet s from coughing. Vertical transmission from mother to infant does not appear to occur The SARS virus produces an atypical pneumonia that often leads to respiratory failure, with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation similar to that seen with adult respiratory distress syndrome \u2022 During the early phase of the disease, fever >38\u00b0C is the hallmark symptom. This finding is often associated by myalgia, rigors, and other flu-like symptoms \u2022 During the second week, patients develop a dry, non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and lung infiltrates with rapid progression to respiratory distress \u2022 The cause of death is respiratory failure, with the best predictor of mortality being old age \u2022 Except for ventilation, no effective treatment is currently available \u2022 Respiratory sample: nasal wash, nasopharyngeal swab, BAL, bronchial wash, or sputum \u2022 Transport: I mL (minimum volume 0.5mL for adult s and pediatrics) respiratory sample in viral transport media (Microtest M4) or in sterile leak-proof container at 2-8\u00b0C \u2022 Unacceptable conditions: dry swabs are not acceptable. Respiratory aspirates collected in containers with tubing as samples tend to leak, compromising the specimen Conventional Tests and Problems \u2022 Viral culture -Requires biological safety level (BSL)-3 facility -Difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individual late in the outbreak during late stages of illness due to possible genetic drift of virus \u2022 Serologic studies -Utility of serologic testing is poor due to late seroconversion of infected patients, i.e., 2--4 weeks \u2022 Multiple RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect SARS RNA in clinical specimens utilizing nested, nonnested, one-step or two-step conventional, or real-time TaqMan assays \u2022 PCR primers and probe target various regions: polymerase (pol) lb region of 5' replicase, nucleocapsid (nuc) genes , and the 3' non-coding region of the genome \u2022 LightCycler SARS-CoV Quantitation kit (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) for use with the LightCycler instrument Molecular Genetic Pathology -Ready-to-use , which amplifies a 180-bp target sequence of the replicase 1AB/polymerase gene of SARS CoY \u2022 RealArt HPA-Coronavirus RT PCR Kits (Artus) for use with the LightCyler instrument, the ABI Prism 7000, 7700, and 7900H instruments -Amplifies an 80-bp region of the SARS -CoV genome \u2022 EraGen Biosciences MultiCode-RTx (Eragen Biosciences, Madison, WI) (research only)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF28": {"text": "\u2022 A negative result does not rule out SARS as the presence of PCR inhibitors in the patient specimen, poor RNA quality, or nucleic acid concentrations below the LOD of the assay may occur Clinical Utility \u2022 During the first week, serum and plasma are preferred for RT-PCR. Between 1-3 weeks, these sample types are less effective; stool and respiratory samples are the preferred types. After 3 weeks, stool is the preferred sample type for RT-PCR. Viral load in the upper respiratory tract and feces is low during the first 4 days of infections and peaks at approximately the 10th day of illness \u2022 During the 10th-15th day of illness, high viral loads are independent predictors of poor clinical outcome s General Characteristics \u2022 Enteroviruses represent one of the most common human viruses, affecting an estimate 50 million individual s in the United States and potentially I billion world wide.

Human viruse s are divided among five species based on molecular data into: poliovirus, HEV-A, HEV-b, HEV-C, and HEV-D \u2022 Although enteroviruses undergo rapid replication in the gastrointestinal tract they rarely cause significant gastrointestinal disease. Instead, they travel via the blood stream to target organs where they further replicate and induce pathologic alteration Clinical Presentation \u2022 Most infections are sub-clinical, although may cause a variety of acute and chronic diseases -Acute: mild upper respiratory illness (common cold), febrile rash (hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina), aseptic meningitis, pleurodynia, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and neonatal sepsis-like disease -Chronic : myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, type I diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular disease Diagnostic Methods Specimens \u2022 Nasal/throat swabs , BAL, serum, plasma, CSF, and feces samples transported in viral transport media, were either transported directly to the laboratory or were stored at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 24 Conventional Tests and Problems \u2022 Viral culture -Gold standard to detect enterovirus -Time-consuming methods and insensitive methods, relying on the presence of viable virus -Inability to fully characterize some enterovirus strains associated with late inadequate collection, handling and processing of samples, or because of intrinsic insensitivity to cell lines used \u2022 Serology -Serotype is usually irrelevant to individual management -The absence of a widely shared antigen has hampered thedevelopment of immunoassays for the enterovirus -Reports of monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with multiple enterovirus serotypes are promising, but further testing is required to determine the clinical relevance of those observations", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF29": {"text": "Pitfalls\u2022 Parechoviruses may cause similar clinical illnes ses, but are not detected by enterovirus testing \u2022 Poor handling of CSF or CSF colle cted during late infection can yield false-negative results \u2022 Enteroviruses can be shed in high titers in stool for prolonged periods.
