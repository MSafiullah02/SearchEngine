            "text": "The intestinal microbiota is defined as the collection of all living microbes (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses) residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Until a decade ago, bacterial culture was the most commonly used technique to describe bacteria within the mammalian and avian GI tract. The recent advance of molecular tools, especially next-generation sequencing technologies that allow to inexpensively amplify, sequence, and thereby identify which bacterial taxa are present in a sample, has revolutionized understanding and revealed that the GI microbiota of mammals and birds is much more species-rich than previously thought.1 In mammals, it is estimated that 100 trillion bacterial cells populate the GI tract and the total sum of bacteria is approximately 10 times more than the number of host cells. The collective genome of all these microbes (referred to as microbiome) exists in close relationship with the host and, through its immunologic and metabolic function, this highly complex microbial-host ecosystem has a crucial impact on host health, including the nervous system. Resident bacteria provide many beneficial mechanisms, such as fending off transient enteropathogens, aiding in nutrition and harvesting energy from diet, providing metabolites that feed enterocytes, and stimulating the host immune system. Although most data about the functions of the intestinal microbiota are derived from studies in mammals and fewer data are available in avian species, it is likely that many microbiota\u2013host interactions are evolutionary and conserved across various animal species. For example, in mammals, complex fibers obtained through the diet (eg, starch, cellulose, pectin) are fermented by intestinal bacteria. The end products of this bacterial fermentation are short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These are partially absorbed and serve as an energy source for the host (eg, propionate, acetate), regulate intestinal motility, and are also used as important growth factors for the intestinal epithelial cells. SCFA are also important stimuli for maintaining intestinal barrier function, thereby minimizing bacterial translocation.2, 3 SCFA are also immunomodulatory by activing regulatory T cells in the intestine.4 Although SCFA are the most studied bacterially derived metabolites, novel metabolomics approaches have revealed various other metabolites that are produced by intestinal microbiota, such as indole, a byproduct of tryptophan degradation, which is anti-inflammatory and enhances intestinal barrier function.5 Of importance is that bacterial metabolism and immunologic stimulation in the intestine have consequences that reach far beyond the GI tract. It is now well-recognized that a gut-brain connection exists that is modulated by gut microbes. Modulation of gut microbiota is an exciting emerging area of research with the potential for better understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of various intestinal and metabolic, as well as neurologic diseases.",

Bacterial culture is a useful tool for determination of an active infection of known pathogens (eg, Salmonella, Campylobacter) and antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical specimens. Individual isolates and their virulence factors can be typed for epidemiologic surveys of specific strains. It is now well-recognized that there are several limitations associated with bacterial culture of intestinal samples. Bacterial culture widely underestimates the total bacterial numbers in the intestines. Most gut bacteria cannot be isolated on routinely used laboratory media because not enough information is available about their optimal growth requirements. Most microbes in the gut are strict facultative anaerobes, hindering their successful isolation in vitro. It is estimated that less than 10% of intestinal bacteria can be cultured on routine media and only a small fraction can be correctly classified using classic morphologic and biochemical criteria. Therefore, clinical examination of intestinal samples by culture is currently biased toward the minor cultivable portion of the gut microbiota.",

The principle is that DNA is extracted from intestinal samples and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are amplified using universal bacterial primers. This approach allows in theory amplification of DNA from all known and unknown bacterial species present in a sample. To identify the phylotypes present in the sample, the PCR amplicons can be subsequently sequenced by high-throughput sequencing platforms.6 These platforms allow for analysis of several thousand sequences within a few hours, yielding a deep identification of the intestinal microbiota. If the sequence for a particular phylotype is known, specific PCR assays can be designed for its detection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (with universal-specific, group-specific, or species-specific primers) can be used for quantitative analysis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) allows visualization of the location of bacteria with regard to the epithelium (ie, intracellular, adherent, or invasive).7\n",

Some of these studies observed many yet uncharacterized bacterial sequences in the rabbit\u2019s large intestine, suggesting that rabbits have a more unique microbial ecosystem compared with other animal species. Given the emerging importance of the gut microbiota for host health, there is need for more comprehensive descriptive studies cataloging the intestinal microbiota and their functional capacity in exotic animals.

One study described the cecal microbiota of hamsters and found that Firmicutes, especially Clostridiales (families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were most abundant.19 Of interest is that fasting, but not hibernation, led to significant changes in gut microbiota, especially increases in the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila.19 It has also been recently shown in dogs that prolonged fasting has a very strong impact on the small intestinal microbiota.20 These initial studies describing the intestinal microbiota of small mammals suggest that the microbiota is as complex as in larger mammals, warranting more in-depth studies evaluating the intestinal microbiota across various diseases, and before and after nutritional interventions.",

Similarly, very little information is available about the differences in microbiota composition along the intestinal tract and luminal versus mucosal-adherent bacterial populations. In one of the first molecular-based studies, the cloacal microbiota of 16 parrots (mealy Amazon parrot and macaws) was analyzed: 8 parrots were free-ranging in southeastern Peru and 8 parrots were living in captivity in a colony in Texas.21 In this initial small-scale study, there was a trend for clustering of the captive birds versus the wild birds and, in the captive birds, based on the species and/or aviary they came from. Four predominant phyla were present across these cloacal samples in descending order of abundance: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. On lower phylogenetic levels, the bacterial families Lactobacillaceae and Staphylococcaceae were predominant. In a recently reported large-scale study, the fecal microbiota of 3 different avian species (budgerigars, cockatiels, and domestic canaries) was analyzed by next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.22 Firmicutes were the most abundant bacterial phylum, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Lactobacillus spp was the most abundant genus across all birds. Of interest was that the microbiota composition tended to be more similar for each bird species, suggesting that birds within an avian species have more similar microbiota compared with birds of other avian species.22 Similarly, a recent study described the fecal microbiota of captive cockatiels, and reported that Firmicutes were most abundant, comprising mostly Erysipelotrichaceae, Clostridium and Lactobacillus spp, respectively.23 These studies suggest that avian species have, in part, a different microbiota compared with mammals because they appear to have relative higher abundances of Lactobacillus spp.",

In a study (Rossi and colleagues, unpublished data, 2014) from the author\u2019s laboratory, initial data suggest that crop and cloaca harbor similar species richness but very distinct microbial communities (ie, different makeup of bacterial taxa). Proteobacteria were significantly more abundant in the crop compared with the cloaca, whereas Firmicutes (mostly Lactobacillus spp) and Actinobacteria were more abundant in the cloaca. This distribution is similar, at least in part, to that described in mammals, in which aerobic bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, are more abundant in more proximal parts of the GI tract, and Firmicutes are more abundant more distally.8 The reader is referred to other review articles that provide an overview about microbiota composition across other bird species.24, 25, 26\n",

Just as with the appreciation of the close relationship between intestinal microbiota and the host, the investigators realized that gut microbiota composition also influences organ systems beyond the GI tract, and is associated with changes in cognition, behavior, stress, and other disorders of the nervous system.27, 28 One potential pathway is the direct immunologic stimulation through cell-to-cell contact affecting the enteric nervous or immune system that then further provides stimulatory signals to the brain. Another potential pathway is the production of endocrine metabolites by the intestinal microbiota that, in turn, stimulate the nervous system. Although those stimuli are physiologic and beneficial, negative effects can occur when there are imbalances in commensal microbiota because they may occur through external triggers (eg, use of antibiotics), through nutritional imbalances, and also through intestinal inflammation, which, in turn, affects microbiota composition. Examples from the literature across different animal models are summarized here to provide a broad overview about the current knowledge in the field.",

These neuroendocrine substances were detected in the normal mice at regular concentrations but at much lower concentrations in the germfree mice, suggesting that the intestinal microbiota produces significant amounts of these neuroendocrine substances.30 On the other side, neuroendocrine substances produced by the host during periods of stress may modulate the virulence of enteropathogens in vivo, providing evidence how host neuroendocrine substances have also an effect on gut microbiota.31\n",

As observed in humans with multiple sclerosis, Prevotellaceae were significantly less abundant in dogs with MUO, providing additional evidence that presence of Prevotellaceae at higher abundances are associated with reduced risk for developing immune-mediated brain disease.36\n",
