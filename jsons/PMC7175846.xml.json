At least 5% of those infected have become critically ill, developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated by acute kidney injury and multi-organ failure5\n,\n6. Many of these patients require central venous access for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Obtaining access, however, can be complicated by the prone positioning that often employed for the management of severe ARDS. Here we present a case such as this and propose a novel solution to this complex access scenario.",

If the internal jugular veins are not available, our second and third choices for access are the common femoral veins and subclavian veins, respectively. This patient, like many others with severe ARDS from COVID-19, presented a number of barriers to obtaining access for RRT in the acute setting. First, prone positioning eliminates access to the common femoral veins and subclavian veins and makes obtaining internal jugular venous access significantly more challenging, elevating the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Secondly, the close proximity of the internal jugular veins to the patient\u2019s airway jeopardizes the dialysis nurses and ancillary staff by increasing their exposure to airway secretions and aerosolized particles, resulting in a heightened risk of viral transmission. Finally, many patients with COVID-19 have required prolonged treatment in the ICU setting, worsening the development of long-term central venous stenosis with internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheters.",

Under ultrasound guidance (Figures 1\na &b), the left popliteal vein was accessed in the popliteal fossa using a micro-puncture technique. We prefer examining the popliteal vein in both cross-sectional and longitudinal access so may avoid any valve and taking care not to injure the tibial nerve which is located superficially neither popliteal artery which is the deepest structure in the popliteal Fossa. A 4 Fr micropuncture sheath was placed, and a stiff .035 wire was advanced without resistance. A skin nick was made over the wire, the vein was dilated. (Figures 2\na, b &c) The 50 cm dialysis catheter (Figure 3\n) was fully advanced. The catheter was then sutured in place, and both ports were flushed easily. At this point, CRRT was immediately initiated without difficulty. The patient ultimately recovered and was transferred out of the ICU several days later.",

First, the popliteal vein is easily accessible in patient requiring prone positioning in the setting of severe ARDS, while the internal jugular, femoral, and subclavian veins are not. Secondly, using the popliteal vein for access physically distances medical personnel from the patient\u2019s upper airway, reducing transmission of the virus. Finally, using lower extremity access for RRT limits the development of catheter-induced SVC and upper extremity central venous stenosis, which are known to cause long-term AV access failure.",

            "text": "There may be disadvantages to using popliteal venous access for RRT, as well. First, this method of access is highly operator dependent, requiring familiarity with the anatomy of the popliteal fossa and comfort using ultrasound. Secondly, there is a risk of provoking lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with this method, although the risk is presumably similar to that of developing upper extremity or internal jugular catheter-associated DVT. Finally, this method requires the use of a longer dialysis catheter in order to reach the deep central veins, which may limit high flow rates during RRT. In our limited experience, however, we have not found these problems to be significant.",

We achieved access via a 50 cm dialysis catheter placed in the left popliteal vein. To our knowledge, this technique has not been previously described in the vascular surgical literature. This unorthodox choice of access was beneficial to both the patient and the staff members involved in his care. He ultimately recovered his renal function and was discharged without the need for long-term dialysis access. We propose that the popliteal veins can and should be considered for access in all critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring prone positioning and RRT. Patient\u2019s consent to publish this case report along with the technique and pictures was obtained prior to submission.",
