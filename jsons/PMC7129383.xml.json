Major classes of PRR include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLR), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic-acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) and a growing list of cytosolic DNA-sensing receptors [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Upon engagement, these receptors recruit a number of adaptor proteins to signal downstream and activate three major pathways: the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) pathway [8], [9]. Downstream TLRs and RLRs, type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines are mainly produced, while NLRs predominantly activate inflammasomes, resulting in the release of IL-1 and multiple inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1\n).",

The IFN-\u03b3, the only Type II IFN, is released by activated T and NK cells; type III IFNs, which include IFN-\u03bb 1\u20134, similarly to IFN-I are believed to regulate the antiviral response [13]. According to the most common view, IFN-I exerts primarily an anti-viral action while IFN-II acts predominantly on macrophages to induce a microbicidal state against ingested intracellular, non-viral pathogens.",

Secreted IFN-I, indeed, binds to a common heterodimeric ubiquitously expressed receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains, and initiates a signaling cascade that has been characterized in detail and reviewed elsewhere [10], [11], [12]. Briefly, canonical IFN-I pathway results in activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) family (cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases) that, in turn, activate by phosphorylation the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) [15]. Activated STATs complex with IRF9 to form the heterocomplex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), that translocates in the nucleus, binds to upstream sequence elements named IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), and activates the transcription of ISGs (Fig. 2\n). These genes act to promote viral clearance and establish an antiviral state in uninfected bystander cells, or to induce apoptosis and several anti-microbial mechanisms in infected cells. They also stimulate cells at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that trigger the adaptive response [16], [17].",

The route and tropism of bacterial infection, viral co-infections and last, but not least, the balance between IFN-I and IFN-II effects are all determinants of the different outcome [18]. The ratio between IFN-I and II species produced in response to infection, might differ as consequence of the capacity of the pathogen to stimulate specific cell types in the infected tissues. Moreover, taking into consideration that several antibacterial IFN-II-induced genes are stimulated to a much lesser degree by IFN-I, it is quite difficult in vivo to separate the activities strictly dependent on one of the two IFN families. A more reliable view consists of a crosstalk between the two pathways: if the bacterium is able to stimulate IFN-I production, generally it occurs early after the infection as an immediate innate immune response, while IFN-II intervenes later on when immune cells (such as T cell subsets and NK cells) are activated. Also due to this complex picture, while a number of viral evasion strategies have been mechanistically defined so far, studies aimed at characterizing the bacterial components that inhibit the IFN system are only recently starting to be elucidated in molecular details [19], [20], [21].",

All TLRs contain an intracellular domain, the Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR), which recruits one or more TIR-containing adaptor proteins to transmit signals downstream. TLR3 signals through the adaptor TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) to activate the two related kinases, inhibitor of kB kinase (IKK)-\u025b and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) that mediates activation by phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7.

RIG-I preferentially senses short dsRNA and ssRNA with a 5\u2032-triphosphate (5\u2032-ppp RNA), while MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA and poly I:C [30], [31], [32]. Like viral RNAs, bacterial RNAs can possess 5\u2032-ppp termini and secondary structures that make them RIG-I agonists. Consistent with this notion, RIG-I can act as a sensor of bacterial RNA and may help maintain homeostasis to gut microbiota [33], [34].  Upon recognition of non-self RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 are recruited to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also known as CARDIF, VISA or IPS1), which triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of IKK-\u025b and TBK1 and, in turn, IRF3/7 phosphorylation [35]. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING), initially identified as a cytosolic DNA sensor, also participates in the RIG-I signalling [36]. STING interacts with the adaptor MAVS at the mitochondrial associated membranes (MAM) facilitating the recruitment of TBK1 and the activation of IRF3 [37]. A more general role of STING in innate immune responses, not only limited to its function as adaptor of RNA and DNA sensors, has been now established [38].",

However, as first line of hiding from recognition, CoV encode several highly conserved nonstructural proteins (nsps) implicated in viral RNA capping activity in order to mimick N7- and 2\u2032-O-methylated 5\u2032 cap structure of cellular mRNAs [52]. These viral proteins include a RNA-triphosphatase, a guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase encoded by nsp13, 14 and 16, respectively [50], [53]. Consistently, human and mouse CoV mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induce higher expression of IFN-I and are highly sensitive to IFN-I effects [54], [55]. SARS-CoV nsp14 also encode a 3\u2032,5\u2032 exoribonuclease that is involved in RNA-proofreading, but probably it also functions in degrading viral PAMPs, further hiding immune detection [50], [56]. Similarly, nsp11 encodes a ribonuclease that may degrade viral PAMPs [57].",

            "text": "Another strategy used to avoid detection is the replication in protected sites as the double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that the virus induces in the host cytoplasm. In the case of SARS-CoV these membranes contain the replicase complex and the viral genomic RNA suggesting that replication occurs in these sites and the generated nucleic acids are soon after shielded [58], [59]. In addition, the highly basic nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV has been reported to directly inhibit IFN-I production induced by both poly(I:C) or Sendai virus, by a mechanism that involves steps upstream RIG-I. Thus, it is conceivable that by binding dsRNA, N protein prevents RIG-I/MDA5 activation [60]. Others SARS-CoV-encoded proteins, as ORF-3b and ORF6, may also interfere with the RLR recruitment of the adaptor MAVS based on their preferential localization at the mitochondrial membrane even if their mechanism of action is not yet elucidated [61], [62]. The SARS-CoV Membrane (M) protein blocks transcription of IFN-I when stimulated by dsRNA or members of the RIG-I signaling pathway including RIG-I, MAVS, IKK-\u025b, and TBK1, but it does not influence the transcriptional activity of the IFN promoter when IRF3 or IRF7 are overexpressed. The physical association of SARS-CoV M with RIG-I, TBK1, IKK-\u025b, and TRAF3 suggests that M protein may prevent the formation of the functional complex with TBK1 thereby inhibiting activation of IRF3/IRF7 and IFN-I transcription [63]. Similarly, the papain-like protease (PLP) domain contained in the SARS-CoV nsp3 protein, an essential component of the viral replicase complex, interacts with the adaptor STING blocking the binding to MAVS and the recruitment of the TBK1/IRF3 complex [64], [65], [66]. Finally, through its deubiquitinating activity, the PLP protein removes Ubiquitin from several components of the RLR pathway blocking their activation (reviewed in [50], [51], [67], [68]).",

So, ORF-4a inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 pathway without a direct binding to the sensor, but by perturbing the function of a stimulator of RIG-I signaling as PACT [70].

Moreover, to hide their nucleic acids during the replicative cycle, both DENV and WNV induce the formation of convoluted membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus that envelop the virus replication complex [82], [83] protecting viral nucleic acids from both TLR and RLR recognition, as it occurs along the infection with CoV.  So far, an antagonism at the level of sensing signaling has been clearly defined only for DENV that fails to induce an IFN response in myeloid cells where it replicates, despite other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced [84], [85]. The ability to inhibit IFN-I production is due to the viral NS2B/3 protease that binds and cleaves the adaptor/sensor STING [85], [86], [87]. Interestingly, first evidences indicate that the NS2B/3 proteases of other Flaviviruses, as JEV or YFV, are not able to cleave STING, while the NS4B of YFV can do it [68].",

            "text": "To the same Flaviviridae family belongs the Hepacivirus genus, distantly related to Flaviviruses, that includes Hepatitis C virus (HCV) a major cause of chronic liver disease [88], [89]. HCV uses several strategies to efficiently evade innate immunity and this escape is considered the main determinant of viral persistence that leads to a chronic infection in 70\u201380% of infected people [88], [90]. HCV RNA can be sensed by different PRRs, namely RLRs, TLRs, NLRs, and, as recently reported, by protein kinase R (PKR). RIG-I is the best described sensor for the poly U/UC region located within the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the viral RNA, along with a 5\u2032-ppp. This region is essential for viral replication and, thus, highly conserved among HCV genotypes.  The key viral protein involved in the evasion strategies is the NS3/4A protease, which consists of NS3 and NS4A. The complex is essential for several steps in the viral cycle including viral RNA replication, polyprotein processing and viral assembly [91]. Taking advantage of its serine protease activity, NS3/4A cleaves the adaptor MAVS, preventing its dimerization and downstream signaling [92], [93]. After cleavage, MAVS dissociates from the mitochondrial associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) where upon HCV-induced RIG-I activation it is recruited and colocalizes with IKK-\u025b [94], thus impairing IFN-I expression [95]. Importantly, the cleavage of MAVS by the viral protease has been confirmed in patients [96].  To antagonize IFN-I production, NS4B protein instead targets STING. HCV NS4B, indeed, contains a STING homology domain and interacts with STING in the ER blocking STING interaction with MAVS and TBK1 [97], [98]. Even if the exact molecular mechanism involved in NS4B inhibition of STING signaling has not yet been defined in the context of viral infection, NS4B likely cooperates with NS3/4A in targeting the RIG-I signaling pathway. Interestingly, NS2B/3 and NS4B of other members of the Flaviviridae family including DENV and YFV as mentioned above also block STING signaling and possess the same STING homology domain, indicating a conserved mechanism of STING antagonisms between flaviviruses and hepaciviruses.",

As reported above for the MAVS adaptor, the serine protease NS3/4A also cleaves the key adaptor of TLR3, TRIF [99], thus preventing an IFN response in productively-infected hepatocytes. In these cells, the HCV-induced miR-21 has been recently reported to be involved in evasion of IFN-I production and stimulation of HCV replication, upon suppression of MyD88 and IRAK1 expression, that is required for the TLR7-mediated sensing of the virus [100]. In macrophages, MyD88 signaling is instead targeted by the NS5A protein that, upon the direct binding to the adaptor, impairs the recruitment of IRAK-1 and cytokine production in response to TLR ligands [101]. Interestingly, TLR3 and TLR7 levels are decreased in patients chronically infected with HCV [102], [103] and this has been recently correlated with increased levels of miR-758 [104].",

PKR, upon binding HCV RNA and independently of its kinase-activity, interacts with MAVS to induce the transcription of a number of early ISGs including IFN stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), but not IFN-I. ISG15, in turn, deubiquitinates RIG-I inhibiting its functions [110]. By doing so, HCV blocks sensing by PKR and reinforces HCV evasion from RIG-1 signaling.",

In spite of evidence that a sustained IFN-I response occurs in HIV-infected patients, it fails to clear the infection in the first place and to prevent the early establishment of long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs [111], [112], [113]. HIV-1 has, indeed, developed a number of strategies to block the IFN signaling and the activity of IFN-induced host restriction factors. Here, we only briefly summarize these strategies some of which have been only recently discovered, leading to the identification of immune pathways, thus far, unrecognized (as recently reviewed elsewhere [114], [115], [116], [117], [118], [119], [120]).",

            "text": "With the exception of pDCs, which produce high levels of IFN-I upon detection of HIV-1 ssRNA by TLR7, in all other immune cells IFN-I production is prevented or barely detectable unless viral countermeasures are disabled. In conventional DCs (cDCs), monocytes and resting CD4+ T cells, indeed, HIV-1 sensing is prevented by the restriction factor Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) and the hystidine/aspartic acid (HD) domain-containing protein1 (SAMHD1) that blocks reverse transcription or directly degrades genomic RNA, thus preventing PRR recognition [122], [123]. This SAMHD1-mediated restriction is overcome by the viral protein Vpx [124], [125] that is a HIV-2 and SIV accessory protein absent in HIV-1. This apparent disadvantage is, however, effectively exploited by the virus that maintains a reward by not replicating in myeloid cells and by reducing the impact of IFN-I production in these cells. The block of productive infection in non-cycling cells where SAMDH1 is active, particularly in cDCs, results in lack of maturation and thus in impairment in priming of naive, HIV-1-specific T cells for optimal anti-HIV-1 immunity [126]. Furthermore, in the small fraction of cDCs that become infected, the recognition of HIV-1 genomic RNA by TLR8 paradoxically licenses HIV-1 transcription [127]. In this case, productive DC infection allows an increased transmission to T cells while inhibiting IFN-I production. In monocytes instead, recognition of viral RNA by TLR8, does not trigger IFN-I production but, as in the case of HCV, leads to the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome with activation of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 production, favoring the establishment of an inflammatory milieu that fuels HIV-1 replication [108], [126]. In contrast, in cells that are target of a productive infection, such as macrophages and T lymphocytes, IFN-I production is prevented by an escape mechanism mediated by the HIV-1 protease that drives RIG-I to the lysosomes [128].",

Finally, resting CD4+ T cells are not permissive to virus replication due to the expression of an active SAMHD1 that, as mentioned before, degrades genomic RNA and prevents efficient RT and recognition of ssDNA. However, this prevention of sensing may not be complete and partial recognition of RT intermediates by the IFI16 sensor not only leads to the initiation of IFN-I production, but also to the activation of the inflammasome, triggering cell death mechanisms including pyroptosis and apoptosis [131]. Finally, the viral capsid exploits two cellular proteins, cyclophilin A and CPSF6, and binds just a right amount of both to allow opening of the capsid and RT process, while preventing sensing of the viral cDNA before integration with the following production of IFN-I [132], [133].",

Several immunoevasion strategies that result in total impairment of the innate immune system are responsible for most of EBOV virulence [135]. A major target of these strategies that are exerted by few viral proteins, is the IFN-I response that controls in vivo filoviruses infection [136]. At the level of viral sensing, the EBOV VP35 inhibits RIG-I signaling [137], [138]. VP35 binds with high affinity to dsRNA and 5\u2032-ppp dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner. Four crystallographic structures of EBOV VP35 RBD/IID from Zaire and Reston viruses and of MARV VP35 RBD/IID have elucidated how VP35 RBD/IID dimers bind to RNA strands and how the dimers mimic the RLR shape, hiding the RNA recognition site [139], [140]. Interestingly, the residues involved in both protein\u2013protein interactions at the RBD/IID dimer interface and involved in dsRNA binding are highly conserved among all known EBOV and MARV species.

LPS, an ubiquitous component of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, is a PAMP that is recognized by the TLR4/MD-2 complex present on the cell surface. Some bacterial species have evolved an alternative form of LPS resulting in a weak antagonist of TLR4/MD-2 signaling. This strategy is utilized by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of pestis infection. The acylation status of lipid A from hexa- to tetra-acylated is reduced when the temperature increases from 21 \u00b0C (flea temperature) to 37 \u00b0C (human temperature). This alteration renders lipid A less recognizable LPS by TLR4 and, following transmission from fleas to humans, contributes predominantly to the virulence of the bacterium [142]. Another example is Shigella that, after internalization and proliferation within epithelial cells, hypoacylates lipid A to become less visible to the immune system once leave the infected epithelial cells [143].",

As a deubiquitinating protease, YopJ prevents or removes the K63-polymerized ubiquitin conjugates, which are required for TRAF3 and TRAF6 activation in the signal transduction pathway leading to IRF3 activation [144].

In addition to the role played in the attachment to the host membrane, this factor shares sequence similarities with conserved regions present in the cytoplasmic tails of inhibitory receptors of the host immune system, such as the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Tir utilizes these ITIM-like motifs to mimic an endogenous innate immunoregulatory mechanism. In particular, Tir recruits the host Src-homology-region-2-domain-containing phosphatase 1 to the adaptor TRAF6 and thus prevents polyubiquitinylation and activation of TRAF6 in the IFN-stimulated pathway [146].",

IFN-I production downstream of these signaling pathways depends essentially on the presence and activation of IRFs and their contribution changes depending on the cell type considered [9]. The IRF family is presently composed of nine mammalian members namely IRF1 to 9, coded by distinct but related genes that exert a number of functions in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The IRFs with intrinsic antiviral function include IRF3 and IRF7 that are essential for the PRR-mediated IFN gene transcription, but also induce some IFN effectors in an IFN-independent manner. IRF9, as mentioned before, is part of the heterocomplex ISGF3 that drives the expression of most ISGs including IRF1 (Fig. 2). Although IRF1 is itself an ISGs, which affects different aspects of the immune response even independently from IFN-I production [149], [150], it also represents a positive regulator of IFN-I gene expression in response to specific stimuli in a cell type specific manner [151]. Moreover, IRF1 plays a crucial role in regulating MAVS-dependent signaling from peroxisomes [152]. In this respect, IRF1 regulates the transcriptional profile of antiviral genes unique to that induced by IFN-I and cooperatively promotes an effective antiviral program against a broad spectrum of viruses [152], [153]. IRF5 is instead specifically involved in inflammatory cytokines induction [9]. Given the unique functions exerted by IRFs, viruses have evolved strategies aimed at the specific destruction of these transcription factors. With regard to the viruses covered here, most of them inhibit IRF activation either indirectly by acting on sensors and elements of the signaling pathway that activate them, as described above, or directly by impairing/hijacking IRF activity (Fig. 3).",

As SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV PLP is a viral deubiquitinating enzyme that acts on both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination and ISG15-linked ISGylation, two posttranslational modifications that play important roles in regulating the RIG-I and STING/IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activation [156].

            "text": "Several HCV proteins interfere with IRF activity. The HCV NS3 protease impairs IRF3 activation by blocking the interaction with TBK1 and IRF3 [162]. In addition, the NS2 protein inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, IKK-\u025b- and especially TBK1-induced IRF3 phosphorylation [163].  The basic amino acid region 1 (BR1) in the N-terminal region of the core protein is also crucial in inhibiting IRF3 dimerization as well as phosphorylation induced by NDV infection and poly (I:C) [164]. Interestingly, this domain has been identified as the binding region for a DEAD box protein the DDX3, which has been recently found to enhance the TBK1/IKK-\u025b-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity upon binding to the adaptor MAVS [165]. The HCV core also decreased the expression levels of DDX3 suggesting that the IRF3 inhibition may be mediated by the core effect on DDX3. Moreover, through binding to DDX3, the HCV core protein also promotes HCV replication. Thus, the core protein appears to switch DDX3 from an IFN-inducing mode to an HCV-replication mode [166]. IRF1 expression is, instead, suppressed by the HCV core at the transcriptional level. This event blocks the expression of several antiviral and immunomodulatory genes of both innate and adaptive immunity and, in doing so, facilitates the establishment of HCV persistent infection [167]. In line with this hypothesis, accumulating evidence suggests that HCV also targets DCs to control the host antiviral response and trigger persistence. As WNV NS1, HCV core is, indeed, a secreted protein found in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic infection that may thus affect directly DC functions. In this context, it has been recently reported that the core protein suppresses IFN-I production in response to TLR agonists and to RIG-I stimulated by HCV PAMP in a cell culture model of pDCs, through the reduced levels of IRF7 and of phosphorylated STAT1 protein [168]. The effect on IRF7 is, however, not direct but probably mediated by the reduced levels of IFN-I production by core-stimulated pDCs. Whether or not this also occurs along the natural infection and contributes to HCV persistency remains to be determined.",

IRF1 activity is, however, exploited by the virus to induce a distinct subset of ISGs that despite displays intrinsic and unique antiviral actions, does not restrict viral infection [175]. IRF1 is also induced in HIV-1-productively infected T cells where it may regulate viral promoter activity even in the absence of the viral transactivator Tat driving initial transcription of the viral genome [176], [177]. Later on, however, when viral replication is mostly accomplished by the viral transactivator, IRF1 is sequestered by Tat to accelerate proteasomal-mediated IRF1 degradation (Remoli AL and Battistini A, unpublished) and to quench IRF1 transcriptional activity on target genes [178]. By so doing, Tat disarms the unique antiviral response against viral infections that IRF1 could exert [153]. A block of IFN transcription in primary CD4+ T cells may also depend on CD3/CD28-mediated activation of IKK-\u025b. We, indeed, recently reported that IKK-\u025b activation results in a peculiar pattern of IRF phosphorylation in T cells, including a splicing isoform of IRF3, which may function as an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b2 expression, and phosphorylation of IRF1 that blocks its activity on IFN-I promoter [179].",

Indeed, VP35 interacts with the TBK-1/IKK-\u025b kinase domain and functions as a substitute substrate, thus inhibiting both the kinase activity and the binding of the physiological IRF3/7 substrate [180], [181]. Notably, mutations of VP35 residues, involved in this IFN antagonism, do not alter the function of VP35 in viral replication and transcription [182].  In DCs, VP35 targets IRF7. By interacting with the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 ligase PIAS1, VP35 promotes IRF7 sumoylation, a post-translational modification that prevents IRF translocation into the nucleus and, in turn, IFN-I gene transcription. A similar effect of VP35 was also reported for IRF3 [183]. This VP35 activity is independent of its ability to recognize dsRNA and maps to the N-terminus, which is essential for interactions with both IRF7 and PIAS1. Interestingly, SUMO modification of IRF3/7 is a part of the negative feedback loop of normal IFN-I signaling [184] that is exploited by EBOV to weaken host innate immunity.",

The ORF6-encoded protein, instead, antagonizes STAT1 function by interacting and sequestering in the ER components of the nuclear import complex, as karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1. By doing so, ORF-6 competes for the binding of the nuclear import complex to STAT1, thus inhibiting STAT1 nuclear import [188].

This pathway is physiologically induced by different stimuli, including the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER [189], [190] that, as mentioned before, represents the site of Flaviviruses replication. Activation of the UPR pathway inhibits IFN activation and induces a general ER stress response, thus facilitating viral replication. The methyltransferase domain of NS5 from Langat virus and JEV, instead, binds directly to IFNAR through its methyltransferase domain and inhibits the activation of kinases associated to the receptor [191], [192].  Several WNV non structural proteins, as NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, have been reported to prevent the phoshorylation of JAK1, TYK2 and, as a consequence, the activation of STAT1/2 (recently reviewed in [73]). Likewise, expression of DENV nonstructural protein NS2A, NS4A, or NS4B proteins impairs the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by reducing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 [193]. Phosphorylation of STAT2 is also blocked by DENV NS5 through inhibition of Jak1 and Tyk2 activity [194]. NS5 also binds to the coiled-coil region in the first half of the human STAT2 protein and acts as a bridge between UBR-4, a member of the N-recognin family, and STAT2 leading to STAT2 ubiquitination and proteasomal-mediated degradation [195], [196]. Interestingly, only proteolytically-processed NS5 can efficiently mediate STAT2 degradation, though both unprocessed and processed NS5 proteins are able to bind STAT2.",

The crystal structure of human KPNalpha5 C terminus in complex with VP24 has been recently resolved and a unique nonclassical nuclear localization signal binding site on KPNA5 has been identified. This motif is necessary for binding and efficient nuclear import of tyrosine-phosphorylated-STAT1 [210].  EBOV VP24 can also directly bind STAT1; whether the binding occurs with the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated STAT1 or both isoforms it is not yet clear [211]. However, also unphosphorylated STAT1 enters the nucleus to activate and sustain the expression of a number of IFN-induced immune regulatory genes, which are distinct from those activated by the phosphorylated STAT1. Thus, EBOV VP24 binding and inhibition of either forms of STAT1 may be important in the suppression of an antiviral state.",

This is consistent with the observation that regions important for karyopherin alpha binding are different between these two VP24s [210].  In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT is inhibited by the MARV matrix protein VP40 that also inhibits this IFN-II signaling. Interestingly, also JAK1-dependent and IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 are targeted by MARV VP40 suggesting that MARV may globally inhibit JAK1-dependent cytokine signaling with mechanisms different from that employed by EBOV [212].",

Having found that influenza viruses replicate to a higher efficiency in cells co-infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Warnking et al. [213] demonstrated that an impaired STAT1/STAT2 dimerization is responsible for a poor induction of ISG transcription in spite of an abundant secretion of IFN-I driven by the FLU virus infection. Similarly, the inhibition of the response to IFN-I by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed in human macrophages and correlated with mycobacterial pathogenicity [214]. In primary cells and THP-1 cells, indeed, Mycobacterium tuberculosis specifically inhibits IFN-I signal transduction pathway by impairing the activation of STAT1, while the avirulent Mycobacterium bovis BCG fails to do so. Alteration in ISGF-3 complex formation was instead observed in human macrophages infected with nonpathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG where only STAT1 homodimers were found. In contrast, the pathogenic Streptococcus pyogenes led to formation of not only STAT1 homodimers but also of ISGF-3 [215]. Based on these finding the authors speculated that the efficient induction of IFN-I production and related transcription factor activation by streptococci would lead to fast and effective immune responses that, however, could play a role in the pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Amongst viruses covered in this review, both antiviral and proviral roles of PKR have been reported for HCV. The HCV NS5A and E2 proteins directly interfere with the antiviral action of PKR. NS5A binds directly to PKR, while the glyco-protein E2 acts as competitive substrate with eIF2 \u03b1 for PKR binding, resulting in inhibition of PKR kinase activity and in increased HCV replication. The full length IRES of HCV RNA, which is recognized by PKR, may mediate either activation or inhibition of PKR [224]. Moreover, NS5A, by binding to various domains of the IRES, can alter the activation of PKR [225]. Another indirect inhibitory strategy mediated by the HCV IRES has been recently reported. Upon HCV RNA sensing, PKR activates the MAVS/TRAF3/IRF3 pathway that, however, does not induce IFN but a set of ISGs including ISG15. As mentioned, ISG15 deubiquitinates RIG-I to negatively control the RIG-I/MAVS pathway and prevent uncontrolled detrimental IFN-I expression in physiological conditions. Thus, HCV hijacks a protective cellular pathway to curtail host innate response [110]. Through a specific IRES-mediated inhibition of eIF2\u03b1-dependent translation, the HCV IRES also regulates the translational activity of PKR [224]. eIF2 \u03b1 is, indeed, essential to the translation of capped mRNA, as those of ISGs, while non-capped mRNAs, as those of HCV, are translated independently from this factor. A general attenuation of ISGs expression by HCV IRES can be achieved also through a direct activation of PKR [226]. Interestingly, this attenuation of ISG expression is observed in acute but not persistent infection, where, instead, a sustained ISG expression occurs [206], [227].",

In vitro, PKR is activated by low amounts of TAR RNA, whereas high concentrations inhibit the kinase function. The viral Tat protein also counteracts PKR activation by several other mechanisms: it sequesters the activating dsRNA; it can act as a substrate homologue of eIF2\u03b1 preventing the PKR mediated inhibition of protein synthesis; it prevents PKR auto-phosphorylation and exploits PKR activity to get phosphorylated and increase its binding to TAR RNA. Moreover, HIV-1 replicates only in cells that have high levels of the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), a strong inhibitor of PKR activation. Interestingly, during HIV-1 infection of lymphocytes, when HIV-1 replicates at high levels, increased amounts of ADAR1, an IFN-induced RNA editing enzyme that binds to PKR to inhibit its activation, have been observed. Moreover, PACT contributes to PKR dephosphorylation during HIV-1 replication probably due to its binding to ADAR1 [234]. Thus, HIV-1 has evolved to replicate in cells with high levels of TRBP, to induce the expression of ADAR1 and to change the function of PACT for PKR inhibition [235].",

However, by affecting this post-translational modification, both viruses may modify cellular protein localization, protein activity and stability as well as signal transduction in order to increase viral replication and severity of infection.

            "text": "Despite the well-characterized role in restricting replication of several viruses, ISG15 may actually also promote the replication of specific viruses, as HCV. In HCV infections both anti-viral or pro-viral effects exerted by ISG15 could be related to the net effect of ISGylation on the various viral and host proteins targeted by ISG15. An antiviral effect has been reported when ISG15 could conjugate to HCV NS5A, thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of IFN-I on HCV replication [245]. In contrast, several groups have reported that ISG15 and ISGylation promote HCV production in a cell culture model independently of upstream IFN signaling [246], [247]. Although counter-intuitive, this finding may be explained by the observed inhibition of IFN-I induction by HCV upon ISG15 overexpression that negatively controls the RIG-I/MAVS pathway at the level of RIG-I ubiquitination [110]. A negative regulation of IFN-I expression may also be mediated by USP18, an ISG displaying a potent inhibitory effect on the IFN-I pathway, to prevent autoinflammatory consequences of uncontrolled IFN-I production. Similarly, USP18 may dampen the detrimental role that the hyperactivation of IFN-I signaling plays in the pathogenesis of some viral and bacterial infections, including HIV-1, HCV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. USP18 is, indeed, stabilized by ISG15 in an unconjugated free form [248]. In this respect, the suggested potential role of the ISG15/USP18 pathway in HCV persistence is consistent with the observation that increased expression of hepatic ISGs before IFN treatment is associated with an absent or poor response in patients chronically infected with HCV [249]. Thus, ISG15/USP18 pathway might explain the paradox that the preactivation of the endogenous IFN system, while fails to clear the infection, instead, may stimulate HCV production and blunt the effect of exogenous IFN-I.",

The decreased survival of mice that carry a point mutation in USP18 results from higher Salmonella load in the spleen and liver, an increased inflammatory response and increased IFN-I signaling. Similarly, these USP18 mutant mice are more susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and have increased bacterial load in the lung and spleen, elevated inflammatory cytokine production and more severe lung pathology [250]. In line with these findings, the results of Dorhoi et al. [251] have shown that IFNAR1 deficient mice were protected from death upon aerogenic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover, a rather detrimental effect of IFN-I was also found in whole blood of patients with tuberculosis, where a neutrophil-driven, IFN-inducible transcriptional signature was associated with clinical severity [252], [253], [254]. These results thus reveal that some viruses and bacteria, to push replication and persistence, utilize an opposite, but as much as effectual strategy, consisting in enhancing/perpetuating an IFN-I response by targeting negative regulators of IFN-I expression.",

            "text": "Anti-microbial molecules, such as nitric oxide (NO) radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate the antibacterial properties of IFN-I. The key producers of NO is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme that can be induced by both IFN-I and -II, although the latter is the conventional inducer that plays a crucial role in fighting the infection of intracellular bacteria [255]. Similarly, IFN-I and -II induce the subunits of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which generates ROS for killing organisms [256]. Thus, pathogens have evolved several ways of avoiding ROS- and NO-mediated killing. In spite of the fact that no data are available, so far, on the strategies exploited by bacteria to contrast the IFN-mediated transcriptional regulation of iNOS and NADPH oxidase, a common theme for successful intracellular pathogens is the ability to avoid the colocalization with these harmful host enzymes. Intracellular Salmonella, which resides within a specialized membrane compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) in macrophages, uses a T3SS called Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (Spi2) to mediate protection from NO and ROS intermediates [257]. Intracellular organisms have also developed mechanisms to detoxify and repair NO-mediated damage [255], as well as to avoid the induction of iNOS activity [258].",

In parallel, with the enormous recent advances in the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of innate immune responses to pathogens, specific processes by which pathogenic microorganisms subvert these innate immune pathways, including the IFN system, is becoming progressively appreciated and it is reasonable to assume that many more will be discovered in the near future. By learning from the anti-immune strategies of pathogens we can, thus, not only identify key pathogen regulators as useful target to exploit to the host advantage, but we can also unveil weaknesses of host defenses and intervene to more precisely tune the immune response.",

IFN-I is, indeed, not always protective but can instead play a pathogenic role as reported for some bacterial and viral infections, where an uncontrolled IFN production is a determinant of disease progression. Even in these cases, however, insights in the mechanisms involved in turning an IFN protective response into a pathogenetic one, may be as well relevant for non-pathogen-induced diseases, as autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. In this context, cell death and inflammasome activation have been described as crucial IFN-I-regulated events exploited by both pathogen and host to get their own advantage. Despite inflammasome facilitates pathogen clearance and is beneficial to the host, in some instances, IFN-induced non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis appear to be detrimental due to excessive cell death, inflammation, and collateral tissue damage in vital organs [260]. So pathogen proteins themselves or modified versions of them could be used as therapeutics working in suppressing inappropriate immune activation. This would be a bright way of hijacking molecules evolved during pathogen adaptation and associated fitness, to shift the balance to the host advantage. Similarly, some identified targets of viral proteins in PRR signaling pathways might be turned out to be new targets for treating a range of diseases.",
