Because of the stable nature of most specimens (e.g., crystals and metallic films) material science type specimens were relatively easy to adapt to this new science tool. Biologists however encountered a different situation. The first published micrographs of chicken liver tumor by Dr. Ladislaus Laszlo Marton in 1934 [1] were in a word\u2014awful; the material was literally incinerated by the beam. He later published the first electron micrographs of bacteria spread on carbon films demonstrating that biological specimens could be imaged if you used an appropriate preparatory technique.",

The answer, at least in part, came with the invention of plastic support films (e.g., Formvar) developed first and presented by Schaeffer Harker in 1942 for use in X-ray crystallography and applied physics [2]. Here again was an invention that was seized upon by the biological researchers as a way to mount and prepare their own delicate specimens.",

Then in 1946 a young researcher, Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, at Ann Arbor Michigan found an unused electron microscope in the basement of the Bacteriology Laboratory and succeeded in taking beautiful pictures of the influenza virus. They were particularly appealing because of the metal shadowing technique that he had just developed, which provided three-dimensional images of the virus. With further improvements on this technique; modern and substantially better apparatus for preparing our specimens, metal shadowing has become a rapid and reliable method to produce very-high-resolution images of many types of biological specimens.",

            "text": "The shadow casting consists of evaporating a metal source at an oblique angle to the specimen. The smaller the objects being shadowed the smaller the angle must be. The effect of the oblique deposition is to deposit metal onto the relatively higher portions of the specimen, thus casting a partial or total shadow in the direction opposite the source. When the metal shadowed specimens are observed in the electron microscope, areas where the metal coating is the thickest will scatter the electron beam creating dark areas while those areas where the metal is thin will be transparent to the beam and appear bright. The images were originally view as photograph negative images where the metalized areas appeared white and the shadows (very thin areas) appeared dark [3]. It was thought that these images conformed more closely to the usual usage of the term shadow. This changed with the invention of Rotary shadowing techniques. Heinmets introduced a variant on the original technique by placing a small electric motor into the vacuum chamber and spinning the specimen during shadowing to coat surface structures with a uniform film of metal on all sides [4]. This still produced a three dimensional image but now it appeared much more vivid if it was viewed as a positive image and so like all transmission electron micrographs, these images are now viewed as positive images rather than as the photographic negative (Fig. 1).\n\n",

            "text": "While uniform deposition of metal on all sides of a particle provides greater contrast, it also can produce curious artifacts. Neugebauer and Zingsheim observed these artifacts and studied the relationship of these artifacts to the angle of shadowing, and found that it was most pronounced at low shadowing angles [5]. Particles that have a great degree of structural symmetry often appeared to have a donut-shape hole at their centers when viewed from above. A similar problem occurs when looking at filamentous structures when you are examining the \u201chandedness\u201d (i.e., right or left helical twist) as exhibited by strands of protein, DNA, or RNA. The direction of the twist can be completely obscured by the metal coating. With symmetrical particles, the problem can be even more challenging if the particles are expected to have an actual hole in their center, such as connexons of gap junctions, then this artifact becomes very apparent. In 1982, Hirokawa and Heuser confirmed that connexons of gap junctions do indeed have a central tunnel after examining the structure by employing both unidirectional and rotary-shadowing techniques at relatively high angle [6]. This study clearly demonstrated that an understanding of the structure in question is prerequisite to the correct interpretation of the images provided by the electron microscope. Further, a thorough understanding of the specimen preparation techniques plays a key role in the ultrastructural interpretation of your specimens.",

However, when imaging single molecules of proteins and macromolecules like DNA and RNA you would need a very thin continuous film on the order of 0.01\u20130.03 nm so as not to significantly enlarge or alter the fine structure of the specimen. For these applications the choice of shadowing metal is very important (see\nNote\n2).The deposited metal film must also resist recrystallization and thermal creep of evaporated metal deposit which would change the apparent specimen structure [8].\n",

            "text": "The phenomenon of metal creep after evaporation has more to do with the setup of the vacuum evaporator apparatus and the vacuum conditions than the choice metal. Although some metals are more prone to creep and puddling (e.g., pure gold) than others, in most cases the use of alloys (i.e., gold\u2013palladium or platinum\u2013palladium) and working at very high vacuum (10\u22127 Torr) will prevent thermal creep of the deposited metal film. Modern shadowing techniques utilize a variety of metals and alloys including platinum, gold, palladium, tungsten, tantalum, and europium; see the table list of metals below. Of these metals, the most popularly used for shadowing biological specimens are platinum co-evaporated with carbon or alloyed with palladium, introduced in 1959 by Bradley, and tantalum evaporated on a tungsten filament, introduced in 1962 by Bachmann and Hayek [9, 10]. These two alloys have been found to produce very fine-grain films owing to the fact that recrystallization of the film after evaporation and deposition is minimal. In the case of platinum\u2013carbon co-evaporation technique, the carbon appears to reduce the tendency of the platinum to recrystallization by improving the thermal conductivity of the biological matrix. However, tantalum belongs to the group of refractory metals; loosely defined in metallurgy and material science as a subgroup of elements (e.g., Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Re) with melting points above 2,000 \u00b0C, high hardness at room temperature, chemically inert, and relatively high densities. Their extremely high melting points and stability against creep deformation and their inability to recrystallize make these metals a good choice for high-resolution metal shadowing (see\nNote\n1).",

            "text": "Hall introduced a \u201cmica replication\u201d technique where he used freshly cleaved mica substrates, air spraying various macromolecules onto this surface followed by low-angle rotary shadowing to produce very precise metal shadowed renderings of the sample macromolecules [11]. Tyler and Branton reported a significant improvement on this technique by first mixing the macromolecules into a solution of glycerol (40\u201350 %) and ammonium acetate buffer before air spraying the sample onto freshly cleaved mica sheets [12]. This modification produced a more dispersed spreading and even distribution of the macromolecules on the mica surface. They called this new modification \u201cGlycerol drying\u201d. Specifically, they added glycerol to the sample before spraying it onto the mica and backed the metal replica with a carbon film. The addition of glycerol was first proposed as a cryoprotectant/antifreeze because in their first attempts the macromolecules were sprayed onto mica sheets that were placed onto liquid nitrogen cooled copper blocks. Glycerol spraying/low-angle rotary shadowing has been shown to preserve native conformations comparably to cryo-techniques [13]. However, the glycerol spraying technique works equally well at room temperature because glycerol is actually acting as a wetting agent to preserve the water activity at the molecular level around the molecules until they are dried in the vacuum apparatus.",

            "text": "Vacuum drying of sprayed macromolecules even in a glycerol solution does not completely avoid drying artifacts. Molecules sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces and visualized by this method are noticeably flattened and extended. However, the results obtained by this method are still far superior to those obtained by air drying alone. Fowler and Aebi [14] suggested that this artifact was due to the impact force with which the macromolecule-containing drops of glycerol hit the mica surface during spraying. The impact velocity is such that the droplets are flattened, then immediately retract, leaving a ring of macromolecules adsorbed to the mica in a thin layer of buffer solution around the central droplet. Once placed in the vacuum the very thin layer of volatile buffer dries \u201cinstantaneously,\u201d leaving what has been described as the \u201chalo\u201d around the dried center droplets of glycerol and salt residues from the buffers [14]. However, this same \u201chalo\u201d can be seen around glycerol droplets sprayed directly onto grids prepared with carbon stabilized Formvar support films, but the molecules appear less flattened and extended, even demonstrating folded-to-extended conformational changes in Myosin V molecules [15]. This suggests that the flattening effect is do, at least in part to the highly charged surface of the freshly cleaved mica substrate and not the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d drying proposed by Fowler and Aebi [14]. Since that Myosin V study (see Fig. 3) I did here at our laboratory in 2004, I have successfully used this modification on many different macromolecular preps including single strand DNA and RNA, and have had consistently good results.\n\n",

            "text": "The mica sandwich technique was introduced by A. Paul Mould et al. as an alternative to glycerol spraying to reduce the shearing forces on the macromolecules during the spray application [17]. Their sandwich method suggested that by replacing glycerol spraying by simply placing a few drops of your sample suspension in 40\u201370 % glycerol between two sheets of freshly cleaved mica, provided a better way of adsorbing macromolecular assemblies, intact onto the mica substrate. The technique is very simple and effective for larger and more shear sensitive material than conventional spraying. Placing a few drops of your suspension of macromolecules onto the freshly cleaved mica surface and then re-opposing the other sheet on top causes the suspension to be applied evenly to both surfaces by capillary action. The macromolecules are absorbed onto the mica surfaces, and the two pieces are then separated and dried in the vacuum apparatus at 10\u22126 Torr with the glycerol layer uppermost and rotary shadowed. Mould and his colleagues were able to demonstrate that macromolecular filaments of F-actin and even collagen could be spread and metal shadowed without the inevitable shortening of these long filaments observed when these same preparations were glycerol sprayed [17].",

As Cynthia Goldsmith and Sara Miller point out in their Clinical Microbiology Review [18], \u201cElectron microscopy (EM) has long been used in the discovery and description of viruses.\u201d The main advantages of using electron microscopy for viral and bacterial diagnosis is that it is very rapid and does not require organism specific reagents to recognize the pathogenic agent and very little sample is needed to produce EM specimens for analysis. As they suggested in their review, electron microscopy offers the investigator an unbiased, candid view of whatever might be present, while molecular tests require forehand knowledge of the potential infective agent.",

Next pick up the film with copper grids as one would pick up sections from the boat of a knife in ultramicrotomy (see Fig. 12). Your specimens are ready to be observed in your TEM. These are very stable sample and may be stored indefinitely in clean grid boxes.\n",

            "text": "\nWhile it is useful to know how much metal is needed to produce the desired metal shadow, it is often more empirical than calculated. There is however a fairly simple calculation based on the shadow angle and the density of the metal that you are using, that can be helpful in setting up the vacuum apparatus and producing your first metal shadowed specimens [8].\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ M=\\frac{4\\pi {r}^2 t\\rho}{ sin\\alpha} $$\n\\end{document}M=4\u03c0r2t\u03c1sin\u03b1\n\nM = the weight of the metal in grams\nr = the distance from the source to the specimen\nt = the thickness of the deposit in \u212b\n\u03c1 = the density of the metal you are using in g/cm3\n\n\u03b1 = the shadowing angleFor further information on the refractory properties of these metals the reader is referred to the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.While chromium provides very thin continuous films down to 0.03\u20130.05 nm that adhere tightly to the specimen, if not imaged and recorded immediately they will appear very granular due to the almost immediate oxidation to chromium oxide, rendering the specimens unusable for further observation and analysis.A new silicon rubber embedding mold can be used (inverted) as a grid pad if you do not have silicon rubber pad on hand. Grids will stick to this surface without slipping and the pad will stick to the table of the vacuum evaporator without the use of double sided adhesive tape.To ensure a smooth, even spread of sample and stain, the support film must be hydrophilic. A freshly carbon-coated grid will provide good spreading, but older grids may not. Methods for returning hydrophobic grids to a state where they will provide an acceptable, even spreading of your sample have been described [4]. The best way is to glow discharge them if a vacuum evaporator or a glow discharge device if one is available. If you do not have access to a glow discharge devise, an easy and surprisingly effective method is to treat the grids on a drop of 1 % aqueous Alcian blue for 5 min and then wash them on three to five drops of water until the rinse droplets are clear. These procedures should be done just prior to adsorbing the sample suspension. There is some question about how long the grids remain fresh; some publications suggest 30 min others insist that the carbonized films must be \u201caged\u201d in a refrigerator for at least a week prior to use. I have always found that freshly prepared carbonized Formvar support films work best if made fresh the day you need them. However, if they are stored in a petri dish sealed with Parafilm, they can remain hydrophilic for several days.The Cytochrome C method has been proven enormously useful and popular for observation of nucleic acids, but it cannot be satisfactorily used for association of nucleic acids with protein molecules, such as enzymes because of the obscuring effect of the bound Cytochrome C on the protein [23].Banerjee and Iyer reported that when the droplet method is used to visualize the linearized plasmid DNA (pCU 918), a significant fraction of molecules (30\u201340 %) are circular [24]. They suspected that because of the small surface area of the droplets, spreading of the protein becomes exceedingly difficult to control and it may serve to promote such artificial circularization of the plasmids. Therefore, they recommended that when the droplet method is used, formaldehyde is essential to prevent this artifact.Freeze-drying has also been used with the sandwich procedure and may provide certain advantages over glycerol drying. However, the overall distribution of macromolecules is not so uniform, and when specimen preparations are viewed at low magnification they exhibit a \u201cpatchy\u201d appearance. This patchiness is probably due to material being torn from the surface as the thin layer of ice is cleaved. Nevertheless, large areas of intact material with evenly distributed filaments can usually be found [25].It should be noted that the presence of nonvolatile salts, up to physiological concentrations, can be used with this technique as the retreating edge of the evaporating layer of glycerol\u2013buffer appears to sweep along unabsorbed molecules and salt ions still in solution, leaving the molecules of interest adsorbed unto the mica [12]. When freeze-drying, instead of glycerol drying, was used they also found that the sandwich technique was insensitive to concentrations of nonvolatile salts up to physiological concentrations. However, when higher concentrations of salts were used (e.g., NaCl up to 400 mM, Tris up to 100 mM, or phosphate up to 76 mM), washing the mica sheets with the absorbed macromolecules with ammonium acetate was necessary prior to vacuum drying to achieve consistently good results.The uranyl acetate fixes and stabilizes the viruses and bacteria as well as protecting them from the forces of air drying [26]. Washing the prep with a few drops of 30 % glycerol in ammonium acetate buffer works as well as negative staining with uranyl acetate and has been reported to preserve the integrity of the particles as well as critical point drying [27, 28].\n",
