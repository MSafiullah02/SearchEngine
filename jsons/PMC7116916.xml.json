SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is a respiratory illness that resembles severe pneumonia and is transmitted through close interpersonal contact. SARS reached Taiwan from mainland China in March of 2003. 312 people were confirmed to be infected and 82 people died before the epidemic disappeared in July of that year. Despite the low prevalence of SARS in the general population, the public strongly eschewed restaurants, shopping centers, and other public places (Chou et al., 2004, Siu and Wong, 2004). The high infection rate in hospitals also caused people to avoid the health care system: outpatient visits fell by 31% in April and May of 2003 (Hsieh et al., 2004). This drop occurred both in locations with and without SARS, and persisted for months after the epidemic had passed.",

Facing an increase in disease risk, people protect themselves and thereby limit the spread of infection. With few exceptions (de Paula et al., 2011, Gong, forthcoming), this literature has assumed that decision makers possess complete information, which is an unrealistic assumption in a disease outbreak. In even the most saturated media environment, public announcements only weakly indicate a person's idiosyncratic infection risk. Without a precise public signal, people may rely on private signals such as the opinions and actions of their peers. This mechanism may cause an \u201cinformation cascade\u201d that magnifies the response to an unfamiliar threat (Banerjee, 1992, Bikchandani et al., 1992, Welch, 1992). If social learning is an important determinant of behavior in this setting, it may determine the effectiveness of public policies to address a crisis.",

Reports of local and national SARS incidence provide public risk signals. We proxy for the risk signal of peers using the change in health care utilization among peers from a pre-SARS baseline, which derives from a simple model of health care demand. A regression of individual medical visits on these variables distinguishes between the contributions of public information and peer signals. Our analysis uses a nationally representative panel of medical claims of 1 million people (4.3% of Taiwan's population). This source allows us to quantify the number of outpatient visits by patient, provider and two-week period from 2001 to 2003 for a 16% subsample of this data set. We proxy for peer groups, which the claims data do not directly measure, using cohorts of patients who visit a common physician and facility.",

Patients may sort into peer groups because of common risk or health preferences. Heterogeneous supply shocks, such as office closures by some doctors, may also induce a spurious correlation. Patients in the same peer group may receive correlated signals of SARS risk if they obtain news from the same media sources. We address these concerns through a difference-in-difference design that compares the response of longtime community residents (\u201cnon-movers\u201d) to the response of recent arrivals (\u201cmovers\u201d). Although these groups face a similar (vanishingly small) risk of contracting SARS, non-movers have stronger social ties to their communities. We find that non-movers respond more to their peers than to local SARS incidence but less than to national SARS incidence. This identification strategy places a lower bound on the peer effect because it is based on a differential response.",

We evaluate this assumption through a complementary approach in which we address common unobservables by controlling for current peer visits. This strategy relies on variation in lagged peer visits for identification. Fixing current visits, a peer group whose visits were previously high conveys a stronger signal of SARS risk than a group whose visits were previously low. By specifically controlling for the visits of non-mover peers, we deal with the concern that shocks specific to non-movers confound the difference-in-difference regressions. In a final falsification test, we apply our methodology to the annual drop in visits that occurs during Chinese New Year and find that peer effects do not explain this phenomenon.",

Information is scarce during a novel epidemic, as even experts lack basic facts about the disease. In the absence of more reliable signals, people may learn from the behaviors and perceptions of their peers. Several mechanisms other than social learning may contribute to our peer effect estimate. In principle, SARS contagion among peers may cause a positive correlation in peer visits during the SARS period. This mechanism is not a serious confound in practice because SARS prevalence is very low, even in the highest-risk townships.1\nAlternatively, people may imitate rather than learn from their peers. We cannot distinguish learning from imitation without richer data. Finally, the visits of peers may be negatively correlated through congestion at health care facilities, which also causes our estimates to be a lower bound.",

Studies have demonstrated social learning in the context of technology adoption and consumption (e.g. Conley and Udry, 2010, Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995, Moretti, 2011, Munshi, 2004). Studies of learning and medical utilization (Deri, 2005, Oster and Thornton, 2011) consider day-to-day decisions rather than behavior during a medical crisis. Because of the dearth of objective information during an emergency, the nature and magnitude of social learning may be different than under ordinary circumstances. Randomization is not available as a tool to study social interactions during a crisis. We build upon attempts to identify peer effects in observational data by defining a subset of people who are less exposed to peers.

For instance, objectively small terrorism and health risks have large impacts on commerce (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Blunk et al., 2006, Kraipornsak, 2010). Becker and Rubinstein (2011) find that Israeli tourists respond more strongly to terrorism risk than local residents, and suggest that people who regularly confront risk may invest in the ability to surmount an emotional response. Social interactions may also explain why people adopt mistaken beliefs and respond in extreme ways to a crisis. The magnitude of this private response determines the impact of a crisis. Just as air travel reductions after 9/11 caused more people to die in traffic accidents than in the attacks themselves (Blalock et al., 2009), health care avoidance during SARS may have caused more deaths than the epidemic itself.2\n",

Becker and Rubinstein (2011) suggest that people overreact to unfamiliar risks. In our setting, overreaction does not explain the sharp increase in the coefficient of variation in Fig. 7, while social interactions can explain this pattern. Without a theory of differential overreaction by non-movers, overreaction also fails to explain the differential correlation between the behavior of non-movers and their peers. In our analysis, both public signals and time fixed effects may embody overreaction to SARS. The simulation, which shows similar responses to public information and social interactions, suggests that peer effects contribute in an important way to the response to SARS in Taiwan.",

Complementary utility may lead people to watch the same television shows or wear the same clothing brands as their peers. Complementarity in terms of the budget sets may cause peers to share transportation to common activities. A medical visit is distinct from entertainment or clothing because health is idiosyncratic, and so a peer's health care utilization does not strongly influence someone's utility of a medical visit. Imitation due to cost sharing (e.g. carpooling to medical facilities) could contribute to the peer effect, however this effect would need to become stronger during SARS to contribute to identification, which we do not suspect.

By interacting socially, peers may transmit communicable diseases to one another, causing a positive correlation in their medical visits. SARS prevalence is too low for SARS contagion to have a noticeable effect on our estimates. SARS incidence peaked nationally in Period 10 of 2003, in which there were 270 probable cases. During this period, there were 928,700 outpatient visits, which was 230,300 fewer than Period 10 of 2002, so that SARS diagnoses comprise 0.029% of visits during this period. The maximum of SARS incidence occurs during Period 9 of 2003 in the Jhongjheng District of Taipei City, in which there were 96 probable cases (0.00006 SARS cases per capita), so that SARS diagnoses comprise 0.57% of visits in Jhongjheng during this period. SARS contagion contributes positively to health care utilization during this period, which works against the aggregate decline in visits that we observe. Our estimates are robust if we limit the sample to the 68% of township \u00d7 period observations with zero SARS incidence.",

By skewing individual risk perceptions, social learning may also influence the demand for public policies related to risk, such as counter-terrorism or nuclear energy initiatives. As a result, authorities may wish to control the extent of social learning about risk. Further research should examine how education campaigns or more precise public signals affect the reliance on information from peers.",
