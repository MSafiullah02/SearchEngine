From 1851 to 1903, at least 11 international sanitary conferences were convened to address the threats of cholera, yellow fever, and plague.1 The motivation for these conferences was not merely the protection of individual health but also the implementation of disease control so that the benefits of industrialization, global trade, and cross-border traffic would not be unduly hampered.",

Through climate change, the impact of human activities in a few countries can affect harvests, the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and the potential for global natural disasters.11 Even among countries with strong public health programs, harmonization of standards and processes is important for effective and efficient collective action. Today\u2019s global health governance structures include a complex web of UN agencies, public/private partnerships, donor and recipient governments, foundations, corporations, and civil society organizations. A recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation identified 50 multilateral international health treaties, commitments, partnerships, and other agreements, 26 of which are legally binding under international law. The United States is a party to 36 of these of agreements, 16 of which are legally binding. These agreements cover many topical areas, including specific diseases, environmental issues, trade and intellectual property, specific populations (eg, refugees or children), health security/preparedness, water, and food/nutrition.12\n",

Beyond the eradication of smallpox (an event that has likely saved more than 20 million lives since 1977), WHO technical leadership has also played a role in the near eradication of polio; the containment of the deadly 2003 SARS epidemic; the landmark 2003 WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO); and the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Compared with the previous IHR that was focused on classical diseases of international importance, plague, yellow fever, and cholera, the 2005 revision is more powerful and practical in that it encompasses all acute public health risks of transnational significance. The new IHR defines broad reporting requirements and establishes the authority of the WHO to initiate disease-control actions, if necessary, through use of information sources other than country governments. The new IHR also requires countries to strengthen their existing surveillance capacities.",

The proposed budget for 2010 to 2011 was $4.94 billion before currency adjustments. Because only about 18.8% of the WHO budget comes from the dues assessments of member countries, its flexibility in focusing its program based on the scientific priorities it determines is constrained. Wealthier countries pay larger assessments and thus have more influence over the direction of WHO programming than poorer countries, which have the greater need for help. Moreover, the remaining 81.2% of the budget is projected as \u201cvoluntary contributions,\u201d which are largely earmarked by donors for specific purposes.17 This arrangement contributes to fragmented programming and perhaps to certain donor-influenced compromises. In this century, the WHO also faces growing challenges. Although its members are sovereign governments, many other powerful actors (including nongovernmental entities, such as other UN agencies, foundations, corporations, and civil society organizations) have entered the global-health arena.

This connection, embodied in the one-health concept, is most evident in the context of emerging zoonotic diseases and food safety.21 In 2009, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee concluded that the OIE rules lacked critical provisions found in the 2005 WHO IHR, provisions that would be valuable for an organization involved in protecting animals capable of transmitting infections to humans. The committee recommended that the OIE create legally binding obligations for members to develop and maintain core surveillance-and-response capabilities, that the OIE be authorized to publically disseminate the animal-disease information received from nongovernmental sources when the member state does not do so in a timely and accurate way, and that the OIE director general be empowered to declare animal-health emergencies and related recommendations as appropriate.22\n",

Contraceptive prevalence is expected to rise to 35% across assisted countries, reflecting an average annual increase of 2 percentage points.

Although this makes it harder for the WHO to lead, it also brings a wider array of talent and resources to bear on problems. Fig. 5\nillustrates an example of the partnership paradigm of global health governance today: the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership, a 500-member collaboration. Even though the WHO was one of the founders of RBM and hosts the secretariat, it is not positioned as the dominant core of the effort. The RBM partnership not only works to facilitate policy coordination at the global level but also executes an operating framework with performance targets reflective of the MDG malaria goal; it articulates technical strategies and provides multidirectional accountability through its partners forum. A decision-making partnership board with 27 members (6 ex-officio) represents the 7 broad RBM constituencies and meets periodically. There are 21 voting members of the board representing foundations (1 seat), malaria-endemic countries (8 seats), multilateral institutions (4 seats), NGOs (2 seats), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) donor countries (3 seats), private sector (2 seats), and research and academia (1 seat). The Stop TB Partnership (http://www.stoptb.org/) also has many similarities to RBM.",

It has since taken on many other disease-control efforts directed toward conditions, including malaria, schistosomiasis, yellow fever, and vaccine-preventable childhood infections. In 1914, it created the China Medical Board to develop modern medicine in that country but arguably its most significant contributions to advancing global health governance were investments to establish the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health as well as schools of public health at Harvard and the University of Michigan. Reflecting the emergence of the new era in global health governance, in 1998 the Rockefeller Foundation established an initiative to create innovative new public-private partnerships, including the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, and the International Partnership on Microbicides.38\n",

Overall access to care is still lacking or suboptimal for billions of people. Access to clean water and essential medicines is uneven. Modern pharmaceuticals are often unaffordable or unavailable. Globalization has brought some health benefits to the world\u2019s poorest, but it has also fostered the transnational spread of infectious diseases, the brain drain of skilled health care workers from developing countries, and the trade in poor-quality food and pharmaceuticals. Surveillance for human and animal diseases is of variable quality and the enforcement of the relevant regulatory regimes needs improvement. Despite the challenges that remain in coordinating the many diverse players now engaged in global health, the vast increase in the commitment of both private and public wealth over the last decade is to be celebrated. Commitments have gone far beyond money and have brought forth legions of individuals who choose to commit themselves in the global context to the universal value of health. Research is steadily discovering and developing new technological interventions. New mechanisms of cooperation have been developed, and there is a growing interest in implementation science and in program evaluation to increase accountability and effectiveness.
