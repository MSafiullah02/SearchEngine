Individuals who have recovered from a viral infection, or who have received a therapeutic vaccination, contain a population of antibodies that is capable of contributing to a life-long immunity from the virus. These are defined as \"native antibodies,\" i.e., antibodies in exactly the configurations created by a functioning, intact human immune system. Native antibodies are most commonly obtained by methods that immortalize primary B cells by hybridoma formation or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. They are distinct from human or humanized antibodies derived from recombinant DNA or transgenic mouse systems, which may not accurately replicate the complete, wild-type structure of full-length antibodies produced by the human immune system in situ. The native human antibody repertoire has tremendous potential as a source for antiviral antibody therapeutics because it contains definitive immunologic solutions to human viral diseases and is likely to be the safest overall for human clinical use. Polyclonal antibody therapeutics of unselected and disease-specific native immunoglobulins are effective in some clinical situations. These intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the starting point for exploring the potential value of the native human antibody immunome, but they do not address the vast spectrum of viral diseases for which antibodies have potential therapeutic efficacy. Over the past 25 years, ongoing efforts to improve methods for cloning native human antibodies that can capture and amplify the antiviral capabilities of IVIG have progressed, demonstrating the value of this approach and justifying further exploration.

PV B19 is a small DNA virus that in normal children causes fifth disease, characterized by fever, malaise, and a typical bilateral cheek/ facial rash (Broliden et al. 2006) . In most people, parvovirus infection is self-limited. However, parvovirus can cause complications in susceptible individuals resulting from its ability to infect erythroid progenitor cells. Patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants or who have sickle cell anemia can have an acute aplastic crisis as a result of parvovirus infection (Broliden et al. 2006; Eid et al. 2006) . Fetuses carried by pregnant women infected with the virus can develop severe anemia, complicated by an infectious myocarditis, that can induce hydrops fetalis and fetal loss (Ergaz and Ornoy 2006) .

Differences in the IVIGs were also noted, in that two had high levels of antibodies specific for adenovirus and two had high levels of St. Louis encephalitis virus antibodies. A panel of eight IVIG preparations was recently examined for the presence of vaccinia virus (VV) neutralizing ability (Goldsmith et al. 2004 ). All were found to contain significant in vitro and in vivo VV neutralizing activity, at 3%-9% of the measured titer of standard VV hyperimmune globulins (VIG), even though widespread VV vaccination has not been practiced for nearly the past 30 years. IVIG may also have clinical activity against West Nile virus (WNV). A WNV patient in Israel recovered from the infection after treatment with IVIG. It is notable that WNV is endemic in Israel and the Israeli IVIG had a high titer of WNV antibodies. In contrast, IVIG from the United States was not found to contain WNV antibodies.

Some of the viruses treated with this category of therapeutics are hepatitis B (HBV), CMV, VZV, VV, rabies, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The first three of these viruses share the capability of reactivation in patients who become immunocompromised. In these settings, hyperimmune globulins are used to ameliorate the immunodeficiency and bring the reactivated viruses under control. VV causes an acute infection that can have severe manifestations in immunocompromised hosts and can be mitigated by VV-specific hyperimmune globulins. Rabies induces an acute infection that is invariably fatal, unless treated, even in immunocompetent individuals. Rabies immune globulins (RIG) provide initial control of the virus while a concomitantly administered vaccine induces permanent immunity. RSV can cause fatal bronchiolitis in premature infants and recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. In these patient populations, RSV immunoglobulins (RSV-IG) are effective for RSV prophylaxis and treatment. The different roles for hyperimmune globulins are empirically defined and reflect the unique clinical features of each virus and the infected hosts. For most of these viruses, native human antibodies have been cloned that may possess some of the functions provided by the hyperimmune globulins. Future optimized hyperimmune globulins would consist of these or similar antibodies in completely defined monoclonal or oligoclonal antiviral therapies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 209, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Hyperimmune Globulins and Native Human Antibodies for Viral Diseases"}, {"text": "HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that is transmitted by direct contact with infected bodily fluids (Hollinger and Liang 2001) . In normal individuals, hepatitis B will generally induce a self-limited hepatitis, but it has the capacity to establish a chronic active state that can eventually lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is prepared from a small number of donors hyperimmunized with the HBsAg vaccine (Terrault and Vyas 2003) . The main three categories of use for HBIG are (1) post-exposure prophylaxis for nonimmune contacts, (2) inhibition of vertical transmission of the virus at birth, and (3) prevention of relapse in HBV-positive patients following orthotopic liver transplantation. Following a suspected infected needle-stick or fluid exposure, HBIG is recommended to be administered in combination with the HBsAg vaccine (CDC 1984) . Maternal-fetal transmission can be inhibited by administration of HBIG and the HBsAg vaccination immediately after birth to infants of mothers positive for circulating HBe antigen and HBV DNA (Lo et al. 1985; Ip et al. 1989; Kabir et al. 2006) . Further improvements in outcomes may also be achieved by passive immunization of HBe-positive mothers with HBIG prior to delivery (Xu et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2007 ). The successful use of orthotopic liver transplantation to treat end-stage liver disease caused by HBV depends on the prevention of reactivation of the virus in the immunocompromised, post-transplant patient (Gish and McCashland 2006) . HBIG can collaborate with nucleoside antiviral agents to limit reactivation in these patients, but there remains a risk of reactivation of disease after the discontinuation of prophylactic therapy. In this setting, the cost of long-term HBIG administration may potentially be reduced through the use of low-dose combination therapy regimens (Di Paolo et al. 2004; Ferretti et al. 2004 ). Many native human IgG antibodies specific for HBV have been cloned using hybridoma and EBV-immortalization methods (Stricker et al. 1985; Colucci et al. 1986; Desgranges et al. 1987; Ichimori et al. 1987; Tiebout et al. 1987; Andris et al. 1992; Ehrlich et al. 1992; Sa'adu et al. 1992; Heijtink et al. 1995) . Animal data are difficult to obtain with HBV infection, but a combination of two human antibodies administered to a chimpanzee chronically infected with HBV was able to transiently (< 7 days) reduce the levels of circulating virus (Heijtink et al. 1999 ). An important concern regarding the efficacy of cloned antibodies for HBV is the apparent ability of the virus to escape neutralization by polyclonal HBIG. This phenomenon has been observed in liver transplant patients who had recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation despite HBIG therapy. In three studies, the existence of mutations in antigenic regions of HBsAg correlated with resistant or recurrent HBV infection (Carman et al. 1996; Ghany et al. 1998; Terrault et al. 1998) . Furthermore, the length of time of therapy correlated with the likelihood of finding mutated HBV strains (Ghany et al. 1998; Terrault et al. 1998 ). The potential failure of polyclonal antibodies may suggest that the virus would be particularly adept at escaping the effects of a monoclonal or oligoclonal antibody therapeutic. A pair of antibodies with significant HBV binding had considerably less affinity for a variant HBV strain that had arisen in a patient following a year of HBIG therapy (Heijtink et al. 1995) . Nonetheless, it may be possible to create an oligoclonal HBIG equivalent or superior to polyclonal HBIG by identifying two or three noncross-resistant antibodies directed at relatively stable portions of HBsAg.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 137, "text": "(Hollinger and Liang 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 487, "end": 511, "text": "(Terrault and Vyas 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 916, "end": 926, "text": "(CDC 1984)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1137, "text": "(Lo et al. 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1153, "text": "Ip et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1172, "text": "Kabir et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1321, "text": "(Xu et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1338, "text": "Xiao et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1575, "text": "(Gish and McCashland 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1941, "text": "Paolo et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1962, "text": "Ferretti et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2103, "text": "(Stricker et al. 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2124, "text": "Colucci et al. 1986;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2148, "text": "Desgranges et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2170, "text": "Ichimori et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2191, "text": "Tiebout et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2211, "text": "Andris et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2232, "text": "Ehrlich et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2252, "text": "Sa'adu et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2274, "text": "Heijtink et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2508, "end": 2529, "text": "(Heijtink et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2961, "end": 2981, "text": "(Carman et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2982, "end": 3000, "text": "Ghany et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3001, "end": 3022, "text": "Terrault et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 3130, "end": 3149, "text": "(Ghany et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3150, "end": 3170, "text": "Terrault et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 3521, "end": 3543, "text": "(Heijtink et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis B Virus"}, {"text": "CMV is a double-stranded DNA virus that, in normal individuals, induces a febrile illness that resembles mononucleosis from EBV, with chills, fatigue, headache, and malaise (Gandhi and Khanna 2004) .

CMV may be reactivated in a previously infected person who becomes immunosuppressed. Alternatively, a de novo CMV infection may be transmitted to a CMV-negative recipient of an organ from a CMV-positive donor.

Using heteromyeloma fusion partner cell lines, a wide variety of native human antibodies have been cloned that were specific for important viral pathogens.

Shown are G-banded human chromosomes in a hybridoma that secretes a human antibody. Murine chromosomes are not shown. Stable antibody expression results from the ability of the hybrid cells to maintain intact human chromosomes assayed individually for the binding specific of its particular antibody. Because of practical considerations, hybridomas are generally assayed in pools of dozens or more clones, but advanced screening technologies may significantly increase the yields of specific antiviral antibodies that could be obtained. New antibody screening methods differ in how they achieve the core objective of associating individual cells with the antibodies they produce. In the selected lymphocyte antibody method (SLAM), primary B cells are cultured in the presence of complement and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) conjugated to the antigen of interest (Babcook et al. 1996) . B cells expressing antibodies specific for the SRBC-conjugated antigen can be identified because their secreted antibodies cause localized hemolytic reactions. Although it was originally conceived that this method would be used with primary B cells from which immunoglobulin genes would be directly cloned by RT-PCR, this method may be useful for screening hybridomas or EBV-transformed cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1155, "end": 1176, "text": "(Babcook et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 240, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "High-Throughput Screening Technologies"}, {"text": "Three methods combine the isolation of individual hybridoma cells with fluorescent assays for antigen binding. The first distributes individual hybridomas into tiny wells (0.1-1 nl volume) created on glass slides using a microengraving technique (Love et al. 2006) . The secreted antibodies are captured for analysis by sandwiching the arrayed hybridoma supernatants with a capture slide that is coated with secondary antibody or antigen. The bound complexes are then detected with fluorescently labeled antigens or secondary antibodies, respectively. Multiple capture slides can be used with a single hybridoma microarray, enabling cells to be screened for a variety of antigen-binding specificities. An alternate method immobilizes hybridomas on a filter through which secreted antibodies diffuse and then bind to a plate coated with a secondary antibody (www.trellisbio.com; Potera 2005) . The plate is then probed with a panel of fluorescent probes that can be used in a combinatorial fashion to allow simultaneous screening for many different antigens. Computerized microscopy is used to analyze the binding reactions. Hybridomas can also be enveloped in an agarose matrix that captures the antibodies secreted by the hybridomas. For this purpose, secondary antibodies are attached to the agarose through a biotin-avidin bridge (Gray et al. 1995) . The secreted antibodies are thus stably associated with the cells that produce them. The porous agarose matrix enables the hybridomas to be screened for binding to fluorescently labeled antigens. The matrix also offers structural stabilization for the hybridomas so that they can be analyzed and sorted by FACS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 264, "text": "(Love et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 878, "end": 890, "text": "Potera 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1351, "text": "(Gray et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High-Throughput Screening Technologies"}, {"text": "In one of our laboratories (J.B.) we have begun experiments with the FMAT 8200 Cellular Detection System.

The secondary antibodies detect specific antibody bound to the beads, thereby concentrating the fluorescence into punctate signals that are detected by a mechanized plate reader. The advantage of this method is that it enables high-throughput screening of hybridoma supernatants, but it does not provide a means of isolating single cells prior to screening.

In addition, these methods simplify the exploration of the antibody repertoires of genetically diverse individuals. Over the past 27 years, successive technical advances have improved the methods for cloning native human antibodies such that they now may be able to contribute meaningfully to ongoing efforts with phage display and transgenic mouse methods.
