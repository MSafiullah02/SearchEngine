Rotaviruses are round particles 68 nm in diameter and are composed of two separate shells (capsids). The capsids surround a 38-nm icosahedral core structure, which in turn encloses the 11 double strands of RNA in the core. This structure gives the virus its characteristic appearance of a wide-rimmed wheel with spokes radiating from the hub, from which its name was derived (rota is Latin for \u201cwheel\u201d).8\n",

            "text": "Rotaviruses are classified based on antigenic properties of various proteins found in the capsid structure. The VP6 protein on the inner capsid of the virus determines the rotavirus group.9 Most viruses infecting humans are classified as group A, although rotaviruses from groups B and C have occasionally been associated with human diarrheal disease as well. The next level of classification is the subgroup, which is determined by other antigenic differences among the VP6 proteins. At least two subgroups are known to exist.9 Subgroup typing has proved important in the study of patients who experience more than one episode of rotaviral infection. In these patients, recurrent infections usually but not necessarily involve agents of different subgroups, which suggests that subgroup antigens are not sufficient for inducing the production of protective antibodies.10 Finally, the rotaviruses are classified into a variety of serotypes based on the antigenic differences of VP7 glycoprotein or the VP4 protease-sensitive hemagglutinin proteins that are found in the outer capsid.11 VP4 is designated as the P antigenic protein because it is cleaved by the protease trypsin at the intestinal level, and VP7 is designated as the G antigenic protein because it is a glycosylated structure. There are at least 42 different G/P strains with different serotype combinations. However, five serotypes, G1P8, G2P4, GP8, G4P8, and G9P8, are the predominant circulation rotavirus G/P serotypes.12 The prevalence of serotypes can fluctuate from year to year,13 and although the five most common serotypes are responsible for approximately 95% of infections worldwide, there are substantial geographical differences. For example, in a recent global study, G1P8 was responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but less than 30% in South America, Asia, and Africa.14\n",

Diarrhea caused by rotavirus usually lasts from 2 to 8 days.25 Shedding of virus into the intestinal lumen begins about 3 days after infection and may persist for as long as 3 weeks.26 A comparison of the characteristics of rotaviral infections with those of other enteric viruses is presented in Table 39-1\n. In addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with rotavirus often have respiratory tract symptoms.16 Unlike fever and vomiting, none of the respiratory manifestations associated with rotavirus infection are helpful in the recognition of rotaviral disease.27 The clinical symptoms of rotavirus infection are more severe in patients with underlying malnutrition. In the malnourished murine rotavirus model, a smaller inoculum is required for infection, less time is required for incubation, and the symptoms are more severe.28 In addition, rotavirus replication can occur in the liver and kidney, at least in immunocompromised hosts.29 Children and adults who are immunocompromised because of congenital immunodeficiency or because of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation sometimes experience severe or prolonged rotavirus gastroenteritis.7 The severity of rotavirus disease among children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to be similar to that among children without HIV infection.7\n",

In this outbreak, only some of the patients had diarrhea; the predominant clinical manifestation was vomiting and nausea. Virus particles were visualized by immune electron microscopy on fecal material derived from the Norwalk outbreak. This represented the first definitive association between a specific virus (Norwalk virus) and acute gastroenteritis. Subsequently a number of similar etiologic agents were identified; before the cloning of the prototype Norwalk virus genome,45 these viruses, which were a group of morphologically diverse, positive-stranded RNA viruses that caused acute gastroenteritis, were identified as Norwalk-like agents. These organisms were also named for the communities in which they were first isolated (e.g., Montgomery County, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, Taunton, Otofuke, and Sapporo viruses). Based on reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the sequence structure of these viruses has enabled their classification as human caliciviruses (HuCV).

Contamination of environmental surfaces with norovirus has been documented during outbreaks.54 Although previously referred to as \u201cwinter vomiting disease,\u201d norovirus produces outbreaks of disease that can occur throughout the year.55 Several characteristics of norovirus facilitate their spread in epidemics: (1) low infectious dose (fewer than 10 viral particles), (2) prolonged viral shedding, (3) stability of the virus in relatively high concentrations of chlorine and a wide range of temperatures, and (4) the fact that repeated infections can occur with reexposure.46\n",

By the second day of illness, blood and mucus are usually present in the stools, and tenesmus has become a prominent symptom. At this point, in approximately 50% of affected patients, the stool volume decreases, with only scant amounts of blood and mucus being passed.91 This pattern of bloody, mucus-containing stools is referred to as dysentery. Bacteremia is an uncommon feature of this illness, but several other complications have been reported, including seizures (in children), arthritis, purulent keratitis, and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Nonsuppurative arthritis is the most commonly occurring extraintestinal complication of shigellosis. Patients who carry the histocompatibility locus antigen HLA-B27 may be predisposed to the development of this complication as well as to the development of Reiter\u2019s syndrome. The association of seizures with shigellosis was earlier attributed to the neurotoxic effect of the Shigella toxin (Shiga toxin). It now seems likely, however, that the seizures may simply represent a subgroup of common febrile seizures and have no direct relation to the effects of Shiga toxin.",

Within the cells, the B subunits are cleaved away, and the remaining A subunit is shortened by proteolysis. This molecule is thought then to bind to the 60S ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis, leading to cell death and sloughing.96 This is the presumed mechanism for the cytotoxic effect.

Because disease caused by Campylobacter is usually mild and self-limited, supportive treatment alone should suffice. In cases of severe disease, erythromycin (10 mg/kg [maximum 500 mg] per dose, given every 6 hours for 5 to 7 days) has been recommended.97 The need for antibiotic therapy has been questioned, based in part on several studies demonstrating a decrease in the duration of excretion of Campylobacter after antibiotic treatment but no decrease in the duration of symptoms. In general, in these studies, antimicrobial therapy was begun late in the course of the illness. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, Salazar-Lindo and colleagues107 demonstrated a shortened duration of illness, from 4.2 to 2.5 days, in patients who received erythromycin by day 4 of their illness. For cases of Campylobacter septicemia, gentamicin (1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg per dose, intramuscularly or intravenously, given every 8 hours) is recommended, with chloramphenicol and erythromycin acceptable as alternatives. Tetracycline (250 to 500 mg per dose, intravenously, given every 6 to 12 hours) may be used in patients older than 8 years of age.97 Ciprofloxacin is an effective alternative agent but is not approved for use in children younger than 18 years of age. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for outbreaks of Campylobacter in day-care settings, because treatment has been shown to eliminate fecal shedding of organisms within 48 hours.104\n",

The intestinal epithelium remains intact with normal morphology. Vibrio species produce a toxin that is composed of a central subunit (A) surrounded by five B subunits; the latter bind to a ganglioside, GM1, which serves as the toxin receptor. This binding facilitates the transfer of the A subunit across the cell membrane, where it is cleaved into two components, denoted A1 and A2. The disulfide linkage between A1 and A2 is reduced to liberate an active A1 peptide, which acts as a catalyst to facilitate the transfer of adenosine diphosphate-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to a guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Gs). Gs then stimulates adenylate cyclase, located on the basolateral membrane, thereby increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This result in turn leads to chloride secretion and a net flux of fluid into the intestinal lumen.",

Often, the bacteria are raised on a pedestal-like structure as a result of this actin accumulation. A number of steps are probably responsible for the development of this attaching and effacing lesion. As proposed by Donnenberg and Kaper,146 EPEC pathogenesis consists of three phases: (1) localized adherence, which brings the bacteria in close contact with the enterocyte (e.g., docking); (2) signal transduction, including increases in intracellular calcium and protein phosphorylation; and (3) intimate adherence, a multigene process encoded in the bacterium by a locus of enterocyte effacement.147., 148.

There the bacteria depend on fimbriae (also called pili) to facilitate attachment to the mucosal surface and overcome the forward motion of peristalsis. This attachment process causes no detectable structural changes in the architecture of the brush border membrane but does allow the bacteria to release their enterotoxins, heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), in close proximity to the enterocyte brush border membrane where toxin receptors are present.152 These toxins in turn stimulate adenylate cyclase (in the case of LT) or guanylate cyclase (in the case of ST), and both ultimately result in a net fluid secretion from the intestine (see the reviews by Cohen and Giannella153 and by Sears and Kaper154). Two endogenous ligands for the ST receptor, guanylin and uroguanylin, have been identified.155., 156. This discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that ST is a superagonist and exerts its diarrheal action by means of usurping a normal secretory mechanisms in the intestine (e.g., by molecular mimicry of these less potent endogenous ligands). Uroguanylin may also act as a hormone regulating salt and water excretion in the kidney in response to an oral salt load.157\n",

In 1993 there was a large epidemic in the western United States; inadequately cooked hamburgers were again implicated as the cause. Aside from ground beef, many other food vectors have been implicated. Epidemics have been attributed to apple juice or cider, and large-scale outbreaks in Japan have been associated with bean sprouts. Contaminated water has also been a source of infection.171., 172. Common to all of these outbreaks is a reservoir of Stx-producing E. coli in the intestines of cattle and other animals that are asymptomatic. Infection is spread either by direct contact with intestinal contents or through droppings or water runoff from contaminated pastures. A low infectious dose for Stx-producing E. coli and the resistance of these organisms to gastric acid and to the food preserving process (high salt and drying) contribute to the high attack rate. The low infectious dose also contributes to frequent person-to-person transmission.166., 167., 168., 169.

There are currently six techniques for identification of Stx-producing E. coli: biochemical markers with serotyping (most commonly used), serum antibody tests, cytotoxin bioassays, DNA hybridization, PCR-based tests, and cytotoxin detection (including ELISAs). Some of these methods (e.g., toxin-based assays) detect the presence of cytotoxin-producing organisms, including non-O157 serotypes. It may be important to use both biochemical markers and toxin-based assays in clinical practice to identify organisms that are truly pathogenic.179 The increased use of non-culture-based methods, such as Shiga toxin enzyme immunoassays, has resulted in a dramatic increase in reports of non-O157 Stx-producing E. coli.\n",

Hemorrhagic colitis has been confused with a number of other conditions, including ischemic colitis, appendicitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, cecal polyp, pseudomembranous colitis, and an acute abdomen (ileitis). Therefore, an important aspect of treatment of Stx-associated hemorrhagic colitis is making the correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic studies such as angiography and laparotomy. The mainstay of therapy for hemorrhagic colitis is the management of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and gastrointestinal blood loss. Antimicrobial agents may help by killing the bacterial pathogens, but they may also cause harm by increasing the release and subsequent absorption of Stx.180 Trials of antibiotic treatment of Stx-producing E. coli infection are inconclusive. Although these organisms are uniformly sensitive to antimicrobials in vitro, at present there is no evidence that antimicrobial therapy is helpful in diminishing the severity of illness, shortening the duration of fecal excretion, or preventing HUS.181 Of greater concern is a study suggesting an increased incidence of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials.182 An attempt to assimilate findings of published series on the subject via a meta-analysis failed to identify an increased risk of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials.183 Regardless, until more data are available on this topic, most experts would agree that treatment of Stx-producing E. coli with antimicrobials is not advisable.184 Rifaximin does not cause replication of phage or strain lysis and therefore might not increase the risk of HUS, but it has not been studied in humans with O157 infection.185., 186.

During the outbreaks in Canada, a new hypervirulent strain, identified as BI/NAP1/027, was found to be responsible for the increased prevalence and severity.201 All pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce toxin A or B or both. This BI/NAP1/027 hypervirulent strain produces 16 times more toxin A and 23 times more toxin B than other strains and has now been found throughout the United States and in many parts of the world. Although rates of C. difficile infection are increasing coincidentally with this new strain, it does not appear that the increased prevalence is predominantly due to the emergence of the BI/NAP1/027 strain. Non-BI/NAP1/027 community-acquired strains appear to be more important to the overall increased disease burden. During 2005, nonhypervirulent strains caused severe disease in generally healthy persons in the community at a rate of 7.6 cases per 100,000 population without the usual risk factors of older age, exposure to health care facilities, or antimicrobial use.202 A 5-year retrospective study revealed an increase in the number of patients seen in the emergency department with community-acquired C. difficile infection.203 A recent prospective cohort study found C. difficile toxin in 6.7% of stool samples tested in children seen for diarrhea in a children\u2019s hospital emergency department in Seattle; this rate is may be an underestimate because in this study only toxin B positive strains were identified.204 A similar incidence of community-acquired C. difficile associated diarrhea was found in Connecticut.205\n",

Toxin B demonstrates cytotoxic effects. Most strains produce both toxins, but there are some that elaborate only one or none.207 A third \u201cbinary toxin\u201d or cytodistending toxin (CDT) (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase) is found in 1 to 16% of infected patients and may be associated with more severe diarrhea.
