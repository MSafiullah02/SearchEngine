            "text": "WHO reports Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak as shown in [38], [39]. During almost a month from 21 February the SARS virus spread without isolation of probable patients. Taking into account of the short incubation period which is estimated as 5\u20138 days (see [23]), it appears that the virus raged for more than a month without prevention. The number of probable patients appeared to grow exponentially in this period, and then the control of the human-to-human chain of transmission of the disease suppressed the growth rate of spreading. It may be considered that only one seed made a typical epidemic growth curve of the disease spread. Our concern is first what the appropriate probability distribution for the curve is; the logistic, the log-normal, the gamma, or the Weibull distribution may be fitted to the data provided by WHO [37].",

[20] are also used), our second concern is to know the ratio as soon as possible after the outbreak began. Since WHO opens the numbers of probable cases and the fatal cases to the public day by day, we can estimate the CFR by some censoring time T using the conditional likelihoods for both the probable and fatal cases; this approach is considered to be the truncated model approach. However, WHO, in addition to these two data cases, gave us the recovery (or cured) cases, which would be the fruitful information for the parameter estimation of the underlying probability distributions; we can also estimate the CFR using the probable and cured cases. We propose here a new estimation method for the parameters of the underlying distributions and the CFR using the three data sets of probable, fatal, and cured cases together. The trunsored model approach (Hirose [16], [18]) can do this, but the traditional truncated model approach cannot.",

Maller and Zhou [26], Zhou and Maller [43], Sun and Zhou [33], Vu et al. [35], Peng et al. [30] discussed the model as long-term survivors. Tsodikov et al. recently review the cure rates [34]. In such cases, r events within T are observed from n samples, but the ratio, pm, of the long-term survivors to the mixed populations is unknown. If n is unknown, the truncated model (e.g. Johnson et al. [22], Meeker and Escobar [29], Wallace et al. [36], and Klein and Moeschberger [24]) could be applied. However, the information n may be useful in our situation; one of the advantages to adopt this kind of model is described as the application of the likelihood ratio test in Hirose [16], [18].",

To estimate the CFR caused by SARS, the truncated model approach using the infected and fatal growth curves may be fine. However, the recovery rate by the same approach using the infected and cured growth curves may not be consistent with the CFR obtained by using the infected and fatal cases. Thus, the truncated approach cannot have such consistency. A new approach proposed here, the mixed trunsored model, can have, however. Donnelly et al.

When we set the censoring time on 25 May 2003, the 95% confidence interval for the CFR is computed as 13.60%\u2264pf\u226417.40%. This value seems to be acceptable. If the censoring time is set to the right far enough, e.g. on 11 July 2003, however, the estimated number of patients, m\u02c61=1755.71, and the estimated number of deaths, m\u02c62=298.66, become very close to the observed numbers of patients, 1755, and deaths, 298, by that time; in other resampling cases, the results are much the same. Then, the 95% confidence interval for the CFR is computed as 16.90%\u2264pf\u226417.09%. Such very small confidence intervals are also reported elsewhere [6]. After the outbreaks are completely ceased, e.g. based on data as of the 31 December 2003, the CFR might be computed with extremely small variance, if we use the conditional likelihood. For example, in Hong Kong, the CFR would become to be just 299/1755   (=17.0370370\u2026%) if no new patients, deaths, and recoveries were observed at all after 31 December 2003; similarly in Taiwan, just 37/346   (=10.69\u2026%) is expected; in Singapore, just 33/238   (=13.86\u2026%); in Canada, just 43/251   (=17.13\u2026%). However, the number of deaths in Hong Kong, for example, may differ from that in other situations; for example, the number of deaths 299 could be 301 by chance; then, the CFR would be changed to some other value (301/1755   (=17.15099715\u2026%>17.09%)). Assuming that the CFR of SARS is supposed to be some constant value, then the number of deaths would be varied by chance. The CFRs in various districts could be fluctuated, but they would be covered by some interval, say [0.1, 0.2]. This is the reason why I think that the very small confidence intervals obtained by using the truncated model are paradoxical.",

A very rough interval for the CFR, [12, 18]%, includes points in the 95% confidence intervals of Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam, but does not include points in the 95% confidence interval of China. According to [37], 325 cases have been discarded in Taiwan since 11 July 2003 because Laboratory information was insufficient or incomplete for 135 discarded cases, of which 101 died. World-wide, the CFR of about 9.6% (including Chinese cases) has been announced by media. However, this estimate should be treated cautiously; this is caused mainly by the Chinese CFR, and this value, about 6.6%, is very different from those in other countries. There would be reasons for such a very different value of the CFR. One reason would be that Chinese infected cases were counted circumspectly. However, a noticeable reference is also seen (see [5]), in which Chinese medicine is found to improve the case survival rate in the treatment of SARS. In any case, it would be appropriate that the SARS CFR is estimated without the Chinese case if we consider the safety side. In such a case, it is roughly estimated to be about 12\u201318%, worldwide.",

Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases, here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases, can be modeled by the generalized logistic distribution function. The truncated data model approach using the infected and fatal cases can estimate the case fatality ratio of the disease, but it also estimates the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries; these estimates differ from each other in early censoring time stage. To circumvent this inconsistency, and to obtain reasonable estimates, the mixed trunsored model, which is an extension of the censored and truncated unified model, is found to be useful in estimating the case fatality ratio of SARS, when we use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries together. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be about 12\u201318% worldwide, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.",
