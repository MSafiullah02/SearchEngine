The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was identified as the origin of the infection, causing the area to shut down. However, a large fluctuation of visitors around the area during the Spring Festival caused the infection to rapidly spread to other regions of China. With the use of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), researchers identified the cause being a novel coronavirus labeled as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), later also called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2,3].",

This viral S-protein binds with the human protein receptor ACE2 [11]. ACE2 is abundant in lung, heart, kidney, and adipose tissue [12,13].

Mild and asymptomatic cases tend to shed 10 days (between 8\u201315 days) after symptom resolution [16,32,34], with 90 % resolving after 10 days and nearly all cases resolving after 15 days [16,32]. Severe cases continue shedding up until 25 days after initial symptoms arise. Severe cases also have 60 times more viral load than mild cases [40]. However, the infectious potential based on severity has not been discovered. Due to these findings, the Chinese Municipal Health Commission has recommended against discharging patients until the patient has remained afebrile for three days and RT-PCR becomes negative [41].",

This correlates with a high positive likelihood ratio of 64, but a poor negative likelihood ratio of 0.3. Studies have started performing two sequential RT-PCRs to ensure true negative cases [36,37]. RT-PCR tends to present negative-to-positive at a mean of 5.1 days, and positive-to-negative at 6.9 days [36]. Recommendations are to acquire a repeat RT-PCR 3 days after an initial negative result.

A significantly elevated LDH (>365 units/L) presents a positive likelihood ratio of 58 for mortality based on the results by Yan et al. [85]. High sensitivity-CRP also has a positive likelihood ratio of 17, but a negative likelihood ratio of 0. Lymphopenia presents a small positive likelihood ratio of 2.65 and a small-moderate negative likelihood ratio of 0.37 [85,85,86]. Other laboratory values that suggest a high mortality risk if elevated include aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), D-dimer, neutrophil count, prothrombin time, procalcitonin, and high-sensitivity and regular cardiac troponin [28,[43], [44], [45], [46], [47],59,[84], [85], [86]]. Low monocytes, platelets, and albumin also suggest high mortality risk [28,44,45,47,87].",
