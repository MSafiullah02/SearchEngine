A model-based analysis using a retrospective cohort of all hospitalized children with CSF EV PCR testing done between November 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome measured was the potential date of discharge if the EV PCR result had been available on the same day. Patients with positive EV PCR were considered for potential earlier discharge once clinically stable with no reason for hospitalization other than intravenous antibiotics. Descriptive statistics and cost-sensitivity analyses were performed. CSF EV PCR testing was done on 153 patients, of which 44 (29%) had a positive result. Median test TAT was 5.3 days (IQR 3.9-7.6). Median hospital LOS was 5 days (IQR 3-12). Most (86%) patients received intravenous antibiotics with mean duration of 5.72 \u00b1 6.51 days. No patients with positive EV PCR had a serious bacterial infection. We found that same-day test TAT would reduce LOS and duration of intravenous antibiotics by 0.50 days (95%CI 0.33-0.68) and 0.67 days (95%CI 0.42-0.91), respectively. Same-day test TAT was associated with a cost reduction of 342.83CAD (95%CI 178.14-517.00) per patient with suspected EV meningitis. Compared with sending specimens to a reference laboratory, performing CSF EV PCR in-hospital with same-day TAT was associated with decreased LOS, antibiotic therapy, and cost per patient.",

The clinical course of central nervous system (CNS) EV disease is mostly mild and self-resolving [3, 4] . However, EV infection can be clinically indistinguishable from some serious bacterial infections (SBI), including meningitis. This results in potentially unnecessary hospitalization and empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy [5] . With a positive EV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result on a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample, clinicians can be highly confident that the illness is not bacterial in origin. Thus, identifying EV in the CSF has been shown to shorten hospital length of stay (LOS) and antibiotic therapy duration [3, 6] .",

It has sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% with results available in as short as 1 h [5] . At our center, CSF EV PCR testing is sent out to a reference laboratory, with long TATs due to sample transport, batching, and delays in result transmission. This practice also increases the risk of specimen loss or quality degradation, and transcriptional errors. However, there are now commercially available one-step, random-access assays approved by the FDA that can identify EV in the CSF in~1 h, allowing for same-day results [7, 8] . We hypothesized that, compared to sending CSF to a reference laboratory for EV PCR, testing inhospital with same-day TAT would be associated with improved patient care and reduced costs per patient with suspected EV meningitis from the healthcare system perspective. Thus, we aimed to compare our current practice (based on send-out testing) with a simulated scenario of CSF EV PCR testing in-house with same-day results. Our primary objective was to estimate the potential impact of same-day CSF EV PCR results on hospital LOS and intravenous antibiotic use. Our secondary objective was to determine the potential economic impact, per tested patient with suspected EV meningitis, of in-hospital testing with same-day TAT.",

Per diem costs of hospitalization (general ward, pediatric intensive care unit, and neonatal intensive care unit) and Pediatric Day Center visits were obtained from the MUHC Finance Department. Costs of intravenous medications were obtained from MUHC Pharmacy. Physician billing costs were based on the R\u00e9gie de l'Assurance Maladie du Qu\u00e9bec billing handbook, and vary according to weekday/weekend visit, the specialty of the consultant, the care unit the patient was admitted to, and the age of the patient [17] . To estimate physician billing costs, we assumed that the treating physician billed for two visits per day, which corresponds to morning and afternoon clinical rounds. We assumed that consultant services would charge for a consultation on the first visit and follow-up visits for each subsequent documented patient encounter, to a maximum of two visits per day. Regarding EV CSF PCR testing, the Quebec Ministry of Health assigns a value of 34 CAD per sample to the assay performed at the reference laboratory and we estimated local CSF EV PCR testing would cost 175 CAD per sample [18] . In our center, current laboratory facilities and infrastructure could allow the implementation of CSF EV PCR. Hence, capital costs for implementing in-hospital testing (i.e., acquisition of new instruments/platforms) were not included.",

Because the economic effects of a diagnostic strategy may depend on disease characteristics, pretest probability (i.e., disease prevalence in population tested), and test cost, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of changes in key variables used in the analysis. Pretest probability was varied from 15-45%, in-hospital test cost from 34$-300$, test TAT lengthened to 48 h, and testing restricted to peak EV season (May to October or July to October) or to patients with pleocytosis or young infants < 60 days of age.

At our institution, the test is available to clinicians, but specimens are sent to a reference laboratory, with associated delays in result reporting. To our knowledge, no study has yet modeled the clinical and economic impact of performing EV PCR locally compared to sending specimens to a reference laboratory. In our simulated cohort, we found that implementing an in-hospital PCR with same-day TAT would reduce hospital LOS and intravenous antibiotic therapy, thereby reducing direct healthcare costs by 342.83 CAD per patient tested. Consistent with previous literature demonstrating that the greatest impact of CSF EV PCR testing is among patients with a positive result, we assumed that only a positive test result, indicating an etiology that does not require antimicrobial therapy, would affect patient management. Aronson et al. found that infants \u2264 60 days of age with positive EV PCR had onethird shorter LOS compared to infants with a negative test result. However, a reduction of LOS for the entire population tested was not demonstrated [20] . We estimated that both the The economic effect of this diagnostic strategy is positively associated with disease prevalence in the population being tested. The EV positivity rate in our study was high (29%) and may not be sustained and/or expected in other settings. However, identification of subgroups with highest pretest probability of having EV meningitis can increase the clinical impact of testing and associated cost reductions. One approach could be to limit EV PCR testing to patients with CSF pleocytosis. However, data on the exact frequency of positive EV PCR in patients without pleocytosis and on the effect of testing on LOS in this subgroup are lacking [3, 5] . In our study, 6.8% of CSF EV PCR-positive patients did not have CSF pleocytosis, lower than the proportions described in other studies (12-18%) [5, 6, 20] . We also estimated greater cost savings among infants \u2264 60 days of age. Although inhouse testing still demonstrated cost reductions in our simulated cohort when test TAT was extended to 48 h, it was~75% less than the base case scenario of same-day TAT. Therefore, EV CSF testing using random access PCR assays that do not require batching may have higher potential for cost reduction. However, other factors (e.g., batch size, cost per run and technologist time) also need to be considered.",

Testing non-CSF specimens can be particularly useful when EV CSF PCR is not available or the testing process is associated with long TAT. In our study, only 57% of patients with positive EV CSF PCR had a positive result in a respiratory specimen, compared to 10% in EV CSF PCR-negative patients. Similarly, in EV CSF PCRpositive patients, nine of 16 (56%) of stool specimens were positive. One can conclude that isolation of EV in non-CSF specimens may increase the likelihood of EV meningitis in patients with pleocytosis. Larger studies, however, are needed to better evaluate the predictive value of detecting EV nucleic acid in non-CSF samples. Of note, some commercially available multiplex PCR assays for respiratory viruses cannot differentiate between rhinovirus and enterovirus due to the genetic similarity of these picornaviruses, which may limit the utility of a positive result from a [23] .

            "text": "This study has several limitations. It was conducted at a single center in a public healthcare system, and results may not be generalizable to other settings. It is also limited by its retrospective nature; estimations of potential earlier discharge dates or earlier cessation of intravenous antimicrobials in our simulated cohort were dependent on the accuracy of documentation in patient charts. Also, in our base-case analysis, we may have underestimated the true cost savings by using the estimated cost of one of the most expensive commercial EV PCR assays approved in Canada for use on CSF specimens. Furthermore, the potential impact on other ancillary testing (e.g., brain imaging) was not assessed, making the study estimates of potential cost reductions more conservative. However, we have addressed uncertainty regarding economic analyses by performing several sensitivity analyses in which we varied the values of key variables associated with costs. We found that in all scenarios, in-hospital testing would be cost saving. We were also limited by not being able to reliably estimate capital costs of acquiring an instrument for in-hospital CSF EV PCR with same-day TAT, for laboratories that did not already have such a platform. This was partly because of the wide variability of costs associated with acquiring new equipment, due to the many different testing platforms available for commercial and laboratory-developed assays. Moreover, instrument acquisition costs, if any, would need to be spread across many different potential assays to be used on the new platform, in addition to EV CSF PCR. Our study could also not assess the possible impact of multiplex testing for other viral targets in the CSF, such as HSV. Finally, patients with suspected aseptic meningitis and/or meningoencephalitis were not systematically tested by EV CSF PCR at our hospital during the study period. Although it would be difficult to predict physicians' test ordering behavior, one could reasonably expect increased test utilization once an assay with a more useful TAT becomes available. Hence, guidance regarding indications for testing and interpretation of results would be needed to optimize the test's clinical utility and cost-effectiveness.",
