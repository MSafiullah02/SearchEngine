She had a history of breast cancer, but no hypertension, diabetes or obstructive pulmonary disease. She reported no travel to China or possible contact with infected individuals. She had experienced chills and a dry cough 2 weeks previously but had not sought medical advice. A chest x-ray showed multiple patchy shadows in both lungs and parenchymal thickening with bilateral basal alveolar interstitial infiltrates compatible with COVID-19 ( Fig. 1) . A nasopharynx swab sample was taken. Using reverse real-time PCR assay, the laboratory confirmed on 25 March that the patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was immediately admitted to the isolation ward and received supplemental oxygen through a face mask (12 l/min with a 50% Ventimask), achieving an oxygen saturation of 91%. She was also treated with azithromycin (500 mg once daily, orally) and ceftriaxone (2 g once daily, intravenously). Given the serious shortness of breath and hypoxaemia, methylprednisolone (20 mg once daily, intravenously) was administered to reduce lung inflammation. Laboratory test results showed 1.17% lymphocytes (normal range 20-50%), 95.8% neutrophils (normal range 41-70%) and C-reactive protein of 205.6 (normal value <5). Oxygen pressure was 47 mmHg (normal range 83-108) with a PO 2 /FO 2 of 226 (normal value >300) On the second day of hospitalisation, the patient had an episode of tachycardia with an increase in cardiac laboratory markers: troponin I was 5318 ng/l (normal value <6) and CK-MB was 55 \u00b5g/l (normal value <3). The electrocardiogram showed negative T waves and repolarization phase alterations. An echocardiogram was therefore performed and showed alterations in the left ventricle: apical akinetic expansion (apical ballooning) and hypokinesia of the mid-ventricular segments with slightly reduced systolic function (ejection fraction slightly reduced to 48%) (Fig. 2) . The clinical, laboratory and radiological picture was diagnostic for Takotsubo syndrome. Due to the age of the patient, coronary angiography was not possible but treatment with bisoprolol and fondaparinux was started.",

            "text": "Takotsubo syndrome was first described in 1991 by Dote et al [1] in Japan. The Japanese term was taken from the name of a fishing pot with a round bottom and a narrow neck used for trapping octopus. There have been some suggestions regarding the pathogenesis of this syndrome, but the causes remain unknown [2] . [3] . Parvovirus B19 was the most frequent pathogen, at 50%, as also described by Pankuweit et al. [4, 5] . Viral infections can cause degeneration and necrosis of myocytes, myocarditis and congestive heart failure, and are also implicated in the development of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [6] . We describe what may be the first case of Takotsubo syndrome caused by a coronavirus infection. About a quarter of patients with pneumonia develop cardiac complications during hospitalisation, about 90% in the first weeks after diagnosis and more than half within 24 hours. Currently, 19.7% of COVID-19 patients have associated cardiac complications, although Takotsubo syndrome has not been previously described [7] . This virus may damage vascular integrity and cause the myocardial abnormalities observed in Takotsubo syndrome. Some authors have reported cases of Takotsubo syndrome associated with CMV infection: the virus may mediate coronary endothelial dysfunction with consequent increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and transendothelial migration within the vasculature. SARS-CoV-2 may exert a direct toxic action on myocytes; indeed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human cell receptor which is highly expressed in the heart [8] .",

Several mechanisms have been hypothesized as possible causes of this syndrome. In our case, greater myocardial reactivity to sympathetic stimulation (caused indirectly by pneumonia) in the apical region combined with abnormal vascular reactivity (induced directly by the virus) could have determined the onset of the left ventricular dysfunction seen in Takotsubo syndrome. Acute management of this cardiac condition, especially in elderly patients, may be difficult if the diagnosis is late. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 should be considered in patients presenting with Takotsubo syndrome to further investigate the role of viral infections in the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for this syndrome. As patients with cardiac complications during COVID-19 have a higher mortality rate, we believe that early diagnosis of this disease is important in order to improve patient outcome.",
