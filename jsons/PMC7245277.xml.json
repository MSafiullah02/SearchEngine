As per the segregated team model, an attending surgeon paired to a senior resident or fellow would run the outpatient services for 7-days before another pair takes over.

However, a large proportion of our vascular surgery practice involves caring for and treating patients with lower extremity critical limb ischaemia and haemodialysis accesses. Interventions for these group of patients tend to be semi-urgent or urgent, and cannot be deferred. We classified interventions performed for patients who presented with lower extremity critical limb ischaemia, or patients with dysfunctional or failing dialysis accesses as emergency surgery due to their time-sensitive nature. As such, our operative volume in 2020 has mostly remained constant as compared to 2019 due to a high emergency workload (Figure 3\n).",

The amount of aortic-related cases have also decreased as we now tend to postpone patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms who are asymptomatic. Interestingly, the number of major amputations have risen considerably compared to 2019. This is primarily due to a lower threshold in offering either primary major amputation for patients with a low chance of successful limb salvage, such as those who present with severe infection or extensive tissue loss, or early major amputation for patients who have not improved despite maximal revascularization. As such, these patients can be discharged earlier to a subacute facility or directly home to free vital bed space in the hospital.",

Currently, we still selectively perform arteriovenous dialysis access creation only for patients who have two or more of the abovementioned variables.

Instead, patients who are planned for surgery are meticulously screened for symptoms of acute respiratory infections, abnormalities on chest imaging and prior direct contact with a COVID-19 positive individual. If a patient has, or is suspected to have COVID-19 infection but requires immediate life or limb saving surgery such as repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, the surgery would be performed in a designated COVID-19 operating room. This operating room has a negative pressure environment with a dedicated ingress and egress route that segregates it from the rest of the operating theatre complex. Within the operating room, it is compulsory for healthcare workers to don full personal protective equipment consisting of eye protection with either a N95 respirator mask or a powered air-purifying respirator. A protocol for managing COVID-19 patients in the operating room has been published by our instutition25. However, if surgery for a patient suspected to have COVID-19 can be delayed, COVID-19 testing via a nasopharyngeal swab and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction will be performed. If two consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs are negative, the patient can be de-isolated and operated on in the normal operating theatre. Standard personal protective equipment such as a normal surgical mask will suffice when performing surgery for COVID-19 negative patients. At the point of manuscript writing, we have operated on patients who were suspected to have COVID-19, but not on patents who are COVID-19 positive.",

In response to this inevitable paradigm shift in surgical training, we implemented several measures to ensure continued training for our trainees. We curated surgical or procedural videos from the various online sources for our trainees to view. For example, we found that the \u201cHouston Methodist DeBakey CV Education\u201d channel on YouTube contained multiple highly educational surgical videos and didactic lectures that were immensely useful to our trainees. We also encouraged our trainees to listen to the \u201cAudible Bleeding\u201d podcast and participate in the interactive online symposiums organized by Vascupedia.
