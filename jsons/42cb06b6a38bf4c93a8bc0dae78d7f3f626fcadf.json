The molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for glycyrrhizic acid were prepared by using bismethacryloyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and methacrylic acid as double functional monomers and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, thermo gravimetric analysis, nitrogen adsorption and elemental analysis. In aqueous media, the adsorption properties of MIPs including adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms and selectivity adsorption were investigated. The characterization of imprinted polymers indicated that the prepared MIPs had good stability and many cavity structures. The results of adsorption experiments illustrated the MIPs had high adsorption capacity of glycyrrhizic acid (69.3 mg g \u22121 ) with the imprinting factor 3.77, and it took~5 min to get adsorption equilibrium. The MIPs could be used as an solid phase extraction sorbent absorbent for enrichment and purification of glycyrrhizic acid from the crude extraction of licorice roots, and the results showed promising practical value.",

It is reported that glycyrrhizic acid has been used to treat patients with chronic active hepatitis (3) , fight against the human immunodeficiency virus (4) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes coronavirus (5) . Recently, it has been reported that glycyrrhizic acid can ameliorate the intracerebral hemorrhage-induced injury (6, 7) and liver injury (8) induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Glycyrrhizic acid can also be used to inhibit side effects of contraceptive formulations, such as alterations in blood coagulation and thrombosis (9) .",

Among the extraction techniques, molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) is an efficient approach for purification of analytes from complex matrices (15) and it has been used in environmental, food (16) and life science fields (17) because of the easy preparation and excellent recognition properties of MIPs for analytes. Hydrogen bonding, the main effect between MIPs and template molecules, was easily destroyed in aqueous media because aqueous solvents can compete with the template for the functional monomers (18) . And a paper has reported that preparation of glycyrrhizic acid MIPs using Methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomers could not avoid the influence of aqueous solvents (19) . Recently, \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) and its derivatives have been chosen as functional monomers for making MIPs due to the internal hydrophobic external hydrophilic properties (20) . It is reported that the synthesized MIPs were successfully used to separate some biological compounds, such as cholesterol (21, 22) , antibiotics (23) , peptides (24) and other compounds in aqueous solution (25) .",

According to the polarity of the solvent, different washing and eluting solvents were investigated. In the washing step, the column was washed with 1-3 mL of ethanol, ethanol/water (9:1, v/v), ethanol/water (5:5, v/v), methanol, methanol/water (9:1, v/v), water, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile and methylene chloride, respectively, and the flow rate was 2 mL\u00b7min \u22121 . When ethanol/water (9:1, v/v) was used, the loss rate of glycyrrhizic acid was the lowest and the leaching rate of impurities was the highest. So ethanol/water (9:1, v/v) was chosen as washing solution. When the volume of washing solution was increased, the loss of glycyrrhizic acid was gradually increased. So the choice of volume was 1 mL. In order to get the best eluting condition, the column was eluted with 1-6 mL of water, ethanol/ water (5:5, v/v), methanol/water (9:1, v/v), methanol/glacial acetic acid (8:2, v/v) and 0.1% methanol HCl (9:1, v/v), respectively, and the flow rate was 3 mL\u00b7min \u22121 . When using water as eluent, the recovery of glycyrrhizic acid was the highest. So water was chosen as eluent. It was found that the recovery of glycyrrhizic acid increased gradually before 4 mL of eluting solution. And there was no significant different for recovery between 5 and 6 mL, so 5 mL was chosen as the eluent volume.",

This structure enables it to form inclusion compounds with many compounds in aqueous media or organic solvents with high polarity through hydrophobic interactions (28) . In the pre-polymerization mixture for synthesis MIPs, when BMA-\u03b2-CD was mixed with glycyrrhizic acid in DMSO, the aromatic rings of glycyrrhizic acid entrapped inside the hydrophobic core of BMA-\u03b2-CD and the more polar carboxyl group (-COOH) of glycyrrhizic acid left outside the cavity. When MAA was added, the carboxyl group can form hydrogen interactions with MAA. Thus, the BMA-\u03b2-CD molecule and MAA molecule were regularly placed. The positions and mutual conformations of BMA-\u03b2-CD molecule and MAA molecule were fixed by cross-linking procedure.",

While under the same conditions, the adsorbed amount of NIPs increased slowly and the amount of glycyrrhizic acid bound to MIPs was much higher than that of NIPs. It should be noted that the maximum adsorption capacity was 69.3 mg\u00b7g \u22121 , which was much higher than the reported method (7). Adsorption studies indicated that the binding sites of the MIPs prepared were at the surface or in the proximity of the surface. So it is an easy diffusion for target to access the recognition sites. This merit is especially favorable for SPE. The results showed that the polymers had better absorption performance for glycyrrhizic acid, which illustrated the good specificity of MIPs.",
