In this paper, we deal with a more generalized graph structure, called multigraph (multiple edges of different types connecting a pair of nodes) and propose Multigraph2Vec, a random walk based framework for learning multigraph network representation. Multigraph2Vec samples a heterogeneous neighborhood structure for each node by preserving the inter-layer interactions. It employs L\u00e9vy flight random walk strategy, which allows the random walker to travel across multiple layers and reach far-off nodes in a single step. The transition probabilities are learned in a supervised fashion as a function of node attributes (metadata based and/or network structure based). We compare Multigraph2Vec with four state-of-the-art baselines after suitably adopting to our setting on four datasets. Multigraph2Vec outperforms others in the task of link prediction, by beating the best baseline with 5.977% higher AUC score; while in the multi-class node classification task, it beats the best baseline with 5.28% higher accuracy. We also deployed Multigraph2Vec for friend recommendation on Hike Messenger.",

However, most real-world networks are multigraphs as multifaceted relationships are quite common between nodes. This is known as the multiplexity property [23] in social networks. For instance, a pair of users on a social network can be related through friendship, messaging, etc. In a scientific network, researchers can share a link by virtue of being co-authors on a paper or by citing each other's works. A high quality representation of a node in a multigraph should not only capture information about its neighboring nodes but also encode the relationships that exist with its neighbors. Hence, network embedding methods built for homogeneous networks must be extended to characterize the rich context present in multiple types of edges.",

As expected, multilayer embedding methods (Multigraph2Vec, PMNE and MNE) outperform single-layer embedding methods (Node2Vec, LINE). The reason is that multilayer methods can capture the useful multi-relational interactions among nodes, while single-layer networks cannot. MNE turns out to be the best baseline. However, Multigraph2Vec outperforms MNE by 5.53%, 5.73%, 6.66% and 5.21% higher AUC (relative) on EU, Hike, Lazega and Publication datasets, respectively (averaged over the layers). From Fig. 2 it can be seen that when only network attributes are used AUC values are always higher than when either metadata attributes or both metadata and network attributes are used. This is because metadata features are redundant when combined with network properties, Hence together these features are actually losing information instead of gaining one. To support the fact we perform correlation analysis between every metadata and network properties features. We compute both linear (Pearson) as well as non linear (Spearman) coefficient on EU and System dataset because only they had metadata attributes. The mean linear correlation comes out to be 0.82 and 0.92 while the mean non linear correlation is 0.78 and 0.86 respectively on EU and Hike dataset. These values support the fact that network properties along with metadata properties causes redundancy which decreases the AUC-ROC score and hence network attributes alone gives best result.",

It is not necessary that all pairs of nodes are always connected by three different edges.For example, nodes C and E are connected by only friendship link. But they do not follow each other and do not chat. (b) Each edge type mentioned in Fig (a) forms a layer/dimension in the corresponding multidimensional network. Node set remains same across layers, and each layer is homogeneous in terms of the edge type. (c) Illustration of the modified L\u00e9vy flight strategy on a multidimensional network.
