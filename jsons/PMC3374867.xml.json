These papers emphasized the presence of potentially confounding factors in many climate change\u2013disease studies, calling into question whether climate change will, in fact, cause widespread increases in human and wildlife diseases. Moreover, papers published on the absence of disease are scarce relative to those on its presence and, thus, there is likely to be a publication bias against climate preventing disease outbreaks. This controversy surrounding climate change\u2013disease interactions underscores the need for a clearly defined research agenda. Here, we outline key gaps in data, theory and scale that point to the frontiers in climate change\u2013infectious disease research. We hope that this will help resolve this controversy, synthesize knowledge and advance understanding. We emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the problem, encouraging collaborations among epidemiologists, disease ecologists, climatologists, modelers, geographical information system (GIS) specialists, sociologists, economists and policy and management practitioners.",

            "text": "Some of the controversy surrounding the effects of climate change on disease stems from questionable null models that can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, although researchers frequently assume that pathogens will experience range expansions as they move pole-ward, tropical range contractions might also occur [17]. It is presently unclear whether range shifts, contractions, or expansions are most likely and, thus, a neutral hypothesis of no change in the geographic ranges might be the most defensible null expectation 17, 20. Similarly, the need to shift distributions pole-ward or to higher altitudes as the planet warms, coupled with species variation in dispersal abilities, has stimulated the hypothesis that climate change will cause phenological mismatch between parasites and their hosts [21]. Singer and Parmesan [21], however, recently pointed out that evidence in support of this hypothesis is based on the null assumption of perfect synchrony, despite phenological mismatch being common before anthropogenic climate change, at least for some insect\u2013host plant interactions. Clearly, historical baseline data are needed to generate appropriate null models and test climate change\u2013disease hypotheses properly.",

A well-studied example is the effect of temperature on the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, such as malaria. At cooler temperatures (e.g. 20 \u00b0C), an increase in temperature is expected to increase not only biting rates, parasite replication within mosquitoes and mosquito development, but also mosquito mortality, making the net effect of increasing temperatures difficult to determine. Mathematical models provide a powerful tool for integrating these complex interactions, but model validation requires well-designed laboratory experiments (Box 1\n) and field data sets that are long and detailed enough to enable fitting of the relevant parameters.Box 1Improving experimental designs in climate\u2013species interaction researchObservational studies can identify the best climatic predictors of disease-related response variables, but manipulative experiments are crucial for testing whether climatic factors truly have causal relationships with disease. Here, we present some common issues with climate-change experiments and suggest improvements that should enhance the quality of data obtained from future studies.\nIssue: Climate-change researchers commonly treat samples within a single environmental chamber as independent replicates of temperature (e.g. [66]) (i.e. pseudoreplication), which can confound temperature with anything else that might differ among chambers (e.g. light, humidity or air circulation).Improvements:\n\u2022Have true and adequate replication of temperature treatments, for instance by building a large number of independent incubators out of Styrofoam, heat tape and thermostats.\u2022Replicate the effect of temperature in time (i.e. temporal blocks).\u2022Place multiple experimental units within each incubator and analyze the data using appropriately nested mixed-effects models that treat the chamber as the level of replication for testing temperature effects (e.g. [67]). Such analyses require a minimum of four chambers to compare two temperature treatments.\u2022Including more than two levels of temperature and treating temperature as a continuous predictor. This can enable the detection of nonlinearities and is required to provide functional relationships for integrative and/or predictive models [68].\u2022Conduct meta-analyses of independent tests of temperature effects [3].\n\nIssue: In many experiments, all individual organisms are initially held at a single temperature and then a subset are transferred to higher or lower temperatures and experimentally infected with a pathogen. In this design, temperature is confounded with the magnitude of the temperature shift that occurs at the start of the experiment, making it unclear which is driving any observed effect of the temperature treatment.\nImprovement: Adequately acclimate study organisms to the temperature of interest before applying treatments.\nIssue: Field experiments often provide more ecologically relevant data than do laboratory experiments, but it can be challenging to manipulate climate in the field.\nImprovements: use creative ideas for manipulating climate in field experiments.\u2022Heating coils or continuous CO2 input chambers can be used to replicate climate or climate-associated treatments.\u2022Increase temperatures via the greenhouse effect by enclosing small, open-top plots in clear plastic [69].\n",

As another example, effects of El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and climatic variability on disease-related amphibian declines were only revealed after controlling for a multidecadal pattern in extinctions that was probably caused by the spread of the pathogenic chytrid fungus [16].",

For instance, evidence suggests that coupling between cholera dynamics and climate is transient, occurring only during strong ENSO events. This observation is consistent with a threshold response, whereby climate is only an important driver of cholera during climatic extremes [10]. Threshold responses are difficult to capture with standard linear statistical models and challenges associated with stochasticity, finite population sizes, time-lags and covariates present additional obstacles to detecting thresholds [27]. More sophisticated statistical approaches that allow for nonlinearities [32], as well as other techniques, such as scale-dependent correlation analysis [10], the significant zero crossings (SiZer) model [28], or models that allow for flexible treatment of regime shifts [27], might be necessary to detect climatic threshold effects on disease.",

Second, smaller organisms have fewer cells and processes requiring adjustment following temperature shifts and, thus, generally withstand greater temperature extremes than do larger organisms [39]. Finally, owing to their shorter generation times, parasites should evolve more quickly than their hosts to changes in climate. Nevertheless, most research on climate change and disease has neglected evolutionary processes, despite evidence highlighting the importance of evolution in disease processes on ecological timescales [40] and in mitigating against the impacts of climate change [41].",

Because tropical climates are less variable, tropical organisms are adapted to much narrower temperature ranges than are temperate and arctic species and, thus, are expected to be more sensitive to small changes in climate [47]. Additionally, because metabolic rate increases exponentially with temperature, organisms in the warmer tropics experience a greater change in metabolism with each unit increase in temperature than do organisms in temperate and Polar Regions [49]. Indeed, when considering both recent global warming and the exponential relationship between metabolic rate and temperature, Dillon et al.\n[49] estimated that organisms in tropical and northern temperate zones are experiencing the largest absolute increase in metabolic rates and, thus, are being impacted most by climate change.",

First, it is unclear whether parasites will follow the same metabolic \u2018rules\u2019 as free-living organisms. Second, the metabolic approach does not yet explicitly incorporate species interactions, such as parasitism [50], and accounting for these interactions often improves predictions of climate-change impacts [51]. Third, the emphasis of metabolic theory has been on effects of mean temperature, but changes in other climatic components, such as precipitation and climatic variability, also could impact species interactions (Figure 2), especially for parasites with life stages outside the host. Finally, understanding of how abiotic factors influence host immunity remains in its infancy 52, 53, but will probably have an important role in predicting the outcome of host\u2013parasite interactions (e.g. [54]). Until more of these knowledge gaps are filled, it will remain unclear whether climate change will have the biggest impact on host\u2013parasite interactions at mid\u2013high latitudes, in the tropics, or at difficult-to-predict locations scattered throughout the world (Figure 1).

Furthermore, we predict that climate change will cause more extinctions of parasites with complex life-cycles than of those with direct transmission, because there is a greater chance that at least one of their necessary host species will go extinct with climate change. We also expect a greater fraction of human parasites to go extinct in tropical than temperate regions because a higher percentage of tropical human diseases specialize on a vector species (80% tropical versus 13% temperate) and/or a wild animal reservoir (80% tropical versus 20% temperate) [62].",

If, for instance, rare or less pathogenic parasites go extinct more so than abundant or highly virulent parasites, then the impact of parasite extinctions on overall disease incidence and severity might be small. However, the loss of many rare parasite species could be substantial. Furthermore, range shifts could expose hosts to novel parasites, which might lead to more severe disease than in disease-endemic areas. This is a concern for potential climate-induced range shifts of human malaria [26]. In addition, generalist parasites, which might be more likely to persist with climate change (see above), can be more challenging to control because they can be maintained by multiple host species and can therefore persist with higher virulence to a subset of their host species relative to specialist parasites [63]. Increased temperatures might also increase the frequency and intensity of transmission by lengthening the \u2018growing season\u2019 of parasites that survive climate change [6]. However, the same changes might sometimes drive decreases in transmission if host immunity is enhanced at higher temperatures or when temperatures exceed the optimum for parasite transmission. Finally, global warming is generally increasing temperature minima more than maxima and this might be more likely to move temperatures for parasite and vector performance towards their optima than beyond it [64].",

In some host\u2013parasite systems, the most abundant and resilient species are also hosts that amplify transmission, whereas other species might decrease disease risk [59]. In some of these systems, such \u2018amplifying\u2019 hosts increase in abundance as the density of less resilient, \u2018diluting\u2019 hosts decline [59]. If extinctions caused by climate change are biased towards these rarer hosts, as we suggest, and these are indeed disease-diluting hosts, climate change might reduce the disease-buffering capacity of biodiversity and increase prevalence and severity of diseases that persist with climate change 57, 58, 59. However, the relative contributions of individual species to transmission are poorly known for most pathogens and, thus, the significance of any loss in host species remains uncertain.",

Effective forecasting of climate-change impacts on disease will require filling the many gaps in data, theory and scale (Figure 1). Although this review emphasizes the effects of climate change on disease, parasite\u2013host interactions have many parallels with other enemy\u2013victim interactions and, thus, most of the concepts covered here should be relevant to the study of climate-change effects on species interactions in general [50]. Similarly, important discoveries of climate-change effects on non-parasitic interactions could inform predictions for climate-change effects on disease [50] and short-term retrospective and paleontological investigations should also prove to be informative [30]. Although there should be genuine concern regarding future disease risk for humans and wildlife, we discourage alarmist claims and encourage rigor, open-mindedness and broad thinking regarding this crucial and interdisciplinary global issue.",
