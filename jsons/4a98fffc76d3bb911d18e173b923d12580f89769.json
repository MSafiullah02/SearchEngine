We observe a large dependency of the epidemic's dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODEmodels. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.",

Given the lack of a vaccine, the international community relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing, mandatory quarantines, or border closures. Such intervention strategies, however, inflict high costs on society. Hence, for political decision-making it is crucial to forecast the spreading dynamics and to estimate the effectiveness of different interventions.",

A wellestablished way to model such structures is to simulate the spreading on a network structure that represents the individuals of a population and their social contacts. Effects of the network structure are largely related to the epidemic threshold which describes the minimal infection rate needed for a pathogen to be able to spread over a network [37] . In the network-free paradigm the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which describes the (mean) number of susceptible individuals infected by patient zero, determines the evolution of the spreading process. The value R 0 depends on both, the connectivity of the society and the infectiousness of the pathogen. In contrast, in the network-based paradigm the interaction structure (given by the network) and the infectiousness (given by the infection rate) are decoupled.",

We calibrate both, ODE-models and stochastic models with interaction structure to the same basic reproduction number R 0 or to the same infection peak and compare the corresponding results. In particular, we analyze the changes in the effective reproduction number over time. For instance, early exposure of superspreaders leads to a sharp increase of the reproduction number, which results in a strong increase of infected individuals. We compare the times at which the number of infected individuals is maximal for different network structures as well as the death toll. Our results show that the interaction structure has a major impact on the spreading dynamics and, in particular, important characteristic values deviate strongly from those of the ODE model.",

Currently for COVID-19, inferred data seems to be of very poor quality [24] . However, while the spreading parameters are subject to a broad scientific discussion, publicly available data, which could be used for inferring a realistic contact network, practically does not exist. Therefore real-world data on contact networks are rare [30, 45, 23, 32, 43] and not available for large-scale populations. A reasonable approach is to generate the data synthetically, for instance by using mobility and population data based on geographical diffusion [46, 17, 36, 3] . For instance, this has been applied to the influenza virus [33] . Due to the major challenge of inferring a realistic contact network, most of these works, however, focus on how specific network features shape the spreading dynamics.",

At each point in time, each node occupies a compartment, for instance: S, I, or R. Moreover, nodes can only receive or transmit infections from neighboring nodes (according to the edges of the graph). For the general case with m possible compartments, this yields a state space of size m n , where n is the number of nodes. The jump times until events happen are typically assumed to follow an exponential distribution. Note that in the ODE model, residual residence times in the compartments are not tracked, which naturally corresponds to the exponential distribution in the network model. Hence, the underlying stochastic process is a continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) [26] . The extension to non-Markovian semantics is trivial. We illustrate the three-compartment case in Fig. 1 . The transition rates of the CTMC are such that an infected node transmits infections at rate \u03bb. Hence, the rate at which a susceptible node is infected is \u03bb\u00b7#Neigh(I), where #Neigh(I) is the number of its infected direct neighbours.

The infectiousness \u03bb (i.e. the infection rate) is assumed to be a parameter expressing how contagious a pathogen inherently is. It encodes the probability of a virus transmission if two people meet. That is, it is independent from the social interactions of individuals (it might however depend on hygiene, masks, etc.). The influence of social contacts is expressed in the (potentially time-varying) connectivity of the graph. Loosely speaking, it encodes the possibility that two individuals meet. In the ODE-approach both are combined in the basic reproduction number. Note that, throughout this manuscript, we use \u03bb to denote the infectiousness of COVID-19 (as an instantaneous transmission rate).",

This indicates that the epidemic slowly \"burns\" through the network. In contrast, in networks that admit super-spreaders (CM-PL, HH, and also BA), it is principally possible for R t to increase. For the CM-PL network, we have a very early and intense peak of the infection while the number of individuals ultimately affected by the virus (and consequently the death toll) remains comparably small (when we remove the super-spreaders from the network while keeping the same R 0 , the death toll and the time point of the peak increase, plot not shown). Note that the high value of R t in Fig. 6 c) in the first days results from the fact that super-spreaders become exposed, which later infect a large number of individuals. As there are very few super-spreaders, they are unlikely to be part of the seeds. However, due to their high centrality, they are likely to be one of the first exposed nodes, leading to an \"explosion\" of the epidemic. In HH-networks this effect is way more subtle but follows the same principle. Experiment 2: Calibrating R 0 to a Fixed Peak. Next, we calibrate \u03bb such that each network admits an infection peak (regarding I total ) of the same height (0.2). Results are shown in Fig. 7 . They emphasize that there is no direct relationship between the number of individuals affected by the epidemic and the height of the infection peak, which is particularly relevant in the light of limited ICU capacities. It also shows that vastly different infection rates and basic reproduction numbers are acceptable when aiming at keeping the peak below a certain threshold.",

The networks types highlight different potential features of real-world social networks. Most results do not contradict line with real-world observations. For instance, we found that better hygiene and the truncation of super-spreaders will likely reduce the peak of an epidemic by a large amount. We also observed that, even when R 0 is fixed, the evolution of R t largely depends on the network structure. For certain networks, in particular those admitting super-spreaders, it can even increase. An increasing reproduction number can be seen in many countries, for instance in Germany [20] . How much of this can be attributed to super-spreaders is still being researched. Note that superspreaders do not necessarily have to correspond to certain individuals. It can also, on a more abstract level, refer to a type of events. We also observed that CM-PL networks have a very early and very intense infection peak. However, the number of people ultimately affected (and therefore also the death toll) remain comparably small. This is somewhat surprising and requires further research.
