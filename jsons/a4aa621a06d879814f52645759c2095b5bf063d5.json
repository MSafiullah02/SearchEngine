Methods: Tonsillar tissue from patients with OSA and RI was subjected to multiplex quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (mqRTPCR), analyzed for the presence of common respiratory viruses' genetic material. Results: Fifty-six patients were included, of whom 34 had OSA (age (years AE S.D), 4.22 AE 1.14) and 22 with RI (4.35 AE 1.36). Respiratory viruses nucleic acids (24 detections) were observed in 17 (50%) OSA samples. In contrast, no virus was detected in RI samples (relative frequency P < 0.0001). Viruses detected, based on frequency were Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and corona virus.

While there are investigators who do not relate the size of the tonsil to the severity of OSA in children, 4 the size of the lymphoid tissue in the upper airway of children with OSA(measured by X-ray or by MRI) seems to correlate with PSG defined OSA severity according to well-designed studies. 5, 6 A far as we know, in snoring children, considerable pharyngeal lymphoid tissue enlargement is present since the preschool years and persists during school years. 7 Neurogenic inflammation is a name termed to describe an inflammatory process that is activated and perpetuated following a viral infection, by neurons located in proximity to airways. 8 An animal model that was developed to study the association of RSV infection with childhood asthma revealed neurogenic inflammation. The investigators discovered that RSV infected animals had increased levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for substance P (SP) receptor (neurokinin 1 [NK1]) in peribronchial lymphoid tissue. 9 In addition, nerve growth factor (NGF), a known modulator of immune and inflammatory responses and a key regulatory element of neuronal responsiveness, and its tyrosine receptor kinase (trk-A), are found in increased levels after RSV inoculation. 9 We have shown that in comparison to patients with RI, OSA tonsils overexpress NK1 as well as NGF, in similar to the animal model. 10 Indeed, neurogenic inflammation is known as one of the important mechanisms linking viral infection exposure, like RSV in infancy to chronic inflammatory conditions, like early childhood asthma. 11 RSV is the major cause of bronchiolitis in children <1 year of age and is the most important respiratory tract pathogen during early childhood, infecting nearly all children by the age of 2 years. 12 Interestingly, Children who had proven RSV bronchiolitis as infants had significantly higher obstructive apnea/hypopnea index compared to controls, in an overnight sleep study, suggesting a role for early life viral insult, in the pathogenesis of OSA. 13 We therefore hypothesized that that RSV and other common respiratory viruses' genomic material are present in tonsils of children with OSA. We speculated that its presence may underlie the aforementioned inflammatory changes 10 and the evolution of lymphoid tissue hypertrophy in children with OSA. In this study, we investigated the presence of viral nucleic acids long after the acute infection. Therefore the objectives of our study were to detect respiratory viruses' genome in the upper airway lymphoid tissue of children operated due to tonsillar hypertrophy, and to compare the presence of viral genomic material between those with and those without OSA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 108, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 210, "end": 212, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 213, "end": 214, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 503, "end": 504, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 692, "end": 694, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 695, "end": 696, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 859, "end": 860, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1046, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1375, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1624, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1757, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1955, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2155, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2408, "end": 2410, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "The Soroka University Medical Center Ethics Committee approved this study.

Leukotrienes and their receptors for example, are more abundant in pediatric tonsillar tissue in the OSA group. 19, 27 Interestingly, leukotriene modifier therapy improves both upper airway patency and severity of sleep disordered breathing. 19, 26 In this respect, leukotrienes mediate neurogenic inflammation in lungs of young rats, following their infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 11 Other studies showed an over expression of steroid alpha receptors (as opposed to beta receptors). 28 This biological feature is associated with an increased responsiveness to steroids, a pediatric common antiinflammatory agent. It is also known, that a number of viruses may cause persistent tonsillar infection. 29, 30 Considering the aforementioned data, we decided to expand our search to the most common respiratory viruses that trigger early infancy and early childhood upper and lower respiratory infections. The additional viruses included RSV, Adenovirus, as well as the hPMV whose importance is being recognized among pediatricians in light of the clinical spectrum of disease it causes, 31 and the clinical similarity to RSV. Another newly included virus was Rhinovirus. Several publications by leading research centers unfold that the pathogen known particularly as the commonest cause of common cold, is the most significant predictor of the subsequent development of asthma at age 6 years compared to other respiratory viruses. [32] [33] [34] Recently, investigators in Brazil reported on viral nucleic acid detections in children with adenotonsillar disease. 35 They examined tonsils that were removed due to several indications. Apparently, in only 11(9%) of them the diagnosis of OSA was confirmed (no details regarding PSG formal diagnosis were mentioned). The lowest rate of virus detection was found in tonsils (68%, similar to our 50%), followed by nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoids. Furthermore, in 20.7%, viral co-infections were detected in palatine tonsils, similar to our findings (29%). In similar to our findings they also found adeno, rhino and hMPV to be the most prevalent viruses in tonsils, with the exception of enterovirus (that wasn't on our RTPCR panel). Although they detected viral nucleic acids in many of their patients, it is hard to compare their findings to ours, mainly because of the uncertainty of OSA diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 191, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 416, "end": 418, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 568, "end": 570, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 734, "end": 737, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 738, "end": 740, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 822, "end": 825, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 826, "end": 828, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 968, "end": 970, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1237, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1240, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1367, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1370, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1525, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1627, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1843, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1846, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2224, "end": 2226, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2572, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2573, "end": 2577, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2582, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2702, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The RTPCR results indicate clear tendency of respiratory viruses to remain for an extended period of time in the lymphoid tissue of patients with OSA, but not at the age and sex matching group without OSA, whose lymphoid tissue proliferation mechanisms are conceivably the result of other mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Histological studies of enlarged tonsils, revealed follicular enlargement, suggesting hyperplasia with a substantial increase in lymphoid cells within germinal centers. 36 It is also conceivable that some respiratory viruses may directly affect tonsil cell survival, by countering apoptosis.
