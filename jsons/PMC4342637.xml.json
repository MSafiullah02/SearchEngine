The number of confirmed cases in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, was the largest [2]. Most H7N9 patients had reported recent exposure to live poultry [1]. Clinical symptoms at the onset of the illness include a high fever (\u226538\u00b0C) and a cough. As the disease progressed, patients could develop dyspnea or severe progressive pneumonia, and could rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome [2-4].",

There was limited knowledge available about H7N9 when it struck, which raised many public health concerns globally [5]. To prevent and control H7N9, the Zhejiang Province Government implemented a series of interventions, including increasing the emergency response level and closing live poultry markets. During the outbreak of H7N9, the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used different means to conduct health education to encourage the public to take preventive behaviors. For example, the Zhejiang CDC published a booklet titled \u201cCommon Respiratory Infectious Diseases Booklet.\u201d The printed booklets were given away in communities and the electronic version was uploaded to the Zhejiang CDC\u2019s website for downloading. The Zhejiang CDC made full use of major media outlets, such as Zhejiang Daily and Zhejiang Television, and they also set up a 24-hour hotline. In addition, the Zhejiang CDC used 2 accounts, named China Health Education and Zhejiang Health Education, on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese microblog, to disseminate information about behaviors to prevent respiratory communicable diseases.",

Quick-spreading rumors of the outbreak of H7N9 were found in most provinces in China. Previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has demonstrated the importance of monitoring public perception of epidemic control, which may affect the public\u2019s compliance to advocated precautionary behaviors. Elucidation of factors that may affect precautionary behaviors, such as knowledge and risk perception of the disease, may also help to prevent the spread of infection. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive correlation between perceived infectiousness and the willingness to adhere to recommended behaviors that prevent and control infection [7,8]. Therefore, it is important to assess the public\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding H7N9 [9]. Specifically, this study evaluated KAP among mobile phone users in Zhejiang Province. Findings of the current study can provide information about the effectiveness of the Zhejiang CDC\u2019s health education efforts as well as how to design evidence-based interventions to reduce the risks of contracting H7N9 among the public.",

Regarding the attitude recommended by the Zhejiang CDC, participants stated whether they believed it was safe to eat cooked poultry and what they would do if they had a fever and/or a cough. Then participants answered questions about their adoption of 2 preventive practices recommended by the Zhejiang CDC, which were avoiding crowds and increasing the frequency of hand washing. Finally, participants answered sociodemographic questions about age, gender, occupation, and education.

We conducted both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to investigate the associations between sociodemographic variables and KAP variables. The univariate analyses revealed the unadjusted effect of a sociodemographic variable without controlling for other sociodemographic variables. The multivariate analyses revealed the adjusted effect of a sociodemographic variable after holding other sociodemographic variables constant. Forward-selection technique was employed for model selection. We dummy-coded categorical variables. For questions about knowledge of symptoms of H7N9, knowledge of its transmission routes, attitude toward eating cooked poultry, and practice of avoiding crowds, answers of \u201cyes\u201d were coded into the high-KAP category indicating high levels of KAP; answers of \u201cno\u201d and \u201cunclear\u201d were coded into the low-KAP category indicating low levels of KAP.

For the question about recent consumption of cooked poultry, answers indicating consumption as usual were coded into 1 category and answers indicating decreased or no consumption were coded into another category. For the question about frequency of hand washing, answers indicating increased frequency were coded into the high-KAP category and answers indicating unchanged frequency or unclearness were coded into the low-KAP category.

Our data indicated that sociodemographic variables were significantly associated with KAP. For example, female participants were more likely to know about symptoms of H7N9, to worry about it, and to report their lives being influenced by it. They were also more likely to take the recommended precautionary practices, such as avoiding crowds and washing hands more frequently, to prevent H7N9 infection. The findings were consistent with the literature, which indicated greater likelihood for females than males to perceive higher levels of risk of contracting contagious diseases [18,19], and to take precautionary measures to prevent getting such diseases [20]. The findings implied a plausible relationship between knowledge and the adoption of preventive practices, as suggested in the literature [21,22], among females. Therefore, enhancing knowledge about a new infectious disease can be an effective strategy to encourage the adoption of preventive measures. The findings also implied a plausible association between risk perception and the adoption of preventive practices among females. This may also apply to participants with occupations related to poultry industry. Specifically, participants with occupations related to the poultry industry were more likely to worry about contracting H7N9 and to report their lives being influenced by H7N9. They were also more likely to take precautionary practices. These results suggest the behavioral effect of risk perception. However, increased worry and concern did not seem to elicit behavioral change among young people or among participants with less education. Young participants aged 15-24 years were more likely to worry about contracting H7N9, but were less likely to comply with advocated protective measures. Education affected attitude toward H7N9; participants with primary education or lower tended to worry about contracting H7N9 and feel that their lives were being affected.
