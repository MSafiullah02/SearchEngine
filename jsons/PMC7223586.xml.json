Moreover, novel IAV strains have emerged repeatedly in the past, leading to a large number of deaths by pandemics in the twentieth century (Frederick 1958; Saunders and Krewski 2016; World Health Organization 2009). To combat IAV, there is a relentless need to develop more effective antiviral therapies and vaccine strategies.",

Hibiscus tea contains abundant bioactive compounds including anthocyanins, polyphenols, organic acids, and flavonoids (Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014). Earlier reports have shown various biological and pharmacological activities of hibiscus tea and hibiscus tea-derived compounds like anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cholesterol, anti-hypertensive, anti-bacterial, and antiviral activities (D\u2019Souza et al. 2016; Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014; Hassan et al. 2017; Joshi et al. 2015). We previously reported the antiviral activity of hibiscus tea extract against H5 subtype avian influenza viruses (Baatartsogt et al. 2016). Hibiscus tea extract inactivated the avian influenza viruses, showing activity in 10 min. Based on these results, we hypothesized that these potent and rapid antiviral activities could be used to develop a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for the whole inactivated vaccine.",

Although these drugs elicit the therapeutic effect, viral strains resistant against these drugs tend to appear after prolonged use (Hurt 2014; Li et al. 2015), and some of these drugs also exhibit adverse effects. RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir showed teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animal experiments. Therefore, its clinical use is strictly restricted in Japan (Nagata et al. 2015). In addition, the possibility of insufficient existing drug supply is a concern during pandemics. Finding novel anti-IAV substances would be a promising approach for treatment to deal with these problems.",

Whole inactivated vaccine can prime potent protective immunity because it preserves virus particle integrity (Soema et al. 2015). In addition, i.n. vaccination can induce systemic IgG production and mucosal IgA production, the latter of which is indispensable to prevent viral infection establishment (Rose et al. 2012; Tamura et al. 2016). Formalin and \u03b2-propiolactone (\u03b2-PL) are widely used as inactivating agents for whole-virus vaccines (Delrue et al. 2012). However, removal of these substances is essential due to their chemical toxicity, making the procedure time consuming and expensive. Finding a safe anti-IAV compound that can be used as a novel inactivating agent for a whole-virus vaccine may solve critical problems.",

PR8 virus was mixed with non-pH-adjusted and pH-adjusted PBS or Hib[crude] (pH of the mixture ranged from 3.0 to 7.2), and the titer of the treated virus was determined. The pH of the mixture containing non-pH-adjusted Hib[crude] was around 3.0. After a 10-min reaction, Hib[crude] and PBS of pH \u2264 4.0 strongly inactivated the PR8 virus, but the effect of Hib[crude] at pH 4.0 seemed to be slightly higher than PBS at pH 4.0. On the other hand, both PBS and Hib[crude] of pH \u2265 5.0 did not inactivate PR8 virus. After a 24-h reaction, PR8 virus was inactivated using both PBS and Hib[crude] at pH \u2264 5. On the other hand, the viral titer of Hib[crude]-treated PR8 virus was 101-times lower than PBS-treated PR8 virus under the conditions of pH \u2265 6.0 (Fig. 1a). The differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05 or 0.01). We also evaluated viral titers of acidic and neutral (pH-adjusted) frHibis-treated PR8 virus. The pH of the mixture containing non-pH-adjusted frHibis was around 3.0. Acidic frHibis inactivated PR8 virus after a 10-min reaction, but neutral frHibis did not. After a 48-h reaction, the viral titer of neutral frHibis-treated PR8 virus was consistent with neutral Hib[crude]-treated PR8 virus and 102-times lower (p < 0.01) than PBS-treated PR8 virus (Fig. 1b). These results show that frHibis has two different anti-PR8 virus activities: one is a rapid and potent activity largely dependent on acid, and the other is a slow and weak low-pH-independent activity.",

Non-vaccinated mice receiving PBS served as a control group. Non-vaccinated mice rapidly lost body weight after the viral inoculation, and all mice in the group died by day 7. On the other hand, the body weight in the formalin- and \u03b2-PL-treated groups did not change, and all the mice survived until day 14. The mice lost body weight in the Hib[crude]-treated group, but the degree of weight loss was ameliorated compared to the non-vaccinated group. The vaccine efficacy was much lower in the Hib[crude]-treated group, but the survival rate was significantly improved (Fig. 5b, c). The HI-active Ab titer in serum was also measured pre-inoculation on day 0 and post-inoculation on day 14. Prior to inoculation, the HI titers were below the detection limit in all non-vaccinated mice, but the titers were in the range of 29 to 212 in the formalin and \u03b2-PL groups. In the Hib[crude] group, the titers were less than 25 in all mice and below the detection limit in two mice (Fig. 5d). Although the HI titers were low in the Hib[crude] group, the HI-positive mice survived until day 14 (data not shown). Post-inoculation HI titer did not differ from the pre-inoculation titer in the formalin and \u03b2-PL groups. In the Hib[crude] group, the HI titer increased to the same level as the formalin and \u03b2-PL groups (Fig. 5d). These results indicate that formalin- and \u03b2-PL-inactivated vaccine completely prevented viral infection, but acidic Hib[crude]-inactivated vaccine did not prevent infection. The viral particle structure integrity in the whole inactivated vaccine relates to protective activity against IAV infection. We assessed whether the conformation of hemagglutinin (HAin) was preserved in each vaccine using the HA assay. HA activity of IAV is lost by a change in HAin conformation (Sriwilaijaroen and Suzuki 2012). Intact (untreated) or inactivated PR8 virus was mixed with chicken blood cells and the HA titer was measured. The HA titer of acidic Hib[crude]-treated PR8 virus was below the detection limit, but the HA titer of formalin- and \u03b2-PL-treated PR8 virus was similar to the intact PR8 virus (Fig. 5e). These results show that formalin and \u03b2-PL treatments but not acidic Hib[crude] preserve HAin conformation.",

            "text": "Earlier studies indicated that the extract derived from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. calyces has antiviral activity against the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, herpes simplex virus-2, feline calicivirus, murine norovirus-1, hepatitis A virus, and Aichi virus (Baatartsogt et al. 2016; D\u2019Souza et al. 2016; Hassan et al. 2017; Joshi et al. 2015). Moreover, the leaves of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. also showed anti-measles virus activity (Sunday et al. 2010). However, antiviral activity mechanism against these viruses is still unclear. Since many acidic compounds in hibiscus calyces contribute to the low pH, we focused on correlating anti-PR8 viral activity and the acidic pH of hibiscus tea components. We found that not only Hib[crude] but also PBS of pH \u2264 4.0 potently inactivated PR8 virus in a short period of time (10 min) (Fig. 1). This finding indicates that the anti-PR8 virus activity of hibiscus tea extract is largely dependent on acid. However, we could not deny a possibility that there are unknown antiviral compounds which show its activity only in the acidic condition. This unknown mechanism might partially contribute to the viral inactivation. We further analyzed the anti-PR8 virus activity of PCA, ferulic acid, and hibiscus acid, which are all components of hibiscus tea extract. In the previous reports, PCA showed antiviral activity against feline calicivirus, murine norovirus-1, and herpes simplex virus-2 (Hassan et al. 2017; Joshi et al. 2015). Ferulic acid showed antiviral activity against feline calicivirus and murine norovirus-1 (Joshi et al. 2015). Here, acidic PCA and hibiscus acid showed anti-PR8 virus activity. Non-pH-adjusted ferulic acid solution with a relatively higher pH (pH 6.5) did not inactivate PR8 virus. When the IAV particle is exposed to acidic pH conditions, viral HAin changes its conformation and irreversibly loses binding affinity for sialic acid (Quan et al. 2011; Sriwilaijaroen and Suzuki 2012). Here, all PR8 virus particles treated with acidic PBS-, Hib[crude], frHibis, or PCA lost their HA activity (Fig. 3). It is also known that low-pH treatment of IAV induces M1 protein layer loss and coagulation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (Fontana et al. 2012). These comprehensive structural changes due to acid could have resulted in rapid and potent viral inactivation from acidic hibiscus component treatment. Many IAV strains are susceptible to acid, but the degree of sensitivity varies between strains (Puri et al. 1990; Ruigrok et al. 1984). Some highly pathogenic strains of avian H5 influenza virus like H5N1 strain isolated from Thailand were resistant to pH 3.0 (treated for 10 min at room temperature) treatment (Wanaratana et al. 2010). Although acidic Hib[crude] and frHibis inactivated highly pathogenic and low-pathogenic avian H5 influenza viruses in 10 min in our previous study (Baatartsogt et al. 2016), we have yet to determine whether all potent and rapid antiviral activity against these H5 viral strains is completely acid dependent.",

The neutral PCA also showed anti-PR8 virus activity (Fig. 2). The anti-PR8 virus activity by both neutral frHibis and PCA did not affect HAin activity (Fig. 3). Since PCA accounts for 24% of Hibiscus sabdariffa water extract (Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014), a major part of the anti-PR8 virus activities of neutral hibiscus extract may be due to PCA. In addition, frHibis also contains abundant bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds (Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014). Several studies reported that polyphenol-rich plant extracts and plant-derived phenolic compounds have anti-IAV activities (Droebner et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013; Yamada et al. 2009). These phenolic compounds in frHibis may also contribute to antiviral activity. An attempt to identify the mechanism of low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus activity of PCA and to search for other low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus constituents is currently ongoing.",

In the case of p.o. administration, Hib[crude] is first absorbed from the digestive tract and distributed into systemic blood. Subsequently, it reaches the respiratory organs where IAV resides. The neutralized Hib[crude] in the blood loses potent anti-IAV activity due to acid, and the low-pH-independent antiviral activity is inadequate to inactivate virus in vivo. The low content, weak antiviral activity, and short biological half-life of low-pH-independent anti-IAV compounds in Hib[crude] could contribute to therapeutic failure. To achieve a successful p.o. administration therapy using hibiscus tea components such as PCA, it would be necessary to chemically modify them to extend their biological half-life and enhance antiviral activity or use them in combination with a carrier to retain them in blood.",

We previously showed that i.n. co-administration of innate immune receptor adjuvants with split vaccine efficiently induced both systemic and mucosal anti-IAV immunity (Takaki et al. 2018, 2017; Takeda et al. 2018). On the other hand, whole inactivated vaccine comprises viral structural components with immune priming activity like immunostimulatory viral RNA. We assessed the utility of acidic Hib[crude] as a safe inactivating agent for whole-virus vaccine. However, unlike the viruses inactivated by formalin and \u03b2-PL, the viruses inactivated by acidic Hib[crude] failed to induce efficient protective immunity (Fig. 5). As shown in other reports (Pawar et al. 2015), formalin- and \u03b2-PL-treated virus but not acidic Hib[crude] showed intact HA activity (Fig. 5e). HAin is an immunodominant protein (Kaminski and Lee 2011; Liu et al. 2018; Sautto et al. 2018). The acidic pH of Hib[crude] could cause the loss of antigenicity by inducing a change in HAin conformation. These results show that the acidic hibiscus components cannot be used as inactivating agents for vaccine preparation. On the other hand, low-pH-independent activity of frHibis and PCA which does not affect HAin conformation is suitable for vaccine application. However, these weak virucidal effects have not yet been sufficient for use as an inactivating agent. Further study of the low-pH-independent anti-IAV mechanism and enhancement of its antiviral activity may contribute to IAV vaccine strategy development.",

However, frHibis and PCA were found to have weak low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus activity, which does not affect HAin conformation. Hence, further study of low-pH-independent antiviral compounds may enable us to establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.",
