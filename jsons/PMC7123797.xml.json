Nonetheless, standard PCR is only designed for positive recognition of the amplicons. Post-PCR analysis should be performed in order to characterize both the size and sequence of the product. A DNA gel electrophoresis to measure the size and the quantity of the amplicon is simple and inexpensive. However, it is not easy to discriminate among different amplicons having similar size by gel. Also, gel is not accurate enough to assess the starting target by visualizing the final PCR product with nucleic acid intercalating dyes, although, to some extent, more initial target leads to more PCR product. This can be explained by studying the kinetics of PCR [3].",

At the beginning, all the reagents are sufficient to guarantee good PCR efficiency, and amplification occurs in an exponential manner, with the initial DNA doubling after every cycle. As the cycles progress and reagents are consumed, the reaction starts to slow down. At this point, the PCR product is no longer doubled in every cycle, and nonexponential amplification dominates. Finally, after another several rounds of amplification, the PCR reaction no longer generates templates as a result of the lack of critical components in the reaction. This is commonly known as the plateau phase, or end point, of the PCR reaction [4]. In this sense, the final yield of PCR product is not primarily dependent on the target sequence in the sample.",

This works universally for all dsDNA. Thus real-time PCR that utilizes SG I as reporter [5] is the most straightforward method by eliminating the complicated design of specific probes and reducing the cost of both time and money. As the PCR proceeds, more amplicons accumulate; accordingly, more SG I molecules are bound. The change in fluorescence can then be monitored using a thermocycler equipped with fluorescence detector. In other words, the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the amount of PCR products.\n",

Optimization of primers and template is therefore essential. First, the primers should be designed to generate amplicons with a suitable length (normally, 100\u2013400 bp). Second, the concentration of primers should not be too high in order to achieve a high ratio of specific amplification versus primer-dimer signal. Third, the template should not include complicated secondary structures because this would contribute to the fluorescence signal. After real-time PCR is finished, a melting curve is usually recorded. If PCR generates a homogeneous sequence, only one transition point should be observed. Otherwise, nonspecific products or contaminants may exist. Most commonly, SG I is used for assays for which probe chemistry cannot be used or those assays which do not require high accuracy. SG I can also be used for optimization of primers prior to ordering the sequence-specific probe.",

This DNA is complementary to the sequence within the template. Since the DNA is usually 20\u201330 bases in length, FRET is efficient when the probe is in free form. At this time, the fluorescence is quenched. It is only after the probe hybridizes to the template and is digested by Taq DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase is known to have 5\u2032-exonuclease activity), as it extends the amplification primers, that the linkage between dye and quencher is cleaved, subsequently restoring fluorescence of the dye molecule (Fig. 3.2). Similar to SG I, the fluorescence increases in proportion to the amount of PCR products, since more probes will hybridize and will be cleaved. The advantages of the TaqMan probe include (1) analysis in real time without the need for post-PCR handling, thus reducing labor and cost; (2) specific hybridization-based detection, which eliminates nonspecific signal; and (3) labeling with different dyes with monitoring of different sequence amplifications in one tube. At the same time, however, TaqMan probes have some challenges, including (1) limited use in different assays and (2) limited design parameters. Normally, the probe should be designed close to the 5\u2032 end to give a quick response. The length should be controlled in order to achieve sufficient FRET efficiency. In addition, guanine should not be placed next to the fluorescent dye since it is also an effective quencher. \n",

            "text": "The molecular beacons are the ideal hybridization-based probe for short oligonucleotide detection, and, thus, it is a suitable probe for real-time PCR [11]. In real-time PCR, MB hybridizes with template DNA at the annealing step and produces the fluorescent signal directly. Therefore, it does not need a polymerase with exonuclease activity, which is essential for the TaqMan probe. In the extension step, the polymerase will extend the sequence and displace the MB, returning it to the stem-loop conformation. In this case, the probe can be reused in the remaining cycles. MBs should be designed to hybridize 7\u201310 \u00b0C higher than primers, to ensure detection before primers are extended. Therefore, the stem should be just short enough to guarantee full hybridization, but not so short that can refold to the stem-loop structure after displacement of the molecular beacon by primer extension. Despite the difficulty in designing and optimizing a suitable MB, MB real-time PCR assays are simple, fast, sensitive, and accurate, allowing a high-throughput format and enabling the multiplexing detection in one tube using different labeling probes. MB-based PCR technique has been widely used in SNP analysis, real-time nucleic acid detection and quantitation, allele discrimination, and other clinical assays.",

            "text": "The Scorpion probe is similar to molecular beacons in that it consists of a stem-loop structure when it is in free form. However, the Scorpion incorporates a primer into the sequence at the 3\u2032 end, next to the quencher, via a blocker [12]. This blocker is a non-amplified monomer, which prevents the PCR from reading through the probe. In the extension stage, the polymerase binds the primer and synthesizes the complementary strand of target sequence just as it works in regular PCR. During the annealing step in next cycle, the loop will hybridize to the complementary strand within the same DNA. This separates the fluorophore and quencher, and an enhanced fluorescent signal is instantaneously observed (Fig. 3.4). Because the probe and primer are in the same molecule, the reaction kinetics is extremely fast. Also, intramolecular interaction is more favorable than intermolecular hybridization. This enables the Scorpion probe to provide a higher signal than other bimolecular systems, including either TaqMan or MB, but the design of the Scorpion is more difficult. Specifically, it reduces flexibility in probe design where the loop should be engineered such that it is not too far from the complementary part to ensure high hybridization efficiency. Similarly, the stem should be long enough to stabilize the hairpin structure. The stem\u2019s Tm should be 5\u201310 \u00b0C higher than that of the primer-target hybrid. \n",

Therefore, highly specific, simple, and accessible methods are needed for high-throughput SNPs detection (Fig. 3.5). MB-based assays provide a solution for screening SNPs in homogeneous assays [14]. Most of these assays require PCR to gain enough DNA targets, while MBs can specifically recognize these targets and present detectable signals in real time. Although other probes can also be used in real-time PCR, MBs have been demonstrated to be superior to them in certain aspects. For example, MBs have been proven to have better specificity than TaqMan probe in a detailed research report [15], and MBs have less complexity than Scorpion probe in design.

            "text": "Since organic dyes often overlap each other in their emission spectra, 3\u20134 different dyes are the maximum that can be used at the same time. Another limitation comes from the instrument. Traditional thermal cyclers often have fixed excitation/emission filters. Under this condition, two dyes, which can be separate on a fluorometer, might not be able to be distinguished in PCR assays due to the lack of appropriate filters. Tyagi et al. proposed the construction of wavelength-shift MB [18], which emitted different fluorescent colors, but was excited with monochromatic light. This was realized by attaching a second fluorophore next to the fluorophore of a normal MB, which still contains a nonfluorescent quencher. In this design, one dye served as a harvester with strong absorption in the range of the light source. The other dye accepted the emission transferred from the harvester and emitted the desired color of fluorescence. This shift in emission spectrum is due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the harvester fluorophore to the emitter fluorophore. This only happened in opened probes that are bound to targets, and quencher has been separated from the fluorophores. By this method, the multiplex genetic analysis can be improved to be more simple and reliable.",

            "text": "Current techniques used to identify microbial pathogens usually rely on culturing and screening the samples to monitor the presence of pathogenic organisms, which are already well established. However, these suffer from a number of drawbacks. The assays are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive and require labile natural products [19]. More importantly, these routine tests do not directly characterize virulence factors. Efforts to overcome these problems in pathogenic detection have led to the development of DNA-based diagnosis. Today, culture-based methods for pathogen detection are rapidly being replaced by faster and more specific real-time PCR assays that discriminate different microorganisms based on a signal from specific nucleic acid sequences. Real-time PCR pathogen detection assays amplify target nucleic acid sequences from select microbes present in samples collected from complex biological environments. Specific amplification of target sequences is achieved by custom-designed primers and probes.",

Therefore, the detection of specific microorganisms requires the selection of an optimum target sequence to amplify.

Based on the capacity to distinguish perfect match target from false targets, MBs are naturally suited for SNPs and mutation detection. Similarly, MBs can be used to detect all kinds of pathogens, which may only differ by a few bases in the gene sequences. With the increasing use of real-time PCR in gene transcription studies, disease-related diagnostics, and food safety assessment, MBs will continue to play an irreplaceable role in this field and aid the development of real-time PCR.",
