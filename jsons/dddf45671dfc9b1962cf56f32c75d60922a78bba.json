Virulence studies indicated that the five Chinese IBV isolates caused 10 to 30% mortality in 15-dayold specific pathogen free chickens and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys in all of the dead chickens. Two oligonucleotide pairs, S1Uni2 and S1Oligo3? or S1Oligo5? and S1Oligo3?, were used after propagation of the isolates in embryonated eggs to amplify the S1 protein genes of the spike protein. The cDNA derived by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S1 protein gene had a similar degree of identity ( ]/92%) among the five Chinese IBV isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of the S1 protein gene between the five Chinese IBV isolates and 16 strains of other IBVs varied from 60 to 81%. This clearly showed that the five Chinese IBV isolates comprised a separate genotype.

Through the use of attenuated live as well as inactivated virus vaccines, economic losses due to this disease have been significantly reduced.

The extent of changes to the infected embryo that are induced by IBV vary greatly. Especially for the field strains, the visible changes in the embryos in the first passage can be minimal. Usually, embryo mortality and dwarfing increase as the number of serial passages increases. Some field strains still caused no dwarfing on the third passage, while other methods could detect IBV using inoculated allantoic cells (reviewed by De Wit, 2000) . Of the five IBV isolates in this study, they showed different adaptation to embryos. All the five IBV strains did not cause visible changes in the embryos in the first passage, and four of them caused dwarfing and death of the embryos on the second to fourth passages (Table 1) . For one of the IBV isolates, LHI10, obvious changes in the inoculated embryos were observed in the 10th passage. This isolate may not grow well in chicken embryo and the virus titre may be minimal in the first several passages. Winterfield & Hitchner (1962) first reported a nephrosis condition associated with IB in the United States. Cumming (1962) reported an IB outbreak causing severe kidney lesion in chickens in Australia in the same year. From this time, various nephropathogenic strains of IBV have been identified throughout the world (reviewed by Meulemans & van der Berg, 1998) . In China, nephropathogenic IBV strains of the Massachusetts genotype have isolated in rural chicken farms of Beijing (Li & Yang, 2001 ). In the present study, we isolated three IBV strains from H120-vaccinated flocks and two from non-vaccinated flocks of layer chickens that experienced nephropathogenic infection in four provinces of north China. Virulence studies showed that severe kidney lesions were observed in the dead chicks that had been inoculated with each of the five Chinese IBV isolates. It was reported that nephropathogenic IB occurred in Pennsylvania from 1997 to 2000 in commercial broiler-type and layer-type chicken flocks, with mortality as high as 20% (Ziegler et al., 2002) . Similar mortality was also found in this study by inoculating 15-day-old specific pathogen free chickens with each of the five Chinese IBV isolates (Table 2) . Although the results of this experiment were not a true reflection of the situation in the flocks that the five IBV strains came from, they confirmed that the five IBV isolates are nephropathogenic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 601, "end": 611, "text": "Wit, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1151, "text": "Winterfield & Hitchner (1962)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1244, "text": "Cumming (1962)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1483, "text": "Meulemans & van der Berg, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1619, "text": "(Li & Yang, 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2182, "text": "(Ziegler et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 882, "end": 891, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2333, "end": 2342, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The S1 protein genes of the five IBV isolates, LD3, LS2, LX4, LH2, and LHI10, isolated from 1999 to 2003 in China, shared 95 to 99% of nucleotide identity and 92 to 98% amino acid identity. This strikingly high identity implied a close genetic relationship and possibly indicated a common origin. Not more than 76% nucleotide and amino acid identity was shared between the five IBV isolates and three strains, Q1, T3, and J2, which were also isolated in China before 1999 (Yu et al., 2001) . Isolates Q1, T3, and J2 were isolated from the proventricular tissues of infected chickens with a syndrome associated with lesions of alimentary and respiratory tracts. Unlike the IBV isolates in this study, nephropathogenic infections were not observed from chickens infected with those three IBV strains (Yu et al., 2001) . In addition, nephropathogenic IBV strains that showed more than 99.1 and 97.8% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the S1 protein of standard IBV strain M41 were isolated in Beijing (Li & Yang, 2001) . The S1 protein genes were also compared between the IBV strains isolated in this study and three Massachusetts-type IBV strains, M41, H52 and H120. The results showed that they had only 74 to 77% nucleotide and amino acid identity at the level of S1 protein gene and indicated that they belonged to different genotypes. On the basis of the genotype and pathogenicity, we can speculate that there were at least three different genotypes of IBV strains circulating in China. The spreading of a virus from one area or country to another could be due, at least in part, to its improper introduction by the trading of birds or by the use of attenuated vaccines. With the exception of the Massachusetts strain, a very interesting aspect of IBV epidemiology, as far as it is possible to know, is the presence and the spreading of the various IBV serotypes in different continents. About 20 emergent serotypes in North America did not spread to other continents. Similarly, the European, Australian, and Asiatic serotypes apparently did not spread elsewhere. In this study, the S1 protein genes of the five Chinese isolates were compared with two IBV strains, A1211 and A1171, which were isolated in Taiwan; one Japanese isolate, KB8523; three European isolates, UK/7/93, D274, and B1648; four American isolates, GA/2787/98, Connecticut, Beaudette, and Ark99. These IBV strains shared only 48 to 79% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the S1 protein of the five Chinese isolates. Obviously, they belonged to different genotypes.
