Since all age groups are affected and a high fatality is noted in the elderly and those with co-morbidities (Donnelly et al., 2003), there is an urgent need to find a cure. Prospective clinical and viral load studies in nasopharyngeal secretions from SARS patients showed that viral replication peaked at the 10th day after the onset of symptoms with subsequent clinical deterioration in 30% of the cases despite a decreasing viral load (Peiris et al., 2003). Therefore the key facet of management should include respiratory support, immuno-modulation in selected cases and early institution of an effective antiviral agent. Such an antiviral agent, if given early, may decrease the peak viral load and the associated immuno-dysregulatory damage. At the moment, there are no commercially available antiviral agents tailored-made for SARS coronavirus. There is an urgent need to search for an agent with a known in use clinical and toxicity profile so that a randomised placebo control trial can be conducted if the epidemic recurs in one of the coming winters. We report in this study on the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of 10 isolates of SARS coronavirus to commercially available antiviral agents and pure chemical compounds including baicalin, glycyrrhizin, and chlorogenic acid extracted from traditional Chinese herbs.",

In the scheme, a recipe \u201cQing Fei Jie Du Tang\u201d (soup for clearing the lung and detoxification) was recommended which consists of Huang Qi (Astragalus membranaceus) 15 gm, Chai Hu (Bupleurum chinense) 10 gm, Ma Huang (Ephedra sinica) 5 gm, Xing Ren (Prunus armeniaca) 10 gm, Sheng She Gao (Plaster Stone) 30 gm, Sheng Yi Ren (Coix lacryma-jobi) 15 gm, Gua Wei Pi (Benincasa hispida) 15 gm, Jie Geng (Platycodon grandiflorum) 9 gm, Bo He (Mentha haplocalyx) 6 gm, Huang Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis) 10 gm, Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) 5 gm, Jin Yin Hua (Flos lonicerae) 15 gm, and Qing Hao (Artemisia apiacea) 15 gm. Among them, only Scutellaria baicalensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Flos lonicerae and Artemisia apiacea have their pure chemically defined ingredients being extracted, purified and documented to have antimicrobial activities. Consequently, the main bioactive compounds, namely, baicalin (derived from Scutellaria baicalensis), glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza uralensis), chlorogenic acid (from Flos lonicerae) and artesunate (from Artemisia apiacea) were investigated in the present study.",

They were extracted as we have previously reported (Lu et al., 2003). The concentrations of baicalin, glycyrrhizin, chlorogenic acid, and lopinavir in the cell culture system were also monitored by HPLC (Lu et al., 2003) whereas the concentration of others were monitored by neutralization assays with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Indiana strain and a laboratory strain of Influenza A H1N1.The procedures used for in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing are as follows. Initial screening of all compounds against the prototype SARS coronavirus strain no. 39849 was performed in 96-well microtitre plates seeded with foetal rhesus kidney-4 cells. Two-fold dilutions of antiviral agents starting from more than four times the peak serum concentration after the maximum therapeutic dose to less than one-quarter of the trough serum concentration were tested in quadruplicate against 100 TCID50 of SARS coronavirus. A corresponding set of cell controls with drug but without virus inoculation was used as controls for drug toxicity. The cells were scored for the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 and 72 h. Those compounds with demonstrable in vitro inhibitory activity were re-assayed against the other nine strains of SARS coronavirus collected from different patients from different hospitals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Their antiviral activities were also compared in both foetal rhesus kidney-4 (fRHK-4) and Vero-E6 cell lines. Those likely to have clinically significant inhibitory activity were tested by the plaque reduction assay.",

During the last pandemic of SARS, the only available means for control were public health measures such as isolation of suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and personal protective infection control procedures for high-risk individuals such as health care workers. There is an urgent need to find effective antiviral agents with acceptable side effect profiles. In developing countries such as China, commercially available western antiviral medicine is unlikely to be affordable by most people. Moreover, the SARS mortality of Mainland China was only 7% comparing favourably with the 15% to 27% of other areas (WHO, 2003). China is also the only place where traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were extensively used for treatment of SARS. The development of vaccine will take a much longer time. Therefore, we undertook these antiviral susceptibility tests for all commercially available antiviral agents in the HKSAR and pure chemicals purified from traditional Chinese herbs known to have antimicrobial activity. These chosen herbs were included in a standard formula used for the treatment of SARS in China and the HKSAR.",

Using the fRhK-4 cell line, we have shown that ribavirin, rimantadine, lopinavir, and baicalin also have detectable antiviral activities. However, like the interferons and glycyrrhizin, their activities tend to decrease with incubation beyond 48 h (Table 3). Judging from the achievable serum levels with standard oral or parenteral dosing, rimantadine, ribavirin, glycyrrhizin, and even the two interferons are unlikely to have clinically significant in vivo activities. Moreover, lopinavir, and rimantadine have a relatively inferior selectivity index of 4 to 32. Upon subsequent testing with Vero-E6 cell line, both leukocytic interferon-alpha and interferon-beta-1a were more active and especially after pre-incubation for 16 h before viral inoculation. The findings suggest that prophylaxis with the interferons should be considered. Though ribavirin was much less active in the Vero cell line, it is highly synergistic with either two interferons. Therefore, a combination of ribavirin with either of these two interferons should be considered for the treatment of SARS.",

What is interesting was the demonstration of activity of leukocytic interferon-alpha despite the lack of activity of the recombinant interferon-alpha-2a and interferon-alpha-2b. This was not unexpected because this preparation of leukocytic interferon-alpha is a multi-subtype natural interferon with predominantly interferon alpha-1 and alpha-2 in contrast to the other commercial preparation with a single subtype of recombinant interferon-alpha-2. In in vitro studies, different subtypes have been found to have different antiviral activities as well as immunological effects (Foster et al., 1996). It was also demonstrated that leukocytic interferon-alpha had a superior antiviral effect than that of recombinant interferon on Human immunodeficiency Virus infection (Fan et al., 1993).",

The serum level after 100 mg of glycyrrhizin orally was not detectable. Even with a 200 mg dose of intravenous administration, the peak serum level is only 80 \u03bcg/ml which is still below the EC50 of glycyrrhizin. Although an oral dose of 1.5 gm of baicalin can only achieve a serum concentration of 0.47 \u03bcg/ml, intravenous administration of a 360 mg dose of baicalin in human can achieve a peak serum concentration of 74 \u03bcg/ml. Thus intravenous baicalin should be considered for treatment in randomised placebo control trials in developing countries where such formulations are available and affordable. Baicalin was shown to inhibit HIV-1 by two mechanisms (Kitamura et al., 1998, Li et al., 2000). At the level of cellular entry, baicalin can conjugate with selected chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b2 and SDF-1\u03b1, and interfere with their capacity to activate cellular receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 respectively. These two co-recpetors are essential elements for HIV-1 infection and therefore baicalin can inhibit Env-protein mediated fusion of HIV with cells expressing CD4/CCR5 or CD4/CXCR4. Baicalin has also been known to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase probably by interfering with the binding of viral RNA to the RT molecule near the active site of the enzyme.",

Interferon-beta-1a or leukocytic interferon-alpha plus ribavirin appear to be the most effective combination. Since interferons may not be effective in inducing an antiviral state in the uninfected host cells during the first 24 h, a combination with a short course of ribavirin appears to be reasonable. This will also reduce the side effects and fluid volume associated with a full course of ribavirin. Despite the superiority of interferons in the in vitro assays, there is little clinical data of its use in the treatment of acute viral respiratory infection in human. Thus the combination of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir should still be considered since some positive clinical data has already been accumulated in a historical controlled treatment trial (Chu et al., 2004).",
