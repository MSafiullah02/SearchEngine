To facilitate unbiased interpretation, magnetic resonance (MR) images of cats with inflammatory diseases were mixed with images of 24 cats with neurological signs not thought to be associated with inflammatory CNS conditions and the images were reviewed by one observer (CRL) working without any clinical information. Only the interpretations of MR images of cats that satisfied the inclusion criteria for inflammatory CNS disease were used in this study. Abnormalities observed in MR images were categorised according to the following subjective criteria: signal intensity compared to cerebral grey matter; evidence of increased signal intensity in T1-weighted images after gadolinium contrast medium administration; lesion site (telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, myelencephalon, meninges, ependyma); distribution (focal, multifocal, diffuse); margins (distinct or indistinct); presence of ventricular dilatation (mild, moderate, marked); and presence of cerebral or cerebellar herniation.

For this reason, it has been suggested that only positive serum titres >1:1600 should be considered indicative of FIP (Hartmann et al 2003). The dry form of FIP is said to have relatively high FCoV antibody titres and to be rarely seronegative (Foley et al., 1998, Green, 2006); however, cats with neurological FIP can have negative serum titres (Kline et al., 1994, Baroni and Heinold, 1995, Foley et al., 1998). This was observed in four of seven (57%) cats with histologically confirmed FIP in the present study. One reason for negative titres in cats with FIP may be that immune complexes already conjugated with the body's antibodies cannot be recognised by immunological tests (Green 2006). Positive CSF antibody titres were found in both cats with toxoplasmosis.",

Although the number of patients is insufficient for firm conclusions about the sensitivity of MRI, it is apparent that a negative MR scan cannot rule out presence of neurological FIP, as only half the cats with FIP had lesions in MR images. MRI did not appear to detect all cases of CNS inflammation in the population of cats in our study with CSF findings suggestive of CNS inflammation; however, MRI adds information about the sites and morphology of intracranial lesions that helps to distinguish both between neoplasia and inflammatory conditions and, to some extent, between different inflammatory conditions. Compared to computed tomography (CT) (Plummer et al 1992), MRI is thought to have slightly higher overall sensitivity (Lamb et al 2005). Increased sensitivity for multiple lesions and meningeal enhancement makes MR more likely than CT to enable identification of the signs that aid differentiation of intracranial inflammation from neoplasia.",

In six cats with lesions in T1- and/or T2-weighted images, additional lesions were visible in T1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium administration. In three cats, lesions were visible only in T1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium contrast medium administration. Hence, as reported for dogs (Lamb et al 2005), use of gadolinium contrast medium seems to increase the sensitivity of MR for intracranial inflammatory lesions.",

This result contrasts with previous studies in which multifocal lesions were associated with non-neoplastic conditions, including inflammatory disease (Cherubini et al., 2005, Lamb et al., 2005). For example, in a recent study of 25 dogs with inflammatory CSF, abnormalities were found by MRI in 19 (76%) dogs with inflammatory CSF. Two dogs had focal lesions, 10 had multifocal lesions and seven had diffuse lesions (Lamb et al 2005). Both cats with toxoplasmosis in the present study had multifocal lesions on MRI, a finding that has not been reported previously. Variable MR findings have been reported in humans with toxoplasmosis (Brightbill et al., 1996, Dietrich et al., 2000, Chon-Han et al., 2003) including multiple or solitary masses.",

This observation reflects the typical histological distribution of FIP lesions, which principally involve the inner and outer surfaces of the brain (Summers et al 1995). Ventricular dilation in cats with FIP may reflect abnormal CSF drainage, as dilated ventricles have been always observed in association with meningeal and/or ependymal involvement, two structures largely involved in CSF flow regulation (Summers et al 1995). Ventricular dilation may lead to increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum. In MR images the cerebellum is usually considered herniated when the caudal tip of the vermis is within the foramen magnum; this is best assessed in sagittal images. Cerebellar herniation was observed in three of five cats with ventricular dilation in the present study. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is marked variability in the shape of the cerebellar vermis in cats, which may complicate the assessment of herniation. Further studies, with larger numbers, are necessary to validate the MR assessment of the cerebellum in cats.",
