RNAi screening typically begins with the plating of the target cells and introduction of the silencing reagent. For siRNA-based studies, screens are generally performed in an arrayed format where individual genes are targeted with anywhere from 1 to 4 siRNAs/well. In most cases, pooled reagents are preferred, as they provide a cumulative silencing effect that greatly increases the efficacy of gene knockdown. Synthetic silencing reagents can be introduced via forward or reverse transfection protocols (30 -33) , which, in many cell types, lead to efficient intracellular delivery of the siRNA. For cases in which shRNAs are used and expressed from a viral construct, one of two approaches can be employed. In the first, shRNA workflows can parallel siRNA screening processes by adopting a 1-gene-1-well arrayed platform. Alternatively, shRNAs screens often make use of pools of viral particles that contain expression constructs targeting hundreds to thousands of genes. In this scenario, cell plating is followed by virus transduction at low multiplicities of infection, thus ensuring that each infected cell receives only one viral particle. Drug selection follows transduction to eliminate cells that do not carry a gene-targeting construct (27) (28) (29) . Pooled shRNA screens are best suited to output assays that permit selection or outgrowth of cells that exhibit the phenotype of interest, where specific shRNAs, which influence the phenotype (and are consequently enriched or depleted from the population) can be identified by either microarray or next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Cells are then infected with the virus of choice, cultured for an additional period of time, and assayed by one or more techniques (e.g., transcriptional reporters, viral titers) to determine the effect of gene knockdown on various aspects of the viral life cycle. It is worth noting that different silencing reagents permit different types of assays to be incorporated in the workflow. Although the period of gene silencing provided by siRNA can vary with the gene and the cell type being studied, synthetic siRNAs generally provide 3-7 d of gene knockdown (34, 35) .

With regard to hit identification, a term used to identify genes that when silenced have a significant effect on the function being assayed, a number of bioinformatic approaches have been described. In one instance, a Z\u0408 factor is calculated to determine how distinct the positive and negative controls are from each other; subsequently, a Z score, which is a method of normalization to the mean value of the samples on each plate, is commonly used to rank genes (36) . Candidate genes are then categorized for defining features before being validated. A statistical enrichment of targets relative to a reference population is then ranked for validation. Many parameters may be captured in a screen, and these are weighted on the importance to the principle screen phenotype and classified into distinct bins to refine the gene list prior to validation. For example, for an shRNA screen, following NGS analysis, data are subjected to a statistical enrichment of targets relative to a reference population, which results in a ranked list to identify targets for validation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GENERAL WORKFLOW OF HOST-PATHOGEN SCREENING USING RNAi TECHNOLOGY"}, {"text": "siRNA libraries have been constructed with a variety of designs, and while these reagents have been used in a range of studies and cell types, it is important to consider which of these tools is best suited for hostpathogen screens. One potentially relevant consideration centers on activation of cellular immunity pathways. It is well documented that viral infection is monitored by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that trigger an innate immune response upon identifying an evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) (37) . For example, recognition of influenza single-stranded RNA genome by the endosomal PRR, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), leads to a strong antiviral cytokine response (38 -40) . Previous studies have also shown that transfection of short dsRNA (such as siRNA) can also perturb cellular immunity. For example, it has been demonstrated that siRNAs longer than \u03f323-25 bp strongly up-regulate interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes in HeLa cells (41) . Other groups have shown that siRNAs can activate a type I interferon response, particularly through TLR7 and TLR8 (42, 43) . Thus, if both siRNA and virus can independently stimulate TLR pathways, the question arises of how one can effectively screen for host genes that play a role in virus replication. One solution may lie in reagent selection. For example, while most siRNAs are designed to have complete complementarity to the target transcript, one design variable is duplex length. Previous studies have shown that in some cell types, short (19 bp) siRNAs effectively silence genes but are weaker activators of TLR signaling pathways (44) . As such, under certain circumstances, these reagents can minimize the immune stimulatory effects that would otherwise complicate RNAi screens involving pathogens. In addition, several groups have demonstrated that modification of particular nucleotides with defined chemical groups (e.g.,2\u0408-O-methyl,2\u0408OMe) can greatly reduce the immunostimulatory effects of siRNA (45) (46) (47) .

Extensive studies have shown that in addition to targeting the mRNA of interest, siRNAs can act in a similar fashion to miRNAs and attenuate the translation of dozens of genes (48, 49) . False positives (referred to as \"off-targets\") induced by this mechanism are frequently mediated by shRNA and siRNA screen stages broken into chronological order. Stages can take different times depending on the assay and quantitation method. Bioinformatics analysis is an ongoing effort that intervenes in the screen process at several points. Central to each screening platform is identification of robust positive (\u03e9ve) and negative controls (\u03eave). For the siRNA platform, siGLO, a fluorescent reporter, is used to indicate transfection efficiency. the seed region of the siRNA (nt 2-8), and may result in a 2-to 4-fold down-regulation of unintended targets (49) .

Use of these reagents during primary screening can minimize the number of false positives and thereby reduce the time and costs associated with downstream validation. Alternatively, in cases where pools of siRNA were used in the primary screen, deconvolution of the pools and demonstration that multiple individual siRNAs (having different seed sequences) give the same phenotype increases the level of confidence that the phenotype is related to the knockdown of the targeted gene. Lastly, bioinformatics can be effectively used to identify off-target effects. Cross-checking the seed sequence of siRNAs that induce a phenotype with the seeds of known miRNAs (host and pathogen) can often identify instances in which one or more siRNAs are mimicking a miRNA.

Furthermore, each screen examined different subsets of host genes and utilized unrelated cell models ranging from permissive cells (32, 33) to cells that influenza does not naturally infect (30, 31, 67) .

Overall, only 3 genes were independently validated in 4 of the 6 screens, 9 genes were validated in 3 of 6 screens, and 86 genes were validated across 2 screens ( Table 2 ). The absence of overlap in influenza screen hit lists suggests that the identity of specific cellular factors involved in the response to an influenza virus infection is context dependent and influenced by experimental factors that vary from screen to screen.

On the basis of the findings from the meta-analyses of influenza screens (31, 67, 136 -138) , it is likely that influenza virus principally coopts host genes late during virus replication. Succinctly, influenza virus carries all necessary proteins to infect a cell and deliver its vRNP into the cell nucleus. However, viral proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm; thus, the virus must use host proteins and pathways to import NP and RNA polymerases back into the nucleus to form new vRNP. Likewise, the assembly of influenza components occurs at the plasma membrane, requiring host mechanisms to move new vRNP from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and then traffic the viral protein components toward the membrane for assembly and packaging of new virions. This hypothesis is consistent with the subtle differences that have been observed in viral genomic expression relative to the huge differences observed in high-content analysis and in virus replication (33, 136) .

It will be vital to the success of this emerging field that such collaborative initiatives promote the development of data standards and best practices that facilitate the comparison of data from complementary screens.
