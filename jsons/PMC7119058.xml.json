            "text": "Monocytes/macrophages play the central role in inflammatory responses, immunity as well as the stress response (Franceschi et al., 2000). Furthermore, a chronic, age-related, progressive stimulation of macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory status was postulated and known as \u2018macroph-aging\u2019 (Franceschi et al., 2000). One previous study actually showed significantly increased constitutive production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in circulating monocytes of older female compared to young adult female human individuals, whereas no changes in the constitutive TNF-\u03b1 production were observed (Sadeghi et al., 1999). On the other hand, there is evidence for decreased in vitro production of some cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, in LPS-stimulated whole blood or monocytes of elderly humans (Bruunsgaard et al., 1999, Sadeghi et al., 1999). In aged mice, a reduced capacity was observed of activated macrophages to produce IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide (Wallace et al., 1995). Furthermore, aged rat monocytes/macrophages exhibit a reduced constitutive MCP-1 production (Reale et al., 2003).",

            "text": "There is a paucity of information on the constitutive production of cytokines by monocytes/macrophages, for all species. A previous study on human monocytes demonstrated constitutive production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 by unstimulated human monocytes in young and old females (Sadeghi et al., 1999); whereas another study demonstrated variable constitutive transcription of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 in isolated, short term-cultured, unstimulated monocytes in cats of different ages (Kipar et al., 2001). However, with regard to monocyte-associated viral infections in the cat, certain age-related differences in susceptibility have been noted. For example, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a coronavirus-induced, immune-mediated, fatal systemic disease, affects most frequently young animals between 6 mo and 2 yr of age (Rohrbach et al., 2001). However, aged cats develop a less intense immune response, with delayed antibody production to experimental feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection compared to young animals (George et al., 1993). In both infectious diseases, the infected monocyte is essential for viral distribution (Magnani et al., 1994, Kipar et al., 2004) and in cases of FIP, the activated monocyte also mediates the development of its pathogenetic hallmark, granulomatous phlebitis (Kipar et al., 2005). The question arises as to whether age-related constitutive changes in monocyte functions are responsible for potential differences in responses to infectious agents. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate constitutive transcription levels of cytokines in cats over a large age range, from 15 mo to 10 yr of age.",

From each cDNA sample, parallel reactions were performed, in duplicates, in separate tubes for the detection of fGAPDH (internal control/calibrator), fIL-1\u03b2, fIL-6, fIL-10, fIL-12 p40 and fTNF-\u03b1.

The C\nT of the calibrator, fGAPDH, was subtracted from the C\nT of each experimental sample to give the value \u0394C\nT. For samples where a cytokine mRNA signal was not observed after 45 cycles, a plausible \u0394C\nT was created. This value was ascertained from the lowest C\nT for fGAPDH (obtained from the sample with the highest expression of GAPDH) subtracted from 45 (number of cycles). The resulting value was rounded to the next higher integer value. The amount of target was calculated by 2\u2212\u0394CT, resulting in evaluation of the experimental samples as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator fGAPDH (Kipar et al., 2001).",

Transcription levels were generally variable, both among cats of the same age (Fig. 1\n) and in individual cats at different time points. IL-1\u03b2 was overall transcribed most intensely, followed by TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10. IL-12 p40 levels were generally very low (Fig. 1). For IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 p40, a statistically significant association was found between the level of transcription and age. Higher transcription levels were noted in younger and older cats than in those of middle age (Fig. 1). For IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, transcription levels were similar in the youngest and oldest cats, whereas IL-12 p40 transcription was highest in the youngest cats. For IL-10, an overall decline in constitutive transcription with age was indicated, but not statistically significant (Fig. 1). TNF-\u03b1 levels were on average less variable throughout the examination period. A slight drop in transcription was observed in the middle-aged cats, but not statistically significant (Fig. 1). The multivariable regression analysis did not identify more suitable models to evaluate the association between cytokine transcription levels and age. Results of the Pearson correlation coefficients matrix are illustrated in Table 1\n. Transcription of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 appeared highly correlated, independent of age. A trend for a positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and age was found as well as a moderate negative correlation between IL-12 p40 transcription and age.",

            "text": "This report presents the results of an initial study to assess the functional state of monocytes over a wide age range in cats, by evaluating a set of both pro-inflammatory and down-regulatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40 and TNF-\u03b1), in isolated, short-time cultured, unstimulated monocytes. The age range of 15 mo to 10 yr in cats used in this study covers most of adult, pre-senile life of healthy cats. This study provides evidence for a decline in constitutive transcription of some cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 p40) from early adulthood to middle age (approx. 5 yr), with their subsequent increase in older cats. The latter levels approach those seen in the youngest cats (for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) or are comparatively lower (for IL-12 p40). IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 do not show any significant age-related changes in their constitutive transcription. Nonetheless, there was a tendency for a progressive decline in IL-10 transcription with age. TNF-\u03b1 transcription levels, however, appear mostly stable over the entire age range, with a slight depression in the middle-aged cats.",

            "text": "Our study has two outcomes, namely to clearly emphasise the general importance of age-matched controls in studies on alterations of immune cell populations. Also, this study supports the hypothesis of a general, progressively increasing \u2018pro-inflammatory status\u2019 of monocytes/macrophages with age (Franceschi et al., 2000). It provides evidence that monocytes are at least partly responsible for the progressive increase in blood IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels observed in older individuals (Franceschi et al., 1999, Bruunsgaard et al., 1999). However, similar to a previous study on human monocytes (Sadeghi et al., 1999), the results of this study do not suggest involvement of monocytes in the induction of elevated TNF-\u03b1 blood levels of older individuals, as observed in humans (Bruunsgaard et al., 1999). Our study shows correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production previously found in LPS-stimulated human monocytes (Bruunsgaard et al., 1999), that can be explained by the stimulatory effect of IL-1\u03b2 on IL-6 production (Abbas and Lichtman, 2003). On the other hand, IL-6 is known to both suppress IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production and block the effect of IL-1\u03b2 by inducing the production of IL-1 receptor antagonist (Schindler et al., 1990, Jordan et al., 1995). This might explain why there was no obvious increase in TNF-\u03b1 production in the older cats. Furthermore, by upregulating IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 could actually inhibit the upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, a cytokine with far wider effects than IL-1\u03b2 itself (Abbas and Lichtman, 2003), and thereby limit its own harmful effects in aged individuals (Schindler et al., 1990, Jordan et al., 1995). The age-related decline in IL-10 transcription, however, might foster IL-12 p40 production due to lack of inhibition (Abbas and Lichtman, 2003).",

Since this progressive inflammatory status appears to occur in both ill and healthy older individuals, then it can be regarded as a characteristic of both successful and unsuccessful aging (Franceschi et al., 1999, Franceschi et al., 2000). Upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 might represent adaptation of the immune system to ensure its capacity to deal with infectious agents (Abbas and Lichtman, 2003). In the case of humans and non-barrier-maintained animals, it might also be the consequence of the successful adaptation to stresses which occurred throughout an individual's life (Franceschi et al., 2000).",

For example, aged mice have exhibited decreased IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and nitric oxide production (Effros et al., 1991, Wallace et al., 1995), whereas monocytes from aged humans exhibited significantly lower IL-1\u03b2, but increased IL-6 and IL-10 production after stimulation (Sadeghi et al., 1999). In aged mice and rats, reduced MHC class II and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 transcription and translation, respectively, was observed (Herrero et al., 2002, Reale et al., 2003). In another study higher phagocytic capacity after LPS treatment, despite lower phagocytosis levels without activation was described in rat macrophages (Tasat et al., 2003). In conjunction with the present study, these findings suggest an imbalanced state of monocyte/macrophage function and thereby the innate immune response with age. They also indicate that by down-regulating certain constitutive levels of stimulatory functions such as MHC II expression, monocytes may counteract and balance their otherwise increasingly pro-inflammatory state in aging individuals (Franceschi et al., 2000).",
