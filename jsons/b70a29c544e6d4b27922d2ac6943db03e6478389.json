This conceivable route of transmission has already been proposed for other viral infections that were considered unlikely to be transferred sexually, including Ebola (Cardona-Maya et al. 2019) and Zika viruses (Cardona Maya et al. 2016 , Feldmann 2018 . It was also recently reported that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of the novel coronavirus into human cells. Using online datasets, Fan and colleagues (Fan et al. 2020) clearly demonstrated that ACE2 is highly expressed in Leydig cells and cells of the seminiferous tubules in the human testis. Thus, the binding of the virus to these ACE2 positive cells could potentially not only cause severe testicular tissue alterations but also serve as a source of the virus. Therefore, it is worrying that this recent coronavirus outbreak could have serious effects on fertility worldwide. Despite that these findings still needs to be substantiated in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the ASRM and SART have already issued warnings to this extend. It is advised that prospective parents, ART patients, gamete donors and gestational carriers, who meet the diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 should avoid becoming pregnant or participate in any fertility programs (Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 2020). The Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) has also stated that it is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious viruses (CDC, 2020). In Italy, one of the current COVID-19 epicenters, authorities are mandating that all gamete donors should be interviewed regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms and for recent travel to high-risk areas even in the absence of evidence of transmission of the virus within reproductive cells. A 2-week suspension from the end of symptoms is implemented in the case of donors showing respiratory symptoms, while similarly a 2-week suspension is required from donors who have returned from an area at risk (La Marca et al., 2020) .",

Precautionary measurements should even be practiced by candidates who have not yet been tested positive for the coronavirus and also in those infected even after the signs and symptoms have resolved. It is recommended to avoid possible transfection, by refraining from sexual relations without protection, as the testis can serve as a viral reservoir since the virus could likely persist for longer periods of time in the male reproductive system than compared to other body fluids.",
