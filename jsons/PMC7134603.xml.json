Thus, the ratio \u03c9=d\nN/d\nS measures the difference between the two rates and is most easily understood from a mathematical description of a codon substitution model (Box 2\n). If an amino acid change is neutral, it will be fixed at the same rate as a synonymous mutation, with \u03c9=1. If the amino acid change is deleterious, purifying selection (Box 1) will reduce its fixation rate, thus \u03c9<1. Only when the amino acid change offers a selective advantage is it fixed at a higher rate than a synonymous mutation, with \u03c9>1. Therefore, an \u03c9 ratio significantly higher than one is convincing evidence for diversifying selection.Box 1Box 1. Glossary\n\nBox 2Box 2. A model of codon substitutionThe codon is considered the unit of evolution. The substitution rate from codons i to j (i#j) is given as:\nParameter k is the transition/transversion rate ratio, \u03c0j is the equilibrium frequency of codon j and \u03c9 (=d\nN/d\nS) measures the selective pressure on the protein. The qij are relative rates because time and rate are confounded in such an analysis. Given the rate matrix Q={q\nij}, the transition probability matrix over time t is calculated as:P(t)={pij(t)}=eQtwhere p\nij(t) is the probability that codon i becomes codon j after time t. Likelihood calculation on a phylogeny involves summing over all possible codons in extinct ancestors (internal nodes of the tree). After Refs 16,18,27,79.",

            "text": "The codon-based analysis (Box 2) cannot infer whether synonymous substitutions are driven by mutation or selection, but it does not assume that synonymous substitutions are neutral. For example, highly biased codon usage can be caused by both mutational bias and selection (e.g. for translational efficiency 6), and can greatly affect synonymous substitution rates. However, by employing parameters \u03c0j for the frequency of codon j in the model (Box 2), estimation of substitution rates will fully account for codon-usage bias (Box 1), irrespective of its source. Because parameter \u03c9 is a measure of selective pressure on a protein, it differentiates codon-based analyses from the more general tests of neutrality proposed in population genetics 7., 8.. These general tests often lack the power to determine the sources of the departure from the strict neutral model, such as changes in population size, fluctuating environment or different forms of selection.",

            "text": "Two classes of methods have been suggested to estimate d\nN and d\nS between two protein-coding DNA sequences. The first class includes over a dozen intuitive methods developed since the early 1980s 5., 9., 10., 11., 12., 13., 14., 15.. These methods involve the following steps: counting synonymous (S) and nonsynonymous (N) sites in the two sequences, counting synonymous and nonsynonymous differences between the two sequences, and correcting for multiple substitutions at the same site. S and N are defined as the sequence length multiplied by the proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes before selection on the protein 14., 16.. Most of these methods make simplistic assumptions about the nucleotide substitution process and also involve ad hoc treatment of the data that cannot be justified 14., 15.; therefore, we refer to these methods of estimating d\nN and d\nS as approximate methods. The methods of Miyata and Yasunaga 5, and Nei and Gojobori 9, assume an equal rate for transitions (T\u2194C and A\u2194G) and transversions (T,C\u2194A,G), as well as a uniform codon usage. Because transitions at the third \u2018wobble\u2019 position are more likely to be synonymous than transversions, ignoring the transition/transversion rate ratio leads to underestimation of S and overestimation of N\n10. Efforts have been taken to incorporate the transition/transversion rate bias (Box 1) when counting sites and differences 10., 11., 12., 13., 14.. The effect of biased codon usage has largely been ignored 17; however, extreme codon-usage bias can have devastating effects on the stimation of d\nN and d\nS (see the next section) 15., 18.. A recent ad hoc method 15 incorporates both transition and codon-usage biases.",

            "text": "Computer simulation has been used to examine the performance of different estimation methods; the findings are consistent with observations made in real data analyses 14., 15., 19.. We demonstrate the effects of different estimation procedures using human and orangutan \u03b12-globin genes (Table 2\n). For comparison, different assumptions are made in ML concerning the transition/transversion rate bias and the codon-usage bias. The simpler models are each rejected when compared with more complex models by likelihood-ratio tests, confirming biased transition rates and codon usage. Thus, estimates from ML accounting for both biases (Model 8, Table 2) are expected to be the most reliable. We make the following observations:\u2022Assumptions appear to matter more than methods. The approximate methods and ML produce similar results under similar assumptions. The method of Nei and Gojobori is similar to ML under a model that ignores both transition/transversion bias and codon-usage bias (Model 1, Table 2), whereas the methods of Ina and Li are similar to ML under a model accounting for the transition/transversion bias but ignoring codon-usage bias (Model 2, Table 2). The method of Yang and Nielsen 15 is similar to ML under a model accounting for both biases (Model 6, Table 2). However, for distantly related sequences, ad hoc treatment in approximate methods can lead to serious biases even under the correct assumptions 19.\u2022Ignoring the transition/transversion rate bias leads to underestimation of S, overestimation of d\nS and underestimation of the \u03c9 ratio 10.\u2022Codon-usage bias in these data has the opposite effect to the transition/transversion bias; ignoring codon-usage bias leads to overestimation of S, underestimation of d\nS and overestimation of \u03c9. This gene is extremely GC-rich at the third codon position, with base frequencies at 9% (T), 52% (C), 1% (A) and 37% (G). Most changes at the third position (before selection at the amino acid level) are transversions between C and G. Thus, the number of synonymous sites is less than half that expected under equal base and codon frequencies. Although, in theory, the bias caused by unequal codon frequencies can be in the opposite direction 15, we have not encountered a real gene showing that pattern. Such codon-usage bias appears to have misled previous analyses examining the relationship between the GC content at silent sites and d\nS, because those studies ignored the codon-usage bias when estimating d\nS\n21.\u2022Different methods can produce different estimates, even when the sequences are highly similar. The sequences used in Table 2 are only about 10% different at silent sites and, 1% different at nonsynonymous sites; however, estimates of \u03c9 are three times different. Because all estimation procedures partition the total numbers of sites and differences into synonymous and nonsynonymous categories, underestimation of one means overestimation of the other, thus resulting in large errors in the \u03c9 ratio.\n",

            "text": "Methods based on ancestral reconstruction might not provide reliable statistical tests because they ignore errors and biases in reconstructed ancestral sequences (Box 3\n). The ML method has the advantage of not relying on reconstructed ancestral sequences. It can also easily incorporate features of DNA sequence evolution, such as the transition/transversion rate bias and codon-usage bias, and is thus based on a more realistic evolutionary model. When likelihood-ratio tests suggest adaptive evolution along certain lineages, ancestral reconstruction might be useful to pinpoint the involved amino acids and to infer ancestral proteins, which can be synthesized and examined in the laboratory 31., 32..Box 3Box 3. Likelihood and BayesThe statistical-estimation theory used in the methods discussed in this review can be explained with the following simple hypothetical example. Suppose that a population is an admixture of two groups of people in the proportions 60% and 40%, and a certain disease occurs at a rate of 1% in Group I and of 0.1% in Group II. Suppose a random sample of 100 individuals is taken from the population, what is the probability that three of them carry the disease? The probability that a random individual carries the disease (D) is an average over the two groups (G\n1 and G\n2):(1)p=P(D)=P(G1)\u00d7P(D|G1)+P(G2)\u00d7P(D|G2)=0.6\u00d70.01+0.4\u00d70.001=0.0064Similarly, the probability that an individual does not carry the disease is:(2)p(D\u0304)=P(G1)\u00d7P(D\u0304|G1)+P(G2)\u00d7P(D\u0304|G2)=0.6\u00d70.99+0.4\u00d70.999=0.9936=1\u2212 pThe probability that three out of 100 individuals carry the disease is given by the binomial probability:(3)P=100!3!\u00d797[p3(1\u2212p)97]=0.0227\nP=100!3!x97!p3(1\u2212p)97=0.0227\nP=100!3!x97!p3(1\u2212p)97=0.0227If Eq. (3) involves an unknown parameter [such as the rate P(D\u2223G\n1) in Group I], that parameter can be estimated by maximizing Eq. (3). In that case, Eq. (3) gives the probability of observing the data (sample) and is called the likelihood function.The second question is to calculate the probability that an individual in the sample who carries the disease is from Group I. The Bayes theorem gives this probability as:(4)P(G1|D)=P(G1)\u00d7P(D|G1)P(D)=0.6\u00d70.01/0.0064=0.94Note that this is just the proportion of the contribution from Group I to P(D) in Eq. (1). Thus, this individual is most likely to be from Group I. Similarly, a healthy individual in the sample is more likely to be from Group I than from Group II because(5)P(G1|D\u0304)=P(G1)\u00d7P(D\u0304|G1)P(D\u0304)=0.6\u00d70.99/0.9936=0.5978 and P(G2|D\u0304)=1\u2212P(G1|D\u0304)=0.4022\nIn methods for inferring sites under positive selection36\n,\n37, we let D in the example be the data at a site and G\ni be the ith site class with the d\nN/d\nS ratio \u03c9i. The probability of observing data at a site is then an average over the site classes (Eq. (1)). The product of such probabilities over sites constitutes the likelihood (Eq. (3)), from which we estimate any unknown parameters, such as the branch lengths and parameters in the \u03c9 distribution over sites. After the parameters are estimated, we use the Bayes theorem to calculate the probability that any site, given data at that site, is from each site class ((4), (5)).Another straightforward application of the theory is ancestral sequence reconstruction; in this case, we replace G\ni with a reconstruction (characters at interior nodes of the phylogeny) at a site. When we calculate the likelihood function, the probability of data at a site P(D) is a sum over all possible ancestral reconstructions (G\ni\ns) ((1), (2)). After parameters are estimated, the reconstruction that makes the greatest contribution to P(D) is the most likely ((4), (5))24.The Bayes method discussed here is known as the empirical Bayes, because it uses estimates of parameters and does not account for their sam-pling errors. This might be a concern if parameters are estimated from small samples or if the posterior probabilities are sensitive to parameter estimates. An alternative approach is the hierarchical Bayes method, which accounts for the uncertainty in unknown parameters by averaging over their prior distribution.Note that the reconstructed ancestral sequences24, as well as the inferred site classes in the site-class models 36\n,\n37, are pseudo data and involve systematic biases. To appreciate such biases, note that in the previous example, the Bayes calculations ((4), (5)) predict that each of the 100 individuals in the sample, healthy or sick, are from Group I. Although this is the best prediction, the accuracy is low. If such inferred group identities are used for further statistical analysis, misleading results might follow.",

They tested whether the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions at each site is greater than the average over all sites in the sequence. Suzuki and Gojobori 35 took a more systematic approach. For each site in the sequence, they estimated the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites and differences along the tree using reconstructed ancestral sequences, and then tested whether the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions differed from the neutral expectation (\u03c9=1). Suzuki and Gojobori's criterion is more stringent than Fitch et al.'s, because the \u03c9 ratio averaged over sites is almost always,<1. These methods are expected to require many sequences in the data set so that there are enough changes at individual sites. Furthermore, the reliability of significance values produced by these methods might be affected by the use of ancestral reconstruction, which is most unreliable at the positively selected or variable sites 24, and by codon composition bias, which is most extreme at a single site.",

The test of positive selection then involves two major steps: first, to test whether sites exist where \u03c9>1, which is achieved by a likelihood-ratio test comparing a model that does not allow for such sites with a more general model that does; and second, to use the Bayes theorem to identify positively selected sites when they exist.

The null model, M1 (neutral), assumes a class of conserved sites with \u03c9=0 and another class of neutral sites with \u03c9=1. The alternative model, M2 (selection), adds a third class of sites with \u03c9 estimated from the data. (The model codes are those used in the codeml program in the PAML package.) If M2 fits the data significantly better than M1 and the estimated \u03c9 ratio for the third class in M2 is >1, then some sites are under diversifying selection. Zanotto et al. 38 used this test to identify several sites under strong positive selection in the nef gene of HIV, whereas both pairwise comparison and sliding-window analysis failed. This comparison was later found to lack power in some genes because M1 does not account for sites with 0,<\u03c9<1 and the third class in M2 is forced to account for such sites 37. Thus, Yang et al. 37 implemented several new models. For example, the beta distribution (M7 beta) is a flexible null model with 0<\u03c9<1, and can be compared with an alternative that adds an additional site class with \u03c9 estimated (M8 beta&\u03c9). A general discrete model (M3) was also implemented 37. These models identified positive selection in six out of ten genes the authors analysed. Fig. 1\nshows the use of a discrete model (M3) with three classes to identify sites under diversifying selection in abalone sperm lysin 39.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: The identification of sites under positive selection from the sperm lysin genes of 25 abalone species. (a) Posterior probabilities for site classes with different \u03c9 ratios along the sequence. The lysin sequence of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) is shown below the x-axis. ML estimates under Model M3 (discrete) 37 suggest three site classes with the \u03c9 ratios at \u03c90=0.085 (grey), \u03c91=0.911 (green) and \u03c92=3.065 (red), and with proportions p0=0.329, \u03c11=0.402 and \u03c12=0.269. These proportions are the prior probabilities (Box 1) that any site belongs to the three classes. The data (codon configurations in different species) at a site alter the prior probabilities dramatically, and thus the posterior probabilities might be different from the prior probabilities. For example, the posterior probabilities for Site 1 are 0.944, 0.056 and 0.000, and thus this site is likely to be under strong purifying selection. The posterior probabilities for Site 4 are 0.000, 0.000 and 1.000, and thus this site is almost certainly under diversifying selection. (b) Lysin crystal structure from the red abalone (Protein Data Bank file 1LIS), with sites coloured according to their most likely class inferred in (a). The structure starts from amino acid four (His) at the N-terminus, because the first three amino acids are unresolved. The five \u03b1-helices are indicated: \u03b11 from amino acids 13 to 38, \u03b12 from 44 to 74, \u03b13 from 82 to 95, \u03b14 from 99 to 107 and \u03b15 from 116 to 123. Note that sites potentially under positive selection (red) are scattered all over the primary sequence but tend to cluster around the top and bottom of the crystal structure.
