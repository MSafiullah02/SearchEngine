An example is atlantoaxial subluxation of toy breeds in which ligamentous and dens malformations create C1-C2 instability and an increased risk of C1-C2 luxation.\u2022Some anomalies slowly worsen over the life of the animal to cause progressive worsening of signs. Dogs with congenital arachnoid cysts show slowly progressive spinal cord signs as the cavitating lesion expands in size. In dogs with caudal occipital malformation syndrome (COMS), progressive foramen magnum compression causes disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and syringohydromyelia formation. Signs of slowly progressive spinal cord dysfunction can be seen at almost any age.\u2022Vertebral anomalies that compromise the stability of the vertebral column or the canal size may cause spinal cord dysfunction secondary to compression. For example, hemivertebra may lead to vertebral body luxation, and malarticulation/malformation of articular facets may lead to spinal canal stenosis.\n",
