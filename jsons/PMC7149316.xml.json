This type of approach initially ignored the origin of the causative microorganisms and focused on the accurate diagnosis of the disease agent. An example of this type of approach was the testing of cats that were clinically ill for feline leukemia virus (FeLV). If tested positive, they were segregated or euthanized. Further examples include FIP, CHV, Johne's disease (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), and the mucosal disease form of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus. Expanded use of diagnostic results by the veterinarian and client allowed for some corrective management steps to be taken. These included the use of vaccination when available or segregation and culling to reduce the source of the infection in the population. Based on this latter principle, the reduction of the source of the infection, a different approach has been taken. One may consider this an epidemiologic view of the disease process (Susser and Susser, 1996a).",

This is presented in Fig. 2\n. The primary emphasis in this scheme is to view animals preclinical and determine the disease risk and/or zoonotic potential of the infection. This has been the approach for some retroviral infections (Evermann and Jackson, 1997; Knowles, 1997) and bacterial infections with public health concerns, such as E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. infections (Evans and Davies, 1996; Firstenberg-Eden and Sullivan, 1997; McDonough and Simpson, 1996). The ultimate goal of the assessment of preclinical testing is to initiate a preventive management type of control. This type of approach places more emphasis on early testing and management of infected animals rather than on diseased animals.",

The control of infections with a low degree of transmissibility and narrow host range, such as caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) virus, is much more realistic than the control of diseases with a wide host range, such as chlamydia and Salmonella spp., or those agents spread by arthropod vectors, such as arboviruses and rickettsia (Gregory and Schaffner, 1997; Hewinson et al., 1997; Knowles, 1997; Raoult and Roux, 1997; Saluzzo and Dodet, 1997). The ecology of infection provides the veterinarian with vital information with which to make decisions. The ecology of six different agents is listed in Table I\n. The ecology of infection is divided into infection rate, attack rate (progress to become clinical), and mortality rate. It can be seen that the infection rate usually exceeds the attack rate and mortality rate in the majority of cases. Exceptions to this generalization are the mucosal disease form of BVD that occur in cattle that are tolerant to BVD and persistently infected (PI), and rabies infections in mammals (Innocent et al., 1997; Smith, 1996).",

The schematic allows the veterinarian to readily use a graphic approach with clients to explain the differences between infection and disease. Rabies virus is used as an example of a microorganism with a low infection rate, but high mortality. (This figure would be different if one were to diagram the ecology of rabies in bats, the natural reservoir for rabies in the United States.) The CAE virus is used as an example of an infection in goats with a high infection rate, but lower attack rates, and much lower fatality rates (Fig. 4\n). With retroviruses, such as CAE virus, bovine leukosis virus (BLV), and equine infectious anemia (EIA), the ecology can also be subdivided into progressor (progress onto clinical signs and/or fatality) or nonprogressor (remains clinically normal, but infected and potentially contagious). With persistent bacterial infections, such as Salmonella and many members of the Rickettsiaciae, the ecology can be subdivided into clinical disease leading to mortality or clinical disease leading to a chronic carrier state. This chronic carrier state can then be further subdivided into inapparent infections with constant shredding and inapparent infections with intermittent shedding. With potentially zoonotic diseases, such as Salmonella, rickettsioses, and psittacosis (Chlamydia psittici), the ability to shed or transmit the organism into the environment or vectors becomes particularly relevant (Evans and Davies, 1996; Gregory and Schaffner, 1997; Raoult and Roux, 1997).",

Animals that are bred for genetic resistance to infection and/or disease will be major factors in disease control in the future (Gavora, 1996; Malo and Skamene, 1994). The utilization of genetic testing is essential for some infections, such as the retroviruses, which serve to activate cellular oncogenes and promote disease.

The predictive value of a positive result may be high when an animal is clinical, such as a cat with FIR However, with early testing the problems of detecting cross-reacting viruses (feline enteric coronaviruses) increases, as does the question of whether the preclinical result accurately identifies an animal that is just infected or will progress onto disease (Evermann et al., 1995; Foley et al., 1997). In infections such as EIA, the consequences of infection are just as severe as the horse that has clinical signs of EIA. This is because the infection is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and all seropositive horses and mules are required to be reported, regardless of their health status. Assays for early detection of EIA infection have been reported to detect viral RNA in plasma samples as early as 48 hours after infection (Langemeier et al., 1996). Similarly in bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the consequences of a positive test result can be economically devastating due to stringent government regulations. This becomes particularly problematic because many tests currently available may cross-react with other mycobacterial species (Essey and Koller, 1994; O'Reilly and Daborn, 1995).",
