Health systems around the globe are struggling to find efficacious treatments against COVID-19 and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous experience with SARS and MERS-CoV infection demonstrated a marked pro-inflammatory response (Th1 and Th17) in patients with ARDS which is also seen in COVID-19 (1) (2) (3) . This evidence has prompted the off-label use of IL-6 inhibitors in severe COVID-19 disease as well as the initiation of randomised clinical trials to test these drugs (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04320615). Additionally, other inflammatory cytokine pathways such as the IL-1 pathway are currently being explored (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04324021).",

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), American College of Rheumatology (ACR), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) have published preliminary guidance in this scenario (7) (8) (9) (10) . EULAR and PRES suggest that patients should discuss treatment discontinuation with their rheumatologists. ACR recommendations also favour to temporarily stop treatment with tDMARDs if exposure to SARS-CoV-2. NICE and ACR advocate the suspension of tDMARDs if COVID-19 is confirmed or suspected with the ACR considering IL-6 inhibitors an exception, which may be continued under specific circumstances. So far, these recommendations are based on expert opinion as there is yet very limited epidemiological evidence on the potential risk conferred by tDMARDs with regards to severe COVID-19 disease complications in patients with rheumatic diseases.",

To our knowledge, this is the largest study outlining the extent of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients treated with tDMARDs to date. Importantly, this study provides additional evidence that rheumatic patients on immunosuppressant therapies are not at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population. The number of confirmed cases in our cohort is comparable to that recently reported from one of the focal regions in Italy (1.2% vs. 1.2%) (11) .

In our rheumatology department, tDMARD treatment discontinuation was performed individually, based on the specific patient characteristics. Of note, in most of the confirmed cases that were not admitted (i.e. normal chest x-ray), treatment was not stopped and all patients completely recovered from the infection. This is in line with the recently published guidelines of the German Society of Rheumatology that in a situation of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR without signs of infection, only recommend a tDMARD pause or delay for 5-6 days (20) .

However, it is possible that comorbidities influence the severity of the disease rather than the probability of infection (24).

There is evidence that RA patients are at an increased risk of infections particularly if they present high disease activity and depending on the concomitant glucocorticoids dose (25) (26) (27) .

This data suggests a protective effect of these two therapies. IL-6 is one of the cytokines more highly expressed in severe forms of COVID-19, and has been associated to the reported cytokine storms (29) . For this reason, IL-6 inhibitors are currently being used in the treatment of severe COVID disease (30) . Our results are in line with a possible protective role of IL-6 inhibition in the progression of disease severity and suggest this could be applied preventively, at earlier stages of the infection (31) . There is preliminary evidence that inhibition of the CD80/86 co-stimulation by abatacept as well as IL-6 inhibition could be useful to treat interstitial lung disease (32, 33) . Moreover, abatacept has been associated with a lower risk of serious infections which adds up as a possible explanation of these findings (34) . Very recently, a case series of 86 COVID-19 affected patients with immunemediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) from New York showed that the percentage of patients treated with tDMARDs (72% of the cohort) was higher in the ambulatory managed patients compared to those that required admission (15) . Despite the small sample size, this study is in line with our findings, supporting the observation that some tDMARDs might have a protective effect. Together, these data should encourage the initiation of well-designed randomised controlled trials to corroborate the protective effect of these treatments in COVID-19.",

First, we designed an observational study based on a telephone survey with different date completion and filled by distinct operators. Patient reporting could have been influenced by the operator and symptoms could have been missed as these could have appeared after the date of completion. To address this potential bias, we reviewed the electronic health records of all patients to detect possible cases and asked all our patients to actively contact us if any of the compatible symptoms occurred. Secondly, we only included rheumatic patients treated with tDMARDs without a control group, either treated with other type of DMARDs or untreated patients. While including also rheumatic patients without these therapies would have also been useful information, the exceptional workload during the lockdown period compelled us to prioritise the group of patients who were initially considered to be the most vulnerable. Thirdly, our study is mainly focused on chronic inflammatory arthritis and we did not include, for example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or giant cell arteritis that could provide additional insights into the protective effect of hydroxychloroquine and anti-IL6 therapies. Further, the lockdown effect might be more pronounced in IMID patients since they are considered an immunosuppressed cohort protecting them from possible exposure to infection and, therefore, distorting their comparison with general population.",

Lastly, due to limited availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing in our setting, the estimate of COVID-19 incidence is inaccurate, thereby prompting the health community to rely on suspect cases definitions that might not precisely identify all cases.",

These data suggest that tDMARDs should not be stopped in these patients during the pandemic. Our study also suggests that tDMARDs show different levels of protection against COVID-19 and supports the development of randomized clinical trials to adequately assess their individual effect. International initiatives currently under way, such as the Global Rheumatology Alliance and the EULAR COVID-19 database will provide invaluable data for rheumatic disease management, but epidemiological studies from large national reference centres can be extremely helpful as an interim guidance (14, 35) . In this unprecedented time, when therapies commonly used in rheumatic diseases could prove useful to manage a pandemic disease, rheumatologists are required to provide all their expertise to accelerate the generation of scientific data to protect the lives of people, not only those affected by rheumatic diseases, but also for the global population.

When exploring the effect of therapies between groups (suspected vs. non-suspected), we found significant differences in tDMARD proportions in adults (p=0.002). CTLA-4-Ig and anti-IL6 treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID-19-compatible symptoms (<5% at the treatment level) among adult rheumatic patients. When restricting this analysis to RA patients only (n=404, 45.1%) -where these two treatments are mainly used-the same trend was observed for both CTLA4-Ig (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.22-2.67) and anti-IL6 (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.08-1.57), although this difference was not statistically significant. Crude ORs for all treatments and disease are presented in supplementary material 2. In the paediatric population, all suspected cases were treated with anti-TNF therapy. However, when comparing to the adult anti-TNF treated sub-group we found no significant difference in risk (p=0.33). As expected, in both adult and paediatric patients, all symptoms were significantly more frequent in the suspected case group and patients had a higher exposure to possible sources of infection with more number of cohabitants (trend test p<0.001) with confirmed COVID-19, cohabitants with compatible symptoms, number of cohabitants with compatible symptoms (trend test p <0.001) and co-workers with confirmed disease or compatible symptoms.",
