Globalization brings effects such as mobile transboundary transportation and new network organizations, human interventions in nature, such as the clearance of primaeval forests to obtain land for agriculture. Today's habitation densities and the predominantly industrial way of life have made people dependent on the technical remodelling of nature and on the development of new technologies, as well as new sources of energy. Goods and services are needed to such an extent that natural resources are constantly diminishing. This has created unknown risks, the complexity of which makes it very difficult to identify and quantify the causal links between a multitude of potential causal agents and the specific effects observed.",

The risks from these new processes and products are not yet very well understood, but exposure to some nanoparticles, a part of nanotechnology, especially the free insoluble particles, have already been shown to affect human health, and wild life as well. The risks arising from molecular manufacturing are so complex that it is difficult to describe the situation well enough yet, as the field of molecular manufacturing is still in the stage of theory. There is currently no global consensus in defining nanotechnology. However, most of the interest in this new technology seems to be in the range of 100 nm to about 0.2 nm. In this range, materials start to change their behaviour due to the increased surface area (catalytic properties), and the dominance of the quantum effect (no longer dominated by Newtonian Laws), which changes the optical, magnetic or electrical properties of materials. In essence, nanotechnological devices exist in a unique realm, sometimes called the mesoscale, where the properties of matter are governed by a complex combination of classic physics and quantum mechanics.",

Nanoparticles have size-induced functional characteristics, making it difficult at present to evaluate how they will behave in the environment or after being incorporated. Artificially produced nanoparticles may enter the environment and the human body through emission during production, or during use of the products. Their behaviour, when spreading out, and their effects are not known nor are their potential long-term consequences. Particularly questions concerning mobility, reaction, readiness, persistence, respirable dust, and solubility, still have to be answered.

Bottom-Up. This means from the bottom (smaller) to the top (larger). Here the assumption is that one starts with a nanometric structure such as a molecule, and through a process of assembly creates a larger mechanism. This form of nanotechnology is more likely to be part of future manufacturing. However, some suggest that the merger of biotechnology, information technology and artificial intelligence with nanotechnology could see advances in this area soon. Nanotubes, which are graphite cylinders with special electric properties, may be the first example of a self-assembled nanostructure.

It is applied in an increasing number of national jurisdictions, economic sectors and environments (Trouwborst 2002 , de Sadeleer 2002 . It has shifted from the regulation of industry, technology and health risks, to the wider governance of science, innovation and trade (O'Riordan and Cameron 1994 , Raffensberger and Tickner 1999 , Harding and Fisher 1999 , O'Riordan et al. 2001 . As it has expanded in scope, it has grown in profile and authority. As Article 174(2) of the EC Treaty of 2002 states, precaution is now the key underlying principle in European Community policy making (European Commission 2002) . In the aftermath of a series of formative public health controversies, economic calamities and political conflicts (such as those involving BSE and GM crops), precaution is of great importance in many sectors, including the regulation of chemicals. Despite the strong political interest, however, a number of serious ambiguities and queries remain. They concern the nature and appropriate role of the precautionary principle in governance (Cross 1996 , Morris 2000 , Majone 2002 , Marchant and Mossman 2004 , L\u00f6fstedt 2004 . These are addressedif not resolved -in lively academic debate (Sand 2000 , Fisher 2001 , Klinke and Renn 2001 , Stirling 2003 , van Zwanenberg and Stirling 2004 , Stirling et al. 2006 , as well as the more policy-oriented literature (Stirling 1999 , Gee et al. 2001 . The precautionary approach has been formulated in numerous ways in many different places: One root may be the \"foresight principle\" in Germany in the 1970s, but the formulation in the Rio Declaration is the most popular one (see Paterson 2005) :",

It uses expected values as the main input for assessing the toleration of risk, as well as for planning risk reduction measures that are cost-effective, proportional to the threat, and fair to the affected population. In this frame, precaution may best be interpreted as being conservative in making risk judgments and in selecting cautious assumptions when one is calculating exposure or determining safety factors (of 10, 100 or more) to cover interindividual variability. \u2022 Within the frame of \"precaution\", the concept of risk is seen from the perspective of pervasive uncertainty and, in particular, ignorance and lack of knowledge. Precautious risk management means the prudent handling of decision options in situations where there is high uncertainty about causes and effects and high vulnerability of the population at risk. Instruments of precaution include minimization requirements (such as ALARA or ALARP 3 ), diversification of risk agents, containment in time and space, and close monitoring. \u2022 The third frame of deliberation has been advocated as an alternative or an addition to the purely analytical procedures of assessing and managing risks. The task of risk management here is to organize in a structured and effective manner the involvement of stakeholders and the inter-ested public in the designing of risk management strategies based on each stakeholder's knowledge (epistemic community) and value system. This strategy can be used together with both the risk analysis and the precautionary approach, but it has been advocated either as an independent path to risk management, or more often as a policy-oriented implementation of the precautionary approach.",

They have accused their critics of ignoring the complexity and uncertainty of most hazardous situations and of relying on data that often turns out to be insufficient for making prudent judgments.

There are, however, isolated examples of community participation in risk decisions, such as in selecting the remedy under the Superfund clean-up program or negotiated rulemaking in the US (Harter 1982 , Coglianese 1997 . In recent years, however, risk policy makers have acknowledged that participation in risk analysis brings many advantages because it transforms difficult issues of resolving epistemic uncertainty into topics that can be tackled at the negotiation table. \"If society participates in the production of policy-relevant scientific knowledge, such 'socially robust' knowledge is less likely to be contested than that which is merely reliable\" (Funtowitz et al. 2000: 333-334) . Accordingly, the EU communication on good governance (2001) has emphasized the need for more stakeholder involvement and participation in risk management. How to implement this requirement in day-to-day risk management decisions is still being debated. Many scholars have also questioned the value of deliberative approaches in some settings, arguing that \"when there is trust in the regulator, a top-down form of risk communication (information transfer) may be better than dialogue\" (L\u00f6fstedt 2005: 3 ; see also Rose-Ackerman 1994, Coglianese 1997).",

Since there are more risks in the world than can ever be handled at the same time, risk management always implies the setting of priorities. The conventional solution to this problem has been to create risk reduction policies in proportion to the severity of the potential effects (Crouch and Wilson 1984) . Severity has been defined as a linear combination of the magnitude of harm and the probability of occurrence. Risk-risk comparisons constitute the most appropriate instrument in this perspective for setting risk management priorities (Merkhofer 1987 , Cohen 1991 . The underlying rationale of this approach is based on the assumption that risk should be reduced in proportion to the expected or modelled harm to humans or ecosystems. This assumption is, however, highly contested in the wider risk community: social actions to cope with risk are not confined to the single goal of risk minimization, but rather include other objectives such as equity, fairness, flexibility, or resilience (Vlek 1996) . The strongest argument against the proportional risk management approach comes from the analysis of uncertainty (Cooke 1991 , van Asselt 2000 . Most risk data consist of aggregate results on large segments of the population over a long time (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1987) .",

The first two components of uncertainty qualify as epistemic uncertainty and can therefore be reduced by augmenting the existing knowledge and by advancing the present modelling tools. The last three components are genuine uncertainty components of aleatory nature, and thus can be characterized to some extent by using scientific approaches, but cannot be further reduced to probabilities. If uncertainty, particularly the aleatory components, plays a big role, then the estimation of risk becomes fuzzy. Accordingly, the validity of the end results is questionable, and additional information is needed for risk management purposes. This necessary information can be e.g. a subjective confidence level in the risk estimates, potential alternative pathways of cause-effect relationships, ranges of reasonable estimates, loss scenarios, and others. Based on the distinction between epistemic and aleatory uncertainty, it is possible to design generic strategies of risk management to be applied to classes of risks, thus simplifying the risk management process as outlined above. One can distinguish four such classes: simple risk problems -complex risk problems -risk problems due to high unresolved uncertainty -risk problems due to interpretative and normative ambiguity.",

With the advent of new participatory methods, the two issues of inclusion and selection have become more complex and sophisticated, compared to the conventional strategies of decision analysis. Our understanding of risk governance includes the notion that the four major actors in making risk decisions, i.e. the political, economic (business), scientific and civil society players need to be involved in the process of problem framing, generating and evaluating options, and coming to a joint conclusion.

Inclusive governance needs to address the second part of the decision-making process as well, i.e. reaching closure on a set of options that are selected for further consideration, while others are rejected. Closure does not imply reaching a \"final say\" on an initiative or regulation. Rather, it represents the outcome of a deliberation, i.e. the agreement that the participants reached. The problem is that the more actors, viewpoints, interests and values that are represented in an arena, the more difficult it is to reach either a consensus or some other joint agreement.

It is not sufficient to gather all interested parties around a table and rest all hopes in some kind of cathartic effect. In particular, it is essential to consider the investment of time and effort on the part of participating actors as scarce resources that need to be handled with respect. The participation process should be designed in such a way that the various actors are encouraged to contribute to the process on all issues in which they feel they are competent and can offer something to improve the quality of the final result. Figure 5 .2 provides an overview of the different requirements for participation and stakeholder involvement for the different management strategies. As with all classifications, the scheme gives an extremely simplified picture of the involvement process. Categorizing different threats according to the quality and nature of the available information will, of course, be contested among the stakeholders.

In this regard, it is useful to refer again to the main challenges to risk as outlined in Chapters 1 and 3. This required, first and foremost, that any proposed new framework for the articulation of conventional and more precautionary approaches in an area such as occupational health and safety should display enhanced compliance with the European Commission's own principles of \"good governance\". These comprised: participation and accountability; accessibility and openness; coherence and consistency; proportionality and non-discrimination; and effectiveness, timeliness and subsidiarity. Second, it was argued that compliance with these governance criteria requires a high degree of specificity over the way in which an appropriate balance may be struck between the roles played by different interests, constituencies, disciplines, methods, institutions and modes of engagement. Third, the initial conceptual discussion showed more specifically that the framework should (in addition to the conditions of \"risk\" and \"complexity\" addressed in established approaches to \"risk analysis\"), fully engage with the distinct, intractable and somewhat neglected problems of \"complexity\", \"uncertainty\", and \"ambiguity\".",

            "text": "A similar distinction has been made by Stirling (2003) . One of the main conclusions of our analysis in this section has been that using precaution for the first two cases is neither necessary nor prudent, given that regulations need to meet both objectives, namely, protection of workers and public health, as well as of the environment. Precaution can be used legitimately in the case of ignorance or other forms of remaining uncertainties (such as system boundaries or truly stochastic events). In order to avoid misunderstanding, some analysts have proposed to avoid the term precaution and replace it with the more adequate term of principle of insufficient reason (see Peterson 2003: 71) . This is the place where precaution is required. The main purpose of precaution in this respect is to avoid irreversible decisions. Although highly critical about the use of the precautionary principle, policy analyst G. Majone conceded that the precautionary principle does have a role, namely, where \"losses (or utilities) are unbounded\" and where it is \"clearly impossible to calculate expected values\", e.g., where there is a threat of \"serious and irreversible damage\" (Majone 2002: 104) . In this Chapter we made a strong plea for screening chemical risks according to the degree of remaining uncertainties, and then using those risk reduction methods that are most suited for the type of risk under scrutiny. Charnley and Elliott have argued that regulatory decisions, whether in the US or the EU, involve both a factual component (\"how great do we think that the risk of harm is?\") and a value or policy component (\"are we willing to accept the risks, including the unknown risks?\") (Charnley and Elliott 2002) . What changes from one decision to another decision are the relative weights assigned to each component. There is widespread perception on both sides of the Atlantic that Europe tends to place more weight on the second component (acceptability), whereas many US agencies, under the pressure to build a record for judicial review, tend to place more emphasis on the first component (extent of demonstrated risk). One should note, however, that there is little actual empirical evidence supporting these stereotypes, and there are wide variations within and among agencies in the USA and Europe. For example, the now-repealed Delaney clause banning any carcinogens in US food safety regulation was certainly inspired by a strong link to the value component and precaution, while traffic safety regulation in most European countries is clearly guided by risk assessments.",

Elliot has suggested that this problem becomes more tractable when viewed diachronically (over time) rather than analysing what relative weights should properly be given to facts (risk) and values (precaution) synchronically and in the abstract (Elliott 1992) . Thus, the practical question that every regulator must ask is: \"Shall I act to address this particular problem now, basing my decision on what is currently known (or more accurately, believed to be known), or shall I instead defer action until a later date, when more may be known, but at the cost of what occurs in the meantime\"? Viewed from this practical, diachronic perspective, which is the situation that a regulator actually faces in trying to decide on concrete actions, the problem of the relative weights to be assigned to fact (risk) and to value (precaution) may become much more tractable. As a matter of common sense, a regulator may be well-advised to wait until later to act if, but only if, (1) it seems unlikely that much preventable harm will occur in the meantime, but (2) it also seems likely that enough useful information will be developed in the meantime, so that making a better decision in the future will be substantially less difficult than it is today. Because these quantities are incommensurable (i.e. they exist in different realms and implicate different values), and because they involve predictions about the future, they cannot be reduced to a precise formula. But it may nonetheless be helpful to frame the issues in this way, because there are many \"easy cases\" in which it is clear that the harm that may occur in the meantime is far greater than any likely benefit that may result from waiting for more information, and vice versa.",
