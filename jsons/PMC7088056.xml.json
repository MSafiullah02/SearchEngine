Moreover, there have been some recent reports which reveal the interaction of lycorine with DNA and tRNA [11, 12], and recently it has been identified as anti-SARS-CoV component [13]. It has, therefore, been to the interest of phytochemists to determine the content of this alkaloid in Amaryllidaceaous plants.",

Standard solutions were applied in the form of bands on pre-coated HPTLC silica gel plates 60 F-254 (20 \u00d7 10 cm with 250 \u03bcm thickness) by means of Linomat IV automated spray-on band applicator. The volumes applied for routine analysis were duplicate 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 \u03bcL of the TLC lycorine standard (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 \u03bcg) and duplicate 2 \u03bcL aliquots of sample solution. The mobile phase consisted of chloroform: methanol (9:1) and 25 mL of mobile phase were used per development. Ascending development of the plates was carried out in 20 \u00d7 20 cm Camag HPTLC twin trough chamber saturated with the mobile phase. The optimized chamber saturation time for the mobile phase was 30 min at room temperature. Plates were developed to a distance of 7 cm beyond the origin. The development time was 11 min. After development, the plates were air-dried for 5 min. Densitometric scanning was performed on Camag TLC scanner III in the reflectance-fluorescence mode at 368 nm and operated by CATS TLC software (version 4.X) and using the optical filter K400. The source of radiation utilized was deuterium lamp emitting a continuous UV spectrum between 190 and 400 nm. The slit dimension was kept at 6 \u00d7 0.1 mm.",

It is simpler than HPLC and faster because up to six samples (applied in duplicate singly with a minimum of three standard concentrations) can be analyzed on each plate rather than performing sequential injection of the samples and standards in HPLC. Cost of solvent purchase and disposal is very low because no more than 15 mL of mobile phase for development is required in the chamber trough containing the plate, and an additional 10 mL for vapor saturation in the other trough. The processing of samples and standards together at the same time (in-system calibration) leads to improved reproducibility and accuracy.",
