Then, following the example of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, a cytopathologist-run fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy clinic was established. Thus, since 1976, cytopathologists have been performing FNAs by themselves, ensuring correct sample management, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) and, more recently, ultrasound guidance. This activity, carried out for more than four decades, is now being challenged by the extraordinary outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in Italy.1 Our country has overtaken China as the nation with the most coronavirus-related deaths. From the epicentre, located in the north of the country, the disease is spreading more towards south, also involving the crowded Naples, the third-largest city of Italy after Rome and Milan.",

Italians transformed their lives. Accordingly, also our practice of cytopathology changed. Due to the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens, we adopted more stringent safety procedures, according to recent recommendations.3\u20137 A policy of sample prioritisation was also implemented. While cytological screening activities were reasonably postponed, our cytology laboratory continued to function providing the best possible service to (potential) oncological patients. As a result, rate of malignancy increased. How long this pandemic will last is uncertain. However, we argue that in all cases, featuring a not negligible risk of a malignant disease, the cytological examination may be safely carried out without the need to be postponed.",

This allows accurate disinfection and sterilisation and nurse rotation. Working in pairs, cytopathologists are faster, thus limiting the time spent in the clinic by each patient. Staff wear personal protective masks with a filter respirator and face shields to protect the eyes. T t As a general rule, smears are ethanol fixed to avoid that fluid and tissue materials obtained by FNA, expelled onto slides and allowed to dry, generated aerosols and droplets; these latter might contain viable and transmissible viruses. Lymph nodes smears are still air-dried as ROSE is needed to triage for flow cytometry or cell-block preparation. Safety procedures are also mandatory in laboratory when processing body fluids. These should be received, instead than fresh, ethanol fixed to ensure adequate virus inactivation. Finally, our informed consent form was changed to allow the possibility for the patient to receive the final diagnostic report by email.",
