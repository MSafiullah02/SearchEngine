In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, only urgent endoscopy acts are performed, whereas COVID-19 dedicated medical and critical care units are mobilized. We report herein on how a mobile Parisian on-call endoscopy team (POET) performs urgent endoscopy acts outside regular hours, by means of a portable equipment, in a dense urban area (6.7 million inhabitants within 762 km 2 ), hence allowing the most effective use of manpower where and when needed.",

We decided to extend the outreach of POET (usually within the Paris city limits) to the whole Greater Paris area. POET is based in the Saint-Antoine Hospital located in Paris where reprocessing and equipment storage take place. The team comprises, for each round of interventions, a senior physician and a paramedic, both specialized in endoscopy. These caregivers are used in one of the APHP hospitals and have clearance to perform urgent acts in all the critical care units of these hospitals. Therefore, patients from outside hospitals or clinics in the greater Paris area are transferred for endoscopy in one of these APHP sites. The mobile team is equipped with a 7kg portable processor (Telepack X GI, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), 3 endoscopes (GI Silver Scope Series, Karl Storz), a 4-kg portable power source (Vio 100C, Erbe, Tuebingen, Germany), and ancillary tools (Fig. 1) , carried on a foldable moving cart (Fig. 2) .",
