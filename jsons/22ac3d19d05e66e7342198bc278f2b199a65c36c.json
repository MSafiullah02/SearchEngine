The major factors contributing to CUB are evolutionary forces, compositional properties, gene expression, and protein properties. The present analysis was performed to investigate the compositional properties and the extent of CUB across the genomes of members of the family Hepadnaviridae, as previously no work using bioinformatic tools has been reported. The viral genes were found to be AT rich with low CUB. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was used to identify overrepresented and underrepresented codons for each amino acid. Correlation analysis of overall nucleotide composition and its composition at the third codon position suggested that mutation pressure might influence the CUB. A highly significant correlation was observed between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.910, p < 0.01), indicating that directional mutation affected all three codon positions across the genome. Translational selection (P2) and mutational responsive index (MRI) values of genes suggested that mutation plays a more important role than translational selection in members of the family Hepadnaviridae.",

In the standard genetic code, a set of 61 codons encodes the 20 standard amino acids. Other than tryptophan and methionine, all amino acids are represented by more than one codon, resulting in codon redundancy. The condition of biased usage of some codons preferentially over other synonymous codons is known as codon usage bias (CUB), and it is specific for every genome [3, 29, 30, 53] . CUB differs among genomes as well as within the same genome, and studying these differences may help us to understand genome evolution among related species [66] as well as the relationship between host cells and viruses or immune reactions [62] .",

In the neutral theory, mutational pressure at degenerate positions of a codon must be neutral, such that there is nonuniform usage of synonymous codons for a specific amino acid, indicating a lack of natural selection [48] . The level of gene expression has been shown to be associated with CUB [63, 64] , whereas the selection-mutation-drift model postulates the importance of genetic drift, mutation pressure, and natural selection in the establishment of CUB [63, 64] . Natural selection of highly expressed genes can play an important role [31] , and influences codon usage in various organisms [25] . Other notable determinants of innate CUB are base composition [5] , skewness of bases [10] , expression level of the gene [77] , gene length [17] , gene stability, replication [25, 39] , translational selection [56] , protein secondary structure [77] and hydrophobicity [13] . A previous study showed that variation in the tRNA pool and disparity in isochores of a cell are major determinants of CUB [4, 16] .",

In order to identify differences in the codon usage pattern across the genomes, we performed a correspondence analysis (CA) of the RSCU values of the 59 sense codons across the genomes (Fig. 5 ). In the figure, axis 1 and axis 2 are the two major contributors to the total variation. A green dot on the figure represents AT-ending codons, and a red dot indicates GC-ending codons. The figure shows a close distribution of the bases across the axes, suggesting that mutational pressure might have influenced the CUB of the genes, supporting the results reported by Wei et al. [80] . Cluster analysis was done with Past software, using the RSCU values of the 59 sense codons of each genome. These results, along with the findings of CA, revealed two major clusters (Fig. 6 ). Seven hepadnavirus genomes were found in one cluster, and 10 genomes were found in another cluster, indicating a close evolutionary relationship within each cluster. ",

This suggests that energy is released during the transcription process, resulting in a more stable conformation.

In the present study, the mean ENC value was low, indicating that there is little bias in codon usage in members of the family Hepadnaviridae [10] . A lack of strong CUB is expected to promote efficient usage of more codons and thereby speed up the translation process [32] . Fu reported a lower ENC value in five members of the Herpesviridae family of DNA viruses than in other members of the family [19] . Similarly, the ENC value of 11 human bocavirus isolates was in the range of 40.87 to 48.42, with a mean value 44.45, indicating low CUB [91] . However, low ENC values implying high bias have been reported in several viruses, including Orgyia pseudotsugata nucleopolyhedrovirus and Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus [33] . Lower CUB might relate to efficient replication in different cell types with different codon preferences [32] .",

Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.910, p < 0.01), suggesting a directional role of mutation. High mutation pressure leads to evolution. Most viruses have a high evolutionary rate due to large population size, high mutation rate, and short generation time. Viral mutations arise from errors made during replication of the viral genome. The mutation rate is used to determine the amount of genetic variation within a population, and this allows natural selection to operate [51] .

Coding sequences with a low mFE value are weakly folded, and coding sequences with high mFE value are strongly folded. Coding sequences with low mFE values tend to produce more protein than those with high mFE values because strong secondary structure in the mRNA molecule disfavors translation.

The mRNA stability index is another parameter that was used in our analysis to estimate mRNA stability. Our results showed that seven genomes had a positive value (highly stable mRNA), while nine genomes had a negative value (less stable mRNA). A significant correlation was found between the stability index and base composition in hepadnavirus genomes. As the stability of the mRNA molecule has been found to be related to the stability of the protein [27] , the stability of gene products can be predicted using the mRNA stability index for the expressed genes.

The results of P2 and MRI analysis were further supported by the neutrality plot analysis, i.e., mutation pressure was found to play a predominant role in hepadnavirus genomes.",

The overall codon usage bias across the genomes was low, indicating high variability in synonymous codon usage in viral genes. Almost equal usage of T, A and C was found, which differed from that of G, and AT richness was found. Three overrepresented codons (TCT, AGA, GGA) and seven underrepresented codons (TCG, AGC, AGT, CCG, CGA, ACG, GCG) were identified. Both mutational pressure and natural selection appear to have shaped the codon usage pattern of genes in hepadnavirus genomes during evolution.",
