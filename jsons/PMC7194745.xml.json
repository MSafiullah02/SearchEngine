            "text": "On average 5.3 viruses per year, of which 60%\u201370% are human pathogens, have emerged from 1940 to 2004 [1]. In a rapidly evolving pandemic, therapeutic options must be available quickly. Use of convalescent plasma transfusions could be of great value in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), given the lack of specific preventative and therapeutic options. This convalescent plasma therapy is of particular interest when a vaccine or specific therapy is not yet available for emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Response to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases throughout history has included rapid scientific collaborations to develop specific vaccines or therapies. To that end, currently, there is a large global trial supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), SOLIDARITY, to investigate existing therapies for COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir, and lopinavir + ritonavir + interferon-beta. In addition, there is broad interest to leverage convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients as treatment or for prophylaxis of health care workers and other caregivers. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has released guidance for investigation of convalescent plasma in the United States for COVID-19 [2]. Additionally, historic data has reported safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma for use in other infectious diseases, and there is also new data on convalescent plasma use in the current global public health emergency specifically to treat COVID-19.",

Ling Lin et al. hypothesize that the virus first attacks the organs in patients that express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and that there is a second attack around 7\u201314 days after symptom onset. [23] The virus may cause B lymphocyte reduction (and IL-6 reduction) early in the disease, which may affect antibody production. Lymphocytes may continue to decline over the course of disease, and inflammatory cytokines increase. Hence, therapies should focus on 1) enhancement of the immune function of patients and 2) inhibiting the formation of inflammatory cytokine storms. Additional data on pathogenesis and immune response will inform further development of improved convalescent plasma as well as development of vaccines and other therapies.",

In this pilot study, 9 patients received 1 dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody titers of >1:640. The median time from onset of illness to convalescent plasma transfusion was 16.5 days. Within 3 days, the patients showed improved clinical symptoms along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation. Lymphocyte counts increased from 0.65 \u00d7 109/L to 0.76 \u00d7 109/mL and C-reactive protein decreased from 55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L.

Two widely used examples of PRT include the INTERCEPT Blood System (Cerus) and the Mirasol PRT System (Terumo BCT) and are briefly reviewed here [40]. In the United States, the INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets is approved to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections from platelet transfusions. The Mirasol PRT System is currently undergoing a clinical study under an IDE with the US FDA for the treatment of platelets. Both of these PRTs are used for treatment of plasma in some countries outside of the United States.",
