One of its three R&D and innovation programs aims in particular to provide the technological tools and bricks necessary for the development of the Autonomous Train. This Autonomous Train program will thus address signaling, control-command, driving and railway operating systems. The Autonomous Freight Train project under the Autonomous Train program with the cooperation of several partners (\"SNCF\", \"ALSTOM\", \"Hitachi Rail STS France\", \"ALTRAN\" and \"APSYS\") targets performance improvements of the system thanks to the implementation of autonomy in railways operations. This system is classified as Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and depends more and more on effective solutions that can address heterogeneity and interplay of physical and software elements. In particular, modeling languages used for specifying CPS should incorporate, in a consistent manner, the essential concepts from multiple engineering disciplines that take part in the design of such systems.",

Thus, formal specifications are needed in order to guarantee the consistency and the completeness of architecture models specification.",

            "text": "Several architecture modeling languages have been proposed to reason about heterogeneous properties of CPS, and assessing multidisciplinary design languages. The authors of paper [1] propose an approach to combine SysML [2] and AADL [3] . These formalisms are two modeling languages specified for designing Integrated Control Systems (ICSs). These languages have been standardized but none of them provides the full range required to deal effectively with more general kinds of complex systems like CPS. In fact, SysML supports requirements engineering, traceability, and modeling of diverse physical phenomena. On the other hand, AADL is oriented to model real-time embedded systems. It provides software-to-hardware bindings allowing analyses of different system properties such as performance, timing, etc. This combination consists in extending SysML using the UML extension mechanism profiles to cover all AADL concepts and is called Extended SysML for Architecture Analysis Modeling (ExSAM). This approach allows to design high-level architectures of complex systems. However, in this approach only semi-formal graphical models can be produced and thus no formal verification can be carried out. Furthermore, they do not permit to specify alignment links that can be used to ensure the compliance of architecture models with system requirements. Authors in [5] proposes a multi approach for real-time systems specification and design. The purpose of the work is to couple MARTE [4] with the Event-B method. Papers [6] and [7] consider a meaningful subset of AADL which allows to specify respectively a class of embedded control systems and AADL data port protocols, and assign this subset a semantics in terms of Event-B refinements and model decomposition. Despite these approaches provide formal specifications, they do not consider high-level architectures but propose a temporal model of tasks execution on GPU.",

[9] and [10] present an approach which aims to combine requirements engineering methods with formal methods. The main idea is to specify goal models by using a SysML-based language [2] extended with concepts of the KAOS goal language [8] , to specify domain models by using an ontology-based language, and then to map them into an Event-B specification. However, these methods are just concerned by requirements models and do not provide formalism to specify system architecture models.",

The method needs to be multiviews: graphical in order to be validated by all the stakeholders and formal in order to verify both architecture models and their compliance with system requirements. This is a three-steps method based on the MDE approach shown in Fig. 1 . In the first step, we propose to combine three graphical modeling languages: SysML, AADL and MARTE, in order to provide the full range required to deal effectively with Autonomous Freight Train concerns such as timing properties, non-functional properties, software-to-hardware bindings, etc. The second step consists in formalizing the concepts of the graphical language with Event-B in order to obtain an Event-B specification of architecture models. Thus their correctness and consistency can be proved. We have chosen the Event-B method since it is a formal method, widely used in industry, based on refinement and decomposition mechanisms and supported by tools (provers, model-checkers, animators...). In the final step, we propose to specify alignment links between requirements models and high-level architecture models in order to prove that all the industrial stakeholders requirements are satisfied by highlevel architecture models. We will reuse the SysML/KAOS method to produce requirements models (goal and domain models) and the corresponding Event-B specifications.",
