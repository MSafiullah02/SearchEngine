Increasing age (incremental years) at hospital admission was significantly associated with death after discharge (hazard ratio 1.078). Recurrence of NSE was recorded in 49/211 (23%) horses.

Dorsopalmar foot radiographs were acquired while varying the lateromedial stance; and variable angle horizontal beam dorsopalmar foot radiographs were acquired while keeping the limb position constant. Analyses of measurements demonstrated that hoof pastern angle had a linear relationship with craniocaudal stance of the horse. The relationship of joint angle and stance was greater for the distal interphalangeal joint angle than the proximal interphalangeal joint angle. The distal phalanx angle did not change with craniocaudal stance variation. The proximal interphalangeal joint width, distal interphalangeal joint width, or distal phalanx height did not change with lateromedial stance variation, nor within a 15 degree dorsolateral to caudomedial and dorsomedial to caudolateral variation from the dorsopalmar axis. These findings show that positioning of the thoracic limb should be considered during radiographic interpretation and decision-making for corrective farriery.",

Horses were treated six times over a period of 20 weeks with 50-100 g of barley grain each time, up to 400 g in total. Eight months after the last treatment, horses were all 'boosted' with 100 g of barley. Blood and saliva were collected from the horses before and 2 weeks after each treatment and tested with an ELISA for IgG antibodies to two Culicoides proteins. After the transgenic barley treatment, three of four horses showed an IgG1 response and all four horses were successfully boosted, significantly different from controls. A competitive inhibition ELISA showed that after the boost, transgenic barley-treated horses' sera inhibited binding of IgE to one of the Culicoides proteins. A further competitive inhibition ELISA showed that the two proteins are not fully cross-reactive. These results show that the transgenic barley is effective at inducing an allergen-specific response and that antibodies produced are able to partially inhibit IgE binding to allergens from Culicoides species. Further study is warranted as an immunotherapy treatment for insect bite hypersensitivity.",

The greatest amplitude of dorsoventral movement (119 AE 14 mm in straight lines vs. 126 AE 20 mm in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater flexionextension ROM (>1.3\u00b0), lateral bending (>16\u00b0), and lateral motion (>16 mm) compared with straight lines. Circles induced a movement pattern similar to an inside hindlimb lameness, which was significantly associated with the circle-induced greater asymmetry of dorsoventral movement of the thoracolumbar region.
