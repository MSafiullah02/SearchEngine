There are many reasons why these species are endangered, but there are four main factors: overexploitation, loss of habitat, invasive species, and disease spread by invasive species (Wilson et al. 1992) . Consumption of wildlife for food is one of the main components of the over-exploitation of wildlife resources. Wildlife was the major source of protein for early human beings (Roosevelt 1996) . However, with the establishment of modern animal husbandry, human beings no longer need wildlife meat as a source of protein. In most inhabited areas of the Earth, people still consume considerable amounts of wild meat. Today, except for forested and savanna areas, relatively few large mammals remain for humans to hunt (Redford & Robinson 1991; Redford 1992; Bennett 2002) , so people turn to amphibians and reptiles. Over-exploitation is the main cause of the decline of amphibians in southern China (Stuart et al. 2004) . During the last decade of the 20th century, China shifted from the country that exported the most snakes to the country that imported the most snakes. The main reasons were the depletion of domestic snake populations due to increased consumption (Zhou & Jiang 2004 , 2005 . The depletion of amphibian and reptile populations also stimulated illegal international smuggling of amphibians, snakes, and turtles (Li & Li 1998; Ades et al. 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 81, "text": "(Chen & Le 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 82, "end": 92, "text": "Wang 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 93, "end": 103, "text": "Zhao 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 104, "end": 120, "text": "Zhen & Wang 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 306, "end": 326, "text": "(Wilson et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 504, "end": 520, "text": "(Roosevelt 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 844, "end": 869, "text": "(Redford & Robinson 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 870, "end": 883, "text": "Redford 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 884, "end": 897, "text": "Bennett 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1046, "text": "(Stuart et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1313, "text": "(Zhou & Jiang 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1320, "text": ", 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1471, "text": "(Li & Li 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1489, "text": "Ades et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "With outbreaks of infectious diseases emerging, we have learned to expect the unexpected (Gill 1991 (Gill , 2001 Normile & Enserink 2003; Pearson et al. 2003) .

In the present study we found that after the SARS and bird flu epidemics, the number of people who consumed wild meats decreased. When they were asked why they did not eat wild meats, many people stated that they were concerned about uninspected wild meat being contaminated with pathogens and feared that they might contract infectious diseases. People began to be more cautious about consuming wild animals.

The list of animals commonly consumed includes bushmeat, that is, that caught in the field without having undergone inspection or quarantine. We chose wild animals that can be found in local markets for the survey. Snakes and frogs are commonly consumed, although our investigation shows that consumption of reptiles and amphibians is declining. A considerable proportion of reptiles and amphibians are now imported. Large mammals like monkeys and bears are rare, so few people have eaten them. International trade of wildlife may be a way of spreading disease (Bell et al. 2004 ); therefore, quarantine of imported wildlife and wildlife products is very important. Many wildlife species in China are protected; therefore, enforcing wildlife protection laws will solve part of the problem. However, changing dietary habits is also important, so last year the Chinese Wildlife Protection Society launched a movement they dubbed A million cooks sign for not cooking wildlife meat. The impacts of such activities are far-reaching. Many non-governmental and media organizations are also campaigning for the protection of wild animals.
