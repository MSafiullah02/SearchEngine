SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human, similar to SARS-CoV [6] . ACE2 belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme family and catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. ACE2 is enriched in the epithelia of lung [7] , while single-cell RNA-seq data analysis of ACE2 expression reveals potential risks of more human organs vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [8] . In reproductive system, single-cell transcriptomes of adult human testis showed high expression of ACE2 in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells [9] . Coronaviruses are prone to mutation and recombination due to their error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [10] , and virus variation may allow some subtypes of the virus to better bind to the receptor ACE2. Therefore, it is very important to reveal how ACE2 expression is regulated for both prevention and treatment of the infectious diseases caused by these coronaviruses in the future.",

Since the N-terminal of histone is exposed to the surface of nucleosome, histone can undergo dynamic chemical modifications including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination [11] . Methylation of H3 lysine residues such as K4, K9, K27 and K36 are intensively studied because of their high correlationship with transcriptional activity. K-to-M mutants of histone H3.3 play a dominant-negative role to suppress specific histone H3 methylation and are valuable tools for screening regulatory pattern of gene expression. During mammalian embryonic development, H3K27me3 is associated with transcriptional silencing and is involved in repressing key developmental genes during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. H3K27me3 is catalyzed by the polycomb group (PcG), a group of conserved transcriptional gene repressors. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2) is a human homologue of enhancer of zeste in drosophila and the key member of PcG [12, 13] , which is composed of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes [14] . EZH2 encodes the catalytic subunit of PRC2 and functions as a histone methyltransferase of H3K27 dimethylation and trimethylation [15] for silencing at specific genomic loci [16] . In ESCs, EZH2mediated H3K27me3 is necessary for cell identity and cell differentiation [17] .",

However, the levels of cleavage embryonic genes (Fig. 2g) and pluripotent factors (Fig. 2h) were not influenced after EZH2 knockout [24] , supporting that change of ACE2 expression was not caused by cell fate change.

In order to determine whether EZH2 inhibits ACE2 expression by mediating histone modifications, we analyzed ChIPseq data of wildtype, EZH2-deficient and EZH2 add-back human ESCs. ChIP-seq analysis showed that H3K27me3 level was decreased at ACE2 promoter region after EZH2 was knocked out [24] (Fig. 3a) . Meanwhile, there was a significant increase of acetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) levels at ACE2 promoter in EZH2deficient ESCs [24] (Fig. 3b) , supporting an antagonism between H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation. In agreement with above result, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac at ACE2 promoter were reestablished upon EZH2 restoration [24] (Fig. 3a and b) . H3K4me1 (Fig. 3c) and H3K4me3 (Fig. 3d ) levels at ACE2 promoter area were also examined and no obvious change was observed upon EZH2 disruption [24] , which indicated no crosstalk between H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation at ACE2 promoter. Taken together, our analysis demonstrates that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 inhibits ACE2 expression.",

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infect human respiratory epithelial cells through the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2, and only cells expressing ACE2 can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [25] .

SARS-CoV-2 may target multiple organs in the human body, causing various organ dysfunctions. The digestive system and other human organs including heart is a potential route of 2019-nCov infection based on single-cell RNA-seq data analysis on the receptor ACE2 expression [8, 26] . ACE2 Expression in cholangiocytes, kidney and testis may cause liver, kidney and testis damage after SARS-CoV-2 Infection [27, 28] . ACE2 encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, a key molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS). ACE2 is mainly composed of two domains. Its N-terminus is a zinc metallopeptidase domain similar to that of ACE. Its C-terminal domain is more conserved with collectrin, a non-catalytic protein involved in amino acid reabsorption in kidney and pancreatic b-cell proliferation. ACE2 is an important candidate gene for pathogenicity in a hypertensive rat model [29] . Therefore, ACE2 may be a potential target for the treatment of hypertension. ACE2 also plays an important role in maintaining normal heart function, and cardiac dysfunction was identified in Ace2-depleted mice [30] . People with high level of ACE2 may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and get more severe symptoms. The expression level of ACE2 in the lung is positively correlated with smoking, which explained partly that the smokers, most of whom are medium-elderly, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [31] . Meanwhile, there is no difference observed in the expression level of ACE2 between male and female. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 did not differ significantly in ACE2 highly expressed tissues between different races, which suggested regulatory mode of ACE2 expression applies to different races including Asian, African and European [32] . Moreover, ACE2 expression was significantly higher in adipose tissue (including subcutaneous fat and visceral fat) and some specific tumor tissues than in the lung, which suggested that obese population and certain types of cancer are more susceptible to the new coronavirus [33] .",
