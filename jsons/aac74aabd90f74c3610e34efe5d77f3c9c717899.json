However, it is now known that HCoVs can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals [9] . The study of HCoVs has been hampered by the difficulty in propagating these viruses in vitro and the lack of specific diagnostic tests with which to identify potentially novel viruses. Therefore, the possibility exists that unidentified HCoVs are the cause of some proportion of the respiratory tract diseases for which etiological agents have not been identified.",

            "text": "To determine whether novel HCoVs are circulating and, if so, whether they are responsible for respiratory tract disease in children, we developed a strategy to screen for previously unknown HCoVs. Our initial assumption was that all CoVs must have conserved functions and that these conserved functions are reflected in the genome. The replicase of CoVs is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the function of which is not provided by the host cell and, therefore, must be evolu-tionarily maintained by all CoVs. Therefore, we designed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes that target regions of the CoV replicase 1a gene that are conserved among HCoVs, avian CoVs, and mammalian CoVs. Using this approach, we identified genetic evidence of a novel HCoV circulating in New Haven, CT. Probes specific for this HCoV, designated \"New Haven coronavirus\" (HCoV-NH), were then used to screen specimens from the respiratory tracts of symptomatic children. During our screening of respiratory specimens for this HCoV, 2 studies from The Netherlands reported the identification of a novel HCoV [10, 11] . This virus is a group 1 CoV and is most closely related to HCoV-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a virus of pigs. Comparisons of the sequences of the HCoV identified in The Netherlands and HCoV-NH revealed that these viruses are closely related and likely represent the same species. Here, we describe the seasonal distribution and clinical manifestation of disease associated with HCoV-NH infection.",

The replicase 1a genes from avian infectious bronchitis virus (GenBank accession number AJ311317), bovine CoV (BCoV) strain LUN (GenBank accession number AF391542), BCoV strain Quebec (GenBank accession number AF220295), BCoV isolate BCoV-ENT (GenBank accession number AF391541), HCoV-229E (GenBank accession number NC_ 002645), TGEV (GenBank accession number NC_002306), and SARS-CoV TOR2 (GenBank accession number AY274119) were aligned by use of Clustal W in the Lasergene software package (version 5.05; DNASTAR). Two conserved regions were identified, and primers corresponding to these regions were synthesized (Yale Oligonucleotide Laboratory, Department of Pathology, New Haven, CT). The forward primer, 5 -GCGCAA-AATAATGAATTAATGCC-3 (underscoring indicates a G/C clamp), and the reverse primer, 5 -GACGCACCACCATATGA-ATCCTG-3 , represent consensus sequences of conserved regions within the 3 1000 bases of the replicase 1a gene of all of the CoVs listed above (relative to sequences 11,781-12,285 of HCoV-229E). The predicted length of the amplicons produced by these primers is \u223c550 bp. RNA from respiratory specimens obtained from the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital, was extracted by use of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA for each respiratory specimen was synthesized with random hexamer primers and MuMLV RT (New England Biolabs), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were subsequently screened by PCR with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The following amplification program was used: 15 min at 95\u040aC; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u040aC, 1 min at 50\u040aC, and 1 min at 72\u040aC; and a final extension of 10 min at 72\u040aC. For the initial screening of respiratory specimens, RNA was extracted from MRC-5 cells infected with HCoV-229E (ATCC VR-740) as a positive control. Each set of RT-PCR amplifications included appropriate negative controls. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After the initial screening of respiratory specimens, amplicons of the predicted molecular weight were isolated and sequenced. Sequencing was performed by use of Applied Biosystems 377 DNA automated sequencers (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Lab, Yale University School of Medicine). Sequences that corresponded to a potential novel HCoV were identified, and primers specific for this agent were synthesized. The forward primer, 5 -GCGCTAT-GAGGGTGGTTGTAAC-3 , and the reverse primer, 5 -CGCG-CAGTTAAAAGTCCAGAATTAAC-3 , amplify a 215-bp region of the novel HCoV genome. These primers target regions of the novel HCoV genome that are distinct relative to the corresponding region of the HCoV-229E genome. Screening by PCR with these primers was performed by use of the following amplification program: 15 min at 95\u040aC; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u040aC, 1 min at 55\u040aC, and 1 min at 72\u040aC; and a final extension of 10 min at 72\u040aC.

We chose to screen specimens that were obtained from the respiratory tracts of symptomatic children !5 years old and that tested negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, and adenovirus by direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA). These specimens, which were obtained from both ambulatory and hospitalized patients, were screened for presence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) by use of an RT-PCR-based approach described elsewhere [12, 13] and were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital, for diagnostic testing. Specimens were obtained from 1 January 2002 to 14 February 2003. Children could be counted more than once if the specimens were obtained 130 days apart. Clinical data from the children who tested positive for HCoV-NH were obtained by extracting information from medical records and recording the data on a standardized form. Children who had evidence of infection with another viral respiratory pathogen were excluded when the clinical features associated with HCoV-NH infection were tabulated. Comorbidity was defined as prematurity (gestational age of !35 weeks), underlying pulmonary disease, genetic syndromes, acquired immunosuppression, malignancies, and congenital heart disease. The Yale University Human Investigations Committee approved the collection and screening of respiratory specimens. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The amplicon of each specimen that tested positive by RT-PCR was sequenced to confirm the presence of HCoV-NH.

This type of genome-based screening has been used previously to identify human bacterial pathogens by targeting conserved elements of rRNA [14] . After the observation of CoV-like particles in re- spiratory secretions from individuals with SARS, broadly reactive PCR was used to identify the pathogen; unlike in the present study, in which the replicase 1a gene was targeted, the replicase 1b gene was targeted in the identification of the agent that causes SARS [5] .",

Many of the respiratory specimens in the initial pool of 601 specimens that tested negative by PCR with the replicase 1a gene primers tested positive by PCR with the HCoV-NH-specific primers. Subsequent sequence analysis of the target sites for the replicase 1a gene of HCoV-NH (data not shown) revealed several mismatches between the genome and primer sequence. This finding likely accounts for the relative decreased sensitivity of the replicase 1a gene primers. Among the 601 specimens initially screened, the 2 pooled reactions that tested positive for HCoV-NH contained multiple positive specimens. This may account for why these pooled specimens tested positive. It is also unclear why primers constructed for the detection of the 2 common HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, would not have detected HCoV-NH. Presumably, the genomic sequence targeted for the detection of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 is specific for these viruses. The sensitivity of the CoV consensus primers and the HCoV-NH-specific primers is unknown. Determination of the sensitivity will require propagation of the virus and development of a method for quantitating the number of viral particles (such as an infectivity assay or a method based on electron microscopy, neither of which have been completely developed for HCoV-NH).

The first HCoV isolated, B814, was not serologically related to either HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 [16] . McIntosh et al. demonstrated that 3 of the 6 OC strains isolated from adults with colds appeared to be serologically unrelated, or at least distantly related, to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E [17] . Experimental infection of human volunteers with these 6 OC strains confirmed this finding [18] . It was, therefore, unlikely that HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were the only HCoVs. The viral pathogen newly identified in New Haven and The Netherlands may represent the first of many antigenically distinct groups of HCoVs to be characterized.",

Because ours was not a population-based study and because a control group was not included, it is impossible to determine the spectrum of disease caused by HCoV-NH infection. Our study screened specimens submitted to a diagnostic laboratory only; therefore, the proportion of children with clinical illness reported here likely does not reflect that of the general population. Likewise, the issue of causality remains unresolved. Prospective population-based studies are required. Nonetheless, the identification of genetic sequences of this HCoV from a large number of children with respiratory tract illnesses strongly suggests that HCoV-NH infection plays a role in disease. Our data suggest that HCoV-NH, like other HCoVs, may have a seasonal distribution [8] . Animal CoVs cause disease in organ systems other than the respiratory tract, such as the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system [19] . SARS-CoV is excreted in the stool of infected individuals [6] . Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether HCoV-NH is present in other body fluids and whether it is associated with other clinical syndromes.",

(1.6%) and Fouchier et al. (2.9%) [10, 11] . The reasons for this are unclear. Both our study and those in The Netherlands screened respiratory specimens submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and used a PCR-based approach for screening. The characteristics of the study populations and the time of the acquisition of the specimens screened may explain the differences in the observed percentages of positive subjects between our study and the 2 studies in The Netherlands. Fouchier et al. limited screening for the novel HCoV to 3 months during late autumn and early winter [10] and, therefore, may have missed the peak circulation of the virus in the population. Also, we chose to screen only children !5 years old, whereas van der Hoek et al. chose to screen individuals of all ages [11] . Similar to other respiratory viruses, symptomatic infection with this newly discovered HCoV may be more common during childhood; therefore, we may have been more likely to detect a higher percentage of infected subjects in the present study. HCoVs can cause severe disease in infants [20] . In the present study, a majority (50/79 [63.3%]) of HCoV-NH-positive children were, in fact, !1 year old, and 34.2% were \u04403 months old.",
