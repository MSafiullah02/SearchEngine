The microbes tested were Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, Encephalitozoon intestinalis spores, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7, Aeromonas hydrophila, and bacteriophage MS2. The study showed the effects of filter run time, alternative loading rates, alternative filter media, and pH on pathogen removal. Results indicated that turbidity breakthrough was accompanied by breakthrough of all pathogens tested in this study. Results also suggest that the breakthrough of A. hydrophila and E. coli O157:H7 occurred more rapidly than that of turbidity. In general, filtration rate or alternative filter media configurations had no apparent effect on pathogen removal.",

A variety of viral, bacterial, and protozoan agents have been implicated as potentially important emerging waterborne agents. Although little is known about the fate, ecology, and distribution of these microorganisms in the aquatic environment, some of these microorganisms have already been identified as the cause of waterborne disease outbreaks (Mullens, 1996; CDC, 1993; CDC, 1991a; CDC, 1991b; Kaplan et al, 1982a; Kaplan et al, 1982b) .

The emergence of Giardia as a waterborne pathogen in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped reinforce the need for a multiple-barrier approach to water treatment. To address this need, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) in 1989 (USEPA, 1989) . This rule required filtration for most utilities that treat surface water and established minimum levels of disinfection for all utilities that treat surface water. In addition, the emergence of Cryptosporidium in the late 1980s and 1990s forced the USEPA to issue and propose a series of Enhanced SWTRs (USEPA, 2002; USEPA, 2000; USEPA, 1998; USEPA, 1994) . These regulatory actions trace how a pathogen can emerge to substantially alter regulatory policies and treatment practices. Given the significant effect these new rules have had on the drinking water industry, it is appropriate to ask whether some other organism could emerge to trigger more changes in both policy and practice.",

Table 2 shows average pathogen concentrations in the seeded Lake Mendota water. These concentrations were measured at a location between the two rapid-mix basins on each train (see yellow circles on Figures 1-3) . The cocktail was continuously fed to each pilot train at a flow rate of 5 mL/min from a 20 L (5.3 gal) high-density polyethylene container. The container was placed in a cooler with ice packs to help maintain the stability of the pathogen cocktail. A mixing system was designed to help maintain a uniform suspension of pathogens within the container. Details of the pathogen feed system and the preparation methods for the stock pathogen suspension are provided elsewhere (Harrington et al, 2001) . Five hours after the pathogen feed was initiated, the filter effluent was presumed to be at steady state with respect to the pathogen feed. During this 5 h period, pathogen samples were collected at a location between the two rapid-mix tanks (yellow circles on Figures 1-3) to evaluate the stability of the pathogen feed during this part of the run. These samples were collected 15 min, 2 h, and 4 h after initiation of the pathogen feed.",

In cases in which high turbidity or interfering materials rendered flow cytometry analysis ineffective or inadequately sensitive, oocysts and spores were enumerated manually by examining immunolabeled samples under epifluorescence conditions in a fluorescence microscope. 6 Reductions of oocysts and spores were then computed as the log-transformed ratio of pretreatment and posttreatment microbial densities.",

Raw water pH averaged 7.59\u00b10.11 during the experiment, and alum addition lowered the pH to an average of 7.46\u00b10.06 in settled waters. Treatment reduced UV 254 by an average of 9%, from 0.074\u00b10.003 cm -1 to 0.067\u00b10.007 cm -1 . These standard deviations showed that both pH and UV 254 were stable throughout the experiment, suggesting that raw water quality and alum dosage varied to an insignificant degree during the experiment. The variation in pH and UV 254 between the two filters was <0.07 pH units and 0.001 cm -1 , respectively. Therefore, the chemical quality of the water through filtration was reproducible. Filter effluent turbidities for the entire experiment are shown in Figure 4 , which indicates that turbidity breakthrough was evident after approximately 20 h of filter run time. Although breakthrough appears to have begun at around 16 h of run time, the turbidity values at 20 h of run time were not significantly different from values during the mature phase. From 3 h of filter run time to 20 h of filter run time, filter effluent turbidity averaged 0.16\u00b10.05 ntu. After this period, filter effluent turbidities increased steadily from an average of 0.20 ntu at 20 h to an average of 1.7 ntu at 35 h of filter run time. Figure 4 also shows that the two filters produced similar turbidity results, with filter 1 producing an average turbidity that was 0.02 ntu lower than the average turbidity produced by filter 2. A statistical analysis of the data from the two filters showed that the experimental uncertainty was 0.03 ntu (see Harrington et al, 2001 , for details of uncertainty calculations). Therefore, turbidity differ-ences between the two filters were within experimental error and not significant.",

Therefore, pathogen removal during the ripening phase was similar to pathogen removal in the mature filters. Between 5 and 20 h, removals of E. intestinalis spores and C. parvum oocysts remained stable, and this stability was consistent with that observed for filter effluent turbidity. However, removals of A. hydrophila and bacteriophage MS2 declined significantly between these two sample times, suggesting that breakthrough of these microbes occurred earlier than that of turbidity. Beyond 20 h, significant breakthrough was observed for all microorganisms and was consistent with the extensive breakthrough of turbidity. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 was poorly removed throughout the run, implying that breakthrough of this pathogen took place prior to the 45 min sampling time. ",
