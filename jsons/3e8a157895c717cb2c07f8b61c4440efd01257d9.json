Within a short time, it has spread to countries on all continents disrupting the daily life of people and having serious impact on the world economy. The latest rapid risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that Europe was heading for sustained community transmission, containment is no longer possible and that community control measures are needed [1] . The virus is likely to spread to the rest of the world within a short time.",

The control measures have profound and long lasting negative effects on society and economy, but when effective, they ensure health systems can keep up with the number of seriously ill people and ultimately save lives [2] . The heterogeneity in control approaches is naturally caused by differences in culture, health systems and stage in the epidemic, but may also be influenced by the lack of objective and robust surveillance that maps the evolution of the epidemic and provide evidence to inform control approaches in advance. Approaches to obtain population-based evidence are rapidly needed.",

Most countries follow a traditional and vigilant approach of disease surveillance mainly based on case identification (syndromic surveillance), tracing and testing of contacts and high-risk individuals (risk-based surveillance) with daily reporting of: infected, recovered and deaths cases, at area and country level [3] . This allows treatment and isolation of ill people and quarantine of individuals. However, it does not allow warning or forecasting of cases early and ahead of time, nor give an objective overview of the situation to inform decision-making in regards to direction of medical resources or the best timing for community control measures.",

The risk-based surveillance on high-risk individuals e.g. contacts, enhances the ability to detect the expected few new cases as soon as possible by targeting those that are more likely to be infected than others. In a very low prevalence or early epidemic scenario, riskbased surveillance is cost-efficient and more likely to find cases than random survey-based surveillance, because resources are targeted at the high-risk subpopulations. However, once the infection becomes established and individual clusters are no longer traced, the usefulness of syndromic or risk-based surveillance data to guide control decisions at community level is reduced, because the cases identified are not representative of the infected individuals in the population. Furthermore, identified cases will already be needing health care and the health systems become reactive to the current situation, rather than proactive in prioritising, what is needed where in the coming weeks.",

It is an impressive effort and it will save many lives. In veterinary medicine, epidemics due to new or exotic disease incursion into fully susceptible populations are not uncommon e.g. Avian Influenza, Bluetongue in Europe and Porcine Endemic Diarrhoea in the US. Regular outbreaks of exotic or novel diseases have resulted in a documented experience in handling outbreaks in fully susceptible populations, and the veterinary sector has a skilled, well-developed and trialled emergency response in most countries. Throughout time, a variety of surveillance methods to understand the spread and to support effective control decisions in real time, have been successfully applied and resulted in elimination of the disease from the populations. We encourage the public health sector to consider whether the veterinary experience obtained from epidemics in animal populations could offer additional expertise to the current vigorous public health response to COVID-19.",

In other words, the incentives to efficiently contain outbreaks of infectious diseases are strong, just like the ones we see with the COVID-19 outbreak. For this reason, veterinary epidemiologists have a well-developed toolbox of surveillance strategies. During an outbreak among animals, random surveys are conducted to understand the epidemic nature and dynamics of the infection and provide evidence for decision-making on control. random surveys, a prevalence estimate is calculated to understand the extent of the spread of disease, to follow the situation over time and to suggest, predict or model, what happens in near future. Random surveys are representative of the population they sample, and provide better knowledge of the situation than the other types of surveillance, delivering more accurate evidence for decision-making on community control options.",
