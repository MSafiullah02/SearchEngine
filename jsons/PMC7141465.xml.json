            "text": "COVID-19 pneumonia has been listed Category B infectious disease and is being treated in a category similar to that of Category A by the National Health Commission of China. A large proportion of COVID-19 patients will progress to a critical condition which needs intensive care. However, given the challenges in treating this disease, ICU nurses are highly prone to somatic symptom disorder (SSD) which is associated with the interaction of biology, cognition, emotion, behavior and environment1. The ICU nurses must manage a heavy workload requiring frequent invasive procedures and high attention levels. Therefore, safeguarding the physical and psychological health of ICU nurses can provide a major contribution to the success of epidemic control 2\n,\n3. A symptom cluster is a stable group of two or more co-existing symptoms. The symptom clusters in one population may show overlaps and interactions, a phenomenon that should be resolved to improve the efficiency of managing the disorder 4\n,\n5. Currently, no study has investigated SSDs in ICU nurses fighting at the frontline against the COVID-19 epidemic. Previous studies have confirmed that an individual\u2019s response to SSD is dependent on physical, emotional and social factors 6. This study aims to analyze SSDs and associated risk factors in 140 ICU nurses who were sent by Jiangsu Province Hospital to No.1 Hospital of Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic.",

Twelve second-level ICF categories were selected from the component of \u201cBody Function\u201d in ICF (Table 1\n). At this step, standardized ICF-linking rules were used 8. Finally, a list of ICF categories was compiled that was intended to cover 16 symptoms that ICU nurses could reasonably have experienced when treating COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China (Table 1). The frequency and severity of each symptom were scaled (0, no; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe).",
