            "text": "Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is increasingly used in the management of patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Infections are frequently the etiologies underlying the respiratory, and occasionally cardiac, failure that necessitates ECLS. Just as importantly, infections are among the most commonly reported adverse events during ECLS. Infections in this setting may be the sequelae of prolonged critical illness or of underlying immune dysregulation; they may be hospital-acquired infections, and they may or may not be attributable to the presence of ECLS itself, the latter being an aspect that can be difficult to determine. Current registry data and evidence from the literature offer some insights, but also leave open many questions regarding the nature and significance of infections reported both before and during ECLS, including the question of any causal link between ECLS and the development of infections. An ongoing lack of consistency in the identification, diagnosis, management, and prevention of infections during ECLS is limiting our ability to interpret literature data and thus highlighting the need for more rigorous investigation and standardization of definitions. This review aims to characterize the current understanding of infections associated with the use of ECLS, taking into account data from the updated Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry, which provides important context for understanding the epidemiology and outcomes of these patients.",

Blood is drained through a cannula situated in a central vessel (typically a vein), pumped through a membrane, where oxygen is delivered to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed, and then reinfused back through a cannula into a central vessel (vein or artery, depending on the circuit configuration and indication) [1] .

            "text": "Severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common indication for venovenous ECLS, and presumed or proven infectious etiologies typically account for a large proportion of ARDS cases [4] [5] [6] . Cardiogenic shock, a condition resulting from a heterogeneous group of diseases, is the most common indication for venoarterial ECLS [1] ; again, the underlying etiology may be related to an infectious trigger (e.g., sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy, acute myocarditis, infective endocarditis). A clear understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes associated with the various infectious etiologies of cardiopulmonary failure is essential in order to select the patients most likely to benefit from ECLS. Equally important is the ability to recognize and manage the infectious complications that can arise during ECLS, which may or may not be attributable to the device itself, and which may adversely impact outcomes. Administering ECLS involves the placement of intravascular catheters, which introduces a risk of both catheter site infections and catheter-associated blood stream infections [7] . The concomitant use of invasive mechanical ventilation in many of these patients exposes them to the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [7, 8] . The ECLS population may be particularly susceptible to additional nosocomial infections as a result of concomitant critical illness and associated prolonged hospitalization, which often coincides with the use of other indwelling catheters (e.g., non-ECLS central venous catheters, urinary catheters, etc.) and devices (e.g., continuous renal replacement therapies, intra-aortic balloon pumps, percutaneous ventricular assist devices) [9] . Furthermore, underlying comorbidities, critical illness, or perhaps even the extracorporeal circuit itself, may cause immune dysregulation, potentially leading to a higher rate of infectious complications. The management of infections during ECLS is made even more challenging by alterations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents in the presence of both critical illness and extracorporeal circuitry [10, 11] . This narrative review aims to characterize the current understanding of infections associated with ECLS, discuss the challenges in identifying and treating these infections, and highlight areas where more data are needed to better understand the susceptibility to and impact of infections in patients managed with ECLS.",

With regard to specific infectious organisms, one of the most widely reported indications for ECLS in ARDS is influenza A (H1N1), partly as a result of the rapid increase in the use of ECLS during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Data from several large observational studies suggest, overall, that there is a probable benefit to be derived from the use of ECLS in H1N1-associated severe ARDS refractory to conventional therapy [13] [14] [15] . Whereas no specific infectious etiology has been identified as a contraindication to the use of ECLS, co-infections in the context of influenzaassociated ARDS, including infections with S. aureus, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and Aspergillus, may correlate with lower survival compared with influenza alone [16] [17] [18] [19] . Likewise, concomitant nonpulmonary infections at the time of initiation of ECLS for ARDS may predict worse outcomes and this factor has been incorporated into a validated prognostic scoring system [20] .",

The results of an ELSO registry search for all infectious organisms identified on culture prior to the initiation of ECLS between January 1, 2012 (correlating with a reformatting of data entry within the registry for more extensive detail on infections) and July 31, 2019 are summarized in Figs. 1 and 3a, and in the Online Resource, with the most common pathogens listed by frequency. These data should be interpreted with caution, as culture positivity may not represent true infection, and the presence of these organisms prior to the initiation of ECLS may or may not have contributed to the cardiopulmonary failure that prompted the use of ECLS. Furthermore, when interpreting infections identified during ECLS, it is important to take into account any pre-ECLS infections; indeed, without a thorough understanding of what was present prior to ECLS, any pre-existing infections may incorrectly be characterized as de novo ones. With regard to the frequency of positive cultures, represented as a percentage of total ECLS runs, it is important to remember that individual patients may be represented by more than one culture. Additionally, registry data is self-reported by ELSO member centers, and may therefore be influenced by variability in data collection and in interpretation of data definitions; furthermore, these data, even if accurate, may not be representative of ECLS practices at non-ELSO-affiliated sites. Albeit subject to these important limitations and caveats, the registry data search revealed 5492 positive cultures prior to the initiation of 17,374 distinct ECLS runs for respiratory failure (31.6%). Positive cultures prior to ECLS appeared to be much more common in the case of ECLS administered for respiratory failure than for cardiac indications (8.8% of cardiac failure runs; 7% of runs for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation",

[25] reported a 21% prevalence rate of nosocomial infections among adults recorded in the ELSO registry from 1998-2008, whereas previous case series estimated nosocomial infection rates of between 9 and 65% during ECLS [7, [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

The distribution of pathogens during ECLS was found to be similar to the pre-ECLS pattern. Yeast and S. aureus were the most common organisms in the respiratory tract during ECLS across all three groups, whereas Staphylococcus, yeast, and Enterococcus were among the organisms isolated most frequently from blood cultures. The survival rates of individuals with positive cultures during ECLS administered for respiratory failure or cardiac failure were lower than the overall survival rates of all ECLS recipients over a similar timeframe (54.3% vs 61.1% and 38.0% vs 44.2%) [12], whereas survival among culture-positive ECPR patients was the lowest of the three groups but comparable to that observed in the general ECPR population (30.2% vs 29.9%) [12].

This can only be speculated upon from the existing data (Table 1 ). It has been suggested, initially in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, that extracorporeal circuitry affects the immune system through multiple mechanisms (e.g., induction of endothelial dysfunction, activation of the contact system, coagulation cascade, neutrophils and platelets with consequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators) [32] , and that the resulting immune system impairment might explain why ECLS may increase susceptibility to infection [33] . In contrast to this supposed hyperinflammatory response to ECLS, there exist equally compelling data suggesting that ECLS promotes an anti-inflammatory state through improvements in end-organ perfusion and gas exchange in patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure and reductions in pro-inflammatory injury (e.g., ventilator-induced lung injury) [34, 35] . A prospective observational study of 262 adult patients with severe ARDS reported a rapid decline in IL-6 and IL-8 levels within 24 h of the start of venovenous ECLS. Higher cytokine levels were associated with extra-pulmonary causes of ARDS, more aggressive ventilation before ECLS, and mortality [36] . The overall balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory effects (i.e., whether end-organ protective strategies outweigh the injurious effects of ECLS) likely determine the impact on the immune response and the consequent risk of infection. Whether these alterations pose an increased risk of infection after decannulation from ECLS is an area that warrants further investigation [37] .",

With 6-month survival rates standing at only 30%, particular consideration should be given to preventive practices and close surveillance of infections during ECLS in this vulnerable patient population. Of note, the acquisition of nosocomial infections was not an independent predictor of mortality in multivariable analysis. While ECLS duration has frequently been associated with the development of nosocomial infections [7, [26] [27] [28] [29] , no existing analyses are able to determine whether longer duration of support is a risk factor for or a consequence of acquired infections. Prolonged use of ECLS will increase the opportunity to acquire infections, and infections are likely to contribute to, and increase the duration of, critical illness. Any relationship found between nosocomial infections and duration of ECLS should be interpreted with particular caution, as patients who acquire and die from infections early in their hospitalization would obviously have had shorter ECLS durations.",

The lipophilicity and protein binding characteristics of a given drug play an important role in its interaction with the circuit [11] . Several antibiotics have been studied in the context of ECLS, and shown varying susceptibility to subtherapeutic levels due to sequestration or increased Vd; the results have been summarized elsewhere [10, 11] .

Whether or not antibiotic, or antifungal, prophylaxis is warranted or affects the incidence of nosocomial infections may become moot if most patients are already receiving antimicrobial agents at the time of initiation of ECLS. For example, 97% of patients in the previously mentioned cohort of immunocompromised patients were receiving antibiotics before ECLS, despite in many cases not having an infectious etiology for their respiratory failure [6] . Other infection prevention practices, including cannula maintenance strategies, vary across centers [46, 50] . Many of the recommendations put forth by ELSO, such as the use of sterile techniques, adherence to VAP prevention guidelines, and avoidance or removal of unnecessary invasive devices, mirror general infection prevention practices followed in critically ill patients (Fig. 4) [26, 49] . One emerging VAP prevention strategy that may be used in selected ECLS patients is endotracheal extubation with removal of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with primarily cardiac failure, who have relatively preserved gas exchange, patients with predominantly hypercapnic respiratory failure, or those in whom early mobilization is of greater importance to their ultimate recovery, such as patients receiving ECLS as a bridge to transplantation, may be particularly suitable for such a strategy [51] . The roles of other infection prevention strategies that have been explored in general critical care populations, such as selective digestive decontamination, remain uncertain in ECLS patients.",
