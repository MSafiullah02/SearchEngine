            "text": "The vast majority of pregnancies occur amongst a generally healthy patient population, i.e. females from the teenage years in to the 40s. In most cases, the pregnancy is uneventful and where infections do arise, these are often relatively minor and easily treatable, e.g. urinary tract infection and vaginal thrush. However, sepsis is now the leading cause of maternal deaths in the UK accounting for 26 deaths between 2006 and 2008 and there has been an increase in death due to community-acquired b-haemolytic streptococci group A (BHSGA) (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) disease [1]. A literature review of 55 pregnancies with symptomatic Groups A streptococcal infection since 1966 recorded early onset septic shock in 91 % with a maternal mortality rate of 58 % but the mortality has improved to 32 % in recent years [2]. Furthermore, when toxic shock syndrome due to BHSGA (can also be caused by Staphylococcus aureus) occurs during pregnant, it can have devasting consequences with multi-organ failure and a mortality of over 50 % in reported cases [3]. A recent review from the UK covers many of the important issues \u00adassociated with GAS in the obstetrical setting including the its diverse manifestations, the need to manage puerperal sepsis caused by BHSGA quickly, suggested initial antibiotic therapy (e.g. cefuroxime and metronidazole until confirmed), and issues such as prophylaxis for contacts and the possible role of intravenous immunoglobulins [4].",

The principles of the management of the critically ill septic patient in obstetrics or gynecology are similar to those of any other patient, i.e. rapid clinical evaluation, appropriate investigations and resuscitation with effective antibiotics [5]. In 2012, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK issued guidelines on the management of bacterial sepsis during and following pregnancy [6, 7]. These highlight the risk factors for sepsis as identified by national data into maternal deaths, e.g. obesity, vaginal discharge and a history of pelvic infection, emphasize the possible sources, e.g. mastitis, urinary tract, pneumonia and skin and soft tissue, and highlight to all those looking after pregnant women the cardinal signs, i.e. pyrexia or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, etc. The importance of blood cultures are emphasized and options and limitations of empirical antibiotic choices, e.g. cefuroxime does not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamaase producing Gram negative bacteria [7]. Finally, suggested audit topics are provided, e.g. the proportion of acutely ill septic pregnant women who have serum lactate measured within 6 h of presentation [6].",

This involves a degree of immune suppression, but it would be incorrect to refer to the pregnant state as an immunocompromised state, rather it is one in which the immune state is modulated and not suppressed. Amongst the changes that occur are the increased numbers of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells around the placenta to facilitate a normal and healthy fetal-maternal immune interaction. Implantation, placentation and generally the first two thirds of pregnancy represent a physiological condition analogous to an open wound that requires a strong inflammatory response. This facilitates rapid fetal growth and development that occurs during the second trimester. This shift in cytokine response renders the pregnant woman more susceptible to certain infections such as malaria during the first half of pregnancy [9]. Humoral immunity is essential for fighting many bacterial infections and this is augmented by T-helper type II lymphocytes and during pregnancy this results in a vigorous antibody-mediated immunity to many pathogens (see Table 12.1) [10].",

In addition to immunological parameters, other physiological changes in pregnancy have an impact such as increased heart rate, stroke volume and oxygen consumption with decreased lung capacity, which may contribute to the more severe manifestations of some viral infections such as influenza and varicella [9]. Consequently, all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid viral and other infections during pregnancy, but when they occur, variations in the normal presentation or in the severity of infection should be anticipated.\n",

Cesarean delivery does result in a surgical site, which may subsequently become infected, especially if certain risk factors are present, e.g. obesity and diabetes mellitus. There has been considerable interest in recent years in the surveillance of surgical site infections (SSI) following a variety of surgical procedures such as hip replacement as well as after Cesarean delivery as minimising SSI is an indicator of the quality of patient care. The incidence of SSI after Cesarean delivery can be up to 20 % but in healthcare systems where there is an emphasis on surveillance and infection prevention, the SSI rate is often less than 5 % [11]. Furthermore, the dissemination of surveillance results can result in reduced rates, even in the absence of active prevention measures. However, such preventative measures include the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, \u00adtypically with a cephalosporin, which should be administered prior to the surgical incision and which can reduce post-delivery maternal SSI by up to 50 % [12].",

The recent history of post-partum infection, including endomyometritis, mirrors that of other infections in terms of the recent emergence of gram negative bacilli and antibiotic resistance. High fever and significant pain should prompt consideration of this diagnosis and both uterine drainage and blood cultures are recommended [4, 13].

There has been much discussion about the role of intrauterine devices (IUD) but recent reviews suggest that these do not predispose to PID per se but that PID may occur if the device is inserted at a time when the woman has a sexually transmissible disease such as gonorrhea [17, 18]. Furthermore, the suggestion that an IUD leads to actinomycosis is not borne out by the literature or experience even if actinomyces-like organisms may be seen on a cervical smear [18]. Abdominal actinomycosis is relatively unusual, is not predisposed to by IUDs, and would not necessarily require admission per se to an intensive care unit.",

Nonetheless, PID is a very treatable condition with often a combination of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin plus doxycycline or a quinolone, e.g. levofloxacin with metronidazole [16], notwithstanding the above caveat about resistance. However, all isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be tested for susceptibility to quinolones and other agents. The normal duration of therapy is approximately 14 days. In some countries, there is an active programme of \u00adchlamydia screening which is said to be cost effective in many settings.

Pregnancy has long been recognised as a risk factor for more severe presentations, including admission to intensive care for ventilation. Recent surveys during influenza seasons have revealed that the incidence of hospitalisation is 0.1 % amongst pregnant women and is especially likely if asthma, obesity or smoking during pregnancy occurs [20, 21]. Also, women admitted to hospital with influenza are more likely to deliver pre-term [20]. In a recent review of influenza H1N1 in South Africa, of 19 patients who needed artificial ventilation, six were pregnant, many developed complications such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and four died [22].",

However, it can be confirmed by PCR or electron microscopy (both likely to give a same day result), and culture (may take some days) of vesicle fluid or material from the base of a vesicle. Increasingly, PCR is available because of its sensitivity and the provision of a rapid result. While the presence of IgM to varicella zoster is strongly suggestive of recent chicken pox, there may have been insufficient time between exposure to the clinical manifestations to render a positive immunological response, and consequently IgM may not be detected early in the course of the illness.T-helper cell type 2 response and cytokine shift to an anti-inflammatory mode, especially during the first 6 months of pregnancy together with physiological changes such as increased oxygen consumption, all probably play a role in the increased disease severity during pregnancy. However, the precise factors that are specific to varicella causing pneumonia are not known but some patients have ARDS as a component.Chicken pox pneumonia is highly likely if the above investigations are positive and there is clinical and radiological evidence. ARDS and for example pulmonary emboli are also possible. However, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) or protected brush specimens (PSB) tested by PCR are likely to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possible causes, e.g. legionella.Anti-viral drugs for varicella zoster virus such as aciclovir are indicated. The high mortality associated with varicella pneumonia offsets the potential risk to the fetus of adverse consequences due to anti-viral agents. Broad-spectrum antibiotics e.g. co-amoxyclav with clarithromycin but in accordance with local/national guidelines and antibiotic susceptibility data, may be started empirically if the patient is very ill and a secondary bacterial pneumonia is suspected.\n",
