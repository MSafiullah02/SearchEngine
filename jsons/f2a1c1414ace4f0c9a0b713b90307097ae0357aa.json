The aim of the project is to develop an intelligent conversation agent called AINI to answer domain specific questions as well as open-domain (or common sense) questions. In this report, we have used the subject -bird flu as the domain knowledge of interest to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed system. The key contribution described in this paper is the integration of the common sense knowledge and domain specific knowledge in the form of a \"knowledge matrix.\" The system is based on a layered and modular design, and the answers for the queries are searched from these modules. The proposed system is based on an intelligent conversation agent called AINI and an AKEA.

The knowledge modules can be considered as transformations over this XML data structure. The system accepts questions or queries from the users and it processes the queries based on the information contained in AINI's knowledge bases. The system is implemented by open-source architecture employing a Kannel Mobile gateway, PHP, Perl scripting language, Apache Server and knowledge base stored in a MySQL server.

As indicated by literature in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the top-down approach is by far the best approach. As shown in Fig. 1 , the top-down NL-query approach consists of six levels of queries, namely Spell Checker (Level 0), Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning (NLUR) (Level 1), FAQChat (Level 2), Metadata Index Search (Level 3), Pattern Matching and Case-based Reasoning (PMCBR) (Level 4) and Supervised Learning (Level 5).

Research and information on H5N1 pandemic have become increasingly important as the pandemic may have dire global implications. Wall Street Journal Online 7) predicted that this pandemic could be worse than the one in 1918 which killed at least 20 million people. In addition, the World Health Organization estimates the H5N1 virus could infect up to 30 percent of the world's population. Shigeru Omi, a WHO official, also warned that an estimation of 2 to 7 million deaths are \"conservative\" and that the maximum figure could be as high as 50 million. 29) The AINI's domain knowledge matrix model incorporates several knowledge subjects. This is analogous to the consultation of expertise knowledge from multiple experts. For example, a sales domain knowledge should contain expertise or knowledge on how to improve sales. However, as a sales person, he or she is expected to have a wide range of common sense knowledge and the ability to engage the potential customer. Hence, the intelligent system should also incorporate open-domain knowledge to handle general or generic questions. In here, the open-domain knowledge is not necessary the common sense knowledge which is assumed to be possessed by everyone. The open-domain refers to the accessibility of the knowledge. Hence, they are still categorized according to knowledge domain. By including multiple domain knowledge bases with AINI's single domain knowledge, the proposed AINI will be able to hold \"meaningful\" conversations with the users. In this proposed system, the open-domain and domain-specific knowledge are pre-defined in the Data Layer. These modules are used to support the various knowledge levels at the Application Layer. Depending on the user's input, the agent will respond or switch from one Level to another. While the system is capable to communicate with the user beyond the domain knowledge, there are cases that the system will exhaust its capability to answer the queries. In such case, the system will attempt to divert the focus back to the current topic of interest by responding with some predefined random statements. The purpose is to direct the users' back to the system's domain-specific state. Hence AINI will attempt to \"cycle\" between the 6 levels of information processing within the Application Layer supported by the various knowledge modules in the Data Layer.",

In this approach, the knowledge base of the AINI can be considered as a collection of specific conversation domain units. Each unit handles a specific body of knowledge used during the conversation between AINI and the user. The knowledge can be seen as arranged in the vertical columns making up the open domain or domain-specific knowledge. In addition, specific subjects are shown in the horizontal rows. For example, in the open domain knowledge, the subject units will cover topics such as personality, business, biology, computer, etc. In this report, our focus is on the medical subject and in particular, the bird flu pandemic, therefore there are additional modules being incorporated. The domain knowledge model plays a major role in conversational systems. Such systems normally are comprised with two subcategories: the traditional or narrow domain, and, the open domain. In the traditional domain, systems attempt conversational fluency based on limited domains of expertise. ELIZA 34) for example simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist, and this implementation is commonly known as DOCTOR. The Rogerian psychotherapist knowledge base attempts to engage the patient by repeating the patient's statements, and by encouraging the patient to continue talking. Terry Winograd's SHRDLU 37) is another program simulating a robot which is able to interact within a simple world which consists of colored building blocks and boxes on a flat surface.

However, Cyc model and OpenMind had bottlenecks which prevent truly large-scale collaboration 33) . The first is the fact that knowledge does not grow by itself. Every new rule or axiom has to be entered manually and the process takes a lot of patience and time. Furthermore, information has to be input with the CycL programming language and to follow the rules of the system. The second drawback is the complexity of Cyc. It will need months to install and implement a system that is based on the knowledge base of Cyc. On the other hand, Mindpixel started collecting their propositions privately via email in 1994 and then evolved to online mass collaboration. To date, the project's user base of nearly fifty thousand people has contributed more than one million propositions and recorded almost ten million individual propositional response measurements. AINIs use only 10% of the Mindpixel propositions. In practice, 10% of the training corpus is held back from training to act as a generalization test to ensure the system does not simply memorize the corpus. Passing this generalization test would be the basis for claiming that the system is able to replicate human-level intelligence in a machine. Although a lot of knowledge has been collected, it is recognized that the system is still less than the uncountable \"pieces\" of common sense knowledge that are estimated to be involved with human intelligence. 31) A second common sense knowledge component deployed by AINI is a training corpus from TREC as shown in Table 1 . TREC, organized each year by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has offered a specific track to evaluate large-scale open domain question-answering (QA) systems since 1999. Finding textual answers to open domain questions in large text collections is a difficult problem. In our system, we only extracted factoid questions to be incorporated in the AINI's engine. Our concern is the types of questions that could be answered in more than one way. We have tried to avoid such questions. In conversational systems, factoid questions should have only single factual answers. 3, 12, 13, 36) These are considered as a good stimulus-response type of knowledge unit. Examples of such questions are, \"Who is the author of the book, The Iron Lady: A Biography's of Margaret Thatcher? \" \"What was the name of the first Russian astronaut to do a Spacewalk? \" or \"When was the telegraph invented? \" TREC's corpus has a considerably lower rate of answer redundancy than the web and thus, it is easier to answer a question by simply extracting the answers from the matching text. To gather this data, we automatically classified questions in the TREC 8 through TREC 10 test sets by their 'wh'-word and then manually distinguished factoid questions, which represented * 3 www.openmind.org * 4 www.cyc.com around half of the initial corpus as shown in Table 1 .",

The competition is based on the Turing Test 1) which aims to determine whether the responses from a computer can convince a human into thinking that the computer is a real person. In the competition, ALICE used a library of over 30,000 stimulus-response pairs written in AIML to answer the queries. The development of ALICE is based on the fact that the distribution of the sentences in conversations tends to follow Zipf's Law. 25) It is indicated that the number of \"first words\" is only limited to about two thousand. The frequency of any word is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. The most frequently used word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word. It in turn occurs twice as often as the third most frequent word, and so forth. Questions starting with \"WHAT IS\" tend to have Zipf-like distributions. This type of analysis can now be accomplished in a few milliseconds of computer time. While the possibilities * 5 www.alicebot.org/aiml/aaa/ of what can be said are infinite, the range of what is actually said in conversation in most cases is surprisingly small.

These seeds are supposed to be representative of the domain under investigation. The seed terms are randomly combined and each combination is used in Google API * 6 and BootCat Tool 6) for bootstrapping corpora and terms from the web. We used the seeds to perform a set of Google searches, asking Google to return a maximum of 20 URLs per query and then we collected the corpus. After visual inspection of the corpus, we used the top 40 seeds extracted from token frequencies for the second run. Finally, we retrieved 1,428 URLs out of 1,500 URLs related to the domain being investigated. The reduction in number is due to the duplicated and broken link URLs being removed. Based on the 1,428 URLs, we sent a query to Google's PageRank TM directory using PaRaMeter Tool 11) to determine their rankings. Figure 3 shows the results of the top 10 site based on the PageRank TM scale. The PageRank TM scale goes from 1 to 10. A less important site is the one with a PageRank (PR) of 1. The most referenced and supposedly important sites are those with a PR of between 7 and 10. The final set of URLs was further culled to include only selected sites which are attributed to a regulated authority (such as a governmental or educational institution) that controls the content of the sites. Once the seed set is determined, each URL's page is further examined and rated as either reliable or reputable. This selection is reviewed, rated and tested for connectivity with the trusted seed pages. From this exercise, whitehouse.gov, pandemicflu.org, cdc.gov and who.int were selected due to their PageRank TM scale scores being above 7. The most important factors in determining the \"reliable authority\" of a site is based on its history and the number of back-links to the governmental and international organization links. The more established and relevantly linked the more it will be considered as \"stronger\" or \"more reliable.\" This effectively gives the linked site a measure of \"trust\" and \"credential.\" The selected URLs are then used as the source knowledge base for AKEA to extract the contents on bird flu so as to build AINI's domain-specific knowledge base. A discussion of the extracted information is given in the following section.",

AINI's SQL engine uses the most significant words as keywords or phrase. It attempts to find the longest pattern to match without using any linguistic tools or NLP analysis. In this component, AINI does not need a linguistic knowledge unit and relies on just an SQL query. All questions and answers can be extracted from the database which was built by AKEA after applying a filtering process to remove unnecessary tags. Example results from the system are illustrated in the next section. Table 2 , AINI's open domain knowledge base currently has more than 150,000 entries in the common sense stimulus-response categories. Out of these, 100,000 came from Mindpixel, 997 factoid questions from the TREC training corpus and 45,318 categories from AAA knowledge bases. On the domain-specific knowledge base, AINI has more then 1,000 online documents extracted by AKEA. This makes up 10,000 stimulus-response items in total. AINI also has 158 FAQ pairs of questions and answers which have been updated using AKEA. In addition, AINI has also collected more than 382,623 utterances in conversations with online users since 2005. These utterances will be integrated into AINI's knowledge bases through supervised learning by domain experts. At present, AINI has learnt 50,000 categories from conversations with online users. All of this combined knowledge has made up the total of 206,473 stimulus response categories in AINI's knowledge bases. In comparison to other system, the original conversational programs such as ELIZA, 35) written by Professor Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT, have only 200 stimulus response categories. ALICE Silver Edition was ranked the \"most human\" computer, and has about 120,000 categories which include 80,000 taken from Mindpixel. In this experiment, three types of systems are compared. They are search engine, question answering system and conversational system. For each system, we compared two different engines against AINI. The two search engines compared are Google and Yahoo. For the question answering engines, AskJeeves and START are used. They are supposed to use natural language processing for their queries. For the conversational engines, ELIZA and ALICE are selected. In particular, ALICE was ranked as the \"most human computer\" in the Turing Test competition. 28) Google is a well known search engine which determines relevancy of information primarily on their PageRank algorithm. 24) In our experiment, we developed a search engine interface using Google SOAP Search API service 22) and Yahoo!. 38) For the Question Answering system, the idea behind Ask Jeeves and START is to allow users to get answers for questions posed in natural language. ASK Jeeves is the first commercially question answering system available on the Internet. START 27) is the world's first Web-based question answering system which commenced operation since December, 1993. ELIZA is a well known program in the discipline of Artificial Intelligence and it is also the oldest system In a way, AINI can also be considered as an enhancement of ALICE with the inclusion of the pandemic domain-specific knowledge base which was extracted by AKEA, and it also has parsing capabilities based on a full Natural Language Understanding engine for multilevel natural language query. 17) In the present study, appropriate or accurate domain responses are expected to be important. The control question set was submitted to the seven URLs where the seven systems were located. The responses of the queries are then collected and displayed as shown in Fig. 4 ",
