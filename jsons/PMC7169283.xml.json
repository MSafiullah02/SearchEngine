Three\u2010view (left\u2010right lateral, right\u2010left lateral, and ventrodorsal) thoracic radiographs obtained at the time of diagnosis were required to be included in the study. Dogs were excluded from the study if they were diagnosed with concurrent nonrespiratory thoracic disease or did not have diagnostic three\u2010view thoracic radiographs available for review. For each dog, the signalment (age, breed, sex), history, and method of diagnosis were recorded from the medical record by board\u2010certified veterinary radiologist (S.S.). The results of any additional respiratory diagnostics and method of sample collection were also recorded. Thoracic radiographs were independently reviewed by two board\u2010certified veterinary radiologists (S.S., A.S.) using dedicated image\u2010viewing software (Osirix, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). The results of independent reading sessions were compared and, where disagreement occurred, a consensus opinion was generated. Reviewers were aware of the patient's diagnosis and allowed to adjust contrast and brightness of the images as would be done in the clinical setting. Radiographic characteristics recorded were the following: presence of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, cranial mediastinal widening/fluid accumulation, and abnormal pulmonary patterns. If present, pleural effusion was graded as mild (minimal displacement the lung lobes), moderate (heart and diaphragm partially obscured), or severe (heart and diaphragm completely obscured). Abnormal pulmonary patterns were classified as unstructured interstitial, structured/nodular interstitial, bronchial, and alveolar. The distribution of the abnormal pulmonary patterns was recorded as cranioventral, perihilar, caudodorsal, or diffuse. If diffuse, the changes were further subclassified as symmetric or asymmetric. The specific lung lobes affected were also recorded.",

There were four neutered males and two spayed females. Five of the six dogs presented for coughing, while one dog presented for lethargy and shallow breathing. Four dogs had a history of recently visiting a boarding/daycare facility with two dogs having known direct contact with dogs subsequently diagnosed with canine influenza virus. In regards to additional respiratory diagnostics, three of six patients were diagnosed with concurrent Mycoplasma pneumonia based on a positive polymerase chain reaction via a transtracheal wash (1) or pharyngeal swab (2). All six dogs had a respiratory polymerase chain reaction panel which, in addition to canine influenza virus and Mycoplasma, also tested for Bordatella bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus 1 and 2, canine distemper virus, and coronavirus; all of which were negative.",

This dog was also positive for Mycoplasma. One dog had an unstructured interstitial pattern, while the remaining five dogs had two pulmonary patterns present, unstructured interstitial and alveolar (Fig. 1). No dog was identified with a structured interstitial or bronchial pattern. The distribution of the pulmonary patterns was cranioventral in four dogs, diffuse in one, and caudodorsal in one. None of the dogs had a perihilar distribution. The one dog with a diffuse pulmonary pattern was further classified as asymmetric being more severe in the right lung lobes (Fig. 2). The dog with a caudodorsal distribution of an unstructured interstitial pattern had a cranioventral alveolar pattern on follow up thoracic radiographs 3 days later. No other dog had follow up radiographs for comparison. In all dogs, multiple lung lobes were affected. The left cranial, left caudal, right cranial, right middle, and right caudal lungs were affected in two dogs; one with a cranioventral distribution, and another with a diffuse distribution. Two dogs had abnormal pulmonary patterns in the right cranial, right middle, and left cranial lung lobes; both with a cranioventral distribution.

Thus possible effects of coinfection with Mycoplasma spp. on the radiographic findings in this sample of dogs remain unclear.
