This disease has a variable impact in different countries depending on their cultural norms, mitigation efforts and health infrastructure. In India, a majority of people rely upon traditional Indian medicine to treat human maladies due to less-cost, easier availability and without any side-effect. These medicines are made by herbal plants. This study aims to assess the Indian herbal plants in the pursuit of potential COVID-19 inhibitors using in silico approaches. We have considered 18 extracted compounds of 11 different species of these plants. Our calculated lipophilicity, aqueous solubility and binding affinity of the extracted compounds suggest that the inhibition potentials in the order; harsingar > aloe vera > giloy > turmeric > neem > ashwagandha > red onion > tulsi > cannabis > black pepper. On comparing the binding affinity with hydroxychloroquine, we note that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very promising.",

According to the latest update of the WHO 1 , there are more than 1 million cases of the COVID-19 worldwide, causing almost 50 thousand deaths affecting 203 countries, areas or territories. This novel coronavirus was detected in late December 2019 and recognized in early January 2020 in China 2,3 . On 11 February 2020, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses declared this \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Unfortunately, there has been no noticeable breakthrough in the management of this disease to date and the patient is given a treatment based on his observable and diagnosable symptoms. Although several attempts have been made in the research and development of the diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for this novel coronavirus 7 , there exists no chemotherapeutic agent so far which has been shown unequivocally to be effective in treating human diseases due to a minuscule virus. To combat this deadly COVID-19, a number of conventional drugs 8-10 like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, etc. have been tried and found with certain curative effect in vitro. However, the clinical drug response is not very encouraging and toxicity remains an inevitable issue causing serious adverse effects 11 . This prompted us to study the inhibition of COVID-19 protease by Indian herbal plants.",

Giloy (moonseed plant or guduchi) is a large deciduous, extensively spreading climbing shrub found throughout India and also in Bangladesh, Srilanka and China. Aloe vera (ghrit kumari) is a well known medicinal plant with sharp pointed, lanced shaped and edged leaves having its origin in African content, Turmeric (circumin or haldi), a traditional Chinese medicine, is commonly used species in Indian subcontinent, not only for health but also for the preservation of food. Ashwagandha is known as Indian winter cherry. Neem (margosa tree) also called as Indian lilac with its centre of origin in southern and southeastern Asia, is regarded as \"village dispensary\" in India and also a religious gift from nature. Red onion is a versatile vegetable, i.e., consumed fresh as well as in the form of processed products. Tulsi is the one of the most religious and medicinal plant in India and grown throughout the country from Andaman and Nicobar island to the Himalayas. Cannabis is a plant of psychoactive drug and black pepper is a kind of household species used in India. In order to compare the biological activity and pharmacological behavior of the extracted compounds, we have evaluated their log P as well as log S values and listed in Table 1 . Log P measures the hydrophilicity of a compound. The compounds having high log P values show poor absorption or low permeability. One can note that the log P values of most of these compounds lie in the range 2.64-4.95. These values indicate that the compounds can easily diffuse across the cell membranes due to their high organic (lipid) permeability. However, lupeol, sitosterol, ursolic acid and cannabidiol have log P in the range 5.12-7.27 (exceeding to 5) and therefore, they possess high hydrophobicity and poor absorption. On the contrary, nictoflorin, astragalin, aloenin, aloesin and quercetin possess high absorption due to their log P in the range 0.05-1.81.",

Most of these compounds have log S values higher than -5, except lupeol, sitosterol and ursolic acid. Note that the log S values of more than 85% of compounds (drugs) fall in the range between -1 and -5 21 . This is consistent with their log P values as poor solubility implies poor absorption and hence, bioavailability. Thus, log P along with log S values of these compounds confirmed their permeability across cell membranes. In particular, the nictoflorin, astragalin, aloenin, aloesin and quercetin seem to be more biologically potent. These parameters are also associated with their interaction with receptors. The molecular docking studies explore the interaction mechanism between ligands and receptors. The interactions between a ligand and receptor play a crucial role in the field of drug discovery. The molecular docking calculations have been performed as blind, i.e., covered the entire protein surface, not any specific region of the protein as the binding pocket in order to avoid sampling bias. The docking parameters such as binding affinity, FF score, and H-bond, bond-length along with amino acids (residue) found in the binding site pockets (active site) of 6LU7 are listed in Table 1 .
