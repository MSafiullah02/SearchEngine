            "text": "Pulmonary fibroblasts have now been recognized as an active participant during inflammatory processes in the lung, playing a specialized role in the recruitment and regulation of immune cells that infiltrate the interstitial space. Through their regulatory mechanisms, lung fibroblasts generate many kinds of chemokines and cytokines, including IL-8, eotaxin 1, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES, and GM-CSF, upon activation with inflammatory stimulants [1], [2], [3]. IL-8 (CXCL8) is one of the major chemokines with neutrophil chemotactic activity [4], and is produced by a variety of cells including lung fibroblasts activated with various stimulants [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. On the other hand, eotaxin 1 (CCL11) was originally isolated as the predominant eosinophil chemoattractant in the lung lavage fluid of sensitized guinea pigs after allergic exposure and was cloned in 1996 by Kitaura et al. [9], [10]. Eotaxin 1 can be produced by several types of cells, including lung or dermal fibroblasts [11], [12], [13], and lung or bronchial epithelial cells [13], [14], [15]. Production of eotaxin 1 is induced by IL-4 and suppressed by IFN-\u03b3 [11], [13], and it is recognized that eotaxin 1 is responsible for the infiltration of eosinophils into allergic inflammatory sites [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].",

For the past few decades, the GL preparation Stronger-Neo Minophagen C (SNMC) has extensively been used to treat chronic hepatitis in Japan [16], [17], and the safety and efficacy of SNMC have been established. SNMC is now under clinical trial in Europe in patients with chronic hepatitis C [18], [19]. So far, GL has been demonstrated to have a variety of activities, such as the production of several cytokines, namely IFN-\u03b3 [20], IL-2 [21], IL-12 [22], and IL-10 [23], and the augmentation of NK cell/NKT cell activity [24]. Also, GL administration induces anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective effects in vivo and anti-viral effects in vitro [25]. Some other pharmacological effects of GL and related compounds have been demonstrated [26], [27], [28].",

            "text": "In early 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raged in several countries and the event shook the world. Surprisingly, it was promptly reported that GL was effective against SARS-associated coronavirus [29]. A subsequent paper reported that an elevation of plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was observed in SARS patients [30]. Taking these reports into consideration, we presumed that GL may act against the production of chemokines in the lung. However, the effect of GL on chemokine production by lung constituent cells remains to be identified.",

In view of the structure\u2013activity relationships among GLs, GAs, and MGAs, glucuronic acid had different effects on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 generation. 18\u03b1,\u03b2-GL inhibited IL-8 production in a gradual dose dependent manner, and 18\u03b1-GL showed inhibitory effect on eotaxin 1 production. However, mRNA level was not well correlated with the amount of chemokines. Therefore, 18\u03b1,\u03b2-GL may regulate the chemokines production also by the posttranscriptional level like at the protein secretion or degradation. Further experiments are needed to explore in more detail. When one molecule of glucuronic acid was removed from GLs, MGAs did not show significant differences in IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production, but cytotoxicity increased with a CC30 of more than 100 \u03bcg/ml compared with more than 1000 \u03bcg/ml by 18\u03b1,\u03b2-GL. Moreover, when two molecules of glucuronic acid were removed from GLs, GAs indicated rather different actions on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production. That is, while GAs did not show any inhibitory action against IL-8 production up to 10 \u03bcg/ml, GAs showed inhibitory effect of eotaxin 1 production at less than 10 \u03bcg/ml, with increasing cytotoxicity at more than 30 \u03bcg/ml. The results of both IL-8 and eotaxin 1 mRNA expression at 10 \u03bcg/ml were not necessarily corresponded with the result of ELISA. The reasons for this remain unclear. This concentration seems to be close to the cytotoxic concentration, so the effects of GAs on the protein level or mRNA level might be unstable. Alternatively, the timing at which eotaxin 1 production starts is later than that of IL-8, so this kinetic difference may reflect the different effects of GAs. As for the stereospecificity of the C18 position, there were no great differences between 18\u03b1- and 18\u03b2-compounds except for eotaxin 1 production; 18\u03b1-GL has a much stronger effect on eotaxin 1 production than 18\u03b2-GL.",

Comparing the effects of 11-deoxo-GL, homo-GL, and hetero-GL which were modified at C-11 and C-18, 11-deoxo-GL and hetero-GL indicated strong inhibition at 100 \u03bcg/ml but cytotoxicity arose simultaneously. Hetero-GL is a previously reported compound that has inhibitory action against HIV and herpes simplex virus replication [26]. Therefore, the pharmacological potency of hetero-GL can be expected, but we found that the range of efficacy and toxicity is narrow. We demonstrated here that the effect of homo-GL on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production was weaker than that of 11-deoxo-GL and hetero-GL but with less cytotoxicity. As the effect of homo-GL on eotaxin 1 production, mRNA level was not correlated with the protein level. Homo-GL also may modulate eotaxin 1 production by the porttranscriptional level as well as GLs. Moreover, as for hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL (group 5), modified compounds of hetero-GL and homo-GL at the C-30 position, both compounds showed moderate inhibitory activity against IL-8 and eotaxin 1 expression. That is, the IC50 of hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL against IL-8 and eotaxin 1 was lower than that of GLs and the cytotoxicity was less than that of hetero-GL. In terms of IC50, homo-30-OH-GL (IC50 for IL-8 was 60 \u03bcg/ml and IC50 for eotaxin 1 was 12.5 \u03bcg/ml) was superior to homo-GL. These results suggest that the reduction of the carboxyl group at C-30 may augment the inhibitory activity without changing the cytotoxicity. Taken collectively, modification of GLs at the C-11 and C-18 positions may augment the activity of GLs.",

            "text": "GL has been used widely and effectively as a treatment for chronic hepatitis [16], [19]. Furthermore, GL has been described as an anti-viral agent against many kinds of viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 [37], HIV [38], human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [39], influenza virus [40], SARS-associated coronavirus [29], etc. Murayama et al. [41] demonstrated that IL-8 enhanced human CMV replication in human lung fibroblasts. Also, an elevation of IL-8 was observed in SARS patients [30]. Thus, it seems that there is a close connection between viral infection and IL-8 production in the lung. In addition, IL-8 is known as a significant attractant for inflammatory cells in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [42]. Therefore, the results of our study that GL and related compounds reduced IL-8 generation in human lung fibroblasts explain the activity of these anti-inflammatory drugs against lung diseases. Eotaxin 1 is thought to be a potent eosinophil chemotactic factor, recruiting eosinophils into the airways after allergic stimulation. This notion is supported by some in vivo experiments [9], [43]. Moreover, the correlation between eotaxin and eosinophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage of asthmatic patients has been identified [44]. In this study, we demonstrated that GL derivatives had inhibitory capacity against eotaxin 1 production caused by TNF-\u03b1 plus IL-4 stimulation in lung fibroblasts. These results would imply that GL derivatives could be useful as anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory agents in lung eosinophilic diseases like asthma. GL also has the ability to enhance Th1 cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 [20], IL-2 [21], and IL-12 [22] and to modulate Th2 cytokines, IL-10 enhancement [23], or IL-4 reduction in CD4+ T cells [34]. Because the generation of eotaxin 1 is induced by IL-4 and is suppressed by IFN-\u03b3 [11], [13], GL-related compounds may improve allergic and inflammatory lung diseases not only by inhibiting proinflammatory chemokine production but also by shifting the Th1 axis. Although GL needed high doses i.e., \u223c1 mg/ml to inhibit IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production, we demonstrated that other GL-related compounds, especially hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL, are effective at much lower doses (less than 100 \u03bcg/ml). Thus, we assume that these compounds are more beneficial from the perspectives of their inhibitory concentration and cytotoxicity.",
