These laboratory data are traditionally used by public health agencies to identify the presence of influenza activity \u2013 based on exceeding case or proportion positive test thresholds \u2013 and to characterize circulating strains, but there are good reasons why they are not used to identify levels of influenza activity.",

Heightened awareness of influenza and other respiratory infections have led to increased requests for testing. Given the increased attention in recent years to both interpandemic and pandemic influenza, as well as emerging diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is not surprising that more tests for influenza may be ordered by physicians and public health professionals in their diagnostic work-up of patients with acute respiratory illnesses and investigations of respiratory outbreaks, respectively.",

This figure plots weekly surveillance data (obtained from the same source as Groll and Thomson) for influenza A and B for Ontario from 1993 to 2004, and compares the number of tests performed for influenza (using viral culture or direct antigen detection) with the number of cases of lab-confirmed influenza. Annual peaks corresponding to influenza season are apparent for both number of tests performed and number of cases. It is also fairly evident that number of tests performed for influenza have increased over time, with a sudden increase coinciding with and persisting since the SARS outbreak that occurred in Ontario in the spring of 2003 [3], [4]. The increase in numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases seen over time parallels the increase in number of tests performed.",

This is illustrated in Fig. 2\n, which compares the number of cases of lab-confirmed influenza with the proportion of tests for influenza that were positive. Again, annual peaks corresponding to influenza season are evident for both number of cases and proportion of tests positive. However, the peaks for the proportion of tests positive are fairly consistent over time, varying between 0.15 and 0.45, whereas the peaks for the number of cases increase dramatically over time, from less than 50 to over 1000 cases per week. The relative consistency of the proportion of tests positive over time coupled with the increase in lab-confirmed cases suggests that the increase in lab-confirmed cases is attributable to more tests being performed.",

For December 2003, there were 2394 cases of influenza reported out of a population of 12,256,645 as of 1 July 2003. This would be a monthly incidence of 195 per 1,000,000 cases and accurately reflects the data in the graph. That only 2 cases of influenza per 10,000 people are identified during months of influenza activity, when the actual rates of disease approach 5 per 100 people, further raises concern that any laboratory-derived measures of influenza activity are vulnerable to ascertainment and sampling biases.",
