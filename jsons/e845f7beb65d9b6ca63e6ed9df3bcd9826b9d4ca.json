For every increase of 112 in serum myoglobin levels, mortality increased by 3.15% in generalized estimation equation analysis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the optimal myoglobin cut-off value was 306.5 \u03bcg/L (Youden's index=0.426). The area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (95%CI: 0.68-0.95, p=0.003). The sensitivity was 60.6% while specificity was 82% (Fig. 1) . In the subgroup analyses, the values of cardiac biomarkers in elderly subjects (>65 years) with cardiovascular disease were significantly higher than ones in elderly without cardiovascular disease and young patients. In the early period, serum levels of myoglobin and CK-MB had a strong negative correlation with hs-CRP.",

Our results indicated that an elevated serum concentration of myoglobin (\u2265306.5\u03bcg/L) was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization mortality in non-survivors, independent of elevation in CK-MB and Troponin I. We found that cut-off (\u2265306.5\u03bcg/L) of myoglobin was high. In the context of 2019-nCOV, the deceased with NCIP usually had concurrent refractory hypoxia, hypotension and reduced renal perfusion, which may result in increased skeletal muscle and heart release of myoglobin. 5 Particularly, elderly (>65years) non-survivor patients with cardiovascular diseases had more severe cardiac injury. Accordingly, we suggest that: firstly, in addition to the protection of the lungs first, the time window of therapeutic interventions about cardiac injury should be as early as possible for severe patients; secondly, inflammatory factor release should be blocked early, especially in elderly (>65 years) patients with cardiovascular diseases.",
