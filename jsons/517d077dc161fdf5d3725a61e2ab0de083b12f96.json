Most research in BD has restricted the detection of infectious stigma to IgG antibodies, which are informative of a previous exposure but not able to identify the particular period of that exposure. These studies are thus insufficient to demonstrate that infections predate the diagnosis of BD, leaving open the possibility that they might even have occurred after onset.

Parboosing et al (23) , suggested that influenza during pregnancy increased the risk of BD in offspring by a factor of approximately 4 [OR: 3.82 (95% CI: 1.58-9.24)]. A key advantage of this study is that the infection was measured long prior to onset of BD, indicating that BD was not a consequence of influenza exposure. Moreover, Benros et al. (24) , in a population-based analysis in Denmark, have shown that a previous hospitalization for an infectious disease was associated with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.55-1.68) for a subsequent BD diagnosis.

These observations may partly explain the premature mortality in BD, with rates comparable to those of a heavy smoker (33) , leaving aside other potential contributors namely risk behaviours, delays in seeking care and/or low adherence to treatment (34-37). One mechanism currently proposed for how these infections can increase the risk of BD is the existence of a defective systemic immune/inflammatory response that interferes with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral immune system (20) .

Only recently has dysfunction of the immune system become a subject of interest in BD, with studies suggesting that this phenomenon may be under genetic control (5, 44, 45) .

When considered jointly with the results regarding the TLR2, TLR4 and IL6 genes, these findings, although conflicting, suggest that feeble proinflammatory responses, potentially associated with pathogen escape, may be linked to an earlier onset of BD. The CCL2, also referred to as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and belonging to the CC chemokine family, has also been studied. The CCL2 rs1024611 (\u00c02518 A>G) polymorphism, affecting the transcriptional activity of the distal regulatory region with functional impact on monocyte CCL2 production, has been analysed in four studies. In only one study, genotype and allelic distributions were found to be significantly heterogeneous, with a higher prevalence of the A allele and AA genotype when comparing BD patients with healthy controls in the Turkish population (72, (81) (82) (83) . Interestingly, in another example of the value of stratification, the prevalence of the low-producer A allele was found to be higher in manic patients as compared with depressed or mixed episode bipolar patients (82, 84) , and a higher frequency of the A allele and AA genotype was found in BD patients compared with patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (81) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 102, "end": 106, "text": "(75)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 236, "end": 240, "text": "(74)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 699, "end": 703, "text": "(76)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "(71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1077, "text": "77)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1531, "text": "(71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1535, "text": "76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "78,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1543, "text": "79)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "(80)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2471, "text": "(72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2476, "text": "(81)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2481, "text": "(82)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2486, "text": "(83)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2701, "end": 2705, "text": "(82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2709, "text": "84)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 2856, "end": 2860, "text": "(81)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modulators of clinical presentation"}, {"text": "Among the inflammation markers, CRP is the most robustly associated with BD (85, 86) .
