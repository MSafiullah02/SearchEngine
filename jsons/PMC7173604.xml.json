Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses) were later identified to be the cause of this illness, named after a diarrhea outbreak amongst elementary school students in Norwalk, Ohio in 1968 (Adler and Zickl, 1969). Noroviruses (NV) were the first viral agents proven to cause GE. They are part of the Calicivirus family. Caliciviruses are single stranded, 37\u201341 nm, nonenveloped RNA viruses (including noroviruses 33\u201340 nm and sapoviruses). Because of the low inoculum needed for transmission, prolonged viral shedding and the ability to survive in the environment, Noroviruses have become major pathogens. They account for 18% of GE worldwide and are now recognized as the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. The CDC estimates that NV causes 19\u201321 million illnesses, 56,000\u201371,000 hospitalizations and between 570 and 800 deaths (CDC, n.d.). The GII strain of NV is the most common. Outbreaks of NV are frequently reported on cruise ships, nursing homes, schools and work places. Outbreaks most often occur in the wintertime, hence the moniker, winter vomiting disease. However, the illness does occur throughout the year, impacting older children and adults. NV GE has a short incubation period (IP) of 12\u201348 h, and typically causes acute onset nausea, vomiting and diarrhea which lasting under 48 h. However, viral shedding can be prolonged for weeks, even in asymptomatic persons (Robilotti et al., 2015). Some children and chronically immune suppressed persons may experience prolonged diarrhea.",

NV is not inactivated by alcohol based hand sanitizers. Factors which contribute to the explosive nature of these outbreaks, include close contacts and restricted settings, the high infectivity of NV, NV's environmental persistence, prolonged viral shedding and a lack of long-lived host immunity.

The genome consists of 11 segments coding for 6 structural (VP1\u20134, VP6 and VP7) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NSP 1\u20136). The virus is made up of 3 concentric shells, an outer (VP4\u2014P protein and VP7-G protein) and inner capsid (VP6) and core. The P and G proteins define the specific serotype and induce protective neutralizing antibodies (Blacklow and Greenberg, 1991). On electron microscopy, rotavirus appears to have a well-defined central core with radiating spokes, hence the name \u201crota\u201d (wheel-like) virus. RVs are classified into groups (A\u2013F based on VP6) and serotypes based on VP7 and VP4 proteins. Group A viruses are the most common and are the only group which cause human disease. Though there are at least 15 different serotypes, most VGE is due to serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9. Rotaviruses are extremely stable in the environment and are not eliminated by hand washing.",

They are found throughout the world and were the most common cause of severe diarrhea amongst infants and young children in the United States before the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2006. Prior to the rotavirus vaccine, nearly all US children were infected with rotavirus by age 5 accounting for significant morbidity: with in excess of 200,000 ER visits, 55,000\u201370,000 hospitalizations and 20\u201360 annual deaths (Rotavirus, n.d.). Worldwide, RV remains the most common VGE affecting children. The peak incidence of RV is between 3 months when maternal antibody levels of protection may wane with most infants impacted at age 2. Similar to NV, RV is shed in high concentrations in stool and is easily transmitted within households. Prior to introducing the RV vaccine in the USA, RV was seasonal, with its peak in the winter from November\u2013April. In the vaccine era, RV GE has become more sporadic. Rotavirus infection can be asymptomatic or symptomatic with an incubation period of 1\u20133 days and illness lasting for 5\u20137 days.

All are ingested orally and target different cells within the upper gastrointestinal tract. Recent discoveries using enteroid and murine models for NV have advanced the understanding of how these viruses interact with mammalian hosts. Factors important in NV pathogenesis include: their attachment to HBGA\u2019s, tissue and cellular tropism of the virus, the host immune response and the host gut microbiota (deGraaf et al., 2016). In murine models, NV appears to infect both enterocytes and immune cells. Infection of enterocytes has not been shown in humans. It appears that NV target human immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T-cells. Murine NV can be transcytosed across intestinal epithelial cells in culture via microfold (M-) cells without productive infection or disruption of tight junctions (Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2013). These M cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that sample particulate antigens, in the lumen of the host to deliver them to the underlying immune cells. NV exploits this pathway, to pass through the intestinal epithelium and reach their immune target cells without harming enterocytes.",

In certain cell types, \u03b1 (1, 2)-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2; also known as galactoside 2-\u03b1-l-fucosyltransferase 2) adds a fucose group to precursors of HBGAs, generating various HBGAs (deGraaf et al., 2016). The binding specificity of norovirus VP1 to different HBGAs varies between norovirus genotypes and is a determinant of susceptibility to specific NV strains. Nonsecretors, lacking FUT2 are less susceptible to NV infection with GI and GII strains.Commensal gut bacteria expressing HBGAs also play a role in B-cell infection by NV (Karst, 2016). Antimicrobial treatment of the gut microbiota in mice reduces NV replication (Jones et al., 2014). Repletion of these, restores NV infectivity. In addition, the commensal gut bacteria suppress the antiviral activity of type III interferon which allows persistence of NV within the colon (Baldridge et al., 2015). This mechanism may allow persistence and prolonged viral shedding. The mechanism for NV induced vomiting may be due to delayed emptying, from abnormal gastric motor function.",

            "text": "Though more is known about rotaviruses, its pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood. The diarrhea is believed to be multifactorial due to malabsorption, the rotavirus enterotoxin and secretion triggered by activation of the enteric nervous system. RV particles are ingested, and trypsin cleaves the spike protein VP4 into two terminal fragments VP8 and VP5. The VP8 contains a hemagglutinin domain whereas the VP5 a beta-barrel domain which interact with the membranes of small intestinal enterocytes. This interaction is mediated via VP8\u2019s interactions with sialic acid-containing and nonsialylated receptor molecules (HBGAs). RV is internalized and the outer capsid is lost, activating the virion-associated transcriptase and viral macromolecular synthases. Viral proteins and RNAs concentrate in cytoplasmic structures called viroplasms, where RNA replication and packaging take place. Intracellular events, probably involving (nonstructural protein 4) NSP4, the RV enterotoxin trigger the release of Ca2 + from the endoplasmic reticulum (Lundgren and Svensson, 2001). The NSP4 viroporin domain is a calcium-conducting ion channel. The increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration begins a cascade of cellular processes, including disruption of the microvillar cytoskeletal network, lowered expression of disaccharidases and other enzymes at the apical surface, general inhibition of the Na+-solute cotransport systems, and necrosis. NSP4 appears to be released specifically by a Ca2 +-dependent, nonclassical secretion pathway prior to cell lysis. These events lead to a malabsorption component of the diarrhea through reduction in absorptive capacity of the epithelium, reduced activity of Na+-solute cotransporters, and reduction of digestive enzyme expression on the epithelial surface (Hagborn et al., 2012). Development of serum and mucosal antibodies against VP4 and VP7 may protect from disease. The ENS also plays a role in RV disease. Inhibition of serotonin receptors and enkephalinases may reduce the secretory component of diarrhea. Additionally, the ENS may be associated with the hypermotility and vomiting via nitric oxide pathways.",

Before the era of rapid nucleic acid testing, diagnostic testing and differentiation was principally done for epidemiological purposes. However, stool testing should be done in those with alarm symptoms/signs (severe dehydration, renal and electrolyte dysfunction, severe abdominal pain, symptoms > 1 week, age > 65, immunocompromised, pregnant, bloody stools) or in outbreaks. With the widespread use of antigen and molecular diagnostics, many of these can be identified. Specific stool antigen tests are available to identify Rotavirus and Noroviruses. For rotavirus, the stool EIA antigen is widely available. Multiplex PCR testing on stool samples can rapidly identify bacterial, viral and protozoa associated with diarrheal illness.",

Though effective, postmarketing surveillance indicated an increased incidence of intussusception 3\u201320 days after vaccine administration. This vaccine was removed from the market in 1999 and replaced in 2006 with RotaTeq (RV5 Merck) and Rotarix (RV1GSK), live oral reassortment (RotaTeq 5 viruses; Rotarix, 1 strain) vaccines. The RotaTeq vaccine is given in three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and achieves a 98% reduction in severe RGE, 74% against any severity GE in the first year and a 96% reduction in hospitalizations. Rotarix is a two dose vaccine given as oral drops at 2, 4 months.
