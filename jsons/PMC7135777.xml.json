Since 1990, the aid policies of industrialised countries has tended to restrict the public sector's functions to mere disease control. On the grounds of the private sector's supposed higher efficiency, this policy recommends marketing of curative care together with prioritisation of disease control within the public sector.2 GATS article 1.3.c. makes this recommendation compulsory: \u201ca service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers\u201d. It could be invoked by powerful health services companies in countries with a weak bargaining position, to prevent publicly oriented services from receiving government subsidies or oblige subsidised public services to limit their activities to disease control.",

It provides the legal basis to preclude integration of disease control with general practice. Nevertheless, many commentators stress the convenience of integrating programmes into health facilities to achieve a reasonable prospect of successful disease control.4 Such integration requires structures with patients, as journalists noticed while analysing causes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China.5 These patients, consulting for various symptoms, represent a pool of users that disease control programmes need for early case detection and sufficient coverage.",
