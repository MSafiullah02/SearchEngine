The BCV genome encodes three membrane glycoproteins, the integral membrane protein (M), the spike protein (S), and the hemagglutinin\u2013esterase (HE) (King and Brian, 1982). The S and HE proteins are major membrane associated glycoproteins and induce virus neutralizing antibodies (Deregt et al., 1989). The monoclonal antibodies raised against the HE protein neutralize the infectivity of BCV under cell culture conditions and protected the intestinal epithelia of cattle from the virus infection (Deregt and Babiuk, 1987). In addition, the immunogenicity of a recombinant human adenovirus-5 (HAV-5) expressing the HE gene was tested in cotton rats (Baca-Estrada et al., 1995). Although HAV-5 based vectors (expressing vaccine antigens from different bovine pathogens) have been used to test the efficacy and immunogenicity of protective antigens in experimental animals (Baca-Estrada et al., 1995, Breker-Klassen et al., 1995, Papp et al., 1997), their use as recombinant vaccines in cattle is limited due to their broad host range, which creates regulatory concerns.",

            "text": "In recent years, the idea of using bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) as a vector (Baxi et al., 1999, Reddy et al., 1999, Zakhartchouk et al., 1998) for delivery of protective antigen from pathogens of cattle has received considerable attention. Deletion of the non-essential E3 region has facilitated construction of replication-competent BAV-3 vectors expressing authentic and truncated forms of glycoprotein D (gD) of bovine herpes virus-1 (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). During infection of bovine cell lines, such recombinant BAVs produced large amounts of glycoprotein gD (a DNA virus gene), which has been shown to undergo proper post-translational modifications (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). In addition, intranasal inoculation of calves with these recombinants has been shown to be safe and efficacious, making these vectors particularly attractive for vaccination of cattle (Zakhartchouk et al., 1999). However, similar attempts to obtain high levels of expression of HE gene of bovine corona virus in a replication-competent BAV-3 vector (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998) without any flanking upstream or downstream sequences have been unsuccessful. Since the level of expression of an antigen may determine the quality of immune response in animals immunized orally or intranasally with recombinant adenoviruses, it is necessary to maximize the expression of a vaccine antigen. In addition, as the development of a quality immune response would correlate with levels of antigen produced by the recombinant adenovirus vectors, we investigated ways of increasing HE gene expression in the BAV-3 expression system. The main reason to choose BCV HE gene was that it has been difficult to over express HE using a variety of heterologous expression systems (unpublished data). In addition, BCV causes neonatal diarrhea in calves resulting in significant economic losses due to mortality and decreased productivity of the survivors. Since currently available vaccines against BCV are not effective (Waltner-Toews et al., 1995), better vaccines are needed to reduce the economic losses.",

This transfer vector has an overlap of 1992 bp on the left side and 889 bp on the right side of the E3 region for homologous recombination in E. coli BJ 5183 with the E3 deleted full-length clone pFBAV-302 (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). To increase the overlap, initially the KpnI-SspI fragment representing the right side of the BAV-3 genome between nt 24464 and 34060 was introduced into KpnI and blunt-ended NotI sites of pPOLYII sn 14 to generate a plasmid, pBAV-299. The region spanning the KpnI and XbaI sites of pBAV-299 was replaced with that of pBAV-300 to generate pBAV-301. The plasmid pBAV-301 can be digested with KpnI (nt 24464) and SpeI (nt 31570) enzymes and the gel purified fragment can be used for homologous recombination in E. coli BJ 5183. This new transfer vector has two unique restriction enzyme sites (SrfI and SalI) for cloning of foreign genes and an overlap of 1992 bp on the left side and 3866 bp on the right side of the E3 region for efficient homologous recombination with plasmid pFBAV-302 (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998), which dramatically increased the frequency of recombination in BJ 5183 cells.",

The full length HE gene alone or with different exogenous transcriptional elements was inserted individually into the E3 region of plasmid pFBAV302 in the same transcriptional orientation of E3 using homologous recombination in E. coli (Chariter et al., 1996). The Pac-I digested pFBAV303, pFBAV332, pFBAV333 or pFBAV334 plasmid DNA was transfected into VIDO R2 cells (transformed fetal bovine retina cells). The infected monolayers showing 50% cytopathic effects were collected, freeze thawed and recombinant viruses were plaque purified and propagated in MDBK cells. The recombinant viruses were named BAV303 (HE without exogenous elements), BAV332 (HE with chimeric intron), BAV333 (HE with SV40 promoter, chimeric intron and SV40 polyA) and BAV334 (HE with CMV promoter, chimeric intron, SV40 polyA) (Fig. 1\n). The viral DNA was extracted from infected cells by the Hirt method (Hirt, 1967) and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with BamHI restriction enzyme. The digestion of wild type BAV-3 viral DNA with BamHI yields five fragments and the fragment D (3.019 kb) contains the E3 region (Fig. 2\nA, lane 1). The difference in the size of modified BamHI \u2018D\u2019 fragment of BAV3.E3d (Fig. 2A, lane 2) BAV303 (Fig. 2A, lane 3), BAV332 (Fig. 2A, lane 4), BAV333 (Fig. 2A, lane 5) and BAV334 (Fig. 2A, lane 6) was as expected. This was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of BamHI digested genomic DNA of wild type and recombinant BAV3s. As seen in the Fig. 2B, the same modified BamHI \u2018D\u2019 fragment (s) from the recombinant viruses hybridized to \u03b1-32P dCTP labeled HE gene in the Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 2B, lanes 3,4,5,6).

The RNA was separated on agarose\u2013formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membrane and probed with the \u03b1\n32P labeled HE gene The probe was expected to detect four L6 mRNAs (100 K, 33 K, 23 K and pVIII) and the mRNAs of HE transcribed from the E3 promoter and MLP. Unlike in HAV-2 (Ziff and Fraser, 1978), the transcripts from the L6 region in BAV-3 are polyadenylated at the poly(A) site of the E3 region (Reddy et al., 1998). Thus, all the transcripts of L6 region originating from the major late promoter (MLP) form a nested set of overlapping molecules with common 3' ends. Each mRNA contains all the sequences in the next smaller mRNA plus one additional ORF at the 5' end. Only the ORF at the 5' end of the mRNA is translated. When RNA was analyzed, several abundant mRNAs were identified that had HE sequences in them particularly in RNA that was extracted at 28 h postinfection (Fig. 3\n). At 28 h postinfection, the larger transcripts were the dominant species of RNA extracted from BAV303 (lane 2) and BAV333 (lane 6) infected cells. During early stages of HAV-5 infection, the E3 promoter is used to express mRNAs from the E3 region and during late stages, transcription from the E3 promoter is reduced and some mRNAs are made from the MLP (Tollefson et al., 1992). The major late E3 mRNAs containing tripartite leader sequences are also produced in BAV-3 (Idamakanti et al., 1999). Since the sizes of the transcripts were considerably larger than the genomic distance between the E3 promoter and poly(A) site of the E3 region, they must have been generated by splicing of the primary transcripts produced from the MLP.",

The promoter of the E3 is located within the coding sequence of the pVIII and shares its poly(A) site with the L6 (Idamakanti et al., 1999). Recently, we have developed a replication-competent BAV-3 vector with a 1.245 kb deletion in the E3 region, removing all E3 open reading frames, leaving the E3 promoter, 5\u2032 intiation site, and the poly(A) site intact (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). Recombinant BAV-3 expressed high levels of full length or truncated forms of glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 when the genes coding for these proteins were introduced into the E3 region in the same orientation as the E3 transcription unit without any exogenous transcription control elements (Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). However, when the cDNAs representing the protective antigen from RNA viruses including BCV were inserted into the E3 region of BAV-3, no expression of the proteins was obtained (unpublished observation). In an attempt to optimize the expression of RNA virus genes in the BAV-3 expression system, we have constructed and characterized four recombinant viruses carrying the HE gene of BCV (with or without exogenous transcription control elements).",

If a RNA virus gene is to be expressed through a recombinant adenoviral vector system, its mRNA must be free of any cryptic splice sites or else the message could be broken into pieces by the splicing machinery present in the cell nucleus. This can be prevented either by swapping codons to remove internal splice sites (expensive) or by inserting an intron upstream of the cDNA. Since transfection studies have demonstrated that an intron flanking the cDNA insert frequently increases the level of cDNA expression (Huang and Gorman, 1990), it was hypothesized that introduction of an intron upstream of a cDNA could prevent utilization of possible cryptic 5\u2032-donor splice sites within the cDNA sequence (Huang and Gorman, 1990). Addition of poly(A)+ [e.g. SV40 late poly(A) signal] has also been shown to enhance RNA stability and translation (Carswell and Alwine, 1989, Jackson and Standart, 1990). However, the size of the poly(A) and the intron should be minimal as its inclusion will reduce the ultimate capacity of the adenovirus vector. The intron A, which is most widely used to express cDNAs is about 800 bp in length and will reduce the size limit of foreign DNA that can be put into BAV-3 vectors.",

Addition of a chimeric intron and SV40 poly(A)+ signal dramatically increased the levels of HE gene expression. From the size of majority of mRNAs, it appears that the HE transcripts must have initiated from the major late promoter (MLP). It seems likely that the chimeric intron provided the strong splice acceptor site. Consistent with this speculation is the fact that synthesis of HE was observed late (36 h) after infection, when much of the transcription occurs from MLP.",

It seems likely that early HE transcripts must have been initiated from the BAV-3 E3 promoter or SV40/HCMV promoter. Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that (a) HE specific mRNAs of smaller size are abundant in BAV333 and BAV334 infected cells; (b) BAV-3 E3 284R protein expressed from the E3 promoter can be detected at 24 h but not at 12 h post infection (Idamakanti et al., 1999).

Expression of the HE was seen as early as 6 h postinfection and produced throughout the infection. However, BAV-3 differs from HAV-5 with respect to replication kinetics. In BAV-3 infected cells, viral DNA replication begins at about 24 h postinfection and reaches a peak after 40 h, whereas viral DNA replication in HAV-5 infected cells occurs as early as 12 h postinfection (Niiyama et al., 1975). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was noticed at 12 h postinfection when the gene for GFP was placed under the control of CMV immediate early promoter in the E3 region of BAV-3 (Reddy et al., 1999). This suggests that kinetics of foreign gene expression from the E3 region of BAV-3 may be influenced not only by exogenous transcriptional elements but also by the nature of the foreign gene.",
