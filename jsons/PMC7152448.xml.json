They must be delivered to the respiratory tract of laboratory animals in a way that parallels the likely human exposure. In case of therapeutic agents, this should avoid non-respiratory pathways through the skin and food.",

Soluble substances are absorbed into the blood stream and are removed by the pulmonary circulation. They may also undergo metabolism by enzymes present in the cell populations of the respiratory tract and reactive metabolites may cause local pulmonary damage. Insoluble, inert particles are removed primarily by the mucociliary transport system of the trachea and bronchi or through phagocytosis by macrophages. Overload of the lung by even relatively inert, non-fibrous particles such as titanium dioxide or carbon black may impair alveolar macrophage-mediated particle clearance.12 This may lead in turn to accumulation of dusts over time with eventual fibrotic and tumorigenic responses, particularly in rats.13\n",

Although dissection is required, a similar procedure following decalcification can be adopted. Careful examination of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections remains paramount in the assessment of the nasal cavity, although special stains may be helpful. Examination of cytokeratin expression in the respiratory mucosa has been used as a marker of epithelial differentiation in the respiratory tract.43\n",

Although the degree of histological changes varied with different agents, the changes were broadly similar in type and distribution.51 Most agents examined produced little or no alteration in the squamous mucosa lining the anterior part of the nose apart from some mild increase in thickness of the squamous layers. Principal sites of damage were shown to be the anterior respiratory epithelium adjacent to the vestibule and the olfactory epithelium of the dorsal meatus. There was a distinct decrease in severity in posterior regions. Histologically, the lesions in respiratory epithelium ranged from mild loss of cilia and small areas of epithelial exfoliation to frank erosion, ulceration and necrosis of the epithelium and underlying tissues including bone. Variable polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was also found. In some cases, early squamous metaplasia developed on the free margins or the naso-maxillo-turbinates. Changes to the olfactory epithelium varied from focal to extensive loss of sensory cells associated with damage to sustentacular cells. In severe cases, complete loss of olfactory epithelium occurred. Although the degree of histological change was shown to vary with different agents, lesions induced by the more water-soluble chemicals tended to remain localized in the anterior part of the nasal cavity whereas agents with relatively low water solubility produced lung lesions in addition. It was suggested that these findings demonstrated the powerful \u2018scrubbing\u2019 action of the nasal cavity for water soluble, airborne xenobiotics.52\n",

There was also damage to Bowman's glands. The development of proliferative lesions and ultimately tumours of principally neuroectodermal origin followed chronic treatment. As RP73401 was highly metabolized and the nasal lesions could be inhibited by treatment of rats with metyrapone, a non-specific inhibitor of cytochromes P450, it was postulated that the changes were the result of P450-mediated activation in the olfactory tissues, not linked to its pharmacological phosphodiesterase activity.54\n",

Spontaneous nasal tumours are uncommon but most often squamous in type in rats whereas in mice spontaneous squamous tumours are extremely rare and haemangiomas and respiratory adenomas predominate.65,\n66 The generally agreed categories are described below:\nMucous (goblet) cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia affects the nasal respiratory epithelium and are characterized by the presence of enlarged mucus-filled goblet cells, some of which form clusters suggestive on intraepithial glands.\nSquamous cell hyperplasia is seen in the stratified squamous epithelium of the nares and is characterized by a focal increase in the number of cell layers. Cells may show atypia with irregular enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei and nucleoli.\nSquamous metaplasia occurs to respiratory epithelium under conditions of chronic damage. It is characterized histologically by the presence of three or more layers of epithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and clear cell boundaries whereas advanced lesions show typical keratinization and formation of intercellular bridges. Cellular atypia may also be seen and should be characterized when found.\nRespiratory epithelial metaplasia (of the olfactory epithelium) represents atrophy and degeneration of the olfactory epithelium with loss of sensory cells and in advanced cases loss of sustentacular cells with replacement by ciliated and non-ciliated respiratory epithelium. It may be seen as a spontaneous focal lesion in aged rats.\nEpithelial hyperplasia with cellular atypia (atypical hyperplasia, basal cell hyperplasia, dysplasia) is a term used to embrace proliferative lesions in the respiratory and olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity in which there is varying degrees of altered differentiation and atypia. There is perturbation of the growth pattern of the epithelium such that the changes are not those found in the normal regenerative response to transient mucosal damage.\nAdenomas (polypoid or villous adenoma, adenomatous or villous polyp) usually develop in the anterior part of the nasal cavity and are usually exophytic lesions that develop from respiratory epithelium or nasal glands. Adenomas of respiratory epithelium may be papillary in form but are, by definition, well circumscribed with minimal cellular pleomorphism and atypia. They may very occasionally occur spontaneously in aged rats.65 Adenomas of nasal glands usually show an acinar pattern.\nSquamous cell papillomas develop in the squamous epithelium of the nares or in areas of squamous metaplasia in respiratory or olfactory epithelium. They are exophytic lesions with limited connective tissue stroma. They may develop spontaneously in aged rats.67\n\nCarcinomas of either squamous or glandular differentiation develop in the nasal mucosa. Histologically, they have similar characteristics to those in other epithelial tissues. They are rare spontaneous lesions in aged laboratory rodents but may be induced by xenobiotics administered by inhalation, orally or by the parenteral route. Squamous carcinomas have been reported to develop in a small number of untreated Fischer 344 rats used in carcinogenicity studies in association with point mutations in the c-H-ras and c-K-ras gene.67\n\nOlfactory neuroblastoma (ethesioneuroblastoma, olfactory neuroepithelioma, olfactory neuroepithelial carcinoma) show olfactory differentiation and arise from olfactory epithelium. They do not seem to occur as spontaneous lesions in rats or mice and only rarely induced.62,\n65 Cells are arranged in lobules or in solid sheets with scanty stroma. Cells are relatively uniform with scanty cytoplasm with round or oval hyperchromatic nuclei. True rosettes with lumens or pseudorosettes are also seen. Poorly differentiated tumours of this type may require ultrastructural study for diagnosis. Olfactory neuroblastomas typically show the presence of electron-dense neurosecretory granules, neurofilaments or axons. As there is no detailed understanding of the biological behaviour of these neoplasms in laboratory rodents, the generic term olfactory neuroblastoma is usually preferred. They are almost always invasive tumours.65\nOlfactory carcinomas forming glands, follicles and rosettes have been occasionally reported in aged Syrian hamsters.68,\n69\n\nMesenchymal neoplasms may be seen in the nasal cavity, particularly after exposure to potent carcinogens. Their histological features are similar to those in the soft tissues and bone elsewhere in the body (see Chapter 2).\n",

The human lung possesses an upper and lower left lobe and an upper, middle and lower right lobe. This contrasts with the upper, middle and lower left lobes and a fourth, azygos right lobe in rhesus monkeys and baboons.20 The dog has three lobes on both right and left sides.

There are about two T lymphocytes for every three B cells compared with a ratio of 2:5 in rat Peyer's particles.97 The ratios may be different in other species. Quantitative observations of T cell subsets using monoclonal antibodies have also shown that rat BALT normally contains twice as many T-helper as T-suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes.97 The T cells are confined to one or two discrete zones with a light scattering of T cells within the B cell zones and immediately under the bronchial epithelium. In common with lymph nodes, interdigitating cells are also found. The epithelium overlying BALT shows anatomical modifications.

In the Lewis strain this was characterized after 28 days by a variable acute inflammatory exudate in bronchi and bronchioles with focal bronchiectasis, inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium with a predominantly macrophage infiltration of the alveoli and alveolar walls.48,\n113 These changes were associated with marked hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), which extended down the airways and blood vessels towards the periphery of the lungs. Although the lymphoid hyperplasia was also found in inoculated Fischer 344 rats, it was less marked and accompanied by little or no mucopurulent exudate or active inflammation of the bronchial walls.

Sequential studies showed that the initial damage to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium is associated with polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic inflammation (bronchiolitis). Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of viral antigen in the mucosa.112 Hyperplastic and multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells develop in the hyperplastic terminal bronchiolar epithelium and the inflammatory process extended to involve peribronchial or peribronchiolar parenchyma with infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells, macrophages and neutrophils. A similar cell population accompanied by cell debris and oedema fluid develops in air spaces. Pulmonary arteries show only minor involvement with inflammatory cells and focal reactive hyperplasia of the endothelium. Immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural examination suggested that virus replication takes place in alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells and macrophages but not in endothelial or interstitial cells of the alveolar septae.114 It was shown that when repair occurs there may be residual distortion of bronchiolar and alveolar walls by collagen and hyperplastic cuboidal epithelium may line the thickened alveolar septa. Air spaces may also contain enlarged macrophages with pale vacuolated cytoplasm.115 Strain differences in susceptibility have also been demonstrated to this virus. There is differential pulmonary interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene expression between virus-susceptible Brown Norway rats and resistant Fischer 344 rats and IL-12 treatment provides protection from virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and remodelling. Moreover increased tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) expression has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in the development of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis in infected rats.116 Virus-inoculated Brown Norway rats had increased TNF\u03b1 pulmonary mRNA levels and increased numbers of bronchiolar macrophages and fibroblasts expressing TNF\u03b1 protein compared with virus-inoculated F344 rats.117\n",

Both clinical and experimental evidence suggests that impaired cellular immunity is much more important as a predisposing factor than impaired humoral immunity.124 As in humans, laboratory animals may have latent pneumocystis infection that becomes clinically evident following immunosuppression. It has been shown in the rat that chronic administration of various regimens of adenocorticosteroids, low protein diets, cyclophosphamide and other immunosuppressive drugs with concomitant antibiotic administration to prevent other infections gives rise to typical pneumocystis pneumonia.125 Rodents with genetically deficient cellular immunity also develop pneumocystis pneumonia.

Twenty-eight days following intravenous injection of bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the lungs of C57B1/6 mice contained numerous granulomas composed of histiocytes and round cells which were surrounded by alveoli with thickened walls and associated with mild interstitial pneumonitis.134 These histological changes were associated with an increase in the number of Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) cells, especially Lyt-1 (CD5) positive lymphocytes.

Indeed the weight of evidence suggests that drug-induced phospholipidosis per se is an adaptive phenomenon and does not in itself have functional or deleterious consequences unless excessive.183 Hence, the finding of phospholipidosis in animal studies with a novel drug requires careful assessment on a case by case basis with respect to its implications for the safety of humans.",

Lung toxicity continues to be a problem in patients treated for cardiac arrhythmias with this drug.184 Not only does phospholipidosis occur in a wide variety of organs in laboratory animals treated with amiodarone,180,\n185 but also in liver, peripheral nerve cells, skin, lymphoid cells and lungs in patients at therapeutic doses.177,\n186,\n187 Although pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occurs in association with phospholipidosis in patients, amiodarone-induced phospholipidosis in rodents is not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or significant functional alterations. Several theories have been proposed for the pulmonary alveolitis and interstitial fibrosis in humans. The weight of evidence to date suggests that the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes is not causally related to the alveolitis or pulmonary fibrosis.188 Indeed, overall there is little evidence that the mere presence of phospholipidosis is deleterious to the organism.183 Cytotoxicity, possibly through the metabolite desethylamiodarone, has been proposed and an immune-mediated mechanism has been postulated, possibly favoured by the binding of drug to components of pulmonary tissue.187 It might also involve free radical formation or indirect influences on inflammatory mechanisms.184 It is also possible that pulmonary disease results from an interaction of several mechanisms and metabolic factors unique to particular patients.188\n",

Studies from humans have shown that three clinically distinct forms of this condition occur: congenital, secondary or acquired. The congenital disease is caused by a diverse range of mutations in the genes encoding surfactant proteins or the \u03b2c chain of the receptor of granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The secondary form occurs in association with conditions where there is functional impairment or reduced numbers of alveolar macrophages, such as in haematological cancers, following immune suppression or inhalation of silica or toxic fumes. Acquired or idiopathic alveolar proteinosis that accounts for over 90% of all cases (0.37 per 100000 persons) has been an enigma until recently. Patients are at risk from infections, particularly nocardia, and the 5 year survival rate appears to be about 75%. Studies from transgenic mouse models and in humans have shown that autoantibodies against GM-CSF are important in the development of the acquired form of the disease as this antibody causes a defect in macrophages function which impairs the catabolism of surfactant lipids and proteins.196\n",

Florid cases of goblet cell hyperplasia are characterized by thickening and pseudostratification of the tracheal or bronchial mucosa by a population of tall, mucus secreting cells with abundant pale cytoplasm. In addition, goblet cells extend further down the airways than in normal animals and mucus may fill or distend the airways or impact in the alveoli. In less florid cases, a simple increase in the number of goblet cells may be found without other structural change.73 Goblet cell hyperplasia of the lining epithelium may be accompanied by an increase in size of the underlying submucosal glands. This has clearly been demonstrated in patients with chronic bronchitis and in rats where submucosal glands are normally quite prominent.199,\n201 Species differences may exist because the airways of laboratory animals are variably endowed with goblet cells and submucosal mucous glands.

This was associated with an increase in length, width and depth of submucosal glands.203 Similar changes were produced by pilocarpine, although both alcian blue- and PAS-positive cells were increased in number following this agent, suggesting that pilocarpine induced both acid and neutral glycoprotein secretion. Comparison of the distribution of these changes in the rat following isoprenaline, with those of salbutamol, pilocarpine and tobacco smoke, showed that there were regional differences in the distribution of these changes in the airways.204 Isoprenaline produced a greater increase in secretory cells in peripheral airways than tobacco smoke, which itself produces a greater increase in mitotic activity. Isoprenaline and pilocarpine produced a more diffuse change than the more selective \u03b2 agonist, salbutamol. The changes induced by these therapeutic agents are presumably the result of their pharmacological activity.204 Sturgess and Reid showed that the changes in the rat were accompanied by hypertrophy of the pancreas, submaxillary and parotid salivary glands203 (see Digestive System, Chapter 8).",

Some are composed of solid growths of uniform cuboidal cells with expanding margins limited to alveolar septae (alveolar pattern).

Immunocytochemistry of specific Clara cell secretory protein expression in a transgenic mouse model of lung carcinomas developing from Clara cells has shown that the protein is lost during tumour cell progression.231 It has also been shown in strain A mice that the proportion of tumours with papillary and solid/alveolar growth patterns varies with the inducing agent.232 This also suggests biological differences exist between histological subtypes.",

Indeed, a considerable number of widely employed therapeutic agents of different classes have produced an increase in benign or malignant pulmonary tumours in carcinogenicity studies performed in mice without this proving of any significance to humans.

It was argued that the risk to human patients was slight because the increase in prevalence in pulmonary tumours was likely to be a result of changes in nutritional status of the mice through the effect of metronidazole on gut flora, as similar differences could occur between ad libitum fed mice and those fed the same but restricted diet.237 It was also postulated that the positive findings in bacterial mutagenesis assays were an inherent part of the antibacterial activity of metronidazole as a result of nitroreduction that does not occur in normal mammalian tissues. This conclusion was supported by negative effects in hamster carcinogenicity bioassays as well as lack of excess cancer risk in women followed up for 10 years or more.237\n",
