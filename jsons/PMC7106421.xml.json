            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious viral disease in China, Japan, and Korea. The SFTS virus (SFTSV) belongs to the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyavirus and was first identified by a group of Chinese medical researchers [1]. The major clinical signs and symptoms of SFTS are fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia. Multiple organ failure can sometimes occur, with a mortality rate of 6\u201330% [[1], [2], [3]]. A previous study that used a pathogenic mouse model of SFTS reported that the viral RNA was detected and enriched primarily in the spleen during the acute phase of the disease. The study also suggested that because the virus was attached to the surface of the platelet and was detected in the cytosol of macrophages, macrophages may phagocytose SFTSV-attached platelets [4]. In an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 knock-out mouse model, dendritic cells, megakaryocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells were not targeted by the virus; rather, reticular cells in the lymphoid tissues of the intestine and spleen were the major target cells [5]. In humans, however, the pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood due to insufficient data.",

G-CSF, IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, CXCL8, and IP-10 levels were higher in the SFTS group than in the healthy control group during the entire course of hospitalization (Supplementary Fig. 3). The levels of IFN-\u03b1, IL-10, and IP-10 increased during the early course of disease and decreased during the late course of disease (Fig. 2\n). By contrast, the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, RANTES, and VEGF in plasma tended to increase during the late course of disease (Fig. 2). We also analyzed the relationships between cytokine or chemokine levels and the viral RNA load. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, MCP-1, CXCL8, and IP-10 levels were found to significantly correlate with viral load (r > 0.6, P < .01), whereas RANTES and VEGF showed inverse correlations with viral load (r < \u22120.3, P < .01) (Fig. 3\n).

However, there are limited data on the detailed viral kinetics of patients with SFTS [10,11]. Yang et al. reported that viral load reached the maximum at day 6 from the onset of symptoms and then gradually decreased with a negative conversion of RT-PCR in about half of patients tested on day 18 after symptom onset [10]. Wen et al. demonstrated that 50% of the SFTS patients they reviewed were SFTSV positive according to RT-PCR within the first 2 weeks after symptom onset [11]. Our current data, which showed that the median time to negative conversion of the RT-PCR result for SFTSV from symptom onset was 26 days, are slightly different from those of previous studies [10,11]. A possible reason for this discrepancy may be methodological differences in the real-time RT-PCR. Another possible explanation could be a difference in the severity of the disease between the studies. Further studies on viral load kinetics that stratify the disease severity with minimal methodological variation are thus needed.",

In addition, the SFTS viral load had a positive correlation with the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, and CXCL8 and inverse relationships with RANTES and VEGF. Virus-infected cells release type I IFN, such as IFN-\u03b1, causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses. In addition, the fact that IFNAR-deficient mice are highly susceptible to SFTSV suggests the importance of IFN-\u03b1 in the resistance to SFTSV infection [5]. Our finding that IFN-\u03b1 was high during the early stage of SFTS is consistent with the findings of a previous study [12], which indicated that IFN-\u03b1 might be involved in a cytokine storm rather than being under the control of SFTSV. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and chemokines such as IP-10, CXCL8, and MCP-1 were elevated during the acute phase of SFTS, which supports the cytokine storm theory.",

However, IL-10 may play an important role in the amplification of humoral responses by inducing activated B cells to secrete large amounts of IgG, IgA, and IgM [14]. Previous studies on other viral hemorrhagic fevers have reported that IL-10 levels significantly increase in the acute phase of Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and dengue fever [[15], [16], [17]]. In addition, a previous study on SFTS demonstrated that IL-10 is increased in SFTS patients [12]. Therefore, this consistent finding of high IL-10 levels in the acute stages of viral hemorrhagic fever highlights the importance of the balance between IL-10-mediated T cell inhibition and B cell activation. Therefore, further studies are needed in this area.",

Because IL-13 and IL-17A are representative cytokines of the Th2 and Th17 subsets of CD4+ T cells, the chemokine profiles during disease course might contribute to shaping T cell immunity toward Th2 and Th17 responses. In addition, we found that VEGF was released from activated platelets and tumor cells that increased in the late stages of SFTS. Other studies on acute bunyavirus infection, Hantavirus, and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus have reported that the binding of VEGF to its receptor contributes to vascular hyper-permeability, resulting in effusions [18,19]. Interestingly, we also detected an increased RANTES level in the late stages of SFTS, reminiscent of a previous study in which we reported its marked elevation also in the late stage of survivors with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [20]. Previous studies have similarly reported increased concentrations of RANTES in survivors of Ebola viral disease [21]. Because RANTES can recruit and activate T cells, T cell activation may play an important role in recovery from Ebola, MERS, and SFTS.",

The levels of those cytokines and viral concentrations were most correlated at days 5\u201310 of admission. This correlation was maintained while the viral RNA was detected but disappeared as the virus became undetectable, which suggests that SFTSV infection induced the expression of these inflammatory cytokines. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing that concentrations of MCP-1, CXCL8, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 are correlated with the viral load of SFTSV [3,9,12]. However, the plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 in patients with SFTS were varied among the studies. In two such reports [6,7], the TNF-\u03b1 level of SFTS patients was higher than that in healthy controls and showed higher concentrations in severe cases compared with non-severe cases. On the other hand, some other studies have reported no significant differences in TNF-\u03b1 concentration between the plasma samples of severe and non-severe cases [12,22].
