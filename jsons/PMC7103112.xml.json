This capability to bind is attributed to the presence of seminal plasma proteins, which are attached to the sperm surface after ejaculation, leading to modulation of the acrosomal reaction by zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins [1]. Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) have been identified in several species, e.g. bovine [2], equine [3], [4] and swine [5]. In dogs, the high degree of affinity between arginine esterase from seminal plasma and an equine HBP (SSP-7) has been described [6]. The objective of this study was to separate the HBPs from canine seminal plasma using heparin affinity chromatography.",

The heparin-binding proteins were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography (\u00c4kta\u2122 Oligopilot, Amersham Biosciences) as described by Man\u00e1skov\u00e1 et al. [7] and modified as follows: the pooled seminal plasma (0.5 mL) was added to a heparin affinity chromatography column (16 mm \u00d7 26 mm, 1.0 mL/min) and equilibrated with PBS. Non-adsorbed proteins were washed out with PBS and bound proteins were eluded with 1 M NaCl. The data and graphics of the separated proteins in the chromatography were plotted by specialized software (UNICORN\u2122, Amersham Biosciences). The recovered heparin-binding protein fractions were pooled. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 12 and 18% were performed in vertical minigels (Mini VE\u00ae, Amersham Biosciences), as described by de Souza [8]. The gels were stained with silver nitrate, scanned (Image VDS, Amersham Biosciences) and molecular weight (kDa) values for each band within a lane were calculated with image analysis software (Image Master\u00ae, Amersham Biosciences).",

Thus, approximately 50% of canine seminal plasma bands bound heparin; and any of these could be involved in the acrosome reaction. Moreover, de Souza [8] also identified two bands (67 and 58.6 kDa) that were positively correlated to seminal parameters (e.g. sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal sperm and plasma membrane integrity). In the present study, a band with 61.5 kDa apparently corresponded to the 58.6 kDa band previously identified [8]. Earlier studies demonstrated a close relationship between HBPs and the acrosome reaction [1]. The present study identified this kind of proteins in canine seminal plasma. However, no relationship with fertility was determined. These proteins, especially the 61.5 kDa protein that is a HBP, could be involved in the canine acrosome reaction.",

Moreover, these proteins were correlated with fertility potential after cryopreservation, which dramatically decreased (70\u201380%) the HBPs of bovine seminal plasma [12]. Thus, HBPs have been indicated as a biochemical marker to predict the fertility potential of bulls [11], and a commercial test can be used to measure the presence of a protein on bovine sperm which corresponds to higher fertility (ReproduTest for Bulls, ReproTec Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA; www.reprotec.us). Whether the 61.5 kDa band is a biochemical marker for canine fertility or if it decreases following semen cryopreservation, remain to be determined.",

Characterization of seminal plasma proteins and studying their binding properties will be the first step in understanding their role in the fertilization process [20]. Since the HBPs were associated with fertility due to their modulatory role during the acrosomal reaction [1], their identification in the dog provides information that improves the understanding of physiological processes in this species. Moreover, the identification of such proteins in seminal plasma could provide better insight into the nature of subfertility or infertility in the dog, as well as enhance cryopreservation strategies. Further studies are needed to characterize these proteins and to elucidate their role in canine fertilization.",
