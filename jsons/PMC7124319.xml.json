A wide variety of cell surface receptors on immune system cells and other cell types have been postulated to transduce signals via the binding and activation of Syk [2], [3], [4], [5]. For the most part these include receptors bearing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) [2]. However, other non-ITAM-bearing receptors such as those for IL-2, IL-15, erythropoietin and lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin/LPS) have also been postulated to signal via the activation of Syk [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Syk is then believed to mediate the direct phosphorylation several proteins within an inflammatory complex including linker for activator of T cells (LAT), SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein-76 (SLP-76) and Vav [3]. Following the assembly and activation of this complex of proteins, activation of MAPKs, calcium-flux and PLC\u03b31 and PLC\u03b32 phosphorylation lead to degranulation, lipid mediator and cytokine synthesis. Syk has gathered a great deal of attention as a potentially novel target for the treatment of allergic and other inflammatory disorders [3], [10], [11]. In particular, several small-molecule inhibitors of the Syk kinase domain have shown efficacy both human and animal models of allergic disease [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].",

In this study, we designed a range of different Syk siRNA sequences and tested them for their ability to knockdown Syk in the rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cell line. Syk siRNAs were also tested for their specificity by investigating the induction of an interferon response, as analyzed by the expression of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats-1 (IFIT1/ISG56), which is a characteristic inflammatory response to viral dsRNA [20]. Selected siRNAs displaying a combination of efficient and specific knockdown of Syk were compared with the previously published Syk kinase inhibitors R406 [14], BAY61-3606 [15] and piceatannol [21] for their effect on Fc\u03b5RI signal transduction and basophilic degranulation. The identification of specific and cellularly active Syk sequences in this study provides a basis for the development of Syk siRNAs in more complex in vivo models of inflammatory diseases.",

In addition, the Syk substrates LAT (tyrosine 226) and SLP-76 (tyrosine 128) as well as the associated protein PLC\u03b31 (tyrosine 783) and downstream protein Erk (threonine 202/tyrosine 204) were also phosphorylated.

The phosphorylation of LAT, SLP-76, PLC\u03b31 and Erk was decreased by Syk siRNAs in a manner that directly correlated with their effects on Syk expression. Interestingly, whilst the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 100 and 70\u201375 kDa was reduced by Syk siRNAs, the phosphorylation of the 55 kDa protein was slightly enhanced.

The total levels of LAT, SLP-76, PLC\u03b31, Erk and \u03b2-actin were not affected by the Syk siRNAs indicating that the observed reduction in their respective phospho-forms was due to a decrease in their phosphorylation and not a decrease in their stability or expression.",

Meanwhile, recent reports have suggested that Syk may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of B and T cell lymphomas [33], [34]. Current approaches towards Syk inhibition include the use of small molecule kinase domain inhibitors and in particular the R406 compound has shown efficacy in animal and human models of RA [16], [32] and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [35].",

These approaches potentially enable the reduction of gene expression as a means of target modulation as an alternative to the action of small-molecule inhibitors for which there are only a limited number of \u2018druggable\u2019 targets. Aerolized Syk anti-sense oligonucleotides have been show to reduce Syk expression in alveolar macrophages and also blocked IgG/antigen-complex induced nitric oxide and TNF\u03b1 release, pulmonary infiltration of inflammatory cells and allergic contraction of the trachea [36], [37], [38]. These studies highlight the potential efficacy of targeting Syk expression levels as a novel therapeutic principle in airway inflammatory diseases.

Syk siRNAs A\u2013C and E\u2013J all knocked down Syk mRNA and protein expression and each tested siRNA was also able to block Fc\u03b5RI-induced signal transduction, degranulation and TNF\u03b1 release in a manner similar to the Syk inhibitors BAY61-3606 and R406. Interestingly, the commonly used and published Syk inhibitor piceatannol was shown to block RBL-2H3 cell degranulation and TNF\u03b1 release at concentrations which did not affect Syk-mediated signal transduction. This highlights the Syk-independent anti-inflammatory properties of this compound that must be considered in future studies. The blockage of Fc\u03b5RI signaling by each siRNA was directly proportional to their effect on Syk expression. These results not only suggest a fundamental role of Syk in Fc\u03b5RI signaling, but also demonstrate the efficacy of the siRNA approach in the targeting of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent allergic responses.",

            "text": "The clinical potential of siRNAs is somewhat limited by complications associated with activation of cellular anti-viral interferon-inducible genes and unanticipated off-target effects on other mRNAs. Syk siRNA A was a unique sequence in that it displayed the most potent knockdown of Syk expression and reduction of Fc\u03b5RI-activated signaling and cellular responses, coupled with a lack of effect on the cellular IFN response. Furthermore, Affymetrics analysis of the effect of Syk siRNA A on the global expression of rat mRNAs in RBL-2H3 cells revealed no off-target regulatory effects (data not shown). The identification of this sequence and its desirable in vitro profile, raises the possibility of this sequence becoming a candidate for progress into Syk-dependent diseases models in vivo. Other limiting factors for potential siRNA therapeutics include complications regarding the efficient delivery to specific target cells and the maintenance of siRNA in vivo stability. Airway delivery of siRNAs via inhalation has the advantage of potentially limiting systemic distribution of the molecules, whilst locally targeting airway cells and their genes [39], [40], [41]. Airway siRNAs have already demonstrated efficient local knockdown of targets including heme oxygenase-1 [42], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [43] as well as the blockage of the replication and pathogenicity influenza virus A [44], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [45], [46] and SARS coronavirus (SCV) [47]. Future studies are warranted to clarify the potential of inhaled Syk siRNAs in models of airway inflammatory cells in vivo.",
