            "text": "The advent of genomics technologies has revolutionized biological research. The complete genome sequence of a pathogen provides an abundance of opportunities to identify putative virulence factors through sequence analysis. These investigations are being aided by the development of new computational algorithms in this area. In the sections below, we discuss and outline the methods used in several investigations:\nSequence Similarity Search: Sequence similarity search is very popular and is among the first to be applied in sequence analysis. The goal here is to obtain orthologous sequences corresponding to a given query. This approach has been used to identify orthologues of known adhesins characterized in other pathogens (see\nNote\n1). The best known algorithm is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm [15]. Examples include application of BLAST algorithms in screening for potential adhesins in Mycoplasma agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma conjunctivae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Rickettsial species [16\u201321]. In addition BLAST can be used to identify orthologues of enzymes from pathogens involved in virulence: Hyaluronidase, Neuraminidase, Phospholipases, Proteases, Collagenase, Kinase, Coagulase, Leukocidins, Hemolysins.Sequence Motif search: Sequence motif refers to a particular arrangement or pattern of amino acids within a protein sequence, or nucleotides within a DNA sequence, which is characteristic of a specific biochemical function [22]. In particular, majority of protein sequence motifs, provide unique detectable sequence features for a set of protein sequences and thus act as signatures of protein families. Such motifs indicate similar functional roles.For example, in fungi, many Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified (GPI) proteins linked to plasma membrane via preformed GPI anchor play role in adhesion and virulence [23, 24]. These proteins have C-terminal GPI-motif described as follows: \u201c[GNSDAC]-[GASVIETKDLF]-[GASV]-X(4,19)-[FILMVAGPSTCYWN](10)>\u201d in Prosite format, where \u201c>\u201d indicates the C-terminal end of the protein [26]. Algorithm based on identifying sequences having a C-terminal, fungus-specific, consensus sequence for GPI modification (GPI-motif) helps screen a set of potential fungal adhesins [25]. Table 1 lists the motifs identified in several adhesins.\nSignal Peptide: Signal Peptide (SP) is a short stretch of sequence present in the N-terminus of the protein directing it to the secretory pathway [31]. Adhesins being membrane attached proteins usually posses N-terminal signal peptide for translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum [32, 33]. Therefore, algorithms using this information to screen for proteins having N-terminal signal peptide may help identifying potential adhesins (see\nNote\n2). However, there are adhesins called \u201canchorless adhesins,\u201d which do not have Signal peptide or Transmembrane domain. These \u201canchorless adhesins\u201d cannot be identified through these approaches.Transmembrane domain: Transmembrane domains are the regions of membrane proteins which traverse in and out, looping through the membrane. They are characteristics of integral membrane proteins. Since adhesins are mostly membrane proteins, the prediction of proteins having transmembrane domain would contribute to the set of putative adhesins (see\nNote\n3). However, this approach would lead to large number of false positives as not all proteins possessing transmembrane domains are adhesins.Domain Search: Domains are conserved autonomously folding functional unit of a protein [34]. The domains of a protein together define the function of the protein. The domain information of an unannotated protein sequence can be used to predict its function (see\nNote\n4).\n",

MAAP runs on complete proteomes of Plasmodium species revealed that in Plasmodium falciparum at Pmaap scores above 0.0, a sensitivity of 100 % was observed with two false positives. In P. vivax and P. yoelii an optimal threshold Pmaap score of 0.7 was found optimal with very few false positives (upto 5). The MAAP Web server provides users with an interface where they can paste or upload their query sequences and predict whether the protein sequence is an adhesin (see\nNote\n5).

The best classifiers were screened based on high MCC and accuracy. The amino acid composition model (ACHM), PSSM-a, and PSSM-b came out as the best classifiers with ACHM providing the highest MCC value of 0.610. Thus the prediction of Faapred uses classifiers based on compositional properties as well as PSSM. Faapred provides overall accuracy of 86 %.
