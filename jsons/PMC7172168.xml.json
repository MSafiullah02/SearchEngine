Indeed, less than a hundred cases have been reported [1], [2]. Moreover, Kawasaki disease usually evolves as an acute disorder, and has not been associated thus far with clinical or imaging features suggestive of spondylarthropathy. We report on an unusual case of a 40-year-old Caucasian male displaying severe Kawasaki-like symptoms. The disease lasted for seven years before diffuse coronary aneurysms occurred, leading to the patient's death, despite ongoing treatment by intravenous IVIGs. The patient had also been suffering from a disabling inflammation of the spine, which was reported to have started at the onset of the disorder. The clinical features of spinal inflammation were highly sensitive to IVIGs, and were attributed definitively to HLA-B27-negative axial spondylarthropathy after bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging disclosed typical enthesitis of both heels and bilateral sacroiliitis.",

Various conditions appeared: spiking fever, transient interstitial pneumonitis, transient proteinuria, severe synovitis of the knees and ankles, sensori-neural deafness and confusion (not explained by encephalic MRI and cerebrospinal fluid examination), together with a flare-up of features typical of Kawasaki disease, particularly an infected pharynx together with strawberry tongue, severe cheilitis (Fig. S1; see the supplementary material associated with this article online), cervical lymphadenopathy, and desquamation of the feet and hands which had started peri-ungually (Fig. S2).

The patient was then discharged. However, after two further infusions of IVIG, the patient reported another bout of inflammatory pain in the heels, sacroiliac areas and along the entire spine, associated with a polymorphous rash (without vasculitis on biopsy) and severe conjunctivitis. The CRP value was still very high (373 mg/l). A strong uptake of the radionuclide in the patient's heels and feet (Fig. 1\n) was evident on the bone scan, and an MRI scan confirmed enthesitis of the Achilles tendon insertion in both heels, as well as definite inflammation of the sacroiliac joints. Gastric and sigmoid endoscopies were unremarkable, with no features to suggest Whipple's disease. Indeed, macrophage infiltration, or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages were not observed in the intestinal mucosa.",

Angiography showed diffuse aneurysms in coronary arteries, one month before the patient's death. However, clinical features (including severe inflammatory back pain) relapsed one month after each immunoglobulin infusion, throughout the five-year period. This is an unusual phenomenon in Kawasaki disease, which is most often a short-lived disorder [1], [2]. Thus, this case should perhaps be classified as a Kawasaki-like disorder. Coronary aneurysms developed very late, as troponin levels, electrocardiograms, and thallium scintigraphy of the heart were still normal four months before the patient's death. Thus, the patient may have had a combination of a chronic Kawasaki-like disease and acute polyarteritis nodosa.",
