Proof of adequate health status from commercial suppliers employing sufficiently rigorous health surveillance programs in conjunction with appropriate exclusion housing often accomplishes the former. However, in cases where the health status of the incoming animals is not known or suspected to be inadequate, quarantine programs are necessary. To quarantine, by definition, is to detain and isolate on account of suspected contagion for purposes of assessment and management of such. Functionally, the goals of quarantine are to protect resident colonies from contagions, safeguard personnel from exposure to zoonoses, minimize the transmission of diseases between animals in quarantine, and optimize the health and condition of the newly acquired animals (Clark et al., 1995; Southers and Ford, 1995). Consequently, the facility used for the quarantine program must, by design and operation, meet these needs and also allow sufficient access by select personnel to obtain samples for health monitoring or perhaps limited, controlled access for research purposes.",

Although the facilities and rodent management programs employed at academic, pharmaceutical and governmental research enterprises are more advanced with regard to pathogen exclusion and disease prevention than in the past, they are still challenged by a wide variety of organisms (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998). For example, mouse hepatitis virus and murine parvoviruses may be found in colonies at more than one-third of academic institutions (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998). This has been exacerbated by the increase in genetically modified rodents, and the sharing of these animals among research institutions has been the genesis for high-level rodent quarantine facilities, equipment and containment practices (Hessler and Leary, 2002). Wild rodents and those from the pet trade that are sometimes used in research present an additional hazard of introducing zoonoses such as hantavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, leptospirosis and other diseases (Gregg, 1975; Donnelly and Quimby, 2002; Anonymous, 2003; Smith et al., 2005). The current incidence of diseases such as Pasteurella multocida in the overall population of rabbits available for research is unknown. In arrangements where reputable vendors supply rabbits meeting research health standards, such as freedom from pasteurellosis, quarantine may not generally be required. There may be a need to quarantine rabbits of unique and rare breeds, however \u2013 especially those acquired for research from farms, backyard production operations, auctions or the pet trade.",

Tuberculosis remains a disease risk with severe health and economic consequences; therefore, mycobacterial diseases still must be addressed and managed in non-human primates whether obtained from either foreign or domestic sources. Filovirus infections, particularly in imported non-human primates, are an additional risk (Clark et al., 1995). Epidemiologic surveillance suggests a 10 percent prevalence of detectable antibodies in wild-caught macaques and African Green monkeys, which suggests prior exposure and possibly infection with these agents (Anonymous, 1990).",

While these animals present a risk of zoonotic disease such as rabies, on a daily operative level, less severe infectious agents must also be managed in these species. For example, an epidemiologic assessment of infectious diseases in dogs (n=217) acquired from a municipal pound by Emory University in 1988\u20131989 demonstrated 35 percent of the animals developing clinical diseases in quarantine and a corresponding 9 percent total mortality rate (data not published). Of those dogs developing clinical disease, 60 percent suffered respiratory system disease (primarily infectious tracheobronchitis, ITB) and 40 percent unidentified mild diarrheal diseases typically responsive to time and anthelmintics. The mean prodromal period from the time of acquisition until the onset of clinical signs (\u00b11 standard deviation) was 14.7 days (\u00b111.5 days). Almost all mortality was due to euthanasia of animals with heartworm disease, vicious temperament, or clinical conditions unresponsive to treatment. The rate of spontaneous mortality was 1 percent. In the case of Class B dogs of dealer origin, the incidence of ITB in dogs purchased as \u201cconditioned\u201d was 11 percent, suggesting that additional stabilization and conditioning were necessary. Class B licensees acquire dogs and cats from other sources, including unclaimed animals from animal control institutions, and resell them to research institutions. Likewise, cats of unknown health status obtained from random sources frequently incubate or are actively infected with a variety of pathogens that may be difficult to diagnose, control or manage, including feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency disease and feline infectious peritonitis (Griffin and Baker, 2002).",

            "text": "The incubation (or prodromal) period of a disease, and its repercussions for quarantine design is important, as it helps determine how the space will be used to manage multiple shipments. If an incoming agent was enzootic at the source institution, detection may take only a few days with sufficiently broad testing. Bona fide quarantine periods generally last at least 3\u20134 weeks, however, because 2\u20134 weeks is the commonly accepted time period for micro-organisms to proliferate to levels detectable using serology, bacterial culture or molecular diagnostics (Rehg and Toth, 1998; Shek and Gaertner, 2002). Depending upon the agent, inoculum, host age, host genotype and other factors, the development of detectable serum antibodies may be variable, requiring longer quarantine periods \u2013 as has been shown in the case with mouse parvovirus (Besselsen et al., 2000). Although the tuberculosis dermal hypersensitivity reaction in macaques generally becomes apparent by 4 weeks following inoculation (Clarke, 1968; Schmidt, 1972; Janicki et al., 1973), it is noteworthy that almost half of all cases diagnosed in imported macaques occurred after the first month of quarantine (Anonymous, 1993). If some members of an animal population, particularly rodents, become infected at the time of shipment or receipt, or originated from a colony where they were housed in barrier cages, only a small percentage of animals may be infected (Thigpen et al., 1989; Lipman et al., 1993; Homberger and Thomann, 1994; Pullium et al., 2004). In these cases, infection may be difficult to detect, leading to the requirement for broad sampling of the population and/or repeated sampling conducted over a prolonged period of time. The risk of contamination during shipment has been observed at 1.5 percent for rodents shipped by air (Rehg and Toth, 1998). While this may seem low, the costs of management of an infectious disease outbreak can be exponentially greater if the pathogen is inadvertently released into the facility at large, rather than confined to quarantine (Rehg and Toth, 1998). Where many shipments may be received into quarantine, the facilities should be sufficiently spacious and compartmentalized to permit animals from one shipment to be effectively separated from animals from other shipments, in order to preclude transfer of infectious agents between groups.",

As swine emerge in importance as a source of tissues and organs for xenotransplantation, the need to maintain swine of \u201cxenograft-defined\u201d microbiological status under stringent exclusion and containment conditions will be paramount (Swindle, 1998; Boneva and Folks, 2004). Coxiella burnetii, the highly infectious causative agent of Q fever, is widespread in ruminants worldwide, with human infections reported in virtually every state in the United States (McQuiston et al., 2002). Quarantine programs have also been advocated for marsupials, reptiles, amphibians, domestic and wild-caught fish, and wild birds (Jurgelski et al., 1974; Wolff, 1996; Astrofsky et al., 2002; O\u2019Rourke and Shultz, 2002; O\u2019Rourke and Schumacher, 2002; Stoskopf, 2002).",

The ubiquitous mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), murine noroviruses (MNV) and continually emerging parvoviral infections of rodents involve transmission by many routes, including both airborne and feco-oral for MNV (Wobus et al., 2006) and MHV, and ingestion and close contact for parvoviruses such as murine parvovirus (MPV) (Smith et al., 1993). Coxiella burnetii can be excreted at high levels from sheep during parturition, and transmitted by aerosol to humans over long distances and in small quantities (Lyytikainen et al., 1997). Common respiratory diseases of dogs and cats, such as ITB and feline respiratory disease complex, are likewise transmitted by aerosol and direct contact. The threat, however, does not end with the animals themselves. Away from animals, a number of pathogens can persist in the environment and on contaminated fomites for days to weeks at a time or even longer, including agents such as parvoviruses, picornaviruses, dermatophytes, bacterial spores, nematode eggs and the like. The management and prevention of transmission by these routes and others, such as skin puncture and mucous membrane exposure from splashes, must be addressed in the design of facilities. A number of items used in quarantine can become contaminated and, if not properly handled or decontaminated, these items represent a risk for dissemination of contagions out of quarantine, into the facility and beyond. Transmission via fomites can be by either aerosol or non-airborne mechanisms. Consequently, the prevention of transmission of agents via inanimate objects exiting the area must also be considered in the design and operation of quarantine facilities. Potential fomites that may be encountered in the context of quarantine operations include clothing, sharps, soiled cages and bedding, used water bottles, shipping containers, other forms of solid waste, diagnostic specimens, scales, veterinary examination equipment, clippers and sanitation supplies.",

The approach to quarantine can be conveniently divided into that intended for species of foreign versus domestic origin. An additional division can be made along the discriminator of non-human primates versus all other species. Unlike most other species used in research, non-human primates often come from a wide variety of sources, have a poorly defined health status and harbor unknown flora, thus representing a significant zoonotic hazard (Southers and Ford, 1995).",

Consequently, quarantine programs for rodents, as run by different research institutions, are essentially large, grand experiments under a constant state of evaluation and adjustment. In considering quarantine design, attention should be given to the regularity of incoming shipments, the average batch size and mean total quarantine census, the housing method, and the duration of the isolation period. The space dedicated to quarantine should allow for cage-change stations and the safe conduct of diagnostic sample collection, and some flexibility to enable limited experimental procedures such as tissue collection or simple surgeries. At Emory University, where mice are received into quarantine on a weekly basis, batches are typically moderate in size (3\u2013 to 10\u2013cage range), barrier technology is used at the cage level, and the quarantine period lasts 8\u201312 weeks. Space for this activity is dedicated to accommodate 1\u20133 percent of the total institutional mouse-cage census or the equivalent of 2 percent of the total net square footage for mouse housing. Another approach is to use a ratio of the number of cages in quarantine per overall number of scientists at the institution using the given species; however, such benchmark data have not been developed. These methods might not apply to small institutions with a low rodent census and infrequent gift rodent exchanges, and likewise may not apply to large (>20,000-cage census) operations. It is important to appreciate that institutional rodent quarantine programs are expensive, often adding substantial levels of complexity and impediment to collaborative research (Grimm, 2006), and the ideal would be to facilitate gift rodent exchanges using embryo transfer or equivalent technology. As institutions with the financial wherewithal and in-house resources convert significantly to trading embryos or sperm or other biological materials rather than live mice, less space will be needed for rodent quarantine. Given that some mice are used for acute or short-term studies and that not all sources will have the wherewithal to bank and ship embryos, sperm or the like, it is not realistic to believe that all live mouse shipments will become obsolete.",

Quarantine periods of 8\u201312 weeks are recommended for random-source cats (Griffin and Baker, 2002). The aforementioned experience at Emory University with unconditioned dogs, particularly the considerable variation around the mean for the onset of clinical signs of disease, suggests that relatively lengthy quarantine periods (e.g., 24\u2013day minimum) are warranted and should be considered. While different institutions and programs would approach this situation in diverse ways, given that most dogs remained asymptomatic, the authors\u2019 approach was to relocate dogs stepwise through a series of three rooms dedicated to quarantine as they underwent preventive medical procedures. Through time, the animals were moved into rooms containing populations of progressively healthier dogs as they became increasingly stabilized over a 24\u2013 to 30\u2013day quarantine period. The management of newly received swine and small ruminants should be considered in the same light of quality of source, number of sources, anticipated use and the like as for dogs and cats.",

Although the concept of physical isolation is straightforward, the location and design of the physical space can influence the operation of quarantine programs on multiple levels. The ideal is to locate quarantine facilities completely separated from resident colonies in a stand-alone structure (Hessler et al., 1999; Bernacky et al., 2002). Where a separate building is not possible, quarantine should be located in space at the building periphery, near the receiving area (Ruys, 1991) but isolated within secure confines away from major foot traffic thoroughfares (Southers and Ford, 1995; Hessler et al., 1999) (Figure 26-1\n). Where quarantine is remote from the receiving area, animal delivery into quarantine should be through a corridor system designed with differential air pressures, preventing contamination of other areas of the facility (Southers and Ford, 1995). Quarantine operations are facilitated by a location within reasonable proximity of the cage-wash, autoclaves, necropsy and animal-carcass storage facilities.",

The design of the space should allow for flexibility in use and take into account the various species requiring isolation, the prospect of multiple acquisitions, the duration of quarantine periods by species, and the housing method. Quarantine facilities should allow for physical separation of animals by species to prevent interspecies disease transmission, and is usually accomplished by housing different species in separate rooms (Clark et al., 1995). Where intraspecies separation is essential, such as when rodents are obtained from multiple sites or sources and differ in pathogen status, suites of rooms or cubicles are preferred. Suitable alternatives are laminar-flow units, cages that have filtered air or separate ventilation, and isolators, particularly for rodents, providing the species are otherwise behaviorally compatible (Clark et al., 1995). Keeping in mind that not all institutions are blessed with perfectly designed quarantine areas, or the resources or even the scientific demand to dedicate one to full-time use, there are times when objectives must be accomplished within the scope of the resources available. In this case, the availability of programs and other infrastructure to compensate for inadequate space or design becomes the key determinant in the success of the program, and often depends upon staff making a challenging situation work through strict adherence to effective standard operating procedures. Given these considerations, there are three general options for quarantine layout: a single room, a suite of rooms or a suite of cubicles.",

Oftentimes a secured room with negative differential airflow relative to the corridor and otherwise meeting Guide construction specifications may be appropriate (Hessler et al., 1999). For example, for livestock, carnivores, rabbits and non-human primates, it may be appropriate to house a received batch in a standard animal housing room under quarantine standard operating procedures and to allow the room to revert to normal use once quarantine is completed without relocating the animals. In an agricultural setting, this concept might be as simple as locating barns, loafing sheds, paddocks and pastures for newly received animals physically separated from and downwind of more stabilized animals. An additional consideration, however, is that some airborne diseases, particularly Q fever (Lyytikainen et al., 1997), can be transmitted over great distances, and even from farm to farm.",

Optimal cubicle ventilation resulting in minimal turbulence, stagnation and entrainment has been found to be provided by delivering 20 air changes per hour via two opposed sidewall diffusers located low on the wall, and with exhaust high in the cubicle on the back wall (Curry et al., 1998). Cubicles are wasteful of space when the suite is devoted to only one species and do not promote efficiency of rodent operations when they contain large numbers of cages, as it is difficult to move racks, access biosafety cabinets and process large numbers of clean and soiled materials without extensively widening the central corridor. For the same reason, it is cumbersome to move racks to transfer non-human primates from soiled to clean cages in the often close confines of a cubicle suite. The control of airborne cross-contamination between cubicles can be compromised when doors are opened unless a cage-level form of containment is used. This risk can be obviated to some extent with meticulous adherence to sensible practices that prevent cross-contamination. These include keeping all the cubicle doors closed, opening only one door at a time, and minimizing the time any one door may be open (White et al., 1983). It bears noting the one infectious disease study validating the effectiveness of cubicles in pathogen containment was based upon Sendai virus (parainfluenza type 1) infection of rats (White et al., 1983). Compared to other agents, such as coronaviruses (e.g., MHV, SDAV), subsequent experience has shown Sendai virus to be of low transmissibility, except under conditions of close contact (Dillehay et al., 1990; Homberger and Thomann, 1994). The reliance upon Sendai virus may not have allowed a suitably rigorous assessment of cubicles as containment devices. In the case of rodents, cubicle systems should be shown to be effective in the containment of highly infectious agents (such as coronaviruses and pinworms) before being relied upon as the primary means of containment. Until then, the role of cubicles should be as a secondary containment component in support of cage-level barrier systems.",

Due to the high cost of construction or renovation of such spaces, the approach to design should be pragmatic (Ruys, 1991) and based upon legitimate risk. As pathogens may be transmitted by a variety of mechanisms, including aerosol, the physical design and operation of quarantine areas for animals of uncertain health status should ideally utilize as many of the design principles of animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) containment as possible (Hessler et al., 1999; Chosewood and Wilson, 2007). While the vast majority of animal pathogens pose no health threat to humans, many agents represent an airborne threat from one individual to another of the same species, and sometimes even other genera. A facility built to ABSL3 standards would consist of a sealed room or suite of rooms with air- and waste-handling facilities; facilities for the decontamination of personnel and for disinfection or sterilization of soiled implements and equipment; entry and egress through air locks; and back-up power. Where the ideal cannot be realized, the facility minimally should be designed to operate at animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) (Chosewood and Wilson, 2007). These facilities are especially effective when additional layers of protection are employed, such as when flexible film isolators or barrier-level caging systems are used within the facility.

One advantage of cubicle suites is that the corridor can serve as a nominal anteroom (Figure 26-4). Where an airlock exists, interlocking hardware should permit only one door to be opened at a time (Hessler et al., 1999). The anteroom should contain sufficient space to accommodate a hand-washing sink, trash receptacles, and an area to stage racks, cages, supplies and implements either entering or exiting the area. In the efficient management of rodents, the design should provide for enough space to permit the storage of a full complement of complete, intact cages. As an alternative, the anteroom should be sufficiently spacious to contain and allow the passage of a fully loaded rack of caging materials without interfering with the doors (Hessler et al., 1999). Assembling cages from separated components in quarantine should be avoided, as it theoretically risks contamination of clean cages and transmission of infectious agents.",

As such, the perimeter walls should extend to the floor above (Hessler et al., 1999). In extreme, high-risk cases, it may be useful to design a double-wall system utilizing an air lock and progressively differential air pressures (Ruys, 1991). Construction may need to be more substantial and damage-proof than the norm in the case where powerful animals, such as chimpanzees (Riddle et al., 1982) or livestock, may be quarantined. Construction features that enable vermin exclusion cannot be over-emphasized. Importantly, utility service access should be from outside the quarantine area, typically in the interstitial space above the external corridor, for facilities management and physical plant maintenance personnel (Hessler et al., 1999). For decontamination purposes, wall orifices should be provided for attachment of volatile hydrogen peroxide chambers or operation of fumigation equipment. Exhaust and supply ducts in the room(s), cubicle suite(s) and any anteroom(s) should be configured with dampers enabling the space to be sealed for fumigation. Sealing the anteroom enables the possibility to decontaminate large or complex pieces of equipment before removal into the uncontaminated corridor. Also useful may be a sleeve port for peracetic acid, chemical decontamination or pass-through dunk tanks (Hessler et al., 1999).",

In essence, air should flow in a gradient from areas of least risk into that of the greatest hazard (quarantine). This includes supply and exhaust ventilation down to the level of individual cubicles (Hessler et al., 1999). To ensure that the differential air pressure remains progressively negative and properly balanced with respect to anterooms, corridors and other adjacencies, circulation should be regularly monitored with alarmed sensors. As a redundant failsafe, differential air-flow monitoring devices should be installed for local, visual monitoring of proper air-flow direction by technicians and other personnel in the area. This can be done using magnehelic pressure gauges or balum devices (e.g., a ping pong ball in a tube), or by affixing inexpensive flexible plastic strips at the door ventilation grill. To prevent abnormal relative air pressures in the case of a fan failure and reduce the possibility of contaminated air reaching the clean areas of the animal facility, a mechanism should be in place to cut off supply air by closing dampers or turning off appropriate fans. Likewise, to avert retrograde flow of potentially contaminated air, supply-duct dampers should also close automatically when air supply is interrupted. Air turnover rates should range from 12 to 20 air changes per hour (ACH) for rooms (Kaufmann and Anderson, 1978; Hessler et al., 1999) and up to 35 ACH for cubicles (Hessler et al., 1999) in order to dilute and remove any micro-organisms suspended in the air in the quarantine environment. Design should allow for air-supply and exhaust ducts to be situated in light of computational flow dynamics, in order to promote the best air circulation for the space and to minimize unventilated \u201cdead\u201d pockets of air (Hessler et al., 1999). Air effluent from the quarantine area should not be recirculated, and air exhausted to the outdoors should not be discharged near air-intake ducts or elevator shafts. Finally, the principle of redundancy should be applied in the form of dual fan and filter systems along with emergency power supply.",

Wastes should be disposed of in a safe and sanitary manner that complies with federal, state and local codes and regulations. Feces, soiled contact bedding and liquid waste from quarantine ordinarily can be disposed via the sanitary sewer system or incineration, or disposal by a licensed contractor. If waste is deemed to be of high hazard, however, it should be collected and rendered safe by appropriate means prior to removal from the facility.

Regarding the former, feces and urine collect in pan beneath cage or on the floor under a suspended expanded metal grid floor, and are periodically rinsed manually or automatically into a common drain. Where detergents and/or disinfectants are added to water for spray-rinsing, chemical burns or intoxication are risks if done overzealously (Kelley and Hall, 2002). Likewise, the splashing of water during wet cleaning procedures has been determined to be a risk factor for the transmission of tuberculosis (Ford et al., 1973) and, potentially, other agents (Kelley and Hall, 2002) in non-human primates. A variation of the basic wet system is the wet vacuum system, where the excreta pan is filled with disinfectant at all times and periodically vacuumed, but this adds the potential risk of splashing or creation of aerosols. If wet sanitation systems are used and a grinder is not incorporated into the system, 6-inch diameter drains are necessary to accommodate the discharge of the waste, and hair and gas traps may be necessary. Likewise, all drains should have short runs to the main, or be steeply pitched (Manning et al., 1980). For these reasons, albeit largely theoretical and weakly empirical, some facilities are managed using the dry alternative. In this system, shavings, shredded corn cobs, plastic, treated paperboard or other equivalent materials are used to bed the excreta pan. The pans are removed and replaced with appropriate regularity, decontaminated if necessary, and dumped and washed in the cage-wash facility.",

Other types of personalized information that can be used to allow and document entry include fingerprints and retinal images. View ports in doors, two-way intercoms, dataport access, and phone jacks for fax and telephone should be considered. These reduce the level of traffic in and out, and the ability to transmit data electrically from within the quarantine area and into administrative or other areas eliminates the risk of taking contaminated hard copies into these areas. Installing doors with view ports enables persons in the corridor to check visually for personnel in the room without compromising biosecurity by opening a door.",

While there may also be a need to contain other wild-caught or large animal species, the increased use and exchange of genetically engineered mutant mice especially demands rodent quarantine capabilities for the majority of research institutions. Apart from species-specific housing requirements, it is important to consider pathogens to be contained in terms of the route of transmission and degree of hazard to human and animal health. Animals obtained from commercial vendors, as opposed to other research institutions, may be less likely to harbor undesirable micro-organisms, often allowing them to be exempt from a quarantine program.",
