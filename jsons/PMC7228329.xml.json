            "text": "Since December 2019, there has been an increasing number of unexplained cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in China's Hubei province, which has quickly spread to other cities as well as abroad. The Chinese Health Authorities have carried out very appropriate and prompt response measures: (a) The Chinese government has been dealing with the epidemic in strict accordance with notice no. 1 of the national health commission that pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus shall be included in the management of categories B infectious disease, and the prevention and control measures of groups A infectious disease shall be taken\n1\n; (b) The government decided to close down Wuhan, Hubei province, and launched a primary public health emergency response in several provinces and cities across the country. At the same time, the World Health Organization has recently declared the COVID\u201019 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).\n2\n On January 3, 2020, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan,\n3\n which is recognized as typical of a lineage B betacoronavirus. It has an envelope, the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, and the diameter is 60 to 140 nm. Its genetic characteristics are significantly different from SARS\u2010COV and MERS\u2010COV. The current research showed that it had more than 85% homology with bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (bat\u2010SL\u2010COVZC45). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours, while it took about 6 days in Vero E6 and Huh\u20107 cell lines,\n4\n and it has been identified as the cause of COVID\u201019. The study found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had the characteristics of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, and the R0 was estimated at 3.77,\n5\n which was significantly higher than the MERS\u2010COV. According to the official report, the virus may have the characteristics of aerosol transmission, that is, the potential for aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment exposed to high concentrations of aerosols for a long time.\n6\n The identification and control of suspected COCID\u201019 patients as early as possible were crucial to controlling the further spread of the epidemic by managing the source of infection and cutting off the transmission route. At present, there is however very limited clinical information of the COVID\u201019. Therefore, in our study, the clinical data of nearly 3 months from December 2019 to now were retrieved and collected in a large sample to discover and reveal the clinical symptoms, laboratory test data, and epidemiological characteristics of COVID\u201019 patients, so as to provide help for clinical and epidemic prevention and control of the disease. The data were analyzed by using Microsoft Excel and STATA 15.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, SE).",

As a result, the patient discharge rate is relatively low. Recently, it was reported that Remdesivir clinical effect is visible, clinical III trials are ongoing in the domestic, and survivors plasma treatment for heavy, severe cases has shown definite curative effect.\n6\n We should believe that these treatments will significantly reduce the mortality of such patients soon. Limited by the number and quality of included studies, more extensive and large\u2010scale studies are required to identify the clinical features of the disease.",
