Also, some studies have been conducted on the effects of this disease on humans [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At the same time, the treatment of the Coronavirus and the processes occurring after it have been examined by Zhang et. al. In the study, the possible conditions of the patient who was treated on Covid-19 disease and discharged were examined [2] . Covid-19 was examined in terms of dermatologists by Darlenski and Tsankov. They presented the effects of extreme hygiene measures on the skin and the factors that dermatologists will consider in this regard [20] . [26] provided automatic pneumonia diagnosis in infants through computer-aided systems from radiographic images. In this system, pneumonia data is classified using three classifiers. The classifiers used are Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor and Na\u00efve Bayes. In this study, it was determined that the most suitable classifier for the available data is Support Vector Machines. Pneumonia disease was identified and classified by chest x-ray images by Jaiswal et al. [27] . In this study, deep convolutional neural network method was used. The main purpose of using this method is to provide an effective acquisition of local and global features of chest X-ray images. In this study, NIH CXR14 [28] dataset was used. In the study, the evaluation parameter mean threshold value and mean score was selected. Liang and Zheng [29] have developed a smart system for child Pneumonia disease. The convolutional neural network method was used in the developed system and the performance of Kermany [30] dataset was used. In this study, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC were used as evaluation criteria. The accuracy value was calculated as 90.5% in the proposed method. Sirazitdinov et al. interpreted chest x-ray images with machine learning techniques. RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset [31] was used in the study.

The main objective of the ResExLBP is to extract meaningful features and IRF is proposed to select most discriminative features. The selected most discriminative features were classified by using 5 methods with LOOCV and 10-fold CV. The proposed ResExLBP and IRF based method achieved 99.69% and 100.0% classification accuracy by using SVM with LOOCV and 10-fold CV respectively. Robust classification results rates were calculated by using LOOCV and 10-fold CV. We also showed number of errors in Table   1 .",
