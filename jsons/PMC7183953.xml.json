There were also concerns that aspirin + clopidogrel would increase bleeding complications in patients undergoing urgent CEA.",

Prasad et al.3 based on a meta-analysis of three RCTs4 (CHANCE,5 POINT6 & FASTER7) in which 10,447 patients were randomised within 24 h of experiencing a minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS \u22643)5\u22127 or \u2018high-risk TIA\u2019 (defined as an ABCD2 score \u22654)5,6 to aspirin monotherapy or short-term aspirin + clopidogrel combination therapy, recommended in a BMJ Rapid Guidelines document that there was now compelling evidence to support short-term treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in these patient subgroups.3 This fundamental change in recommendation, towards more routine prescription of short-term DAPT in patients with TIA or minor stroke, assumes even greater relevance due to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is currently wreaking havoc on health systems around the world. Health Providers have had to radically reconfigure the way hospitals work, including converting some operating theatres into Intensive Care facilities. This, inevitably, will have a \u2018knock on\u2019 effect on the ability to perform elective and even urgent surgical interventions, including carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) has established a series of online surveys of vascular surgical practice around the world to gauge the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on workflow. Between 23rd March and 5th April 2020, 249 centres reported on the impact of the pandemic on carotid surgery practice. Just under half of the centres (42%) were still able to follow national/international guidelines and have not changed practice. However, 45% of centres indicated that they were now treating most recently symptomatic patients with TIA or minor stroke with \u2018best medical therapy\u2019 (after multidisciplinary team review), 12% said they would only offer CEA to patients with \u2018crescendo\u2019 symptoms, while 1% entered \u2018other strategy\u2019 (Thanos Saratzis; personal communication). It is, therefore, essential that these patients really do receive \u2018best medical therapy\u2019.",

In an overview of natural-history studies involving TIA patients with 50\u201399% ipsilateral stenosis, the 7-day risk of early recurrent stroke was 8\u201320%, with a 14-day risk of 11\u201325%.12 However, there is non-randomised evidence that early recurrent stroke might be prevented by early institution of DAPT, which would be consistent with the latest RCT findings. In a recent audit, there was a 48\u201372 h delay between patients being seen in the TIA clinic and undergoing CEA, during which time 13% experienced recurrent stroke/TIA. When a decision was made to start DAPT in the TIA clinic (once parenchymal haemorrhage was excluded on CT/MR), recurrent clinical events prior to CEA fell fivefold from 13% to 3%, in association with a fourfold reduction in rates of spontaneous embolisation from 21% to 5% on transcranial Doppler ultrasound.13 In addition, performing expedited CEA in patients on DAPT was not associated with a significantly increased risk of peri-operative bleeding complications overall.13\n",

            "text": "The main debate, therefore, relates to group 3 patients who present with a recently symptomatic 50\u201399% stenosis and who are awaiting expedited CEA (Fig. 1) and who are at a heightened risk of recurrent TIA/stroke pre-operatively. If the surgeon is happy to perform expedited CEA on aspirin + clopidogrel DAPT, parenchymal haemorrhage should first be excluded on CT/MRI and then the patient should be commenced on aspirin 300\u2013325 mg stat (if not already on aspirin), followed by aspirin 75\u201381 mg daily, in combination with clopidogrel 75 mg daily from day 1 (without a 300 mg loading dose). Expedited CEA, with very careful control of post-operative blood pressure should be performed, because uncontrolled post-CEA hypertension increases the risk of hyperperfusion syndrome, intracranial haemorrhage and neck haematoma formation.1 Aspirin can then be stopped on day 1 after CEA and clopidogrel 75 mg daily continued indefinitely, unless contraindicated.8 Whilst CHANCE, POINT and FASTER only included patients within 24 h of symptom onset, if one is certain that the surgeon will perform expedited CEA on aspirin and clopidogrel, it seems reasonable to start DAPT if patients present >24 h after TIA/minor stroke onset, especially within the first 10 days, when the risk of early recurrent stroke is highest. It is also important to prescribe gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors that do not interact with clopidogrel (e.g. pantoprazole) in patients prescribed DAPT, to reduce GI bleeding complications, as per ESVS guidelines.1\n",

Antiplatelet-HTPR is a potential risk factor for vascular events on antiplatelet therapy, but no studies (to date) have been adequately powered to definitively comment on whether ex vivo HTPR status predicts the risk of clinical outcome events in asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis patients in the peri-operative or non-peri-operative phase.16, 17, 18, 19 The prevalence of antiplatelet-HTPR is also positively influenced by the shear stress levels to which platelets are exposed in the ex vivo platelet function testing platform in question.19 Accordingly, further studies are required to determine whether one could optimise secondary prevention with the use of personalised antiplatelet regimens which are tailored to suit individual patients with carotid stenosis based on their antiplatelet-HTPR status.17, 18, 19\n",

There is now compelling RCT evidence that early institution of aspirin + clopidogrel significantly reduces early recurrent stroke after a high-risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke and that aspirin + clopidogrel DAPT only needs to be continued for 21 days. There is also increasing anecdotal evidence that a growing body of surgeons are now more willing to perform expedited CEA on aspirin + clopidogrel DAPT.
