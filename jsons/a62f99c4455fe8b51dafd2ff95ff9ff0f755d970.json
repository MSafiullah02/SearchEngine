Aberrant miRNA expression seems to play a central role in the pathology of several respiratory viruses, promoting development and progression of infection. miRNAs may thus serve as therapeutic and prognostic factors for respiratory viral infectious disease caused by a variety of agents. We present a comprehensive review of recent findings related to the role of miRNAs in different respiratory viral infections and discuss possible therapeutic opportunities aiming to attenuate the burden of viral infections. Our review supports the emerging concept that cellular and viral-encoded miRNAs might be broadly implicated in human respiratory viral infections, with either positive or negative effects on virus life cycle. Figure 1. Following viral infection, host cells alter their microRNAs (miRNAs) expression as a defense against infection, while viruses can circumvent host defense and promote their own propagation by affecting host cellular miRNAs expression or by expressing their own miRNAs 391 MicroRNAs and respiratory viral infection",

They are RNA-sequence-specific post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression [1] . miRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of organisms and originate in the nucleus as primary miRNA transcripts (~1000 nt), which are processed by the dsRNAspecific endonuclease Drosha into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA (~70 nt) are transported to the cytoplasm, and further processed by Dicer into mature miRNAs. A single strand of mature miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which binds to the three prime untranslated region (3 -UTR) of target mRNA, and exerts direct effects by blocking the translational process or inducing mRNA degradation, and indirect effects by influencing methylation or targeting of transcriptional factors [2, 3] . Over 2000 human miRNAs are currently recognized in the comprehensive miRNA database miRBase [4] , and the function of many of these miRNAs in various biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis is well established [1] . It is estimated that about 60% of human genes may be subjected to miRNA regulation. miRNA systems constitute complex combinatorial networks, where one miRNA may regulate many mRNA, and conversely, one mRNA may be regulated by several miRNAs [5] .",

The success of viruses principally depends on their capability to efficiently use the host machinery to take advantage of basic biological processes [16] [17] [18] . miRNA systems have several features that make them ideal tools for virus propagation. They are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators. They are both small and non-antigenic and can modulate expression of several critical cellular pathways [19] [20] [21] . miRNA systems modulate viral replication and pathogenesis in several ways: (i) Host cell miRNAs can positively or negatively affect viral replication and pathogenesis as a result of their biological functions. (ii) Some viruses also encode miRNAs. Current evidence indicates that viral-encoded miRNAs target several cellular genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, stress responses, and anti-viral response. (iii) Virus-encoded miRNAs may also regulate viral gene expression [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Thus, host-encoded miRNAs, virus-encoded miRNAs, and miRNA targets together form a novel regulatory system (miRNA system) between the host and the virus, which contributes to the outcome of infection [19, 28] .",

This can enhance virus replication, apparently by down-regulating specific cellular mRNA targets with anti-viral potential [31] [32] [33] . Alternatively, viruses may use the miRNA system to limit their own replication in infected cells, allowing evasion of the host immune response, survival of infected cells, establishment of viral latency, and increased spread to other individuals in a population [34] . Furthermore, other studies indicate that viral gene products inhibit cellular miRNA expression [35] . Thus, viruses can induce certain cellular miRNAs that affect the virus life cycle positively and inhibit those that affect the virus life cycle negatively [29] . Interestingly, some viruses can propagate despite the presence of host cell-encoded inhibitory miRNA. Viruses may avoid inhibition by cellular miRNAs by several methods including: (i) blocking cellular miRNA biogenesis; (ii) inhibiting cellular miRNA function; or (iii) evolving 3 -UTR sequences that miRNAs are unable to bind to because they are not complementary to miRNA, are too short, or have complex secondary structures that could restrict binding by RISCs [36] . However, some reports demonstrated that specific cellular miRNAs can negatively inhibit virus replication [37] [38] [39] .",

Recent studies show distinct miRNA expression profiles in ill patients with influenza A (H1N1), that is, down-regulation of miR-29a, miR-29c, let-7g, miR-146b-5p, miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-769-5p, miR-30b, miR-31, miR-361-3p, miR-362-3p, miR-342, miR-155, miR-210, and miR-192. These miRNAs are involved in the regulation of important biological pathways during virus infection, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and toll-like receptor signaling pathways [91] . Additional studies detected high expression of miR-299-5p and miR-335 in influenza patients [91, 92] . In contrast, miR-765, miR-34b, miR-519e, miR-18a, miR-628-3p, miR-185, miR-576-3p, miR-519d, miR-28-5p, miR-26a, miR-1285, miR-665, and miR-30a were down-regulated in H1N1 patients, and interestingly, miR-576-3p could affect viral entry into cells by regulating AP1G1 expression [60]. Furthermore, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-106a, and miR-376c were significantly elevated in H7N9 patients [93] .",

Influenza infection up-regulates miR-29 expression, which is involved in regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses through protection of A20 mRNA [32] . miR-29 acts as an RNA decoy to prevent HuR (human antigen R) from binding to the A20 3 -UTR and recruiting the RISC [94] . A20 is a deubiquitinating enzyme known to play an important role in terminating the anti-viral immune response by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factor pathways [95] . Influenza infection of A549 cells induces expression of miR-146a, also a negative regulator of NF-kB [51]. Interestingly, one study showed that the zoonotic respiratory hendra virus induces miR-146a, which promotes viral replication by targeting ring finger protein 11 [33] . In a study by Huang, et al., up-regulation of several miRNAs including miR-15b-3p, miR-24-2-5p, miR-331-3p, miR-124-3p, and miR-337-5p was demonstrated following H1N1 infection. These miRNAs participate in toll-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, and also regulate IL-1\u03b2 and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 [52]. Furthermore, miR-7, miR-132, miR-146a, miR-187, miR-200c, and miR-1275 accumulate in human lung cell lines in response to infection with two influenza A virus strains, A/Udorn/72 and A/WSN/33, causing down-regulation of anti-viral proteins such as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 [53].",

For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus induces miR-141 shortly after infection, which suppresses the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 in lung epithelial cells [58] . Without sufficient transforming growth factor-\u03b2, the proinflammatory response might not be tightly controlled in cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 infection [96] . The 1918 pandemic influenza virus induces a distinct miRNA expression profile in mice compared with non-lethal influenza A/Texas/36/91, including down-regulation of miR-200a and up-regulation of miR-223; miR-223 is a negative modulator of neutrophil activation, and miR-200a has a role in the type I IFN response [59]. miVARNAs expression Down-regulates the HDGF expression [71] miR-214 expression Inhibits virus replication [72] Apoptosis is characteristic of influenza virus infection, and the mechanisms underlying this have advanced understanding of influenza virus replication [49, 50] . According to Othumpangat, et al., in the first hours after influenza infection, down-regulation of miR-4276 increases cytochrome c oxidase VIC expression, inhibiting viral replication by inducing the apoptotic protein caspase-9. However, after 6 to 9 h, this effect is completely reversed, thereby prolonging cell survival. This may suggest that influenza virus is able to induce miR-4276 and inhibit cytochrome c oxidase VIC and caspase-9 expression, thus promoting viral replication [50] . Recent studies have revealed that miR-29 family members are up-regulated during influenza infection, especially miR-29c, which targets the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2like 2 contributing to virus-mediated apoptosis [49] . Furthermore, down-regulation of miR-30 family members and up-regulation of miR-223 during influenza infection lead to increased apoptosis [48] .",

Rhinoviruses cause respiratory infection in humans with severity ranging from the common cold to viral bronchiolitis, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [115] . Bondanese, et al. showed that cellular miRNAs miR-128 and miR-155 with putative sites in the rhinovirus-1B coding region can inhibit virus replication. miR-128 inhibition seemed to increase viral replication by inducing apoptosis. The detection of miR-155-mediated anti-viral activity in bronchial epithelial cells is very relevant because this miRNA has a central role in innate and adaptive immunity. As an example, miR-155 has been shown to target suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, an inhibitor of type I IFN signaling [38]. . Following RSV respiratory infection, an altered expression profile of certain cellular miRNAs, specifically immune-associated miRNAs, occurs in order to inhibit viral replication and preserve the airway epithelial barrier; meanwhile, the virus induces or inhibits the expression of other miRNAs that favor viral replication. The RSV G protein enhances let-7f, the RSV NS1/NS2 proteins decrease miR-30b and enhance let-7i, and RSV infection decrease miR-221, which is an advantage for the virus A minor group of rhinoviruses including subtypes 1A, 1B, 2, 23, 25, 29, 30, 31, 44, 47, 49, and 62 commonly utilize the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) for entry into host cells, and cause disease more often than the major group. Recent evidence published by Ouda, et al., showed that down-regulation of VLDLR by miR-23b is of significance for host defense against the minor group of rhinoviruses. miR-23b was induced by RIG-I-like receptor signaling resulting in suppression of respiratory infections caused by minor group viruses, specifically rhinovirus-1B through down-regulation of its receptor VLDLR [66] . In conclusion, these results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in human anti-viral responses against rhinovirus infection ( Figure 5 ).",

VARNAs are expressed at very high levels in adenovirus-infected cells and potently inhibit human pre-miRNA via inhibition of nuclear export of pre-miRNA, competition for exportin 5 to facilitate their transportation, and inhibition of Dicer activity by direct binding to Dicer [69, 123] . Adenovirus miVARNAs target cellular and viral genes that are important for the virus cell cycle. Hepatoma-derived growth factor inhibits adenovirus growth. However, the expression level of hepatomaderived growth factor significantly decreased in response to miVARNAs under replication-deficient conditions, and this suppression was also observed during the early phase of viral infection under replication-competent conditions [71] . Adenovirus miVARNAs also target cellular genes involved in cell growth, gene expression and DNA repair. The TIA-1 (cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein) is down-regulated at mRNA and protein levels in infected cells expressing functional miVARNAs and in transfected cells [70] .",

For example, HCMV uses several of its own encoded proteins to disrupt the MHC class I pathway [124] and the fine balance between a beneficial and a destructive immune response [82] , and uses several of its own encoded miRNAs to disrupt a variety of cellular pathways such as TLR2/IRAK1/NF-kB signaling [125] . This virus therefore induces a complex and diverse pathogenesis, and is an opportunistic pathogen causing lung infection in immunocompromised individuals [126] . Host cell miRNA expression levels may determine the cellular site of HCMV infection. As an example, host miR-200 family members target the HCMV protein UL112 resulting in repression of this viral protein, and cells permissive for lytic HCMV replication demonstrate low levels of these miRNAs [127] . However, HCMV can also selectively alter the expression of some cellular miRNAs to help its own replication [128] . For example, significant up-regulation of miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183 have been observed following infection [77] . A study by Fu, et al., indicated that expression of host miRNAs may be affected by latent HCMV; at least 49 miRNAs were differentially expressed; Figure 6 . Adenovirus encodes viral miRNAs (miVARNAs) that potently inhibit human pre-microRNA (miRNA) via inhibition the nuclear export of pre-miRNA, competition for the exportin 5, and inhibition of Dicer activity by direct binding of Dicer. The miVARNAs are able to target cellular and viral genes that are important for virus cell cycle. Adenovirus miVARNAs target cellular genes involved in cell proliferation, DNA repairing, and RNA regulation. However, cellular miRNAs may play a role in anti-adenovirus replication by regulating virus gene expression. 39 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated accordingly [76] . In addition, HCMV encodes its own miRNAs that target both viral and cellular genes in order to regulate viral replication, viral latency, cell survival, and anti-viral immunity (Figure 7) [79].",

It has been reported that HCMV miR-US25-1-5p was highly expressed during lytic and latent infections, and inhibited viral replication [83]; HCMV miR-US25-2 reduces viral replication by targeting the RNA helicase eIF4A1, which is a requisite for translation of viral mRNA [130] , and HCMV miR-US33 negatively influences virus replication, possibly by suppression of the HCMV gene US29 [84] or cellular syntaxin 3 expression [131]. Premature expression of HCMV miR-UL112-1 during infection resulted in a significant decrease in genomic viral DNA levels, suggesting a functional role for miR-UL112-1 in regulating the expression of genes involved in viral replication [85] . Finally, HCMV encodes latency-associated CMV-IL-10, a homologue for cellular IL-10 associated with latent infection. Latency-associated CMV-IL-10 has been shown to suppress miR-92a, resulting in up-regulation of its target CCL8. The mechanisms for both miR-92a suppression and how CCL8 up-regulation might Figure 7 . Human cytomegalovirus, a DNA virus, encodes its own microRNAs, and human cytomegalovirus microRNAs target both viral and cellular genes in order to; first regulation of viral replication, second regulation of viral latency infection, and third regulation of cellular anti-viral immunity.",

For example, HCMV-restricting cellular BclAF1 is downregulated late in infection by HCMV-encoded miR-UL112-1 to promote virus production [87]. Furthermore, multiple HCMV-encoded miRNAs coordinately regulate reorganization of the secretory pathways responsible for controlling cytokine secretion and facilitate formation of the viral assembly compartment for efficient infectious virus production. In this aspect, HCMV-encoded miRNAs such as miR-UL112-1, miR-US5-1, and miR-US5-2 target multiple components of the host secretory pathways, including VAMP3, RAB5C, RAB11A, SNAP23, and CDC42 [132] . Additionally, HCMV employs its miRNA repertoire to counter cellular apoptosis and autophagy, particularly the mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic genes MOAP1, PHAP, and ERN1 are identified as potential targets for miR-UL70-3p and miR-UL148D, respectively [133] . Finally, a viral intergenetic non-coding RNA element, composed of highly conserved sequences throughout HCMV clinical strains, selectively degrades the cellular miR-17 family members of the miR-17-92 cluster and accelerates virus production [134] .",

In addition, HHV-6 salivary gland replication and subsequent secretion in saliva is the epidemiologically proven source of transmission [88, 135] . As discussed previously, herpesvirus-derived miRNAs play considerable roles in modulating both cellular and viral gene expression, thereby facilitating a suitable environment for productive viral infection and/or latency. Like other human herpesviruses, HHV-6 encodes its own miRNAs, promoting efficient viral infection [116, 136] . An miRNA encoded by HHV-6A (miR-U86) targets the HHV-6A IE gene U86, thereby regulating lytic replication, as revealed by growth analyses of mutant viruses ( Figure 5 ) [116] . However, HHV-6B encodes at least four pre-miRNAs at two positions within the genome in an antisense orientation related to predicted HHV-6B-specific genes [136] . These data suggest that HHV-6, like other herpesviruses, encodes its own miRNAs, but the precise function of these miRNAs in HHV6B requires further investigation.",
