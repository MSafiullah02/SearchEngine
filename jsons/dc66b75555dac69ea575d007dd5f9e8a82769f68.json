In this case, Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 30 sinicus) are the most probable origin and pangolin (Manis 31 javanica) as an intermediate host (Li et al., 2020) . 32 The asymptomatic incubation period of the virus is estimated 33 to be between 2 and 12 days; however, up to 24 days incubation 34 period was reported in some studies (C.C. Lai et al., 2020) . The 35 most common symptoms of coronavirus disease are fever, tired-36 ness, dry cough and shortness of breath. More than 80% of cases 37 are mild and recover from the disease without needing special 38 treatment. However, around 15% of cases are categorised as 39 severely ill and the remaining 5% are categorised as critically 40 ill. In severe and critical cases, acute respiratory disease can lead 41 to pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death. 42 Although it is still early to determine the case fatality ratio 43 (CFR); today it is estimated to be over 4.5% (WHO, 2020b transmission is now believed to be mainly via saliva associated 52 respiratory droplets and contact transmission. However, fecal-53 oral transmission is possible as SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 54 the stool of patients (Holshue et al., 2020) . 55 Vertical transmission (from mothers to their new-borns) 56 however, is not yet confirmed (H. Chen et al., 2020) . More-57 over, aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also 58 plausible as the virus can remain viable and infectious in aero-59 sols for at least three hours and on surfaces for days (van 60 Doremalen et al., 2020) . Transmission from asymptomatic 61 COVID-19 carriers possibility was also reported (Bai et al., 62 2020; C.-C. Lai et al., 2020) . 63 To date, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 64 reaction (rRT-PCR) test is utilised for the qualitative detection 65 of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respira-66 tory specimens obtained through nasopharyngeal and/or 67 oropharyngeal swabs. Viral RNA has been also isolated from 68 the plasma of some patients (Huang et al., 2020) . . Moreover, salivary gland epithe-79 lial cells can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV and become 80 a major source of the virus in saliva (Liu et al., 2011) . Even 81 after patient recovery, recusancy during the convalescence per-82 iod was reported (D. Chen et al., 2020) . This is plausible since 83 the presence of some virus strains in saliva for as long as 84 29 days have been reported in the literature (Barzon et al., 85 2016; Zuanazzi et al., 2017) . 86 In addition to blood and salivary contamination, the 87 majority of routine rental treatments generate significant 88 amounts of droplets and aerosols. This is usually related to 89 the utilisation of devices and equipment such ultrasonic sca-90 lers, air-water syringes and air turbine handpieces. in China during the epidemic; demand for urgent dental treat-94 ment decreased by only 38% (Guo et al., 2020) .
