With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide and the likelihood of a \"second wave\" of infection it is imperative to better understand the impact RAAS inhibitor use in antihypertensive covid positive hospitalised patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of ACEi or ARB in patients admitted with COVID-19 was conducted. PubMed and Embase were searched and six studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that 18.3% of the patients admitted with COVID-19 were prescribed ACEi/ARBs (0.183, CI 0.129 to 0.238, p<0.001). The use of RAAS inhibitors did not show any association with 'critical' events (Pooled OR 0.833 CI 0.605 to 1.148, p=0.264) or death (Pooled OR 0.650, CI 0.356 to 1.187, p=0.161). In conclusion, our meta-analysis including 'critical' events and mortality data on patients prescribed ACEi/ARB and hospitalised with COVID-19, found no evidence to associate ACEi/ARB with death or adverse events.",

This leads to a sequelae of events 4 , notably acute lung injury and consequently, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 11 . Thus, the use of ACEi/ARB and deactivation of RAAS might be beneficial in preventing these sequence of events 4 . There are no clinical data currently on the effect of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 and it will be interesting to see the results of further studies looking at these antihypertensives in COVID-19 patients 12 .",
