            "text": "To examine the ability of ras to activate signal transduction pathways in the absence of lipid modi\u00aecations, fusion proteins were constructed that target ras WT or activated ras 61L to cellular membranes as integral membrane proteins, using the \u00aerst transmembrane domain of the E1 protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which contains a cis-Golgi targeting signal. Golgi-targeted derivatives of activated ras were completely inactive in transformation assays. However, when examined in focus formation assays, transformation of NIH3T3 cells were seen with derivatives of ras 61L containing a mutated E1 targeting sequence that results in plasma membrane localization. Removal of the lipid modi\u00aecation sites in and upstream of the CAAX motif did not abrogate the transforming activity of plasma membrane-localized ras 61L derivatives, indicating that these lipid modi\u00aecations are not essential for ras activity, as long as the protein is correctly localized to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the activity of integral membrane versions of ras 61L was strictly dependent on a minimum distance between the transmembrane domain anchor region and the coding sequence of ras. Derivatives with only a 3-amino acid linker were inactive, while linkers of either 11-or 22-amino acids were sucient to restore transforming activity. These results demonstrate that: (1) activated ras targeted to Golgi membranes is unable to cause transformation; (2) lipid modi\u00aecations at the C-terminus are not required for the transforming activity of plasma membrane-anchored ras 61L derivatives, and serve primarily a targeting function; (3) a transmembrane domain can eectively substitute for C-terminal modi\u00aecations that would normally target ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, indicating that ras 61L does not need to reversibly dissociate from the membrane as might be allowed by the normal lipidation; and (4) in order to function properly, there exists a critical distance that the ras protein must reside from the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Introduction ras proteins are critical modulators of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and dierentiation. p21ras is a member of a large family of small proteins that act as molecular`switches', cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state . ras is activated in response to a wide variety of stimuli, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Binding of PDGF to its receptors induces their dimerization and transphosphorylation, creating binding sites for eector molecules (reviewed in Hart et al., 1995) , some of which regulate or activate ras. Activation of ras by growth factors recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (Stokoe et al., 1994; Leevers et al., 1994) , leading to Raf-1 activation and subsequent initiation of the MAPK cascade. ras also has been shown to activate Rac and Rho proteins, which control signaling pathways that lead to cytoskeletal modi\u00aecations Khosravi-Far et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1995a,b) . Activation of this pathway has recently been shown to be crucial for full transformation by ras (Prendergast et al., 1995; Khosravi-Far et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1995a,b) . Thus, combined activation of the Rac/Rho and MAPK pathways may constitute the entire intracellular response necessary for transformation by activated ras.",

Processing of this region consists of farnesylation of the conserved Cys residue four amino acids from the C-terminus (Cys186 in H-ras and N-ras), cleavage of the last three amino acids of the protein, and carboxymethylation of the new C-terminal Cys Jackson et al., 1990; Casey et al., 1989; Gutierrez et al., 1989; Clarke et al., 1988; Lowy and Willumsen, 1986; Shih and Weeks, 1984; Willumsen et al., 1984; Sefton et al., 1982) . N-ras and Hras have cysteines N-terminal of the CAAX motif, which become palmitoylated after the CAAX processing (Buss and Sefton, 1986) . In the case of K-ras-4B, the C-terminus contains a polybasic domain in addition to the CAAX motif which contributes to plasma membrane localization (Hancock et al., 1990 (Hancock et al., , 1991 Jackson et al., 1994) . The palmitoylation reactions are reversible, allowing for potentially dynamic localization of ras proteins (Magee et al., 1987) .

In its wild-type form, this transmembrane domain is capable of targeting heterologous proteins to cis-Golgi membranes. When the point mutation Gln37?Ile is present, proteins are instead targeted to the plasma membrane. These fusions allow us to address the question of whether ras must be able to reversibly associate with the plasma membrane for biological function as assayed by transformation and GTPase activity. To examine whether C-terminal modi\u00aecations of ras are required for functions other than targeting, we created similar fusion proteins that contain mutations which abolish processing of the CAAX box. Results presented here demonstrate that ras 61L can transform \u00aebroblasts if targeted to the plasma membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane domain, yet is not active when localized to Golgi membranes. We also show that integral membrane versions of ras 61L require a minimum distance from the membrane in order to activate signal transduction pathways leading to transformation.",

            "text": "To examine the possibility that activated H-ras can transform if targeted to membranes by an N-terminal transmembrane anchor, a variety of fusion proteins were designed. As illustrated in the left side of Figure 1 , ras WT and ras 61L proteins are localized at the inner surface of the plasma membrane by means of lipid modi\u00aecations at the C-terminus. The right side of Figure 1 depicts the orientation and design of the transmembrane-anchored ras derivatives. For derivatives containing the E1 cis-Golgi targeting signal, the transmembrane domain anchors the fusion proteins at Golgi membranes as Type I integral membrane proteins, with the ras-derived portion of the protein still in the cytosol. These derivatives allowed us to examine whether ras could function if localized to any membranous environment, thereby assessing the importance of the interaction between ras and the plasma membrane. Fusion proteins were also designed with a mutated E1(QI) targeting signal and are expected to be transported to the plasma membrane, with the Nterminus outside the cell, and the ras portion of the proteins on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Figure 2 represents all of the fusion proteins designed for this study. The feasibility of targeting ras to the plasma membrane by the N-terminus was previously demonstrated in work by Buss et al. (1989) and Lacal et al. (1988) , which examined the eect of Nterminal myristylation on ras 61L activity. Buss et al. (1989) described a naturally-occurring myristylated derivative of ras, p29Gag-ras, containing a 59-amino linker region between the myristylated Gly and the ras coding sequence. Lacal and colleagues generated Nterminally anchored ras derivatives by attaching the 15amino acid myristylation signal from pp60c-src. Our derivatives dier in that ras is anchored permanently to membranes as an integral membrane protein. The myristylation targeting signal used in previous studies has the potential to allow reversible association of ras with the plasma membrane. This is an important distinction, which allows us to examine whether ras needs to be able to come o of the membrane in order to function. By exploiting the E1 localization signal, we were also able to target ras speci\u00aecally to dierent membranes in the cell. We were also able to examine in more detail the minimum distance from the membrane that ras requires for activity, by designing constructs with linker regions of either 3, 11 or 22 amino acids.",

It is of interest to note that mutations in the C-terminus of ras 61L that abolish the lipidation of the proteins do not aect the ability of activated ras to transform NIH3T3 cells. Indeed, the derivative with an intact C-terminus was consistently three-to four-fold less ecient at transformation than derivatives with mutated Ctermini (See Figure 2 ; also compare Figure 3E , F and G). This could re\u00afect conformational strains conferred on the protein due to anchoring both termini to the membrane. Plasma membrane-targeted derivatives containing 3-, 11-, or 22-amino acid linkers were also examined by immuno\u00afuorescence. As seen in Figure 4 , derivatives that were positive in transformation assays localize to the plasma membrane (F, G, H, and J), and exhibit staining patterns comparable to that of ras 61L (B). Also, derivatives with 3-amino acid linkers were still targeted to the plasma membrane (D), although unable to transform cells. Thus, derivatives of ras 61L targeted to the plasma membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane domain are able to cause transformation, provided that there is a\u00afexible linker region of sucient length between the transmembrane anchor and the N-terminus of ras. These results also clearly demonstrate that ras 61L does not require lipid modi\u00aecations in order to transform cells, and suggests that the C-terminal processing of ras proteins primarily functions in a membraneanchoring capacity.",

Small GTPbinding proteins related to ras are now known to function in a variety of capacities within the cell, such as mediating vesicular transport in the process of endocytosis, sorting and tracking through the secretory pathway, and regulating the structure of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Hall, 1994; Ferro-Novick and Novick, 1993; Pfeer, 1994; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993) . Some of these processes may require the regulatory GTP-binding proteins to be transiently or reversibly associated with lipid bilayers, and only lipid modi\u00aecations would allow this dynamic association to occur. Our results suggest, in the case of ras, that a reversible association with the plasma membrane is not required for activation of transforming signal transduction pathways, since integral membrane versions of ras 61L are transforming. It would be interesting to examine the eects of anchoring other small GTP-binding proteins more permanently to speci\u00aec membranes or compartments using targeting sequences such as the transmembrane domain from the E1 protein.",

The crystal structure of c-H-ras bound to GDP (residues 1 \u00b1 171) or GTP (residues 1 \u00b1 166) indicates that the extreme C-terminus forms an alpha-helical region that juts out from the globular catalytic region of ras (De Vos et al., 1988; Pai et al., 1989) , suggesting that the catalytic domain is well-removed from the membrane in normal ras proteins. One can imagine that the native C-terminus of ras constitutes a natural`linker' region, not unlike the arti\u00aecial linker regions incorporated into our ras fusion proteins. This would explain the failure of the short 3amino acid linker at the N-terminus to allow for a functional fusion protein, whereas linkers of 11-or 22amino acids, corresponding more closely in length to the C-terminus of normal ras, do result in a transforming ras 61L derivative.",

Proteins were separated by 15% SDS \u00b1 PAGE, and detected by autoradiography (exposure time=2 days) Lane 1: mock; Lane 2: ras 61L -CAAX; Lane 3: ras WT -SAAX; Lane 4: ras 61L -3S; Lane 5: E1-3-ras 61L -CAAX; Lane 6: E1-3-ras 61L -SAAX; Lane 7: E1(QI)-3-ras 61L -3S; Lane 8: E1-11-ras WT -CAAX; Lane 9: E1(QI)-11-ras 61L -SAAX; Lane 10: E1(QI)-11-ras 61L -3S; Lane 11: E1-22-ras 61L -SAAX; Lane 12: E1(QI)-22-ras WT -SAAX. Molecular weight standards in kD are indicated to the right of each gel. Arrows indicate position of GTPase activity of transmembrane-anchored ras derivatives. Fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb Ab-2 (Y13-238) from transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells, and subjected to an in vitro GTPase assay with a-[ 32 P]GTP. Samples were spotted on PEI-Cellulose plates and chromatographed in 0.75 M KH 2 PO 4 , pH 3.4. Locations of GTP and GDP are indicated at the left of the \u00aegure.",
