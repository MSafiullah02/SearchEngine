Although the underlying mechanism of the acute decrease of peripheral T cell subsets observed in patients with SARS during the acute stage remains unknown, this clinical characteristic can facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of SARS.",

Recent studies of cynomolgus monkeys inoculated with this new coronavirus have revealed symptoms and histopathological findings similar to those in humans with SARS [15] , providing further evidence that the coronavirus in question is the causative agent of SARS. In addition, the genetic characterizations of multiple strains that have been identified in various regions around the world seem to suggest that this novel coronavirus does not mutate as quickly as HIV or hepatitis C virus, raising optimism about the development of therapies and vaccines in the future.

Between March and April 2003, we enrolled 98 patients who were in the acute stage of SARS and 25 patients who had recovered from SARS, according to World Health Organization criteria (http://www.who .int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en), at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing. Patients were treated at the hospital under the guidelines of the ethical review committee. Patients who were merely suspected of having SARS or who were deemed to probably have SARS were not included in the study. Patients in the acute stage of SARS were defined as those in the first week of the illness; recovered patients were defined as those free from the illness after \u223c1 month of recovery. (Most patients with SARS take \u223c1 month to recover, with the resolution of all symptoms observed during the acute phase. Once recovered, patients regain a normal body temperature, experience no cough or chest pain, and have normal chest radiograph findings.) The average age (\u202b\u05e2\u202cSD) of the patients in the acute stage of SARS was , whereas that 40 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 16 of patients who had recovered from SARS was . All of 41 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 15 these individuals, it was confirmed, had come into close contact with people with SARS. The patients' temperatures were between 38\u040aC and 40\u040aC at the time of diagnosis. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had developed dry cough or light-white sputum, 36% had shortness of breath, and 62% had hypoxia. Chest radiographs demonstrated air-space consolidation, with unilateral involvement in 64% of patients and bilateral involvement in 29% of patients. Most of the patients had relatively normal liver and renal functions. In addition, all of the par- ticipating patients were antibody and antigen negative for HIV-1, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). None of the patients received any kind of treatment before blood samples were collected.",

The HIV-1-positive individuals selected for the study were asymptomatic and were not receiving any antiretroviral treatment. Their CD4 T cell counts were 1400 cells/mL of blood at the time of diagnosis. The acute status was determined by an incomplete or evolving pattern in serum antibody reaction against HIV-1 antigens (bioM\u00e9rieux and Genelabs), as described elsewhere [16, 17] . Acute CMV infections were identified using an indirect immunofluorescence assay that detected pp65 CMV matrix protein, and acute EBV infections were detected by anti-EBV IgM in serum using a commercial detection kit. Additional blood samples were obtained from 56 healthy individuals who were on the hospital staff or who were blood donors.",

In CMVand EBV-infected patients in particular, increases in absolute CD3 and CD8 T cell counts were more profound than those in HIV-1 infected patients (figure 1B) [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . For instance, the mean absolute CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in patients infected with EBV were 7923 and 6224 cells/mm 3 , respectively, which were 5-10-fold higher than those in healthy individuals and 13-23-fold higher than those in patients with SARS. The absolute CD4 T cell counts in patients with HIV-1, CMV, or EBV infection, however, decreased modestly during the acute phase of infection (data not shown).",

In this report, we describe a systematic, crosssectional study of the changes of peripheral lymphocyte subsets in patients with SARS and compare the changes with those in patients infected with HIV-1, CMV, or EBV. Our results demonstrate for the first time that there is rapid and generalized lymphopenia in patients with SARS during the acute phase of infection, which is in distinct contrast to the proliferative responses seen in HIV-1-, CMV-, or EBV-infected patients. In patients who recovered from the initial SARS illness, an equally rapid and dramatic restoration of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell; B cell; and NK cell counts was seen in the peripheral blood.",

            "text": "It is intriguing to see the human immune system respond in a drastically different manner to different viral infections. Whereas HIV-1, CMV, and EBV infections lead to proliferative lymphocyte responses, other viruses-including the SARS coronavirus, the measles virus [25] , avian influenza virus H5N1 [26] , swine foot-and-mouth disease virus [27] , and respiratory syncytial virus [28] -are associated with generalized lymphopenia. It is believed that in measles infection, the acute lymphopenia is likely due to the apoptosis of uninfected cells [25] , whereas in H5N1, swine foot-and-mouth disease virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infection, the underlying mechanism is much less clear [26] [27] [28] . Currently, we know little about how the SARS coronavirus precipitates such severe lymphopenia in such a short period of time. It is possible that tissue sequestration, cell destruction in peripheral blood, or bone marrow failure singly or together play a critical role. However, given the rapid restoration of lymphocytes in peripheral blood in recovered patients, it seems that tissue sequestration may play the most important role determining lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in patients with SARS. The exact mechanism of lymphocyte sequestration, however, remains unclear. We can only speculate, on the basis of the clinical syndrome of patients with SARS, that lymphocyte infiltration and sequestration are likely occurring in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or lymphoid tissues. The matter of finding concrete evidence that would support this hypothesis, and indeed of gaining an understanding of the underlying mechanism behind SARS virus-induced lung and gastrointestinal sequelae, awaits resolution in future studies.",
