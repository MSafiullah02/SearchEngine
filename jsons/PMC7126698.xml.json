SARS CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus featuring the largest viral RNA genome known to date.4, 5 The genomic RNA produces two large proteins with overlapping sequences, polyproteins 1a (\u223c450 kDa) and 1ab (\u223c750 kDa), which are auto-catalytically cleaved by two or three viral proteases to yield functional polypeptides.6 The key enzyme in this processing is a 33-kDa protease called 3C-like protease (3CL protease), because its substrate specificity is similar to that of the picornavirus 3C protease.7, 8 The SARS 3CL protease is a cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin fold, and cleaves precursor proteins at as many as 11 conserved sites involving a conserved Gln at the P1 position and a small amino acid (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P1\u2019 position with varying efficiency.9, 10 The 3CL protease exists as a homodimer and each 33-kDa protomer has its own active site containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Fig. 1\nA). Interactions between the C-terminal domain-III of each protomer play an important role in the formation of this dimer. The N-terminal end of one protomer is also expected to interact with the domain-II of another protomer to fold the dimeric structure. Although some studies reported that the addition of several residues to the C-terminus of mature 3CL protease did not significantly affect its activity, the kinetic properties and specificity of the mature protease have not been well described.",

Few studies regarding reversible inhibitors containing an aldehyde group as a functional group have been reported.22 In the course of our own studies on the SARS 3CL protease and its inhibitors, we found that the mature protease could be further processed into two fragments devoid of catalytic activity. Here, we report on high level of expression in Escherichia coli and the purification of a proteolysis-resistant mutant of the SARS 3CL protease. The kinetic characterization of this mutant revealed remarkable potency compared with the mature 3CL protease containing a C-terminal His-tag. The potency makes it possible to evaluate newly synthesized peptide-aldehyde inhibitors quantitatively by conventional HPLC.",

The corresponding plasmid was introduced into E. coli, and the desired fusion protein of 75-kDa was obtained as a major product of the total cell lysate (Fig. 2\nA, lane 1). The fusion protein was easily purified with a cobalt affinity column to give a single major band on SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The 75-kDa product did not cleave SO1, an undecapeptide substrate (H-Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-NH2) containing the P1/P2 cleavage site of 3CL protease, probably because of an N-terminal fused large protein. After digestion of the fusion protein with enterokinase, the N-terminal 42-kDa fragment containing the MBP was detected, but the desired 33-kDa protein corresponding to the mature 3CL protease was hardly detected (Fig. 2A, lane 3). To confirm whether the 33-kDa protein was produced or not, we then added enterokinase in the presence of a protease substrate; the substrate SO1 was mixed with the fusion protein prior to the addition of the enterokinase. In this reaction mixture, the substrate completely disappeared within 1 h, and expected fragment peptides were clearly identified by MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 2B; peak 1, [M+H]+ 593.365 (Calcd. 593.353) for H-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-NH2; peak 2, [M+H]+ 618.288 (Calcd. 618.347) for H-Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-OH). This result suggests that the mature 3CL protease was temporarily produced by the digestion of the 75-kDa fusion protein by the enterokinase.",

After purification with a cobalt column, a small amount of 34-kDa product was detected by Coomassie staining and Western blotting using anti-His-tag antibody (Fig. 2C, lane 2, Fig. 2D, lane 1). The immunostaining, however, decreased in intensity gradually and a 14-kDa protein emerged after placement at room temperature (Fig. 2D, lane 2), or overnight incubation with enterokinase (Fig. 2D, lane 3).

Two additional bands at 20- and 13-kDa were also detected (Fig. 3, lane 2) as probable products of the proteolysis. The faint band of 33-kDa disappeared with prolonged treatment over 60 min (Fig. 3, lanes 3\u20134). The newly emerged 13-kDa protein seemed to be the same product obtained from the C-terminal His-tagged 3CL protease (Fig. 2D, lanes 2\u20133). By blotting the 13-kDa protein to a polyvinylidene difluoride(PVDF), the N-terminal sequence of the product was determined to be Gln-Thr-Ala-Gln-Ala, which shows that mature 3CL protease is cleaved at the 188Arg/189Gln site.",

Similar to wild-type 3CL protease, 3CL-R188I protease was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein, MBP-His-tag-R188I mutant. The 75-kDa fusion protein was obtained as a major product, and easily purified with metal affinity resin (Fig. 4\nA, lanes 1 and 2).

The 3CL-R188I protease was further purified by anion exchange chromatography at pH 5.5: the R188I protease with a calculated pI of 6.24 flowed through and the MBP-His6-Flag of pI 5.08 was absorbed on the resin as expected (Fig 4A, lanes 4 and 5). About 0.10 mg of the purified untagged protein was obtained from 100 ml of bacterial culture. A 34-kDa protein corresponding to 3CL-R188I with the C-terminal His tag was also directly produced as a major product (Fig. 4B, lane 1).

Thus, we examined the cleavage of mature 3CL protease by the mutant. Incubation of the C-terminal His-tagged mature 3CL protease with the purified 3CL-R188I protease gave the degradation product derived from the 3CL protease (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

These spectral data strongly suggest that the reduction with lithium aluminum hydride did not proceed as expected.
