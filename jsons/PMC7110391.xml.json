            "text": "Induction of robust and long\u2010lasting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses by a vaccine is an open and difficult challenge. In particular, protective immunity to viral infections is mediated by neutralizing antibodies and by CD8+ CTLs. Both responses depend on antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T helper lymphocytes. It was originally proposed that peptides recognized by CD8+ CTLs result from the processing of endogenous intracellular proteins and that peptides recognized by CD4+ T helper cells derive from exogenous antigens. More recently, it has been shown that peptides derived from exogenous antigens can also be provided to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules for presentation to CD8+ CTLs. This \u2018cross\u2010presentation\u2019 process involves both dendritic cells and macrophages such as antigen\u2010presenting cells, priming a wide variety of CD8+ T cell responses to different exogenous antigens (2002, 2004, 2004). We have developed an antigen delivery system based on filamentous bacteriophage virions engineered to display foreign epitopes. Fd phages (1994, 1996, 1997, 1996a, 1994) can display multiple copies of exogenous peptides inserted in the exposed N\u2010terminal region of the 2700 copies of the major coat protein, pVIII, that form the capsid of virion. We have demonstrated that fd phages could be processed both by MHC class I and class II pathways to induce CTL and T helper responses (Gaubin et al., 2003). In fact, double hybrid virions were used simultaneously displaying a CTL and a T helper epitope of the HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase (RTAse) to prime specific CTL from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and to perform in vivo immunization of HLA\u2010A2 transgenic mice (1999, 2000).",

We used the filamentous bacteriophage as a carrier of H2\u2010Kb\u2010restricted Ovalbumin257\u2013264 CTL epitope (SIINFEKL) and I\u2010Ab\u2010restricted hepatitis B virus core antigen128\u2013140 T helper epitope (TPPAYRPPNAPIL). The immunogenicity of the mix of two single hybrid phages, one carrying the CTL epitope and the other the T helper epitope, was compared with the double hybrid phage, displaying both epitopes on the surface of the same virion. The two different phage combinations were tested in C57BL6/J mice using either CFA/IFA or polyI:C as adjuvant. We found that the efficiency of the two antigen formulations on CTL activation is different. It is noteworthy that the single hybrid phage displaying CTL epitope is able to induce an efficient and long\u2010lasting response even in the absence of the T helper exogenous epitope.",

            "text": "In the search for new vaccines to replace older, ineffective or toxigenic formulations, peptides that are the target epitope of T and B cells represent attractive candidates. Peptides are usually poor immunogens and induce minimal CD8+ T cell responses, a shortcoming that may be overcome by coupling them to various carrier molecules. Moreover, vaccine formulations based on soluble exogenous antigens have been shown to be inefficient for class I presentation. To find the best strategy to deliver exogenous antigens into the MHC class I pathway and induce potent MHC class I\u2010restricted CTL responses, a broad panel of soluble and particulate vectors has been engineered (Moron et al., 2004) to take advantage of the capacity of antigen\u2010presenting cell cross\u2010presentation. Filamentous bacteriophage was used as a carrier of foreign peptides because it is an excellent antigen delivery system, a nonpathogenic and nonreplicating vehicle. It is simpler to handle and less expensive than other carriers (Guardiola et al., 2001). In previous papers we have demonstrated that antigenic peptides displayed on the phage capside are very immunogenic because these particles may be processed by class I and class II pathways (Gaubin et al., 2003). Other authors have also confirmed the mechanism of cross\u2010presentation of phage particles that are initially degraded in the proteasome. Subsequently, the resulting peptides may be delivered back into the phagosome lumen and loaded onto MHC class I molecules with help from the TAP complex (Wan et al., 2005). A very peculiar characteristic of bacteriophages is their ability to display multiple copies of exogenous peptides on the capside. The viral assembly allows the incorporation of 10\u201330% recombinant pVIII in the capside structure during the single or double hybrid phages synthesis, depending on the biochemical characteristics of peptides (di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994). For this reason the concentration of specific peptides administered with carrier is very low (1\u20134 \u03bcg) and the peptides have to be established by N\u2010terminal sequence for each phage preparation.",

Both phage formulations, the double hybrid phages fdOVA/HBVc displaying CTL and T helper epitopes on the same capside structure, and the mix of the two single hybrid phages fdOVA and fdHBVc, are able to induce peptide specific cytotoxicity and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production. Our results were confirmed by antigen\u2010specific tetramer staining. Although both phage formulations displayed 1.4 \u03bcg OVA peptide, the mix of single hybrid phages induced a higher CTL activity and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, probably because of the greater number of carrier phages used with a possible adjuvant role.",

The establishment of a long\u2010lived population of memory CD8 cells that can persist for the life of the immunized individual, and which can rapidly proliferate and assume effector functions upon re\u2010exposure to antigen (secondary response), has very important implications for the design of successful vaccines (Williams et al., 2006).",
