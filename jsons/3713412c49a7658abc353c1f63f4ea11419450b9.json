During this time, many people back their hometown for celebrating Spring Festival, and the virus quickly spread from Wuhan to other parts of China with the flow of people. On January 29, 31 provinces in the Chinese mainland launched the first level response mechanism for public health events (the highest). In order to prevent the further spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government decided to begin strict controls on entering and leaving Wuhan from January 23, and since then personnel have rarely continued to flow from Wuhan. As of two incubation cycles since Wuhan was sealed on January 23, that is, Figure 1 shows that there is a significant positive correlation between GDP and confirmed cases in different regions of an epidemic area. According to this finding, the epidemic prevention and control in different economic development areas in one region can be graded. In areas with high economic development level, the epidemic risk is high, and the more active and strict epidemic prevention measures should be taken. Such as: call on the public to reduce the flow as much as possible; do a well in personal protection.",

Therefore, during the epidemic period, we should minimize the flow, reduce the aggregation and prevent the virus from spreading among people. In particular, personal protection is very important to prevent infection, according to China's experience. However, some agencies recommend that healthy people do not wear face masks. But in fact, the role of face masks is mainly to block the virus, not treat the disease. Wearing a mask can prevent outside viruses from entering healthy people. It can also be seen from China's practical experience that wearing face masks has a significant effect on reducing the spread of the virus among people.",
