In this last case, G-CSF allows closer spacing of chemotherapy courses, thereby substantially improving the prognosis.14, 15 Although G-CSF is generally safe and well tolerated, there have been several reports of acute respiratory failure during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery.16, 17 G-CSF is believed to enhance cytokine production and to activate the oxidative burst within circulating or resident alveolar neutrophils and macrophages.11, 18 Because early diagnosis and treatment are key determinants of survival in cancer patients with acute respiratory failure related to neutropenia recovery, a careful and close clinical monitoring of respiratory symptoms (respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) must be proposed in this condition. To help clinicians bear in mind the increased risk of acute respiratory failure during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery in cancer patients, we describe 20 cases seen in our intensive care unit (ICU) over a 22-month period.",

The organisms were Aspergillus fumigatus (n=4), Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pneumocystis carinii, and respiratory syncytial virus. In all, 3 patients had pre-existing heart disease, but in none of them was the acute respiratory failure ascribable to cardiac pulmonary edema. Radiographic changes were present in all patients at acute respiratory failure onset and consisted in alveolar infiltrates in 13 patients, interstitial pneumonia in two, mixed alveolar and interstitial changes in three, and nodules in two. In 10 patients, hypoxia was considered too severe to allow bronchoscopy and BAL. Of the 10 patients who did undergo these investigations, five had tests showing a pathogen; alveolar cells consisted only in alveolar macrophages.",

First, we only report cases of critically ill patients with acute lung injury or ARDS during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery, but we do not report the magnitude of the risk. A prospective observation of the incidence and risk factors for respiratory symptoms (whatever the severity) during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery is timely. Second, further study should also seek to evaluate biological markers reflecting epithelial and endothelial injury that characterizes the disease, so as to help clinicians easily diagnose ARDS during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery. Third, G-CSF has been investigated in large randomized trials in cancer and noncancer patients without any report of pulmonary toxicity. However, these studies were not powered for detecting such pulmonary complications. Moreover, we believe that noncancer patients receiving G-CSF are not expecting to present with pulmonary toxicity since they do not receive cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, without neutropenia recovery, nor chemotherapy-related repeated endothelial injuries, the clinical condition we describe should not occur. Last, we did not demonstrate that G-CSF withdrawal resulted in respiratory improvement. However, G-CSF discontinuation is in order after neutropenia recovery, and since G-CSF-related pulmonary toxicity has been reported, all nonmandatory drugs potentially harmful for the lung should be stopped in case of severe respiratory failure.",

In the present study, the 25% mortality rate was far lower than expected in a population of critically ill cancer patients with severe disease, and a high rate of mechanical ventilation. This encouraging survival rate may be related mainly to early G-CSF discontinuation (at acute respiratory failure onset), early diagnosis, and effective early supportive care. This study, together with previous data from animals and humans, strongly suggests the harmful effect of G-CSF in some cancer patients who experience pulmonary infection during neutropenia. G-CSF is widely used in cancer patients and has substantially improved the safety of cancer chemotherapy and the prognosis of many malignancies. This agent is generally safe. Nevertheless, it may exacerbate respiratory disorders related to chemotherapy-associated pulmonary toxicity. The exacerbation occurs during neutropenia recovery. Physicians should be aware of this risk and should exercise great caution when using G-CSF in neutropenic patients with pulmonary involvement.",
