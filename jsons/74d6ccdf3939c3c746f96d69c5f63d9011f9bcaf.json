However, providers do not always follow CPW, and our understanding of their perceptions is limited. Our objective was to examine pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physician perspectives of CPW. Methods: We conducted semistructured, in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with PHM and PEM physicians between February 2017 and August 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and accuracy verified. Using an inductive analytic strategy, we systematically coded the data to identify themes. Results: We interviewed 15 PHM and 15 PEM physicians. These providers identified many benefits and limitations of CPW, which positively or negatively impact resource utilization, communication, education of personnel, patients, and families, as well as practice behaviors and attitudes. Perceived benefits included (1) reduction of unnecessary utilization, (2) standardization of care, (3) improved communication, (4) education of oneself and others, and (5) confidence and validation when actions align with CPW. Limitations of CPW were (1) resource utilization for revisions, updates, and dissemination; (2) \"tunnel vision\" and cognitive biases; (3) loss of autonomy; (4) prescriptive medicine; (5) information overload; (6) pressure to adhere; and (7) guilt if actions do not align with CPW. Conclusions: CPW are tools with advantages and disadvantages that are used and viewed differently by providers. Such insight into how physicians perceive CPW may help to optimize hospital improvement work and enhance high-value care.",

[2] [3] [4] CPW are one means to tackle this economic problem as they guide evidence-based medicine in more than 80% of hospitals in the United States as of 2003. 5 The need to practice high-value care, particularly by intervening at the provider level and understanding their perspectives, experiences, and practice behaviors regarding CPW, is critical. CPW are tools that standardize care processes and improve outcomes without increasing the cost or compromising quality. 1 In 2012, a Cochrane systematic review of CPW revealed that CPW decrease hospital complications and improve documentation without increasing length of stay or cost. 1 In 1 study, the use of a pathway for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis resulted in improved documentation of severity indices. The residents found this pathway to be user-friendly, informative, and a tool that positively impacted management. 6 However, literature exploring other providers' views of CPW for different disease processes or CPW, in general, is limited. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated specifically pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) or pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians' perceptions of CPW.",
