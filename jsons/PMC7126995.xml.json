Human disease is endemic and highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Clinical manifestations range from cutaneous ulcers to a potentially fatal visceral disease. L. donovani and L. infantum cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Africa, India, and Europe, and L. chagasi causes VL in Latin America. Dogs are natural hosts and the main reservoir of the parasite (Moreno and Alvar, 2002). These animals represent an appropriate model for the study of leishmaniasis, as the prevalence of canine disease is very high and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is similar to the human disease in several aspects (Nieto et al., 1999). Less than 50% of infected dogs present with signs of severe disease (Berrahal et al., 1996, Lanotte et al., 1979).",

Dogs experimentally infected with intradermal inoculation of promastigotes develop asymptomatic infections, and PBMC from these dogs stimulated in vitro with soluble leishmanial antigens (SLA) express both Th1 cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-18 and Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10. Despite the fact that PBMC from these asymptomatic dogs present such apparently mixed Th1 and Th2 responses, they predominantly display IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 production. In accordance with a previous observation (Pinelli et al., 1994), these data support the protective immune response observed in these animals (Chamizo et al., 2005). On the other hand, dogs experimentally infected with intravenously inoculated amastigotes develop progressive symptomatic infections. PBMC from these dogs produce reduced levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10) in the active phase of the disease (Santos-Gomes et al., 2002). Finally, PBMC from dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi display enhancement of IFN-\u03b3 expression, which is positively correlated with the humoral but not with the cell immune response to SLA. These results were observed without an increase in mRNA expression for IL-4, IL-10, and IL-18, although a small proportion of these animals display PBMC IL-4 expression related to disease severity (Quinnell et al., 2001).",

The analysis of the innate response of na\u00efve dogs to Leishmania may contribute to the current understanding of the early cellular events triggered by the parasite infection. The use of this in vitro assay, which may be capable of predicting canine response to L. chagasi or L. chagasi antigen stimulation, would be helpful for vaccine design and development (Holzmuller et al., 2005). In addition, the PIV system will facilitate extensive in vivo tests that are used to evaluate the efficacy of a dog vaccine candidate (Gradoni, 2001). The present work aimed to establish a PIV system that can discriminate between protective and non-protective immune responses. We detected that IFN-\u03b3 mRNA is up-regulated in these cells compared to control unstimulated cells. IL-4 and IL-10 expression by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was similar to that by control unstimulated PBMC. Correlation studies showed that both higher IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 expressions correlated with lower parasite infection.",

PBMC were obtained from heparinized peripheral blood, were layered over Ficoll\u2013Paque gradient (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then resuspended at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 106\n cells/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco BRL, New York, USA), 20 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N0-2-ethanesulphonic acid), 100 UI/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 g/l sodium bicarbonate, and 10% FBS (Gibco BRL) (RPMI complete medium). PBMC were stimulated with one stationary-phase L. chagasi promastigote per PBMC for 6 days. Half of the PBMC culture medium was replaced by fresh RPMI complete medium every day during 6 days of L. chagasi stimulation to avoid loss of cell viability (Berger, 1979). In parallel, autologous PBMC from the same five donors were cultivated in 24-well plates containing 12 mm-glass coverslips for 5 days to obtain peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, as previously described (Rodrigues et al., 2007). Five days later, macrophage cultures were infected with 10-stationary-phase L. chagasi promastigotes per macrophage (10:1 ratio) and used as APCs in the co-cultures as described next. Twenty-four hours after infection, non-adherent cells from the parallel cultures (L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC) were recovered and adjusted to a concentration of 2 \u00d7 106\n cells/ml, added to the 24-h infected macrophages, and then cultivated in RPMI complete medium supplemented with 20% of PBMC supernatant. Co-cultures were maintained for additional 2 and 4 days without replacement of the culture medium. At the end of the incubation period, only non-adherent PBMC were harvested and centrifuged for 15 min at 300 \u00d7 \ng, and supernatants were collected and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until tested for cytokine content by ELISA as previously described (Caldas et al., 2005, Rodrigues et al., 2007) and for the concentration of nitrite (NO2\n\u2212) by the Griess reaction (Green et al., 1982). In PIV stimulation assays, cytokine release in cell supernatant is very low. Therefore, PBMC co-cultured for 4 days were harvested for RNA extraction in order to determine cytokine expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Hein et al., 2001). Cytokine expression was determined in PBMC extract of four out of five dog donors. After 2 and 4 days of co-culture, adherent macrophages grown in quadruplicate were fixed with 100% methanol and stained by hematoxilin and eosin (H&E) for microscopic observations. Control PBMC from each dog donor were cultivated in RPMI complete medium in the presence of ConA (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 48 h (positive control) or in RPMI medium alone (negative control) during the 6 days of the stimulation period. In all experiments, PBMC harvested at the end of the first and second courses of stimulation presented 98\u201399% viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion.",

In response to either ConA or L. chagasi stimulation, cultures at 8 \u00d7 106\n cells/ml displayed a significant reduction in cell viability after 4\u20136 days in culture, despite periodical reposition of medium. For in vitro priming, PBMC from non-exposed dogs were cultivated at 5 \u00d7 106\n cells/ml and were stimulated with one L. chagasi stationary-phase promastigote per cell for a period of 6 days. Cell viability was maintained at 99% as determined by trypan blue exclusion when half of the culture medium was replaced every day during the 6 days of primarily PBMC stimulation. Once the ideal conditions for the PBMC cultures were established, co-culture assays were performed. After 2 and 4 days of co-culture, the parasite load was quantified to determine the effect of PBMC stimulation on macrophage infection. In order to further characterize the nature of the PIV immune response of PBMC from these na\u00efve dogs to L. chagasi, cytokine expression levels were determined after a second contact of these PBMC with the infected APCs. In a similar assay using human PBMC and macrophages, the in vitro system was capable of discriminating differences in immune responses from several non-exposed individuals to Leishmania (Pompeu et al., 2001).",

We hypothesized herein that the macrophage response to L. chagasi co-cultivated with PBMC that had been subjected to primary stimulation in vitro would be a useful test to predict the immune responses of non-exposed dogs to Leishmania promastigotes or antigens. Hence, PBMC from the five na\u00efve dogs that had been stimulated by L. chagasi were assessed for their ability to stimulate autologous macrophages to kill L. chagasi. In the present report, at 2 days of infection the parasite load in macrophages co-incubated with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (133.4 \u00b1 11.8) was 2.3 times higher in comparison to that in cells incubated with unstimulated PBMC (58.3 \u00b1 9.1) (Fig. 1A, one-way ANOVA, p\n < 0.01). This effect seems to be specific since ConA supernatant effect on parasite load (95.0 \u00b1 14.2) was not statistically different from the effect of control unstimulated PBMC supernatant in infected co-cultured macrophages (58.3 \u00b1 9.1). Finally, the enhancement in macrophage infection induced by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was reversed at 4 days of infection. Fig. 1B shows that, at this time point, macrophage response to infection did not differ among groups. It is possible that stimulated PBMC co-cultivated with infected macrophages produced cytokines that could control parasite infection by an effect dependent on cytokine accumulation in the cell culture supernatant.",

Evidence supports the notion that IFN-\u03b3 is one of the Th1 prototype cytokines responsible for activating macrophages, leading to an efficient killing of the parasites (Murray, 1982, Murray and Nathan, 1999, Holzmuller et al., 2005). Here, we observed that IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression levels by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC co-incubated with infected cells (median = 6.49; 95% CI = 5.08\u20138.19) (Fig. 2A) are higher compared to the expression levels of unstimulated PBMC co-incubated with infected macrophages (median = 4.10; 95% CI = 1.17\u20137.29) (Friedman, p\n = 0.0417). This indicates that the enhancement of IFN-\u03b3 expression is a specific L. chagasi-dependent mechanism. Independent of previous stimulation by L. chagasi, PBMC contact with infected macrophages induced higher IFN-\u03b3 expression than control unstimulated PBMC co-incubated with uninfected macrophages, in which expression was very low (\u22120.15; 2.17, n\n = 2). Correlation analyses between IFN-\u03b3 expression and the percentage of infected cells have been performed. As expected, IFN-\u03b3 expression positively correlated with reduction in the percentage of infected macrophages when they were co-incubated with either unstimulated PBMC (p\n = 0.0088, r\n2\n = 0.42) or L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (p\n = 0.0161, r\n2\n = 0.3699). These data show that the exposure of PBMC from na\u00efve dogs to L. chagasi antigens leads to IFN-\u03b3 expression levels that are related to the reduction of parasite infection in vitro.",

Previously, we have not detected differences in IL-4 expression by PBMC from immunized dogs, whether they were stimulated with L. chagasi\nin vitro or not (Rodrigues et al., 2007). Similarly, we observed herein that, upon L. chagasi stimulation, PBMC expressed similar levels of IL-4 mRNA (median = 5.78; 95% CI = 0.53\u20138.86) compared to unstimulated PBMC (median = 4.38; 95% CI = 1.25\u20137.17) (Fig. 2B). However, we have observed that IL-4 expression was higher when compared to the expression by the control unstimulated PBMC co-incubated with uninfected macrophages (0.68; 2.61, n\n = 2). In this PIV system, IL-4 seems to collaborate with IFN-\u03b3 in the control of parasite infection in vitro, since higher IL-4 expression positively correlates with control of parasite infection by macrophages co-incubated with either unstimulated PBMC (r\n2\n = 0.7973, p\n < 0.0001) or L. chagasi-stimulated cells (r\n2\n = 0.7167, p\n < 0.0001). This idea is also supported by the observation that a lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio correlates with a lower percentage of infected cells when co-incubated with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (r\n2\n = 0.5997, p\n = 0.0007). It is plausible to propose that this direct correlation between the IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio and parasite load is dependent on the higher correlation of both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 expression with lower parasite infection. Several years ago, it was clearly demonstrated that IL-4 in the presence of low concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 provides a strong stimulus for the killing of intracellular L. major (Bogdan et al., 1991). The synergism of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 is apparently based on the ability of these lymphokines to induce the endogenous production of TNF-\u03b1 (Stenger et al., 1991). Recently, it has been demonstrated that extremely susceptible golden hamsters once immunized with a kinetoplastid membrane protein-11-encoding construct were protected in both pentavalent antimony responsive and antimony resistant virulent-L. donovani challenges. These animals were protected by a surge in IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 levels, along with extreme down-regulation of IL-10. Expression of IL-4 was found to have a positive correlation to protection (Basu et al., 2005).",

The role IL-10 plays in CVL still is not very well defined (Lage et al., 2007, Santos-Gomes et al., 2002, Quinnell et al., 2001). Here, we observed that IL-10 mRNA from L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC (median = 2.14; 95% CI = \u22121.69\u20138.00) was similarly expressed in unstimulated PBMC (median = 3.71; 95% CI = \u22121.72\u20139.18) (Fig. 2C) either co-incubated with infected macrophages. This was similar to the IL-10 mRNA expression by un-stimulated PBMC co-incubated with uninfected macrophages (3.71; 4.10). Interestingly, the co-incubation of infected macrophages with L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC neutralized the positive correlation of IL-10 expression with a decrease in infection that we observed in unstimulated PBMC that had been co-incubated with infected macrophages. These data indicate that IL-10 seems not to participate in PIV stimulation of dog splenocytes. Similar to our work, no correlation with disease progression and IL-10 expression was observed in bone marrow cells from naturally infected dogs (Quinnell et al., 2001) or PBMC from experimentally infected dogs (Santos-Gomes et al., 2002).",

Briefly, when we co-cultivated L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC with infected macrophages, we found that IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was up-regulated in these cells, compared to control unstimulated cells. IL-4 and IL-10 expression by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was similar to control unstimulated PBMC. Both higher IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 expressions by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC and a lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 expression ratio correlated with reduction in the percentage of infection. Since this system allows the identification of canine primary immune responses, it could potentially be used as a screening test for the in vitro prediction of animal responses to vaccination or parasite infection.",
