More than 8000 cases of SARS had been identified worldwide, and nearly 800 patients had died before the epidemic ended [1]. The etiologic agent of SARS has turned out to be a novel coronavirus termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2], [3], [4], which is a plus-stranded RNA virus with an approximately 30-kb long genome encoding replicase gene products and the structural proteins containing spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Until now, the viral genome has been sequenced [5] and the viral receptor has been identified [6]. However, the pathogenesis of SARS remains poorly understood, and the apparent latency of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs continuously provides us a serious threat of reemergence. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against SARS.",

Accordingly, S protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies [7]. High titers of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected in sera of the recovered patients [8], and further, humoral immunity induced by a DNA vaccine contributed to the protection against SARS-CoV challenge in mice [7]. These data imply that neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in the clearance of SARS-CoV. On the other hand, a rapid loss of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in patients suffering from severe SARS, and the cell counts gradually returned to normal ranges as the patients recovered [9]. Furthermore, certain HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility [10], [11]. These data strongly suggest that, as with many other viral infections, virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be important for viral elimination in SARS as well.",

First, synthetic peptides rarely cause undesirable responses including general toxicity, immunosuppression and autoimmunity. Second, it is possible to select short peptides in the absence of amino acid mutations. Third, synthetic peptides can easily be prepared as a pure immunogen in large quantities. However, a major disadvantage is the weak immunogenicity. Therefore, it is critical to search for adjuvant vehicles which are non-immunogenic themselves but which enhance the immunogenicity of peptides.",

In most cases, it has been prepared by antigen entrapment within the aqueous lumen of liposomes. In contrast, we have previously shown that ovalbulim (OVA) chemically conjugated on the surface of liposomes induced OVA-specific IgG production but not OVA-specific IgE production in mice [13], suggesting that the surface-linked liposomal antigen could offer a safe antigen delivery system without allergic side effects. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that an OVA-derived peptide, OVA257\u2013264 conjugated on the surface of liposomes made from unsaturated, but not saturated fatty acid, induced OVA257\u2013264-specific CTLs in mice more effectively than did liposomes containing OVA257\u2013264 inside [14], [15]. In addition, it was shown that surface-linked liposomal peptides were able to provide tumor eradication [15] and protection against viral challenge [14] in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that liposomes would become an excellent adjuvant vehicle for a synthetic peptide vaccine when a peptide(s) is chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes.",

N protein was chosen for the analyses because this is more conserved than S protein.

Two weeks after immunization, spleen cells of the mice were harvested and stimulated in vitro with each of the peptides. One week later, 51Cr-release assays were performed at various effector:target (E:T) ratios. In agreement with the data of ICS (Fig. 2), the four peptides, N-222 (Fig. 3C), N-223 (Fig. 3D), N-227 (Fig. 3E) and N-317 (Fig. 3F) elicited strong peptide-specific CTL responses in Ad-SARS-N8E-infected mice but not in Ad-WT-infected mice. On the other hand, the remaining peptides, N-113 (Fig. 3A), N-159 (Fig. 3B), N-331 (Fig. 3G), and N-352 (Fig. 3H) failed to induce CTL activities in either Ad-SARS-N8E-injected mice or Ad-WT-injected mice. To further address peptide-specific killing activities in mice, in vivo CTL assays were carried out (Fig. 4\n). After immunization with either Ad-WT or Ad-SARS-N8E, HHD mice received i.v. injection of peptide-pulsed CFSEhigh targets and unpulsed CFSElow targets. Twelve hours later, spleen cells were prepared and peptide-specific lysis was assessed by flow cytometry. As was expected, N-222-, N-223-, N-227- and N-317-specific CTL killing activities were significantly detected in mice immunized with Ad-SARS-N8E, but not in Ad-WT-injected mice (Fig. 4). Especially, the activity of N-223-specific killing was greatest (Fig. 4), suggesting that N-223 might be an immunodominant epitope. Any of the remaining peptides, N-113, N-159, N-331 and N-352 could not induce peptide-specific killing activities in in vivo CTL assays (data not shown).",

Since four peptides including N-222, N-223, N-227 and N-317 were expected to be HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4), these peptides were chemically conjugated on the surface of liposomes. Surface-linked liposomal peptides, Lip-N222, Lip-N223, Lip-N227 and Lip-N317 were then evaluated for their capabilities of CTL induction in HHD mice. One week after immunization with each of the liposomal peptides, spleen cells were prepared, stimulated with a relevant peptide, and stained for their expression of surface CD8 and intracellular IFN-\u03b3. As shown in Fig. 5\n, significant numbers of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells were elicited in mice that had been immunized once with either Lip-N223 or Lip-N227 in the footpad. In the case of Lip-N317, however, one injection with Lip-N317 did not result in the induction of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5), and after three injections, a significant expansion of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in response to N-317 was finally observed (Fig. 5), indicating that Lip-N317 might be less immunogenic than Lip-N223 and Lip-N227. On the other hand, Lip-N222 failed to elicit N-222-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in mice (Fig. 5) even after multiple injections. Since N-222 is a 10-mer peptide composed of an N-223 peptide with one additional leucine at the N-terminus (Table 1), there was a possibility of cross reaction between N-222 and N-223. As shown in Fig. 6\n, both N-222 and N-223 peptides obviously stimulated IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in mice immunized with Lip-N223, demonstrating that N-223-specific CTLs primed by Lip-N223 was activated by stimulation with N-222 as well as N-223. In contrast, either N-222 or N-223 could not induce IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells in mice primed with Lip-N222.",

One week after immunization of mice, both peptide-pulsed CFSEhigh target cells and unpulsed CFSElow target cells were delivered into the mice via i.v. injection.

Therefore, we next tested whether mice immunized with Lip-N223 were able to clear virus challenged. HHD mice were immunized twice with Lip-N223 at a 2-week interval. Two weeks after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with 1 \u00d7 106\n PFU of VV-SARS-N8E or VV-WT. After 5 days following the challenge, viral titers were measured in two ovaries of each mouse. As shown in Fig. 8\n, titers of vaccinia virus in mice challenged with VV-SARS-N8E were 3 logs lower than those in mice challenged with VV-WT. Mice immunized with empty liposomes retained high viral titers after challenge with either VV-SARS-N8E (Fig. 8) or VV-WT (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that immunization with Lip-N223 is effective in the protection against virus.",

In fact, four CTL epitopes derived from S protein have been identified [31], [32], [33].

            "text": "High-performing computational algorithms have extensively been used for the identification of CTL epitopes [18], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Chentoufi et al. [34] supported their predictive computational algorithms by multiple immunological screenings. Thus, it is important to use multiple screenings for successful identification of functional CTL epitopes. We also performed multiple immunological screens, including cell surface stabilization of HLA-A*0201 molecules on T2 cells, detection of antigen-driven IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells, and functional in vivo and in vitro CTL assays. Our strategy for the identification of CTL epitopes has several advantages. First, the use of recombinant adenovirus and vaccinia virus allowed us to circumvent the necessity for handling live SARS-CoV. Both of the recombinant viruses, Ad-SARS-N8E and VV-SARS-N8E, carry the multiepitope minigene that encodes eight predicted epitopes with several natural flanking amino acid residues at both of the ends, thereby offering natural antigen processing in the infected cells. The basic idea comes from the observation that flanking sequences proximal to CTL epitopes modulate proteasomal processing of the epitopes [35], [36]. Furthermore, we can carry out in vitro and in vivo experiments using these viruses in BSL-2 facilities. Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus effectively induces CTLs specific for a protein encoded by a gene inserted into the viral genome [29], [37], [38]. Recombinant vaccinia virus can be employed as a virus challenged in the protection experiment [29], [39]. Second, we used highly reactive HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice, termed HHD mice [20]. Because the innate H-2Db and mouse \u03b22m genes have been disrupted by homologous recombination in HHD mice, the only MHC class I molecule on the cell surface, HLA-A*0201, is efficiently utilized by HLA- A*0201-restricted CTLs. We used lymphocytes of HHD mice infected with Ad-SARS-N8E as a replacement for PBL of SARS patients. As a consequence, we identified three HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes, N-223, N-227, and N-317, derived from SARS-CoV-N, which were identical to those reported by Tsao et al. [40]. This indicates that our approach has proved to be practical in the epitope identification for viruses. However, it has to be taken account that there may be differences between the immunogenic variations observed in HLA class I transgenic mice and that in humans primarily because the antigen processing, presentation and ultimately, immunodominance may differ between them. Further, it will be necessary to use SARS-CoV for viral challenge experiments at the final stage.",

Of note, the most immunogenic liposomal peptide, Lip-N223 efficiently induced protection against viral challenge with vaccinia virus expressing N-223 (Fig. 8). These data strongly suggest that the surface-linked liposomal peptide may offer an effective and safe CTL-based vaccine against SARS. However, in vivo CTL activity induced by Lip-N223 immunization was half of that induced by Ad-SARS-N8E (Fig. 4, Fig. 7) although the level of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells was similar between the Ad-SARS-N8E and Lip-N223 immunization (Fig. 2, Fig. 5). These data might suggest that liposomes disturb the CTL killing activity in some degree. Furthermore, a number of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells specific for N-317 were elicited in mice that had received one injection of Ad-SARS-N8E (Fig. 2). In contrast, three injections of Lip-N317 were required for the significant induction of N-317-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ CTLs in mice (Fig. 5). These data might suggest that an exogenous peptide conjugated on the surface of liposomes may be processed and presented to peptide-specific CTLs in a different way from a naturally processed, endogenous peptide derived from adenovirus.",

Although both effectively induce peptide-specific CTLs, there are several differences between them. Fist of all, self-adjuvanting lipopeptides stimulate peptide-specific CTLs via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 without any particular adjuvants [42], [43]. In contrast, induction of CTLs by surface-linked liposomal peptides requires external TLR ligands such as CpG [14]. However, it is well known that CpG causes toxicity in humans [44]. Hence, it is essential to find out a safe adjuvant for clinical use of liposomal peptides. Second, lipopeptides administered intranasally, sublingually or intravaginally are able to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses [43]. This application offers the advantage of needle-free delivery. It is, however, still under investigation whether surface-linked liposomal peptides intranasally stimulate peptide-specific CTLs.",

After 1 week, 51Cr-release assays were performed at various E:T ratios with RMA-HHD cells pulsed with (open symbols) or without (solid symbols) a relevant peptide as target. Data are shown as the means \u00b1 SD of triplicate wells. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. At least three mice per group were used in each experiment.",
