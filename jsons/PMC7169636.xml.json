            "text": "Viral rhinosinusitis is widespread and is what most people identify as the \u201ccommon cold.\u201d With the exception of herpes simplex and adenoviruses, viruses are not usually part of the normal flora of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Consequently, inoculation of the mucosa of the nose and paranasal sinuses by viruses leads to significant inflammation with subsequent obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex and impaired mucociliary clearance [8,9]. Because of the multitude of viral strains that can cause nasal and paranasal sinus inflammation, viral rhinosinusitis is quite prevalent. Pathogens in viral rhinosinusitis include more than 100 strains of rhinovirus, as well as influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Rhinovirus is the predominant etiology of the common cold and is capable of survival on surfaces for up to 4 days. When inoculation of the nasal cavity occurs with a virus-contaminated finger, infection will result in the majority of cases [7]. Clinically, patients experience a self-limiting illness lasting 3 to 7 days. Treatment is usually supportive with adequate hydration and nasal decongestants. Unfortunately, by creating ostiomeatal complex obstruction, impairing mucociliary clearance, and weakening mucosal integrity, viral rhinosinusitis predisposes patients to invasion of their nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa by trapped facultative aerobic bacteria and the development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [10\u201313].",

This diagnosis is based on symptomatology, clinical signs, and duration of symptoms [13]. Specific diagnostic criteria can be elicited through a detailed history and physical examination without the need for endoscopy or computerized tomography, which are often used as adjuncts in the clinical management. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis usually starts with marked mucosal inflammation from a viral upper respiratory tract infection or allergic rhinitis exacerbation. The mucosal inflammation, combined with retained secretions, constitutes an ideal medium for bacterial overgrowth.

In fact, strains from two of the most common bacterial isolates in chronic rhinosinusitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) have been proven to form biofilms [21]. This finding may explain why a subgroup of patients fails to improve or has frequent recurrence after medical and surgical management for chronic rhinosinusitis [21,22].

Diagnosis is made by histological evidence of invasive fungal hyphae (within the sinus mucosa, submucosa, blood vessels, or bone) in the nose and paranasal sinuses. Common pathogens causing this condition include aspergillus and fungi of Mucoraceae, of the order Mucorales, including Rhizopus and Mucor [23,24]. Aspergillus species are the most common pathogens identified in acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (Fig. 2.5). Although approximately 350 strains of this fungus have been identified, the three strains with pathological significance to humans are Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. The strain most commonly responsible for disease in the United States is A. fumigatus while A.flavus is most often associated with the indolent chronic invasive rhinosinusitis seen in the Sudan. Nonetheless, any of these Aspergillus species can cause fatal acute fulminant fungal rhinosinusitis. Treatment involves correction of the immunocompromised state, aggressive surgical debridement, and long-term systemic and topical antifungal agents. Recent reports suggest an increase efficacy of the antifungal posaconazole for fungal sinusitis refractory to standard antifungal therapy [25].\n\n",

In 1994, Bent and Kuhn described five major criteria found in this condition, namely, atopy, nasal polyposis, eosinophilic mucin without fungal invasion into soft tissue, characteristic computed tomographic findings of serpiginous areas of high attenuation in affected sinuses, and positive fungal stain [30]. Organisms commonly found in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis are primarily dematiaceous and include species of Alternaria, Bipolaris, and Curvularia [31]. Treatment of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis is mainly endoscopic sinus surgery, as well as systemic and topical corticosteroids. Because of the strong influence of atopy in the development of this condition, immunotherapy has been used with significant success.

When exposed to airborne irritants or bacteria, the Schneiderian epithelium of the sinonasal cavity increases its production of mucus, leading to suppression of bacterial overgrowth from the effects of the secreted antimicrobial products in the mucus, and increases mucociliary flow with the propulsion of trapped irritants and bacteria into the nasopharynx. A healthy and noninflamed sinonasal epithelium is paramount for optimal mucociliary clearance. In fact, many recent studies have demonstrated significant differences in mucociliary clearance between normal subjects and patients with rhinosinusitis [32\u201334].

These molecules, which are secreted by the sinonasal epithelial cells, are responsible for immobilization and destruction of microorganisms and play a vital role in immediate host defense against pathogens entering the body through the sinonasal mucosa. Lysozymes (secreted by macrophages, monocytes, and sinonasal epithelial cells) act against the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria and are highly effective against gram-positive bacteria. Lactoferrin (secreted and stored by serous mucosal glands) is a cofactor that enhances lysozyme activity against gram-negative bacteria. This antimicrobial acts as an iron-binding protein that inhibits bacterial growth through iron sequestration. Secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, which is also found in the sinonasal mucous blanket, has been shown to have in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as being able to inhibit neutrophil elastase [35\u201337].",

Th1 cells secrete cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which in turn activate macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, leading to phagocytosis and cytotoxic cell death. In contrast, Th2 cells secrete the interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, which promote IgG and IgE secretion, eosinophil production, and proliferation and maturation of mast cells. Each of these two immune pathways exerts an inhibitory effect on the cytokines produced by the other and causes polarization of the immune response [36].",
