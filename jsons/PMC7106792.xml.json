During fetal development, additional calcium is required to support skeletal formation and development. This demand is met by active maternal-foetal (transplacental) calcium transport, to achieve higher fetal than maternal serum calcium concentration [1]. Various mechanisms have been proposed, with recent recognition of the importance of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6; also referred to as vanilloid), an epithelial calcium-selective channel formed of four identical subunits, each with six transmembrane segments [2]. TRPV6 gene location and expression varies across species. In humans, the TRPV6 gene is located on chromosome 7q33-q34 and is very highly expressed in the placenta [3].",

Conversely, it is downregulated in pre-eclampsia, a condition associated with reduced placental calcium transfer [7].

All seven infants had biochemical abnormalities of secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism which completely normalised over several weeks. The skeletal abnormalities improved to varying extents over a longer timeframe during infancy. Our patient [12] showed more severe skeletal abnormalities than the other six cases, and much earlier in pregnancy. The variants in our case were different and the greater clinical severity is interpreted to have been the consequence of the different location of the pathogenic variants in this case compared to the other 6 causing more severe impact on TRPV6 protein function. Ultimately, this infant did not survive, due to the initial postnatal respiratory impairment, ineffective respiratory weaning and therefore complications of prolonged intensive care treatment. The detailed genetic findings on this infant were published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics 2018 and we refer the reader back to that publication for detail on in silico modelling and rationale of pathogenicity according to ACMG Guidelines. Whereas, in this publication, we focus on the post-mortem findings of this case, which are the first in TRPV6-associated skeletal dysplasia, shedding new insight into the abnormal bone architecture of this condition and skeletal development in the perinatal period.",

Consequently, we considered an alternative hypothesis of an in utero calcium deficiency caused by an intrinsic defect in placental calcium transfer. This prompted direct exploration of the candidate genes TRPV6, CABP9K and VDR. We performed a gene-agnostic trio analysis to identify very rare variants (Minor Allele Frequency < 0.0001) compatible with autosomal recessive or de novo inheritance. The likely causative variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. 12 This analysis identified compound heterozygous TRPV6 variants: novel maternally inherited missense variant, c.1978G > C p.(Gly660Arg), and paternally inherited nonsense variant, c.1528C > T p.(Arg510Ter); both classified as pathogenic according to ACMG Guidelines.",

TRPV6, a calcium-selective channel, plays an important role in maternal-foetal calcium transport via the placenta. Variants in TRPV6 may lead to insufficient calcium transport and abnormal skeletal development in utero. This leads to postnatal skeletal and biochemical abnormalities which progressively improve in the ex utero environment, as described in seven recent cases.12,13 Skeletal findings improved postnatally in all cases, although in our case [12] the phenotype was extremely severe. In particular, the abnormally small rib cage led to life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Her ventilator-dependency had been forecast to continue until approximately 18 months of age (her unexpected death aged 4 months meant this duration was ultimately not known). A further difference in this case, is that the skeletal dysplasia was evident much earlier antenatally, whereas in the Suzuki cases skeletal abnormalities were only evident from the third trimester onwards (earliest 28 weeks). Although maternal-foetal calcium transfer begins at 12 weeks gestation, the majority occurs during the third trimester so it had been hypothesised that foetal bone abnormalities would not be evident earlier [14]. We suspect that the significant skeletal dysplasia evident by only 20 weeks\u2019 gestation in this case reflects the severity of the compromise to calcium transfer resulting from severely impaired TRPV6 function. In support of this, the variants in TRPV6 identified in our patient were predicted, by in silico protein modelling, to result in unstable or misfolded protein which might lead to channel loss or impaired activity.",

Microscopically, the reduced bony trabeculae persisting in the diaphyses may reflect earlier absent or reduced calcium availability in utero, whereas the reactive chondrocytes in the growth plate suggest bone recovery and catch up in the normal calcium environment after birth. Significant bone remodelling occurs during growth, so the reduction in trabecular number might progressively normalise during childhood. Optimism arises from other recent cases suggesting normal postnatal growth, although duration is currently short with minimal linear growth details. Yet recent Trpv6 mouse model studies by Fecher-Trost give caution as cortical bone architecture remained abnormal in thickness with reduced femoral length [15].",

The cardiac histology was examined in detail, as calcium is essential for the conduction system and contractility of the cardiomyocytes. The post-mortem findings of a normal conduction system, along with the absence of identified arrhythmias during her first 4 months of life, provide no indication of a primary cardiac abnormality. The mild cardiac hypertrophy and disarray of the cardiomyocytes are non-specific findings and are post-mortem findings not uncommonly seen in post-resuscitation, consistent with recurrent adrenaline and/or corticosteroid administration. This correlates with the intensive care treatment provided in this case rather than a result of an abnormal calcium metabolism. Cardiac arrythmias were not mentioned in the other cases. Our histological findings do not raise abnormalities suggesting the need for cardiac surveillance in surviving infants and children.",

There was no pre-eclampsia and no maternal factors that could account for in utero calcium deficiency. Postnatally, oral calcium supplementation at physiological doses was given briefly to compensate for an expected persistent hypocalcaemia due to the skeletal calcium deficiency. However, normocalcaemia was maintained by a normal milk diet only, indicating normal intestinal calcium absorption in the postnatal period. The exocrine pancreas is another key site for TRPV6 expression in humans, although significance of its role is unclear. Unfortunately, histology in this case was non-contributory due to autolysis. But antemortem, there had been no clinical evidence of pancreatic exocrine gland dysfunction, suggesting its role may be minimal.",

Its upregulation in many malignancies already makes it a promising target for cancer therapy. Several groups have now developed systemic Trpv6 knock-out mice. The phenotypes are variable between different mouse lines but include male hypofertility, elevated PTH, growth retardation, poor bone mineralisation and dermatitis [16\u201318]. However, clinical correlation to human disease is not straight forward as organ-specific expression of TRPV6 varies between species. Studying the foetal development of Trpv6 knock-out mice will be extremely important in advancing our understanding of antenatal calcium homeostasis and identifying potential therapeutic intervention in disorders such as pre-eclampsia and TRPV6 under-mineralising skeletal dysplasia. While intra-amniotic calcium infusions could theoretically prevent or correct bone abnormalities, improving thoracic growth and optimising future lung function, their risk profile of pregnancy loss means they are not a realistic approach. It has been proposed that small molecular chaperones, such as those used in cystic fibrosis, could be used antenatally to correct the conformation of TRPV6 variants, although this remains hypothetical at present [13].",

The histology suggests that metaphyses had been compromised due to severe lack of calcium substrate, but then functioned normally, in fact possibly more active, in the postnatal environment. Bone development through collagen formation is intrinsically abnormal in the majority of skeletal dysplasias. TRPV6-associated skeletal dysplasia differs where the main feature appears to be compromised development of bone quantity resulting from extreme calcium lack during crucial in utero development. The post-mortem radiology and histology in our case suggested postnatal catch-up and recovery. Although, an effect might persist as the trabeculae remained reduced in number in the diaphyses. Whether bone remodelling throughout longer childhood growth can completely normalise bone length and density is currently unknown and will require close monitoring in other cases.",
