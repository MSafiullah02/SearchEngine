Compared to detection in sputum, detection of pathogens in the lower tract is thought to have higher specificity for typical bacterial pathogens and higher sensitivity for atypical pathogens such as Pneumocystis jiroveci, Mycobacterium species, and cytomegalovirus [Bartlett et al., 2000] , with the advantages being less clear for detection of respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) or Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP). Conventional methods of pathogen detection including antigen detection methods and traditional viral culture (TVC) do not usually allow for identification of newly identified viral pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] and the human coronaviruses (hCoV) OC43, 229E, and NL63 [Fouchier et al., 2004] . Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) has been used to rapidly detect viruses, MP and CP in nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) from patients with LRTI [Grondahl et al., 1999; Michelow et al., 2004; Miyashita et al., 2004] , and may be more sensitive than conventional methods, especially for MP and CP [Miyashita et al., 2004] .",

Rapid respiratory culture (RRC) with mixed cell lines (mink lung (Mv1Lu) and NCI H292) and immunofluorescent staining (Light Diagnostics TM , Chemicon 1 International) in a 24-well plate format [Lee et al., 1992; Huang and Turchek, 2000] was available from October 1, 2003 to July 30, 2004 only, and was performed when DFA tests were negative, not requested, or positive for PIV (as a confirmation of positive PIV DFA). TVC using standard cell lines (Rhesus Monkey Kidney cells and A549) was set up throughout the study unless a virus was already detected by DFA or RRC. Culture for MP was performed using respiratory Mycoplasma agar plates and a biphasic media with respiratory Mycoplasma agar and respiratory glucose broth.",

Additional experiments were undertaken during the validation and set up phases of the study to ensure the consistent performance of the published assays and to define the parameters for the new methods. A positive result in each assay was determined by the assessment of the threshold cycle number for each target in a similar way to that described previously [Welti et al., 2003] . Forty-five cycles were run for each assay and a significant increase in signal above background, together with a typical amplification curve, were used to delineate a specimen as positive for the target in question.",

(in press); Samuelson et al., 1998 ]. Five different NASBA reactions were set up for these targets with Flu A and Flu B in a single reaction tube, PIV 1 and 3 in a second tube, PIV 2 and 4 in a third tube, RSV (A and B) in a fourth reaction, and RV in the fifth. Any RV positive specimens were further tested by an enterovirus-specific NASBA to ensure specificity (the RV NASBA has some crossreaction with related non-rhinovirus picornaviruses at high copy number). All NASBA molecular beacon probes used fluorescein (FAM) as the 5 0 label with the nonfluorescent quencher 4-(4 0 -dimethylaminophenylazo) benzoic acid (DABCYL) on the 3 0 end. A positive reaction in the first screen was followed up by a repeat test in a monoplex format to differentiate between the positive targets for multiplex assays. Primers and probes for real-time NASBA were either as described previously [Hibbitts and Fox, 2002; Hibbitts et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004] were adapted to the real-time format from previous studies [Samuelson et al., 1998] or have not yet been published in any format (assays for Flu B and RSV). Primers and probes not previously published or adapted for this study are given in Tables I and II. ",

In previous studies in normal hosts, shedding of PIV as detected by TVC usually occurred for 3 to 10 days but sometimes persisted for months [Muchmore et al., 1981] and shedding of ADV occurred for a mean of 4 days but persisted for up to 17 days [Larranaga et al., 2000] . Shedding of MP could still be documented by culture in half of patients 6 to 8 weeks after acute infection [Foy et al., 1996] . Because NAT can detect much lower concentrations of pathogens, shedding of pathogens can be detected for a longer period of time than with conventional methods [van Kraaij et al., 2005] , and pathogens can potentially be detected from patients with remote infection or from patients with non-viable pathogens. Evidence that detection of respiratory viruses by NAT is not always of clinical significance is that 16% of 79 asymptomatic children had picornaviruses detected by NAT in NPS, and 19% of 84 samples from children with asthma remained positive for picornaviruses by NAT 2 weeks after an acute asthma exacerbation with no correlation between persistence of virus and symptoms [Jartti et al., 2004] , but there is less evidence of asymptomatic shedding of other respiratory viruses. Even if such shedding occurs, the clinical significance of pathogens detected by NAT may be greater for lower than for upper respiratory tract samples as the expected incidence of asymptomatic shedding in the lower tract is less. NAT for multiple respiratory viral targets was negative in BAL from 50 ventilated children [Akhtar et al., 1999] and 31 adults with no evidence of LRTI [Garbino et al., 2004] , suggesting that asymptomatic shedding of viruses in the lower tract is not common. *From 83 lower respiratory tract samples. Each patient was counted only once if repeat samples were positive for the same pathogen within a 10-day period (n \u00bc 8 additional samples from 6 patients), but they were counted again if they had different viruses (n \u00bc 2 additional samples from 2 patients) or the same virus more than 10 days apart (n \u00bc 6 additional samples from 6 patients).",
