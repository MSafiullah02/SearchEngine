Today, more than 70% of bacteria responsible for causing infectious disease are resistant to atleast one of the antibiotics employed in conventional antimicrobial therapy (Samanipour et al., 2016). Moreover, 80% of microbial infections in humans are caused by biofilm-forming pathogenic organisms. With the growing concern of MDR strains and associated biofilm, attention has been devoted to the development of new and effective antimicrobial agents. In the present scenario, the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is considered to open new windows to combat and prevent microbial disease. Owing to their high surface area to volume ratio and unique chemical properties, the nanomaterials have emerged as a reliable candidate as a potential antiinfective. Among the nanomaterials, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles exhibiting antimicrobial properties serve as a promising tool in controlling MDR strains.",

However, the use of toxic and expensive chemicals greatly limits its biomedical applicability. On the other hand, a broad range of microorganisms have been studied as potential biofactories for eco-friendly and cost-effective production of metallic nanoparticles, such as silver, titanium oxide, cadmium sulfide, gold, etc. Thus, research in microbial nanotechnology provides a reliable way for large-scale synthesis of nanomaterials (Barapatre et al., 2016). The use metallic preparations of gold, copper, silver, iron, and lead, as well as alloys in healthcare, can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Microfine metallic powders were used for both external and internal applications, in a wide variety of diseases. Traditionally, gold has been used as an antipruritic medication to suppress itching palms. It influences the immunological response and controls the anaphylactic release of histamine. Iron compounds act as a rejuvenator and as a restorative agent. They are particularly administered in diseases such as iron-deficiency anemia. They also stimulate the functional activity of all the organs and combat a number of diseases (Galib et al., 2011). Silver in various forms including silver metal, silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, silver acetate, and silver protein are well known for their antimicrobial properties (McDonnell and Denver Russell, 1999). Copper exerts broad-spectrum biocidal effects on bacterial cells and spores, fungi, and viruses. It damages the microbial envelope, membrane phospholipids, intracellular proteins, and nucleic acids. It is widely recommended in the treatment of ulcers, skin conditions, syphilis, and tuberculosis (Borkow, 2014). Zinc and its salt forms have been employed as therapeutic agents for centuries in topical as well as oral treatment. They are recommended in a number of dermatological disorders and infections including warts, cutaneous leishmaniasis, leprosy, inflammatory dermatoses, melasma, and basal cell carcinoma. Oral zinc, when given with dapsone (adjuvant), results in significant bacterial clearance in patients with lepromatous leprosy. The use of zinc acetate gel, in vivo, was found to prevent the sexual transmission of HSV-2 and HIV infection. Due to its antibiofilm activity on dental plaque forming microorganisms, zinc citrate or acetate are blended in many oral products, including toothpaste (Gupta et al., 2014).",

Nanoparticles of size range 100 nm and less have become an area of extensive research due to their antimicrobial properties attributed to their large surface area. Metal nanoparticles like gold, copper, titanium, silver, and zinc nanoparticles have attracted tremendous attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics, which include antimicrobial, catalytic, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Hence, nanoparticles currently play an important part in diagnostics, drug delivery, gene therapy, and tissue engineering (Hamouda, 2012). With the integration of nanoparticles in the development of new health and pharmaceutical products, it is essential to develop eco-friendly and biocompatible techniques for the production of metal nanoparticles. The use of plant extracts, enzymes, bacteria, fungi, and algae provides an environmentally safe route for the production of nanoparticles. The main focus of nanotechnology is to synthesize monodispersed nanoparticles with predictable shape, size, and polymeric coating for potential biomedical applications (Sharma et al., 2015). Metal nanoparticles with inherent antimicrobial property or when coated with an antimicrobial entity on the surface increase their applicability in biomedical devices, textile industries, water treatment, and food packaging. The nanocomposites constituting of metal nanoparticles and polymers provided enhanced synergistic antimicrobial activity (Gutierrez et al., 2010).",

Researchers in the field of nanotechnology and nanomedicine have turned to biological systems. In this regard, the microbial cells are considered as promising biofactories for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. In the past decade, several research groups have successfully synthesized inorganic nanoparticles such as gold, iron, silver, lead, and calcium, either extracellularly or intracellularly using microorganisms like bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, yeast, and algae.

However, it is important to study and elucidate the biochemical pathways of the microbes that lead to metal ion reduction and formation of nanoparticles, to exercise a stringent control over size, shape, and constitution of the particles (Gericke and Pinches, 2006). The microorganisms mediated biosynthesis of nanoparticles depends on numerous physical parameters and culture conditions. Hence, standardization of these conditions is necessary for higher yield of nanoparticles with desirable properties. The size of the particle may be controlled by the stringent control of parameters such as temperature, pH, salt content, and time of exposure. For instance, the synthesis medium containing 5 mM of AgNO3, reaction temperature of 60\u00b0C, and pH 10 resulted in the synthesis of Ag-NPs, within in 30 minutes using culture supernatant of E. coli.

Nanoparticles of various sizes and particle morphologies including spherical, triangular, oval, hexagonal, etc. have been synthesized using microbes. It has been speculated that the particles synthesized intracellularly are usually smaller and monodispersed as compared with those synthesized extracellularly. The intracellular fungal mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles resulted in nanoparticles of various morphologies and sizes (Gericke and Pinches, 2006). The particles were predominantly spherical in shape and formed in the cytoplasm of the cells. In the case of extracellular synthesis, by tuning the reaction conditions the desired shape and size may be achieved. For example, Gurunathan et al. (2009) reported the synthesis of Ag-NPs and a reduction in particle size by employing optimal a concentration of AgNO3, reaction temperature, and pH. The increase in understanding of shape and size-dependent properties of nanomaterials has motivated new developments on the biosynthesis route. Moreover, better control of size and shape has led to new developments in materials science.",

This unusual characteristic of nanoparticles can be avoided by stabilizing and protecting them from self-aggregation using capping agents. Capping reduces the surface energy and maintains the size of the nanoparticles in the range below 100 nm. The choice of capping agent depends on the characteristics of the nanoparticles and its intended application. Amino acids, polypeptides, and tiopronin have been employed as the capping agent for biological applications. Further, the geometry and solubility of the nanoparticles are also influenced by the properties of this capping agent used. Stabilizing agents such as surfactants, polymers, dendrimers, and biomacromolecules are also used for capping the nanoparticles to enhance their stability and prevent further agglomeration (Perni et al., 2014).",

Perni et al. (2014) documented the synthesis of l-cysteine capped Ag-NPs using cell extract of E. coli. The Ag-NPs prepared exhibited remarkable antibactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. Spherical shaped Ag-NPs were prepared using exopolymer isolated from the culture supernatant of Ochrobactrum\nrhizosphaerae. The exopolymer responsible for synthesis and capping of the Ag-NPs was characterized and found to be glycolipoprotein (GLP) in nature. The purified exopolymer was successfully employed to prevent agglomeration and maintain the stability of the Ag-NPs. Further, significant antibacterial activities of the GLP\u2013AgNPs conjugate, more prominent than antibiotic (ciprofloxacin), was observed against Vibrio cholera. Owing to their small size and high surface-to-volume ratio, the GLP\u2013AgNPs ruptured the cell wall and caused cell lysis in the test pathogen, V. cholera (Gahlawat et al., 2016)",

Iron oxide nanoparticles of 18\u00b14 nm size were prepared using an aqueous extract of the brown alga, S. muticum at 25\u00b0C. The reduction in the FeCl3 to Fe3O4 nanoparticles was brought about by the polysaccharides present in the algal extract (Mahdavi et al., 2013). In some cases of fungal mediated production of nanoparticles, the biosynthesis of nanoparticles is followed by fabrication of the nanoparticles by stabilizing/capping agents. The capping agents are usually the extracellular proteins from fungal mycelia. The presence of natural capping agents terminates the postproduction steps of capping required for medical applications of the nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles are well studied and reported for their profound antimicrobial property on several multidrug-resistant bacteria. The extracellular biosynthesis of Ag-NPs using cell-free filtrate of phytopathogenic fungus, M. phaseolina (Tassi) Goid was reported by Chowdhury et al. (2014). The synthesized Ag-NPs nanoparticles were found to be naturally coated and stabilized by 85 kDa protein. Arun et al. (2014) reported the extracellular and the intracellular synthesis of biofabricated Ag-NPs by a mushroom fungus, Schizophyllum commune, when grown in culture medium supplemented with AgNO3. The Ag-NPs exhibited remarkable antibacterial and antidermatophytic activity against Pseudomonas sp., B. subtilis, K. pneumonia, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, E. coli, Trichophyton simii, and Trichophyton rubrum. Similarly, Jain et al. (2011) demonstrated a cost-effective and eco-friendly synthesis of biofabricated Ag-NPs using the cell-free extract of Aspergillus flavus NJP08. The presence of extracellular capping protein on the Ag-NPs was revealed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The SDS\u2013PAGE profiles showed the presence of two intense bands of 32 and 35 kDa confirming the presence of extracellular proteins, which might be responsible for the synthesis and stabilization of Ag-NPs. A cost-effective extracellular synthesis of nano bowl-shaped silver nanoparticles using Trichoderma viride was documented by Chitra and Annadurai (2013). The presence of two protein bands of 45 and 39 kDa indicated the presence of capping agent on the Ag-NPs. Further, the synthesized Ag-NPs exhibited a considerable bactericidal activity against Klebsiella planticola (2277) and B. subtilis (3053).\n",

            "text": "Several mechanisms were proposed to justify the antimicrobial property of Ag-NPs. It is believed that the positive charge of Ag+ ion of the Ag-NPs causes electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial property (Kim et al., 2007). It is also suggested that Ag-NPs exhibit high affinity for the sulfur-containing protein present inside the cells as well as in the bacterial membrane. Subsequently, the bacterial cell in contact with Ag-NPs takes up the Ag+ ions, thereby resulting in inhibition of the cellular functions and respiratory enzymes (Kim et al., 2007, Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011). Ag-NPs affect the permeability of the plasma membrane and cell viability (Chaloupka et al., 2010). It was also suggested that the Ag+ ion released from Ag-NPs interacts with the phosphorus-containing elements such as DNA, causing a damaging effect on DNA replication and protein synthesis (Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011, Chaloupka et al., 2010, Gogoi et al., 2006). In fungi, Ag+ of the Ag-NPs inhibits DNA replication and the respiratory chain as well. At lower concentration of Ag-NPs, the Ag+ ions have been reported to inhibit respiratory chain enzymes, which resulted in uncoupled respiratory electron transport from oxidative phosphorylation. Due to the high affinity of the Ag+ for the sulfhydryl (thiol) groups present on the membrane-bound respiratory enzymes, the Ag+ interferes with the electron transport chain and transfer of energy through the membrane (Bard and Holt, 2005, Allaker and Memarzadeh, 2014). At higher concentration, Ag+ ions have been shown to cause a detrimental effect on the cytoplasmic components and nucleic acids of the cell (Dibrov et al., 2002, Lara et al., 2010). Like most of the metal NPs, Ag-NPs also have the ability to generate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacterial cells. They show better antimicrobial properties mediated by the production of ROS like H2O2, which exert metabolic stress inside the cell, subsequently causing cell death (Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011).",

Hence, the antibacterial activity may be regulated by controlling particle size of the Ag-NPs. The large surface\u2013volume ratio facilitates interaction of the Ag-NPs with the cell membrane and allows easy penetration inside the cell, thereby causing complete damage to cell viability (Blecher et al., 2011). Ag-NPs of ~10 nm a diameter readily form pores in the bacterial cell wall. Consequently, the cytoplasmic content gets released out of the cell, ultimately leading to cell death. Ag-NPs of size less than 20 nm (in diameters) increases the permeability of bacterial cells by attaching to sulfur-containing proteins of the bacterial cell membranes (Morones et al., 2005, Gogoi et al., 2006, Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011). Ag-NPs with triangular and truncated shape readily release Ag+ and hence exhibit greater antimicrobial activity (Blecher et al., 2011).",

Various studies have revealed the possibility of conjugating gold nanoparticles with antibiotics to enhance their antibacterial efficacy. Rai et al. (2009) reported the synthesis of spherical Au-NPs fabricated with cefaclor, a second generation antibiotic. It was found that the amine group of cefaclor acts as reducing as well as capping agent in the synthesis of Au-NPs. The cefaclor fabricated Au-NPs were found to exhibit better antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) as compared with gold nanoparticles and cefaclor, taken separately. The synergistic activity was studied and it was revealed that Cefaclor suppresses the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall, thereby making the cell wall porous. The Au-NPs also generated holes in the cell wall, causing the leakage of cytoplasmic contents and ultimately leading to cell death. Au-NPs may also inhibit the uncoiling and transcription of DNA by binding to the DNA of bacteria. Coating of aminoglycosidic antibiotics with Au-NPs significantly increases their antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Grace and Pandian, 2007, Saha, 2007). The antibacterial efficacy of vancomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was profoundly enhanced when coated with Au-NPs (Gu et al., 2003). Recently, Fayaz et al. (2011) used nonpathogenic fungus, T. viride, to synthesize Au-NPs, at room temperature. The synthesized Au-NPs when conjugated with vancomycin by the ionic interaction efficiently suppressed the growth of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. It was found that the Au-NPs penetrate inside the bacterial membrane resulting in the death of the cells. Stable biofabricated Au-NPs coated with antibiotics, rifampicin, vancomycin ciprofloxacin, and gentamycin significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the antibiotics against S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (Ahangari et al., 2013). Brown et al. (2012) found that Au-NPs conjugated ampicillin (Au-NPs\u2013AMP) exert bactericidal effect against numerous MDR bacteria, including MRSA, Enterobacter aerogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. It is speculated that the coating of ampicillin molecules on the surface of Au-NPs allows the Au-NPs\u2013AMP to suppress the beta-lactamases expressed by the bacterial pathogens. Further, Au-NPs\u2013AMP also hampers the proper functioning of transmembrane efflux pump, which is responsible for efflux of drug from the bacterial cell. Hence, Au-NPs may be used to coat the surface of a wide variety of medical devices and implants.",

The potential application of CuO-NPs as antiinfective agents lies in their extremely high surface area and desirable crystal morphologies (Kwak and Kim, 2005, Stoimenov, 2002). A few mechanisms contributing to the antimicrobial property of the CuO-NPs have been proposed. CuO-NPs may adhere to the bacterial cell walls, owing to their positive charge. CuO-NPs interact with carboxyl and amine groups present on the surfaces of microbial cells. Therefore, bacteria with higher density of these ionic groups on their cell surfaces, such as B. subtilis, have higher affinity for and are highly susceptible to CuO-NPs (Blecher et al., 2011, Huh and Kwon, 2011). However, Gram-negative bacteria like Proteus spp. and P. aeruginosa are less susceptible to the positively charged CuO-NPs (Rupareli et al., 2008).",

The Al2O3-NPs when attached to the bacterial cell surface causes structural deformities to the cell wall. These nanoparticles cross the cell membrane and this eventually results in loss of membrane integrity, as a consequence of intracellular oxidative stress. Al2O3-NPs show higher mutagenicity and sensitivity against Pseudomonas fluorescens compared with its bulk counterpart (Balasubramanyam et al., 2010). Likewise, nanoalumina also exhibits a better antibacterial effect of towards E. coli, B. subtilis, and P. fluorescens as compared with the bulk materials. The nanoparticles significantly decrease the extracellular protein content of the bacteria. It was found that Al2O3-NPs at a concentration of 1000 \u00b5g mL\u22121 show a mild antibacterial effect against E. coli. The interaction of the nanoalumina with the bacterial cells results in distortion in cell morphology and agglomeration of particles in the cell wall (Mukherjee et al., 2011). Ansari et al. (2014) investigated the antibacterial efficacy of Al2O3-NPs against multidrug-resistant strain of E. coli isolated from clinical sample. It was found that Al2O3-NPs exert structural modification in the phospholipids layer, subsequently resulting in loss of amphiphilic properties of the cell wall, destruction of the membrane and leakage of cellular components. It is suggested that Al2O3-NPs interact with l-\u03b1-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the bacterial cell wall through hydrogen bonds and ligand exchange. The binding of NPs to the surface of cell membrane results in the formation of irregular-shaped pores and perforation on the bacterial cell surfaces. It is proposed that the Al2O3-NPs might have caused adverse effects by interacting with the intracellular biomolecules and eventually triggering cell death. Ansari et al. (2015) suggested that Al2O3-NPs may be exploited as a potential antimicrobial agent to target extended-spectrum, nonextended-spectrum and metallo-\u03b2 lactamases strains of P. aeruginosa.",

The small size of the nanoparticles also contributes to its antimicrobial property. Nanoparticles ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm readily penetrate inside the cell membrane of E. coli and react with intracellular oxygen, thereby resulting in oxidative stress and disruption of the cell membrane.

Moreover, ZnO-NPs show selective toxicity towards targeted bacteria and exert minimal toxicity to human cells (Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011). ZnO-NPs possess potent antimicrobial properties and use several mechanisms to combat pathogen, thereby making it unlikely to develop resistance against them. ZnO-NPs are thought to adhere strongly to the cell membranes and damage both the lipids and proteins components of the bacterial membrane, which subsequently leads to increase in permeability of cell membrane and cell death (Hajipour et al., 2012). The generation of ROS and release of Zn2+ ions are few of the mechanisms proposed to describe the antimicrobial efficacy of ZnO-NPs. ZnO-NPs induce the release of ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2212). The generated H2O2 on the surface of ZnO-NPs penetrate inside the bacterial cells and damage the cell membrane (Allaker and Memarzadeh, 2014, Padmavathy and Vijayaraghavan, 2008). However, the negatively charged OH\u2212 and superoxides are unable to enter the cell membrane and remain on the surface of the cell. The release of Zn2+ ions also damages the cell membrane and the intracellular components (Brayner et al., 2006, Blecher et al., 2011, Huh and Kwon, 2011). It was observed that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coated ZnO-NPs increases the permeability of the cell membrane and imposes oxidative stress on entering the cytoplasm (Huh and Kwon, 2011).",

ZnO-NPs in different form such as nanorods, nanoplates, flowers, needles, dandelions, helixes, rings, springs, and snowflakes have been synthesized (Yamamoto, 2001). The generation of H2O2 increases with the increase in surface area of the ZnO-NPs. It is presumed that with decrease in particle size, the ZnO particles per unit volume increases, resulting in overall increase in surface area and release of hydrogen peroxide (Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011). According to Vidic et al. (2013), ZnO nanostructures of 100 nm in diameter exhibit significant antibacterial efficacy against B. subtilis and E. coli. Jin et al. (2009) reported that ZnO nanoparticles of ~12 nm in size inhibited the growth of E. coli by disrupting the cell membrane and increasing its permeability. Pati et al. (2014) indicated the potential application of ZnO-NPs as antibacterial agent against S. aureus. The destruction of membrane integrity, decrease in cell surface hydrophobicity, and downregulation in the transcription of oxidative stress resistance genes were observed on exposure of the bacterial cell to ZnO-NPs. Liu et al. (2009) investigated the antibacterial efficacy of ZnO-NPs against verocytotoxigenic E. coli strain O157:H7. A considerable destruction in the membrane integrity and leakage of intracellular contents was observed without much effect to nucleic acid (Liu et al., 2009). ZnO-NPs also possess significant inhibition efficacy against methicillin resistant strains of S. aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (Hajipour et al., 2012).",

Multiple strategies have been have been suggested to justify the antibacterial property of Mg-ONPs, a few of which include generation of lipid peroxidation, ROS generation, enzyme inhibition, alkaline effects, and electrostatic interactions. The production of ROS results in lipid peroxidation in the bacterial cell envelope, which in turn facilitates the entry of the NPs through the plasma membrane. Consequently, the cytoplasmic pH drops, which raises the membrane potential causing the intracellular cytoplasmic components to exude out of the cell. The strong electrostatic interaction between the MgO-NPs and the bacterial cell surface also contributes to the antibacterial activity. The alkaline effect on the surface of MgO-NPs, due to the formation of a thin layer of water molecules, damages the bacterial cell membrane when it comes in contact with MgO-NPs, ultimately resulting in cell death (Rudramurthy et al., 2016).",

MgO-NPs were found to exhibit antagonistic effect against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. In addition, they also exhibit biocidal activity towards spores and thus, may be employed as an effective disinfectant against a wide range of pathogens (Rudramurthy et al, 2016).",

The production of exopolysaccharide (EPS) leading to the subsequent formation of biofilm is one of the major virulence determinants contributing to the development of MDR strains of pathogenic organisms. EPS matrix consisting of polysaccharides, proteins, eDNA, and cellular debris makes the pathogen inaccessible to the host defense system and antibiotics. Hence, the biofilm matrix confers an increase in antibiotic resistance in the case of biofilm-associated diseases like gingivitis, otitis media, and cystic fibrosis. They are responsible for many nosocomial as well as chronic infections associated with medical devices and surgical implants (Chen et al., 2013; Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013). The difficulty in eradication of these pathogens lies in the fact that the biofilms are highly resistant and inaccessible to the antimicrobial agents.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have the ability to invade the biofilm matrix and gain access to inside the microbial cells. As depicted in Fig. 15.2\n, they attach to the bacterial cell wall, infiltrate inside the cell membranes, and accumulate inside cells, resulting in a continuous liberation of ions inside the cell (Ansari et al., 2013). Nanoparticles have received tremendous attention for their ability to inhibit/disrupt biofilm formation for possible clinical applications. Ag-NPs effectively prevented biofilm development in extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli by restricting bacterial growth and production of EPS. The antibiofilm property of the Ag-NPs may be exploited towards the development of Ag-NPs based coatings for medical devices and implants. These NPs may also be used in the management of various infections caused by drug-resistant biofilm forming bacteria (Ansari et al., 2013). Among the leading nosocomial pathogens, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis are capable of colonizing medical devices and catheters resulting in biofilm-related infections of the urinary and lower respiratory tract. Selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) prepared using Bacillus sp. MSh-1 were found to exhibit antibiofilm efficacy against biofilm producing clinically isolated nosocomial pathogens. The nanoparticles significantly suppress the biofilm formation in S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa, by 42%, 53.4%, and 34.3%, respectively. It was also revealed that the effect of Se-NPs on the development of biofilm was considerably determined by the temperature and pH (Shakibaie et al., 2015). Selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) synthesized using Actinobacterium, Streptomyces minutiscleroticus M10A62 was able to completely inhibit biofilm formation in six Acinetobacter species within 48 hours of incubation. The inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved with 3.2 \u00b5g concentration of Se-NPs indicating the direct interaction of target bacteria with the nanoparticles resulted in inhibition of biofilm at low concentration (Ramya et al., 2015). Ag-NPs prevent E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans, and P. aeruginosa from forming biofilm on plastic catheters (Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013). Ag-NPs produced by the lignin-degrading fungus Emericella nidulans and A. flavus inhibited biofilm formation in Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) bacteria. At a concentration of 0.5\u201364 \u00b5g mL\u22121, the Ag-NPs significantly decreased 74%\u201384% biofilm formation as compared with fungal cell-free filtrate (devoid of Ag-NPs) showing 4%\u20136% antibiofilm activity (Barapatre et al. 2016). Zero-valent bismuth nanoparticles completely inhibited growth and formation of biofilm by Streptococcus mutans (Hernandez-Delgadillo et al., 2012). Selenium and tellurium nanoparticles prepared using Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITE02 and Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1 were found to posses antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1, E. coli JM109 and S. aureus ATCC-25923 (Zonaro et al., 2015).",

For example, thin film composite (TFC) membranes coated with TiO2-NP damages the cell membrane of E. coli, thereby preventing the adherence of bacteria onto the surface of the TFC membrane and inhibiting biofilm formation (Blecher et al., 2011). According to Hajipour et al. (2012), ZnO-NPs coated glass surfaces prevented biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus by generating ROS. Metal nanoparticles conjugated to photosensitizers also resulted in an increase in their antibiofilm efficiency. Photoactivated Au-NPs bound to methylene blue were found to inhibit biofilm formation in C. albicans (Khan, 2012). Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles coated with Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on the formation of biofilm on catheters by C. albicans and Candida tropicalis. Reports suggested that the antibiofilm activity of the NPs is governed by the dimension and size of the nanoparticles. The high surface to volume ratio plays a vital role in imparting antibiofilm property to the nanoparticles. Thus, the decrease in the size of the NPs corresponds to increase in their activity. Small sized MgF2-NPs coated glass surfaces inhibited adherence of bacteria, S. aureus and E. coli, to surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation (Pelgrift and Friedman., 2013). The colonization and growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilm on membranes was decreased by over 98.7% when coated with Ag-NPs, with an average diameter 12.6\u00b15.7 nm at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM. The biofilm formation by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was notably arrested by 65% and 88%, respectively, in presence of starch-stabilized nanoparticles (~20 nm in diameter), even at very low concentrations of 1\u20132 mM (Markowska et al., 2013).",

The nontoxic and nonimmunogenic Au-NPs serves as an ideal carrier for drug delivery. Nanocomposites of Au-NPs doped with antibiotics have been employed for the selective photothermal killing of pathogenic microorganisms. Gold NPs themselves are considered inert and do not affect bacterial growth, however, conjugating antibiotics with Au-NPs significantly increases their antibacterial activity. Gold NPs synthesized using nonpathogenic fungus, T. viride, may be conjugated with vancomycin to form Vancomycin-bound biogenic gold nanoparticles (VBG-NPs). The VBG-NPs exhibited remarkable antimicrobial efficacy against drug-resistant E. coli and S. aureus. The antibacterial activity is proposed to be as a result of the nonspecific binding of VBG-NPs to the transpeptidase of Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strain (Fayaz et al., 2011). Au-NPs have also been shown to efficiently deliver and increase the concentration of drug at the targeted site. Hence, they are used as drug carriers to selectively and specifically target cells, thereby increasing the efficiency of the drug in treating acute infections, without causing adverse effects (Shahverdi et al., 2007). Au-NPs when coated with Cefaclor, a second-generation \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, and ampicillin results in a profound increase in antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria (Yin et al., 2015).",

APDT involves the use of a photosensitizer (PS), usually a nontoxic dye in combination with a harmless visible light. The irradiation of the PS generates ROS that selectively destroy microbial cells and biofilm. ROS such as hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022), superoxide (O2\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) cause the oxidation of biomolecules, that is, proteins, lipids, and DNA inside the cell. It is also responsible for the damage to the cell wall and increases in membrane permeability, which results in leakage of cytoplasmic components. Since the microbial inactivation is a multitarget process, the possibility of development of resistant strains is minimal. Owing to the differences in the cell wall structures, the Gram-negative bacteria are found to be less susceptible to APDT as compared with the Gram-positive ones. Microorganisms such as yeasts, fungi, and viruses were also found to be susceptible to APDT (Yin et al., 2015).",

Nanoparticles are used as a drug carrier to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, decrease side effects, minimize enzymatic degradation, prolong their circulation, and increase their bioavailability. It was established that the antimicrobial activity was greatly enhanced when PS was covalently bound to nanoparticles. At present, inorganic metal oxide (ZnO, TiO2, and MgO) nanoparticles have gained much interest as antimicrobial agents due to their high biocompatibility and stability. A significant bactericidal activity of ZnO, Ag, and TiO2 in the presence of UV light against P. aeruginosa and MRSA has been documented. The use of nanoparticles aids in the attachment and uptake of PS by the microbial cells and they are more easily exposed to the lethal ROS. APDT holds promising applications in self-sterilizing urinary catheters, antibacterial surgical, and dental implants. APDT may also be successfully employed in the management of periodontitis, root canal disinfection, gingivitis, oral candidosis, burn wounds, and acne (Perni et al., 2011, Yin et al., 2015).",

These nanoparticles act as the PS itself or interact with the PS either by conjugation or the nanoparticles. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are the most common PS and their ability to act as a photocatalytic antimicrobial agent is well established. The high reactivity of nanobased TiO2 is extensively exploited for their bactericidal activity in the development of filters and coatings of glasses, ceramics, alumina, and polymers. As a photosensitizer, it possesses photocatalytic properties that allow the destruction of pathogenic microbes. When irradiated with UV light of wavelength less than 385 nm, TiO2 results in the photocatalytic generation of active free hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2212), which catalyze the killing of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It also brings about photocatalytic oxidation of biofilm components on TiO2-coated surfaces and prevents biofilm formation. Suspensions containing TiO2 were found possess bactericidal effect on E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, planktonic cells, and spores of Bacillus cereus. It has been suggested that in an aqueous medium, nanostructured TiO2 irradiated with UV light may be employed as an efficient way to eliminate virus such as hepatitis B, influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, polio virus type 1, SARS, and coronavirus. TiO2 can successfully kill fungi, including A. niger, C. albicans, and Cryptosporidium parvum (Ravishankar and Jamuna, 2011; Yin et al., 2015).",

Au nanorods coated with PS destroy MRSA cells by synergistic antimicrobial and photothermal effect. S. aureus can be inhibited using laser activated Au-NPs fabricated with antibodies.

            "text": "A wide range of antimicrobial drugs are available and prescribed to treat infectious diseases caused by various fungi, bacteria, and viruses. However, the inefficient delivery of these conventional drugs to the target site results in inadequate therapeutic effects and undesirable side effects. Other limitations include difficulty in administration due to their low solubility, lack of target specificity, cytotoxic to host tissues, and rapid degradation and clearance from the body (Ranghar et al., 2014). Delivering the right dose of drug precisely and safely to the specific target at the right time is the main goal in the designing of an ideal drug delivery system (Li et al., 2011). In this regard, NPs have emerged as promising drug delivery systems. It is well reported that the metal-based nanoparticles serve as an effective antimicrobial agent against common pathogens. Owing to their small size, they are highly reactive and readily taken up by the host as well as microbial cells (Zhang et al., 2010). The surface properties of the NPs can be tuned to attain controlled release of the pharmacologically active agent at a specific site at a therapeutically optimal rate and dose (Ranghar et al., 2014). The drug molecules are generally loaded to the nanoparticles adsorption, physical encapsulation, or chemical conjugation to increase the therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics of the drugs (Zhang et al., 2010). Many advantages of nanoparticles based drug delivery have been recognized, including improvement in solubility of the drugs, increased circulation lifetime, controlled release of drugs, specificity, and selectivity of the target (Zhang et al., 2010). The use of nanoparticles as carrier allows delivery of optimum doses of a drug to the targeted site, thereby reducing the risk of resistance mechanisms and minimizing toxicity to patients (Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013) They also increase the stability of a variety of therapeutic agents such as oligonucleotides and peptides. The surfaces of Au-NPs can be readily functionalized with ligands containing phosphines, thiols, and amines, which exhibit high affinity for gold surfaces (Li et al., 2011). When administered, the drug-loaded nanoparticles can enter the host cells via endocytosis. Once inside the host cell, these nanoparticles release drugs during the course of time, that then kill the intracellular pathogen (Zhang et al., 2010). The accumulation of required dose of the drug at the site of infection eliminates the intracellular bacteria before the development of resistance. Nanoparticles may be fabricated with antibodies to specifically target antigen present on the surface of the targeted microbe. These nanoparticles based antimicrobial drug delivery systems help in distinguishing the target microbes or infectious cells from healthy cells, allowing specific targeting ability. For example, Au-NPs coated with antibodies against protein A have been successfully employed to selectivity kill S. aureus. Functionalized TiO2 magnetic NPs are used to target several types of bacteria, including S. pyogenes (Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013). Aptamers also exhibit in vitro antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase producing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They also possess antiviral efficacy against reverse transcriptase of HIV and inhibits replication of Vaccinia virus (Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013). Due to the above-mentioned reasons, numerous nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have been approved to treat a variety of diseases and many others are currently under various stages of clinical trials.",

This chapter discusses the synthesis of nanoparticles by various microorganisms, the synthesis mechanisms, and their potential applications to solve the problem of drug resistance in numerous pathogens. Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous development in the field of microorganism mediated synthesis of nanoparticles and their applications. Owing to the rich biodiversity, microorganisms as a biofactory serve as an environmentally safe and sustainable method for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Actinomycetes, yeast, algae, fungi, and bacteria have been successfully employed for the enzymatic synthesis of safe and stable metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. The ease of cultivation and manipulation of microorganisms also gives the advantage to manipulate the synthesis rate and the associated parameters. The synthesis process takes place either extracellularly or intracellularly by the aid of microbial enzymes. The biosynthesized nanoparticles naturally capped with protein/lipid layer imparts stability and physiological solubility to the nanoparticles, making them suitable for biomedical applications. Metals and metal oxide nanoparticles possess remarkable bactericidal, fungicidal, and antiviral properties, demonstrating their potential as a promising tool in antimicrobial therapy. The potency of these nanoparticles is significantly governed by physical characteristics including shape, size, and stability. Different metallic NPs, such as silver, gold titanium, copper, and magnesium, are known for their antimicrobial efficacies. Many nanoparticles exhibit bactericidal properties by generating ROS and in some cases penetrate inside the cell membrane and release metal ion. Due to their small, controllable size and property, functionalized nanoparticles have emerged as an effective carrier in drug delivery. The recent progress and the ongoing research in functionalization gave way to new avenues for commercial applications of functionalized nanoparticles in medicine and healthcare. Nanoparticles show a significant increase in biocompatibility and activity when conjugated with other materials. Nanoparticles fabricated with antibiotics, dyes and antibodies exhibit enhanced antimicrobial activity. The nanoparticles exhibiting antimicrobial property are being explored for their application in prosthetic device coatings, catheters, ointments and gels, and in dental implants. Further, the application of nanoscale antimicrobials in the management of life-threatening diseases, facilitated by their fascinating microbicidal and drug delivery capabilities, is of ongoing interest. Further, research on microbially synthesized nanoparticles possessing unique optical, physicochemical, and electronic properties is of great significance for application in medicine. Thus, nanoparticles in the field of antimicrobial chemotherapy have gained much attention as an eco-friendly agent to fight microbial resistance and prevent diseases.",
