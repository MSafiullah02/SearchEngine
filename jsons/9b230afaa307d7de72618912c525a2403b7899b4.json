Physicians often order diagnostic tests and may prescribe antibiotics when they are unsure of the cause of the illness and are concerned about the possibility of serious bacterial infection. However, in most cases, fever and respiratory symptoms are caused by viruses. In addition, in children in whom a virus is found to be the cause of their illness, the risk of serious bacterial infection is very low. This review was conducted to assess whether a rapid viral test done in the ED changes what physicians do when treating these children. We found that in previously healthy children coming to the ED with fever and respiratory symptoms, a rapid viral test reduces the use of chest X-rays and that there is a trend toward less antibiotic usage, and blood and urine investigations. The true impact of this intervention on the latter three outcomes requires trials with larger enrollment numbers.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a serious public health issue and rank among the top five causes of illness and hospitalization in children. During influenza seasons, fever and respiratory infection symptoms make up to 25% of all reasons for a visit to an Emergency Department (ED) (Silka 2003) . Although ARIs can be caused by bacteria, they are most commonly caused by viral infections. A rapid diagnosis of a viral infection may lead to a decrease in the use of antibiotics, additional testing and possibly admissions. The most commonly implicated causal viruses are influenza (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza (1, 2 and 3) , rhinovirus and adenovirus. These viruses account for 35 to 87% of children with an ARI. The variability in the range of positive viral diagnosis may be affected by the choice of viral tests used and their scope of viral detection (Jennings 2004; Weigl 2000) . There is a risk of concurrent bacterial infection in children with a confirmed viral ARI. A study of children aged 3 to 36 months with recognizable viral infections showed a concurrent rate of bacteremia of 0.01 to 0.8% (Greens 1999) . A prospective multicenter study of infants less than 60 days old with an ARI showed a significant difference in the rate of urinary tract infection between RSV positive (5.4%) and negative infants (10.1%), a non-significant difference rate of bacteremia (1.1% and 2.3%) and no cases of bacterial meningitis among the 251 RSV positive infants and 8 cases out of 938 RSV negative infants (not statistically significant) (Levine 2004). However, symptoms of viral ARI overlap with those of bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis) and in some cases, are difficult to distinguish. Without a confirmed viral diagnosis, medical assessment and diagnostic tests are often used before a decision on patient management, parental advice, and/ or hospital admission are made. These precautionary tests lead to intense use of human health resources (nursing, laboratory and radiology staff ) and hospital facilities. Furthermore, these tests are often invasive, sometimes unnecessarily prolonging a child's visit to the ED, resulting in sub-optimal ED service provision and contributing to lengthy ED wait times and overcrowding.",

            "text": "ARIs impose large costs on the health system, from a high number of physician visits, ED visits, hospitalization and antibiotic prescriptions. Studies comparing health care utilization for ARIs in children 0 to 15 years old during influenza season and the rest of the year showed significant excess in physician visits (28,000 to 51,000/100,000 age specific population annually), ED visits (~1600/100,000 age specific population annually), hospital admission (300 to 9500/100,000 age specific population annually) and antibiotic prescription (31,000/100,000 age specific population annually). Most of this burden came from children below three years of age (Menec 2003; Neuzil 2000) . A study comparing the costs associated with a visit to the ED versus a primary care provider, showed that the average cost for assessing a patient for an ARI in the ED (excluding antibiotics cost) is $206 to $221 and in comparison is $101 to $106 in a primary care provider's office. Up to 60% of patients with a common cold are treated with antimicrobials, which costs $37.5 million annually (Rosenstein 1998), despite most ARIs being caused by viruses. The physician and nursing costs only contributed to 17.5% of ARI management costs (Martin 2000) . This suggests that extra investigations and antibiotic prescribing in the ED may be responsible for much of any unnecessary costs. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, there was access to rapid respiratory viral diagnosis in acute care settings; (that is, provision of same-day identification of influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3), RSV and adenovirus. This enabled rapid, informed patient management decisions and helped with triaging. This suggests a role for rapid viral diagnosis in alleviating the burden on EDs and improving health service delivery and health resource allocation, in the situation of increased use of EDs for ARI symptoms. A prompt viral diagnosis might improve decision-making and reduces unnecessary hospital admittance, prescription of antibiotics, and further diagnostic investigations. This is supported by observational data from retrospective chart reviews of children admitted to hospital, with subsequent confirmed diagnosis of adenovirus infection, which revealed a change in management for 36%, including revision of antibiotic treatment and use of antiviral therapy (Rocholl 2004) . Similarly, chart reviews of children testing positive via a rapid influenza diagnostic test were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics in the ED (20% versus 53%; P = 0.04) and when admitted were on antibiotics for fewer days (3.5 versus 5.4 days; P = 0.03) (Noyola 2000). Children with an early diagnosis of influenza also had fewer blood tests (17% versus 44%; P = 0.02) and urine tests performed (2% versus 24%; P = 0.006), compared to those children with a late diagnosis (Sharma 2002).",

Data were analyzed and reported separately for these two populations. We only considered the study population enrolled from the ED. The goal of the study was to assess whether a rapid diagnosis of influenza affects the evaluation and treatment of children with acute respiratory illnesses. Approximately 20% of their study population were deemed highrisk medical participants, as defined in the publication Red Book (CID 2003) , any patient for whom influenza vaccination is recommended (1. Children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, including asthma; 2. Children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus; 3. Children and adolescents who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and, therefore, might be at risk for developing Reye's syndrome after an influenza infection). The primary trial author was contacted for further clarification. Of these 20%, only five participants had a condition which may have met our exclusion criteria (congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia of unknown severity and possible immune defect reported by parents but unrelated to chemotherapy). The rest had asthma which is not an exclusion criteria for our review. Raw data excluding these five participants was obtained from the primary author and used for this meta-analysis. Re-analyzed data showed a trend for lower rate of blood and urine investigations and chest radiography but a higher rate of antibiotic prescription in participants with rapid influenza results available to the treating physician, but none of these findings were statistically significant. Details pertaining to participants, outcome measures and limitations are found in the 'Charateristics of included studies' tables. Iyer 2006 This was a prospective, quazi-randomized, controlled trial assessing participants presenting to a large, urban, tertiarycare pediatric emergency department. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of rapid Influenza diagnosis on physician management of previously healthy febrile participants, aged two to 24 months, at risk for serious bacterial infection. Despite the fact that this study only mentioned fever as an inclusion criteria, close to 90% of the children enrolled in the study also had symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. This study reported no significant differences in mean length of ED visit, laboratory testing, chest radiography or antibiotic use, and return to ED visit rates between the two study groups per original randomization. Details pertaining to participants, outcome measures and limitations are found in the 'Charateristics of included studies' tables. Doan 2009 This was a single center, open-label, randomized, controlled trial assessing participants presenting to a large Canadian tertiary center pediatric ED.

The goal of the study was to assess the effect of a rapid diagnosis of influenza on the management of children with influenza-like illnesses. Children meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized to undergo tonsillar/pharyngeal swabs for rapid influenza testing or standard care. Results of influenza testing were made available to the treating physician within approximately 10 minutes, who then decided on further testing and management. Endpoints analyzed in this study included: rates of routine blood examinations, chest X-rays, antibiotic prescription and days on antibiotics, admission to hospital, and antiviral drug use. In this study, participants with a positive influenza diagnosis were significantly less likely to receive routine blood examinations or be prescribed antibiotics when compared with those not receiving rapid viral testing. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to rates of chest X-rays or admission to hospital. If children were prescribed antibiotics, there was no difference in length of antibiotic use. No children were prescribed antivirals. This study was excluded due to the fact that children with underlying illnesses were included. The study included children with congenital heart disease, asthma, malignancy, neurological deficits, and cystic fibrosis. Abanses 2006 This was a large single center RCT assessing healthy participants aged three to 36 months presenting to a large urban pediatric ED (64,000 patient visits per year) with fever. The goal of the study was to assess how rapid influenza testing of febrile infants and children affected physician decision-making with respect to diagnostic testing as well as ED charges and patient time in the ED. Although the inclusion criteria were based on fever, this paper was analyzed as a large proportion of children (> 60%) were found to have respiratory symptoms in the form of tachypnea. Children meeting inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups. One group had rapid influenza test results available to the treating physician prior to assessment while the other group had influenza testing done only at the discretion of the treating physician after initial assessment. Study endpoints, as stated above, were: rates of diagnostic testing, ED charges, and length of ED visit. Although block randomization is mentioned, what is described is actually cluster randomization by 24 hour periods. Despite the initial intent to conduct an RCT, non-adherence to the protocol led to a significant number of participants not receiving the treatment they were randomly allocated to receive. A decision was made to analyze data as per actual treatment received, hence a convenience sample. Although there is mention of ITT analysis yielding no significant difference in the outcome measures between the two study groups, the results were not reported. Due to the failed randomization, this study did not meet this review's inclusion criteria.",

The primary objective was to compare oseltamivir use and secondary objectives included comparisons of clinical presentation, ancillary testing and antibiotic use between the two study groups. This study found that with participants enrolled in pediatric offices where rapid influenza testing was used, oseltamivir was used more frequently (37.9% versus 13.7% P < 0.0001). Antibiotics (9.5% versus 3.9% P = 0.008) and chest radiography (4.0% versus 1.2% P = 0.035) was also more frequently used in the rapid influenza testing group.

Although a weak trend for a reduction in antibiotic prescription rate was shown, this was not statistically significant and the results of individual trials on this outcome were conflicting, making the current evidence not yet applicable. Most studies of rapid viral testing have been aimed at detecting influenza virus only, except for one, which used a multi-respiratory viral panel. While a multi-viral panel can capture a larger number of viruses, the test used by Doan 2009 was laboratory bound and not as freely accessible to clinicians as the rapid influenza test, which can be performed at the bedside and therefore offers a much more rapid result to the treating physician. Although point of care testing for RSV is available and has been shown to have high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (92%) Mackie 2001 we have not found any trials using rapid RSV testing meeting the criteria for our review. Considering that RSV and influenza formed 73% to 95% of the positive viral tests in the study by Doan 2009, perhaps using point of care testing for influenza and RSV in the ED through future studies would provide more evidence to support the practice of rapid viral testing in the ED. The evidence we gathered through this review is still lacking information on key issues surrounding implementation of rapid viral testing in the ED. We have found no information on safety and side effects of this intervention, nor cost comparisons between the rapid viral test and the averted ancillary testing by using this intervention. It will be difficult to evaluate the value caregivers assign to averting blood sampling, radiography exposure and unnecessary antibiotics, as well as shortening their ED visit and may require a different approach from RCTs.",

Although Levine 2004 and Byington 2004 reported lower rates of bacterial infections in febrile infants less then three months old who tested positive for viral infection, the rate of bacterial urinary tract infection in that group was not negligible (up to 7%). It is possible that physicians may still be apprehensive in dismissing the potential for a concurrent urinary tract infection, despite the presence of a virus and persist in ordering urine tests and prescribing precautionary antibiotics. Urinary testing is dependant on obtaining a urine sample, which in young children may take a long time, hence prolong the ED length of visits. However, Purcell 2002 reports rate of bacterial infection (all were urinary tract infections) in febrile RSV positive children up to two years old (1/3 were less then three months old) to be much lower at less than 1%, which puts into question this precautionary practice, at least in children over three months old.",

These demonstrated that a positive rapid viral diagnosis decreased the number of ancillary tests, antibiotics prescribed, and ED length of visits. While it is interesting to see that a positive result can decrease the amount of additional tests, the question is whether the rapid viral test is worth doing before one knows its result. As rapid viral diagnosis requires an invasive and uncomfortable test for the children (either through nasopharyngeal swabs or washings), it is important to determine how it may affect the outcome of the tested population as a whole. In the four studies mentioned above, the rate of positive viral diagnosis ranged from as low as 19% to 66% (19% to 52% for influenza testing alone and 66% for multi-viral testing). Therefore, at least one-third of the children received an invasive test that may not have altered the course of their work-up or management. As one cannot definitively predict whether a child will have a positive test prior to doing it, this represents a large number of non-helpful tests, which will actually add to the burden presented by children with febrile respiratory illnesses.",

As so few studies were included in this review, pooled results still lacked power to definitively determine the effect of rapid viral testing. We concluded that further sub-grouping of participants would unlikely yield significant information and did not run such analyses. ",
