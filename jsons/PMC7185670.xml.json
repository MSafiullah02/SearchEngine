Sequencing primers specific to other fragments of viral genes were employed to amplify the positive samples for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The sequences showed the genetic variation of viruses circulating in the region, and identified the virus evolution and introduction of new variants. This study allowed cartography of viral etiology of a large panel of viruses that were co-circulating in ARI in children in a district of Shanghai, with the aim of implementing a monitoring system for endemic or epidemic viral respiratory infections.",

The DNA band with the size of 550\u2013574 bp corresponded to rhinovirus while the band with the size of 600\u2013700 bp corresponded to enterovirus. Hence, the mRT-PCR could detect 15 viruses.

In addition, studies showed up to 30% of co-infection in hospitalized children40 and RSV co-infection was associated with clinical severity.38, 39 However, no such correlation was found in this study. This may be due to differences in the criteria of patient enrollment and in the lower severity of clinical signs observed. Bacteria-virus co-infection was commonly found in inpatients. In our study, only polynucleosis (>10,000 on absolute count) was considered as a sign of bacterial infection and was observed in 30 patients infected with a respiratory virus. Hence, future studies should focus on severe respiratory infection to identify viral determinants of disease severity and should introduce bacteriological test.",
