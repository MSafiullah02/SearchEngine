In addition, the BAL has been associated with several complications in patients receiving MV, especially with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other related complications are hypoxemia, pneumothorax, cardiac arrhythmias and bleedings. Therefore, the risks/benefits of BAL should be carefully considered in the critical patient scenario prior to the application, using the technique when less invasive methods presents limitations or are not effective for diagnosis [10].",

Therefore, it is necessary that less invasive diagnostic strategies be used instead of BAL. An alternative method for obtaining respiratory samples in mechanically ventilated patients is the mini bronchoalveolar lavage (Mini-BAL); a simple, less invasive and low-cost method. It is defined as a blind and sterile technique for collection of the lower respiratory specimen by a tracheal tube (50 cm) and instillation of saline solution. The amount of instilled solution may range from 20 to 150 ml. However, small amounts of fluid (e.g. 20 ml) are commonly used [11].",
