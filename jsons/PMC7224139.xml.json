            "text": "In recent years, surgical education has increased its focus on the non-technical skills such as communication and interpersonal relationships while continuing to strive for technical excellence for procedures and patient care. An awareness of the ethical aspects of surgical practice that involve non-technical skills and judgment is of vital concern to surgical educators and encompasses disparate issues ranging from adequate supervision of trainees to surgical care access. The general ethical principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice as outlined by Beauchamp and Childress [1] offer a framework for a study of surgical ethics with an understanding that overlap as in a Venn diagram occurs with ethical issues in the African context (Table 1). Autonomy may include decisions involving the family and community as well as honoring religious beliefs; beneficence requires quality and safe medical care; non-maleficence may involve refusing to provide services outside one\u2019s area of expertise; and justice can include access and affordability as well as research that benefits the community in which it takes place as well as the local researchers. Topics of interest include:access to care (socioeconomic issues and distance from health facilities);resource utilization and decision making based on availability and cost of resources, including ICU and terminal extubation;informed consent (both communication about reasonable expectations post-procedure and research participation);research ethics, including local projects, international collaboration, authorship;quality and safety including supervision of less experienced professionals;religious and cultural issues that may affect any ethical decision making.",

            "text": "Informed consent plays an essential role in both clinical practice and research. The ethics surrounding informed consent involve two areas of medical/surgical practice: (1) consent for procedures with an accurate understanding of risks and benefits and realistic view of post-procedure or treatment outcome; and (2) informed consent for inclusion in a research study with full disclosure in understandable language of any possible risk. Informed consent has cultural, social, and even professional implications as well. In clinical practice, studies reveal that not all surgeons obtain informed consent for every operation or procedure. Patients undergo operations without knowing who will operate or the reason for the operation or even what operation will be performed. Patient satisfaction was captured in African settings, but little information was found describing patient understanding of possible outcomes from operation including quality of life [9\u201311]. A Nigerian study of informed consent forms used in 33 tertiary-care facilities revealed a relatively difficult reading level (13\u201315 years old), absence of information such as permission for transfusion, tissue disposal, and anesthesia risks, with less than 10% mentioning provision for an interpreter or answering patient\u2019s questions, and only about 11% describing specific risks [12]. Just as the role of the physician in Western healthcare has evolved from the final arbiter of decision making to a collaborating partner with the patient (and perhaps family), the view of collaborative decision making will be seen more frequently in the African context as education increases awareness of this issue. An increase in knowledge of litigation is occurring in the African context as well, so this may also play a role as it has in the West [13]. The physician or researcher seeking informed consent must remember to consider community/family decision making in the African context rather than total autonomy of the patient [14\u201316].",

            "text": "Quality and safety should be aimed for in all areas of surgical and medical care. Quality and safety include supervision of less experienced professional trainees and non-surgeons who perform surgical procedures [17\u201319]. The literature documents that supervision is sometimes occasional for inexperienced trainees in situations where they may be primary surgical providers. A survey of medical officers in Ghana reported that during their training period they were not supervised for a significant number of the reported procedures (7 of 42 Cesarean sections; 5 of 26 exploratory laparotomies; 8 of 23 inguinal herniorrhaphies; and 4 of 18 appendectomies) [20]. Meara and colleagues in 2015 cited the need for increased supervision of new graduates after formal surgical training as well as for more training and supervision of associate clinicians and general practice physicians who perform operations, anesthesia, or obstetrics [21]. In Kenya, newly trained surgery residents may be posted to district hospitals where they face a number of challenges including lack of supervision in addition to inadequate surgical instruments and low volume of cases. Therefore, a need for improvement is required if the district hospital is to provide a suitable environment for a first posting of newly qualified surgeons [22]. Some countries such as Niger are recognizing the need for regular, if not continuous, supervision of those general practitioners trained to do surgical procedures wherein general surgeons make periodic visits to district hospitals to provide continuing education and supervision [23].",

The lack of health professional human resources in Africa as well as the concentration of health professionals in urban areas is well documented [30\u201332]. The lack of sufficient surgeons across the continent is being addressed through initiatives of the West African College of Surgeons (WACS), College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA), Association of Surgeons of South Africa (ASSA), Pan African Association of Surgeons (PAAS) [33], Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS) [34], and other groups dedicated to training surgeons as well as holding high standards for practicing surgeons and providing continuing professional development (CPD). Ethical issues arise when access is complicated by available care that is unaffordable or is scarce as noted for burn care in the Republic of South Africa [35]. The private, for-profit health enterprise is growing but can be expensive. Significant care in SSA has been provided by faith-based medical institutions dedicated to providing services at low cost in underserved and economically challenged areas; but increasingly these hospitals may charge fees too steep for many in the communities. As noted above from the Lancet indicators, grave economic devastation may face families involved in long-term and complex medical care resulting from medical catastrophes such as road traffic injuries, chronic illness, or cancer. African physicians frequently understand medical costs and may factor these into discussions with colleagues as well as treatment options offered to patients. Universal free or low-cost health care, one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is an answer but financing is problematic in low-resource environments [36]. This has been attempted in a number of countries such as Ghana, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya, and Rwanda through income-based health insurance schemes and other government programs [37, 38].",

On a macro-level, some studies seek to understand the economics and resource utilization in the African healthcare sectors [41]. On a micro- or local level, heathcare expenditures and efficiencies are affected by unnecessary operation cancelations, unwillingness to perform terminal extubation, and national formularies that determine resource allocation [2, 42\u201345]. Terminal extubation and end-of-life decision making are fraught with cultural, ethical, and legal ramifications. Very little data exist about attitudes toward terminal extubation in Africa; for example, 0.2 ICU beds per 100 hospital beds are found in Zambia [46]. At the 2013 Durban Ethics Round Table, participants were asked to respond to the statement, \u201cThere is no moral difference between withholding and withdrawing a mechanical ventilator\u201d; of 22 respondents, five were from South Africa (the only African country represented) and four of those five agreed. One salient fact is the lack of specific legal protection in South Africa for withdrawal of support. \u201cWithdrawing of ventilator support is not universal. However, even when withdrawing mechanical ventilation is acceptable, the approach to achieve this end point is highly variable and individualized\u201d [47]. There was majority agreement for many but not all statements describing healthcare professional end-of-life decision making [48]. Only 11 responses, all from South Africa, were in this study for Consensus for Worldwide End-of-Life Practice for Patients in Intensive Care Units (WELPICUS) study [49]. A subsequent article \u201cAdding Africa\u201d was published in 2015. They pointed out the sparse Africa participation and gave a plea for further study in the African context.",

When collaboration involves international partners, appropriate recognition for all those involved becomes more complex, especially when results are ready for publication [55]. Authorship rules vary widely and some Western groups such as the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) set such strict guidelines that important contributors could be relegated to acknowledgment rather than authorship if they must meet all four criteria (drafting design, writing or revising, approving, and accountable for accuracy) when, in fact, meeting even one of the criteria likely made the project possible [56].",

Using Western-generated protocols may be acceptable in the short term, but studies should be developed that seek answers in the local environment. Employing literature databases such as AJOL and Bioline increases the exposure to African-generated research. Using only predominantly Western-focused databases has some ethical shortcomings. International collaborators must be intentional in including African colleagues in research projects from the planning stages through the completion, data analysis, and final written reports and must offer co-authorship as well as acknowledgment for contributions [57]. For example, Chu and colleagues, in their study on research collaboration in Africa, point out that in Rwanda, legal as well as ethical guidelines pertain to involving local investigators in research projects and the subsequent authorship for published reports [58]. Rwanda Ministry of Health documents state: \u201cIn the event that the PI is foreign, it is important the Rwandan collaborator be a co-PI on any publication, consistent with the guidelines for authorship addressed in the Roles and Responsibilities of Investigators document\u201d [59]. \u201cDoes the investigator team have a local Rwandan Investigator(s)? Not applicable if Principal investigator is a Rwandan. All research investigation teams must have a minimum of 30% of Rwandan Investigators\u201d [60].
