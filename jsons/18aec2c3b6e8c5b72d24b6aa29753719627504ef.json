Additionally, we were interested in the effect of ribavirin on clinical outcomes. We demonstrated that treatment of RSV LRD with aerosolized ribavirin in HCT recipients was consistently associated with decreased probability of overall death and death due to respiratory failure in multivariable models. Although our results suggest a stronger protective effect for aerosolized ribavirin over systemic ribavirin ( Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B) , the number of patients who received systemic ribavirin in this cohort is small (n = 13) and therefore these results should be interpreted cautiously.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 337, "text": "(Supplementary Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 754, "end": 786, "text": "Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Ribavirin has been available for the treatment of RSV infection for >30 years; its use in HCT recipients has been controversial due to the low quality of evidence to support its use.

Oxygen use may serve as a marker for extent of lung injury, and its association with poor outcomes confirms previous findings [26, 29, 37] .
