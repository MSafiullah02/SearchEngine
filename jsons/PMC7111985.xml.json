            "text": "HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are a family of small molecules specifically designed for blocking the activity of the HIV aspartyl-protease (for a review, see Flexner, 1998). The PI treatment leads to the block of HIV maturation with consequent release of non-infectious viral particles (Kaplan et al., 1993). PIs exert their inhibitory effect by disabling the enzyme before it can cleave the Gag\u2013Pol polyprotein into its essential products. PIs, together with anti-HIV compounds targeting alternative steps of the virus life cycle, are part of the most advanced anti-HIV therapies allowing millions of infected people to co-exist with the virus experiencing a good quality of life. However, it is now clear that PIs can also directly or indirectly inhibit the activity of many cell proteases. In particular, PIs can inhibit the activity of both 20S (Andr\u00e9 et al., 1998) and 26S (Pajonk et al., 2002) proteasome subunits, as well as that of caspases (Badley, 2005), with alterations in the susceptibility to apoptosis stimuli. Both expression and release of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be also targeted by PIs (Bourlier et al., 2005, De Barros et al., 2007) with consequences in the extra-cellular matrix modeling and, more in general, in the cell\u2013cell communication. In addition, PIs have been found inhibiting cell signaling pathway involving both NF-\u03baB (Dewan et al., 2009) and AKT (Kumar et al., 2009, Srirangam et al., 2006). From a clinical point of view, the PI treatment may induce beneficial effects other than those against HIV, as in the case of Kaposi sarcoma regression (Sgadari et al., 2002), but can also have detrimental consequences, as for the dyslipidemia occurring in PI-treated HIV patients (Calza et al., 2004).",

In this latter case, low pH is required to induce the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes, a phenomenon leading to the release of virion contents into cytoplasm. Although the viral fusion process is guided by the presence of viral envelope proteins, the contribution of cell proteins is critical. Using RNA interference as a tool for gene expression inhibition, it was demonstrated that several cell proteins are involved in the mechanism of entry of many viruses including HIV-1 (Brass et al., 2008, Nguyen et al., 2006), influenza (Hao et al., 2008), west Nile (Krishnan et al., 2008), Borna disease (Clemente et al., 2010), human hepatitis C (Ng et al., 2007), and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) (Pelkmans et al., 2005) viruses. Ideally, these cell products might represent potential antiviral therapeutic targets.",

Hence, PIs do not affect the amounts of HIV release from infected cells, but dramatically decrease their infectivity. Surprisingly enough, however, the HIV-1 release from cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope protein from VSV (VSV-G) has been found inhibited by PIs in single cycle replication assays. In fact, when CEMGFP cells, i.e., a human T CD4+ lymphoblastoid cell line expressing GFP under the control of HIV-1 LTRs (Gervaix et al., 1997), were infected with 100 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/105 cells of (VSV-G) \u0394env HIV-1, decreased percentages of HIV-1 expressing cells were observed in ritonavir-treated cells as compared to control conditions (Fig. 1A). The outcome did not change by challenging the cells with doses up to 300 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/105 cells (not shown). Conversely, and as expected, the PI-treatment had no apparent effects on single cycle replication of non-pseudotyped HIV-1, as tested in PI-treated cultures of CEMGFP cells infected with wt HIV-1 (Fig. 1B). In these experiments, the presence of T-20 (i.e., a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion) (Kilby et al., 1998) added 16 h after challenge ensured that the wt HIV-1 replication was limited to a single cycle. As anticipated, ritonavir blocked the spread of wt HIV-1 in multiple-cycle replication assay (Fig. 1B).",

This viral mutant expresses a PI-resistant viral protease as a consequence of the four amino acid substitutions in the protease gene, i.e., M46I, L63P, V82T, and I84V (Condra et al., 1995). First, the real resistance to PIs of PM4 HIV-1 was checked by evaluating the percentages of CEMGFP infected cells 6 days after the infection in the presence or not of ritonavir (Fig. 1C). Then, CEMGFP cells treated with T-20 were infected with (VSV-G) PM4 HIV-1 in the presence or not of ritonavir. This experimental setting was representative of a single-cycle replication assay since T-20 disabled both HIV-1 Env-mediated viral entry and possible cell re-infections. Similarly to what observed with (VSV-G) \u0394env HIV-1 strain, a significant inhibitory effect of ritonavir on the HIV-1 expression was detected in (VSV-G) PM4 challenged cells (Fig. 1D). This strongly suggests that the viral protease activity was not involved in the PI-induced inhibition of (VSV-G) HIV-1 expression.",

To this end, HeLa cells were pre-treated overnight with different concentrations of six PIs, i.e., ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and atazanavir. Then, the cells were challenged with 0.2 m.o.i. of VSV. After 1 h of adsorption in a small volume, the viral inoculum was removed, the cells extensively washed, and incubated for additional 8 h in the presence of PIs. Afterwards, the supernatants were harvested and titrated for the amounts of infectious VSV. As depicted in Figs. 2A\u2013B, a strong reduction of VSV replication (more than 2 logs) was observed when the cells were treated with 2.5 \u03bcM saquinavir and nelfinavir. The inhibitory effect appeared more potent (up to about 4 logs) by increasing the concentration of these PIs to 10 \u03bcM, and remained significant (i.e., more than 1 log) by increasing the m.o.i. up until 1 (not shown). No differences were observed when the PIs pre-treatment was carried out for 2, 4, 6, or 8 h (not shown). As calculated through a wide dose\u2013response curve, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of saquinavir and nelfinavir were 1.4 and 1.1 \u03bcM, respectively. On the other hand, significant inhibition of viral replication were detected in ritonavir and indinavir treated cells starting to the concentrations of 20\u201330 \u03bcM (Fig. 2B). The IC50 of ritonavir and saquinavir were 16 and 14 \u03bcM, respectively.",

The cytopathic effect was monitored 24 h post challenge. The outcome of this assay was scored in terms of the viral dilutions no more able to induce cytopathic effect.

To this aim, cells were treated with different PI concentrations for 8 h, then labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and thereafter refed with complete medium in the presence of PIs. CFSE was expected to be equally distributed upon cell division, then resulting in a halving of the overall cell fluorescence after cell duplication. Cytotoxic effects were measured in terms of inhibition of the cell duplication as detectable by the impairment of the halving of the CFSE-associated cell fluorescence. Fig. 2D reports the mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) measured in cell cultures treated with different concentrations of the PIs active against VSV replication. Block of cell duplication with cell mortality over 20% has been detected using 100 \u03bcM ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir, while indinavir showed a much lower cytotoxic effect. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values of PIs (Fig. 2D, insert) were calculated as the doses inhibiting by 50% the fluorescence halving, expectedly a consequence of the block of the duplication in 50% of cells. The therapeutic indexes (i.e., CC50 divided by IC50) appeared higher than 22 for both saquinavir and nelfinavir. This is suggestive of specific antiviral effects for these PIs.",

To this aim, the well characterized influenza virus/MDCK cell system was considered. MDCK cells were treated overnight with different PIs, and then challenged with m.o.i. 0.1 and 0.5 of the PR8 influenza virus. After challenge, the cells were extensively washed, and reseeded in medium without serum in the presence of both PIs and tosylamido-2-phenil ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. Twenty-four h later (i.e., the expected time for the completion of the replication cycle of influenza virus) (Sidorenko and Reichl, 2004, Smith and Ribeiro, 2010), the supernatants were harvested and titrated for the contents of infectious particles. A strong inhibition of the replication of influenza virus (up to 4 logs at the lower m.o.i.) has been detected with 10 \u03bcM saquinavir and 5 \u03bcM nelfinavir (Fig. 3A). Ritonavir inhibited the viral replication less efficiently (Fig. 3A), while indinavir, amprenavir and atazanavir appeared ineffective (not shown). In the interpretation of these data, it should be emphasized that the inhibitory effect of PIs cannot be a consequence of a PI-induced impairment of the activation of the hemagglutinin envelope protein (HA) of the influenza virus, which is a step required for productive infection (Steinhauer, 1999). In fact, influenza virus preparations used for challenges were exclusively recovered from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs, where HA is cleaved by egg proteases. Consistently, TPCK-trypsin did not influence the infectivity of the virus preparations in single cycle replication assay (not shown).",

First, the possible effects of PIs on the virus attachment on target cells were investigated.

In fact, using the same experimental conditions described for the endocytosis assay, it was reproducibly observed that, early after VLP challenge, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) VLPs was near 2-fold higher than that of cells treated with (fd VSV-G) VLPs. More significantly, in the latter condition both percentages of fluorescent cells and MFI heavily dropped 16 h after challenge. On the contrary, both FACS parameters appeared only slightly reduced in cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) VLPs (Fig. 7A). These differences can be explained by the fact that, due to the inability of fd VSV-G to induce fusion and delivery of the VLP contents into cytoplasm, the NefG3C-GFP molecules incorporated in (fd VSV-G) VLPs were addressed to rapid degradation into the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Conversely, the efficient fusion between viral envelope and endosome membranes induced by wt VSV-G allowed the release of NefG3C-GFP molecules into cytoplasm, where they are expected to be degraded with a kinetic much slower than that operating in endosomes/lysosomes.",

The results showed that, within the cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) NefG3C-GFP VLPs, the PI treatment reduced both MFI and percentages of fluorescent cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest PI concentrations, both parameters reached levels similar to those detectable in cells challenged with (fd-VSV-G) NefG3C-GFP VLPs (Fig. 7C). Hence, it seemed that the PI treatment diverted the fate of endocytosed (wt VSV-G) towards that of (fd VSV-G) VLPs.

To test whether PIs affect intracellular pH, both HeLa and MDCK cells were labeled with LysoSensor Green DND-189. This reagent becomes fluorescent only in acidic intracellular compartments, meanwhile exhibiting decreased fluorescence intensity upon pH increase. Thus, it represents a useful reagent for detecting possible pH variations in endosomes. Cells were treated overnight with the PI doses most effective against VSV and/or influenza virus replication, then labeled with LysoSensor Green DND-189 for 30 min in the presence of PIs, and finally analyzed by FACS. As control, cells treated with bafilomycin A1, i.e., a powerful inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, were also tested. As depicted in Fig. 8\n, no significant variations in the cell-associated fluorescence have been detected in PI-treated cells as compared with control conditions, indicating that PIs do not affect the intracellular pH.

Hence, the selective targeting of cell products supporting virus replication could represent a successful antiviral strategy. The results from the here described investigations indicate that drugs designed to counteract the activity of the HIV protease show a strong inhibitory effect against unrelated virus species likely by targeting yet unidentified protease activity(ies) of target cells. The antiviral potency of the most effective PIs reached about 4 logs in the reduction of virus yields, with therapeutic indexes higher than 15. The PI-induced effect against VSV appeared comparable in magnitude to that observed in cell treated with type-1 interferons (Masters and Samuel, 1983). On the other hand, the potency of PIs against the influenza virus replication appeared comparable to that of most potent inhibitors. Among these, T-705 (Furuta et al., 2002) reduced the viral yield of the most susceptible influenza strain tested of at best 2.7 logs at the concentration of 5 \u03bcM upon MDCK cell challenge with 0.01 m.o.i. (Sleeman et al., 2010). DAS181, i.e. a sialidase fusion protein, blocked the influenza virus replication at sub-micromolar concentrations, however when MDCK cells were challenged with 0.001\u20130.005 m.o.i. (Triana-Baltzer et al., 2009). Conversely, micromolar concentrations of PIs induced more than 3 logs of reduction of the influenza virus yield from MDCK cells challenged with 0.5 m.o.i.",
