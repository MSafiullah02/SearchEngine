Declaring a national emergency provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) with additional authority to waive certain Medicare and Medicaid requirements for the duration of the national emergency. One area where we have received numerous questions is related to providing telehealth. Below is an overview of the Medicare telehealth waiver issued by the Secretary in response to this national emergency. As a general caveat, the information below applies to Medicare requirements for the provision of telehealth but does not apply to state requirements or the requirements of other insurers. It is also important to note that these waivers apply to all Medicare patients and providers during the national emergency and does not have to be specific to the treatment of a patient with COVID-19. Additional information regarding the telehealth waiver, and other policy developments related to COVID-19, can be found on the American Association of Nurse Practitioners \u00d2 (AANP) COVID-19 practice and policy resources page.",
