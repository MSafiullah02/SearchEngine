Non-essential business in addition to schools and universities were closed. Healthcare professionals directed by their health authorities have found themselves rapidly involved in the pandemic emergency either directly by being frontline in the management of patients presenting with COVID-19 or indirectly by reducing or canceling non-urgent consultations and surgeries. Those measures were taken not only to lower the spread of the disease but also to help reduce the use of inpatient resources, materials such as gowns, gloves and eye protective shields, and to redeploy professional workers to the services in need[2].",

For example, physical evaluation can be adapted to the teleconference without direct physical contact with the patient[6]. Confidentiality between health care worker and the patient changed from being very discreet in a closed examination room to virtual online where it can be breached despite the high security and encryption. The latter led to the rise of new ethical considerations for confidentiality and information storage; as an additional element to the paper or electronic chart, the recording of virtual consults must be stored in a secure way. In many facilities where telemedicine was not used routinely, general online platforms were used initially out of necessity; this should be regulated as soon as possible. More application of telemedicine can become the standard after the pandemic. As an example, established patients with a known condition or those who have had their surgery already can be followed virtually, which can save travel time and cost. However, physicians\u2019 fees should be adapted to this new concept. The requirement of an in-person physical exam can be per physician discretion. New guidance using virtual care should be developed especially for those patients who radiologically do not fit the criteria for urgent surgical intervention, which will facilitate their access to specialist evaluation, lower the waiting time and help triage surgical patients. Coding and billing of virtual consults was routine for some physicians but, in some jurisdictions, a new code was developed during the pandemic. This will also need a reevaluation once the pandemic settles down. Billing should be permanently updated; a new coding system may be useful.",
