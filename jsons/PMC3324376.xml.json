A challenge for government and health agencies is sustaining public awareness and alertness over a protracted period [1,2]. Responding to the challenges posed by managing the risk from relatively unknown health hazards requires recognition of the fact that promoting sustained action involves not only getting the information right but also ensuring that it is communicated in ways that accommodate diversity in community characteristics, needs and expectations. The lack of experience also calls for research to provide the evidence base health authorities need to respond effectively in circumstances (e.g. rapid onset of disease outbreak) that precludes learning in situ.",

It is important to accommodate the fact that disbelief in the effectiveness of measures can result in people failing to act and developing distrust of sources of information [6]. Previous New Zealand research identified a general belief that local agencies will manage a pandemic well and that New Zealand is a relatively safe place to be in the event of a pandemic. However, there was also a lack of trust in information providers as well doubt that the health system would cope [4]. Trust is a crucial component of effective risk communication when people face uncertainty and levels of trust are correlated with people's perceptions of the integrity of information. Lack of trust can be exacerbated by scepticism about the veracity of health risk warnings and the view that media are sensationalist and untrustworthy [7,8]. Being uncertain about an outbreak, and thinking it, and its consequences had been exaggerated have been associated with a lower likelihood of behavioural change [5]. Increasing trust is a function of the degree to which agencies engage with and empower communities [6].",

In contrast to New Zealanders of European descent, M\u0101ori possess different cultural characteristics. For example, based on cultural dimensions [10] M\u0101ori score higher on dimensions such as individualism-collectivism, power distance and uncertainty avoidance compared with their counterparts. Because these differences have significant implications for social influences on behaviour and for the nature of the relationships that exist between community members and health authorities, it was essential to ensure that data were collected in culturally sensitive and competent ways. Hence M\u0101ori were treated differently from the perspective of the data collection approach adopted. This is consistent with effective cross cultural research methods [11].",
