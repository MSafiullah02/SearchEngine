The TP is the proportion of truly infected that is estimated considering the use of imperfect tests [3] . The PFree instead, is the confidence that disease is absent in a population, or if present, it is below a (beforehand) decided hypothetical cut-off prevalence Pu. In other words, the latter represents the cut-off at which the population would be considered as infected, if at least one positive is found out of those tested . The concept of \"freedom\" from disease has already had several applications in the veterinary field [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and more recently, also in public health [11] .",

At a first glance, the application of the proposed principles and protocol (Figs. 1-3) , could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \"starting\" point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities.
