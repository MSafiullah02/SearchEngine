Up to April 3, 2020, 82,857 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Human to human transmission has been confirmed, though initial epidemiological evidence suggested animal to human transmission in patients who had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan 3 . SARS-Cov-2 shows close similarity to bat coronaviruses and belongs to \u03b2-coronavirus genus, but is divergent from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 4 . The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and bilateral distribution of ground glass opacity. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death occur in severe patients.",

At this point, 78 (97.5%) patients had been discharged, one patient had died, and one was still in ICU ( Table 1 ). The median time for hospitalization was 20.5 days. No significant difference was found between NAC and CD groups in treatment and outcome. No significant difference was found between males and females in treatment and outcome. This is the first report of hospitalized frontline medical workers with COVID-19 including 57 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and 23 clinically diagnosed cases. None of these workers visited Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 32-48.5 years), similar with a report from Zhejiang province, China, which showed a median age of 41 years (IQR: 32-52 years) 7 , but different from local study from Wuhan including 138 patients with a median age of 56 years (IQR: 42-68 years). Female patients accounted for the majority (61.25%) of all cases in our study, quite different from other studies 1, 3, 7 . It suggests that the infected frontline medical workers were younger than other patients, and female workers were infected more than male, consistent with the large number of nurses serving in hospital. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, consistent with other studies from Wuhan 3 , while liver disease was the most common comorbidity in Zhejiang province 7 . Wuhan is an inland city and Zhejiang included several coastal cities, whether the difference of comorbidity is caused by the geographic difference is unknown. The most common symptoms were similar with other studies, however, a higher ratio of diarrhea was observed in the frontline medical workers (18.75%) than other patients in Wuhan (10.1%) 3 and Zhejiang province (8%) 7 . The median time from onset to hospital admission was 2 days in Zhejiang province, shorter than that in our study (7 days), which may be caused by urgent alarm of the government from January 23 2020. The NAC group had higher ratio of myalgia but lower ratio of cough and expectoration than the CD group. The clinical features varied between male and female patients. These data indicate that the frontline medical workers showed some unique characteristics.",
