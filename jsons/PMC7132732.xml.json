Our study is a retrospectively observational case control study. A total of 10,429 specimens have taken from children (\u226414 years old) and tested between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2019. In this study, we analyzed IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Sometimes it is not possible to obtain a respiratory sample in some patients, due to his/her age, symptomatology or any special circumstance; in these cases, blood samples are needed for serologic analyses. Health care workers are well trained to obtain blood samples but not all of them are properly trained for obtaining high quality respiratory samples. When a quick and secure transport condition shipment of the respiratory samples cannot be guaranteed, it may be advisable to obtain blood samples rather than respiratory ones. IgG and IgM antibodies show a different behavior during the primoinfections and reinfections. In a primoinfection, IgG and IgM appear in almost all cases (IgM appears earlier than IgG). In reinfections IgM antibodies do not appear in all cases; therefore, IgG detection is the only method that is useful to perform the diagnosis. High titers of IgG can exist in many diseases during the whole patient life, while IgM, generally, only is measurable in sera during 2 or 3 months after the infection, and therefore is an ideal marker of recent infections.",

In the years we investigated from 2014 to 2019, the coinfection combinations containing MP and PIVs, MP and IFVB, IFVB and PIVS, MP and LP all had high detection rates, and the coinfection containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB, IFVB and PIVs.
