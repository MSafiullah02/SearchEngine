A list of 233 eligible hospitals was compiled from the 2005 Canadian Health Facilities Directory. The staff member most responsible for the infection control program was asked to complete the survey. If an infection control program was responsible for multiple hospitals within a larger health organization, aggregated data were accepted if data for individual hospitals were not available. Advertisements in the Canadian Journal of Infection Control and on the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association (CHICA)-Canada Web site (www.chica.org) and memos to CHICA-Canada chapter presidents were used to optimize response, and nonresponders were sent a second survey.",

The survey items that assessed program resources and composed the surveillance and control indices were identical in the 1999 and 2005 versions of the survey. The 23 items in the surveillance index assessed the collection and dissemination of infection data, and the 44 items in the control index measured the activities and policies directed toward the reduction of infections in hospitals. Scores of 100 on the surveillance and control indices indicated that all effective activities were being conducted. Respondents were asked to provide the number of any and all (colonized and infected) new nosocomial cases of MRSA, VRE, and CDAD for 2005 in their hospital. The identical method was used to assess MRSA, VRE, and CDAD rates in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999.2\n",

The MRSA and VRE rates of the present study are in line with the nosocomial MRSA and VRE rates reported for large Canadian teaching hospitals.16, 17 We did not find national or regional increases in nosocomial CDAD between 1999 and 2005. This may have been due to infection control efforts directed toward CDAD that resulted from the numerous deaths associated with outbreaks of the hypervirulent NAP1 strain in Quebec between 2002 and 2004.10 Nevertheless, CDAD rates were higher in Quebec than the rest of Canada in 1999 (t = 3.4, P = .001) and 2005 (t = 4.7, P < .0001).",

However, even with increased ICP staffing, less than one quarter (22.6%) of hospitals had the recommended 1 FTE ICP per 100 beds in 2005.18 The proportion of ICPs with CBIC certification actually decreased from 1999 to 2005. This decrease in certification levels may be due to the requirement for recently hired ICPs to practice in infection control for 2 years with a minimum of 800 hours experience before being eligible to write the CBIC certification examination (www.cbic.org). On average, ICPs had almost 2 years less experience in infection control in 2005 when compared with ICPs in 1999, reflecting recent entrants into the field.",

Increases in ICP staffing and the intensity of control activities in Quebec coincided with the CDAD outbreak in Quebec. Similarly, increases in ICP staffing and the intensity of surveillance activities in Ontario coincided with the SARS outbreak of 2003. Despite these crises-motivated influxes of resources, Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continue to fall short of expert recommendations with respect to the intensity of surveillance and control activities and infection control program human resources.18, 19, 20 Taking into account hypervirulent C difficile strains, the predicted influenza pandemic, and increasing rates of MRSA and VRE, there continues to be great need for ongoing investment in infection control programs.3, 4, 5, 21 If Canada is to achieve widespread control of infections in acute care hospitals, increased investments in infection control human resources are required in the form of more infection control professionals, their training, and certification with CBIC. Infection control programs also require physicians trained in infection control, surveillance tools, and support staff to mount effective control programs and to report on nosocomial infection rates. The size and scope of the ARO problem is increasing, yet there is accumulating evidence that properly designed and executed infection control programs are highly effective and cost beneficial.21 To not continue to make these investments now is very shortsighted and suggests that we may have already forgotten the lessons we were to have learned from the outbreaks of SARS and hypervirulent C difficile.",
