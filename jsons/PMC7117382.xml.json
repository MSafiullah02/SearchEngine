In Europe, PEDV causes gastroenteritis in pigs of all ages with high morbidity but low mortality (Pensaert and DeBouck, 1978, Pensaert et al., 1981, Pritchard et al., 1999), whereas in Asia (Japan, Korea and China) mortality reaches high percentages (30\u201380%) in suckling piglets (Takahashi et al., 1983, Shibata et al., 2001). Three major structural proteins occur in coronaviruses: the glycoprotein S (Mr 150\u2013220 K) found in the viral protrusions (corona), the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N (Mr 45\u201357 K), and the membrane protein M (Mr 20\u201330 K) (Saif, 1993, Utiger et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Conventional diagnostic methods of porcine viral gastroenteritis are based on the detection of either antibodies or the virus. Before local immunity is actively established, the intestine of the piglet is protected against infection by maternal antibodies obtained through colostrum and, later on, mainly through milk. Serological examination allows assessing earlier contacts of sows with the virus, but even litters from seropositive sows are not protected against infection if the milk contains non-protective antibody levels. Therefore, information on a current epizootologic situation in a herd is best obtained by virus detection. Besides virus isolation, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic detection methods are often used (Guscetti et al., 1998, Kim et al., 1999, Rod\u00e1k et al., 1999). As these techniques are labourious and time demanding, only few samples are usually examined. This holds also for highly sensitive and specific methods of molecular virology (PCR, RT-PCR) (Ishikawa et al., 1997, Kweon et al., 1997, Kim et al., 2000), although miniaturization and automation of e.g. real-time PCR methods are gradually reaching the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.",

After centrifugation (2000 \u00d7 \ng for 15 min) of the culture medium, the pellet was resuspended in 1/100 of the original medium volume in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as crude viral antigen (V-Ag). Purified V-Ag was prepared (Hofmann and Wyler, 1990) by ultracentrifugation in saccharose gradients (Beckman, Optima LE-80K Ultracentrifuge, USA) from the supernatant of the infectious culture medium (without cell debris). Similarly, crude control antigens (C-Ag) were prepared from non-infected cell lines. All antigens were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C before use.

The intestinal contents were collected for EM and ELISA virus detection. Small intestine samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at \u221280 \u00b0C before immunohistochemical examination. In the second piglet, diarrhoea occured 48 hpi, and serial faecal samples were collected during one week. Seven weeks post infection, the piglet was orally challenged with 1.1 \u00d7 105 PFU PEDV and sacrificed 12 days later by exsanguination under total anaesthesia. The titre of PEDV antibodies in the obtained serum (SwSpos.) was determined by indirect ELISA (51,200). Good results were obtained by comparative estimation of PEDV blocking activities of this serum and the swine PEDV sera kindly provided by Dr. Pensaert (Belgium) and Dr. M\u00f6stl (Austria). PEDV negative (SwSneg.) swine blood serum was obtained by exsanguination of the 21-day-old uninfected piglet. Both sera were diluted to various extents in the blocking ELISA methods.

Therefore, detection methods are the necessary prerequisite for assessing the current epidemic situation in herds and for subsequent immunoprophylactic measures. Conventional methods (virus isolation, immunohistochemical detection of PEDV) are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, the objective of our study was to assess methods for the detection of viral agents. Blocking ELISA methods of PEDV detection in samples of piglet faeces in the form of double antibody sandwich ELISA) have been used previously. Polyclonal (Callebaut et al., 1982) or monoclonal (Carvajal et al., 1995) binding and detection antibodies, and standard dilution of SwSneg./pos. were employed. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods depended particularly on the quality of the antibodies. High specificity of PEDV detection is obtained particularly by the ELISA method using monoclonal antibodies. However, lower sensitivity of ELISA variants with conjugated mAb was detected in our experiments (Table 1). Therefore after the assessment of three variants, we selected the CB-ELISA based on the use of non-conjugated mAb as optimal. PEDV detection specificity reached by the CB-ELISA method was also proven by the negative results obtained by examinations of crude V-Ag samples of TGEV and rotavirus A (Table 2).",

Also some samples with originally low absorbance but high percentages of blocking were similarly evaluated as positive (Table 2). Determination of viral agents in faecal field samples by EM and blocking ELISA method examinations may be affected by several factors. The time of sample collection after the first symptoms of diarrhoea had emerged and the conditions of shipment are important. High fragility of coronaviruses in the contents of intestines was proven (Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984). Therefore, the finding of the characteristic peplomer structures of coronaviruses by EM is less frequent than the finding of \u201ccorona-like particles\u201d, which are in fact cellular substructures.

A part of the membrane with the LMW standard was stained with colloid gold (lane 1). The other lanes with PEDV were incubated with swine antiserum to PEDV (lane 2), mAbPEDV 3C8/2H6 (lane 4), C2/D5 (lane 5), 2B7 (lane 6), or with diluting solution alone (lanes 3 and 7). After incubation with peroxidase conjugates to swine (lanes 2 and 3) and mouse (lanes 4\u20137) immunoglobulins, the reaction was visualised by incubation in a solution containing the chromogen DAB.",
