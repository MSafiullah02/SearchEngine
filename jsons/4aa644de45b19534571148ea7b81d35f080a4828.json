Many species groups and unplaced species of heroines are still left without a generic name following the revision of the genus Cichlasoma. We describe here the \u00d4Cichlasoma' facetum group as a new genus, Australoheros, and provide evidence for its monophyly based on phylogenetic analyses of morphological and mtDNA characters. Australoheros is morphologically characterized by the lowest values in meristic characters among heroines and by three apomorphic characters in coloration pattern. In addition to the three described species of Australoheros, our results of species delimitation based on a combination of tree-and character-based approaches identify seven putatively new species of Australoheros. Several coding schemes of morphological characters are used to recover the intrageneric relationships within the genus, resulting in very similar topologies. Discovery of additional species within the genus is expected once material from the whole distribution area is studied.",

            "text": "Cichlasoma facetum is the oldest Neotropical aquarium fish, first brought alive to Europe in 1889 and bred for the first time in captivity before the end of the 19th century (Bade 1897 ). The first specimens described as Chromis facetus Jenyns, 1842, were collected in coastal Uruguay during the famous voyage of Charles Darwin. Chromys oblonga de Castelnau, 1855, Heros autochton Gu\u00a8nther, 1862 , H. jenynsii Steindachner, 1869 , and H. acaroides Hensel, 1870 are treated as synonyms to C. facetus, known as C. facetum for most of the 20th century. More than two decades ago, Kullander (1983) restricted Cichlasoma to only 12 South American species, most of them described in that revision, and the species is since then referred to as \u00d4Cichlasoma' facetum (Jenyns, 1842) . The genus level taxonomy and also phylogenetic relationships of Mesoamerican heroines are poorly understood, and after the restriction of Cichlasoma, more than eight species groups including >20 species are without any applicable generic name. In view of the difficulty of a prompt comprehensive analysis of Cichlasoma sensu lato, Kullander (1996) suggested the provisional use of available generic names, an advice that other workers had already widely adopted, in spite of the earlier opinion by Kullander himself (1983) , Stiassny (1991) , and Miller (1993) , that \u00d4Cichlasoma'with the quotation marks indicating its informality -should be used for species for which no generic name was applicable. To date, no study has been undertaken to demonstrate monophyletic status of any of those groups. To make the situation even more complicated, new genera are being described for some of the most complex groups (e.g. Allgayer 2001) , ignoring results of studies not in agreement (Martin and Bermingham 1998) and without any phylogenetic analysis demonstrating monophyly.",

            "text": "The question of how to recognize species is a heated topic (see e.g. Wheeler and Meier 2000) . There is an immense literature concerning what species are and how they are to be discovered. We share the notion of de Queiroz (1998) , who suggested that, despite the long history of dispute over species concepts, most species concepts agree fundamentally that species are lineages (Simpson 1961; Wiley 1978; Cracraft 1983; de Queiroz and Donoghue 1988; Frost and Kluge 1994; Baum and Shaw 1995) . What previous authors have generally disagreed about are the best criteria for recognizing these lineages (de Queiroz 1998) . This trend is particularly apparent when the meager literature on the methodology of species delimitation is contrasted with the extensive body of work on the theory and methods of phylogenetic analysis. Several species criteria or methods for species delimitation have been proposed (e.g. Avise and Ball 1990; Davis and Nixon 1992; Baum and Donoghue 1995; Mallet 1995; Brower 1999; Wiens 1999; Wiens and Servedio 2000; Puorto et al. 2001; Templeton 2001; Wiens and Penkrot 2002) , but empirical taxonomists rarely state their criteria for species delimitation explicitly. In this work, we use character-based and tree-based approaches to analyse morphological characters as two tests of species delimitation.",

Thiele's implementation of GW involves finding, for a given character, the mean value of the trait in each species in the analysis, the range of mean species values among taxa (i.e. the species with the greatest mean value and the species with the lowest), and then dividing this range into smaller ranges or segments equal to the maximum number of character states allowed by the phylogenetic software program (e.g. 32 for paup*). We have used a less fine grained spacing, thus having in most cases <32 states. Species are then assigned states based on these ranges, and the character is ordered. Evolving from low to high mean trait values (or vice versa) therefore requires passing through many intermediate states and requires many steps, whereas smaller changes in trait values involve fewer state changes and fewer steps. An important advantage of the gap-weighting method is that it incorporates information on the distance between states, weighting the changes according to the difference between mean species values.",

The SMGW method assigns to each taxon for a given character a unique mean trait value, and the costs of changes between these states are specified with a step matrix, based on the difference in mean trait values between each pair of species. The analyses are constrained by the number of distinct states allowed by the computer software package (>32 for paup or paup*), which does not allow analyses of large numbers of taxa with unique trait means. If the number of taxa with unique means is too large, the gap-weighting method of Thiele (1993) , or it's modification as used here is the best approximation. These methods use less-fine-grained information, but have no limits on the number of taxa that can be coded.",

The sequenced specimens are mainly from aquarium stocks, except some of the Australoheros sequences (Table 1) . DNA was extracted from small pieces of muscle or gill (10-25 mg) using the Dneasy TM Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The entire cyt b gene (1.3 kb) was PCR amplified with primers GLuDG.L-TGA CTT GAA RAA CCA YCG TTG (Palumbi et al. 1991 ) and H15915-AAC TGC CAG TCA TCT CCG GGT TAC AAG AC (Irwin et al. 1991) . PCR reactions were carried out with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, primer annealing at 45-50\u00b0C for 40 s and primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. PCR was finished by final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by ethanol precipitation or using Microcon PCR Filter Units (Millipore) and directly sequenced on an automated DNA sequencer using BigDye TM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v.3.1 (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reaction products were cleaned by ethanol precipitation or with DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen) were resolved on ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser (Perkin Elmer). Except the amplification primers, the following additional primers were used for sequencing: modified L14952 of Lydeard et al. (1995;  TCA TCC GTC GCC CAC AT), modified L15162 of Taberlet et al. (1992; CCA TGA GGA CAA ATA TC), and L15299 (Lydeard and Roe 1997) . Chromatograms were assembled and checked by eye for potential mistakes using SeqMan II of the DNAStar software package (http://www. dnastar.com). Edited sequences were aligned using the default settings in ClustalX software (Thompson et al. 1997) . The alignment was manually revised in BioEdit (Biological sequence alignment editor v5.0.9, http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/ bioedit.html). The alignment includes no gaps.",

A priory, based on possession of unique character states and unique combinations of character states, we have hypothesized that 10 species can be recognized within Australoheros. Two species (A. scitulus and A. sp. forquilha) posses unique characters, the remaining species are diagnosed by unique combinations of characters. The recognition of these 10 species is supported by the results of the characters-based species delimitation using multivariate analysis of meristic and morphometric data. The results of the tree-based species delimitation, utilizing also colour pattern characters, support the recognition of all these species but one (A. sp. forquilha), which is represented by two lineages in the tree-based delimitation (Fig. 8a) . The populations from the upper R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay tributaries in the Brazilian states of R\u0131\u00b4o Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina cluster separately from those around the town of Soberbio in the Argentinean province Misiones (A. sp. forquilha vs. A. cf. sp. forquilha; Figs 8a, 10) . The situation is complex because of the bad condition of the material from Misiones, for which coloration characters diagnostic for A. sp. forquilha cannot be scored. The material from Misiones is slightly different in a number of meristic characters, but the specimens do posses the diagnostic shortest interorbital and longest preorbital distances of A. sp. forquilha. Australoheros tembe (Casciotta et al. 1995) is to date the only described species of Australoheros from Misiones (Argentina), and all material comes from tributaries of the Arroyo Urugua-\u0131\u00b4and its tributaries, which form an affluent of R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4. A single specimen referred to as \u00d4Cichlasoma' sp. tembe is known from Arroyo Fortaleza (Casciotta et al. 2003) , which is a tributary of R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. Arroyo Fortaleza is very close to Soberbio, and this specimen is likely to be A. cf. sp. forquilha rather than A. tembe.",

The lots from Soberbio in Misiones were actually all a mix of A. sp. forquilha and A. sp. jacutinga. While in the case of A. sp. forquilha the Soberbio samples form a separate lineage in the tree-based analyses, this is not the case with the A. sp. jacutinga samples. The four populations of A. sp. jacutinga do form one monophyletic lineage in the phylogenetic analysis of populations using the GW method (Fig. 8a) . In the phylogenetic analysis using the SMGW method the Iguac\u00b8u population is found outside the cluster of the three other A. sp. jacutinga populations, but still in very close proximity, as the sister group of the A. sp. pirapo-A. scitulus clade (Fig. 8a) . The position of the Iguac\u00b8u population is probably changing because of considerable amount of missing data entries (few specimens available). The result of the GW analysis is in agreement with the character-based delimitation, and we prefer to treat all the four populations as representing one species only, i.e. A. sp. jacutinga. The Iguac\u00b8u population has an interesting distribution, as the R\u0131\u00b4o Iguac\u00b8u tributaries are connected with R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, but not with R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay, where all other samples of A. sp. jacutinga come from.",

            "text": "Cyt b data are available only for five species, but they show significant sequence divergences (>4%) between the species, supporting the recognition of these species based on morphological characters. Several heroine species are separated by much smaller divergences in the cyt b gene (e.g. Astatheros alfari and A. bussingi at 2.5%; Loiselle 1997; Martin and Bermingham 1998) . Given the relatively slow rate of nucleotide substitution in fish mitochondrial DNA relative to \u00d4conventional' rate estimates for vertebrates (Bermingham et al. 1997) , these levels of sequence differen- tiation within species are remarkable and suggest an isolation of several millions of years. The morphological distinctiveness of the species for which DNA was available and those for which it was not is similar, suggesting that also molecular divergences of these species will be significant. While both morphological as well as cyt b data agree that Australoheros includes more species than generally assumed, the relationships between the species are in disagreement depending on the type of characters used (morphology vs. mtDNA). The extent of the conflict is difficult to assess under the unbalanced taxon sampling, but the disagreements cannot be attributed to different rooting position only. In order to test this conflict, we performed a combined analysis of the two data sets with a reduced taxon sampling. This analysis resulted in a topology identical to that based on cyt b only (results not shown; see Fig. 1 ). The differences between the cyt b and the morphological topologies are statistically significant (tested with the compare-2 test in paup*; MP topology of the combined data forced to morphological topology p \u00bc 0.045; morphological topology forced to the cyt b data set p \u00bc 0.013). Two nodes (shown by asterisks in Fig. 1) show strong conflict between the two data sets as judged from the partitioned bremer support (results not shown). The most notable difference is that the best recognizable species (A. scitulus) is placed in the cyt b tree as the sister group of all other species and not as a close relative of A. sp. jacutinga, and A. tembe is not placed as a basal species. Contrary to the morphological hypothesis, the highest observed sequence divergence is between A. scitulus and A. sp. jacutinga (7.0%). Morphological cladograms show A. sp. uruguai as the sister group of A. facetus plus A. cf. facetus, but the cyt b tree supports A. sp. uruguai as being most closely related to A. sp. jacutinga. The sister group relationship between A. sp. uruguai and A. sp. jacutinga can be supported from the morphological data by the low number of pectoral fin rays uniquely shared by the two species and the sister group relationship is also supported by the partitioned bremer analysis, where both partitions agree in the combined topology. A. sp. uruguai and A. sp. jacutinga also replace each other along the middle R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay.",

            "text": "Four of the hypothesized species come from the Brazilian portion of the middle-upper R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. The R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay is known to contain surprisingly many species of fishes for the size of the area. We are not aware of any phylogenetic study published which would include fish faunas of the R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay, but there are several faunal listings and taxonomic papers dealing with the area. The faunistic studies of Bertoletti et al. (1989a Bertoletti et al. ( ,b, 1990 R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. Whether the difference in species composition between the upper and middle R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay is through a gradual or abrupt shift is not known. Lucena and Kullander (1992) recognized eleven Crenicichla species in the Brazilian portion of the R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay drainage. No monophyletic groups have been presented, but the authors hypothesize two species groups and several additional species with an uncertain position. Five species were included in the missioneira group, and the group should be endemic to the middle and upper R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. Four Australoheros species delimited here, A. sp. forquilha, A. sp. jacutinga, A. sp. pirapo, and A. sp. uruguai seem to be endemic to the same area as the missioneira group of Crenicichla. A partial exception is A. sp. uruguai, as the southernmost record is from the middle/lower R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay in Uruguay (collection of T. Litz, cat. no. 495) . Whether known records of A. facetus from lower/middle Uruguay are actually all A. sp. uruguai or if the two species occur in sympatry remains to be examined. Contrary to the missioneira group of Crenicichla, the four Australoheros species do not form a monophyletic group in neither of our analyses, at least A. sp. forquilha does not seem to be related to the remaining three species, and A. sp. pirapo is clearly the sister species of A. scitulus. The middle-lower R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay hosts three Australoheros species, A. facetus, A. scitulus and probably A. sp. uruguai. In the case of Crenicichla, the middle-lower R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay also hosts three species, C. scottii, Crenicichla lepidota, and Crenicichla vittata. Crenicichla lepidota and C. vittata are widespread Paraguayan/La Plata species, occurring also in the lower-middle R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay, most likely paralleling the distribution of A. facetus. Crenicichla scottii was placed with Crenicichla gaucho and Crenicichla prenda in the scottii group. If this group is indeed monophyletic, and if A. sp. jacutinga is the sister group of A. sp. pirapo and A. scitulus, these two groups would have the same distribution pattern, crossing the hypothesized boundary between upper and middle-lower R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. The cladograms suggest that the coastal areas of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil were colonized by two different lineages (the A. scitulus and A. facetus groups), probably from the area of the middle R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay. There are several other cited areas of endemism and biogeographical patterns in the La Plata region (Lucena and Kullander 1992) , one of them being the distinction between the species in R\u0131\u00b4o Uruguay drainages and those in the Atlantic drainages of Uruguay and Southern Brazil. This distinction holds true for Crenicichla (Lucena and Kullander 1992) and also for Australoheros.",
