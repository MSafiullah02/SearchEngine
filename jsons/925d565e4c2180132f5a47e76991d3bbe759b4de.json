ILI symptoms were reported by 41.0% of total pilgrims. An increase of respiratory symptoms was observed twice, following the Tawaf, which is performed in the Grand Mosque in Mecca in highly overcrowded conditions. An 8-fold increase in the overall prevalence of respiratory viruses was observed between samples obtained before departing from France (4.8% of pilgrims) and samples obtained from ill pilgrims after performing their first Tawaf in Mecca (38.6% of pilgrims). In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected from symptomatic pilgrims (27%). This result is in accordance with studies conducted worldwide where HRV has been recognized as the most frequent virus responsible for the common cold in adults [26, 27] . This is not unexpected, as rhinoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are more resistant in the environment than enveloped viruses. Symptoms of HRV infection are generally mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, lower respiratory symptoms associated with HRV infection are prominent in patients who have underlying asthma or other chronic lung disease [28] . In the present study, 7.8% of pilgrims reported chronic respiratory diseases; therefore, prevention must be reinforced in this high-risk population. There have been arguments [26] regarding whether rhinoviruses are spread chiefly from infected person to healthy individuals by direct contact to the fingers of healthy individuals by a handshake or indirect contact from the hands of an infected person to an intermediary surface [29] , or through the aerosol route [30] . Our findings showed that more frequent hand-washing was significantly associated with feverishness and symptoms of ILI and with a higher prevalence of respiratory viruses. However, these results may indicate a reverse causation, as pilgrims with symptoms or who believe themselves to be at greater risk may have washed their hands more frequently. A recent study found that hand disinfection did not reduce HRV infection or HRV-related common cold illnesses [31] . The prevalence of HRV paralleled the increase of respiratory clinical symptoms, with a higher prevalence in pilgrims sampled in Mecca City during the first week of the pilgrimage.

Second, symptom occurrence was collected retrospectively and was based on self-reporting; thus, the date of the medical consultation did not necessarily correspond to the selfreported date of the onset of respiratory symptoms. Third, samples that were obtained at the beginning of the pilgrimage in the KSA were stored at room temperature (20\u00b0C) for periods up to 30 days before being processed, which may have been resulted in the degradation of genetic material. This may have likely contributed to underestimating the frequencies of infection.

Fourth, a technical point is that HRV sequencing was not performed to determine how often new HRV infections were acquired during the stay in the KSA.
