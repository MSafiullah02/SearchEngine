            "text": "Non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) are responsible for a substantial proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI), and pneumonia [1, 2], although epidemiological data on their burden are scarce. The pathogenicity of viruses recently discovered, such as human metapneumovirus in 2001, or bocavirus in 2005 [3, 4], remains poorly characterized. Even NIRV discovered earlier (e.g. parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenovirus) have attracted limited clinical interest thus far, as a result of the absence of rapid tests routinely available, and the lack of vaccine or antiviral treatment with proven clinical efficacy [1, 2, 5, 6]. The advent of highly sensitive and specific point-of-care tests for simultaneous detection of the main respiratory viruses is an opportunity to investigate the role of NIRV in common acute respiratory febrile illness, including the risk factors for, and the characteristics of, NIRV-associated ILI. These data may have important implications, including (1) screening and early implementation of respiratory isolation for patients with NIRV to prevent nosocomial transmission; (2) identification of the major NIRV that should be targeted for development of antivirals or vaccines. We aimed to determine the characteristics of, and the risk factors for NIRV among adults admitted with ILI during influenza seasons in France.",

FLUVAC is a prospective observational study of influenza vaccine efficacy conducted in six university hospitals in France (Cochin Hospital, Paris; Bichat Hospital, Paris; Pontchaillou Hospital, Rennes; Dupuytren Hospital, Limoges; Montpellier University Hospital; Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon). Patients were invited to participate during periods of influenza circulation (from December to March). We collected data on non-institutionalized adults (> 18 years), who were hospitalized for at least 24 h with ILI, with symptoms onset less than 7 days prior to sampling, through an active surveillance system staffed by trained healthcare professionals. ILI was defined as a combination of two criteria: (1) at least one of the following symptoms: fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0C), headache, myalgia or malaise, and (2) at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath (dyspnea) [7]. The characteristics and outcome of patients with influenza [8, 9] and RSV [10] in this cohort have been previously reported.",

The Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used, as appropriate, for univariable comparisons. For multivariable analysis, we used a backward stepwise logistic regression model, using NIRV test results (positive/negative) as the dependent variable. Covariables tested in the multivariable model were all variables with a P value < 0.2 in the univariable analysis. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.

For the latter, experimental studies suggested that NIRV may trigger acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) [16\u201318]. Interestingly, chronic respiratory diseases remained associated with NIRV in our study, even when the comparison group was patients with influenza, and even in multivariable analysis. This suggests a specific pathogenicity of NIRV in this population, that may be more prone to decompensate during NIRV infection than during influenza. Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs was also associated with NIRV in our study, whatever the comparison group, but the association was no longer significant on multivariable analysis, which suggests that confounding factors are involved. The lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with NIRV, as compared to patients with influenza, and to patients with no respiratory virus, in our study, was not expected. Diabetes has been associated with a broad range of infectious diseases [19, 20], including upper respiratory tract infection in some studies [19], but not all [21]. Although the lower prevalence of diabetes in patients with NIRV as compared to patients with influenza could be related to stronger association between diabetes and influenza than between diabetes and NIRV, we have no explanation for the lower prevalence of diabetes in patients with NIRV as compared to patients with no respiratory virus.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations. First, we have no data to support causality between the presence of NIRV in upper respiratory samples and the ILI that required admission. Other pathogens may be involved (e.g. bacteria), and NIRV may merely be a bystander infectious agent with no role in the symptoms reported. The lack of a control population with no respiratory symptoms is another limitation that precludes any conclusion on the pathogenicity of NIRV. Second, we only performed systematic tests for influenza, and a selection of NIRVs, although other pathogens have been associated with acute respiratory infections [22]. Third, our study was limited to influenza seasons, in one country, and its findings may not apply to other settings. However, our study has strengths, including its prospective, multicenter design, and the standardization of viral tests for all adult patients admitted with predefined ILI, during three consecutive influenza seasons. These strengths, and the limited number of missing data, reduce the risk of potential biases. Our study adds another brick in the wall by contributing to better characterization of the burden of NIRV in adult patients with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections. The identification of transmissible, NIRV, in 15% of adult patients admitted with ILI would advocate for more systematic testing of these patients, especially those with chronic respiratory diseases. This would allow early respiratory isolation, as to prevent nosocomial transmission of NIRV, which may have severe consequences on patients with chronic respiratory diseases and patients on immunosuppressive drugs.",
