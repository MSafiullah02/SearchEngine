[6] [7] [8] Despite these clinical observations, there has been relatively little clinicopathologic correlation with the post-mortem findings in COVID-19 which to date have generally focused on the pulmonary histology of diffuse alveolar damage. [9] [10] [11] [12] Herein we report the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 associated HLH diagnosed post-mortem using histologic, clinical and laboratory criteria.",

Detailed pathologic studies of bone marrow biopsies in this regard have shown that nucleated cell phagocytosis as well as multiply phagocytosed nucleated cells within single macrophages have higher specificity for the diagnosis of HLH than erythrophagocytosis alone. 25 Our observation of a high density of macrophages engulfing multiple lymphocytes thus warrants greater consideration than erythrophagocytosis which is observed in a variety of disease states.",

Slides were visualized with Optiview detection (Ventana, 760-700). Internal and external controls were examined for each slide and judged satisfactory before interpretation. As controls, spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes from archived autopsies of five patients with non-COVID-19 related ARDS performed between 2007-2019 were stained with CD163.

Patient 3 had focal subcapsular hemophagocytosis in a mediastinal lymph node but did not exhibit clinical criteria of HLH with an H-score of 131. Patient 4, who did not show hemophagocytosis in any reticuloendothelial organ, had the lowest H-score of 96. Of note, no patient in our series exhibited hypofibrinogenemia or bicytopenia/pancytopenia. Figure 4 shows the rate of ferritin rise in each of the four patients. Patient 1 and 2 with definite and probable HLH exhibited in ferritin levels beginning early in the disease course. Ferritin levels were low throughout most of the disease course of patient 3 and 4 although both received sarilumab early in admission.
