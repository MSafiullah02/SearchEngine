The SIV causes an acute respiratory disease and is transmissible to humans causing high fever, lethargy, nasal discharge, coughing, and dyspnea (Choi et al., 2002). The pandemic influenza A is transmitted from person to person by exposure to infected secretions. Conventional methods of virus diagnosis including virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) require extensive sample handling, laboratory infrastructure, and long sample-to-result time (Lee et al., 1993). Although the reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated the lowest detection limit of less than 0.1 TCID50/ml for SIV (Lekcharoensuk et al., 2006), it was offset by the need for sophisticated bench-top instrumentation, tedious and time-consuming sample preparation, and inclusion of trained personnel. Furthermore, the amount of sample available is often very small e.g., blood and cerebrospinal fluid from a neonate. Hence, it is desirable to develop a simple, sensitive, reliable and inexpensive antigen detection technique.",

They play the role of direct monitoring of molecular recognition event and consequently the diagnosis of pathogens. A variety of immunosensors has been developed using different transducers that exploit changes in mass (Vaughan et al., 2001), heat (Pizziconi and Page, 1997), electrochemical (Plekhanova et al., 2003, Sadik and Van Emon, 1996, Sklaal, 1997), or optical properties (Duendorfer and Kunz, 1998, Kubitschko et al., 1997, Marks et al., 2000). Of various transduction mechanisms, the electric detection of viruses (Dastagir et al., 2007, Mannoor et al., 2010, Nebling et al., 2003) has a potential to revolutionize traditional laboratory assays for pathogen detection, since it can be implemented easily overcoming disadvantages of the traditional assay. The portable personal devices including electrometer unit can be used to measure electrical signals from the assay. It is advantageous to point-of-care detection application in that other transduction mechanisms need the expensive and sophisticated instruments to measure output signal. For example, expensive quartz crystals and precise optical gears should be used in quartz crystal microbalance and surface plasmon resonance, respectively.",

In addition, CNTs enable a better biotic\u2013abiotic interface due to their size similarity and the immobilized biomolecules preserve their bioactivities such as enzymatic reactions and recognition functions (Rica et al., 2008). The unique electrochemical transduction functions found previously (Lee and Cui, 2009b, Lee and Cui, 2010) sustain the application of CNTs to biosensing toward the label-free detection.

It showed discrete conductance change upon binding/unbinding of virus to the accepter molecules immobilized on nanowire. Furthermore, metal oxide nanowires were used to detect biomarker N-protein for severe acute respiratory syndrome virus using antibody mimic proteins resulting in sensitivity of sub-nanomolar concentration (Ishikawa et al., 2009). Hepatitis C virus RNA was electrically detected in the range of pico-molar concentration via SWCNT field effect transistors (Duendorfer and Kunz, 1998). Anti-hemagglutinin was detected through immune-reaction on the back-gate SWCNT transistor where hemagglutinin was immobilized. The detection limit of 5 \u00d7 10\u22128\n mg/ml was found, which was three orders lower magnitude than the conventional ELISA technique. Influenza virus hemagglutinin could be a target molecule by immobilizing anti-hemagglutinin on the CNT FET surface (Takeda et al., 2007).",

The resistance shifts upon virus binding were normalized with the resistance of bare devices, which extended the detection range with decreasing the channel length of CNT resisters. The CNTs networks were able to successfully detect as low as 180 TCID50/ml of SIV using normalized resistance shift upon immunobinding of viruses. The sensor selectivity was shown against non-SIV viruses e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline calicivirus (FCV).

Furthermore, CNTs themselves have a strong affinity for biomolecules by means of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It is not yet clear if covalent conjugation through carbodiimide cross linker is differentiated by electrostatic physical adsorption (Gao and Kyratzis, 2008).

Chromium (Cr, 300 \u00c5) and gold (Au, 1000 \u00c5) were electron-beam evaporated onto the Si/SiO2 substrate and patterned for two electrodes using photolithography.

After the development of photoresist, oxygen (O2) plasma was used to remove the residual photoresist completely on the opening window at a power of 100 W for 1 min with O2 flow rate of 100 sccm as well as to make the surface hydrophilic, which is beneficial to the subsequent LbL assembly. The SWCNT multilayer thin film was assembled between microfabricated electrodes as a resistor. For thin film construction, two bi-layers of (PDDA/PSS) were firstly self-assembled as a precursor layer on the patterned substrate for the charge enhancement followed by the assembly of (PDDA/SWCNT)5 as an electrochemical transducing material.

The measured resistances of bare, PLL coated, and anti-SIV antibody assembled chips are shown with the standard error as error bars in Fig. 3(b). The resistance increases significantly upon PLL assembly presumably due to the drastically decreased charge carrier transfer caused by surface adsorption. However, it should be noted that antibody assembly on PLL layer does not influence resistance apparently as much as PLL does on SWCNTs. Once PLL is adsorbed on the sensitive CNT surface, there must be a significant electrostatic and/or structural change to induce observable resistance change. This suggests that the resistance changes after immunobinding of SIVs due to their charge carrier donating/accepting property and/or huge structure compared to SWCNT and antibody. The physical adsorption of viruses influences the electrical properties of SWCNT thin film which, in general, increases resistivity.",

The higher the SIV concentration, the more SIV adsorbs on the surface resulting in increased resistance of SWCNT film. Immunochips with 10 \u03bcm channel length exhibit a resolution down to 104-fold dilution, but the saturated resistance change at high concentrations from undiluted to 102-fold dilution is observed. On the other hand, the plateau at high concentration is not observed in immunochips with 20 and 50 \u03bcm channel lengths. However, it is noted that those devices show a resolution at 103-fold dilution. The reason for the significant deviation at lower concentration and control immunochips with 20 and 50 \u03bcm channel lengths is that open binding sites in anti-SIV antibodies over the large area might be susceptible to other molecules present in a virus solution, causing unstable resistance shift. This indicates that the sensing area plays an important role in controlling the detection range and limit of detection. The larger sensing area can detect a higher concentration, yielding a lower resolution, which further suggests the use of nanoscale conducting gap or nanoscale individual materials could yield higher resolution. It is noticeable that the sensitivity of 30\u201340 \u03a9/decade is observed on each detection range irrespective of the sensing area.",

The average and standard error were extracted from 5 sets of immunoassay. The amount of virus bound corresponds to the resistance shift, and it is dependent on the amount of antibody as well. The immobilized antibody is proportional to effective binding area on PLL, ultimately on SWCNT film. For this reason, variation in amount of SWCNT, PLL, and antibody is resolved by normalization. Once the resistance shifts were normalized with the resistances of bare chips (R\nchip), the sensitivity is about 7.3%/decade on the range of undiluted sample to 103-fold dilutions. However, the sensitivities upon normalization with the resistances after PLL (R\nPLL) and antibody adsorption (R\nAb) were almost the same, which is about 5.9%/decade on 101- to 103-fold dilutions. Moreover, the discernible signal was obtained on the saturated region, undiluted to 102-fold dilution when only resistance shift was considered in Fig. 4.

As a result of selectivity test, the detection of SIV is selective down to 103-fold dilution (1.77 \u00d7 102\n TCID50/ml). The range of influenza viral particles 103\u2013105 TCID50/ml has been found in the infected swine nasal samples (Reichmuth et al., 2008).
