            "text": "-Message from the IACAPAP President and Executive Committee, April 15, 2020 The first human cases of Covid-19 were identified in December 2019 [1] . Since then, the virus has spread around the world and, by March 2020, most European countries as well as the US had started to report sharp increases in the number of cases [2] . As we write this editorial in late April, more than 2 million people have been infected around the globe and over 140,000 people have died [3] . Worldwide, researchers are on the hunt for a vaccine, but initial results are not expected for several months. Meanwhile, the fight against the virus continues with strategies to mitigate its consequences and to protect high-risk groups in the population. In general, measures of hygiene and distancing strategies now being used in most countries are aimed at slowing down the infection rate-at flattening the curve in order to avoid the collapse of overwhelmed health care systems. We prefer the term 'physical distancing' over the commonly used 'social distancing' . We are not the only ones [4] , and our rationale is evident: we are social beings, and social connection is as necessary to our physiology as is nourishment. Many of us are fortunate to maintain physical distance or complete isolation while remaining virtually connected. But many across the globe don't have access to the internet or to electronic devices through which to communicate with each other. We don't take for granted the e-means through which we are spreading this message and reaching our community of peers. There remains much to be done to make virtual connections available for all, and especially for those in highest need. Indeed, virtual connectivity and the challenge to reach communities in need are at the core of our message-and of our entreaty to readers.",

Retired doctors and nurses have returned to service and students of medical and nursing schools have volunteered in 'drivethrough' corona testing stations. Students help out on the wards or at specific medical facilities to ensure basic care for all patients [5] . Some medical and nursing schools have graduated their seniors months ahead of schedule in order to meet the overwhelming demand for health care providers. As the medical system understandably prioritizes care for the sickest patients and those at imminent risk of death, other areas, including the mental health sector, have received less focused attention [6] . Some forms of high-risk treatment, like day treatment units in child and adolescent psychiatry have closed, as have schools and aftercare programs. Strategies such as telehealth have increased rapidly, and mental health professionals have become creative in order to continue serving their patients. The pandemic has accelerated uptake of telepsychiatry in ways that early adopters of virtual strategies could not have dreamed of. Paradoxically, the pandemic has been a blessing for telepsychiatry-and may not be the only silver lining to an otherwise sobering public health crisis.",

Most institutions have installed pre-screenings to adequately triage health concerns and minimize contact risk at physical locations as much as possible. Inpatient treatment has been maintained in most places, although with major changes to usual practices (as but one example, 'milieu-based' services that are core to many inpatient units are challenging, though not impossible, to conduct under physical distancing). Screening and quarantine conditions have been instituted for patients in urgent need of inpatient care, but universal testing is not yet available in most countries, further compounding the challenges to admit children into congregate care settings. Visits to the wards have been massively limited or entirely eliminated, distancing rules maintained by staff wearing masks and other personal protection equipment. Overall, the nature of care and the human contact at its center have all changed dramatically and at dizzying speed. Adaptation and flexibility have become the name of the game.",

Families are forced to re-organize and cope with new situations, such as quarantine and physical distancing. School closures have led to distance-learning and home-schooling-not to mention challenges to food distribution: school is the place where many children around the globe get a consistent daily caloric intake. School-based nutrition is a reality in both developing and developed countries [7] [8] [9] . Parents are experiencing increased pressure to work from home, to keep jobs and businesses running, as well as to support, educate and comfort their children at the same time. Many families don't have the ability to isolate or restrict physically, with economic realities superseding public health prevention efforts. Additionally, parents have the role of explaining the pandemic and its consequences to their children, and to manage and contain the fear and anxiety that accompanies everyone in the family during these uncertain times. Under this panoply of acute adversity, children may be at higher risk than in normal times for abuse or neglect, and with protective care agencies also working under extreme and strained conditions, recognition and intervention may be delayed.",

We anticipate the current crisis will have a similar impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. In a recent review, Brook and colleagues [11] examined the psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce its accompanying negative psychological effects, including posttraumatic stress, confusion and anger. Boredom and frustration may predict family stress and conflicts. The uncertain duration of the quarantine measures, the need for families to simultaneously work (or manage the stressors of employment loss), to provide childcare and to support distance-learning efforts, as well as to manage the impact of disease and loss of life in their families and communities may lead to long-lasting effects, many of them related to mental health and psychopathology.",

There is reason for concern that suicide rates may increase during the crisis as a consequence of distancing, quarantine and isolation [12] . Additionally, there is evidence from the major economic recession of the last decade that child maltreatment and intimate partner violence increases during such periods [13] [14] [15] . The omnipresent reports about death rates and people dying without relatives able to say goodbye evoke additional health-related fears that will affect persons in different ways.

We are especially interested in empirical work on clinical service delivery or educational initiatives, and in any work that offers international collaborations or innovative solutions. We welcome submissions of a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods nature. Our aim is to produce a curated issue of open-access resources available free of charge to our global readership. We encourage inquiries on potential submissions, and interested readers can submit their queries to the special issue section editors by contacting the corresponding author. We are partnering in this effort with the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professionals (IACAPAP), one of our parent organizations.
