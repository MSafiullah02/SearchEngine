            "text": "Several sentinel surveillance networks have been established because of the concern about the possibility of a pandemic outbreak caused by a virulent new influenza virus and its implications for humans and the global economic and financial system. The Asturian Sentinel Surveillance Network (ASSN), which comprises primary care health units (PCHU) throughout the region, has been organized to detect and monitor the mergence of influenza virus outbreaks each year. This surveillance system detects the onset of influenza epidemics and identifies specific strains each season. Although the main role of ASSN, which is included in the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS), is the study of influenza outbreaks, such network could also be used as a virological surveillance system for other community-acquired viral infections. The importance of similar networks was shown after the emergence of the new influenza virus IAn/H1N1, which was first reported in Mexico during April 2009 and rapidly detected in many other countries. Thus, >600,000 cases and >14,000 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization during 2009. As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that the majority of IAn/H1N1 infections are mild and indistinguishable from any other seasonal influenza virus infection.1 Nevertheless, there are few data about the comparison of the clinical features of infection with IAn/H1N1 and with other respiratory viruses.",

The first round of amplification was carried out using specific outer primers (Table 1) according to the instructions provided with the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche, Germany). To increase sensitivity, a second round of amplification was carried out using specific inner primers (Table 1\n) and Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL) in PCR buffer (1\u00d7) supplied by the manufacturer. The annealing temperature of both amplifications was 55 \u00b0C. The PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose-TBE gel electrophoresis. The expected amplicon sizes analyzed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis are described in Table 1.",
