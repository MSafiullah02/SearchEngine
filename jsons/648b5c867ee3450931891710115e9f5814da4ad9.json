            "text": "The coronavirus strain HECV-4408 was isolated from diarrhea fluid of a 6-year-old child with acute diarrhea and propagated in human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cells. Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus particles in the diarrhea fluid sample and the infected HRT-18 cell cultures. This virus possessed hemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities and caused cytopathic effects in HRT-18 cells but not in MDBK, GBK and FE cells. One of four S-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted in Western blots with HECV-4408, BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138 but not with HCV-OC43, and two reacted with BCV-L9 but not with HECV-4408, BCV-LY138 and HCV-OC43. One S-specific and two N-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains. cDNA encompassing the 3' 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV-OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV-4408 and BCV. A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the nonstructural genes of HCV-OC43 was not detected in HECV-4408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV-4408 and the virulent wild-type BCV. Forty-nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV-4408 and HCV-OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV-4408 and BCV-LY138. We thus conclude that the strain HECV-4408 is a hemagglutinating enteric coronavirus that is biologically, antigenically and genomically more closely related to the virulent BCV-LY138 than t o HCV-OC43.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are important causes of gastroenteritis in animals, but their involvement in human enteric diseases remains enigmatic with evidence limited to electron microscopic detection of coronavirus-like particles in stool samples obtained from patients with acute gastroenteritis or necrotizing enterocolitis. Attempts to propagate these viruses in cell cultures remained futile while immunological studies indicated that they are coronaviruses [Kidd et al., 1989; Marshall et al., 1989; Singh et al., 1989; Battaglia et al., 1987;  peritonitis virus (FIPV), and canine coronavirus (CCV) belong to another antigenic cluster Dea et al., 19901 . The two human coronaviruses OC43 and 2293 were associated with the respiratory disorders resembling the common cold [Hamre et al., 1967; McIntosch et al., 19711. Coronauiridae comprise enveloped viruses with round or pleomorphic shape with a 80-160 nm diameter, typical peplomers and a single-stranded, nonsegmented and positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb [Lai, 1990; Cavanagh et al., 1990; Spaan et al., 19881 . The genome of hemagglutinating (HA) coronaviruses encodes 4 structural proteins identified as HE, S, M and N. The hemagglutininlesterase or HE glycoprotein of 65 kDa, and its dimeric 126 kDa form, function in HA and have acetylesterase (AE) activity [Herder et al., 1985; Vlasak et al., 19881 . The S gene encodes the spike glycoprotein S of 185 kDa which is cleaved into the amino terminal S1 and the carboxy terminal S2 subunits. The S protein is involved in virus attachment to permissive cells, virus-induced cell fusion, induction of neutralizing antibodies, and HA functions [Sturman et al., 1985; Cavanagh et al., 1990; Schulze et al., 19913 . The M gene encodes the transmembrane glycoprotein M of 23-25 kDa, and the N gene encodes the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N of 50 kDa [Lai, 19901. Diarrhea samples from a 6-year-old boy suffering from severe watery diarrhea contained coronaviruslike particles in electron microscopic tests. We report here the isolation of the human coronavirus isolate designated as HECV-4408 and its propagation in human rectal tumor cell cultures as well as the characterization of its biological, antigenic, and genetic properties in comparison with BCV and HCV-OC43.",

After centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min, the supernatant fluid was collected for cell culture inoculation and electron microscopic examination.

Following 1 h of adsorption, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphorate-buffered saline (DPBS) and fresh DMEM was added. The cell cultures were kept in a 5% CO, incubator at 37\"C, and they were examined for cytopathic changes during a week-long incubation.

Biological characterization detected both HA and AE activities, indicating the presence of the HE glycoprotein on the virion. This evidence is strengthened by the electron microscopic visualization of shorter peplomers in addition to the typical spikes on the viral envelope and by the identification of the HE gene. In contrast, the Resta strain of human enteric coronavirus did not agglutinate chicken, mouse, or human type 0 erythrocytes. Furthermore, antiserum specific for BCV inhibited the HA activity of HECV-4408. The Resta strain did not react with antisera specific for MHV-A59, HCV-OC43 and HCV-E229 [Resta et al., 19851 .

Only one MAb specific for the S protein distinguished HCV-OC43 from BCV and HECV-4408. This MAb did not distinguish HECV-4408 from the wild-type BCV-LY138. Additionally, HECV in diarrhea fluid was found to be antigenically related to HCV-OC43 by immune EM [Battaglia et al., 19871 . Human and bovine sera contained high titers of antibodies reacting in infectivity neutralization, immunodiffusion, and immune EM tests with HCV-OC43 and BCV Storz and Rott, 1981; Debiaggi et al., 19861. Genetic characterization demonstrated that the genomic organization of HECV-4408 is identical to BCV and HCV-OC43. Moreover, the restriction pattern and size of the genes on the 3' genomic portion are similar to BCV. In contrast, HCV-OC43 differs from HECV-4088 and BCV by the restriction pattern of the M genes and by a genomic deletion within the nonstructural genes between S and M. A similar deletion distinguished respiratory and enteropathogenic porcine coronaviruses 1991b, 19921.

However, due to difficulties in isolation and propagation in cell cultures, the etiological role of HECV in the human gastrointestinal disease complex is most likely underdiagnosed. Additional information is needed about the relationship between HECV and other enteric HA coronaviruses and the zoonotic aspects of their transmission. The similarity between HECV-4408 and the highly virulent, wild-type BCV-LY138 led us to hypothesize that these viruses may infect and cause disease in human subjects and calves alike. Indeed, clinical, epidemiolog-ical, and serological observations imply that BCV infected human subjects and horses to cause diarrhea [Storz and Rott, 1981; Imagawa et al., 19903 . Infectivity neutralizing and other antibodies to BCV, HCV-OC43 and HECV were found in human and bovine sera [Storz and Rott, 1981; Cereda et al., 1986; Debiaggi et al., 1986; Schnagl et al., 1986,19901. The uniqueness of the HA coronaviruses is further substantiated by the presence and functions of the HE in the viral envelope in addition to the S protein. Both recognize the 9-0-acetylated sialic acid as receptor determinant [Schultze et al., 19911 . The HA coronavirus receptor with this determinant differs from the aminopeptidase N receptor for non-HA coronaviruses [Dveksler et al., 1991; Delma et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 19923 . Although the exact role of the HE in coronavirus pathogenesis is not clear, the presence of HE in these coronaviruses could broaden their host range. A recent report also demonstrated that the HA coronavirus MHV-JHM induced neurological disease in primates [Murray et al., 19921 . The epidemiology, host range, and possible cross-species transmission of the HA coronaviruses merit detailed investigations.",
