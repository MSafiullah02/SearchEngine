They expressed three arguments: (I) The intention of the reform is the dismantling of the secular state. It is intended to use it to demand clerical privileges: mainly replacement of secular education for religious instruction in public schools and control of mass media. (II) The handling of the reform in the concept of \u201cfreedom of religion.\u201d The redefinition of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d that the Catholic hierarchy seeks to establish offers a tendentious and biased concept of that freedom to provide religious education in public schools as a religious privilege. (III) The consequences of reform are an affectation of the freedoms of religious minorities. For example, religious education in public schools will cause that children and adolescents who profess a different faith then Catholic become victims of acts of intolerance and discrimination. Religion is also represented as a factor of division among students professing different faiths and as an element of social polarization that will damage seriously the living together.",

The issue of laicity is not only \u201cpolitical\u201d but also related to the \u201cminorities,\u201d who defend their \u201cvulnerability.\u201d The concept of the secular (lay = laico) state is dynamic, and is linked to social processes. In the debate on laicity are present new actors, and not only the traditional State\u2013church or churches but also women, academics, homosexuals, and indigenous people. Certainly, the \u201cpathology\u201d of laicity would be to reduce religion to the private sphere alone.
