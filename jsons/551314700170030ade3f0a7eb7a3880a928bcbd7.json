            "text": "experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign 28 environments. However, there is a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic 29 species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic 30 regions. To test the idea that penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the 31 viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. 32 Using total RNA-Sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin 33 associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82) and tick 34 viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of 35 virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, 36 including many of the same viral families. These data therefore reject the theory that 37 penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in 38 Introduction 43 Geographical separation and extreme climates have resulted in the long isolation of 44 Antarctica and the subantarctic islands. The result is a unique assemblage of animals, some 45 relying entirely on the frozen continent, with others utilizing the fringes. Such geographic 46 isolation has been proposed to explain why Antarctic fauna supposedly harbour a paucity of 47 viruses, and supported by the observation that captive Antarctic penguins are highly 48 susceptible to infectious diseases (1). It has therefore been hypothesized that Antarctic fauna 49 have evolved in a setting of low \"pathogen pressure\", reflected in limited microbial diversity 50 and abundance (1, 2). As a consequence, the potential for climate driven and human mediated 51 movement of microorganisms makes the expansion of infectious diseases to the Antarctic a 52 matter of considerable concern (1, 3-5). 53 To date, a small number of viral species have been described in Antarctic fauna (6). 54 Serological studies have revealed that Antarctic penguins are reservoirs for influenza A virus 55 (IAV), avian avulaviruses (formerly avian paramyxoviruses), birnaviruses, herpesviruses, and 56 flaviviruses (7-13). Despite improvements in the molecular tools for virus detection, it is only 57 in recent years that full viral genomes have been characterized (6). For example, 58 adenoviruses, astroviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, polyomaviruses and 59 papillomavirus have been identified in Ad\u00e9lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap 60 penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) (6, 14-22). 61 However, sampling is limited and genomic data sparse, such that we have a fragmented 62 understanding of virus diversity in penguins and in Antarctica in general. 63 Antarctic penguins may also be infected by viruses spread by ectoparasites, particularly the 64 seabird tick Ixodes uriae (White) (23). For example, seven different arthropod-borne viruses 65 (arboviruses) were identified in I. uriae ticks collected from King nymphs) were collected from Paradise Bay (Fig 1) . Ticks were collected under rocks within 106 and directly adjacent to penguin colonies and placed in RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at -107 80\u00b0C within 4-8 hours of collection. 108 RNA library construction and sequencing 109 RNA library construction, sequencing and RNA virus discovery was carried out as described (Table S1 ). Sequence reads were demultiplexed and trimmed with Trimmomatic followed by de novo 131 assembly using Trinity (34). No filtering of host/bacterial reads was performed before 132 assembly. All assembled contigs were compared to the entire non-redundant nucleotide (nt) 133 and protein (nr) database using blastn and diamond blast (35), respectively, setting an e-value 134 threshold of 1x10 -10 to remove false-positives. Abundance estimates for all contigs were determined using the RSEM algorithm (34). All 136 contigs that returned blast hits with paired abundance estimates were filtered to remove plant, 137 invertebrate fungal, bacterial and host sequences. Viruses detected in the penguin libraries 138 were divided into those likely to infect birds and those likely associated other hosts (36)(37). 139 This division was performed using a combination of phylogenetic analysis and information (Table S1 ). There was a large range in the total viral 185 abundance in both the penguin (0.07-0.7 % total viral reads; 0-0.15 % avian viral reads) and 186 tick libraries (0.03-2.4%) (Table S1, Fig 2) . In addition to likely avian viruses, the penguin 187 libraries contained numerous reads matching insect, plant, or bacterial viruses and 188 retroviruses (Fig 2A, Fig 3) . Retroviruses were excluded from later analyses due to the 189 challenges associated with differentiating exogenous from endogenous sequences using meta- sampling locations that are 130 km apart (Fig 3, Fig S3) . 213 Within the tick libraries, the greatest virus abundance was seen in the adult female ticks, Paramyxoviridae, Picorbirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae (Fig 2B, Fig 3) (see 229 below). Ten of the 13 avian associated viruses identified in the penguins likely represent 230 9 novel avian viral species (Table S2, Fig 4) Table S3 , Fig 3) . The largest diversity was found in the \"Narna-Levi\", \"Noda-Tombus\" and 245 \"Picorbirna-Pariti\" viral groups (36). A number of viruses were highly divergent, including 246 clusters of novel viruses that fell within the Narnaviridae and Leviviridae (Table S3, Fig 3) . (Fig 6A, Fig S9) We also identified a deltacoronavirus and an avastrovirus (Fig 6B, Fig S10-S11 ). The 294 deltacoronavirus was similar to those reported in birds in the United Arab Emirates, 295 Australia, Niger, and Finland, with ~95% identity. A lack of sampling makes it challenging to 296 determine how deltacoronaviruses in Antarctica and other continents may be shared (Fig   297   S10 ). The astrovirus detected was similar (88.3% identity) to a short fragment (1000 bp) 298 previously reported in Adelie penguins on the Ross ice shelf of Antarctica (22) (Table S2) , a 299 pattern confirmed by phylogenetic analysis (Fig 6B) . Phylogenetic analysis also reveals that 300 this virus falls in an outgroup to Group 2 viruses, including Avian Nephritis virus (Fig 6B, 301 Fig S11) . Although we were unable to determine the epidemiology of these viruses in 302 Antarctica, repeated detection on opposite ends of the Antarctic continent makes it possible 303 that this is a penguin specific virus. (Fig 4) . 320 The six other novel virus species identified in the tick libraries comprised five viral families: RdRp sequences currently available, exhibiting just 35.7% amino acid sequence similarity to 328 the divergent tick-borne tetravirus-like virus (Fig S12) . A novel colti-like virus (Reoviridae), 329 Fennes virus, was identified in the adult male, female and nymph libraries, although we were 330 only able to assemble four segments. Notably, Fennes virus falls basal to the existing 331 coltivirus group, exhibiting just 30% amino acid sequence similarity to Shelly headland virus, 332 recently identified in Ixodes holocyclus ticks from Australia (Fig 7) . The partial genome of a 333 Rhabdovirus, Messner virus, was identified in the adult female library. However, this 334 fragment was of low abundance, and only the RdRp segment (Fig S12) . (Table S2) . Combined, these data strongly suggest that penguins are not merely spill-over hosts, but may 379 be central reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses. This is apparent in two observations. 380 The first is the repeated detection of specific virus species, such as avian avulaviruses, and In sum, we reveal substantial viral diversity in Antarctic penguins, their diet and their ticks. 433 We therefore expect that additional viruses will be identified with increased sampling, Table S3 , and phylogenetic 632 trees for each virus family can be found in Figs 5-8, S5-S12). 633 ",

Amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT 155 (40), with poorly aligned sites removed using trimAL (41). The most appropriate model of 156 amino acid substitution was determined for each data set using IQ-TREE (42) or PhyML 3.0 157 (43), and maximum likelihood (ML) trees were then estimated using PhyML. For initial 158 family and clade level trees, SH-like branch support was used to determine the topological 159 support for individual nodes. Virus clusters providing the most relevant background 160 information to the novel viruses identified in here were then extracted and phylogenetic 161 analysis repeated using PhyML with 1000 bootstrap replicates. In the case of previously 162 described viruses, phylogenies were also estimated using nucleotide sequences. 163 Viral diversity and abundance across libraries 164 Relative virus abundance was estimated as the proportion of the total number of viral reads in 165 each library (excluding rRNA). All ecological measures in the penguin libraries were 166 calculated only using viruses likely associated with birds. Host-association is less complex in 167 7 tick samples, and in this case we used the full tick data set, only excluding the Leviviridae 168 that are associated with bacterial hosts. Analyses were performed using R observed virome richness and Shannon effective [alpha] diversity were calculated 171 for each library at the virus family and genus levels using the Rhea script sets (44), and 172 compared between avian orders using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.

The abundance of COX1 in tick libraries was consistent with the body size of the ticks 194 included in each library, with the highest abundance in the large adult female ticks and the 195 lowest abundance in the first of two nymph libraries (Fig 2D-F). 196The abundance of avian viral reads was the highest in Chinstrap penguins sampled on197    Kopaitik Island (0.152% of total reads), and the lowest in Gentoo penguins sampled at Island where all three penguin species were sampled(Fig S1, S2). Hence, the 203 reason we detected no viral reads at the most southern sampling site (the GGV Base) may be 204 due to a combination of location and species choice (Gentoo penguins).205 Although there was variation in virus composition among libraries, members of the 206 Picornaviridae were the most abundant in the Chinstrap and Adelie penguin libraries, 207 comprising 99%, 32%, 83% and 71% of all the avian viral reads in these four libraries.

This257 virus is closely related to Goose calicivirus and caliciviruses sampled from waterbirds in 258 Australia (i.e. Red-necked Avocet and Pink-eared Duck) (32, 48). All the picornaviruses 259 identified in this study likely belong to novel or unassigned genera (Fig S6). Three different 260 variants of Shirase virus were identified in Adelie penguins, two from King George Island 261 and one from Kopaitik Island. Interestingly, Shirase virus falls as a sister lineage to viruses of 262 10 the genus Gallivirus. Similarly, two variants of Wedell virus were identified identified in both Gentoo (Shackleton virus) and Adelie (Mawson virus) 268 penguins. Shackleton virus falls as an outgroup to a clade of rotaviruses recently described in 269 wild birds, which are themselves divergent from Rotavirus G virus, while Mawson virus is a 270 sister group to rotavirus D (Fig 5A). Hilary virus, a picobirnavirus, was found in a clade that 271 contains both avian and mammalian hosts. Interestingly, this virus is most closely related to a 272 human picorbirnavirus, albeit with low amino acid similarity and long branch lengths (Fig 273 S7). Although there certainty as to whether these viruses are bacterial rather than vertebrate 274 associated (49), they are retained here for comparative purposes. 275 Finally, although most of the novel viruses documented here had RNA genomes, we also 276 identified a novel alphaherpesvirus, Oates virus, that falls as a sister group to Gallid and 277 Psittacid hepervirus 1.

Similarly, we detected an H5N5 influenza A virus in Chinstrap 282 penguins identical in sequence to that reported previously. This is not surprising as the virus 283 described in Hurt et al. (2016) was isolated in the same set of samples (Fig S8). In addition, 284 we identified Avian avulavirus 17 (AAvV-17) in Adelie penguins from both sampling 285 locations",

Indeed, viruses have now been identified both in 342 the environment (e.g. Antarctic lakes), and in wildlife. We aimed to test the hypothesis that 343 Antarctic penguin colonies experience low pathogen pressure as a result of their geographic 344 and climatic isolation, employing meta-transcriptomic virus discovery from three penguin 345 species and their ticks. Critically, we demonstrate the presence of 13 viral species in these 346 penguins and nine in ticks associated with penguin nesting sites. These data counter the idea 347 that animals in the Antarctic harbour less microbial diversity than animals from other 348 geographic regions. Indeed, the penguins sampled show similar levels of virome diversity as 349 Australian wild birds (32, 48). Recent virome studies of Australian birds revealed an alpha 350 diversity (observed richness) of 5.37 and 5.8 per library, with an average of 2.87 and 3.1 viral 351 genomes and 60% and 80% of viruses being novel (32, 48). In comparison, in the penguins 352 studied here we observed an average richness of 4.6 and 2.8 viral genomes per library, with a 353 virus discovery rate of 76%. There was also an impressive level of viral diversity in the tick 354 libraries considering the small sample size: eight novel virus species and a single previously 355 identified species were identified in 20 ticks, compared to 19 novel viruses in 146 ticks from 356 Australia (33). Finally, in both the penguin and tick associated viruses revealed we identified 357 similar viral families to those documented previously (32, 33, 48). This strongly suggests uncertain. Ten Chinstrap penguins sampled on King George Island harboured five 362 different viral species, mostly from the Picornaviridae, at very high abundance (0.15% of 363 total reads). Adelie penguins also had high viral diversity, with apparently healthy birds 364 carrying three or four viral species. Perhaps more striking was that Adelie penguins on King 365 George Island and the Antarctic peninsula shared viruses, despite the greater than 100 km 366 distance between these colonies. A similar trend was observed by Wille et al. (2019a) who 367 found that Adelie penguins sampled in 2013 shared avian avulavirus 17 and 19 across these 368 two locations, thereby revealing a connectivity between penguin colonies. Whether this is due 369 to overlapping foraging grounds, prospecting birds visiting different colonies, viral vectors in 370 the form of predatory and scavenging birds such as Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes 371 gigantes), Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) or Skuas (Stercorarius spp.) (51, 52), or another 372 unimagined route is unclear. Penguins sampled on King George Island and Kopaitik Island 373 had similar alpha diversity at the virus family and genus levels. Interestingly, no avian viral 374 reads or genomes were detected in the samples from Gentoo penguins at GGV. Whether this 375 is due to geographic structuring of avian viruses in Antarctica, the species sampled at this 376 location (i.e. Gentoo penguins tended to have lower diversity than either Adelie or Chinstrap 377 penguins) or another process merits further investigation.378",

The vertebrate 407 reservoirs of coltiviruses have been only confirmed for Colorado tick fever virus and Tai 408 forest reovirus -rodents and free tailed bats, respectively -although other members of the 409 genus are suspected to infect rodent species. Interestingly, the viruses identified in I. uriae 410 from Macquarie Island in a series of three studies between the 1970s and 2009 belonged to 411 just four families -Reoviridae, Narioviridae, Phenuiviridae and Flaviviridae (23-25) -three 412 of which were present here. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that six of the remaining 413 seven virus species identified within the tick data were likely associated with invertebrates, 414 with one other virus (Mackintosh virus) likely a bacteriophage from the family Leviviridae. 415 There was extensive diversity of viruses identified in the penguin samples that were likely to 416 be associated with hosts other than birds, including entire clades of novel viruses within 417 phylogenetic trees of the Narnaviridae and Leviviridae. Given their phylogenetic position 418 these viruses are likely associated with the fish, crustacean and plant species ingested by the 419 penguins as part of their diet, as well as infecting unicellular parasites, fungi and bacteria. A 420 number of these viruses may also be associated with penguin gut flora: indeed, cloacal swabs 421 are used extensively in studies of bird gut microbiomes (56, 57). Due to the nature of the 422 15 cloacal swabs, it is impossible to accurately determine the host for these viruses, although 423 some information can be gleaned from the families in which these virus fall. For example, the 424 Narnaviridae are known to infect fungi and protists, while the related Leviviridae infect 425 bacteria (58-61). Other novel viruses fell within invertebrate associated clades of the 426 Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae, associated with both vertebrate and invertebrate infecting 427 viruses in the Picornavirales (36). There were also a number of novel viruses identified that 428 clustered within the Picobirnaviridae/Partitiviridae group. While the Partitiviridae are 429 recognised as invertebrate associated viruses, the host association of the Picobirnaviridae is 430 currently uncertain (49).

Samples were collected as previously described (15, 16). Briefly, samples were collected 88 from the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic peninsula from Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Adelie penguins in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively (Table S1). A cloacal swab was 90 collected from each penguin a using a sterile-tipped swab, placed in viral transport media, 91 and stored at -80 \u00b0C within 4-8 hours of collection.

Kopaitik Island 94 is a mixed colony containing these three penguin species, although no survey has been 95 performed since 1996 (31).
