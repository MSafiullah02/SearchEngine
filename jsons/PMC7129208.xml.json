The washing step was repeated until the gel bands were clear. And then the gel band was completely dried by a Speed-Vac Vacuum centrifuge apparatus (Savant, Holbrook, NY) and cut into small pieces. The dried pieces were re-swollen by adding about 30 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.3).

The gradient started at 5% B, held for 2 min, and went linearly to 80% B in 50 min. The peptide mixture was injected into the column by an autosampler and separated at a flow rate of 200 \u03bcl/min. The fractions were detected by PDA (TSP UV6000) and directly introduced on-line into ESI source. The operating condition was optimized with standard solution provided by manufactures and the working parameters of ion source were as follows: capillary temperature, 200 \u00b0C; spray voltage, 5 kV; capillary voltage, 15 V; and sheath gas flow rate, 20 arb. To get more mass spectra within an LC peak, two types of scan modes, full scan and MS/MS (with data-dependent), were used for acquiring more data points.
