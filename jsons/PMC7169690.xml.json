            "text": "WHO reports about the global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) showed that the case fatality ratio (CFR) in mainland China was about 6%, considerably lower than in other affected countries and areas such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where the CFR was about 17% (Feng et al. 2009). Proper identification of risk factors for the CFR may explain this striking difference. However, there has never been a report using the overall data of Chinese cases to describe and analyse the CFR. Published articles on CFR only reported results for different Chinese provinces such as Hong Kong (Karlberg et al. 2004), Beijing (Chen et al. 2005), Guangdong (Peng et al. 2003), Shanxi (Mei et al. 2003), Tianjin (Wang et al. 2003a) and Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (Tao et al. 2003). Although some general conclusions were put forward such as the strong association with old age, some results, such as the contribution of sex, were controversial (Karlberg et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2005). In addition, it was difficult to predict the risk of death for SARS patients because of the limited data based on individual regions and without taking the overall epidemic in mainland China into consideration. The previous publications were further limited; in that, some important parameters (e.g. period of the epidemic) were not included and often only univariate regression analysis was performed on the data (Chen et al. 2005). In addition, as SARS\u2010related reports were required as soon as possible during the emergent epidemic, it is understandable that some data were not yet available in the early reports. For a full insight into the epidemiological features of the epidemic, it was necessary to carefully organise all available information from mainland China in one comprehensive database (Feng et al. 2009).",

Occupation was classified into three main groups: (i) healthcare worker (HCW), (ii) high economic status (HES) worker (i.e. businessman, civil servant or teacher) and (iii) low economic status (LES) worker (farmer, day\u2010care worker/nanny, waiter/waitress or worker). \u2018Unknown\u2019 was used if occupation was not recorded. Children, retired people and students (\u2018other\u2019) were not considered as a special group because of the high correlation with age, and treated as missing in univariate analysis. The period of the SARS epidemic in mainland China was defined by the calendar date of the onset of symptoms since the first SARS case (16 November 2002) in Guangdong Province.",

Table 1 also shows that CFR increased dramatically with age, leading to the risk of dying among cases aged 60 years and older being 10 times higher than among cases younger than 40 (about 25%vs. 2%). The CFR of HCW (3.3%) was by far the lowest among all occupational groups. The cases in Guangdong Province (3.6%), and to a lesser extent Shanxi (5.4%), had the lowest risk of dying from SARS, whereas Tianjin showed the highest CFR (12.0%). Beijing (7.3%) and the other areas showed average values. Figure 1 reveals that the difference between levels of CFR in Tianjin (highest), Beijing (moderate) and Guangdong (lowest) is fully explained by the difference in fatality for cases of 50 years and above. SARS cases with a younger age all had an equally low case fatality. Duration from onset to admission does not associate with CFR (Table 1). In addition, CFR does not seem to show a particular trend with period of the epidemic (Table 1); however, when plotted for different geographic locations, it becomes clear that CFR has reduced consistently over time (Figure 2). Strikingly, Guangdong showed an increase in CFR about 3\u20134 months after onset of the epidemic.",

However, the significant effect of occupation (HCW vs. non\u2010HCW) disappeared, whereas that of sex seemed to reverse by showing an almost significantly higher risk for females. Clearly, the relatively low CFR for females and HCWs was largely because of relatively young age of many of these cases. As Figure 2 illustrates, the period of epidemic shows a significant decreasing effect in the multivariate model after adjusting for other factors, in particular geographic location (Table 1). The interaction of period of epidemic and location was not significant (P = 0.334), indicating that the downward trend in CFR is about equal for each geographic location.",

This may largely be due to the fact that many elderly patients had chronic diseases, and when they suffered from SARS, their health condition deteriorated easily. This was amplified by the relatively higher number of old people who contracted SARS in the hospital while suffering from life\u2010threatening other morbidity. The presence of co\u2010morbid conditions is associated with poor outcomes, such as death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation of SARS patients (Booth et al. 2003; Chan et al. 2003; Fowler et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003; Wong et al. 2003; Gomersall et al. 2004).

Our large database also suggests that gender does not play an important role. The initial higher risk of dying among males was reversed into a borderline statistically significant higher risk for females after correction for other factors. Still, if anything, the risk for females is only slightly higher than for males (OR = 0.83).",

In our study of mainland China, HCWs also showed a much lower CFR than non\u2010HCWs (3.3%vs. 6\u201310%). From multivariate analysis, however, it turned out that being HCW or not was not a significant factor anymore. Apparently, the low CFR among HCWs can fully be explained by their relatively young age. HCW factor was also not significant after correction for age in the reports from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Thus, HCW apparently did not benefit from being closer to rapid and appropriate health care.",

First of all, the cases in Tianjin were older than in other parts of China (median age of 42 vs. 33 years). In addition, after correction for age, however, cases in Tianjin of over 50 showed a higher risk of dying than in Beijing and Guangdong. The high CFR in Tianjin may be due to the special situation that 120 out of 175 cases (68.6%) were hospital inpatients (Wang et al. 2003a). This percentage is unknown for other areas in China, but the proportion of HCW cases among all SARS cases in Tianjin is also much higher than for other areas (39%vs. 19%), also illustrating the high rate of nosocomial infection in this city. Thus, the general lower health status of these hospitalised Tianjin cases may be the major explanation for the high mortality risk. The fact that geographic differences were only present for age group older than 50 years further supports that the degree of being hospitalised at the time of infection was an important factor.",

It is striking that even in its first months, Guangdong showed a lower CFR (6\u20138%) than the first months in other provinces (12\u201316%). We have no clear explanation for this finding, but it has been suggested that over\u2010reporting of SARS cases may have been a problem in Guangdong (Chen et al. 2004); the use of particular traditional Chinese medicine (Zhong 2004), and even air pollution (Cui et al. 2003) may have played a role.",

First, the SARS cases in China had a relatively younger age (median 33 years) than in other areas, e.g. Hong Kong (40), Taiwan (46) and Canada (49); (Feng et al. 2009). Consequently, the proportion of individuals at higher risk of dying (i.e. those of 50 years and above) is also higher in these areas. Using the age\u2010related CFR values of mainland China (as resulted from our study) for the age distributions of SARS cases in Hong Kong and Canada resulted in an expected overall CFR of about 9.2% (data not shown). This is indeed higher than the overall value in mainland China (6.4%), but still much lower than the actual values of 17.2% and 17.1% in Hong Kong and Canada, respectively. Thus, the relatively young age of Chinese SARS patients can only partly explain their low case fatality.",

Third, the CFR in all provinces (apart from Guangdong) started with levels comparable to the average CFR in other areas (about 12\u201316%; Figure 2), but fell over time as a result of improved care. In many areas, the epidemic may not have lasted long enough to establish the same improvement.
