One of its most common manifestations is bilateral pneumonia, which, in its most severe forms, is associated with profound hypoxemia. This presentation is usually treated as a type of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due to association described between right ventricle (RV) dysfunction and ARDS, 1 some COVID-19 patients may develop this complication. We present a case in which this reasoning was not followed.",

His blood pressure was 125/90 mmHg, heart rate 136 bpm, respiratory rate 30 bpm, and oxygen saturation (SatO2) < 85% on room air. Physical examination showed signs of hypoperfusion and use of accessory respiratory muscles. Therefore, a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected and noninvasive mechanical ventilation was started without response. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia, STsegment elevation in inferior leads, and ST depression in V2-V4, I and AvL ( figure 1A) . Thoracic X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Echocardiography showed important RV dilatation, apex hypercontractility, RV lateral wall akinesia, and interventricular septal shift due to pressure overload, as well as an estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PAsP) > 60 mmHg.",

At that time, with suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE), thrombolytic treatment with alteplase was started, according to clinical practice guidelines. The patient started improving progressively, reaching SatO2 90% and hemodynamic stability. Afterward, acute bilateral PE was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (figure 2A) with a finding of diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities in pulmonary parenchyma suggesting an atypical viral infectious etiology (figure 2B). A postreperfusion ECG showed normalization of secondary repolarization changes, with persistence of RV overload ( figure 1B) .

Two major differences in contrast with classic ARDS can decrease the risk of RV failure in SARS-CoV-2 3 : a) a blunted hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and b) a higher lung compliance.

Although ST-segment elevation has been described in anteroseptal leads (V1-V4) in patients with PE, 5 there are no data on ST elevation in inferior leads in PE. RV overload is the most widely accepted hypothesis but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although embolic events in coronary arteries have been described, in our case, the ECG changes were attributed to profound hemodynamic instability and decreased blood oxygen content leading to myocardial hypoperfusion. Our decision to use fibrinolysis was guided mainly by the presence of signs of RV overload, severe pulmonary hypertension with refractory hypoxemia, persistent hypotension, and McConnell's sign, independently of the possibility of concomitant myocardial ischemia. Severe pulmonary hypertension and McConnell's sign are exceptional in RV infarction. This reasoning is consistent with the very low increase in troponin I, no ischemic changes on ECGs and echocardiograms during follow up, and the normal results of coronary angiography.",

Nonetheless, in our case, this procedure was not indicated due to high pretest probability and low quality of coronary artery images due to tachycardia and hemodynamic instability. 6 In conclusion, COVID-19 complications challenge our diagnostic skills.
