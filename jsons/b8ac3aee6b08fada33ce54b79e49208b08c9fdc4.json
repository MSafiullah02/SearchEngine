Yes, they practiced Christianity, but also followed the traditions of their ancestors. Women in her village prayed to Jesus and God, but also to their ancestors. Outsiders sometimes questioned how the Kissi could follow both Christianity and their old traditions, but Sia had never seen a problem. Ancestors after all, were the ones who communicated with God. When someone in the family died, they were escorted to the realm of the ancestors where they were able to protect the living family and speak to God on their behalf. Ancestors continued to live in the village, but in their new form. Sia shivered thinking of what happened to those who died and were not escorted to the realm of the ancestors. Ceremonies were usually performed by the brother of the deceased. If the ceremonies were not done properly, a loved one would become a wandering ghost instead of an ancestor. Wandering ghosts torment the living bringing misfortune to everyone in the village, especially to the family that failed to perform the proper rights. Sia did not like to think of such things, but there had been several deaths in a nearby village and she could not help but to wonder if it was the work of a wandering ghost.",

Reston is highly pathogenic for non-human primates and pigs, and Bombali has been discovered in free-tailed bats as part of ongoing research to discover the Ebola reservoir. The Zaire species was responsible for the first Ebola virus outbreak in 1976 and is considered to be the deadliest of the six [63] . Initially the disease caused by Ebola virus was called Ebola hemorrhagic fever, but later studies showed that the hemorrhagic manifestations were less common than initially thought and subsequently the name was changed to Ebola Virus Disease (EBD).",

It has also been shown that, at least in primates, Ebola can be spread through intramuscular injection, and inoculation can occur through contact of the conjunctiva or oral mucosa with infected body fluids [61] . Blood, vomitus, and feces are the body fluid most likely to spread infection because of the frequency with which they are encountered during the course of the illness, but other fluid such as urine, semen, vaginal fluid, tears, sweat, and breast milk also have potential for viral transmission [2, 5, 70, 88, 97, 112] .",

In the initial outbreak of 1976, health care workers reusing glass syringes and needles in a community clinic may have inadvertently caused spread of infection. The facility consisted of a 120-bed hospital and a busy outpatient center which treated between 6000 and 12,000 people per month. At the beginning of each day, nurses were given five syringes each which were reused after a warm water rinse. Unfortunatly, this is where Ebola made its first appearance. Potentially hundreds were exposed from this clinic alone [12, 122] . There have been many other instances where hospitals have turned into epicenters for Ebola outbreaks [86, 103] . Early detection and isolation is key to preventing similar incidents in the future.",

Regardless, it is a safe conclusion that none of these countries are even close to having the recommended 1 physician per 1000 residents recommended by the WHO. Each of these countries is unique in the health care challenges it faces, and only are mentioned here because they have all been touched by Ebola. Infrastructure development is generally associated with improved health and decreased disease burden, but this is not always the case.

One description of a traditional medical ceremony in Sudan describes a medicine man and his assistants. First, ritualistic dance and chants are performed. Next the medicine man shows his spiritual power by having a large rock placed on his abdomen and broken by an ax while he remains still. Once his strength has been established, his attention can be turned to his patient. The medicine man's diagnosis is mental illness caused by evil ancestors who have returned with the purpose of tormenting the patient. Incantations are the treatment [106] . Beliefs and practices such as this are common in rural Central Africa. In these societies, illness is viewed as a disruption in the relationship between God, ancestors, and the person affected. Witchcraft, sorcery, angry ancestors, and evil spirits may all be at the root of disease and a powerful medicine man can restore the proper balance in these relationships thus curing disease [84, 91] .

An affirmative response to any of these questions resulted in secondary screening.

If the secondary screen found a temperature <101.5, no risk factors for Ebola in the public health interview, and no symptoms of Ebola on the public health interview they were allowed to proceed to check-in.

At this population density vegetation became associated with and increase incidence of EVD [115] .
