            "text": "Widely divergent views regarding vaccines and their use have appeared recently in the human, veterinary, and lay literature (Carmichael, 1983; Dodds, 1991; Holmes, 1996; Pitcairn, 1995; Priest, 1996; Smith, 1995; Starita-Mehan, 1997; Tizzard, 1990; Yarnall, 1995). Strong opinions have been voiced by many individuals and an increasingly wide public desires to know \u201cthe facts\u201d that underlie vaccine use and the basis of immunization regimens. Impassioned, sometimes uninformed, concerns have been expressed regarding vaccine efficacy and safety, the need for certain vaccines, the frequency with which vaccines are given, the need for annual vaccination\u2014indeed, whether vaccines should be used at all! The questions are not new, for they have been raised since Mithridates VI, an ancient Greek king of Pontus (first century b.c.), attempted to protect himself against poisoning by repeatedly taking small amounts of noxious substances, in honey (theriaca)\u2014a practice not dissimilar to certain contemporary holistic rituals. Since the introduction of variolation from the Near East in the early eighteenth century and the use of cowpox virus against Variola, there has been public concern about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The concept of \u201csafety\u201d has changed with time, for reactions that were common when the risks of a serious disease were great are no longer acceptable. Although often exaggerated by individual passions, or groups who champion their own doctrines, several of today's concerns seem justified, especially when recognized problems with vaccines are not addressed in the light of existing knowledge or experience.",

This is illustrated by the full-day session devoted to vaccination practices at the July 1996 annual meeting of the AVMA at Cornell's Feline Practitioner's Seminar and at a recent symposium, European Symposium on Pet Vaccinology, held in France in September 1996. In an ideal world, real or presumed problems with companion animal vaccines would be addressed quickly and responsibly by industry, government regulatory officials, and the veterinary profession as soon as they are identified. Unfortunately, problems often are neglected or avoided. This circumstance contributes to confusion and the creation of myths, which often are enhanced by differing views of \u201cexperts\u201d who have sometimes formed their own conclusions with limited data or biased sampling designs.",

They have often become elevated to catastrophes, however, especially by those who advocate a radical philosophy but ignore the benefits provided by vaccines. Concerns have sometimes led to the senseless conclusion that all vaccines are dangerous and are a direct or indirect cause of chronic illness (\u201cvaccinosis\u201d). \u201cVaccinoses\u201d are claimed to range from \u201cdevastated immune systems, laziness, bowel disease, bloat, stained teeth, ulcers, chronic gastroenteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, and seizures,\u201d to list but a few conditions that have been cited (Duval and Giger, 1996; Pitcairn, 1995; Priest, 1996; Starita-Mehan, 1997; Yarnall, 1995). However, there are truths between the passion of some and indifference of others. Advocates of holistic vaccination practices, as inane as they may seem, may actually be doing a service to pet fanciers by bringing issues to the fore which have largely been ignored. Unfortunately, legitimate safety or efficacy problems have sometimes been disregarded until major misfortunes occurred. Nevertheless, those who experienced the rampant distemper outbreaks prior to the mid-1960s are amazed by the arguments presented by some critics, especially holistic believers. Within 2\u20133 years of the advent of efficacious distemper vaccines, the disease practically disappeared in vaccinated populations, but it has reappeared whenever vaccination had diminished. Undeniable progress has been made in the suppression of canine distemper and infectious hepatitis and, more recently, in controlling the canine parvovirus pandemic in a remarkably short period of time. However, the recent outbreaks of distemper in Scandinavia, and this year's epizootic in Alaska and northern Quebec, illustrate what may occur when distemper vaccine efficacy, or vaccine use, diminishes. Veterinarians and the public have become more sophisticated\u2014and litigious; they want to know the facts about treatments they use. Unfortunately, many essential facts regarding vaccines are lacking and myths continue to flourish.",

It has been well established that the immune system can respond normally to several different antigens\u2014an issue that seem to persist; however, some combined vaccines that had inadequate field trial data prior to release have given rise to serious consequences in regard to safety.

Such variants may fail to grow in the natural host, yet proliferate luxuriantly in tissue cultures or chick embryos. Because \u201cattenuation\u201d means reduction, not absolute loss of the capacity to produce disease, safety problems may not be revealed until extensive field tests have been conducted; unfortunately, this has occurred after a product has been licensed and marketed. A conspicuous example of such failure was the large number of dogs that died or suffered serious illness following the introduction of a live canine coronavirus vaccine in 1983 (Martin, 1985; Wilson et al., 1986). Also a vaccine judged harmless for one species may provoke illness in another one (Appel, 1987; Carmichael, 1997; Tizzard, 1990). Because of the uncertainty of absolute safety with certain vaccines, for example, distemper vaccinal strains propagated in canine cell cultures, live viral vaccines are not recommended for most wildlife species, pregnant animals, unweaned pups, or pups that are ill. Yet, breeders and some veterinarians continue to vaccinate pregnant dams, pups as early as 2 weeks of age, or use vaccines for pet species where safety information in limited (e.g., ferrets).",

The first licensed modified live CCV vaccine was rescinded shortly after its introduction in 1983 because of severe adverse reactions with lesions that resembled those of FIP (Martin, 1985). Those reactions occurred in an estimated 5% of vaccinated pups, generally ones <12 weeks of age. An inactivated CCV vaccine that had been licensed also was withdrawn from the market shortly after it was issued because of inadequate efficacy. In addition, a second licensed modified live CCV product which was combined with a canine cell-grown CD vaccine was withdrawn because of a high frequency of post vaccinal CD encephalitis. That vaccine has since been reformulated to exclude the distemper component, which appears to have contributed to the problem. Interestingly, the latter CCV vaccine strain had been licensed for use in California, where it had been marketed for more than 10 years in combination with CPV-2 and distemper vaccine, and the manufacturer affirmed that there had been no adverse reactions. The most recently licensed CCV vaccine comprises a killed FECV product, but information on that vaccine, as well as with most others, is limited mainly to promotional information.",

This view has been discussed at meetings on several occasions during the past 30 years, but it has been largely neglected because of considerations that involve industry interests, indifferent or overburdened government authorities, and the trust by veterinarians and dog owners in advertising. Vaccines and vaccination guidelines for physicians are supervised by the American Academy of Pediatric's Committee on Infectious Diseases and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices who advise the medical profession and regulatory authorities (Holmes, 1996).
