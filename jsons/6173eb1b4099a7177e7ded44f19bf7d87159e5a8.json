The rapid spread of the virus challenged diagnostic laboratories to rapidly develop molecular diagnostic methods. As SARS CoV-2 assays became available for testing on existing molecular platforms, laboratories devoted unprecedented energy and resources into evaluating the analytical performance of the new tests and in some cases developed their own diagnostic assays under FDA-EUA guidance. This study compares the validation of three different molecular assays at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Virology laboratory: the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ePlex\u00ae SARS-CoV-2, and the CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR tests. Overall, our studies indicate a comparable analytical performance of the three assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

The outbreak was followed by characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral genome within weeks of its discovery, which allowed the development of various molecular diagnostic assays. The implementation of in-house molecular diagnostics nationwide was slower than the emergence of the pandemic. It was not until February 4th, 2020 that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s COVID-19 real-time PCR assay received an emergency use authorization (EUA) (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergencysituations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations# covid19ivd). Clinical microbiology laboratories were not permitted to develop COVID-19 testing in house and apply for their own EUA approvals until February 29th, 2020. Soon after that date, only a few commercial assays were available with insufficient reagents to meet national demands. Of the first assays that were available for validations were the CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR panel assay (IDT, Coralville, IA) as well as the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), and both were initially validated for clinical use at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical Microbiology laboratory.",

The quick characterization of the full genome of the virus has enabled the development of multiple molecular diagnostic methods, however, nationwide implementation of molecular diagnostics in the US was delayed. In the US, the CDC defined criteria for defining patients under investigation and priorities for testing, however, extensive testing in other countries was instrumental in controlling the spread of the disease and identifying a more accurate case-fatality rates [12, 13] . Consequently, the implementation of laboratory developed testing in the US was essential to escalate the required testing capacity and to ensure rapid diagnosis that facilitated implementation of containment measures, utilization of high demand personal protective equipment and patient management. As so far, as molecular detection remains the gold standard for diagnosis, it is critical to understand the analytical performance of the available molecular assays.",

            "text": "In this study, we compared the analytical performance of three different molecular assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ePlex\u00ae SARS-CoV-2, and the CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR tests. The CDC assay and the GenMark ePlex target the N gene, and the Altona RealStar assay detects both the E and S genes. The three assays showed comparable analytical sensitivity that was between 600\u22121200 viral genome copies/ mL. There was 100 % agreement between the three assays for both negative and positive clinical specimens. Generally, the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay has a higher throughput than the CDC assay as the CDC assay requires three separate wells per specimen. The GenMark ePlex, although it has a relatively short turn-around-time, offers open access and easier workflow, its full implementation is limited by inadequate supplies and inventory. It is in general difficult to understand the differences in the analytical sensitivity of different molecular assays due to inherent variabilities in specimen processing and reference materials used for validations in different laboratories. This study offered a side by side comparison using the same extraction methodology (the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 and the CDC assays) and viral genomic materials which offers a better assessment of the analytical performance. Many questions remains to be answered about the clinical sensitivity of PCR assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the minimum acceptable analytical sensitivity. Different studies have shown different detection patterns of the viral RNA based on the specimen type and the specimen collection time in relation to the onset of symptoms. A recent study by a Chinese group showed that viral RNA is readily detectable in the nasopharyngeal, sputum, and stool specimens, with sputum specimens showing a more extended detection time frame that extends beyond 4 weeks (a mean of 22 days versus 16.2 days) and for both respiratory sources the peak viral load was during the first week after the onset of symptoms [14] . A different group consistently showed that the sputum as well as broncho-alveolar lavage specimens showed the highest positivity rates [15] . Additional studies from other groups showed lower sensitivity of PCR for early detection in highly suspected patients in comparison to CT scan [16] or serology [17] . Our data shows that many of our diagnosed specimens had viral loads that were below the assay's lower limit of detection (Ct range of 32.74 for the SARS-CoV-2 channel, NP sources (Table 4) , and Fig. 1) , which warrants an analytical sensitivity below 1200 copies/ mL to reduce the number of false negative results. In general, multiple factors other than the analytical sensitivity of the molecular assay could contribute to the clinical performance of various RNA detection methods. This includes the specimen collection time and the specimen quality when collected. Overall, it is appropriate to conclude that the RNA detection remains the assay of choice for COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis and until a better understanding of the dynamics of viral shedding and its correlation to the disease progression is achieved, assays with acceptable analytical performance are essential for enhancing the clinical diagnosis.",
