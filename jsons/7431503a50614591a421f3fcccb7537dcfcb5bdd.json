Of 22 persons, all washed hands after handling camels, 82% wore gumboots, and 65% wore overalls/dustcoats. None of the workers wore gloves or facemasks during slaughter processes. Fourteen percent reported drinking raw camel milk; 90% were aware of zoonotic diseases with most reporting common ways of transmission as: eating improperly cooked meat (90%), drinking raw milk (68%) and slaughter processes (50%). Sixteen (73%) were unaware of MERS-CoV. Use of personal protective clothing to prevent direct contact with discharges and aerosols was lacking. Although few people working with camels were interviewed, those met at this centralized slaughterhouse lacked knowledge about MERS-CoV but were aware of zoonotic diseases and their transmission. These findings highlight need to disseminate information about MERS-CoV and enhance hygiene and biosafety practices among camel slaughterhouse workers to reduce opportunities for potential virus transmission.",

The MERS-Co virus is thought to be transmitted from the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva of infected camels, especially through respiratory secretions because viral load has been found to be high in these sites . Camels have been reported to be infected simultaneously with more than one MERS-CoV and re-infection and viral shedding of camels previously infected with the virus had been reported (Farag et al., 2015) . This makes those exposed to camels potentially at an elevated risk of exposure compared to the general population.",
