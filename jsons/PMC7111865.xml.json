In the suckled beef calf, there are large differences in passive immunity between cow breed types (McGee et al., 2005a, McGee et al., 2005b, Murphy et al., 2005). Peak incidence of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) occurs in young calves, < 6 months of age, often in the face of pre-existing maternally derived antibodies (MDA) (Patel and Didlick, 2004). Infectious causes of BRD include viral (bovine herpesvirus-1 virus ((BoHV-1/infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus), bovine coronavirus (BoCV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V), bovine adenoviruses, bovine enterovirus-1, -2 and -3), bacteriological, (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni) and mycoplasmal agents (Mycoplasma bovis), many of which are indigenous residents of the bovine respiratory tract (Taylor et al., 2010a, Taylor et al., 2010b, Taylor et al., 2015, Brooks et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Many vaccine protocols have been developed to vaccinate young calves at frequencies as often as weekly during the first and second months of age. Finding any experimental studies that support this timing is difficult as limited research is available to indicate the true effectiveness of vaccine timing or ideal protocols for use in young calves (Chase, Hurley, and Reber, 2008). Viruses including BoHV-1, BRSV and PI-3V have an important role in BRD, not only in the pathogenesis of the disease but also in the development of immunosuppression (Murray et al., 2017). Furthermore, calf immunisation against BRD causing pathogens may be adversely affected by interference from maternally derived antibodies (Chase et al., 2008), neonatal hormonal factors (Morein, Abusugra, and Blomqvist, 2002) or unfavourable environmental conditions. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae of the Herpesviridae family. Vaccines currently used in BoHV-1 control programs in certain EU countries utilize highly attenuated BoHV-1 strains marked by a deletion of the glcoprotein E 9gE gene (Muylkens et al., 2006) also known as the Glycoprotein E (gE)-deleted marker vaccine. Glycoprotein E is the established virulence factor of all known members of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae (Van Engelenburg et al., 1994, Rebordosa et al., 1996).",

Two cow breeds were examined: Limousin \u00d7 Friesian (LF) (n = 17) and Charolais \u00d7 Limousin (CL) (n = 13). Mean parity (SD) for LF and CL cows was 5.5 (0.94) and 5.3 (1.03), respectively. The mean calving date was 28th February 2015 (26th January to 27th April). The cows were bred using an Aberdeen Angus (AA) and Charolais (CH) sires (natural mating). The beef suckler cows were housed in pens in a concrete slatted-floor shed in November 2014 and offered second-cut grass silage ad libitum (in vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) (615 g/kg). All cows received a mineral and vitamin supplement daily (60 g/head) while housed. The cows that calved prior to April were turned out to pasture in early April. Cows that calved from early April onwards were turned out within 2 to 7 days of calving. Prior to parturition (approximately 1 to 7 days) the cows were moved from the slatted-floor shed to straw bedded calving pens. Births were supervised by farm personnel to ensure that calves did not suckle the cow prior to implementing the experimental protocol for collection of the first blood sample from the calf. Immediately post-partum a tincture of 5% iodine was applied to the umbilical cord of each calf, and calf birth weight was recorded. All calves were closely observed to ensure suckling of the dam and any calf not suckling within 1 h of birth or showing signs of weakness was assisted to suckle the cow. After parturition, animals remained in the straw pens for a minimum of 4 days with the calf having free access to the dam. The calves had free access to their dams for suckling. Following parturition all cows received first cut grass silage ad libitum until turnout to pasture from the 20th March to the 10th April 2015. Meteorological conditions during the spring calving season (January to June 2015) recorded a mean ambient temperature of 7 \u00b0C (temp. Range \u2212 2.7 \u00b0C to 20.6 \u00b0C), mean dry bulb temperature of 7.2 \u00b0C, and a mean wet bulb temperature of 5.9 \u00b0C.",

REML linear mixed models, was performed to detect significant differences between experimental breeds. The statistical model consisted of the individual animal as the experimental unit in all analyses. Breed was the fixed effect within the model. Animal was included in each model as a random effect. For repeated measures, sampling time was included as the repeated measure. Non-statistically significant interactions were removed from all the models. The type of variance-covariance structure used was chosen depending on the magnitude of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for models run under compound symmetry, unstructured, autoregressive, heterogeneous 1st order autoregressive, or Toeplitz variance-covariance structures. The model with the least AIC value was selected. The differences between mean values were determined by F-tests using Type III sums of squares. The PDIFF was applied as appropriate to evaluate pairwise comparisons between means. A probability of P < 0.05 was selected as the level of significance and statistically tendencies were reported when P < 0.10. Average daily gain (ADG) was determined by linear regression analysis.

Mean white blood cell number was greater at birth in the progeny of LF cows, however, numbers subsequently decreased and were within the reference range at the other sampling times (Knowles et al., 2000, Zanker et al., 2001). Neutrophil number was greater than reference values at the 24 h sampling time and then reached normal reference values on subsequent sampling days. It is probable that the increased WBC and neutrophil number (neutrophilia) within 24 h of birth may be attributed to greater cortisol concentration in circulation. Neutrophilia and reductions in the number of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils in circulation have been associated with the stress response to raised cortisol in circulation in bovine animals (Burton et al., 2005, Lynch et al., 2012, O'Loughlin et al., 2014). Moreover, Chase et al. (2008) reported that calves produce high levels of cortisol at parturition and serum cortisol concentrations remain increased throughout the first week post birth. The number of B cells is greatly reduced in the neonate at 4% of the total lymphocytes at a week of age and increase gradually to 20% of total lymphocytes at 6\u20138 weeks of age. This low number of B cells coupled with the TH2 environment induced by the calves endogenous corticosteroids, maternal and placenta hormones results in a lack of an antibody response until at least three weeks of age.",

BoHV-1 virus causes respiratory infections and abortions in cattle, and is an important component of the bovine respiratory disease complex, which causes a considerable economic loss worldwide (Chowdhury, Wei, Weiss, Pannhorst, and Paulsen, 2016). Pre-partum vaccination programs have been reported to increase colostral antibodies and protect newborn calves from viruses associated with calf pneumonia, for example, Mannheimia haemolytica, BRSV, and PI3V (Makoschey et al., 2012, Dudek et al., 2014). M. haemolytica is a primary bacterial pathogen associated with BRD (Reddy et al., 2012). Thus, specific pre-partum immunisation of cows provides a significant increase in specific antibody protection against infectious disease via colostrum intake, and effectively stimulates a natural immune response in their offspring (Crouch, Oliver, and Francis, 2001). Vaccination of the young calf is often practiced in an effort to provide additional protection from common disease causing pathogens during the first few months of life, as the immune system matures and maternal antibodies decay (Chase et al., 2008).",

Cowley, Clegg, Doherty, and More (2011) reported herd-level seroprevalence of BoHV-1 in Ireland at a rate of 74.9%, which is in agreement with previous findings for bulls (O'Grady et al., 2008), and with the results of the present study. Our findings showed that the cows had total BoHV-1 wt antibodies circulating in their blood; this indicated that these animals had been naturally exposed to BoHV-1 at some stage in their lifetime. Consequently we found calves to have a considerable level of BoHV-1 (wt) as well as BRSV antibodies circulating in their blood post colostral consumption as a result of MDAs. This finding supports a study that was carried out in Ireland during 2009 to estimate dairy and beef herd seroprevalence of BoHV-1; findings showed a high seroprevalence of 74.9% (95% C.I. 69.9 to 79.8%), where only 2% of herds within the study vaccinated the dams, which indicates that infection in widespread (Cowley et al., 2011). This is similar to reports from the UK where 83.2% of unvaccinated herds had a minimum of one BoHV-1 seropositive animal, and the mean cattle and herd sero-prevalence of BoHV-1 was 42.5% and 43.1%, respectively (Woodbine et al., 2009).",

Therefore the greater the antibody concentration, the longer time it takes for MDAs to decay. This may be due to the high quality and timely manner in which calves suckled their dams post-birth. It is likely therefore that at 14 days post birth not all of these MDAs have decayed. Furthermore, Chamorro et al. (2014) reported that calves with adequate IgG concentration can have highly variable responses to specific respiratory viruses such as BRSV and BoHV-1. It has been suggested that this may be due to the differences in maternal colostrum sources, dam vaccination history, natural exposure to infection and levels of specific viral antibodies in the colostrum.",

This may be due to the presence and interference of maternal antibody from colostrum and the immaturity of the immune system at this young age (Tyler, Cullor, Thurmond, Douglas, and Dellinger, 1989). Although post primary or secondary vaccination did not result in an increase in antibody levels in the blood, it is likely that a cell mediated response may have occurred post vaccination (Fulton et al., 2004). BRSV is a challenging issue in calves; maternal antibodies are often present in 1 to 6 month old calves, this can have a knock on effect on vaccination programs because these antibodies do not decay until approximately 40 days of age (van der Poel et al., 1999, Chase et al., 2008). Our results are similar with no response to vaccination.",

However the efficacy of the gE negative vaccine was reduced in calves which received maternal antibodies. Passively acquired antibodies to BRD viruses affect the development of active immunity to these viruses in calves. The presence of potentially \u2018inhibitory\u2019 maternally derived antibodies, in combination with the bias of the immature neonatal immune system towards Th2 responsiveness, are clear obstacles to the effectiveness of vaccines delivered in the neonatal period (Morein et al., 2002).",

The results demonstrated that repeated vaccination of the dams with the gE marker vaccine produced a gE negative colostrum with very high levels of BoHV-1 antibody and that calves efficiently consumed the colostrum to acquire adequate transfer of passive immunity. As expected the maternally derived antibody titres for the specific respiratory viruses were at their peak levels post colostrum ingestion. Antibodies to the gE antigen of BoHV-1 tested negative within both treatment groups as a result of pre-parturient immunisation. There were no differences between the progeny of CL and LF cows in the level of BRSV antibodies post vaccination at 2 weeks of age and post booster vaccination 4 weeks later. Further research relating to BRD complex infections and the processes involved in the acquisition of immunity via vaccination are required to both improve the effectiveness of current preventative immunisation strategies and to aid development of new and more effective vaccines that could be used in the presence of MDAs.",
