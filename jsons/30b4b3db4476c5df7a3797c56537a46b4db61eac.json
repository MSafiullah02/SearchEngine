Previous studies have primarily focused on mouse models transduced with an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor to evaluate the effect of antibodies against MERS infection. However, nonhuman primate models, which faithfully mimic human disease to a maximum extent, will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans and will be effective models for evaluating the efficacy of potential treatment strategies [45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 816, "end": 820, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The antibody 3B11 was isolated from a nonimmune human phage antibody library [27] . To our knowledge, this antibody has been the only MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody examined in rhesus monkeys, resulting in mild and self-limiting diseases [46]. Treatment with 3B11 reduced lung pathology in infected rhesus monkeys; however, because viral RNA was undetectable in both model and neutralizing antibody-treated animals, the precise in vivo inhibitory effect of this antibody remains hard to determine. As the only neutralizing antibody from a MERS-CoV survivor, LCA60 was capable of higher neutralizing activity (showing 10-fold more potency than 3B11) [47] . However, the anti-MERS efficacy for LCA60 in primates has not yet been reported. Another nonhuman primate model with the common marmoset has been developed, in which marmosets are intratracheally infected with MERS-CoV. This model supports viral growth and shows evidence of histological lesions, progressive severe pneumonia, and high viral titers in the lungs and trachea, mimicking severe MERS disease in humans, which will ensure a better preclinical analysis of treatments before proceeding to clinical trials in humans [34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 81, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the present study, we also took advantage of the common marmoset to assess the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies of MCA1. All M groups developed serious MERS disease and suffered from fever and noticeable body weight losses. Treatment with MCA1, both before and after exposure to viral infection, improved the clinical and pathological features in the infected marmosets. No viral titer was detected in MCA1-treated animals at 3 days after infection in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments. In contrast, the mean viral titer in the lobes of the lungs reached peak values at 3 days after infection, which was >5.5 log 10 TCID 50 per gram in the M group. The results of prophylactic experiments showed that MCA1 will be beneficial to the prevention of a MERS outbreak, serving as a prophylactic for high-risk individuals exposed to MERS-CoV. Because the 5-mg/kg treatment dose was effective, large inoculum volumes are not required. Viral replication and titer are important during the course of disease development [48] . In a previous study, viral replication was not completely inhibited [44] . However, the results of the present study showed that viral replication could be completely inhibited using MCA1 in common marmosets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1111, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Preliminary research data showed that marmosets infected with MERS-CoV exhibited obvious focal pneumonia after 24 hours. In the present study, all model common marmosets also showed severe pathological changes in the lungs at 3 days after infection. In MCA1-treated animals, both the severity and the area of bronchointerstitial pneumonia were improved to certain degrees. Histopathology detection also showed that the effects in the high-dose prophylaxis group (20 mg/kg) were better than those in the low-dose prophylaxis group (5 mg/kg), and the effects in the therapeutic group at 2 hours after infection were better than those in the therapeutic group after12 hours. Thus, we proposed that the histopathological changes in the lungs were associated with the doses and course of MCA1. In conclusion, MCA1 suppressed MERS-CoV replication and reduced inflammatory responses to certain degrees. These findings could be applied in future clinical studies. Previous studies have shown that neutralizing mAbs primarily target the RBD of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein. The DPP4binding site on the viral RBD can be separated into 2 major binding patches [49] . Structural analysis of the MCA1/MERS-CoV RBD interactions revealed a binding interface almost completely encompassing both patches on the RBD. Among these residues, W535 primarily bound to G91 of the light chain, and other residues involved in interactions with the heavy chain of MCA1. Moreover, residues Y540, R542, and Q544 on the RBD formed the hydrophobic cavity and interacted with the surrounding MCA1 residues G98, D99, T100, and S28 of the heavy chain. It is plausible that MCA1 forms hydrogen bonds with the epitopes on the RBD and occupies the binding sites for DPP4, interfering with viral recognition of the human cellular receptor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1152, "end": 1156, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, MCA1 completely inhibits MERS-CoV replication in nonhuman primates in both prophylactic and therapeutic treatments.
