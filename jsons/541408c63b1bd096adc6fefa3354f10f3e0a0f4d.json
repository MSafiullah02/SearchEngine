            "text": "The outbreak of the 2019-novel-coronavirus-disease (COVID- 19) caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerging from Wuhan in December 2019 has been arousing great global health concern, with many unknowns regarding the transmission dynamics and spectrum of illness to be answered. 1 -3 SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan, where imported cases with ascertained COVID-19 among travelers returning from Wuhan without direct exposure to any wet-markets or wild-animals have been reported. 2 -4 Current epidemiologic data indicate that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly occurring. 2 , 5 , 6 The great number of COVID-19 infections may be attributable to the late identification of sources-of-infection and the ability of the host to shed the infection while asymptomatic. 1 , 7 While a study 8 suggests that transmission may occur during the incubation-period, the validity was questioned by Science because the evidence was not directly obtained from the infectious-patient, who actually had developed symptoms, which were controlled by a fever-lowering agent, before disease transmission to others. 9 Published reports 2 , 10 , 11 focused on hospitalized older patients in Wuhan, many of whom had a history of exposure to the Huanan-Seafood-Wholesale-Market, and suggested that COVID-19 mainly affected older adults with frequent chronic comorbidities, and that many of them developed severe pneumonia, for whom organ dysfunction and failure and death can occur. However, the characteristics and infectivity of COVID-19 among youngsters have been rarely reported, and information on SARS-CoV-2-negative close-contacts, patients with mild infections, or those with infections outside Wuhan remains limited.",

SARS-CoV-2 tested positive in six of the 15 young classmates Patient-Index contacted in the get-together when he was totally asymptomatic, with the minimal exposure-duration of only two hours. The attack-rate is high (40%). The symptoms of Patients-4 and 8 developed on the same day as that of Patient-Index. We carefully had interviews directly with both Patient-Index himself and all the other contacts to confirm the absence of any symptoms of Patient-Index before and during the contacts, thus ascertaining the transmission during asymptomatic-phase. We may need to pay special attention to preventing COVID-19 transmission from people looking asymptomatic but with exposure-history. The incubationperiod and serial-interval in this young cluster were much shorter than previously-reported for majorly older patients at the earlier stage of the epidemic. 1 Infected-youngsters may act as important sources-of-infection. Notably, Patient-6 remained afebrile throughout the diseasecourse. These cryptic cases of walking-SARS-CoV-2-infection might act as potential sources to propagate the epidemic. Since it is difficult to differentiate and screen patients during the incubationperiod, further studies on the popularity of this transmissionpattern and the epidemiological-significance of cases with null or mild symptoms are warranted, which would help make relevant control-measures to prevent the future spread of infection. It may be needed to commit sufficient resources to examination in outpatient-clinics and emergency-departments for proactive caseidentification, both as part of the containment-strategy in locations without local-spread yet and to permit earlier clinical-management of infected-individuals.",
