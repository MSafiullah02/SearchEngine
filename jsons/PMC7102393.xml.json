Influenza A H7N9 is a triple reassortant virus [1]. In contrast to the common clinical features of patients infected with other H7 subtype viruses, those infected with H7N9 rapidly develop lower respiratory tract illness [2\u20135]. In many cases of H7N9 influenza, the health status of the patients can rapidly deteriorate into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, ultimately progressing to death. The spectrum of H7N9 infections remains unclear as epidemiological data are still limited. Prior 30 May 2013, 132 cases had been diagnosed worldwide, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of up to 28.03 % (37/132) [6]. An efficient treatment strategy to reduce the CFR is therefore urgently sought in China.",

The patient\u2019s temperature dropped to 36.2 \u00b0C 18 h after the initiation of treatment with oseltamivir. Cough and other symptoms alleviated rapidly.

Given the rapid progression of the illness in the previously reported H7N9 infected patients [1], ARDS was expected to occur if the causative agent and appropriate cause of treatment were not identified rapidly. A rapid influenza A antigen test was performed 15 h after the fever began, and the positive result precipitated early application of oseltamivir. Maximal plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite of oselatamivir, occur approximately 3\u20134 h after administration. The plasma half-life of OC is 6\u201310 h, which enables a twice-daily dosing regimen [8, 9]. Our index case recovered rapidly and did not develop ARDS, an outcome which may be attributed to the early administration of oseltamivir (15 h after onset of fever). The pharyngeal swab collected from the index case tested negative 30 h after treatment with oseltamivir.",
