Careful questioning about the history of both the individual and the group amongst which it is kept should provide most of the available information. A knowledge of the demeanour of the normal animal is essential before conclusions about abnormalities can be drawn. Rats, for example, spend most of the daylight hours curled up with their heads tucked under their abdomens. Hamsters and gerbils build quite elaborate nests and will be extremely difficult to observe when resting. Mice usually nest only when rearing young but, if kept in groups will, like rats, curl up together in a corner of the box. Guinea-pigs, if exposed to sudden unfamiliar sounds, will freeze for up to 20 min (Miller & Murray, 1966) but sudden movements will cause them to flee. They will scatter in different directions if a hand is quickly put into their box.",

There are numerous intestinal parasites in the different species; Table 3 gives a list of the more common ones. Only a few deserve special mention here. Heavy infestations of Hexamita and Giardia species (flagellates) may be responsible for diarrhoea, emaciation and death in mice (Sebesteny, 1969) and hamsters. The load of these organisms may be reduced by adding metronidazole to the diet. The disease called 'wet-tail' in hamsters may be caused by these organisms. It is almost certain, however, that this condition is merely a manifestation of enteric disturbance which may have a number of different causes. The cestode Hymenolepis nunu is unusual in having a direct life cycle. Very heavy infections in mice and hamsters may lead to diarrhoea and unthriftiness.

Ketosis, also regarded as a 'pregnancy toxaemia' is a disease that is characteristic of old, obese, females in late pregnancy (Ganaway & Allen, 1971 ). Avitaminosis C, other nutritional factors and stress all play a part in the aetiology of this condition. Strict attention to diet, particularly to prevent obesity, will reduce the incidence of ketosis. Dystocia and stillbirth may be due to ketosis but foetal oversize is another common cause usually when the sow is carrying only one foetus. The guinea-pig neonate is an unusually large and relatively mature animal. This feature can result in preparturient uterine torsion and post parturient caecal torsion, particulary if the sow is subjected to rough handling; death follows rapidly.",
