Highly pathogenic AIV strains are associated with high morbidity and mortality, leading to epidemics and substantial economic losses. For example, in early 2006, a highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV resulted in high mortality at chicken farms in Egypt. The first human case occurred shortly afterwards. Since then, the WHO has reported more than one hundred avian-transmitted AIV human infections and a number of deaths in Egypt [1].",

            "text": "The genetic and phenotypic diversity and the divergence of influenza viruses pose a technological challenge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. AIVs are divided into subtypes according to the antigenic properties of their haemagglutinin (HA, H1-H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9) surface glycoproteins. The only avian subtypes that are reported to cause disease in humans are H5, H7 and H9. The most well-known highly pathogenic avian subtype is H5N1 [2], although the newly reported subtype H7N9 has recently attracted attention. Based on genetic evidence, most influenza strains are traced to aquatic birds. Wild birds are believed to act as \u2018reservoirs\u2019 for these viruses, which cause little or no disease in the wild hosts. However, due to genetic mutations or re-assortment, these strains can become highly pathogenic and adapt to new host species, such as chickens, pigs and humans. Chickens and pigs have been shown to act as \u2018mixing vessels\u2019 for different influenza strains, facilitating genetic re-assortment of the highly pathogenic strains, which have resulted in severe disease pandemics in humans [3], [4], [5], [6]. Changes in the host, environment, or vector can lead to an increased incidence of viral infection. Many of the viral diseases that have appeared in the last few decades have now become entrenched in human populations worldwide. Some important known examples are Zika virus, monkey pox virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Hendra virus, Chikungunya virus, Hantavirus, Nipah virus, and the threat of pandemic influenza viruses of avian or swine origin. Changes in climate, the ecosystem and human activities are major factors for pathogen transmission. In particular, the high genetic biodiversity of wild birds combined with the low genetic biodiversity of the domestic bird population promotes the rapid dissemination of the infection in dense farms and live poultry markets [4], [7], [8], [9]. Unfortunately, the techniques used to detect AIV are not sufficiently developed for the present need. Antiviral therapies have been improved, but display a wide margin of ineffectiveness; therefore, new antiviral agents and improved detection techniques are urgently required to continue the fight against the invading viruses and modulate host responses.",

Intensive surveillance of avian influenza in farms, markets and among workers in the agriculture and food industries is a current urgent and unmet need. Improved diagnostic tools with increased sensitivity, high throughput and multiplexing abilities are required. Recent advances in nanotechnology provide several solutions, including high sensitivity, specificity and testing throughput. The present review aims to provide a detailed description of advanced nanotechnological methods that are currently being used to control AIV. The number of papers published in the application of nanotechnologies to avian influenza in the last decade is shown in Fig. 1\naccording to the year of publication. Recent developments in the use of nanotechnology in biosensors and detection systems and their applicability in AIV diagnostics are explored here and presented with a discussion of probable future trends.",

In contrast, AIV typing microarray tests can detect and provide additional information about the subtype detected in positive clinical samples compared with that obtained using real-time-PCR [20]. Lab-on-a-chip and fully integrated techniques have been developed for pathotyping and the phylogenetic characterization of influenza A viruses obtained from real samples [21]. Various types of ELISAs, including immunochromatographic strip tests [22] and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) [23], have been widely used for the rapid detection of subtype H9 influenza viruses and receptor binding specificity in different types of samples. DAS-ELISA uses two monoclonal antibodies with 99.1% specificity and 93.1% sensitivity. Dual-function and blocking ELISAs are highly sensitive and 100% specific for a timely diagnosis of AIV infections. These tests represent valid alternatives to the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, mainly for the screening of a large number of samples, as these tests are as sensitive and specific as the HI test but are faster and easier to automate [24], [25]. A magnetic immunofluorescence assay with an optical fibre spectrometer and a portable microfluidics chip was also reported for AIV detection [26].",

With the recent advances in nanotechnology, nanomaterials have received great interest in the biosensor field due to their exquisite sensitivity in chemical and biological reactions. Various types of NPs, including metal NPs, oxide NPs, semiconductor NPs, and even nanodimensional conducting polymers, have been used in biosensors [33]. Nanomaterials have divergent roles in the biosensors used for AIV (Fig. 2\n); however, these roles are mainly classified as: 1) the immobilization of target biomolecules; 2) catalysis of electrochemical reactions; 3) enhancement of electron transfer; 4) labelling of biomolecules or 5) reactants. All these applications somehow result in improvements in speed, selectiveness and specificity, which are critical for disease control and monitoring [34].",

            "text": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), inter alia, became very popular as novel fluorescent probes used for biological detection applications with respect to their high quantum yield and molar extinction coefficients, which are 10- to 100-fold larger than most organic dyes [35], [36]. The application of metallic NPs, particularly noble metal (gold and silver)-based NPs, to virus detection has progressed. Another promising group of materials with considerably low detection limits for sensing AIV are fluorescent biosensors based on metal organic frameworks [37]. Magnetic beads or nanobeads are used to detect the amplified signals. Together with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) aptasensors, the magnetic nanobead-amplified QCM immunosensors have been used to detect the H5N1 protein [38]. Magnetic particles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and carbon-based materials are frequently used to assay and detect influenza viruses. Many of these particles are commercially available and/or were prepared using published procedures, with some modifications [39], [40], [41], [42]. In particular, AuNPs are widely employed for developing biosensors due to their exceptional electrochemical properties [43]. Schemes using nanoparticle-based biosensors for the detection of AIV proteins are shown in Fig. 3\n. In addition to these NPs, some other nanomaterial-based techniques, including nanowell array electrode-based electrochemical quantitative systems [44] and fully integrated on-chip tubular nanomembrane sensors [45], have also been developed to efficiently detect viral DNA. The next sections provide a brief discussion of new trends and approaches in the field of AIV detection.",

The crucial step is the fabrication of an electrode surface that enables a significant increase in the amount of immobilized recognition probes and promotes high sensitivity and selectivity towards the target molecules. In accordance with this requirement, glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) are decorated with CdSe hollow microspheres together with a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe. This reagent exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting avian influenza RNA segments [54]. In our laboratory, we have also designed a hybridization probe consisting of paramagnetic particles and QDs with a targeted DNA for the detection of AIV (H5N1).

A novel electrochemical magneto-immunosensor based on the connection between immunomagnetic separation and catalytic enzyme-based amplification in combination with a biotin-streptavidin system rapidly and ultrasensitively detects H9N2 AIV [59]. Moreover, immunogenic nanobeads, which were modified with a monoclonal HA-specific antibody in combination with QDs, were used to detect the virus without pretreating the sample through the high-affinity biotin-streptavidin system in an immune sandwich mode [60]. Another approach demonstrating highly sensitive AIV antigen detection takes advantage of resonance light scattering (RLS). In the presence of AIV antigens, an increase in RLS signal intensity is observed at 545 nm. Changes in the signal intensity are caused by the formation of an immunocomplex between the AIV antigen and magnetic silica NPs modified with covalently bound AIV antibodies [61]. Magnetic nanobeads with a 30 nm diameter decorated with immobilized anti-H5 antibodies were used to more efficiently capture H5N1 viruses and in subsequent detection processes using QCM. The immunosensors, which use polyclonal antibodies against the HA surface antigen on H5N1 AIV, were bound to gold atoms located at the QCM crystal surface via a self-assembled single layer of 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid, which causes a change in frequency [62]. A lower detection limit and greater specificity for H5N1 screening were achieved due to the amplification of the impedance signal when chicken red blood cells were used for biolabelling [63]. In a subsequent study, immunomagnetic nanoparticles were used for virus separation in combination with a microfluidics chip and an interdigitated microelectrode for impedance measurements. Modification of the NPs with H5N1 aptamers facilitated the capture of whole H5N1 virions. Subsequent binding to concanavalin A/glucose oxidase-AuNP bionanocomposites resulted in the formation of a complex, which was detected using enzyme catalysis after treatment with glucose [64]. Off-line magnetic bioseparation of H5N2 virions from tracheal and cloacal swabs from infected chickens and the subsequent utilization of a microfluidics impedance biosensor achieved comparable sensitivity and selectivity to real-time RT-PCR with a detection time of less than 1 h. Biotin-labelled anti-H5 antibodies conjugated to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used for virion separation [65]. An electrochemical magneto-immunoassay coupled to biometallization and anodic stripping voltammetry is the basic principle of a highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for H7N9 AIV. This approach allowed the accumulation of product generated by the enzymatic reaction on the surface of a magneto electrode through silver deposition [66]. Paramagnetic particles with a nanomaghemite core (\u03b3-Fe2O3) functionalized with tetraethyl orthosilicate and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane on the NP surface exhibited the ability to bind H7N7 influenza virions. The immobilized virions were directly and sequentially analysed using ion-exchange chromatography and visible spectrophotometry (VIS) [67].",

For example, Diba and colleagues developed an amperometric system with an AuNP-modified electrode to detect H5N1 viral proteins [43]. AuNPs were electrodeposited onto working carbon electrodes using a solution containing HAuCl4 and the surface was functionalized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid before an H5N1 aptamer was spread over the chip surface and the entire chip was washed with PBS [43]. AIV-specific aptamers were also conjugated with AuNPs to detect whole viruses [68]. AuNPs are used to dramatically amplify the detected signals [69]. Several studies have been performed to develop AuNP-based immunosensors to detect AIV HA [70], [71]. An immunosensor for the detection of peptides derived from AIV H5 HA was described by Jarocka et al. The gold electrode was modified with 1,6-hexanedithiol, AuNPs and then with anti-HA H5 monoclonal antibody MAb 6-9-1 antibody-binding fragments (Fab') via S-Au covalent bonds. The interactions between the Fab' fragments and HA were detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the presence of an [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 marker [71]. In another study, streptavidin-coated AuNPs were used to identify influenza H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 strains. The purified streptavidin was mixed with an AuNP solution and prepared using the citrate method [72].",

Amino oligonucleotides were covalently bonded to poly(ethylenimine)-modified BaGdF5:Yb/Er NPs, whereas the thiol-modified oligonucleotides with H7 HA gene sequences were conjugated to AuNPs [73]. Different colourimetric biosensors have recently been developed for the detection of different AIV subtypes [53], [74], [75], [76]. A facile colourimetric assay was developed to assess the interactions between viral HA proteins and host glycan receptors using glycan-functionalized AuNPs (gAuNPs). The gAuNPs were prepared from citrate AuNPs by the addition of disulphide-modified sialic acid receptors in methanol with stirring at room temperature for 24 h [74]. Another colourimetric assay based on enzyme-induced metallization was proposed for the detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP); it was further applied to the highly sensitive detection of AIV particles coupled with immunomagnetic separation. In this case, glutathione-capped 6 nm AuNPs were used [75]. The colourimetric detection of influenza virus using an immunosensor is also possible without enzymatic reactions for the fast and simple detection of viruses. AuNPs modified with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies are used in this type of immunosensor. The virus has multiple recognition sites for the AuNP-antibody probes on its surface, which causes the probes to be specifically arranged on the surface of the virus. This aggregation of the probes causes plasmon coupling between adjacent AuNPs, which in turn results in a red shift in the absorption spectrum. A change in colour from red to purple is detected very easily with the naked eye [76].",

The glycoNPs consisted of the sialic acid derivative and a thiolated polyethylene glycol that self-assembled onto the gold surface. These glycoNPs were able to distinguish between human (\u03b1-2,6 binding) and avian (\u03b1-2,3 binding) RG14 (H5N1) influenza viruses [78]. Gold immunochromatographic strips can enhance the detection sensitivity by inducing AuNP clustering around immunogold particles immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. AuNPs additionally provide an intense signal that is visible with the naked eye [24].

The GBP-fusion method allows the proteins to be immobilized in their bioactive forms, facilitating the study of antigen-antibody interactions [80]. Western blotting (or immunoblotting) is often used to detect specific proteins in a mixture of other proteins, such as in a tissue homogenate or other biological samples, for the diagnosis of infectious diseases in humans and animals. An improved technique was also reported where AuNPs were used to avoid the diffusion of the conserved peptide from avian influenza nonstructural protein from the membrane [81]. AuNPs were employed to coat an immobilin-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. AuNPs bind to the sulphhydryl and amine groups of amino acids, but small molecules are retained on the metal membrane. The diffusion of the desired peptides and small protein molecules to the metal-coated membrane is avoided during Western blotting. This technique has become useful for detecting small proteins or peptides. In a separate study, a nanoporous gold film was used in a bio-nanogate-controlled enzymatic reaction system to detect the virus [82].",

However, these problems might provide an opportunity for AIV to acquire efficient human-to-human transmission, causing morbidity and mortality in human populations. Thus, the development of a rapid and expansive global influenza surveillance and response network and strategies to effectively decrease the global transmission of this disease is important. The key to solve this issue is the development of new technologies and improvements in current technologies for the detection and treatment of this disease. The development of existing and new diagnostic techniques will provide researchers the opportunity to rapidly detect influenza viruses. For example, one-step RT-PCR enables the rapid and accurate identification of potential zoonosis subtypes, i.e., H5, H7, and H9 [103]. Moreover, linear-after-exponential PCR represents a sensitive amplification assay that includes increased levels of multiplexing and rapid DNA sequencing of the amplicons without purification. Light-upon-extension RT-PCR provides a simple detection method that uses two primers, one of which is labelled with a fluorophore molecule, and generates a melting curve for analysis upon completion of the amplification reactions [104]. Microarrays and DNA chips represent techniques for the detection of large numbers of genetic elements after hybridization with target probes based on high density arrays. Some new technologies that enable the easy and rapid detection of proteins or nucleic acids and improved detection of the influenza virus include liquid-phase microarrays using luminex technology combined with flow cytometry and fluorescent microspheres. The proximity ligation assay labels proteins via nucleic acid amplification, which increases the potential utility of this method in detecting influenza viruses. This method is based on antibody-mediated recognition of viral or bacterial surface proteins that are coupled with DNA [105].",

NGS also provides valuable information on the expression profile of the host during infection [108], bringing us closer to an understanding of pathogen-host interactions. The critical capacity of influenza virus for human-to-human transfer is not well-understood but has been documented on several occasions. This critical point will be easily overcome in the near future, likely leading to an increase in cross-species transfer to the spread of influenza viruses [109]. We believe that the genetic compatibility between species will play a major role in cross-species influenza transfer. Therefore, the collection of genetic information from hosts and pathogens will provide insights towards a better understanding of disease transfer in the future.",

Due to their properties (chemical, physical and electronic), nanomaterials should provide excellent tools for the early detection, early warning and effective treatment of disease threats. The modification of electro-analytical analyser with various nanomaterials will ensure large effective surface areas, high catalytic capabilities and high conductivities using transducers as effective mediators. This strategy will enable the transfer of electrons between the receptor active site and the electrode and rapid AIV detection. The modification of various fluorescent QDs with virus-specific antibodies or oligonucleotides will enable the highly sensitive and rapid detection of antigens (present in samples) using fluorescent readout signals, which can be detected using immunoassays, PCR methods or high resolution microscopy [111]. The simple chemical synthesis of AuNPs and possibilities for surface modification with different molecules, such as peptides, proteins, DNA and antibodies, should provide researchers additional opportunities to improve virus detection in the future. Due to their surface plasmon resonance properties, AuNPs aggregate, which leads to colour changes in solution the potential for the rapid and simple detection of influenza viruses [112].
