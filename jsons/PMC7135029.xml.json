The most common cause is reactive hyperplasia resulting from an infectious process, most commonly a viral upper respiratory tract infection (Peters & Edwards, 2000). Upper respiratory tract infection might be caused by rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, or reovirus. Other viruses associated with cervical lymphadenopathy include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, rubella, rubeola, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), coxsackievirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Bacterial cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. Anaerobic bacteria can cause cervical lymphadenitis, usually in association with dental caries and periodontal disease. Group B streptococci and Haemophilus influenzae type b are less frequent causal organisms. Diphtheria is a rare cause. Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease), atypical mycobacteria, and mycobacteria are important causes of subacute or chronic cervical lymphadenopathy (Spyridis, Maltezou, & Hantzakos, 2001). Chronic posterior cervical lymphadenitis is the most common form of acquired toxoplasmosis and is the sole presenting symptom in 50% of cases (Leung & Robson, 1991).Cervical masses are common in children and might be mistaken for enlarged cervical lymph nodes.\nBOX 1Causes of cervical lymphadenopathy\nAInfection1.Viral\u25e6Viral upper respiratory infection\u25e6Epstein-Barr virus\u25e6Cytomegalovirus\u25e6Rubella\u25e6Rubeola\u25e6Varicella-zoster virus\u25e6Herpes simplex\u25e6Coxsackievirus\u25e6Human immunodeficiency virus\n2.Bacterial\u25e6Staphylococcus aureus\u25e6Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci\u25e6Anaerobes\u25e6Diphtheria\u25e6Cat-scratch disease\u25e6Tuberculosis\n3.Protozoal\u25e6Toxoplasmosis\n\nBMalignancies1.Neuroblastoma2.Leukemia3.Lymphoma4.Rhabdomyosarcoma\nCMiscellaneous1.Kawasaki disease2.Collagen vascular diseases3.Serum sickness4.Drugs5.Postvaccination6.Rosai-Dorfman disease7.Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease\n\nData from Leung & Robson (1991).",

Generalized lymphadenopathy might be a feature of systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or serum sickness. Certain drugs, notably phenytoin and isoniazid, might cause generalized lymphadenopathy (Malley, 2000). Cervical lymphadenopathy has been reported following immunization with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, poliomyelitis, or typhoid fever vaccine (Leung & Robson, 1991). Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign form of histiocytosis characterized by generalized proliferation of sinusoidal histiocytes. The disease usually manifests in the first decade of life with massive and painless cervical lymphadenopathy and is often accompanied by fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (Swartz, 2000). Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (necrotizing lymphadenitis) is a benign cause of lymphadenopathy that primarily affects young Japanese females. Fever, nausea, weight loss, night sweats, arthralgia, or hepatosplenomegaly might be present.",
