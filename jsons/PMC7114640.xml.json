            "text": "Earthquake is one of the most common natural disasters that are usually unpredictable, uncontrollable, and may cause great loss of life and property. Although it has been extensively evidenced that psychiatric disorders are prevalent in earthquake survivors, especially in children and adolescents (Davidson and McFarlane, 2006, Furr et al., 2010), previous research has also indicated that there are highly variable psychopathological reactive responses among earthquake survivors (Bonanno et al., 2010, Norris et al., 2002), and that the occurrence possibility of depression following earthquake among different populations varies in a wide range (Ek\u015fi et al., 2007, Goenjian et al., 2011, Qu et al., 2012, Sharan et al., 1996). Yet, up till now, limited research has used growth mixture modeling or similar statistical techniques to explore the possible patterns of time-course depression trajectories among earthquake survivors. There are longitudinal studies that demonstrated the existence of heterogeneous time-course trajectories of psychiatric symptoms (including depressive symptoms) following traumatic experiences such as breast cancer (Deshields, Tibbs, Fan, & Taylor, 2006), severe acute respiratory syndrome (Bonanno et al., 2008), severe physical injury (deRoon-Cassini, Mancini, Rusch, & Bonanno, 2010), and exposure to war (Bonanno, Mancini et al., 2012). In general, these studies observed four patterns of growth trajectories for post-traumatic psychiatric symptoms: 1) chronic dysfunction (i.e., prolonged severe symptoms); 2) recovery (i.e., initial moderate to severe symptoms followed by a gradual relief); 3) delayed dysfunction (i.e., postponed outbreak of severe symptoms); and 4) resilience (i.e., stable minimal or no symptoms). However, it remains relatively unclear about the heterogeneity in the long-term course of depressive symptoms following earthquake. Our prior study collected four waves of data from a large sample of Chinese adolescents exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, subsequently at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months after the disaster, and reported the time-varying changes of depressive symptoms of the whole sample, without examining individual variation in developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms (Ye, Fan, Li, & Han, 2014). Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to include data from further follow-up and identify the latent growth curves of post-earthquake depression in Chinese adolescent earthquake survivors.",

One drawback existing in previous studies is that they mostly used the cross-sectional design, thus making it difficult to understand whether the predictive validities of these factors would be different for different people at different time points after earthquake. Only a few studies have longitudinally investigated the time-varying relationships between these predictors and post-earthquake depression. For example, Ye et al. (2014) reported that whereas loss/injury of family members and direct witness of tragic scenes during the earthquake could account for higher risk of adolescents' depression from 6 to 18 months following the earthquake, they could not predict adolescents' depression from 18 to 24 months following the earthquake. However, there is a dearth of research regarding the association of these predictors to the cluster membership of depression growth trajectories, i.e. whether and how these predictors are differently related to different clusters of depression growth trajectories. Accordingly, the present study also intended to contribute to the literature by addressing this issue.",

As compared with previous studies that estimated depression prevalence in other samples who survived from the Wenchuan earthquake, prevalence rates of depressive symptoms reported in this study were relatively lower. For example, in a study by Cheng et al. (2015), a sample of 182 temporary settlement residents reported a depression prevalence rate of 48.9% at 12-months after the earthquake. Another study (Liu, Fan, & Liu, 2013) investigated 155 bereaved parents in this disaster and found that 65.8% and 44.5% of them respectively endorsing depression at 18- and 24-months post-earthquake. These discrepant estimates may be due to demographic variation across samples, different severities of samples' earthquake exposure, or different measures of depressive symptoms. The current results also showed that the prevalence rates of depressive symptoms tended to be higher at 12- and 24-months, indicating an \u201canniversary effect\u201d.

The majority of the sample (68.4% for resilience) were euthymic across time. This is consistent with previous studies that explored the heterogeneity in depressive trajectories following traumatic experiences other than earthquake (Bonanno et al., 2012a, Bonanno et al., 2008, deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010, Deshields et al., 2006). For example, one study (Bonanno, Kennedy, Galatzer-Levy, Lude, & Elfstr\u00f6m, 2012) longitudinally followed 233 patients suffering from spinal cord injury for 2 years and found that most of them were euthymic. These studies together with our results suggest that most people can have good adaptation to real-life traumatic events. In contrast with the resilience cluster, consistent with recent meta-analyses (Bonanno et al., 2010), about one fourth of the current sample exhibited chronic depression (25.6%). Two other growth curves revealed in the current sample were delayed depression (4.3%) and recovery (1.7%). These patterns have been commonly observed in aforementioned studies regarding the developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms post-trauma. It should be noted, however, that the proportions of our sample showing these two patterns were relatively lower than those in past studies. For example, Bonanno, Kennedy et al. (2012) reported that delayed depression and recovery respectively comprised 9.8% and 13.3% of the 233 spinal cord-injured patients. Also, deRoon-Cassini et al. (2010) followed 330 physical injury victims for six months and found that 17% and 14% of them showed delayed depression and recovery, respectively. These inconsistent proportions might be attributable to differences in sample demographics, trauma types, duration and frequency of the follow-up, instruments used to evaluate the depressive symptoms, the definition of significant depressive symptomatology, as well as the presence and the extent of risk/protective factors across studies.",

Greater severity of earthquake exposure increases the risk for post-earthquake depression (Armenian et al., 2002, Qu et al., 2012, Sharan et al., 1996). Consistent with these findings, our study found that direct witness of tragic scenes during the earthquake could put adolescent survivors at higher risk for chronic depression. As for gender, our data showed an association between male gender and decreased probability of chronicity and recovery in relation to resilience. That is, female gender was related with decreased probability of resilience. Previous studies have pointed out that females rather than males are more prone to post-earthquake depression (Goenjian et al., 2011, Sharan et al., 1996). However, these studies were mainly cross-sectional and only examined the gender effect on depressive symptoms at one point in time after earthquake. Unlike these studies, the current study explored how gender was related to distinct growth curves of depressive symptoms and demonstrated that females were less likely to maintain euthymia in the post-earthquake adaptation process.",

Having more negative life events at 6-months after the earthquake significantly increased the probability of developing chronicity and recovery patterns. Prior studies have reported that individuals' mental health after a disaster may be more susceptible to post-disaster negative life events rather than the disaster per se (Freedy, Saladin, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Saunders, 1994). Negative life events could by themselves aggravate adolescents' post-earthquake stress reactions and increase the ongoing daily hassles, which could in turn have strong adverse impact on their mental health status. As for social support, chronic depression was associated with fewer social support at 6-months. The recovery pattern could be accounted for by fewer social support at 6-months and greater social support at 24-months. Conversely, greater social support at 6-months and fewer social support at 24-months could increase the risk for delayed depression. As the literature (Armenian et al., 2002, Xu et al., 2013), these findings suggest that social support may be a protective factor against depression after traumatic experiences. Social support might promote recovery from depression by buffering the negative impact of traumatic experiences and subsequent daily-life adversity on people's psychological wellbeing.",

In addition, self-report measures could provide an insight into how one perceives his/her own mental status, which serves as a basis of clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Second, data were collected in school settings, making it difficult to continue the follow-up after the participants graduated from the selected schools. To extend the follow-up period as long as possible, only 7th and 10th grade students were included for this study, so that they can be tracked for at least two years before their graduation. Finally, we could not administrate assessments immediately after the earthquake, because during the first 6 months after the earthquake we applied for ethical approval for the study and data collection could not start until the ethical approval had been obtained. Despite the lack of data during the first 6 months, our study had been carefully designed and organized and thus was able to follow a large sample of adolescents for over two years after the earthquake.",

The results could inform mental health professionals regarding the identification of adolescents who are at risk of chronic depressive symptoms post-earthquake and are possibly having exacerbation of their depressive symptoms during the anniversary dates. Providing individualized mental health services and interventions for adolescent earthquake survivors particularly those with significant clinical depression is indicated.",
