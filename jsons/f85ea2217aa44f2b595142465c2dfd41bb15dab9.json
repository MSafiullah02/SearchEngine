Methods: We prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical features, laboratory data and outcomes of 7 newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women in Zhongnan Results: 4 of the 7 newborns were late preterm with gestational age between 36 weeks and 37 weeks, and the other 3 were full-term infants. The average birth weight was 2096 \u00b1 660 g. All newborns were born without asphyxia. 2 premature infants performed mild grunting after birth, but relieved rapidly with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) ventilation. 3 cases had chest X-ray, 1 was normal and 2 who were supported by nCPAP presented mild neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Samples of pharyngeal swab in 6 cases, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood in 4 cases were tested by qRT-PCR, and there was no positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in all cases. Conclusions: The current data show that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnant women does not cause adverse outcomes in their newborns, however, it is necessary to separate newborns from mothers immediately to avoid the potential threats.",

            "text": "In this group of data, most pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed symptoms of infection before delivery. As little is known to the virus at the early stage of outbreak, most of the newborns were born by planned cesarean delivery to prevent transmission to newborns. Two newborns were separated from their mothers after birth and taken home by healthy family members at their request. 5 newborns were admitted to the NICU, of which 2 newborns developed mild respiratory distress after birth, and were given nCPAP-assisted ventilation.3 newborns had stable breathing and didn't require any respiratory support. All newborns were not treated with any antiviral drugs. The newborns that stayed in NICU had no abnormal signs during the monitoring of breathing, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. There was no abnormal manifestation in digestion, urination, defecation, and mental reactions during hospitalization. Complete blood counts taken on the first and third day of birth did not indicate obvious abnormal, all indicators were consistent with the normal range of newborns of the same gestational age and same day of age. Some newborns' MYO and CK-MB were higher than normal values. Coagulation indexes showed that some neonatal D-dimers were higher than normal values. Although Shek and colleagues have reported that SARS-CoV cannot be transmitted from infected mothers to newborns [11] , it can aggravate the clinical outcomes of mothers and newborns. Our observation demonstrated that the condition of infants was not aggravated after their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and we have also commented that compared to infected adults, the condition of infected children is significantly milder, with faster recovery, shorter virus shedding time and better prognosis [7] . However, one newborn in our department who was born to mother with suspected COVID-19 presented hematochezia recently, so it is still necessary to accumulate more clinical data for further understanding of maternal infection's influence on the newborn.",

In addition, the number of cases was limited, and the observation time was short. Despite of this, we should strengthen the monitoring of mother-to-child transmission, and further accumulation and detailed research are still needed.",
