            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory pathogen, which typically infects the airway epithelium [1]. Those infected with RSV, usually infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients but also healthy adults [2,3], develop mild to severe cough and dyspnea [4]. Wheezing and asthma symptoms are observed following severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection [5]. RSV infection occur frequently in the respiratory tract of individuals with an underlying lung disease, such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6]. A range of inflammatory responses are associated with RSV infection, such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, such as GRO\u03b1/CXCL1, IL-1\u03b2, IL1-RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, CCL5/RANTES, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), GM-CSF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [1,7-16]. The importance of this cytokine response is underscored by the fact that increased levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, EGF and HGF are associated with RSV infection severity [10,15]. Others have found that SNPs in IL-19, IL-20, MUC5AC, TNFRSF1B, C3, CTLA4, CXCL9, IL4R, and IL-7 genes are associated with recurrent wheezing following RSV infections [17]. Although RSV-induced cytokines have been studied extensively, the signaling mechanisms that regulate their expression and whether specific host cytokines contribute to airway injury or inflammation resolution remain incompletely understood.",

            "text": "Pathological studies demonstrate that RSV primarily infects airway epithelial cells [18]; therefore it is conceivable that a significant component of immune signaling associated with RSV infections originates from airway epithelial responses. Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are expressed in these cells in response to microbial stimuli [19,20] with numerous pathogen recognition receptors playing a major role in cytokine responses. Pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs and retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors [21], induce major signaling cascades following viral stimulation [22]. Indeed, the viral load of RSV correlates with RIG-I mRNA levels [23]. TLR3, \u22127, \u22128 and \u22129 recognize nucleic acid ligands but TLR4 proteins also bind to a major viral antigen of RSV F (fusion) protein [24]. Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and melanoma differentiation\u2013associated protein-5 (MDA5) equally could be associated with RSV-induced immune responses [25]. Additionally, ligands for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)-like receptors (NLR), such as NOD2, enhance TLR-ligand-induced activation and triggering such signaling cascades are plausible means of developing RSV-specific immunity [26]. Therefore, RSV can induce several pathogen recognition receptors resulting in multiple host immune responses.",

Normal human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and A549 cells were utilized to examine 42 cytokine responses following RSV stimuli. Several newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines (leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-\u03b2)) were induced in airways cells in vitro and in mouse lungs during a viral infection in vivo. The influence of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signaling pathways were examined on RSV-induced cytokine levels in mice and A549 cells. The significance of LIF, an IL-6 cytokine family member, expression during RSV was also determined. LIF is primarily recognized for its ability to preserve the totipotency of embryonic stem cells [27] and is detected in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [28] but recently LIF was described to protect the lung from injury during pneumonia [29]. Utilizing neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, LIF was observed to play a critical role in protecting the lung from injury during RSV infection. Our findings indicate that RSV infection induces a significant host cytokine response associated with viral clearance and airway protection.",

Protein array analysis identified that a large number of cytokines are released from A549 cells upon RSV stimuli (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The most striking RSV inducible cytokines were IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2, MIF, GRO\u03b1/CXCL1, and RANTES/CCL5 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). To complement the cytokine array analysis, multiplex analysis was performed to examine 42 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released from A549 cells, in addition to human SAE cells. Both SAE and A549 cells released similar cytokines in response to RSV infection (Table 1). In both A549 and SAE cells, RSV significantly induced IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, CCL11, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, CXCL10, CCL2, MIF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), TNF-\u03b1, VEGF, LIF, CCL27, CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF release into media. Interestingly, SAE cells also released IL-16, IL-18, CXCL9, CCL7 and HGF upon RSV stimulation. A549 cells differed to SAE cells in releasing IL-10, IL-12(p70), GM-CSF, CCL3, CCL4 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upon RSV stimulation. RSV-inducible cytokines were examined following stimulation with UV-inactivated RSV in A549 cells, to determine if cytokines are induced following viral detection or viral replication. RANTES/CCL5, CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2, CCL27, LIF, MIF, CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL2, IL-6, SCF, IL-7, TNF-\u03b1 and G-CSF were all secreted following stimuli with live RSV only (Figure 1). IL-8 and IFN- \u03b3 was secreted at significantly higher levels from UV-RSV treated cells compared to mock treated cells but at lower levels to live RSV (Figure 1A). Therefore, RSV replication induces a plethora of immune responses in airway epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Nasopharyngeal cells from infants with RSV infection have gene expression differences for MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8 [23]. Since RSV infection induces a large repertoire of host cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, several of the major pathogen recognition receptors were profiled in each cell type to determine the potential regulators of the immune response to RSV infection. Therefore, qPCR and immunoblots were performed for p-IRF3(ser396), IRF3, p-TBK1(ser172), TBK-1/NAK, RIG-I, LGP2, MDA5, MAVS, LGP2, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, Trif, MyD88, IRAK1, NOD2 and \u03b2-actin. The remaining TLR genes and other NOD genes (NOD1 and NLXR1) were also profiled in both cell types. A549 and SAE cells became readily infected with RSV 24 hours after incubation (Figure 3A) and had significant increases in RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, NOD2, Trif, TLR2 and TLR3 gene expression in both cell types (Figure 3B). TLR1, 6 and 10 gene expressions were also enhanced in SAE cells following RSV infection. TLR4 gene expression was increased in A549s cells. Protein profiles were analyzed for several of the receptors with the greatest gene induction with RSV infection, by immunoblots. Increased cellular protein levels of RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, Trif and TLR3 were observed by immunblotting in both A549 and SAE cells (Figure 3C). Utilizing densitometry analysis, no significant changes in NOD2 and TLR2 protein levels were observed in either A549 or SAE cells possibility due to lower induction of gene expression for these targets (Additional file 1: Figure S2). To investigate the activation status of receptors, downstream signaling transduction analysis was performed for the phosphorylation of IRF3, TBK1, degradation of IRAK1 and increased expression of Trif and MyD88. IRF3 and TBK1 underwent phosphorylation following RSV infection, confirming activation of these pathways (Figure 3C and Additional file 1: Figure S2). Equally, increases in Trif and decreased IRAK1 levels were observed after RSV challenge (Figure 3C and Additional file 1: Figure S2), further confirming that several receptors underwent activation. Due to the activation intensity of the RLR, activation of IRF3 and induction of the Trif/TLR3, in vivo studies were undertaken specifically examining the Trif and RLR pathways.",

Administration of anti-LIF IgG resulted in RSV-infected animals losing weight faster than control IgG treated littermates (Figure 6A). The total number of immune cells in the BALF was comparable between RSV treated groups (Figure 6B). However, BALF cells in the animals administered anti-LIF IgG were undergoing apoptosis at a greater rate than control IgG animals (Figure 6B). Inhibition of LIF signaling also subdued RSV induced airway hyperresponsiveness, demonstrated by respiratory system resistance (Rn) measurements during a methacholine dose challenge (Figure 6C). Anti-LIF IgG treated mice had significantly higher protein concentration (Figure 6D) in the BALF compared to infected control IgG treated mice, suggesting potentially increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier. Lung RSV burdens were not significantly affected by LIF blockade seven days following RSV challenge (Figure 6E). Lung cytokine gene expression was determined by qPCR and blocking LIF signaling resulted in enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 compared to control IgG treated mice, 7-days post RSV infection (Figure 6F).

Others and we demonstrate that a spectrum of cytokines is released to counter RSV infection [1,7-10,34] but further analysis is required to determine the role of these immune responses in RSV pathology. The results of this study demonstrate that RLRs and Trif signaling pathways play major roles in the immune response to RSV infection for both inflammation induction and resolution. Interestingly, 34 of the 42 cytokines examined in A549 and SAE cells were released upon RSV stimulation. This study highlights the robust epithelial responses to RSV infection, characterizes two major signaling cascade needed to counter viral infectivity and identified the role of LIF signaling during an RSV infection.",

            "text": "Many of the RSV-inducible cytokines described in this study have already been described in clinical samples, in vitro epithelial cell culture or in animals models [1,7-16], such as elevated MIG/CXCL9 levels in BALB/c mice inoculated with RSV [35]. Importantly, increases in media or mouse BALF IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL4/ MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and CCL5/RANTES following RSV infection reflects similar observations from clinical studies [10,36]. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify that RSV infection in epithelial cells and mice can induce MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF expression and secretions. This is an important finding as each new target can potentially play a different role in RSV clearance. MIF activates lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages and plays a key role in several host immune cell responses [37]. CTAK/CCL27 is a cytokine associated with T cell activation and migration [38] and is elevated in severe tuberculosis cases [39]. Recombinant protein SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 does not prevent RSV infection of Hep2 cells [40] but SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes [41] and contributes to pulmonary fibrosis [42]. The potential role of SCGF-\u03b2 in RSV infections is not as straightforward to elucidate but SCGF-\u03b2 can support growth of primitive hematopoietic cells [43] and can promotes proliferation of erythroid or myeloid progenitors. SCF and its soluble receptor c-kit correlate with asthma severity [44]. This study identified an important role for LIF in RSV infection. Therefore, identifying these new RSV inducible targets in clinical samples and their role in viral clearance may provide important insights into host responses to RSV infection.",

            "text": "Other investigators have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of LIF expression in other models of lung injury, as it protects against lung injury [29,32,33]. Recombinant LIF reduces cytokine expression [29] and alters alveolar neutrophil numbers [29,32]. Lif KO animals have increased expression of CXCL1, GM-CSF, RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 early during an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model and reduced CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10 at a later stage of the disease [45]. In this study neutralizing LIF signaling enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 at day 7 of an RSV infection. Therefore LIF expression has the potential to regulate key factors in the immune system. Targeted overexpression of LIF in mouse airway epithelial cells significantly protects the airways during hyperoxia, with improved survival and decreased pulmonary edema [33]. Other IL-6 family members (IL-6 [46] and IL-11 [47]) have similar functions, which suggest that IL-6 family cytokines may collectively protect lungs from injury. LIF is a prominent STAT3-activating cytokine that facilitates tissue protection during pneumonia [29] and plays a similar airway protective role during RSV infection. The significance of LIF expression and STAT3 activation in RSV infection represents an intriguing area for further study. LIF has been shown to regulate apoptosis with some investigators suggesting LIF acts as a pro-apoptotic mediator [48,49] while others have demonstrated LIF to have anti-apoptotic potential [50,51]. In this study increased apoptotic BAL cells were observed in animals administered anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection. Enhanced Fas, Fap, Il24, and Tnfsf15 expression is observed following LIF depletion in animals with bacterial pneumonia [29], which could contribute to the increased apoptosis observed here. Whether this induction of apoptosis contributes to the pathology observed in this study is unknown and requires further investigation. Epithelial damage correlates with airway hyperreactivity in asthma patients [52] and the increased protein levels in the BALF of animals treated with anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection could also contribute to the enhanced airway resistance observed in these animals. LIF enhances the maintenance of stem cells [27], which may directly impact lung tissue regeneration and repair [53], similar to IL-6 activation of STAT3 [54]. These data reveal the vast biological processes of LIF signaling during RSV infection. Whether the other cytokines identified in this study also play such major roles on disease pathology needs to be addressed.",

            "text": "Our study also reveals that Trif and RLR signaling regulate a significant proportion of the cytokines induced by RSV infection, with LIF expression sensitive to Trif activation. Prior to undertaking this study, several pathogen recognition receptors were associated with regulating the immune response against RSV infection, with RIG-I [55], TLR7 [56] and TLR3 [57] known to affect numerous cytokine responses. Several investigators characterized the RIG-I-like family proteins as critical for the detection of RSV, using human cell lines [30] and knockout mice [58]. RIG-I principally recognizes dsRNA [59]; however Sendai virus defective interfering RNA [60] and the genomic \u201cpanhandle\u201d structure of influenza virus [61] activate RLR signaling. These \u201cpanhandle\u201d structures allow negative-strand RNA viral genomes to achieve partially double-stranded RNA [62], which may allow RSV to induce RLRs. Our study observed early cytokine responses following RSV infection and identified a pronounced RIG-I response, which could be lost over time following NS1 or NS2 binding to RIG-I/MDA5 as reported by others [63,64]. Also, RSV induction of TLR3 is regulated by RIG-I-dependent IFN-\u03b2 secretions from infected epithelial cells, which is mediated by both IFN response-stimulated element (ISRE) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) sites in its proximal promoter [65]. Therefore there are multiple levels of RLRs regulation in RSV infections that can both trigger RLRs responses or subsequently adapt to block RLR-mediated signaling.",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are not secreted by RSV-infected well-defined bronchial epithelial cells [66], suggesting that there could be major signaling differences in well-defined primary cell culture techniques and monolayers. However, our overall findings suggest that utilizing cell monolayers in combination with mouse models is an acceptable approach as our cytokine profile are comparable to that observed in the human disease state [10]. In addition, our study has exposed new RSV inducible host immune response cytokines. Since we only explored epithelial cell responses in vitro, our in vivo parallel approach also validates our monolayer results and suggests that the epithelium is a significant source of initial immune responses following RSV infection.",

These findings also identified new cytokines that are triggered by RSV lung infection, with LIF signaling critical for the protection of the lung from injury during RSV infection. Profiling the loss and gain of the other identified cytokines (MIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF) over the course of an RSV infection may help to decipher the relevancy of these cytokines in viral clearance and lung integrity, and represents important questions to be addressed by future studies.",
