However, such a hypothesis is not strong and should\nbe thoroughly discussed. Recently, researchers have discussed the credibility of the\nhypothesis. For instance, Liu et al. implement the distribution of an\nepidemic is always inhomogeneous after the transition process in Refs. 13 and 14, where they present the characteristic infected cluster\nsize (CICS), which characterizes the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading. However, the\nCICS measurement studied on the typical size of the largest infected cluster, which cannot\nreflect the infected clusters.",

Our results indicate the inhomogeneity decreases even disappears with\nthe increase of r. And one can see that \u03b4*\nmonotonously decreases with the increase of r. The reason for this is that\nthe neighbors can infect each other in interaction neighborhoods which are determined by the\nradius r at each time step. As pairwise interactions increase with\nr, it is possible for a susceptible agent to be infected more by its\ninfected neighbors. So the infected agents are prone to form large infected clusters.",
