            "text": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) belong to the group of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown etiology [1]. IBDs are complex and multifactorial involving genetic, environmental and microbial factors [2], [3]. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by T cells is responsible for both initiation and perpetuation of IBD. Cytokine production in lamina propria CD4+ T lymphocytes differs between CD and UC. Whereas CD is associated with increased production of T helper 1 cell (Th1) type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), UC is associated with T cells that produce large amounts of the Th2 type cytokine IL-5, however, IFN-\u03b3 production is not affected [4], [5], [6]. Th1 and Th2 cells cross-regulate one another in their differentiation.",

Expression levels of IFITM genes have been found to be up-regulated in gastric cancer cell and colorectal tumors [7], [8]. The IFITM family potently inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [9], SARS coronavirus [10], West Nile virus and dengue virus infections [11]. IFITM1 was initially cloned from a human lymphoid cell cDNA library [12], and is located on chromosome 11p15.5 [13]. IFITM1 proteins play separate roles in mouse primordial germ cell homing and repulsion [14], and also play an essential role in the anti-proliferative action of IFN-\u03b3 [15].",

However, other IFITM family including the IFITM1 gene in the epipathogenesis of UC has not been elucidated. In an attempt to understand the genetic influences of IFITM1 on UC, we have identified possible variation sites and SNPs through the two exons of IFITM1 and their boundary intron sequences, including the \u223c2.2 kb promoter regions. To determine whether or not these IFITM1 SNPs are associated with susceptibility to UC, genotype and allele frequencies of IFITM1 polymorphisms were analyzed on genomic DNAs isolated from UC patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated haplotype frequencies constructed by these SNPs in both groups. We also evaluated the expression levels in the putative functional promoter polymorphisms by performing a luciferase reporter assay to determine the change of their activity.",

The LD coefficients (|D\u2032|) between all SNP pairs were calculated, and there was no absolute LD (|D\u2032| = 1 and r\n2\n = 1) among the SNPs of the IFITM1 gene (data not shown). Among the identified polymorphisms, two SNPs (g.-1920G>A and g.-416C>G) were selected for large sample genotyping. The SNP, g.-1275C>T (rs79441268, but not detected in our study), from the NCBI SNP database, was also genotype analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. However, when 192 samples were analyzed, there was only a genotype. These results indicate that the g.-1275C>T (rs79441268) of IFITM1 might be a very rare polymorphism or monomorphism in the Korean population.",

Although the genotype and allelic frequencies of the IFITM1 g.-416C>G in the UC patient group were not significantly different from those of the healthy control group, the genotype and allelic frequencies of the IFITM1 g.-1920G>A between the UC patients group and the healthy controls group were significantly different (Table 2\n, P\n = 0.002 and 0.04, respectively). These results suggest that the g.-1920G>A identified in IFITM1 appear to be associated with UC susceptibility. To determine the possible correlation between the haplotypes associated with g.-1920G>A and g.-416C>G of the IFITM1 gene and UC susceptibility, we further analyzed haplotype frequencies of the SNPs in the UC patients and the healthy controls (Table 3\n). While the major (AC) haplotypes explaining more than 62.1% of the distributions were identified in the healthy controls, the AC haplotypes (57.8%), out of four possible haplotypes, were identified in the UC patients. However there are no significant differences between the groups (P\n = 0.239). These results suggest that the haplotype frequency of IFITM1 polymorphisms might be not associated with UC susceptibility.",

Although great advances have been made in the management of IBD with the introduction of immune-modulators and monoclonal antibodies, the precise etiology of IBD is unclear. However, IBD is thought to be the result of an aberrant intestinal immune response to bacterial microflora and this occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. Multiple IBD susceptibility loci (referred to as IBD 1\u20139) have been implicated in genomic studies in human. The most extensively studied genetic region, associated with IBD, among these loci is the IBD1 locus (16p13.1\u201316q12.2). The NOD2 gene, which has been widely shown to influence both the susceptibility and phenotype of patients with CD, is located at the IBD1 locus [19], [20], [21]. Most studies have shown an association between NOD2 mutations and the susceptibility to CD, but not to UC. We previously reported that an exon 4 variation of the Tim-1 gene and the SNPs of the IL27, TNFRSF17 and EED genes were associated with UC in a Korean population [18], [22], [23], [24].",

The genotype frequency of g.-1920G>A polymorphisms in UC patients was significantly different from that of the healthy control group (Table 2). This result strongly suggests that SNPs of IFITM1 may be associated with susceptibility to UC. These results led us to think it is interesting to know that IFITM1 gene polymorphism (g.-1920G>A) may have some influence on the susceptibility to UC. This may happen because the polymorphisms within the binding site of the promoter region may influence the expression level by suppression or activation of binding between the specific transcriptional binding site and transcription factor. Due to its implication, we decided to investigate the role of the g.-1920G>A polymorphism in the IFITM1 by luciferase reporter assay. Our result shows that the luciferase activity for the A allele with g.-1920G>A polymorphism was higher than that for the G allele in the SW480 cells (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the g.-1920G allele might affect the decreased transcriptional activity level of the IFITM1 gene in vivo, and it might have an influence on the susceptibility to UC.",
