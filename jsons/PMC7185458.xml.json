When assayed, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are frequently detected in ARTIs4 often leading to confusion when the high total number of HRV co-detections is assumed to equate to an equally high proportion of HRVs in co-detections with other \u201crespiratory viruses\u201d. Symptomatic HRV infections are associated with the common cold syndrome and episodic expiratory wheezing early in life.5, 6, 7 Despite this, many relevant studies still do not include them during virus screening. Exposure to HRV strains begins early and continues throughout life. Unsurprisingly, the impact of HRV infections on healthcare expenditure is also significant8, 9 as is their broader role within the hygiene hypothesis. Frequent, mild infections by HRVs may be a major factor in the maturation of a robust innate and acquired antiviral immunity10 perhaps through the apparently unmoderated HRV activation of the antiviral state.11\n",

In a study of infants, HRV strains were co-detected in only 65% of instances compared to 80% of HRSV detections.30 Among children, more than one third of HPIV, HMPV, HCoV-NL63 and HAdV positives were involved in co-detections whereas only 17% of picornaviruses were detected with another virus.31 Our observations are consistent with the findings of Brunstein et al. who identified significant associations between some viruses in the respiratory tract.3 However that study observed an unusually low frequency of HRV detection compared to ours, possibly due to the oligonucleotides they employed or their use of a multiplex PCR method which may have been adversely affected by the competitive amplification of multiple templates. Additionally, the study only collected specimens across a 4 month period compared to the 12 month period of our observations.",

HRVs are considered to mediate illness through immunological rather than cytopathic mechanisms. HRV replication, as for HRSV and IFV, produces double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replicative intermediates33; molecules which mediate triggering of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes inducing an antiviral state.11, 34, 35 It is possible that one mechanism behind the putative interference patterns we observed, strongest for HRVs but also in action among other viruses, may have been related to this innate IFN response which shields neighbouring cells from viral infection. Interestingly HCoV, IFAV, HEV and HPIV are also RNA viruses, but they had only 2, 2, 0 and 3 negative associations, respectively, compared to 3 for HBoV, a DNA virus (Table 1, Table 2), indicating that negative associations were not determined by nucleic acid type alone. Based on the literature available, there are no clearly defined mechanisms whereby HRVs antagonise the IFN cascade, indirectly apparent from the large body of literature describing their efficient induction of IFN and associated cytokines36, 37, 38, 39, 40; unusual among viruses and a possible reason for the scale of the statistical patterns we observed. Additionally, the IFN-antagonizing mechanisms employed by other viruses41, 42 may inadvertently permit higher frequencies of co-infection via attenuation of the innate response. A weak or absent IFN-antagonistic mechanism should generally result in the rapid suppression of HRV replication. This is not the case for asthmatic individuals because of diminished innate43, 43 and acquired44 antiviral defences resulting in more infections45 with higher HRV viral loads36 for longer periods associated with more severe symptoms.43, 46\n",

We did not seek the contribution of bacteria since it is difficult to distinguish a pathogenic versus colonizing role in the upper airways. Also, our study sample was drawn from individuals ill enough to require medical care and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. This sample is not representative of the general population although it is drawn from it. The contribution of as yet unidentified respiratory viruses could not be gauged and furthermore, as with any PCR-based method, it was impossible to state that every possible strain of each target virus was detected. Nonetheless, in our hands the HRV assay22 successfully detected many strains from HRV A, B and the proposed C species.18, 47 Our observations require confirmation in other data sets, particularly across multiple years to account for the contribution of those viruses which were not epidemic in Queensland during 2003.",

In light of this, we have formulated a new hypothesis, that HRV infection can protect its host from infection by other, often more cytopathic, viruses. We could not address the order of infection by the viruses detected here but future epidemiological studies should prospectively enrol and sample subjects regardless of symptomatic context, for at least 12 months, screening for all known respiratory viruses using PCR. If our new hypothesis is correct, serial sampling and testing will find that immediately after an HRV infection in the immunocompetent host, there is a period of time during which subjects are refractory to the acquisition of another respiratory virus. Such investigations should continue to find that proportionately, co-detections involving other virus pairings are relatively more prevalent.",

Our data are also interesting in the context of recent claims that HRVs may contribute to the spread of pandemic influenza through the mechanism of increased coughing and sneezing with subsequent increased aerosol spread of influenza virus.50 We suggest that acquisition of an HRV infection may paradoxically provide a natural protection against influenza infection.",
