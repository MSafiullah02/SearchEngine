It was not until the early 1980s that the name \u201cLemierre\u2019s syndrome\u201d was introduced by Shannon et al. in a case of oropharyngeal septicaemia, ironically caused by Bacteroides melaninogenicus and not by F. necrophorum [2]. Typical Lemierre\u2019s syndrome begins with pharyngotonsillitis, followed by unilateral swelling and tenderness along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, owing to septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein [1, 3\u20139]. Postanginal F. necrophorum septicaemia with high fever and metastatic lung abscesses often develops within a week [1, 3, 5\u20138, 10\u201312]. Lemierre claimed that the syndrome is so characteristic, that the clinical diagnosis is nearly impossible to mistake [1]. He also wrote that anaerobic septicaemia arising from otitis media and buccal suppuration following from infected teeth had clinical manifestations very similar to postanginal septicaemias, and that these infections were remarkably similar, irrespective of the primary focus [1].",

Some authors only include disseminated F. necrophorum infections originating from the throat, while we and others include all disseminated cases with primary foci in the head and neck, as they have much in common, even though they may originate from different head foci and have different age distributions [1, 3\u20138, 11, 13]. We require a septic case of documented F. necrophorum infection by, e.g. the growth of F. necrophorum in blood cultures, dissemination to nearby regions, e.g. mastoiditis in otitis media, and/or dissemination to remote regions, e.g. metastatic pulmonary infections. We choose to name them all as variants of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, appreciating that the oropharyngeal variant of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome is the most common. We believe that this definition gives clinicians, who rarely come into contact with Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, the must useful description of the clinical spectrum of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome. Basically, the clinicians must be reminded that Lemierre\u2019s syndrome is a life-threatening but curable F. necrophorum infection originating in the head, attacking healthy children and youngsters.",

The non-metastatic group was significantly older than the metastatic group, with median age 32 years, range 15\u201366 years, versus 19 years, range 6\u201341 years (p < 0.01). The non-metastatic patients were hospitalised for a significantly shorter period, median 6 versus 26 days (p < 0.001), needed less antibiotic therapy, median 14 versus 31 days (p < 0.001), and had less fever, median 2 versus 13 days (p < 0.01).

The majority of our patients were healthy adolescents with acute non-GAS tonsillitis as the primary infectious focus, as found in other studies, including our former retrospective study [1, 5\u20137, 16, 18]. They were septic with fever and had painful unilateral swelling of the neck, probably due to septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Thrombophlebitis can be diagnosed by ultrasound or, better, by computerised tomography (CT) scanning of the neck, but this was rarely performed in our patients and, therefore, was not of any help as a diagnostic tool in our study [7, 33\u201344]. There are casuistic reports of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome developing from a peritonsillar abscess [45, 46]. However, this current study seems to indicate that peritonsillar abscesses do not normally develop into Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, except under extraordinary circumstances, e.g. accidental direct aspiration to the lungs from the abscess, which is a completely different pathogenic process compared to septic thrombophlebitis propagating from the tonsillar veins, resulting in septic infarcts in the lungs [47\u201349].",

It is probably of more interest that we found that GCS was the predominant concomitant bacterium in the polymicrobial blood cultures of the oropharyngeal cases of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome and it was mainly found in manifest metastatic cases. This may indicate that concomitant GCS infection is a risk factor in itself. Both the role of EBV and GCS in F. necrophorum infections needs further investigation [22].",

Thus, the non-metastatic group may present early stages of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, where the metastatic abscesses are small and/or remain undiagnosed [57]. Manifestly, our non-metastatic patients had less prehospital delay and none developed sequelae, as opposed to the metastatic patients, which we think emphasises the importance of early diagnosis and therapy [7, 8, 57, 58]. Based on the findings in this study, we believe that non-metastatic patients represent early stages of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, but the possibility of \u201ca pure bacteraemic manifestation of F. necrophorum infections\u201d without the development of metastatic abscesses has been suggested, e.g. explained by host factors [4, 59, 60].",

Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and liver abscesses have become infrequent in the antibiotic era, which is in accordance with our findings [67\u201369]. Similar to other studies, we found that disseminated intravascular coagulation and septic shock were rare, but some patients had subclinical hyperbilirubinaemia [5, 7]. The mechanism behind the hyperbilirubinaemia is not known, but it may be a direct effect of the haemolytic activity of F. necrophorum [14, 70].",

Parapharyngeal abscesses are said to originate from the tonsils in 60% of patients, an infected wisdom tooth in 30% and of unknown origin in the last 10% [73\u201376]. The percentage of dental infections have declined over the last few decades, along with improved dental care and oral hygiene [77, 78].

This study shows that these patients rarely developed pulmonary infection and that the infection, per se, was relatively easy to control, contrary to the cases with Lemierre\u2019s syndrome. Age and predisposing diseases contribute to the high mortality in these patients [7, 8].",
