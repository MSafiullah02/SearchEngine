Protection of mice from lethal intranasal VACV challenge required intranasal immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R in a prime-boost protocol, and correlated with low VACV-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-VACV neutralizing antibody. Mice immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R showed some disease symptoms following VACV challenge such as loss of weight and hunching, but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice. While immunization with PIV5 expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization included the PIV5 vector expressing L1R alone or in combination with PIV5-B5R. PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors elicited protection from VACV challenge even when CD8+ cells were depleted, but not in the case of mice that were defective in B cell production. Mice were protected from VACV challenge out to at least 1.5 years after immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors, and showed significant levels of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential for PIV5-based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as VACV, but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly immunogenic viral proteins.",

The outcomes of these viral infections can be significantly influenced by immune responses at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, including the recruitment of innate immune cells, and the activation of T cells and antibody responses (Murphy, 1994; Virgin, 2007; Woodland and Randall, 2004) . As such, there is intense interest in developing vaccination strategies and viral vectors that promote strong and long lasting protective immune responses against viral respiratory tract pathogens. This is particularly important for viral infections in different anatomical regions of the respiratory tract, since the mechanisms controlling immunity in these airway compartments can differ significantly (Woodland and Randall, 2004) . The overall goal of the work described here was to determine the capacity of viral vectors based on parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) to elicit protection against lethal respiratory tract infection by vaccinia virus (VACV).",

While a live attenuated form of VACV is currently used in the United States as a licensed smallpox vaccine, a number of concerns have been raised due to risk of adverse effects of this vaccine (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2009 ). VACV also presents major challenges to the development of alternative vaccination approaches that are based on purified VACV proteins and heterologous vectors expressing VACV antigens (Moss, 2006) . First, VACV exists in two major infectious forms: the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) and the intracellular mature virion (IMV). Importantly, the VACV antigens that are critical for neutralization of these two forms differ (Fogg et al., 2004; Hooper et al., 2000) . For example, L1R is a myristoylated transmembrane protein in the IMV form and is an important target for IMV neutralization (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005b; Franke et al., 1990; Wolffe et al., 1995) . B5R is a membraneanchored VACV protein with an extracellular domain containing regions that are related to some complement regulatory proteins (Engelstad et al., 1992) . Antibodies against B5R are important for neutralization of the EEV form (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005a; Bell et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999) . Because antibodies that neutralize the IMV do not neutralize the Virology 419 (2011) 97-106 EEV, it is thought that immunization with antigens from both of these forms is necessary for maximum protection (Lustig et al., 2005) .",

Finally, the VACV antigens that are important for control of infections initiated through the respiratory tract versus systemic routes (intravenous or intraperitoneal) can differ, and the immune mechanisms for protection from these different routes of infection are not completely understood (Belyakov et al., 2005; Kaufman et al., 2008) .",

Likewise, PIV5 vectors expressing model antigens can elicit strong and long lasting T cell responses which can display a high avidity phenotype (Gray et al., 2003; Parks and Alexander-Miller, 2002) . Importantly, vaccination of both ferrets and mice with recombinant PIV5 vectors did not result in overt pathology and there was no evidence of disease symptoms . These desirable properties raise the potential use of PIV5 vectors as vaccines against complex human pathogens which infect the respiratory tract.",

As shown in Fig. 5A , PBS-treated control mice succumbed to lethal infection by days 8-10 (closed triangles), whereas all of the CD8depleted mice that had been immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors were completely protected (open circles). Some CD8-depleted control mice that had received a single sublethal dose of VACV also succumbed to VACV challenge (closed squares), a finding that is consistent with previous reports for a role of cellular immunity in the case of some VACV infections (Belyakov et al., 2005; Wyatt et al., 2004) . Although PIV5 immunized mice were protected from lethality they still showed disease symptoms such as hunching and loss of weight (data not shown). For PIV5-immunized mice, the magnitude of weight loss (~20-25%) and kinetics of weight loss (maximal at day 8 post challenge) were very similar to that seen without CD8 depletion (data not shown). Thus, protection from VACV lethality induced by PIV5-L1R/B5R does not depend on CD8+ cells.",

By contrast, sera from control mice immunized with PBS showed no significant reduction in plaques (Fig. 6E) .

Mice were then housed for 1.5 years before challenging I.N. with 20 MTD 50 of VACV. As shown in Fig. 8A , mice that had been immunized with sublethal doses of VACV or with the PIV5 vectors were protected from lethal challenge. One of these aged PIV5immunized mice died during this experiment due to necrosis resulting from tail bleeding (star Fig. 8A ), but this was not due to lack of protection from I.N. challenge. As with newly immunized and challenged animals, these mice that had been previously immunized with PIV5-L1R and PIV5-B5R and challenged at later points showed a loss of weight 8 day post challenge, but then rapidly regained weight to nearly 90% of initial values (Fig. 8B) . Serum from mice that had been immunized with the PIV5 vectors contained statistically significant levels of neutralizing antibodies out to 1.5 years after immunization. This is evident in Fig. 8C where a 1:25 dilution of serum from mice immunized with the PIV5-L1R and -B5R vectors reduced IMV VACV infectivity by~70% compared to the~90% seen with control sera from control mice that had received sublethal VACV infection (Fig. 8D) .

The I.N. infection route was chosen here based on the need for new vaccines to protect against aerosolized VACV which may have different requirements for protection from challenge by other routes (Kaufman et al., 2008) and the assumption that parainfluenza viruses would elicit the most robust responses by infection through the respiratory route. Our results indicate that PIV5 vectors expressing the VACV L1R and B5R proteins confer long lasting protective immunity against lethal I.N. VACV challenge. Protection from VACV-mediated lethality required a prime plus boost immunization protocol administered by the I.N. route, depended on B cells but not CD8 + cells and was capable of protecting mice for longer than 1.5 years after immunization. While immunization with vectors expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization involved PIV5 expressing L1R alone or in combination with B5R. Taken together these results support the further development of PIV5-based vectors for immunization against highly pathogenic and complex human viruses such as poxviruses.",

            "text": "Mice responded to our PIV5 vectors by generating high ELISA titers of antibodies to the PIV5 vector and but relatively low ELISA titers of antibodies to VACV L1R and B5R proteins. We have previously shown that WT PIV5 elicits a very strong anti-PIV5 antibody response detected in serum include very high anti-PIV5 IgG and IgA responses in BAL (Fig. 6) . By contrast, results from ELISA data showed that the serum antibody responses to L1R and B5R were at low levels and were not detectable in BAL (Fig. 6) . This is consistent with previous work showing that the L1R and B5R proteins are poorly immunogenic when expressed outside of the context of the native VACV. This is also reflected in the need for multiple vaccinations with pure L1R and B5R proteins to generate high antibody titers that provide protection (Berhanu et al., 2008; Braxton et al., 2010; Delaney et al., 2010; Fogg et al., 2004; Hooper et al., 2000; Xiao et al., 2007) . It is known that there is an initial innate response in mouse lung to PIV5 infection. However, as we have shown that PIV5 is cleared from the respiratory tract by 9 days after infection , it is unlikely that an innate response to the vector contributes substantially to protection from lethal VACV infection. This is further supported by the key findings that protection requires B cells and that mice are protected up to 1\u00bd years after immunization with the PIV5 vectors. Importantly however, the PIV5 vectors elicited protection in mice that was dependent on B cells and generated functional anti-VACV antibody titers were easily detected during in vitro neutralization assays (Figs. 5 and 6) . These data suggest that PIV5 vectors elicit memory B cells that respond to secondary exposure during VACV challenge by increasing levels of neutralizing anti-VACV antibodies. Alternatively, protection from VACV challenge could involve antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-mediated cell lysis, both of which are dependent on antibodies to VACV proteins. The role of complement in VACV protection has been shown previously (Benhnia et al., 2009) , and is currently being tested in the context of PIV5-based vectors.",

VACV infection required a prime and a boost immunization administered by the I.N. route. This may reflect a higher level or prolonged expression of antigens in the airways of mice infected with VSV vectors compared to PIV5 vectors. In view of the finding that the anti-PIV5 antibody response to primary I.N. infection of mice is very strong (titer of~10 4 , , it is somewhat surprising that a boost with the same PIV5 vectors promoted protection from VACV challenge. This is particularly true of anti-PIV5 titers in the BAL, which were very high for IgA. Work is in progress to define the mechanism by which boosting with the PIV5 vectors influences protection from VACV challenge even in the face of a strong response due to prior exposure to PIV5.",

This was most notable in PIV5immunized mice by the loss of weight starting at days 3-4, but this was also evident by signs of illness such as hunching, ruffled fur, conjunctivitis, labored breathing, lethargy and unresponsiveness to stimulus (not shown). Importantly, the kinetics of appearance of illness in PIV5-immunized mice was delayed and less severe compared to control PBS-treated animals, and the PIV5-immunized animals showed an improvement to near normal properties by day 12 post challenge. Similar results have been shown for animals vaccinated with purified VACV proteins (Delaney et al., 2010; Fogg et al., 2004) and with VSVbased vectors expressing L1R and B5R (Braxton et al., 2010) , where immunized animals lost weight following VACV challenge even though they were protected from lethality. The disease symptoms in PIV5immunized animals could reflect a delay in response of memory B cells in PIV5 immunized animals to VACV antigens during the challenge. Additional possibilities include a lower immune response to PIV5-based vaccination due to the fact that PIV5 immunized animals are exposed to only two of the multiple antigenic proteins that expressed during a VACV infection (Berhanu et al., 2008; Fogg et al., 2004; Hooper et al., 2000) , or to alternative conformations of B5R and L1R when expressed from PIV5 versus bone fide VACV infection. In the latter case, we engineered expression of soluble versions of L1R and B5R to enhance release from infected cells and possible uptake of secreted antigen. However, as the immunogenicity of L1R is particularly sensitive to conformational changes (Su et al., 2007) , PIV5-expressed L1R may not elicit strong antibody responses due to its expression as an HA-tagged cytoplasmic protein.",

These desirable PIV5 properties including infections are largely noncytopathic in most cell types, and that PIV5 is not associated with any disease in humans (Goswami et al., 1984) . In ferrets and mice, PIV5 stimulates strong antibody and T cell responses, is cleared from respiratory tissues by 7-9 days pi without evidence of systemic infection and induces no overt pathology. As discussed previously , the ferret model may be a more appropriate system for analysis of features of the PIV5 vectors, since the mouse is not a good predictor of viral permissiveness/ tropism in humans. PIV5 can elicit strong systemic mucosal IgG and IgA responses, even when delivered by different routes. PIV5 is grown to very high titers (N10 10 PFU/ml) in Vero cells, an approved cell line for vaccine work. Finally, anti-PIV5 sero-prevalence can be relatively low in many human populations (Hsiung, 1972; Johnson et al., 2008) . A PIV5 vector was shown to elicit protective immunity in mice against influenza virus (Tompkins et al., 2007) , although the mechanism of protection in that study was not addressed.",

Female BALB/c mice (5-8 weeks of age) were purchased from Charles River. Jh B cell-deficient mice were of BALB/c origin. Mice were anesthetized with avertin and immunized intranasally (I.N.) as previously described Gray et al., 2003) with 10 6 PFU of purified PIV5 vector in 20 \u03bcl of PBS. Control animals were given a sublethal dose of 0.1 Median Tolerated Dose (MTD 50 ) of VACV (100 PFU) by I.N. administration in 10 \u03bcl of PBS. As the Wake Forest University ACUC does not allow death as an endpoint, we used MTD 50 to denote a dose where 50% of the animals show signs of illness (e.g. loss of weight to 70% of initial) that are significant enough to warrant euthanasia. Thus, 50% of the animals tolerate this dose of virus. In prime-boost protocols, mice were given a second immunization with 10 6 PFU of virus at the indicated days post primary immunization.",

Antibody was dialyzed in PBS and concentration was determined by BCA. To deplete CD8+ cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally for 4 consecutive days with 0.5 mg of anti-CD8 antibody in a total volume of 0.5 ml PBS. As a control, some mice received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS.
