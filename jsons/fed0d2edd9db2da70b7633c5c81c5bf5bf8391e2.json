Engagement of specific glycan receptors such as sialylated carbohydrates, glycosaminoglycans, or histoblood group antigens can determine host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity. Glycan receptorbinding sites are typically located in exposed regions on viral surfaces-sites that are also generally prone to binding of neutralizing antibodies that directly interfere with virus-glycan receptor interactions. In this review, we examine the locations and architecture of the glycan-and antibody-binding sites in four different viruses with stalk-like attachment proteins (reovirus, influenza virus, norovirus, and coronavirus) and investigate the mechanisms by which antibodies block glycan recognition. Those viruses exemplify that direct molecular mimicking of glycan receptors by antibodies is rare and further demonstrate that antibodies often partly overlap or bind sufficiently close to the receptor-binding region to hinder access to this site, achieving neutralization partially because of the epitope location and partly due to their sheer size.",

For some viruses, a single receptor is sufficient to promote infection, while others require additional attachment factors or coreceptors for cell entry. Cell-surface carbohydrates linked to proteins or lipids are often-used receptors, and they are recognized by numerous viruses to facilitate attachment and entry. The carbohydrates that are typically hijacked by viruses can be grouped into three classes: sialylated carbohydrates, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). The glycosylation of a protein can also help mediating receptor recognition.",

            "text": "Sialylated carbohydrates are ubiquitously expressed among vertebrates and engaged by numerous viruses including influenza viruses, orthoreoviruses, human coronaviruses (CoVs) and adenoviruses. These glycans contain sialic acids, which are usually found at the termini of the branches of N-glycans, Oglycans, and glycosphingolipids, and they display a high level of diversity. This diversity arises from possible sialic acid modifications such as acetylation, methylation, hydroxylation, and sulfation in addition to different glycosidici linkage types that connect sialic acids to subsequent carbohydrate residues in the chain. Although a2,3 and a2,6 glycosidic linkages to galactose (Gal) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) are the most common types found in these sialoglycan structures. To some degree, virus host range specificity can be determined by the glycosidic linkage type, as seen for example in influenza viruses. [1] [2] [3] GAGs represent another class of virus glycan receptors or attachment factors and are recognized by, for example, herpesviruses and papillomaviruses. These linear polysaccharides are built from repeating units of b1,4-linked disaccharides, which contain an N-acetylated or N-sulfated amino sugar and an uronic acid or Gal unit. 4 Prominent examples for GAGs are chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. Typically, several GAG chains are covalently attached via serine residues to a core protein, and together they form proteoglycans, which are produced by virtually all mammalian cells. 4 An important characteristic of GAGs is their overall negative charge, conferred by non-stoichiometric sulfation and the uronic acid carboxy groups.",

Each step of the synthesis is catalyzed by a specific glycosyltransferase. FUT1 and FUT2 gene products control the same reaction. FUT1 is expressed in erythrocytes and FUT2 in secretory tissues giving rise to its glycosidic product in saliva and mucosal secretions.

Whereas all three glycan types can be used as receptors for viruses, structural data are available primarily for virus-sialyloligosaccharide and virus-HBGA interactions. We have therefore focused on representatives for these two interactions, as well as another example, where an N-glycosylated protein serves as receptor.

Glycan array screening identified the oligosaccharide portion of ganglioside GM2 as a receptor for T1L. 11 Structural analyses of the interaction of the GM2 glycan and T1L r1 revealed that the glycan-binding site lies in a small groove in the r1 head domain [ Fig. 3(A) ].

Several regions of the r1 protein are immunogenic and different T3 r1-specific antibodies have been used to identify distinct functional domains of the protein. 21 In vivo, protection from reovirus-induced disease occurs in neonatal mice with neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies. 20, 22 The non-neutralizing antibodies that target r3 were able to inhibit reovirus replication at a post-binding step, inhibiting either internalization or uncoating. The r1-specific neutralizing antibodies act by blocking virus cell attachment and bind r1 with high affinity. 23 The neutralizing epitopes of T1-and T3-r1 specific antibodies have been mapped to the r1 head domain by viral escape mutant analysis. 24, 25 Crystal structures of r1 complexed with Fab fragments of these antibodies revealed in both cases a quaternary epitope that spans two r1 subunits 26 (Fig. 3) .

The heavy chain contributes about three times more to the epitope than the light chain, with its long CDR H3 loop forming most interactions.

Several aromatic amino acids (mostly tyrosine residues) of the 5C6 complementarity determining regions (CDR) form hydrogen bonds and/or contribute to the binding via hydrophobic interactions with r1.

            "text": "Influenza viruses are responsible for respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, posing a significant challenge to human health and resulting in a substantial economic burden. 27 Influenza viruses, which belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped ss(-)RNA viruses. They are classified into three different subtypes, A-C, according to their serological cross-reactivity. The so called \"flu\" in humans is generally caused by Type A and B influenza viruses, with Type A being responsible for the more severe disease in humans. 28 Further classification is based on two glycoproteins projecting from the viral envelope, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with H1N1 being the most prominent example in humans. 29, 30 HA is the major surface glycoprotein and mediates cell attachment as well as fusion between the virus and host membranes. 30 The HA prefusion homotrimer undergoes a maturation process in the presence of host proteases, resulting in disulfide-linked HA1 and HA2 subunits. The HA generally consists of a head (HA1) and a stem (HA2) domain, where the head domain includes the receptor-binding pocket that interacts with sialic acid receptors on the host cell to mediate entry. 31 The head domain is therefore an important target of neutralizing antibodies. 32 It has been shown that human influenza A viruses bind preferentially to sialylated glycans with an a2,6 linkage between the terminal sialic acid and Gal. Avian viruses, on the other hand, have a preference for binding glycans with an a2,3 linkage at this position. The HA head is subject to constant antigenic drift, enabling the virus to evade the host immune response. Residues that make up the receptor-binding site (RBS) are more restricted in their mutational freedom because they are crucial for receptor recognition and binding. The analysis of sequences of pandemic virus strains allows to identify mutations in the RBS of HA that might be important for switching virus specificity. However, the Spanish Flu (H1N1) pandemic in 1918 was likely caused by only a pair of mutations in the RBS of an avian influenza virus, leading to a receptor switch from a2,3 to a2,6 linked glycans and therefore conferring human-to-human transmissibility. [33] [34] [35] Whereas a2,6 linked glycans are mainly found on human epithelial cells in the trachea and parts of the upper respiratory tract, avian viruses typically bind to a2,3 linked glycans, which can be found in the intestine of birds. Mutating only one of those sites in the H1N1 RBS already confers a dual binding to both a2,3 and a2,6 linked glycans. 34, 36, 37 Over the last years, the number of available broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against human influenza viruses has increased substantially. These bnAbs show different levels of crossreactivity against divergent strains within and across subtypes. High resolution X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy aided in the discovery of so-called supersites of vulnerability on the HA that are recognized by bnAbs. Studies of bnAb-HA complexes revealed different modes of recognition according to which antibodies can be classified into two different groups: HA head-reactive antibodies and the more recently discovered HA stemreactive antibodies. A subgroup of HA head-reactive antibodies are RBS-targeted antibodies, which further can be divided into antibodies either recognizing a single subtype or heterosubtypes, or antibodies employing receptor mimicry (see review 30 ).",

Antibody 5J8 also employs receptor mimicry similar to that of CH65 and CH67, but additionally shows neutralization activity against a broader range of H1 strains, including the 1918 and 2009 pandemic strains. The HA RBS is contacted by a heavy chain CDR3 of 5J8 that is responsible for this binding mode: the side chain of residue Asp H100b adopts an orientation similar to the one observed for the sialic acid carboxylate and additionally forms hydrogen bonds to conserved receptor-binding residues, which could also be observed for other broadly neutralizing H1 antibodies. The interaction of HA with host-cell sialyloglycans is therefore directly sterically blocked by the heavy chain CDR3 (Fig. 4) . 39, 40 Nevertheless, there are features of the sialoglycan receptor that are not mimicked by antibody 5J8. The receptor mimicry is spatially constrained, since the RBS allows only the interaction with one antibody loop with the binding pocket. Only half of the buried surface area of the 5J8-HA complex involves the RBS. Regions adjacent to the RBS are contacted by CDR of both heavy and light chain and the total buried surface area on each HA subunit adds up to about 660 \u00c5 2 , involving several electrostatic and many van der Waals interactions stabilizing the interface.",

            "text": "Noroviruses (NoVs), members of the genus Caliciviridae, are a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis and form an antigenically diverse group of small nonenveloped ss(1)RNA viruses. These enteric pathogens are usually associated with short-term disease, but can be life-threatening to elderly and immunocompromised individuals. 41 Susceptibility to most human NoVs is linked to the genetically determined expression of HBGAs, namely the ABH and Lewis family that serve as cell attachment factors for these viruses. 42 Interaction studies of virus-like particles with HBGAs revealed a diverse-binding pattern among different NoV strains. The relationship between NoV infection and histo-blood group-associated phenotypes was also shown in human volunteer studies. [43] [44] [45] [46] Lack of specific glycosyltransferases that are involved in HBGA synthesis due to silent alleles leads to a polymorphic biosynthesis of these antigens among the human population. Presence of a functional fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene results in \"secretor-positive\" phenotypes, while absence leads to a \"non-secretor\" phenotype lacking ABH and Le b antigens in saliva and mucosal secretions. 47 NoVs engage HBGAs through the surface-exposed P2 subdomain of their major capsid protein VP1. 48 The structural basis of this interaction has been studied in detail by X-ray crystallography, revealing locally distinct HBGA-binding sites between the two genogroups GI and GII, which also differ structurally. These two genogroups include most human NoVs. [49] [50] [51] Genotype GI.1, also referred to as Norwalk virus, was first described and is the prototype strain of (GI) NoVs, while genotype GII.4 variants are most prevalent and account for most human NoV infections.",

            "text": "CoVs belong to the family of Coronaviridae and are enveloped, ss(1)RNA viruses that can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious diseases in animals and humans. They are classified into the four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-CoV. 61, 62 CoVs possess a trimeric envelope spike glycoprotein (S), which is responsible for receptor binding, membrane fusion, and viral entry. 63 The S protein is organized into a membrane-distal N-terminal S1 domain, a membrane-proximal S2 domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain. 64 The receptorbinding domain (RBD) is part of the S1 domain, which determines cellular tropism, while the S2 domain mediates virus-cell fusion. 65 CoVs differ substantially in their RBD with regard to sequence and structure, and they consequently recognize different entry receptors. The viruses show a complex receptor recognition pattern where even highly similar CoVs from the same genus recognize different receptors. 66 A novel CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) was first identified in June 2012. 67 MERS-CoV infection causes symptoms such as severe pneumonia, septic shock, and multi-organ failure, which in many cases is fatal (http://www. who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). So far, there is no specific treatment or vaccine against CoVs available but due to the epidemic and pandemic potential of emerging CoVs such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, there is an urgent need of medical countermeasures. 68 MERS-CoV utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, as cellular receptor. DPP4 exhibits neither structural nor any significant sequence similarities to previously identified CoV receptors, such as the carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule 1, a receptor for mouse hepatitis virus, or aminopeptidase N, a receptor for several CoVs. 69, 70 However, the importance of N-linked glycosylation for receptor recognition and specificity is common to these receptors. A number of CoVs from different genera (infecting mice, pigs, or birds) use sialic acids as attachment factors. 71, 72 DPP4 is a multifunctional, Type-II-membrane glycoprotein and is highly conserved among mammals, where it plays important roles in T-cell activation, glucose metabolism and apoptosis. 73, 74 The structure of DPP4 contains an N-terminal b-propeller domain 75 consisting of eight blades, and structural analyses of complexes with the S protein show that DPP4 contacts the RBD of MERS-CoV with Blades 4 and 5. 76, 77 The binding interface reveals a series of residues that are critical for the virusreceptor engagement. 78 Interactions involve some hydrophilic residues, which form a polar network, as well as three hydrophobic residues. 65, 77 As for all CoVs, N-linked glycosylation of the receptor is important for binding to MERS-CoV. In the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV RBD-DPP4 complex (PDB code 4KR0), a trisaccharide attached to N229 contacting the RBD is well defined. 76, 77 The first Nacetylglucosamine (NAG) residue of the glycan moiety forms a hydrogen bond with RBD Glu536, while the second NAG stacks onto the aromatic ring of Trp535. The third mannose residue contacts Trp535 via hydrogen bonding. 65, 76, 77 These interactions are crucial for binding to DPP4 and the viral entry of MERS-CoV. 79 Since MERS-CoV uses DPP4 as single cellular receptor for viral entry, agents capable of blocking this interaction would be promising candidates for blocking the entry of the virus into the target cell. 80 It was shown that monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibit MERS-CoV infection in different cell types. 74, 81 As DPP4 plays important roles in multiple cellular processes, antibodies against DPP4 may however cause unwanted side reactions. Hence, antibodies targeting the RBD of MERS-CoV are preferred. 80 Additionally, it was shown in animal models that the entry of MERS-CoV could be inhibited by polyclonal antibodies against MERS-CoV RBD. [82] [83] [84] These studies fortify the hypothesis that antibodies directed against the RBD might efficiently block MERS-CoV entry. Recently, two neutralizing antibodies were identified 79 in a library screening approach against the RBD of MERS-CoV. These antibodies were also shown to inhibit in vitro infection of live MERS-CoV and pseudoviruses, making them potential candidates for combating MERS-CoV infection. 79, 80 So far, only the crystal structure for the complex of MERS-CoV bound to MERS-27 is available (PDB code 4ZS6). 79 In this complex, both the heavy and the light chain of MERS-27 interact with MERS-CoV RBD. The binding epitope of MERS-27 shows only a small overlap with the binding epitope of DPP4, yet the insertion of Trp535 and its carbohydrate moiety into the cavity between heavy and light chain completely disrupts protein-protein and proteincarbohydrate interactions between RBD and its receptor DPP4 (Fig. 6) . 79 Hence, MERS-27 would prevent the engagement of DPP4 in part by clashing with the N-glycan attached to the receptor.",

Identifying and characterizing viral receptors and defining mechanisms of virus attachment and internalization improves our understanding of infection processes and viral replication cycles, and this mechanistic knowledge can ultimately inform strategies for antiviral therapy-for example, through targeted interference with attachment or release. Neutralizing antibodies play a central role for natural protection from viral infections. The characterization of antibodies from patients who survived life-threatening diseases, for example, ebola virus disease, demonstrates the vast therapeutic potential of antibodies 85, 86 ; however, our understanding of antibodymediated neutralization has not yet reached a level that allows us to fully exploit this potential in antibody-based therapies or vaccination. The structural analysis of bnAbs and their binding epitopes on viral surfaces can help to further advance this understanding and, ultimately, the development of individual antiviral strategies.",

The RBSs of these spikes are most distal to the virus particle, and, therefore, are often part of or in direct proximity to the epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies. It seems intuitive that both RBSs and epitopes for antibody recognition benefit from facile accessibility of the respective region on virus particle, and also that those antibodies that prevent simultaneous receptor binding via steric hindrance are particularly efficient immunological tools. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the receptor and antibodybinding sites of the four viruses discussed in this article overlap in many cases. A comparison shows that while most often no direct glycan receptor mimicry is employed by the antibodies, partial (reovirus) or complete (CoV) blocking of the glycan-binding site is a common feature in virus-antibody complexes.",

            "text": "Efficient neutralization can also be observed for antibodies that bind in the immediate vicinity but do not show any overlap with the glycan-binding site (norovirus). In these cases, all antibodies possess conformational epitopes, a common characteristic for neutralizing antibodies. A special case is quaternary epitopes that span multiple subunits, as is seen, for example, for the reovirus-targeting 5C6 antibody. Here, the antibody-binding site bridges two subunits in juxtaposition with residues responsible for glycan engagement found in a single monomer. There is no obvious requirement of such a subunit \"bridging\" for the ability of the antibody to block glycan binding, but the bridging might well prevent conformational changes of the viral attachment protein during later entry steps. This is well established for some enveloped viruses, for which antibodies have been found to stabilize a pre-fusion state of the virus, thereby preventing conformational changes that are required for receptor binding or membrane fusion. Examples are the neutralizing antibody 37.7H targeting lassa virus, or the monoclonal antibody 2D22 against dengue virus. 87, 88 From a biochemical point of view, there are profound differences between glycan and antibodies with respect to virus-engagement, first because of the relative size but also because of the physiological context in which these interactions occur. Viruses bind to individual glycan receptors with relatively low affinity (often in the mM K d -range) using only a limited number of contacts. Because the local density of some glycoconjugates, for example gangliosides, on the plasma membrane can be very high, the low individual binding energy is typically enhanced by engaging multiple receptor copies at the same time, that is, low affinity is overcome by high avidity. Antibodies, on the other hand, need to have a high affinity (at least nM K d -range) for virion surface antigens to mediate efficient neutralization. In part (and particular when compared with glycan binding) this is due to the limited number of the comparably large antibodies that can simultaneously engage a viral spike protein without clashing. Thus, while the location of glycan RBSs and antibody epitopes on viral capsids may often overlap at least in part, other aspects of glycan-and antibody-virus interactions are fundamentally different (Fig. 7) .",

Generally, a large fraction of the CDRs is comprised of aromatic residues such as tryptophane and tyrosine, whose antigen interactions can therefore be based on their hydrophobic, aromatic, and hydrophilic character. Glycans also rely on different types of noncovalent interactions to facilitate protein binding. Dependent on the orientation of the functional groups, the faces of glycan rings exhibit a different pattern between hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. 89 They can participate in hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, as well as in hydrophobic and CHp interactions. Glycan receptor mimicry by antibodies is probably limited due to geometrical and spatial restraints of the CDRs. One rare example for glycan receptor mimicry is antibody 5J8, which targets the RBS on HA of human influenza A virus.",

[90] [91] [92] Here, antibodies that mimic CD4-binding can elicit this change, thereby rendering gp120 vulnerable to the immune system.

Due to crystal contacts that prevent ligand binding, one H-type HBGA is modeled based on a superposition with the other subunit. (B) Side view of the P domain. Fabs 5I2 with light and heavy chain (colored in light and dark violet, respectively) binding their antigen-this engagement would partiallly mask and sterically block glycan binding. (C) The close up view shows a direct clash of glycan moieties and the heavy chain of 5I2.",

Detailed view of the MERS-CoV RBD with focus on residue Trp535. (C) DPP4 receptor binding on RBD (shown in green and gray cartoon representation, respectively) with the Asn229-linked carbohydrate moiety in DPP4 (shown in yellow stick representation) interacting with residue Trp535. (D) Complex of RBD with MERS-27 Fab. The heavy and light chain are colored in dark and light purple, respectively, and the central Trp535 residue is depicted in stick representation. (E) Representation of steric clashes upon simultaneous receptor and antibody binding. Since the binding site of the carbohydrate moiety completely overlaps with the Fab-binding site, simultaneous binding is sterically not feasible.",
