European ethnoveterinary research has been performed mainly in Mediterranean countries (Blanco et al., 1999; Uncini Manganelli et al., 2001; Viegi et al., 2003; Scherrer et al., 2005; Pieroni et al., 2004, 2006; Bonet and Valles, 2007; Akerreta et al., 2010; Benitez et al., 2012; Mayer et al., 2014; Bullitta et al., 2018), in the German speaking parts of the European Alps (Schmid et al., 2012; Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Vogl et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019), and some in eastern European countries (Mayer et al., 2014), notably Romania (Bartha et al., 2015).

On a global scale it is estimated that antimicrobials used in livestock production will increase by 67% from approximately 63\u2032000 tons per year in 2010 to 106\u2032000 tons by 2030 (Van Boeckel et al., 2015). The major classes of antimicrobials used for humans are also used in livestock, including reserve antibiotics (Aarestrup et al., 2008). In Europe the use of antimicrobials is highest with intensive livestock species such as pigs, poultry and young cattle (European Medicines Agency, 2014; Federal Food Savety and Veterinary Office, 2019), mainly for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases (Bennett et al., 1999). In adult cattle mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases (Bradley, 2002), and is oftentimes treated with antibiotics.",

(7 UR), Calendula officinalis L., and Hypericum perforatum L.. In category QM, Arnica montana L., Harpagophytum procumbens (Burch.) DC ex Meisn., Equisetum arvense L., and Zingiber officinale Roscoe were used to treat sprains and degenerative joint diseases. In category QR, Phyllitis scolop\u00e9ndrium (L.) Newman was used to treat cough, whereby the dried plant was directly administered orally. In vitro antimicrobial activity of Phyllitis scolop\u00e9ndrium (L.) Newman against pathogenic bacteria has been reported (Ferrazzano et al., 2013). Additional plants species mentioned in category QR were Abies alba Mill. and Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck.",

The phytochemistry, pharmacological properties, and therapeutic effectiveness is documented with numerous research publications and reviews (Ayrle et al., 2016a; Tresch et al., 2019). The use of complementary medicine and homemade remedies by farmers may help to lower the use of antibiotics (Maeschli et al., 2019). However, medicinal plants cannot replace antibiotics and other modern veterinary medicinal products, not the least for reasons of animal welfare. Nevertheless, a meaningful use of medicinal plants by veterinarians may limit the use of antibiotics and other modern veterinary medicinal products to particularly severe diseases. More clinical veterinary studies with medicinal plants are needed, and veterinary education as well as national strategies to control and combat the development of microbial resistance should take into account the use of medicinal plants as a means to reduce the use of antibiotics (StAR, 2015).",

Of these, 18 were mentioned for the first time in a Swiss ethnoveterinary context. We found no obvious difference in ethnoveterinary knowledge between French and German native speakers. The most widely used plants are easily available and well known for human and veterinary purposes. Taking into account the current phytochemical knowledge, and in vitro and in vivo studies, several plants reported by farmers could be considered as promising treatment options for gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses. The use of such plants and finished products could help to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the use of antibiotics. Thus, our findings may contribute to international strategies for limiting the use of antibiotics.",
