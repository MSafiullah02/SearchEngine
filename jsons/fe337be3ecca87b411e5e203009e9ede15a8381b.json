The MDG 7, to ensure environmental sustainability, has the target 7C, which states 'halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation'. Indicators for this target are the proportion of the population using an improved drinking water source and the proportion of the population using an improved sanitation facility (United Nations Children's Fund 2006) . Many villages in Kompong Thom province of Cambodia are on track to meet this target; households have installed protected wells and improved latrines. The presence of the household improved latrine is a proxy indicator for basic sanitation in the household. The improved latrine represents a barrier to the environmen-tal transmission of pathogens and is more likely to be sanitary than unimproved latrines or the absence of a latrine (United Nations Childrens Fund 2006) .",

Methods and Results: This study monitored the numbers of faecal coliforms (i.e. thermotolerant coliforms), total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic plate count bacteria on household surfaces in a rural village of Cambodia. Faecal coliform levels in Cambodia were highest on moist locations such as the plastic ladle used for sink water, the toilet seat surface and the cutting board surface with 100-fold higher levels of faecal coliform bacteria than E. coli and 100-fold higher levels of faecal coliforms than the US and Japanese studies. Conclusions: A single public health intervention barrier, such as an improved latrine, is only partially effective for household sanitation. For complete sanitation, multiple environmental barriers may be necessary. These barriers occur in a house constructed with easily washable surfaces, a chlorinated water distribution system, house climate control and cleaning product availability. Significance and Impact of the Study: Results of this study can be used to emphasize the importance of increasing household environmental sanitation barriers.",

            "text": "2005). Because many microbes are capable of causing infections at low doses (Sinclair et al. 2008) , pathogens can survive for hours to weeks on surfaces such as cutting boards and bathroom floors. Fomites have been proposed as a significant transmission route for outbreaks such as the SARS virus, which is known to survive up to 96 h (Duan et al. 2003) or longer on surfaces with moisture and biological substances. They are also believed to play a significant role in the transmission of other respiratory and enteric infections (Boone and Gerba 2007) and foodborne illness in the home (Scott 1996) . Households in Kompong Thom province, Cambodia, were monitored for the numbers of faecal coliforms (i.e. thermotolerant coliforms), total coliforms and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria on the surfaces outlined in a similar USA-based study (Rusin et al. 1998) . The objectives of the study were to (i) assess kitchen and bathroom surface contamination to provide information regarding the areas of greatest potential exposure and public health risk in a developing country household, (ii) establish a baseline data set to be used for a later public health hand-washing intervention and (iii) determine whether surfaces in rural Cambodian homes with 'improved sanitation' have similar contamination levels to homes in other countries. Such information could be used in a health education programme to aid in educational efforts focusing on hand washing, use of household disinfectants or other hygiene and sanitation practices.",

Once this was performed, E. coli and total coliform in Petrifilm media were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in a portable incubator. Positive E. coli were identified by a blue colony with the formation of gas. Red colonies with gas were identified as total coliform. Red or blue colonies without gas were not counted. The HPC Petrifilm media followed a similar protocol, but were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 days. For faecal coliforms, a me mbrane-filter faecal coliform (MFC) agar (Difco) was prepared and poured onto plastic Petri dishes. A spot plate method was used (Miles and Misra 1938) , where a volume of 50 ll was placed as a drop on the solid agar and allowed to dry into the agar. Up to four spots per dilution were applied to the plates. Each sample was replicated in at least triplicate using Pet- rifilm and up to four replicates for spot plates. The study's standard operating procedure included the use of a sampling data entry form, a study protocol, positive controls to validate the sampling method and negative controls to detect any field sampling errors. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2003 to compute measures of mean, geometric mean and standard deviation. To assess the difference from the United States to Cambodia, t-tests were conducted using Microsoft Excel's data analysis tool pack.",

The highest faecal coliform contamination levels in Cambodia were on the ladle for sink water, the toilet seat surface and the cutting board surface, all moist locations ( Table 2 ). The ladle for sink water had highest faecal coliform contamination. This is expected, as it is the comparable surface to the kitchen faucet handle in the US study. The cutting board was also highly contaminated in Cambodian homes. The cutting board is usually moist and had some food items near or on the board at the time of sampling. Similarly, the top of the squat-style toilet was highly contaminated with faecal coliforms. These ceramic pour-flush bowls are manufactured with two positions on either side of the toilet bowl for the user's feet. Although made from the same smooth ceramic material as the bowl, the tread positions have grooves where water can pool allowing the area to be moister than the surrounding floor. Unlike the US study, the bathroom floor had the highest amount of HPC bacteria, but not faecal coliforms. Overall, the Cambodian study had over 100-fold higher concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria than E. coli and over 100fold higher concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria than the US study.",

Through a subsidy programme with the NGO ADRA, all houses had a pour-flush latrine built from cement or a cement-wood combination (Fig. 1) . These were white ceramic pour-flush latrines, which are most suitable where people use water for anal cleansing and squat to defecate. These latrines were built with a cement septic tank and PVC plumbing. The septic tank was built from circular cement rings, which are also used to line wells. Three of the eight houses had a separate wash or bathing room next to the room with the pourflush latrine. In four of the eight houses, children were seen going in and out of the latrine, indicating regular use by the household. Five latrines had a pair of sandals near the doorstep for use while using the latrine. Latrines and bathrooms were kept relatively clean, but no soap or other cleaning material was seen with the exception of powdered laundry detergent at one house. Dishes are washed with plastic scrub brush in large plastic basins with water, which was obtained from the onsite well. The dishes are then air-dried on a rack and sometimes wiped with a rag designated for the kitchen. There was a plastic ladle cup, which is used to transfer water to the dish washing basins. This cup was reported to be a multitasking tool, where it is used to wash dishes, wash clothes, prepare food and occasionally used as a cup for drinking water. Soap was seen in only one of the houses and was a powdered laundry detergent. This type of soap is used for washing laundry, dishes and hands. No bar soap or other form was seen. Bathing and showers occasionally take place in the built bathroom located outside of the house, but more commonly using a bucket while standing next to their household well and wearing the traditional Kramah sarong. Although no pets were reported, many pigs, chickens, stray dogs and cats were seen in the all of the house yards.",

Salmonella was also common and high numbers of E. coli were found on the kitchen sink surfaces, suggestive of active bacterial growth (Scott et al. 1982) . The England study found frequent contamination of dishcloths and other wet cleaning utensils. Authors of the England study suggested that these cleaning items might be reservoirs and also disseminators of contamination in the kitchen. As discussed previously, the US study also found that the kitchen is the most contaminated site with the toilet seat being the least contaminated (Rusin et al. 1998 ).",

This multiple barrier system is detailed in a discussion of the environmental infection transmission system model (Li et al. 2009 ), which considers physical proximity, microbe pick-up rate, pathogen elimination rate, deposition rate and social encounters. A complete hygiene intervention focusing on the control of these sources of contamination is rare, while a single pathway model is much more common (Eisenberg et al. 2007 ). The Cambodian village homes in this study were selected because they use a pour-flush latrine as a single barrier for environmental pathogen transmission. Results from this study demonstrate that a single barrier is not effective for household sanitation. When compared to the eight homes in Cambodia, homes in industrialized countries (i.e. United States and Japan) have additional environmental barriers that may control fomite contamination. The most effective barriers are thought to be the chlorinated water distribution system, a solid waste disposal system, a more elaborate home construction with easily washable surfaces and cleaning product availability. In addition, homes in these countries have indoor climate control systems and lower relative indoor humidity than tropical Cambodia. In any hygiene and sanitation improvement programme, an effort should be made to include as many pathogen control points as possible. What is often left out of public health interventions is an assessment of fomite contamination as an indicator of improved household sanitation. The swab and indicator bacteria methods described in this paper can be used as monitoring tools to identify the greatest potential exposure and public health risk. Further studies in Cambodia could combine the protein and biochemical marker investigations as described by Reynolds (Reynolds et al. 2005 ) with a fullscale investigation into household hygiene including subtopics on solid waste, surface disinfection and fomite contamination. Additional studies should investigate these topics among households in varying socio-economic classes, varying house construction types and the different types of well and latrine designs as defined by UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund 2006).",

The high contamination found in households was easily quantified by local NGO staff and can be used as a baseline for the planned handwashing intervention. The study determined that contamination levels in rural villages are much higher than contamination in US households. An additional benefit of the study was the interest of the villagers in their own home's contamination level. If followed up, this stakeholder interest can lead to a successful public health education campaign on hand washing, cleaning products or other component.",
