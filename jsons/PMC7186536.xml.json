However, exclusion of hospital practitioners reversed the trend, as the majority of community and private ophthalmologists (n = 31, 55.3%) were not aware of such guidelines (P = 0.006).

In this survey-based study, we obtained the opinions of Israeli ophthalmologists regarding the risk of ophthalmologic practice during the local early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Responses were received from ophthalmologists in many departments in Israeli hospitals as well as health maintenance organizations and private clinics providing a highly representative sample. At the time of the survey, 3 weeks after the first reported case of COVID-19 in Israel, most ophthalmologists reported starting to utilize PPE during routine clinic visits. Many reported the need to obtain PPE independently, including ophthalmologists working in hospital settings. A large number of practitioners described not being informed of official COVID-19 clinic guidelines, especially ophthalmologists practicing in busy outpatient clinics of health maintenance organizations (Kupat Holim). The majority of respondents were of the opinion that clinic and surgical services should have been reduced to emergency services only.

As of the end of March, the international pandemic has progressed, and more than sixty physicians in Italy have already died, and many others in Europe and in the USA have tested positive for the virus [14]. The best explanation to why otherwise healthy individuals would succumb to the infection is related to the extent of the viral load on exposure and the mass of the COVID-19 inoculum [15]. This can be greatly reduced by utilization of proper PPE [16], specifically N-95 masks, while performing invasive ophthalmologic procedures and the greater use of COVID-19 testing to identify patients with the viral infection. A promising advance is the use of antibody testing to identify physicians and healthcare workers who possess immunity to the virus, enabling these individuals to treat patients while ensuring their own safety [17]. As of April 6th, for the Israeli population estimated at 8,972,000 as of 2019, there are presently 8904 individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19, 56 of whom have died [18]. To our knowledge, there is one ophthalmologist who has tested positive for COVID 19. Routine testing of physicians is not presently being provided.",

Firstly, due to the rapid unfolding of events related to an increasing number of individuals with COVID-19 infection, several hours after the survey was released, the Israeli Health Ministry announced its intention to cease all non-urgent ambulatory services and surgeries beginning March 22. Previous to this, no restriction of ambulatory services had been considered. Secondly, the number of respondents was limited to ~ 25% of practicing ophthalmologists due to the need to limit the access of the survey to 72 h to reflect the changing healthcare environment.",

The findings from this questionnaire-based study show that at the onset of the pandemic in Israel, ophthalmologists described themselves as inadequately protected from COVID 19 infection and felt a lack of support. It is notable that the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, was initially identified by an ophthalmologist, Dr. Li Wenliang, who at 33 years of age contracted the virus in the early days of the outbreak and recently died of the disease [19]. Both his story and this survey emphasize the importance of attending to the safety of healthcare workers. For the first time in the lives of most physicians, the routine care of patients becomes a personal health care risk. As a result, physicians must prioritize their own health and safety as they continue to care for their patients.",
