These measures help in the deployment of appropriate therapeutic interventions, thus ensuring effective management and control of disease. In the past, the commonly employed viral detection methods were either cell-culture or molecule-level assay based. Most of these assays are laborious and expensive, require special facilities, and provide a slow diagnosis. Biosensor-based approaches largely circumvent these limitations and therefore provide an attractive alternative as validated after successful commercialization of glucose and other biosensors.",

            "text": "In light of continuously emerging new viral strains, precise, timely and cost-effective viral diagnosis has become an important factor for the effective management of viral disease. The past decades have seen a spurt in the development of antiviral therapies and diagnostic protocols as against conventional culture-based methods. Viral diagnosis can be performed by direct or indirect methods. Direct methods look for intact viruses or viral nucleic acids or proteins. Indirect methods involve culturing of clinical samples followed by infection of cells, eggs or animals to isolate viruses. These viruses are then confirmed via serological detection methods utilizing antibodies against viral antigens induced by viral infection. Indirect methods of viral diagnosis include complement fixation tests, the hemagglutination inhibition test, immunofluorescence, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the Western blot assay. However, these methods have inherent disadvantages as they are limited to laboratories, are time consuming, lack sensitivity, and most importantly, may not identify newly emerging viral strains. Examples include Zika virus, swine and bird flu viruses, Nipah virus, and Chikungunya virus. These issues are largely circumvented by molecular diagnostic protocols based on nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) test. Molecular diagnostics rely on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplifies the viral DNA or RNA using (RT-)PCR. This protocol has successfully addressed the diagnostic issues for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Mulder et al., 1994), hepatitis B and C viruses (Berger et al., 1998), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Boeckh and Boivin, 1998; Pavel et al., 2016). Timely and precise diagnosis provided via PCR has made this technique a gold standard for viral diagnosis. PCR is further improvised and diversified to nested-PCR, real-time PCR, digital PCR ligase chain reaction, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification methods, etc. However, PCR-based molecular diagnostics have their share of pitfalls as well, including requirements for well-equipped laboratory facilities and qualified and trained personal as well as high costs. Optical biosensors have removed these disadvantages as they offer a rapid, cost effective, sensitive, label free, reproducible method for diagnosing a particular virus. Due to their many advantages, optical biosensors are increasingly used in a variety of clinical and nonclinical applications. A wide array of analytes that includes toxins, drugs, antibodies, tumour biomarkers, tumour cells and intact viruses can be detected in highly sensitive and selective manner. This article will focus on the detection protocols for intact viruses that utilize antibody, glycan and aptamer based bioreceptor surfaces. The current review highlights progress and development toward the detection of intact viruses. Additionally, this article emphasizes description and examples of applications of optical biosensors in medicine, with special reference to viral diagnostics.",

The biorecognition elements used by biosensors are generally biological materials, including enzymes, antibodies, antigens, receptors, nucleic acids, whole cells and tissues. Based on the signal transduction method utilized, biosensors can be grouped into different categories: optical, electrochemical, thermometric, piezoelectric, and magnetic. Among these, optical biosensors are the most common. Optical biosensors utilize the interaction of optical fields (i.e., the electric field) with the analyte for optical detection. Optical biosensing can be performed in a label-free or label-based manner. Label-free protocols involve interaction of the analyte with the transducer for signal detection while label-based protocols label the analyte and the optical signal is generated by colorimetric, fluorescent or luminescent methods (Damborsk\u00fd et al., 2016).",

Kinetic and equilibrium analyses are used to characterize bimolecular interaction (ligand\u2013analyte binding, antibody\u2013antigen interaction, receptor characterization etc.) in a label-free, real-time manner (Fig. 1\n). Concentration analysis of an analyte can also be done using SPR, provided a specific ligand is available and it can be immobilized on a sensor chip surface. Concentration is then quantified by the measurement of direct binding or from the rate of binding in mass transport limited mode. Concentration analysis has applications in healthcare, biopharmaceutical production, clinical point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, environmental analysis, food monitoring, defense and security (Singh, 2014, Singh, 2016a). SPR analyses were utilized to diagnose different stages of Epstein\u2013Barr virus through detection of antibodies against different antigens present in the virus (Riedel et al., 2014). SPR-based food monitoring includes detection of antibiotics in milk samples (using a portable six-channel SPR sensor) and mycotoxin patulin (immunochemical SPR) (Hunt and Armani, 2010; Damborsk\u00fd et al., 2016). SPR was also utilized to monitor the binding kinetics of dengue antibody with corresponding dengue antigen in real-time manner (Jahanshahi et al., 2016).",

This technique finds useful applications in the study of DNA-protein interactions, toxins, proteins and vesicles. Sensor miniaturization can go down to scales unapproachable by other planar microfabrication/microlithography techniques. Also unique to LSPR is the nanoplasmonic resonance condition, which is satisfied in a simple reflected or transmitted light geometry, common to both microscopy and spectroscopy applications, whereas SPR excitation requires incident light that is totally internally reflected. This has given impetus to the LSPR spectroscopy and imaging (LSPRi) integrated into live-cell microscopy studies for the detection of secreted proteins while simultaneously imaging the cells with more traditional techniques such as fluorescence and bright field (Singh, 2016b) (Fig. 3\n). Takemura et al. (2017) have developed a LSPR-induced immunofluorescence nanobiosensor for ultrasensitive, rapid and specific detection of influenza virus and norovirus-like particles (NoV-LPs). This platform is based on a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-induced quantum dot (QD) fluorescence signal. The mechanism involves conjugation of an anti-neuraminidase (NA) antibody (anti-NA Ab) to thiolated AuNPs and the conjugation of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (anti-HA Ab) to alloyed quaternary l-cysteine-capped CdSeTeS QDs. A hot-injection organometallic route was employed for alloyed quaternary CdSeTeS QDs synthesis followed by capping with l-cysteine via a ligand exchange reaction. Similarly, AuNPs were synthesized in HEPES buffer and thiolated with l-cysteine.

PAMONO sensors are ideal for detection and quantification of intact viruses, virus like particles (VLP), nano-vesicles, extracellular vesicles (EVs) and inorganic nanoparticles (NP) (Im et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2014, Shpacovitch et al., 2015; Fig. 4, Fig. 5\n). EVs facilitate intracellular communication and information exchange within an organism. PAMONO sensors provide for the imaging of EVs in a real-time, label-free manner without requiring advanced technology for the preparation of sensor slides (Gyorgy et al., 2011; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015; Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In a study, PAMONO sensors were utilized to analyze the detection and quantification of microvesicles (MVs). This involved real-time binding analysis of individual MVs to the sensor surface functionalized by protein A/protein G and anti-target antibody. This binding was followed by elution of MVs from the sensor surface for post-PAMONO analysis of their content, which may act as an indicator of disease status. PAMONO sensor-based diagnostic platforms may help in the analysis of liquid biopsy samples in which the pattern of MV size distribution is indicative of different cargos being ferried.",

            "text": "Aptamers are oligonucleotides or peptide molecules that bind to specific target molecules. These are produced by in vitro genetic selection that involves isolation from a library of nucleic acids through the process of selection and amplification. Aptamers bind with high affinity and specificity that could surpass the affinity obtained between antibody-antigen binding. In comparison with antibodies, aptamers are smaller in size, easy to synthesize, lack toxicity and immunogenicity. Aptamers therefore find useful application in the fields of imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutics (Misono and Kumar, 2005, Gopinath et al., 2006, Gopinath et al., 2008, Gopinath et al., 2012, Gopinath et al., 2013, Cho et al., 2009, Keefe et al., 2010, Park et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2013, Suenaga and Kumar, 2014, Dougherty et al., 2015). Aptamers are available against corresponding cognate targets that include ions, small molecules, peptides, proteins, viruses and organelles. Aptamers have been isolated against surface proteins of human pathogenic virus (Gopinath, 2007, Shum et al., 2013). Interestingly, some of these aptamers are able to distinguish very closely related families and subtypes (Misono and Kumar, 2005, Gopinath et al., 2006, Gopinath et al., 2013, Park et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2013, Suenaga and Kumar, 2014, Dougherty et al., 2015; Penmetcha, 2016). High affinity aptamers can be used for the direct detection of intact viruses in virus-contaminated samples. Aptamer-based bioreceptor surfaces have been increasingly used with SPR and other sensing platforms (Fig. 6\n).",

There are 18 different known H antigens (H1 to H18) and 11 different known N antigens (N1 to N11). Influenza virus was first isolated from a Peruvian bat (Tong et al., 2013; Fig. 7\n). In a study, a DNA aptamer was selected against HA of avian influenza virus. It discriminated against all other strains of H5N1 and subtypes of influenza virus (Gopinath and Kumar, 2013; Wang et al., 2013). This aptamer was utilized as a biorecognition surface in a SPR sensing system for detection and evaluation of specific avian flu viruses. The analysis gave the concentration of targeted avian influenza virus expressed as hemagglutination unit (HAU) while non-targeted influenza viruses elicited an insignificant response signal (Bai et al., 2012). Similarly, avian influenza virus titers were estimated from poultry swab samples in an hour, which is considerably less than conventional approaches. However, multiple samples cannot be analyzed via this method due to limitations of regenerating the sensor surface. This limitation could be circumvented by using an agent that facilitates simple and quick regeneration of sensor surface that could restore the sensor efficiency without impairing the efficiency of the sensor chip (Bai et al., 2012). In a study, regeneration of the sensor surface involved immobilization of streptavidin (SA) on the CM5 chip, anti-influenza virus (H3N2)-aptamer and bioinylated oligo with different amount (HAU) of influenza virus. Plotting the response signals with HAU of influenza virus showed a linear response and the chip was used for more than 90 cycles. Signal and sensitivity could further be increased by using shorter dextrans and self-assembled monolayers (SAM), thus indicating that a shorter chain length SAM provides a better choice for analyzing intact viruses (Gopinath et al., 2006; Fig. 6).",

The metallic silver changes the refractive index of gold, causing a blue shift of LSPR, with a linear range of 0.1\u20135 mU/ml (corresponding to viral antigen concentrations of 0.001\u20132.5 ng/ml) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.086 mU/ml. This method provides higher sensitivity than gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Au NBPs also overcome the limitation of poor monodipersity of AuNPs with sharp edges (Singh, 2016a, Xu et al., 2017). AuNBPs show better properties in terms of plasmon peak width, refractive index sensitivity, figure of merit, two photon photoluminescence and Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).",

These chips can differentiate between surface adsorption and insertion into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Besenicar et al., 2006, Singh, 2017). A study using SPR applied a rigid artificial membrane system on the sensor surface to unravel the mechanisms of the HIV fusion inhibitors sifuvirtide and enfuvirtide binding to the membrane. The new fusion inhibitor laid its focus on the HR1 region of gp41 (Dwyer et al., 2008, Naito et al., 2009, Nishikawa et al., 2009). Both sifuvirtide and enfuvirtide interact with the lipid membranes; however, interaction with other lipids like sphingomyelin (SM), characteristics of viral envelopes and lipid rafts is not fully understood (Simons and Vaz, 2004; Veiga et al., 2004; Brugger et al., 2006, Brugger et al., 2007; Waheed and Freed, 2009; Franquelim et al., 2008, 2010). SPR studies have shown that sifuvirtide might interact with membrane system by surface adsorption and it might get inserted into the outer leaflets of SM bilayers. HIV membranes have several-fold higher SM and saturated phosphocholine (PC) relative to the eukaryotic membranes. SPR analysis has shown that sifuvirtide has 32-fold higher affinity for saturated phospholipids like DPCC than POPC, suggesting its capacity to bind saturated phospholipid in a selective manner (Brugger et al., 2006; Franquelim et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2017).",

Sifuvirtide is clinically more effective as compared to enfuvirtide, largely due to its adsorption on rigid lipids like DPPC and SM on the viral envelop, the site where most of the fusion-related glycoprotein receptors are inserted (Chungen et al., 2009; Franquelim et al., 2010; Veiga et al., 2004; Ping et al., 2010; Brugger et al., 2006; Sargent and Schwyzer, 1986). However, both can combine together to exert a synergistic effect in HIV inhibition (Pan et al., 2009). Findings from SPR-based studies have revealed the mode of interaction of peptide-HIV fusion inhibitors with biomembrane systems and the importance of rigid lipids that act as the additional targets of HIV fusion inhibitors (Besenicar et al., 2006).",

All of these serotypes can lead to the full spectrum of disease, i.e., Dengue fever. Dengue virus has a genome size of 11 kbp of positive single-stranded RNA genome that encodes structural (capsid protein C, membrane protein M, envelope protein E) and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010). Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of Dengue virus is a conserved glycoprotein that interacts with the membrane and is secreted into the plasma of Dengue infected patients. NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway involving the important complement-regulator prote in vitro nectin (VN). A study by Conde et al. (2016) has characterized the NS1-VN interaction through ELISA and SPR. Mechanistic details show that NS1 alone or in conjugation with VN inhibits the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) and C9 polymerization. The findings from the study indicate the role of NS1 as a terminal inhibitor of the complement system (Conde et al., 2016).",

Among the diverse array of surface receptors, homodimeric Ly49 receptors regulate the activity of NK cells by sensing major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC-I). However, the mechanism of binding is yet to be understood. A study has evaluated and characterized the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the interaction of NK Ly49 receptors and MHC-I ligands. Results show that interactions are diffusion controlled and enthalpy driven in contracts with the activation-controlled and entropy-driven interactions between Ly49s with the viral immune-evasin m157. This mechanistic difference is attributed to the different functional responses, for example, one where NK cells scan for killing the virus infected cells and the other to escape the immune-evasins like m157 by virus (Takemura et al., 2017).",

Of these, aptamer-based bioreceptor surfaces have been increasingly used with SPR and other sensing platforms. Schofield and Dimmock have pioneered the analysis of intact virus using SPR (Schofield and Dimmock, 1996). They immobilized a mAb (HC10 recognizing hemagglutinin HA derived from influenza virus, A/fowl plague/Rostock/34 (H7N1)) via amine coupling on a CM5 sensor chip. Results have established the protocol, where the interaction of entire viral particles having dimension of 120 nm with mAb could be monitored. Since then many plant and animal viruses have been analyzed using SPR systems (Hardy and Dimmock, 2003, Boltovets et al., 2004, Baac et al., 2006, Nilsson et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010, Chenail et al., 2011, Yakes et al., 2013). Another study reported quantification of influenza virus based on inhibition of HA antibody binding (Nilsson et al., 2010). This method was found to be several-fold more sensitive than an immunodiffusion assay.",

These biosensors are very promising for the detection of wide range of viruses. However, use of antibodies for biorecoginition for binding to viral surface proteins has limitations, as the sensitivity is entirely decided by the affinity and stability of antibodies, which may also show cross reactivity with other proteins. There might be variability in different batches of antibodies, and the stability of an antibody may decrease during the course of analysis. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the sensitivity and specificity of these sensors (Baker, 2015).",

            "text": "Norovirus is highly infectious and can cause acute gastroenteritis infection in all age groups with a relatively low viral load (<20 virus particles) (Morillo and Timenetsky, 2011). Norovirus shows huge diversity, displaying more than 33 genotypes, thus necessitating a diagnostic device with the ability to detect all the available genotypes of the virus (Kageyama et al., 2004). However, the strain GII.4 is responsible for most of the epidemics, indicating its persistence in the population. It can cause re-infection or affect individuals infected with similar or different strains in the previous exposure. The emergence of new mutations in the P2 subdomain of P domain of the virus capsid protein results in altered antigenicity and binding properties with histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), resulting in new strains causing epidemics (Allen et al., 2008, Allen et al., 2009; Shanker et al., 2011; Debbink et al., 2012; Eden et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2014). Lack of in vivo disease models and reproducible in vitro replication systems has hindered the study of norovirus (Jiang et al., 1992, Tan et al., 2003, Tan and Jiang, 2005, Siebenga et al., 2007, Lindesmith et al., 2008, Lindesmith et al., 2011). Immunoassay-based detection of norovirus is not feasible as developing corresponding antibodies for different antigens related with different genotypes is not possible. Recently, cross-reactive antibodies for different genotypes of norovirus were isolated (Higo-Moriguchi et al., 2014). In a recent work, cross-reactive antibodies for various genotypes of norovirus have been isolated (Higo-Moriguchi et al., 2014). Surface plasmon resonance-assisted fluoroimmunoassay (SPRF), or surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS) provide extremely sensitive biosensing platforms (Attridge et al., 1991; Libermann and Knoll, 2000; Roy et al., 2002; Toma et al., 2013). SPRF works through electric field induction via SPR using a fluorescent label. This sensor excites quantum dot florescent dyes by SPR induced electric field on an aluminum film. A study has developed a compact and sensitive V-trench biosensor for onsite detection of norovirus (Nomura et al., 2013; Ashiba et al., 2017; Fig. 8, Fig. 9\n). However, evaluating higher concentrations of norovirus in the environment will require further sensitivity enhancement for SPRF to distinguish between multiple similar or related strains. This study utilized a fluorescent label with large Stokes shift and quantum dot fluorescent label to increase the sensitivity. Detection of norovirus was done involving sandwich assay with phosphonic acid, SAM and cross-reactive antibodies. This platform was found applicable to all the genotypes of norovirus, while captured antibody was reactive to genogroup II and detection antibody to 13 genotypes in genogroup I and II.",

SARS-CoV is an RNA virus sharing very little homology with other CoVs (Holmes, 2003). Two proteases in SARS-CoV, namely 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are conserved across the CoV genera and serve as a crucial antiviral targets as they are cleaved to generate mature active proteins (Anand et al., 2003, Stadler et al., 2003). Polyphenols are potent inhibitors of these protease though more strongly affecting PLpro than 3CLpro. SPR was utilized to investigate the structural properties that impart polyphenols with this characteristic. Using SPR, PLpro was immobilized on the sensor chip and the test compounds were allowed to pass over the sensor surface to check the interaction. The study shows polyphenols from Broussonetia papyrifera have inhibitory activity against CoV proteases. This inhibitory action stems from the number of prenyl groups present in the polyphenol (Fernandes et al., 1991, Papandreou et al., 2002, van de Laar et al., 2005; Whitby et al., 2005; Ryu et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2013; Ji-Young et al., 2017). The SPR-based investigation identified the most potent anti-CoV agent.",

Zika virus spreads infection through daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti and A. albopictus (Fig. 11\n). From the time of its origin, it was confined to the equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. However, it is now showing an eastward spread across the Pacific Ocean to the western hemisphere, leading to epidemics, particularly in Latin America. A recent pandemic of Zika virus has posed a serious threat due to its role in development of severe fetal abnormalities. The situation has become so alarming that Brazil, where this virus emerged most strongly has declared that women should avoid conceiving until the threat is over. SPR-based binding studies involving Zika virus envelop protein to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were examined in real-time to elucidate the role of GAGs in cell entry, placenta and brain. Envelop protein binds strongly to heparin, which is a highly sulfated GAG, suggesting electrostatic interactions. SPR-based competition assays utilizing variable chain length heparin oligosaccharides show that envelop binds strongly with longer heparin oligosaccharides. This study highlights the role of GAGs as attachment factors to reveal the mechanism of pathogen entry (Kim et al., 2017).",

E1, through its fusion peptide, initiates membrane fusion, releasing nucleocapsids into the host cytoplasm and causing infection (Caglioti et al., 2013). The binding of transmembrane glycoprotein E2 with capsid proteins in a hydrophobic pocket plays a crucial role in the Alphavirus life cycle. A study has characterized the interaction of dioxane-based derivatives like picolinic acid in the conserved hydrophobic pocket of capsid protein by SPR, ITC and fluorescence spectroscopy.

This is particularly important in wake of continuously emerging newer and more virulent strains of virus. Rapid evolution of virus has outpaced the conventional surveillance protocols like antigenic, serological and agglutination assays, which lack robustness, reproducibility, simplicity and shelf-life. Current need is for a protocol that is rapid, portable and cost-effective, with high sensitivity and specificity. In this regard, optical biosensors that feature portability, sensor miniaturization, and the ability to screen many samples at a time are finding more use in biomedical diagnostics as compared to other comparable techniques that lack miniaturization and high throughput. Surface Plasmon resonance is particularly important as it offers highly sensitive and specific kinetic analysis of biomolecular interaction in label-free manner. However, optical biosensors require highly trained manpower, advance laboratory infrastructure, which might be a limiting factor for resource-constrained setups in developing or under developed countries or in far-flung remote areas. Therefore, there is a need to rationalize and improvise the optical biosensing platforms in terms of portability, cost involved, affordability, user-friendliness and ready-to-use mode.
