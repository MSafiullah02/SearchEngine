            "text": "ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTP-binding proteins that have an essential function in intracellular trafficking and organelle structure. To date, little information is available on the Arfs in the economically important giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii and their relationship to viral infection. Here we identified two Arf genes from M. rosenbergii (MrArf1 and MrArf2) for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MrArf1, together with MjArf1 from shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus belonged to Class I Arfs. By contrast, MrArf2 didn't not match any of the Arfs classes of I/II/III, although it could be clustered with an Arf protein from M. japonicas called MjArfn, which may represent an analog of the Arf. MrArf1 was ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues, with the highest transcription level in the hepatopancreas, whereas MrArf2 was only highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and exhibited very low levels in the stomach and intestines. In addition, the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection model of the prawn was also established. The virus proliferated obviously in the gills and hepatopancreas 48 h after infection. The relative mRNA expressions of MrArf1 in the gills and hepatopancreas also increased significantly after WSSV challenge, and all reached the maximal level at 48 h as the same trend of WSSV proliferation. However, MrArf2 transcript showed no obvious change in the gill, but increased significantly in the hepatopancreas 24 h after infection. RNAi results showed that knockdown of MrArf1 or MrArf2 could inhibit the expression of the envelope protein gene vp28 of the WSSV. So, it could be speculated that MrArf1 and MrArf2 might facilitate WSSV infection.",

Regards, and best wishes, Yours Sincerely, Qianren Cover Letter Title: Characterization of two novel ADP ribosylation factors from giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii and their responses to WSSV challenge Developmental & Comparative Immunology Reviewers' comments: Reviewer #1: The manuscript reported two ADP-ribosylation factor genes from giant freshwater prawn. The results about their molecular features, mRNA expression profiles were of interest for the DCI readers. Considering the submission is a short communication, the length of the manuscript should be condensed, and the irrelevance part, such as WSSV infection model of the prawn, should be removed. Answer: Thank you so much for your suggestions! We have revised the MS according to your comments. Please see the following. Major comments 1. The innovation about the features and mRNA expressions of these two genes is limited in the present study. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are not necessary for the paper, the access No. is enough. The comparative function analysis of these two genes should be addressed in the present study. But I do not think the results of RNAi experiments in the present study are enough to conclude that MrArf1 and MrArf2 facilitate WSSV infection. Answer: Now the former Fig.1 was used as \"Supplement 4\" and Fig. 2 was removed. The comparative function analysis about the MrArf1, MrArf2 and other Arfs were addressed from the new lines 313 to 329. Considering that the RNAi experiment could give us some useful information about the roles of MrArf1 and MrArf2 during WSSV infection and the comparative analysis of existing Arfs, we'd like to keep this part, but the description was changed into \"So, it could be speculated that MrArf1 and *Response to Reviewers * * Supplement 4. qRT-PCR analysis of MrArf1 (A) and MrArf2 (B) in the heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach and intestine of M. rosenbergii. * * Fig. 1.

In addition to a relative lack of novelty-many other studies have already shown that the ADP ribosylation factors are triggered after WSSV infection in shrimp-my main concern is that some of the data are unclear, the rationale for using gill tissue is never explained, and some of the controls are inadequate.

The expression level of MrArf1 in the gills was down-regulated post 24 h 44 WSSV challenge, and reached the maximal level at 48 h. MrArf1 in the 45 hepatopancreas went up from 24 to 48 h WSSV challenge. MrArf2 transcript in the 46 gill also went down at 24 h and then was upregulated at 48 h WSSV challenge. 47 MrArf2 increased significantly in the hepatopancreas 24 h after infection and then 48 went down at 48 h WSSV challenge. RNAi results showed that knockdown of MrArf1 49 or MrArf2 could inhibit the expression of the envelope protein gene vp28 of the 50 WSSV. So, it could be speculated that MrArf1 and MrArf2 might play important roles 51 in the innate immune system against WSSV infection. 52 Keywords: Macrobrachium rosenbergii; ADP ribosylation factor; after its first discovery in Asia in the early 1990s, the white spot 63 syndrome virus (WSSV) developed into an epizootic disease. WSSV is currently 64 found in most crustacean farming areas in the world, where it causes large economic 65 losses to the aquaculture industry. Aside from its economic effect, the disease also 66 poses a threat to natural marine and freshwater ecology (Jiravanichpaisal et al., 2004; 67 Nambi et al., 2012). As such, understanding the molecular mechanism of the innate 68 immune defense against virus infection is imperative. Recent studies have 69 demonstrated that the small GTPases found in shrimp participate in antiviral 70 immunity by regulating phagocytosis (Liu et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). In Drosophila 71 S2 cells (Schneider line 2), Ran protein, a small Ras-like GTPase, was involved in the 72 regulation of phagocytosis against Drosophila C virus (DCV). Some members of the 73 ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) found in mammals (Nie et al., 2003; D'Souza-Schorey 74 and Chavrier, 2006) and the shrimp Marsupeneaus japonicas (Wang et al., 2009; Ma 75 et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010), which are classified with small GTP-binding proteins 76 (~ 21 kDa) involved in virus infection. The relationship between various Arfs and 77 virus invasion is thus worth investigating. 78 Arfs are small, ubiquitously expressed GTP-binding proteins best known for 79 their role in membrane trafficking (D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006; Beck et al., 80 2011; Popoff et al., 2011; Sannerud et al., 2011) and in regulating actin cytoskeleton 81 assembly (Myers and Casanova, 2008). The six mammalian Arfs are divided into 82 three classes based on their amino-acid identity. Class I contains Arf1, Arf2, and Arf3; 83 class II contains Arf4 and Arf5; and class III contains only Arf6. Class I and class II 84 Arfs are mainly concentrated in the Golgi apparatus, although they also function in 85 endosomal compartments. By contrast, Arf6 is primarily localized in the plasma 86 membrane and is a subset of the endosomes. A large body of evidence indicates that 87 Arfs promote the biogenesis of carrier vesicles by nucleating the assembly of coat 88 protein complexes in the sites of vesicle formation (Myers and Casanova, 2008; 89 localizations and functions, which depend on the specific membrane they bind 91 according to their recruitment of diverse groups of proteins. Such specificities can be 92 defined by determining which regulators of Arfs, GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange 93 factors), and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) function with which Arf proteins Donaldson and Honda, 2005; Sun et al., 2011). The binding of Arfs to membranes 95 appears to be essential for viral replication (Belov et al., 2007a), and they cycle 96 between GTP-and GDP-bound states. In the former cycle, the activated form 97 Arf-GTP is bound to the membrane; in the latter cycle, Arf-GDP is released by the 98 cellular GTPase activity into the cytoplasm. 99 During the evolutionary interplay between virus infection and host defense, the 100 Arf-dependent secretion pathway may be involved in anti-virus action through 101 secretion of interferons and presentation of viral antigens by MHC I (Molla et al., 102 1991; Ma et al., 2010). The pathway of secretion or endocytic can easily be made to 103 cause viral immune evasion and virus propagation, and Arfs can be recruited to the 104 specific target membrane to induce disintegration of intracellular membranes and 105 formation of specific vesicles by viral proteins mediating their interactors (Belov et al., 106 2007b). Arf1 was reported to have important roles in the regulation of viral RNA 107 replication and the production of infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV), a kind of 108 plus-strand RNA virus (Matto et al., 2011). GBF1, a kind of Arf GEFs, was crucial for 109 the RNA replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) (Lanke et al., 2009). In addition to 110 the function in the viral RNA replication, class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) played 111 important roles in the secretion of dengue virus (DENV) (Kudelko et al., 2012). 112 Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication was dependent on the 113 GBF1-mediated Arf1 activation (Verheije et al., 2008). The replication of plant RNA 114 virus also needed the participation of Arf1 (Hyodo et al., 2013). The previous research 115 showed that Arfs were related to RNA virus replication and secretion, however, the 116 relationship between Arfs and DNA virus infection was rarely reported. WSSV is 117 a double stranded DNA virus and MjArf4 from M. japonicus was significantly 118 up-regulated with the propagation of WSSV (Zhang et al., 2010). The relatively low 119 expression level of MjArfn in WSSV-resistant shrimp may suggest its roles in WSSV invasion (Ma et al.et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2012), Arfs were rarely studied. In this 123 study, two Arf genes (MrArf1 and MrArf2) were identified from M. rosenbergii, an 124 economically important crustacean in the aquaculture industry (Mohanakumaran Nair 125 et al., 2006) for the first time. The expression level of MrArfs were up-regulated with 126 the WSSV propagation, which might preliminary indicate the roles of MrArfs , tissue collection and Immune challenge by WSSV 131 M. rosenbergii (about 15 g each) were purchased from an aquaculture market in 132 Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The prawns were acclimatized in freshwater 133 tanks under laboratory conditions at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). The prawns were 134 divided into a control group and an experimental group designated as 135 WSSV-challenged group. The WSSV inoculum was prepared following the previous 136 paper (Wu et al., 2008). In brief, it was extracted from virus-infected M. japonicus by 137 homogenizing muscle in TN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 400 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Then 138 the tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatant was 139 diluted 100 times with 0.9% NaCl and was subsequently filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m 140 filter. About 100 \u00b5L of filtrate (10 5 WSSV copies/mL) was injected into the lateral 141 area of the fourth abdominal segment of the prawns using a syringe with 29-gauge 142 needle. The hepatopancreas and gills of the prawns challenged with WSSV at 0, 24, 143 and 48 h (3 prawns at each time) were collected for RNA extraction.",

These primer 230 sets were used to amplify the corresponding PCR products as templates for dsRNA 231 synthesis. The dsRNA was synthesized using T7 polymerase (Fermentas, USA) 232 following the previous method (Wang et al., 2009). 233 The Giant Freshwater Prawn was randomly divided into four groups. All Giant 234 Freshwater Prawn in this assay were kept in tanks at about 22\u00b0C. The first group was 235 injected with 80 \u00b5g of dsMrArf1 RNA. The second group was injected with 80 \u00b5g of 236 dsMrArf2 RNA. The third group was injected with 80 \u00b5g of dsGFP RNA. The 237 untreated fourth group was used as control. Finally, all four groups were injected with 238 WSSV (1 \u00d7 10 5 virions) at 48 h after dsRNA were injected. Total RNA were extracted from gills at 36 h after the WSSV injection. qRT-PCR analysis was used to detect the 240 efficiency of the RNAi and WSSV levels. The primers of MrArf1 and MrArf2 were 241 the same as part 2.5. Vp28 gene expression was detected using primers Cloning of full-length cDNA of MrArf1 and MrArf2 250 Ran, Rab, and Rho proteins, members of small GTPases found in crustaceans are 251 involved in innate defense response (He et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2007; 252 Liu et al., 2009;). Arfs in mammalian cells participate in virus assembly, replication, 253 and release (Belov et al., 2007a). Some of the Arfs of the shrimp M. japonicus are 254 engaged in virus-host interaction events (Wang et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2010; Zhang et 255 al., 2010). These findings suggest that investigating whether or not Arf GTPases in the 256 giant freshwater prawn M. rosenbergii are involved in innate immunity against of the transcriptome of the hepatopancreas and intestine of the 259 freshwater prawns using the Solexa methods resulted in two different EST sequences 260 similar to the Arf gene, which were designated as MrArf1 and MrArf2. The full-length 261 cDNA of MrArf1 was 1819 bp, including a 132-bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 262 549-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 182 amino acid proteins and a 1138-bp 3' 263 UTR. MrArf2 was 1364 bp in length with a 537-bp ORF encoding a protein with 178 264 amino acids. The 5' and 3' UTR of MrArf2 were 141 and 686 bp, respectively. The 265 molecular weights of MrArf1 and MrArf2 were 20.7 and 19.9 kDa, respectively, and 266 their pI values were 6.15 and 5.93, respectively. Each of them had an ARF domain 267 (Supplement 1A, 1B). BLAST P analysis showed that MrArf1 was 100% identical 268 with the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 from M. japonicus (MjArf1). However, the coding region cDNA sequence of MrArf1 was only 86% identical with that of MjArf1. MrArf1 and MjArf1 were 64.3% identical to each other. In contrast to that of 271 MjArf1, the 3' UTR of MrArf1 had many extra insertions of nucleotides. Blast P 272 analysis showed that MrArf2 shared 60% identity with MjArfn. The coding region of 273 MrArf2 was 64% identical with that of MjArfn. 274 275 3.2. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of MrArf1 and MrArf2 with other 276 Arfs 277 The multiple alignment of the MrArf1 with other Arf1s showed that the Arf1 278 proteins were highly conserved and had an N-terminal myristoylation site of G. The 279 protein sequences of P loop (GLDAAGK), switch regions (GEIVT/showed that the Arf proteins from different species could 287 be divided into 4 different classes. Class I consists of Arf1, Arf2 and Arf3. MrArf1 288 from giant freshwater prawns and MjArf1 from shrimp M. japonicus belong to class I. 289 Class II contains Arf4 and Arf5. MjArf4 and insect Arfs belong to class II. Arf6 290 proteins constitute class III. MrArf2 is not clustered into these 3 classes and MrArf2 291 and MjArfn belong to a unique class (Supplement 3).292",

The 314 results displayed a distinguished up-regulation of MrArf1 and MrArf2 post WSSV 315 challenge, demonstrating that MrArf1 and MrArf2 can significantly be triggered by 316 WSSV infection. Specific evidence was also presented to verify our hypothesis that 317 MrArf1 and MrArf2 have a pivotal function in WSSV-related prawn innate immunity. 318 However, MrArf1 and MrArf2 transcription patterns were distinct from those of Arf1, 319 Arf4, and Arfn in the hepatopancreas of M. japonicus, which were up-regulated and 320 quickly reached the highest level only 6 h after infection. In our study, MrArf1 321 reached the maximal level 48 h after infection (Fig. 1A, 1C). The MrArf2 transcript in 322 the gills was significantly down-regulated at first 24 h after infection (Fig. 1B) but 323 up-regulated and reached the highest value at 48 h. In hepatopancreas, the MrArf2 was 324 significantly up-regulated at 24 h after infection (Fig. 1D). These findings are 325 consistent with the transcriptional tendency of Mjcent, the Arf6 GAP of M. japonicus 326(Wang et al., 2009).
