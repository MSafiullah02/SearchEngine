Although uncertainties predominate the epidemiology of this new virus,1 several observations are relevant for policy making at this stage of the pandemic:Asymptomatic transmission. Increasing evidence suggests that the time from infection to infectiousness (the latency period) is less than the time to symptoms (the incubation period). Thus, people may inadvertently infect others before realizing they are infected because they are not yet experiencing symptoms. Asymptotic cases may be particularly common in children and young adults.Disease severity and risk of death. The crude case fatality ratio is estimated to be significantly higher than that for seasonal influenza,3 and it is dramatically higher in the aged and those with underlying comorbid conditions (especially cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and diabetes) regardless of age.3 Persons in at-risk strata form a significant fraction of the world population.Lack of options for control. No vaccine or effective antiviral drug is likely to be widely available for months or longer.4\nCombined with lack of widespread diagnostic testing, these factors have produced one crucial implication for public health: Without intervention, people in the high-risk strata will be exposed by those around them who do not realize they are infectious. This situation is particularly acute with intergenerational mixing among the asymptomatic, in which infectious youths might intermingle with the high-risk elderly.",
