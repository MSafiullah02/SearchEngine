Secretion retention in airways may cause obstruction of broncopulmonary units and atelectasis, and this is even more pronounced in smokers and in patients with chronic lung disease. The diagnosis of sputum retention can be clinical and it is characterized by FEV1 forced expiratory volume in one second, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respiratory distress with rapid, shallow, and bubbly breaths. There was a strong association between sputum retention and postoperative pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking history, and poor analgesia [10] . There is a great importance for physiotherapy in this situation. At least two daily visits should be performed; some patients need more. Another noteworthy point is the hydration of patients for secretion mobilization. Oxygen therapy via a facemask inevitably dries secretions when non-humidified oxygen is used. This causes mucociliary dysfunction and a decreased ability to clear secretions, so humidified oxygen should be used. Sometimes mucolytic agents can be helpful. Chest physiotherapy is a therapeutic modality that should be kept in mind. Postural drainage, percussion, and vibration are applied to the affected lung opening and promote coughing during which physicians should provide adequate analgesia. Despite these interventions, tracheal suctioning can be used in patients who cannot remove secretions. Before suctioning, high oxygen fraction should be used in patients at risk for hypoxemia.",

Patients with COPD may have ineffective cough, increased secretions, and impaired gas exchange after lung resections, especially hypercapnia secondary to hypoventilation. Some patients may need reintubation and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary rehabilitation includes breathing exercise, cough training, and self-management education; psychosocial support has been shown to decrease complications [12, 13] . Preoperative assessment of these patients for targeting reduces postoperative complications and improves survival. Pneumonia is the most significant postoperative complication that increases morbidity and mortality. These interventions may help reduce the incidence, severity, and risks of pneumonia.

Surgical incision, intercostal nerve injury, and inflammation are major causes of pain after thoracic surgery. Thoracic epidural analgesia is still considered the gold standard for pain relief after thoracotomies, but recently some evidence showed that a paravertebral block had a similar analgesic effect with fewer adverse effects than thoracic epidural analgesia [18] . For reduced complications after thoracic surgery, patients should be able to breathe deeply, cough, and remove secretions and should be mobilized early. Postoperative ineffective pain relief associates with worsened pulmonary complications. Belda reported that a higher postoperative pain score was an independent predictor of postoperative respiratory infections [19] . Recently, multimodal analgesia has been preferred for post thoracotomy pain. In this regimen, regional blocks are combined with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, selective cyclooxygenase \u22122 inhibitors, and \u03b12 agonists. Multimodal analgesia is more effective and has fewer adverse effects. When the age and comorbid conditions of these patients are considered, more attention must be paid to the drugs used for analgesia in this population.",

The rate of bacterial colonization was significantly higher in patients with lung cancer (51.9 %) than in those with nonmalignant lung disease (37.3 %) and healthy volunteers (37.8 %), and the Gram-negative colonization was higher in this cancer group than in other patient populations.

The change in the pattern suggests that the colonization of microorganisms in the early postoperative period may be caused by the aspiration of gastric contents and frequent interventions to the airway in the operating room and ICU. In contrast to these studies, some authors reported a good correlation between microorganisms isolated from patients who developed postoperative pneumonia with the same agents identified preoperatively [1, 19, 21, 30] .

In addition to these criteria, dyspnea, worsening oxygenation, and changes in the amount or character of sputum support the diagnosis of pneumonia. Radiologic signs of pneumonia may be difficult to differentiate pneumonia from pulmonary embolism or atelectasis, especially in the immediate postoperative period. Chest X-rays are taken in the ICU with portable machines, which also add difficulty resulting in suboptimal quality images. The evaluation of chest X-rays is more difficult in patients who undergo lung surgery, and for these reasons, chest X-rays are only used to support the diagnosis; therefore thorax CT may be useful for definitive diagnosis in this situation (Figs. 14.2 and 14.3) .",

If ETA samples are quantitatively analyzed, the accuracy of the results is close to bronchoscopic results. Differential diagnosis in this period is quite difficult. Sputum samples should be obtained if patients can cough effectively. For patients being treated in the ICU and being mechanically ventilated, fiberoptic bronchoscopy is very convenient. Bronchoscopic sampling should especially be performed in patients who fail to respond to antibiotic treatment. Bronchoscopic sampling is appropriate for rare microorganisms such as viral, fungal, and atypical etiologic agents in patients who had induction therapy before surgery. Microorganisms isolated from airways during the perioperative period may help to initiate empiric antibiotic treatment. ",
