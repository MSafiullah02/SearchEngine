This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of metal ions, graphene (Gr), and graphene oxide (GO), individually and in combination, against the planktonic and biofilm states of two antimicrobially resistant clinical strains of P. aeruginosa each with different antibiotic resistance profiles. Minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and fractional inhibitory concentrations were performed to determine the efficacy of the metal ions and graphene composites individually and their synergy in combination. Crystal violet biofilm and XTT assays measured the biofilm inhibition and metabolic activity, respectively. Molybdenum, platinum, tin, gold, and palladium ions exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity (MIC = 7.8-26.0 mg/L), whilst GO and Gr demonstrated moderate-to-no effect against the planktonic bacterial cells, irrespective of their antibiograms. Biofilms were inhibited by zinc, palladium, silver, and graphene. In combination, silver-graphene and molybdenum-graphene inhibited both the planktonic and biofilm forms of the bacteria making them potential candidates for development into topical antimicrobials for burns patients infected with antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "The burden of antimicrobial resistance is a daily challenge in clinical settings, especially in acute and intensive care units. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most clinically important antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (AMR-GNB), being a common cause of urinary tract and lower respiratory tract infections, i.e., ventilator-associated pneumonia (Rupp\u00e9 et al. 2015) . It is also commonly found in burn infections (Coetzee et al. 2013) . P. aeruginosa maintains chronic infection through the formation of biofilms, which causes a delay in burn wound healing, patient recovery, and it is also a causative agent of graft loss. (Coetzee et al. 2013; Gonzalez et al. 2016 ). Treating MDR Pseudomonas species infections is challenging, and alternatives to systemic administered antibiotics are needed. Silver impregnated dressings and topical chemotherapeutics, such as mafenide acetate 11.2% cream, are being clinically used in the treatment of superficial and deep burn wounds, with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) remaining the standard topical antimicrobial for burn infections (Adhya et al. 2015) . However, following the excessive and uncontrolled use of silver in medical and non-medical applications, serious concerns have been raised regarding bacterial resistance to silver (Chopra 2007) , and thus, there is a need to look for other silver combinations and metal mixtures that have the potential to be used as antimicrobials. Communicated by Erko Stackebrandt. For the last decade, carbon nanostructures (CNS) have gained a significant attention due to their physical and chemical properties, being used in biosensors and coating biomaterials for tissue transplantation (Al-Jumaili et al. 2017) . Several studies have shown that graphene-based materials exhibit antimicrobial activities (Dizaj et al. 2015; Ji et al. 2016; Slate et al. 2018) . Graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide have been previously demonstrated to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa (Hu et al. 2010; Gurunathan et al. 2012; Tu et al. 2013; Hussein-Al-Ali et al. 2014) . However, the activity of graphene against P. aeruginosa when combined with metal ions is still not well documented.",

After washing the biofilms three times with PBS, the XTT-menadione solution (750 \u00b5L) were added to each well and incubated in the dark at 37 \u00b0C. After 3 h, the OD of the supernatant was read at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer.

The degree of antimicrobial efficacy towards a specific pathogen may be affected by the surrounding milieu or the bacteria itself, or the specific chemical properties of the metal ions, for example, their reduction potential and speciation. Thus, it may be prudent to use different metal ions tailored to a specific bacteria and environment. Overall, the same values for the MIC and MBC for the metals, graphene, and graphene oxide were recorded for the two distinct isolates of P. aeruginosa despite having different antibiotic profiles. The only exceptions were niobium and rhodium that displayed different MICs and MBCs against the two strains.

Several studies have indicated that graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa with at least an 86-99.9% reduction in viability (Hu et al. 2010; Tu et al. 2013 ). However, this was inconsistent with our results where graphene showed only a moderate effect (MIC = 125 mg/L) and graphene oxide (MIC > 500 mg/L) showed no inhibitory effect against any of the isolates tested. On the other hand, Ruiz et al. have previously demonstrated that graphene oxide enhanced bacterial growth (Ruiz et al. 2011 ). However, the bactericidal effect of graphene-based composites remains poorly understood. This requires further investigation, especially since their effect on the structure and viability of bacterial cells has also been shown to be dependent on the sample preparation and concentration, time of exposure, and physico-chemical properties, as well as on the method of microbiological analysis (Akhavan and Ghaderi, 2010; Hu et al. 2010) . It may be speculated that in this study, the negative antimicrobial results obtained with graphene oxide against the planktonic bacterial form may be due to the type of graphene oxide used. It has been demonstrated that highly purified graphene oxide was inert against planktonic forms of bacterial cells (Barbolina et al. 2016) . Furthermore, Barbolina et al. (2016) , assigned the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of graphene oxide found in previous studies to the contaminants (sulphur, nitrogen) that remained following the preparation of the graphene oxide rather than to the effects of the graphene oxide itself (Barbolina et al. 2016 ).",

This may indicate that the metals/graphene combinations resulted in complementary modes of action, which enhanced the total antimicrobial efficacy, although this needs further investigation. A possible hypothesis might be that the metal ions, being in solution, become evenly dispersed in the environment surrounding the pathogen with no specific laterality (McQuillan et al. 2012) . Meanwhile, adsorption of graphene particles by the pathogen may induce cell wall depolarization making the bacterial cell more permeable to destruction, assisting the metal ions to enter inside the bacterial cell (Pal et al. 2007) .",

While silver alone and graphene alone exhibited no effect against the planktonic forms of the isolates, when the silver-graphene combination was tested, it reduced both the number of planktonic cells and the amount of biofilm formed. Graphene oxide showed reduced growth of the biofilms when combined to molybdenum, gold, platinum, or gallium. The assessment of the cell viability of the biofilms of both isolates post-treatment with silver, silver-graphene, gold-graphene oxide, and molybdenum-graphene oxide showed a significant reduction in biomass.",

Furthermore, the resulting combinations (silver-graphene, molybdenum-graphene/graphene oxide, gold/graphene/graphene oxide, platinum/graphene/graphene oxide, and gallium/graphene/graphene oxide) were able to significantly reduce the biofilm formation of the AMR isolates. Overall, the silver-graphene and molybdenum-graphene showed an antimicrobial effect against both planktonic and biofilm forms of the bacteria irrespective of their antibiotic resistance profiles. In light to the increasing resistance to the currently used antibiotics, this study suggests that metal ions and graphene derivatives present a potential biocidal alternative for the control of AMR P. aeruginosa infections for potential use in burn wounds.",
