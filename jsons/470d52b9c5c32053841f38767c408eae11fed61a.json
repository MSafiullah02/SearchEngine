            "text": "Clustering traditionally consists in partitioning data into subsets of similar instances with no prior knowledge on the clusters to be obtained. However, clustering is an ill-defined problem in the sense that the data partitions output by clustering algorithms have no guarantee to satisfy end users' needs. Indeed, different users may be interested in different views underlying the data [25] . For example, considering either the topics or the writing style in a collection of documents leads to different clustering results. In this study, we consider a setting where clustering is guided through user-defined constraints, which is known as constrained clustering [2] . Enabling users to provide clustering constraints in the context of an exploratory task can help obtain results better tailored to their needs. Typically, must-link and cannot-link constraints are considered (e.g., see [27, 29] ), which state whether two data instances should be (respectively, should not be) in the same cluster. However, important manual annotation efforts may still be required to provide such constraints in sufficient number. In the specific case of document clustering, constraints can otherwise be provided in the form of seed words: each cluster that the user wishes to obtain is described by a small set of words (e.g., 3 words) which characterize the cluster. For example, a user who wants to explore a collection of news articles might provide the set of seed words {'sport', 'competition', 'champion'}, {'finance', 'market', 'stock'}, {'technology', 'innovation', 'science'} to guide the discovery of three clusters on sport, finance, and technology, respectively. Recent studies which include seed word constraints for document clustering are mostly focused on topic modeling approaches [8, 16, 17, 19] , inspired by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model [3] . Concurrently, important advances on clustering were recently enabled through its combination with deep representation learning (e.g., see [12, 23, 30, 31] ), which is now known as deep clustering. A common approach to deep clustering is to jointly train an autoencoder and perform clustering on the learned representations [23, 30, 31] . One advantage of deep clustering approaches lies in their ability to leverage semantic representations based on word embeddings, enabling related documents to be close in the embedding space even when they use different (but related) words.",

            "text": "The constrained clustering problem we are addressing in fact bears strong similarity with the one of seed-guided dataless text classification, which consist in categorizing documents based on a small set of seed words describing the classes/clusters. For a more general survey on constrained clustering, we invite the reader to refer to [2] . The task of dataless text classification was introduced independently by Liu et al. [20] and Ko et al. [14] . In [20] , the seed words are provided by a user and exploited to automatically label a part of the unlabeled documents. On the other hand, in [14] , seed words initially correspond to labels/titles for the classes of interest and are extended based on co-occurrence patterns. In both cases, a Naive Bayes classifier is applied to estimate the documents' class assignments. In the wake of these seminal works, several studies further investigated the exploitation of seed words for text classification [6, 9, 10] . Chang et al. [6] introduced both an 'on-the-fly' approach and a bootstrapping approach by projecting seed words and documents in the same space. The former approach simply consists in assigning each document to the nearest class in the space, whereas the latter learns a bootstrapping Naive Bayes classifier with the class-informed seed words as initial training set. Another bootstrapping approach is studied in [10] , where two different methods are considered to build the initial training set from the seed words: Latent Semantic Indexing and Gaussian Mixture Models. The maximum entropy classifier proposed in [9] instead directly uses seed words' class information by assuming that documents containing seed words from a class are more likely to belong to this class.",

            "text": "More recently, the dataless text classification problem was addressed through topic modeling approaches [8, 16, 17, 19] , extending the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model [3] . The topic model devised by Chen et al. [8] integrates the seed words as pseudo-documents, where each pseudo-document contains all the seed words given for a single class. The co-occurrence mechanism underlying topic models along with the known class membership of pseudo-documents help guide the actual documents to be classified towards their correct class. In [17] , the Seed-guided Topic Model (STM) distinguishes between two types of topics: category topics and general topics. The former describe the class information and are associated with an informed prior based on the seed words, whereas the latter correspond to the general topics underlying the whole collection. The category topics assigned to a document are then used to estimate its class assignment. STM was extended in [16] to simultaneously perform classification and document filtering -which consists in identifying the documents related to a given set of categories while discarding irrelevant documents -by further dividing category topics into relevant and non-relevant topics. Similarly to STM, the Laplacian Seed Word Topic Model (LapSWTM) introduced by Li et al. [19] considers both category topics and general topics. It however differs from previous models in that it enforces a document manifold regularization to overcome the issue of documents containing no seed words. If these models outperform previously proposed models, they suffer from a lack of flexibility on the input representations they rely on. Indeed, topic models require documents to be organized as sets of discrete units -the word tokens. This prohibits the use of representation learning techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., word2vec [22] and GloVe [26] ).",

This can be done aggressively, by retaining, in the masked version, only the words that correspond to seed words and by computing an average of their word embeddings, or smoothly by reweighing all words in the original document according to their proximity with seed words.

However, firstly, LapSWTM counts 8 hyperparameters that were empirically optimized in the original paper, and it is not straightforward how these hyperparameters should be tuned on the additional datasets used here. Secondly, LapSWTM shares a lot with the STM model in its construction and performance. Thirdly, the code for LapSWTM is, as far as we are aware, not publicly available. For these different reasons, we simply chose STM to represent the state of the art in topic modeling-based dataless text classification. Based on this score, one can then select the top words for each class as seed words. We emphasize that such heuristics is only adopted for the purpose of simulating seed words during the evaluation: it is not destined to be used to identify seed words in a real-world application, where ground truth is unknown.",

Neural networks' weights are initialized based on the Xavier scheme [11] . The SD2C, DKM, and AE-KM models are trained with the Adam optimizer [13] with standard hyperparameters (\u03b7 = 0.001, \u03b2 1 = 0.9, and \u03b2 2 = 0.999) and minibatches of 256 documents. The number of epochs for the auto-encoder pretraining and model finetuning are fixed to 50 and 200, respectively, as in [23] . We also use the inverse temperature \u03b1 = 1000 from [23] for the parameterized softmax-based differentiable reformulations of SD2C models. The balancing hyperparameters \u03bb 0 and \u03bb 1 of SD2C-Doc and SD2C-Rep were both set to 10 \u22125 . We experimented with different word embedding techniques including word2vec [22] , doc2vec [15] , and FastText [4] trained either on an external large corpus (e.g., Google News) or individually on the datasets used in the experiments. We found that training the word embedding models on the experiments' collections consistently improved in terms of clustering performance on external corpus-based training. Among the word embedding techniques we tested, word2vec and FastText performed evenly and significantly better than doc2vec. Since word2vec is faster to train than FastText, which operates at the character level, we chose the former technique (in practice, Gensim 9 word2vec Python implementation) trained on each of our experiments' datasets to compute the word embeddings. The word embedding size was fixed to 100. The Skip-Gram model was trained with a window size of 50 words on 20NEWS and 10 words on other datasets.

The runtime of the SD2C approaches is lower than that of STM on most datasets. STM was only faster on AGNEWS (between 2 and 3 times), yet far slower on 20NEWS (about 10 times). This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that STM's complexity is dominated by the total number of tokens (large for a small number of documents in 20NEWS), whereas SD2C models only depend on the number of documents (large with few tokens per document in AGNEWS). As to the SD2C models, SD2C-Rep runs faster than SD2C-Doc. This is due to the complexity of the constraint-enforcing loss term being lower for the former than for the latter. ",

For comprehensiveness, we study the clustering results of the SD2C models when the number of (automatically selected) seed words per cluster is varied from 1 to 5. The evolution of the performance for the SD2C models in terms of accuracy is illustrated in Fig. 2 . We observe that using more seed words leads to notable improvements in most cases -with the exception of SD2C-Doc-e, which seems to be less influenced by the number of seed words. This trend is particularly apparent when the number of seed words is increased from 1 to 2. Although slight performance gain is observed between 2 and 5 seed words, the results exhibit greater stability. This suggests that providing as few as 2 seed words per cluster -which constitutes a modest annotation effort for humans -can prove highly beneficial for the clustering results obtained by our SD2C approaches.",

The corresponding list of seed words contain in average 5.1 words per category for 20NEWS and 6.8 words per category for REUTERS. The procedure to constitute these lists of descriptive seed words is detailed in [8] . Table 4 summarizes the results obtained with such seed words. These results first show that the scores obtained by the different methods using the manual seed words are close to the ones obtained with the automatically selected ones. For example, the difference in ACC for STM amounts to only 0.7 points on 20NEWS and 0.2 points on REUTERS. This shows that the automatic selected seed words are a reasonable substitute to manual seed words for evaluation purposes. In addition, SD2C methods still significantly outperform STM on 20NEWS. SD2C-Rep-c is here significantly better, even though the difference is not important, than STM on REUTERS -this is in line with our comment on Table 2 on the small differences between STM and SD2C on REUTERS.",

To do so, we have integrated constraints associated to seed words in the Deep k-Means optimization problem [23] , modifying either the document embeddings, the cluster representatives or the input representations to make them closer to the seed words retained. The new methods thus derived have been evaluated on five text collections widely used for text classification purposes. For this evaluation, we have proposed a simple method to automatically select seed words that behaves comparably to manual seed words for evaluation purposes. Several perspectives for this work can be envisaged. First of all, it is possible to extend the current framework with a 'garbage' cluster to collect documents that do not fit well within the clusters defined by the seed words. This can be useful in particular for document filtering [16] . Other types of autoencoders and other attention mechanisms can also be designed to try and improve the results of the SD2C methods. Combinations of the different approaches can also be studied so as to benefit from their respective strengths. Lastly, if the SD2C-Docc method overall outperforms the other approaches in terms of accuracy and adjusted rand index, we want to better understand when it is beneficial to bias the document representations and when to bias the cluster representative ones.",
