This study is important and interesting; however, there are still some concerns about it. 2 First, selection bias cannot be entirely excluded, although it is likely to be minimal as all COVID-19 patients (severe group and non-serve group) during the study period were included and matched for age, sex, body mass index, illness severity, some biochemistry indicators and the admission time point.",

Severe cases were more likely to have hepatitis B infection (2.4% vs 0.6%) than non-severe cases. 6 SARS patients with HBV/HCV infection were more prone to develop severe hepatitis, probably due to enhanced viral replication during SARS-CoV infection to liver injury in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill. 7 These data suggest more intensive immunotherapy may be required to minimize COVID-19, an issue that warrants further study. However, in patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear. Given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in cholangiocytes, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 aggravates cholestasis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, also needs to be studied in this study.",
