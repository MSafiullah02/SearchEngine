Whereas ARDS is often complicated by nosocomial pneumonia, pulmonary infection is also the most frequent single cause of ARDS. The prevalence of pneumonia during the course of ARDS seems to be particularly high, but whether persons with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of methodological limitations. Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS. To date, sepsis seems to be the principal link between pneumonia and ARDS. However, prospective observational data on this supposed sequence are not available. The individual role of specific pathogens for the development of ARDS is difficult to assess, because prospective studies are missing. Respiratory viruses have received particular attention, but this review suggests that infections with coronavirus and avian influenza virus (H5N1) are associated with a high incidence of ARDS.",

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is firmly diagnosed by clinical and radiographic criteria, but the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) imposes considerable difficulties, even when adequate lower respiratory tract samples are collected (table 1) . This is especially true when ARDS and pneumonia have to be differentiated in clinical practice [3] . The pathophysiology of pulmonary infiltrates in pneumonia is well defined, but the mechanisms behind the development of ARDS are still not fully understood. The hallmark of ARDS is the increased permeability of the edema, which is interpreted as being an accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveoli and is mediated by inflammation of various mechanisms [4] .",

Thus, it is virtually impossible to differentiate acute severe bilateral pneumonia from ARDS on clinical grounds alone. Accordingly, in a recent study of the association of ARDS with pneumonia by a comparison of clinical diagnoses based on the American-European Consensus Conference Criteria [1] and histopathologic evidence for diffuse alveolar damage [5, 3] , pneumonia was the most frequent mimic of ARDS. In the 43 patients who met ARDS criteria but who did not have diffuse alveolar damage, pneumonia was the most prevalent finding (32 [74%] of 43 patients) [3] . Pneumonia is also the most frequent lung condition leading to ARDS. In a series of 153 patients, Sloane et al. [6] reported pneumonia as the underlying etiology in 31% of all patients who developed ARDS, and virtually all patients with ARDS require mechanical ventilation, a major risk factor for the development of VAP [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "The sequence from bacterial pneumonia to ARDS can be followed more accurately in persons with CAP [11] . Estenssoro et al. [12] observed 3050 patients admitted to intensive care units during a 15-month study period; 1193 patients (39%) were mechanically ventilated, and 235 met the criteria for ARDS (7.7% of the total number of patients, and 19.7% of the ventilated patients). The predominant etiology of ARDS was sepsis (44%), and pneumonia was the most frequent single entity (65 cases). The authors did not differentiate between CAP and nosocomial pneumonia, and they have not followed-up with patients with pneumonia who have not developed ARDS to identify risk factors. The figures given by this group were comparable with those of previous studies that used similar ARDS criteria [13] [14] [15] [16] , with pneumonia remaining the most frequent single cause of sepsis. However, to draw meaningful conclusions, we need larger, prospective cohort studies that observe patients with CAP for progression to ARDS. To further identify the reasons why severe CAP progresses to ARDS, it is important to first discover why severe CAP progresses to sepsis. In a prospective cohort study [17] , 280 patients with CAP were included, and 31 subjects (11%) were identified who met the criteria for septic shock. In a multivariate analysis incorporating age; sex; the presence of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, or neurologic disease; alcohol consumption; prior antibiotic exposure; delayed antibiotic therapy; and TNF-a genotype, the only factors that remained significant predictors of septic shock were LTa+250 genotype and increasing age. The study design was repeated with a focus on the possible role of the intracellular adhesion molecule type 1 but failed to yield a significant association between CAP and sepsis [18] . Ten (4%) of the 289 patients in the cohort had ARDS, but it was not noted whether sepsis or septic shock preceded ARDS. These data, however, did not directly address the issue of whether sepsis is the required link between ARDS and pneumonia. Thus, risk factors for both development of severe sepsis and ARDS in the course of CAP remain undefined.",

In mechanically ventilated patients with VAP, the detection of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type 1 was a much more accurate diagnostic tool than any clinical finding. It was the strongest independent factor, predicting pneumonia (OR, 41.5) according to a logistic regression analysis with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 90%. The control group included a large number of patients with ARDS (31 [48%] of 64 patients), and the differential power of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells should be tested under this specific hypothesis. However, because soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells has been shown to be elevated in newly admitted, critically ill patients with suspected sepsis, this will exclude a large patient group with extrapulmonary pathogenesis of ARDS caused by sepsis [31] .",

The overall mortality was 31% (21 of 67 patients), and 21 (64%) of 33 patients developed ARDS. Peiris et al. [52] found lower figures; 15 (20%) of 75 patients progressed to ARDS during the 3-week follow-up period. They also identified age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamuvidine as being significant risk factors, but did not mention LDH. The mortality reported in this study was sur-prisingly low (5 [ 5%] of 75 patients); after subtracting the 2 patients who died from myocardial infarction, only 2 (15%) of 13 patients died from sepsis and ARDS [52] . Reports from several other series have suggested that a substantial number of patients develop respiratory failure and ARDS, with 17%-30% of patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit [53, 54] and a 21-day mortality of 3.6% [55] .",

Pneumonia is the most frequent complication of varicella infections in healthy adults [56, 57] and the leading cause of death among vaccine-preventable diseases [58] . The case reports describe young males with bilateral infiltrates with a rapid progression to ARDS [59] [60] [61] [62] . The anti-infective treatment invariably contains acyclovir, and in some cases, the treatment contains corticosteroid and/or immunoglobulins. One review found that 6 of 15 patients had life-threatening varicella pneumonia treated with corticosteroids [63] . These patients had significantly shorter hospital and intensive care unit stays (10 and 8 days, respectively), and no patient died. A newer case series of 14 patients with severe varicella pneumonia established the diagnosis of ARDS in 3 of 14 patients, and 1 patient died. All but 1 patient in this series had previous contact with a varicella-infected patient and no varicella infection during childhood [64] . Varicella infections go along with the characteristic rash; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are almost always established immediately, and bilateral infiltrates seem to be common.",

It has to be considered regularly in acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and a list of pathogens can be derived from the literature [66, 67] . Malaria due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum is, however, noted remarkably often in the literature as being associated with ARDS. Losert et al. [68] reviewed 104 patients admitted to the hospital with malaria, of whom 66% had P. falciparum infections, and 7 of these were admitted to the intensive care unit. Four patients underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation and developed ARDS, and 3 patients died. In another study [69] , only intensive care unit patients were considered, and 8 (20%) of 40 developed ARDS, with a mortality of 50%. Complications of malaria, such as coma, sepsis, or shock, were more prevalent among the group of patients with acute lung injury in this study and in the retrospective report by Bruneel et al. [70] . Therefore, we would like to support the hypothesis that ARDS is associated with the multiorgan failure that complicates the course of severe infection with P. falciparum, but the mechanisms seem to be independent from the causative agent [69, 70] .",

The prevalence of pneumonia during the course of ARDS seems to be particularly high, but whether patients with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of limitations in the methodology of the diagnosis of VAP and ARDS. Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS. Accordingly, the individual role of specific pathogens in the development of ARDS is difficult to assess. Most recently, new respiratory viruses have received particular attention, and this review suggests that infections with coronavirus and avian influenza virus are associated with an exceptionally high incidence of lung injury and ARDS.",
