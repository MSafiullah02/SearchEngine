Gern, MD a,b Viral infections and allergen exposure are 2 of the most common causes of acute wheezing and exacerbations of asthma in both children and adults. Clinical research findings indicate that there are synergistic interactions between allergy and viral infection that cause increased severity of asthma exacerbations. This article summarizes the current literature linking these 2 risk factors for asthma exacerbation, and reviews experimental data suggesting potential mechanisms for interactions between viral infection and allergy that cause asthma exacerbations. Finally, the authors discuss clinical evidence that treatment of allergic inflammation could help to reduce the frequency and severity of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.",

This incidence increases to 40% of children by age 3 and almost half of all children by age 6 years. 1 Two major pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), cause most of these illnesses. RSV is the major pathogen associated with wheezing illnesses in children younger than 2 years. [2] [3] [4] Of other viruses causing wheezing illnesses in infancy, HRV is next most common, and a variety of viruses (coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, bocavirus) also cause significant numbers of illnesses.",

The etiology of virus-induced wheezing illnesses varies with the season: RSV, metapneumoviruses, and influenza viruses (with the notable exception of 2009 H1N1) are usually limited to the winter and early spring. HRV infections are most common in the spring and fall, but can occur throughout the year. Of note, asthma exacerbations are also quite seasonal, and seasonal peaks in children occur regularly in the fall and spring. In Canada, the peaks in pediatric asthma exacerbations occur approximately 17 days after Labor Day every year, and it is assumed that viral infections that are spread within schools are a major contributor to the fall peaks, and perhaps also in the spring after the children return from spring break. 6, 7 It is important to bear in mind that other environmental exposures, including allergens and pollutants, also vary by season, and it seems likely that a combination of environmental factors contributes to the seasonal peaks in exacerbation rates.",

In the multivariate analysis, the viral illness and allergic sensitization/exposure were no longer significant, but the combination of these risk factors dramatically increased the risk of hospital admission (odds ratio 19.4, P<.001), demonstrating the link between these factors in causing asthma exacerbations. Similar findings were reported in an earlier case-control study involving adults; the combination of sensitization, high exposure to one or more indoor allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted to the hospital with asthma (odds ratio 8.4, 95% confidence interval 2.1-32.8; P 5 .002). 17 Finally, in the Inner City Asthma Study (ICAS), children who were sensitized and highly exposed to cockroach allergen were more likely to be admitted to hospital, have more unscheduled medical visits, and more time off school than either nonexposed or nonsensitized children. 18 Virology was not performed in ICAS, but it can be presumed that viral infections were important contributors to asthma morbidity in this population.",

Clinically defined illnesses were then classified according to temporal association with detection of a respiratory virus.

[19] [20] [21] These studies indicate that HRV infections have the potential to modify and interact with allergic airway inflammation in the lower airways. Accordingly, subjects with allergic rhinitis who were inoculated with HRV had increased levels of histamine in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples immediately and 48 hours after antigen challenge during HRV infection. 22 These same changes were not observed in nonallergic subjects infected with HRV and challenged to antigen, suggesting that the combination of viral infection and allergic disease leads to greater airway inflammation. In addition, experimentally induced HRV infection caused an enhanced eosinophilic response to allergen challenge in the allergic but not nonallergic subjects. This effect persisted for as long as 1 month after the acute HRV infection. Two additional studies determined whether the induction of allergic inflammation would increase the severity of HRV-induced respiratory symptoms. Contrary to expectations, allergen exposure before HRV inoculation led to either no change or a slight reduction in the severity and duration of cold symptoms. 23, 24 Of note is the difference in the sequence of administration of virus and allergen; this raises the question of which initiates the exacerbation, the virus or the allergic inflammation? Other factors to consider in thinking about the different outcomes of these studies are the nature of the allergen and pattern of exposure (dose and duration). It is possible that chronic low-dose allergen exposure before HRV infection amplifies the response to subsequent HRV inoculation.",

These studies have generally reported that the upper airway manifestations of HRV infections are similar in subjects with or without allergies or asthma, but that lower airway symptoms are increased in asthma. Two studies involving subjects with mild asthma have found similar cellular inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines in airway cells when compared with normal control subjects. 25, 26 In contrast, Message and colleagues 27 found several asthma-related differences in the response to experimental HRV infection. In asthmatic subjects, HRV infection enhanced eosinophilic inflammation. In addition, virologic and clinical outcomes were related to deficient interferon (IFN)-g and interleukin (IL)-10 responses and to augmented IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 responses from blood and airway mononuclear cells. In a study of similar design, DeMore and colleagues 25 found that numbers of airway eosinophils preinoculation were significantly related to cold scores induced by HRV infection. Collectively, these findings suggest that eosinophilic inflammation and T-helper 2 (Th2)-biased immune responses associated with allergic sensitization enhance the clinical severity of illness associated with HRV infection.",

Clinical studies 28, 29 and experimental evidence from animal models 30 suggest that either weak T-helper 1 (Th1) responses or Th2 bias can lead to more severe viral infections, and both of these abnormalities have also been implicated as a risk factor for allergies and asthma. [31] [32] [33] In addition, children with recurrent respiratory infections were reported to have low IFN-a responses. 34 Interferons have also been related to outcomes of HRV illnesses in studies of volunteers inoculated with a safety-tested strain of HRV-16. Virus-induced IFN-g responses in blood mononuclear cells were inversely associated with viral shedding after inoculation, 35 and stronger Th1-like responses in sputum cells (higher IFN-g/IL-5 mRNA ratio) during induced colds were associated with milder cold symptoms and more rapid clearance of the virus. 36 In addition to findings in the experimental inoculation model, there is evidence from clinical studies that asthma is associated with impaired virus-induced blood cell production of IFN-a and IFN-g. [37] [38] [39] Furthermore, some studies have reported that HRV-induced epithelial cell production of IFN-b and IFN-l is also impaired in asthma, suggesting that interferon responses in asthma are generally depressed. 40, 41 On the other hand, these findings were not replicated in 2 recent studies examining cytokine responses in cultured airway epithelial cells, 42, 43 and so far studies of experimentally inoculated volunteers with asthma have not found evidence of increased HRV shedding in either the upper or lower airways. Additional studies of naturally acquired colds in patients with asthma are needed to resolve these differences.",

This concept is further supported by a recent study of gene expression patterns from peripheral blood cells of children presenting for emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, mostly associated with viral respiratory infections. 47 Monocyte-dendritic cell populations had an up-regulated expression of FceRIa with a concomitant gene expression signature that is representative of the IL-4/IL-13-dependent \"alternatively activated\" phenotype. Together, these studies suggest an important link between early innate antiviral responses and the subsequent development of atopic diseases.

Furthermore, montelukast-induced reductions in EDN levels were associated with a significant decrease in wheezing episodes in followup. 60 Finally, omalizumab reduces the risk of exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma, 61 and provides an ideal tool to determine whether inhibiting allergic inflammation will reduce the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. Additional studies are needed to more fully explore the effects of asthma controllers on viral exacerbations.",
