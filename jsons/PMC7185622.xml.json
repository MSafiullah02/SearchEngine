Antithrombin inhibitory activity decreases markedly during severe sepsis, often to <50% of normal levels [31]. Because the rates of inhibition of the target proteases are strongly dependent on the antithrombin concentration, this decrease in inhibitor concentration would contribute to increased stability of the coagulation enzymes and hence favor intravascular coagulation.",

Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and endotoxin can downregulate thrombomodulin and the EPCR by inhibiting gene transcription 34, 35, reducing the ability to generate activated protein C. Neutrophil elastase cleaves thrombomodulin from the endothelial-cell surface, generating a much less active form of thrombomodulin [36]. In septic patients, both the EPCR and thrombomodulin can be severely downregulated, as demonstrated both immunohistochemically [37] and by analysis of the ability of the patients to generate activated protein C [38]. In addition, protein C levels decrease dramatically in patients with severe sepsis. This is probably due to a combination of consumption and liver (the main site of protein C synthesis) dysfunction. The degree of protein C reduction correlates with a negative prognosis in septic patients [39].",

Antithrombin can downregulate the expression of CD11b/CD18 on leukocytes. Because factor X binding to this receptor augments factor X activation 41, 42, the downregulation of this cellular factor X receptor decreases both leukocyte adhesion and coagulation. The addition of antithrombin to endothelial cells in culture increases prostacyclin formation [43] and decreases NF-\u03baB signaling [10]. By modulating cellular responses to endotoxin, antithrombin appears to decrease both tissue factor and IL-6 expression in monocytes and endothelium [40]. Antithrombin binding to syndecan 4, a proteoglycan on neutrophils, inhibits chemokine-induced neutrophil migration [44]. Interestingly, heparin blocks this effect. In addition, administration of high levels of antithrombin to septic experimental animals and animals undergoing ischemia reperfusion injury reverses leukocyte recruitment [45] (Figure 4\n).",

Thrombomodulin not only increases protein C activation but also prevents thrombin from activating protease-activated receptors (PARs) 46, 47. This is accomplished at least in part because the site on thrombin (anion binding exosite 1) responsible for binding PAR1 and thrombomodulin overlap (Figure 5\n). In addition, thrombin bound to thrombomodulin gains the ability to activate a plasma procarboxypeptidase R [also known as thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)] [48]. Recent studies have shown that his carboxypeptidase is a very potent inhibitor of the complement anaphylatoxin, C5a 49, 50, and bradykinin [50]. By inhibiting these vasoactive substances, the generation of this carboxypeptidase, especially in the microcirculation [51], probably helps to prevent severe drops in blood pressure and microvascular injury, and subsequent edema, in animals with severe acute inflammatory injuries.",

In addition, activated protein C can inhibit tight neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium [6]. Activated protein C can also decrease endothelial-cell apoptosis [9]. This function is dependent on the EPCR and apparently involves activation of PAR1 [58]. In mouse models of stroke, activated protein C minimizes damage at least in part by inhibiting apoptosis through downregulation of P53 [59]. This inhibition of P53 expression was also dependent on EPCR and PAR1. How activating PAR1 generates anti-inflammatory activities remains an area of active investigation.",

EPCR shares considerable sequence identity to the MHC I\u2013CD1 family of molecules [35]. The crystal structure of EPCR reveals that, like the CD1 family, EPCR has a tightly bound lipid, in this case phospholipid, located in a region virtually identical to the antigen-presenting groove in the CD1 family [60] (Figure 6\n). In CD1 proteins, glycolipids bind in this grove and can have a major role in the immune response to bacterial infection [61]. In addition, deficiency of CD1d in mice leads to autoimmune disease [62]. From the structural similarities, it is probable, but as yet unproven, that EPCR might have roles similar to those of CD1 molecules in the regulation of inflammation. Autoantibodies to EPCR and a correlation with autoimmune fetal loss have recently been demonstrated [63], consistent with its involvement in immune regulation.",

            "text": "The clotting process involves molecules, such as the selectins, that were originally thought to be involved primarily in inflammation (Box 1). Natural anticoagulant proteins exhibit a spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities, including inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling, inhibiting complement C5a and bradykinin and preventing apoptosis. Severe acute inflammatory challenges can downregulate the natural anticoagulants, thereby diminishing their ability to dampen the coagulant and inflammatory responses. When this happens, a progressive cycle can evolve in which the coagulation increases the inflammatory response, thereby increasing the coagulant response until severe vascular and organ injury occurs. Modulation of this complex series of interactive events promises to offer an attractive method for intervening clinically in diseases involving acute inflammatory challenges, such as severe sepsis. The recent successful demonstration that recombinant activated protein C can reduce the 28-day all cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis [69] provides support for this proposal.Box 1Questions for future researchThe exact signaling mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of natural anticoagulants need to be characterized more fully. At the preclinical level, differences in the protective effects of natural anticoagulants need to be explored more fully, particularly in situations where disease has already progressed, as would almost always be the case in patients. Future research will also need to address the impact of common disease processes, such as diabetes, on both the innate immune response and the ability of natural anticoagulant pathways to modulate the innate immune response. Combinations of microarray and proteomics approaches might aid in these studies.In addition, although our understanding of the regulation of blood coagulation in systems with artificial membrane surfaces is relatively sophisticated, cellular control of coagulation is still an emerging area. For instance, activated protein C is a potent anticoagulant involving liposomes. By contrast, it is a relatively poor anticoagulant on platelet surfaces. In model systems of blood coagulation, in which platelets are present over endothelium, it appears that activated protein C anticoagulant functions occur on the endothelial cell rather than the platelet surface [76]. The nature of the membrane surface responsible for these differences remains to be elucidated.",

Several possibilities could explain the failure of the natural anticoagulants TFPI and antithrombin in the trials. First, in the clinical situation, bleeding complications limit dosage to a greater extent than in the animal studies. For instance, the anticoagulant doses in the baboon sepsis model were much higher than in the human trials [74]. Therefore, the doses of the anticoagulants might not have been adequate. In the antithrombin trial, heparin was used in many of the patients [70]. As noted earlier, heparin blocks several cellular effects of antithrombin. Although there was no overall effect on survival with antithromin, the patients with heparin alone or antithrombin alone tended to have a better survival rate than the patients who received both [70].",
