All these may lead to increased severity of COVID-19 infection in diabetic individuals.[\n4\n] Moreover, genetic polymorphism of ACE receptor has been shown to be linked with diabetes and it might also facilitate COVID-19 infections. A single mutation in ACE receptor significantly increases the ability of COVID-19 virus to bind with human ACE receptor.[\n4\n] On contrary to this, some researchers say that use of ACE inhibitor or ARBs prevents the binding of COVID-19 virus to ACE receptor and thus may prevent infection. Moreover, these scientists say that ACE inhibitor or ARBs could be used as treatment modality.[\n5\n] All these are the lacunae in the existing knowledge of ACE inhibitor or ARBs use in diabetic individuals.",

Avoid hypoglycemia as patient should keep biscuit, sugar candy with them, so that whenever they have sign and symptoms of hypoglycemia, they prevent this grave complication by consuming it. Diabetic individuals should be vaccinated against pneumonia and influenza. Appropriate attentions should be given to diet especially in terms of protein, vitamins and minerals.",
