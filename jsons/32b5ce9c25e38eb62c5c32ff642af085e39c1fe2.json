We, as physicians, adapt as best we know how, working tirelessly as strong multidisciplinary groups to ensure that despite these extraordinary times, we continue to put our patients' needs first.

Hobfoll et al [6] described five empirically supported intervention principles to guide and inform intervention efforts in the presence of early and mid-term mass trauma: a sense of safety; calming; a sense of self and community efficacy; connectedness; and hope. Based on these principles, the primary goal of 'Buddy Up' is to alleviate Covid-19 pandemic-related stress by recognising the importance of being connected and building a community to ground our stress and strengthen resilience. Our system asks oncologists to group together in twos or threes for daily check-ins, monitoring each other for stress that may become distress via phone call, email or text message.",
