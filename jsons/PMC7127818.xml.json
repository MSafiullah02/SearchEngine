            "text": "Although viral RNA elements obviously play an important role in directing the transcription of the genomes and anti-genomes of RNA viruses, the transactivation response (TAR) element remains unique in that it promotes the efficient transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA by cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus, that is, it encodes not only the canonical structural proteins and enzymes found in all retroviruses (Gag, Pol, and Env) but also four auxiliary proteins and two regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Mutational analysis of HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional tat gene showed that these were replication defective due to a dramatic drop in transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element (Fisher et al., 1986, Kao et al., 1987). Subsequent analysis mapped the target site for the Tat protein to a \u223c50 base pair (bp) element located immediately 3\u2032 to the transcription start site. TAR folds into a simple RNA stem-loop structure that represents the actual target for Tat function (Feng and Holland, 1988).",

The resulting complex of Tat and P-TEPb binds directly to HIV-1 TAR via the terminal loop and an adjacent RNA bulge. Once bound to TAR, P-TEFb mediates the phosphorylation of negative regulators of transcription elongation and of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAP II molecules that have initiated transcription of HIV-1 proviral DNA. These phosphorylation events render RNAP II elongation competent and allow it to transcribe the entire viral genome (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005, Kao et al., 1987). In contrast, in the absence of Tat or TAR, transcription initiation at the LTR promoter still occurs but almost all of these initiating RNAP II molecules fall off the DNA template within \u223c200 bp of the transcription start site. Analysis of Tat function led to the realization that not only transcription initiation but also transcription elongation can regulate gene expression levels in animal cells (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005).",

In the case of HIV-1, this initial transcript can also be processed into fully spliced transcripts encoding the Tat and Rev proteins of HIV-1 as well as the auxiliary protein Nef. Alternatively, this transcript can be processed into partially spliced mRNAs encoding the three other viral auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpu, and Vpr. The HIV-1 replication cycle, therefore, requires that the single initial viral transcript is exported out of the nucleus in several differentially spliced forms. These include an unspliced form that programs Gag and Pol expression and that is packaged into virion progeny; partially spliced forms that program expression of Env, Vif, Vpr, and Vpu; and fully spliced forms that program expression of Tat, Rev, and Nef (Cullen, 2003).",

The strategy that HIV-1 has evolved to circumvent this nuclear retention is dependent on the viral Rev protein, which is translated from a fully spliced viral mRNA that is constitutively exported from the nucleus. As a result, HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional rev gene are able to express the proteins encoded by fully spliced viral mRNAs, that is, Tat, Nef, and the defective Rev protein itself, but cannot express any of the proteins encoded by incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, including Gag, Pol, and Env. The transcripts encoding these viral structural proteins, however, can be detected in the nucleus of cells infected by Rev-deficient viruses, where they are either degraded or eventually fully spliced and then exported (Cullen, 2003).",

Rev in turn interacts with a cellular factor called CRM1 that belongs to the karyopherin family of nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins (Fischer et al., 1995).

            "text": "An important part of the answer emerged from analysis of a second retrovirus called Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). MPMV has a simpler genomic organization than HIV-1 and only encodes the three structural proteins Gag, Pol, and Env. Nevertheless, MPMV expresses both a genome-length Gag/Pol mRNA and a spliced Env mRNA. As MPMV does not encode a Rev homolog, how do the incompletely spliced genomic MPMV mRNAs reach the cytoplasm? This question led to the discovery of an RNA stem-loop structure within the MPMV genome, the constitutive transport element (CTE), that mediates the nuclear export of incompletely spliced mRNAs in the absence of any viral proteins (Bray et al., 1994). Further analysis revealed that the CTE recruits a heterodimer of two cellular proteins, Tap and p15, that also plays a critical role in the nuclear export of the majority of cellular mRNAs (Gr\u00fcter et al., 1988, Kohler and Hurt, 2007). Normally, the Tap/p15 heterodimer is only recruited to mature, fully spliced mRNAs. However, the CTE is able to prematurely recruit Tap/p15 to partially spliced mRNAs and thereby circumvents the nuclear retention of incompletely spliced MPMV mRNAs. Although CTEs have now been defined in several other exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, not all CTEs act by directly recruiting Tap/p15. In particular, the avian leukemia virus CTE does not appear to bind to Tap or p15 directly, although Tap may be required for its function (LeBlanc et al., 2007). Further analysis may reveal new insights into how the export of retroviral nuclear mRNAs is regulated.",

For the majority of cellular mRNAs, it is initiated by the recruitment of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F to the mRNA 5\u2032 cap (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008) (see Review by N. Sonenberg and A.G. Hinnebusch in this issue of Cell). eIF4F consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and a third protein, eIF4G. The role of eIF4G is to facilitate recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex, consisting of the 40S ribosomal subunit, found in a complex with the initiator methionine tRNA (Met-tRNAi) and other eIFs, to the mRNA cap. Once recruited to the cap, the 40S subunit then scans along the mRNA searching for the translation initiation codon. At this point, the 60S ribosomal subunit is also recruited and translation initiation occurs (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008).",

The IRES directly recruits several eIFs and the 40S ribosomal subunit to an internal viral translation initiation codon without the requirement for either cap binding or 5\u2032UTR scanning. As a result, poliovirus translation is independent of the host cell cap recognition factor eIF4E. Moreover, although poliovirus translation initiation does require eIF4G, it functions perfectly well with the carboxy-terminal fragment of eIF4G that is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G by a virus-encoded protease. Because cap-dependent translation requires full-length eIF4G, this cleavage blocks host cell translation, whereas viral mRNA translation is not only unimpeded but in fact is enhanced by the access of viral mRNAs to the entire pool of available eIFs and ribosomal subunits (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008).",

Surprisingly, these exist in several functionally distinct classes. For example, the HCV IRES, unlike the poliovirus IRES, can directly recruit 40S ribosomal subunits to the viral internal translation initiation codon in the absence of eIFs, although eIFs do participate in the process of translation initiation (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008). An even more unusual IRES is found in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a picornavirus-like insect virus (Jan et al., 2003, Pestova and Hellen, 2003). The CrPV IRES not only is able to recruit both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits to assemble elongation-competent 80S ribosomes on viral mRNAs but also acts as a mimic of Met-tRNAi to permit initiation of the translation of viral capsid proteins in the absence of Met-tRNAi.",

            "text": "Another interesting translational phenomenon observed in several virus families, including many species of retroviruses and all coronaviruses, is programmed ribosomal frameshifting (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006). In retroviruses such as HIV-1, frameshifting prevents some ribosomes from terminating translation at the end of the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the Gag structural protein and instead induces ribosomes to shift into the overlapping pol ORF, resulting in the production of the large Gag-Pol polyprotein. Similarly, in coronaviruses, ribosomal frameshifting is used to produce the 1a/1b replicase polyprotein rather than the shorter 1a variant. Frameshifting is induced by a bipartite element consisting of a 5\u2032 frameshifting site and an adjacent 3\u2032 RNA structure (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006, Jacks et al., 1988). The frameshift site has the consensus sequence X_XXY_YYZ (where the translational phase is indicated), which then slips into the \u22121 frame, that is, XXX_YYY_Z. The actual shift sites found in HIV-1 and the SARS coronavirus are U_UUU_UUA and U_UUA_AAC, respectively. The 3\u2032 RNA structure found in HIV-1 is thought to be a simple RNA hairpin but other \u22121 frameshifting signals instead contain a pseudoknot 3\u2032 to the frameshift signal (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006). It has been proposed that the function of the 3\u2032 RNA structure is to induce transient ribosomal pausing at the frameshift site to facilitate ribosomal slippage in the \u22121 direction. Although frameshifting in HIV-1 occurs with an efficiency of \u223c5%, frameshifting efficiency in other viruses can be as high as \u223c25% and may be facilitated by a direct interaction between the paused ribosome and the downstream pseudoknot structure. Programmed frameshifting is not unique to viruses but is found also in a small number of cellular genes in both eukaryotes and bacteria (Shigemoto et al., 2001, Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990).",

The triggers for RNAi in these species are the long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that form critical intermediates in the replication of all RNA viruses except retroviruses. These dsRNAs are bound by the RNase III-related enzyme Dicer, which progressively cleaves these dsRNAs into \u223c22 bp RNA duplexes containing terminal 2 nt 3\u2032 overhangs (see Review by R.W. Carthew and E.J. Sontheimer in this issue of Cell). One strand of this duplex, called a small-interfering RNA (siRNA), is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it acts as a guide for RNA to target RISC to complementary regions of viral genomic, anti-genomic, or mRNA species. RISC then cleaves these viral RNAs, leading to their degradation. The first siRNAs to be identified were in fact antiviral siRNAs produced in tobacco cells infected by a pathogenic RNA virus, potato virus X (Hamilton and Baulcombe, 1999).",

Because of the importance of RNAi as an antiviral defense in plants and insects, many RNA viruses that infect these species have evolved gene products that inhibit RNAi and, hence, enhance virus replication. Conversely, the absence of antiviral RNAi responses in mammalian cells means that the RNAi machinery in these cells generally remains active during viral infection (Figure 1).",

After excision, by the sequential action of the host cell RNase III-related enzymes Drosha and Dicer, miRNAs are loaded into RISC and downregulate the expression of cellular mRNAs. Unlike viral mRNA targets of viral siRNAs, cellular mRNAs are rarely fully complementary to cellular miRNAs. As full complementarity is a prerequisite for efficient cleavage by RISC, cellular mRNAs are generally not subject to degradation by cellular miRNAs.

LAT is an \u223c8.3 kb capped polyadenylated RNA that is the only viral RNA expressed at high levels in neurons latently infected with HSV-1. LAT is spliced to give an unstable \u223c6.3 kb exonic RNA and a stable \u223c2 kb intron. The instability of the 6.3 kb LAT RNA appears to be due to the fact that it is processed into several viral miRNAs that may play a key role in regulating HSV-1 latency (Umbach et al., 2008). The role of the stable 2 kb LAT intron is less clear, but evidence has been presented arguing that the LAT intron is exported out of the nucleus by CRM1 and associates with cellular ribosomes, thus suggesting a role in modulating mRNA translation in neurons latently infected with HSV-1 (Atanasiu and Fraser, 2007).",

This interaction stabilizes the production of ATP in infected cells and also inhibits virally induced apoptosis (Reeves et al., 2007). Another noncoding RNA, the VA1 RNA expressed by adenovirus, also binds to a cellular factor to inhibit an antiviral response. In this case, the target is protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular protein that binds to the long dsRNAs produced by adenoviruses and many other pathogenic viruses. Binding of dsRNA by PKR induces PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of cellular eIF2\u03b1, which results in a global inhibition of translation in the infected host cell. VA1, a highly structured \u223c160 nt-long noncoding RNA, binds to PKR with high affinity and blocks PKR dimerization and activation. This prevents the inhibition of translation induced by adenovirus-derived dsRNAs and allows virus replication to proceed unimpeded (Mathews and Shenk, 1991). Interestingly, both hCMV \u03b22.7 and adenovirus VA1, like KSHV PAN and HSV-1 LAT, are also expressed at high levels in infected cells. \u03b22.7 comprises up to 20% of all viral transcripts in hCMV-infected cells, and adenovirus VA1 is expressed at an extraordinarily high number of copies (\u223c108) per infected cell. Presumably, these high expression levels facilitate the saturation of cellular binding sites for these RNAs.",

However, such analyses have also led to several key insights into how not only infected cells but also uninfected cells regulate the expression of their genome. Moreover, as noted in the brief discussion of viral noncoding RNAs, our knowledge of how virally encoded transcripts work in the host cell remains far from complete. Clearly, future research into virus replication will provide unexpected and exciting insights into the complex molecular machinery that makes human cells tick.",

Nuclear export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 transcripts is facilitated by the RRE RNA structure, which recruits a complex consisting of the viral Rev protein and cellular CRM1. A similar function is performed by the CTE RNA structure present in MPMV, which recruits the cellular Tap nuclear export factor. The cytoplasmic translation of picornaviral mRNAs is facilitated by IRES elements, and the translation of retroviral and coronaviral mRNAs is modulated by sequences that induce ribosomal frameshifting. Finally, the translation of both viral and cellular mRNAs can be specifically downregulated by virally encoded microRNAs.",
