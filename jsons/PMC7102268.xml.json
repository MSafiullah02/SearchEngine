            "text": "As the prevalence of women living with HIV rises, increase attention is needed to the long-term health maintenance and care in this specific population. In the general population, breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women (excluding skin cancer) in the US. and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women with an estimate of 232,670 new cases to be diagnosed in 2014, causing about 40,000 deaths each year from the disease [1\u20133]. It is well established that since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals has increased, while the incidence of both opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) has dramatically decreased [4, 5] With this shift, the rate of Non AIDS-Defining Cancers (NADCs) has risen and now accounts for the majority of cancers in HIV-infected persons [6]. For breast cancer, however, initial reports documented a decrease incidence in cohorts from HIV patients relative to the general population [7\u201310]. Later studies have suggested that the risk has increased significantly in the last years and is now approaching the risk of the general population [11\u201316]. According to the latest report of the World Health Organization [17], the proportion of women living with HIV has been increasing in the last 10 years and now constitutes 50 % of people living with HIV worldwide, the cases of breast cancer in this population are therefore expected to increase.",

In 2001, we reported our experience with 20 patients with breast cancer and HIV and it was the largest cohort to that date [18]. Since then, even though there have been continuous reports, it still remains the report of small case series and a few series linking cancer to HIV registries [9, 11, 13, 15, 19\u201325]. The recent report of 151 patients in Soweto, Africa [12] constitutes the largest cohort to date and they reported equal prevalence to the HIV-negative cohort; however, no information regarding treatment and outcome was given. There are currently no approved guidelines or recommendations for screening or for treating HIV patients with breast cancer and clinicians must make decisions despite the lack of well-validated data regarding outcomes, tolerability, safety, interactions, and management of predictive clinical variables unique to HIV patients like CD4 and viral load [11, 26].",

The incidence of myelosuppression with chemotherapy appears to be higher in the HIV-infected population based on our initial report [18] where 5 out of 7 patients developed myelosuppression, and these findings have also been reported in others experience [20, 29]. In our updated and larger cohort, the incidence of serious adverse events was documented in 14 out of 30 patients that receive chemotherapy which reflects a proportionally decrease in the rate of complications. In addition to myelosuppression, zoster was a common complication as was thrush and vaginal candidiasis. In an attempt to minimize chemotherapy-related complication, we have adopted a number of strategies. We use weekly therapy rather than every 3 week therapy and we never use dose dense regimens since Burstein reported the occurrence of pneumocystisis carinii pneumonia in 2 women without HIV infection treated with dose dense AC-T [30]. We use ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen in women whose tumors are estrogen receptor positive instead of chemotherapy. We avoid steroid premedication when possible and we substitute Nab-Paclitaxel for Paclitaxel on occasion to avoid weekly steroid administration. We use growth factor support liberally and give prophylactic fluconazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and acyclovir to most women receiving chemotherapy. In patients with space occupying lesions of the brain we initiate therapy for toxoplasmosis. If there is no response to therapy for toxoplasmosis and the csf shows no Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection we consider that the patient has metastatic breast cancer to the brain and treat accordingly.",
