CBT has been proven effective for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and has begun to be applied for psychosomatic problems in the dental patients. The prevalence of TMD in a community sample was almost 17.5% and the incidence even higher during the worldwide epidemic. Studies reported that CBT was more effective than no treatment.1 Although CBTs were mainly conducted by psychologists, those conducted by trained dental hygienists were also found to be effective in reducing TMD pain and pain-related interference.",
