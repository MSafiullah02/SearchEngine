One of these unintended stories led to a much bigger audience of TED community and spread the word about IR far beyond the circle of my friends. As the TED slogan promised, participating in the event 1 made me realize that our ideas of better medicine are worth sharing. It also made me think that better communication with the public is possible, and it does not take genius. It takes a willingness to try.",

The starting point is to accept that many people, including medical professionals, do not know what diseases we can treat and what diagnostic or therapeutic services we can provide.",

This is where radiology nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants can play an incredibly important role. In the current patient-centered value-based healthcare system, radiology nurses are at the forefront of patient care and interdepartmental communication. They can pre-screen the patients at the emergency rooms and initiate IR consults, maintain long-term comprehensive wound care for patients with chronic limb ischemia, or participate in interdisciplinary tumor boards and provide patient stewardship during oncologic treatments. The unique position of nurses is that they do not merely address the patient's symptoms, but also build an ongoing relationship promoting patients' trust and confidence. After all, we understand that, when offered new procedures and new technologies, patients tend to trust and more accurately follow the advice of those who understand their family conditions, culture, and beliefs. The social dimension is as essential as the scientific expertise. In this work against sickness, we begin not with genetic or cellular interactions, but with human ones. 3 Finally, during the critical times of COVID-19 pandemic when every healthcare resource is at the dearth 4 , it is more than ever vital to provide the most efficient patient triage, perform the least invasive procedures with consequent faster discharge, and efficiently engage all members of the team to provide care for the sick. Current healthcare catastrophe makes a powerful moral argument to promote the culture of minimally invasive comprehensive clinical care of IR.",
