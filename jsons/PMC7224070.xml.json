For instance, the acute renal failure trial network (ATN) study included more than 1000 patients with severe AKI and showed that intensive RRT strategies (more frequent intermittent hemodialysis or higher dose of continuous hemofiltration) did not improve mortality [4]. A post hoc analysis of this trial [5], concluded that more intensive modalities were associated with a greater reduction in urine output during the first 7 days of therapy. In the subgroup of hemodynamically stable patients [6] who received intermittent RRT, increasing frequency from 3 to 6 days per week was associated with impaired renal recovery at day 28. An individual patient data meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (on both continuous and intermittent RRT) confirmed that higher RRT intensity delayed renal function recovery [7].",

(2) During recovery from AKI, the kidneys are more susceptible to further injury, which can result in new deterioration of renal function (full black line) rather than recovery (green line). (3) Patients can recover their kidney function after starting RRT (full blue line). This recovery is often incomplete, which can result in progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; full lilac line).
