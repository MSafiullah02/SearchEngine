Depression rates in many advanced countries are higher in mid-life than at other ages. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) for the United States 2009\u20132012, showed that 7.6% of American adults aged 20 and over had depression (moderate or severe depressive symptoms) in a given 2-week period (Pratt and Brody, 2014). Depression rates were 7.4% for those age 18-39; 9.8% for ages 40-59 and 5.4% for those aged sixty and over.",

Indeed, they show the decline in well-being was about the equivalent of that observed from losing a spouse or a job. The results on unhappiness are similar. For example, in the Gallup USDTP averaged across the years 2008-2017 the probability of depression in the raw data rose from 12% at age 18 to 21% at age 58. The proportion of the employed who were depressed was 12% versus 24% for the unemployed. In addition, 12% of the married were depressed yesterday versus 19% of the widowed. In the raw data from the BRFSS the proportion who said they had 20 or more bad days in a month was 6.6% at age 18 and 8.4 at age 47, the peak. Among the married the rate was 5.5% versus 8% for the widowed. The rise in unhappiness to the mid-life peak, is thus large and comparable in magnitude to major life events.",

A third is that a kind of comparison process is at work: I have seen school-friends die and come eventually to value my blessings during my remaining years.

Some especially defenseless individuals might face downward spirals as age and life circumstances interact. Many will not be getting the social/emotional support they need as they are isolated and lonely, in addition to the first-order effects of whatever they are coping with in normal times. Lack of health care coverage in the US may well be a compounding factor where there is also an obesity epidemic.
