Nonetheless, members of each tend to share the general perspectives, attitudes, and range of concerns we sketch at the outset. We then confront Reds and Greens with potentially divisive cases; the production of an oncostatic drug, Taxol, and the farming of pigs for consumption. In both cases, corporate practices provide Reds and Greens with common cause for moral censure, but also occasions for finding common grounds for a deeper alliance.",

            "text": "Let us start, however, by reflecting on a somewhat analogous initially fraught alliance between environmental ethics and animal liberationism. In a 1980 article, J. Baird Callicott rejected the idea that such an alliance could be made (Callicott 1980) . He distinguished three general approaches to ethical problems: ethical humanism, humane moralism, and ethical holism. Humanism applies to individual human concerns; the humane approach applies to our treatment of sentient animals, human and nonhuman; holism is his preferred approach to our environmental crises as it takes the good of the system as a whole as a basic value. He argued that human, humane, and environmental concerns were quite distinct and that ethical theories that focused on the former two employed atomistic and reductionist arguments and diverged only in their assessment of which individuals to include in the scope of moral concern. Environmental ethics, on the other hand, employs communitarian arguments and includes individual sentient beings, other living beings, and whole ecosystems, in their moral assessments of policies and practices. Other scholars, as well as activists concerned with environmental ethics, tended to agree with Callicott. The sentiment was made pointedly clear in the title of an article by Mark Sagoff-\"Animal Liberation and Environmental Ethics: Bad Marriage, Quick Divorce\" (Sagoff 1984) . At that time there was a growing consensus that humanism's anthropocentrism made it inadequate as a basis for both animal ethics and environmental ethics, and that animal rights theories in their individualism were incompatible with environmental ethics.",

Jamieson suggests that the divisions among environmental ethics are just as significant as those between environmental ethics and animal liberation and that animal liberation is one type of environmental ethic.

Reds focus on individual human patients' health and insofar as there is a concern for the environment, it tends to be only for those environmental matters that negatively bear on their patients' health. More precisely, physicians in principle commit themselves to serving individual patients' \"best interests\". Like a photographer's shallow depth of field, this focus renders a particular patient in sharp detail, with everyone and everything else in a blurry background. They have no inclination or reason to directly value the environment, apart from its bearing on those \"best interests\". Indeed, as the principle source of pathogens and predators, Nature may seem to be a threat best kept at bay by wholesale antiseptic or other chemical measures. 3 Since Reds tend to focus on the relationships between health care providers and 2 When we use the terms \"Reds\" or \"Greens\" we have in mind biomedical ethicists and those individuals and communities that are the subject of biomedical ethical discussions (e.g. patients, health care providers, medical researchers, health professionals, and the like) and environmental ethicists and the subjects of their ethical discussions (e.g. humans, other animals, ecosystems, environmental professionals and activists). their patients, this would seem to show them to be the ethical humanists Callicott had in mind.",

Indeed, current Greens go well beyond Aldo Leopold's focus on the \"land community\" to include concern for the whole biosphere, even the whole planetary system on which biota depend. They have also become concerned about animals in feedlots and laboratories far removed from \"the land\" and other forms of non-human life. To that extent, our Greens' holism includes sentient fauna and nonsentient flora, as well as abiotic components of ecosystems. Against such an encompassing moral landscape human patients and their particular relations to individual health care providers may seem an insignificant few amongst many, and medical researchers and their pharma sponsors appear primarily as despoilers and polluters.",

In various contexts, biomedical ethicists widen their focus to include the interests of other current or future patients or the public more generally. Most physicians need to ration their time and attention among hospital and office patients, some of whose \"best interests\" need more time and attention. And when drugs, organs, or staff are in short supply, physicians need to survey and rank patients, first treating the worst off and delaying or denying treatment to others. In checking contagious diseases, they need to think about people not yet exposed, as well as the animals who are or could be vectors. Likewise, in enrolling patients in randomized clinical trials of drugs or procedures, physicians may be as much or more concerned with the large class of future patients who may benefit than with the particular patient being enrolled with less than an even chance of benefit. In actuality, Reds often have the illness and health of others in mind in ways that may compromise the \"best interests\" of the patient in the bed or chair in front of them. Their usual individualistic focus becomes, on these occasions, wider and more akin to that of Greens, even if not as comprehensive in scope.",

Tree-sitters will anthropomorphize \"their\" tree and if they are to lose that individual, the loss is both symbolic and personal.

            "text": "These differences of scale and focus make for differences in the theories and policies to which Reds and Greens incline. Attending to individual patients, Reds are inclined to theories and practices that stress patient and professional autonomy, rights, and freedom from coercion except in emergencies and epidemics. They may invoke the power of government only in the framing and policing of public health policies, as well as for taxation needed to support medical research and to fund medical treatment. Greens, by contrast, are given to framing issues in terms of competing harms, benefits, and values and often look to government regulation as a political means for promoting their values. Greens are critical of the traditional focus on individual human rights, particularly property rights, as they are thought to license exploitative use of natural resources. Though some Greens want to assert the \"rights of nature\" and some animal liberation theorists would like to extend the class of rights holders to include non-human animals, Greens, in general, tend to focus on harms and benefits and an appreciation of living beings and systems as \"teleological centers\" for whom things can go better or worse (see, for example, Taylor 1986 and Plumwood 1993) . For Greens, arguing about harms, benefits, and promoting organisms' and systems' telic ends is more direct and compelling than trying to establish the \"rights of nature\". This also allows Greens to avoid the theoretical complexities of attaching rights not just to individuals but also to potentially diverse collectives. Harms and benefits are part of a more general framework of values, are more easily defined and debated, and have the potential to be more inclusive.",

Some skeptics declared the end of the \"Golden Age of Medicine\" when new, highly contagious diseasessuch as AIDS, SARS, and Ebola-suddenly appeared in the late 20th century. But within a short time the pathogens were identified, various treatments discovered, and the spread of the diseases containable with suitable government support. Admittedly, the \"war on cancer\" has not gone as well as predicted, but there have been some impressive victories and new grounds for predicting further progress against tumors that resist current treatments. New drugs are greeted and prescribed as \"promising\", even for off-label uses yet to be tested. When drugs fail to fulfill these promises, physicians are confident that better drugs are forthcoming, even if current patients may not live to benefit from them. Even when patients have not responded to a particular sequence of drugs, physicians foster and share the hope that a yet-untried remedy will work, even if it has helped few other patients in the past.",

There have been local improvements in water and land quality, remediation of brownfields and contaminated rivers, but initial successes on a larger scale have proved temporary (for example, ozone-hole contraction and improved Californian air quality). Moreover, there are frequent cases of counter-productive projects; for example, a reduction of chemical pollution that unexpectedly fosters predators that decimate the class of plants or animals one is trying to protect. Attempts at reintroducing critically endangered species such as whooping cranes or great apes back into their natural habitats have met with mixed success. Attempts to eliminate invasive species in order to promote or protect native plants and animals more often than not set off a cascade of unintended consequences. Recently, political inability to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, itself a disappointment, has led some to begin discussing geoengineering projects as a solution to global climate change. Suggested interventions include: deflecting a small percentage of incoming radiation from the Sun by placing huge mirrors at the Lagrange point between it and the Earth; fertilizing the oceans with plant life to soak up more carbon dioxide; and capturing vast quantities of emissions from power plants and burying them in sedimentary rock deep underground (for a groundbreaking analysis of the moral hazards raised by geoengineering see Gardiner 2010) . Such suggestions, however, find little favor with Greens. Given the history of disappointments and failures, human intervention into natural systems is generally thought to be a very bad idea by most Greens. These failures also contribute to a hopelessness that humans will be able to do anything useful to protect the natural world.",

Consequently, NCI ordered many tons of the bark to provide enough Taxol for large randomized clinical trials and gave Bristol-Meyers a five-year monopoly on the testing, production, and distribution of the drug. Oncologists, of course, hailed this promising drug, for they had little to offer patients with Stage III ovarian cancer.

Green champion, Al Gore, set Reds an example when charged with caring less for a single woman than for the six trees whose bark might save her.

This would entail suspending optimism about new Taxol alternatives well before Yew bark requirements threaten the species. But neither modification is a radical change: the longrange view is common in public health; and among optimists only Candide expects the desired outcome in every context. As for Greens, they need only adjust their focus to bring suffering individuals into clearer view, and so be willing to allow some risk to the non-sentient Yew for the sake of pain-relief among other valued living things. This might entail suspending their pessimistic predictions about future supply and demand, but again, only extreme-mostly fictional-pessimists uniformly predict the worst.",

Worldwide, meat consumption has increased more than fivefold since 1950, and now an estimated 53 billion animals globally are killed each year. Factory farms, the largescale, intensive confinement operations that government agencies and industry now refer to as CAFOs-concentrated animal feeding operations-control every aspect of the animals' lives from birth through slaughter. 4 In the United States, roughly 2% of all farms produce 40% of the animals consumed, while their corporate owners are opening more factory farms in countries that have relatively lax regulations and enforcement. For example, Smithfield Foods, the world's largest producer of hogs, expanded their factory farming operations into Romania, one of the poorest countries in the European Union, as well as to Mexico, with notable costs to human and animals alike. By mass-producing pigs, Smithfield Foods is able to manipulate the market, and in Romania, after temporarily lowering prices, roughly 90% of the small family farms were forced out of business in just a four-year period (Carvajal and Castle 2009 ). Many of the farmers sold their land and left the country to look for work. And its not just livelihoods that factory farming destroys, but quality of life in the communities in which they are located. In Iowa alone, hogs excrete 50 million tons of manure annually, and overall farm animals produce three tons of manure for each American (Bittman 2008) . In the US, factory farms are usually located in poorer rural areas where the odor problems are more difficult to combat.",

See \"CAFOs uncovered: The untold costs of confined animal feeding operations\". A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, April 2008. Available at http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/science_and_ impacts/impacts_industrial_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.html. The relatively new CAFO terminology is potentially misleading as there is much more that happens on factory farms than animal feeding. 5 Peter Singer (in Flannery 2009) has recently argued that this underestimates the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to livestock production as it doesn't take account of the immediate impact of methane: \"discussions about which human activities contribute most to climate change are usually framed in terms of the impact those activities will have over the next century. Taking that perspective, a ton of methane is generally regarded as 25 times more potent, in causing global warming, than a ton of carbon dioxide \u2026 The reason why, over the next century, methane will be only 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide in causing global warming is that it breaks down much more quickly \u2026 Suppose that instead of taking 100 years as our time frame, we asked which emissions will contribute to climate change over the next 20 years. Then the difference in breakdown becomes less significant, and a ton of methane is not 25 but 72 times more potent than a ton of carbon dioxide in warming our planet\" (133-134). the leading source of water pollution. (Steinfeld et al. 2006, 267) The increased attention that factory farming has received by national and international organizations may be, in part, a result of the work that environmentalists and animal liberationists (both activists and scholars) have done to try to expose the problems with modern food production.",

(Harrison 1964, vii) Besides the question Carson raised, concerns about safety and the human health impact of factory farming were rarely posed initially. Yet in the past few years the public health risks associated with intensive rearing of food animals have captured global attention. Links between human health threats such as mad cow disease, salmonella, and avian and swine flu viruses and factory farms, not to mention links between the \"intensivist\" mindset and fast food, and increased rates of obesity and diabetes, have finally provided the impetus for a re-examination of this system of food production.",

They are also genetically similar enough to humans that they are susceptible to human flu viruses. They are also susceptible to avian viruses, and have been referred to as \"mixing vessels\" in which strains of human, avian, and swine influenza swap genetic material to become ever more potent. The potent viruses can jump from pigs to humans and back again. Virologists have suggested that pigs were the intermediate hosts responsible for the birth of the last two flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968 as well as the current influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) (See Wuetrich 2003; and Smith et al. 2009 ). Not surprisingly, large concentrations of pigs, as exist on factory farms, increase the risk of human exposure to these viruses because the humans who work on factory farms come in contact with a large number of animals on a regular basis. The first known cases of the 2009 pandemic were reported in the village of La Gloria, near Perote in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Perote is home of Smithfield Foods subsidiary Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a factory farm operation that brought almost one million hogs to market in 2008 and owns 56,000 sows. Although Smithfield claims it found \"no clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in the company's swine herd or its employees at its joint ventures in Mexico\" and scientists have now reported that the virus probably began infecting humans months before the infections gained attention, there have been heightened calls for increased oversight of intensive animal production. Factory farms are incubators of disease and the regular use of antibiotics to prevent disease is contributing to multidrug resistance, which is making it harder to contain illness. Increasingly, governments, as well as health and consumer protection organizations, are realizing that the way animals are raised on factory farms is directly linked to a negative impact on human health.",
