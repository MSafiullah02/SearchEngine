In the cases of neutropenic patients most abscesses will not contain pus but watery fl uid containing no neutrophils. These instances are best treated with antibiotics and granulocyte stimulating factor; any areas of fl uctuation can be aspirated with a fi ne needle to provide fl uid for culture and sensitivity testing often without the need for incision and drainage.",

On examination the foot is plantar fl exed with tight lower leg muscle compartments. There may be reduced skin sensation over the foot or parasthesia. The pathognomonic sign is extreme pain on the slightest attempt to actively or passively move the foot. Loss of pedal pulses is a late fi nding.

Though muscle compartments expand markedly after release, use of a loose subdermal tacking suture allows apposition of the wound edge without increasing the compartment pressures. This reduces the need for skin grafting and thus gives a much better cosmetic result. Hemostasis with bipolar diathermy must be done scrupulously as bleeding is a major problem postoperatively. Numerous debridements of dead muscle may be required, although this should be left until demarcation has occurred. Delayed primary closure, tissue fl aps, or skin graft may be used subsequently.",

Ultrasound examination is relatively inexpensive, avoids ionizing radiation, and can be performed at the bedside. However, it must be remembered that ultrasound is operator-dependent and that excessive bowel gas, especially in the older child, can adversely affect the images; hence a negative scan does not necessarily rule out intra-abdominal pathology. A CT scan is also noninvasive and requires both intravenous and oral contrast. Restless children will require sedation or general anesthetic for the study. In the immunocompromised patient, CT may demonstrate intra-abdominal abscesses, pseudomembranous colitis, typhlitis, graft-versushost disease, radiation enteritis, and appendicitis [ 25 , 72 ] .",

The main indication for surgery is perforation. Patients with strictures are best treated conservatively, initially with bowel rest and decompression followed by low residue diets [ 24 , 118 ] . If obstruction or fi stula makes operative intervention necessary then great care must be taken to handle the bowel gently and avoid resection wherever possible. A high incidence of anastomotic leaks follows bowel resection of irradiated bowel due to a compromised blood supply and poor wound healing. Extensive dissection of adhesions should be avoided and a side-to-side bypass operation considered in some cases. When a resection is inevitable, for instance after perforation or in response to chronic severe blood loss, then more generous resections should be made and the bowel temporarily exteriorized to avoid an anastomosis [ 38 , 118 ] .",

The use of pelvic vicryl mesh placed at the level of the sacral promontory seems to be the best option in children [ 71 ] . In a study of eight children undergoing pelvic irradiation for malignancy who had a pelvic mesh placed before radiotherapy, none suffered from radiation enteritis [ 71 ] . Adhesive Obstruction Previous laparotomy, intra-abdominal or pelvic irradiation, and intraperitoneal bleeding or sepsis may lead to adhesion formation. Hence, a child with an intraabdominal tumor is at signifi cant risk of the late complications of adhesion formation. Operation for adhesions caused by radiotherapy is unrewarding and dangerous; the bowel is often unhealthy, easily damaged, and the adhesions rapidly reform. Adhesions secondary to previous operations are best managed conservatively but failure of the obstruction to resolve after 48 h and signs of ischemia are absolute indications for laparotomy.",

Investigation of diarrhea includes sending stool culture for anaerobic organisms, C. diffi cile toxin, and microscopy and culture looking for protozoa, fungi, or viral infestation. Viral infection is of particular importance in the bone marrow transplant patients as clinically it is diffi cult to differentiate infection from acute graft-versus-host disease. The consequences of increasing the level of immunosuppression to treat graft-versus-host disease, when the patient is actually suffering from viral colitis, can result in a fatality. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are useful in making the diagnosis by providing biopsies from affected areas of colon for histology [ 55 , 121 , 127 ] . Histological examination of biopsies may show viral inclusion bodies or fungal colonies. Appropriate treatment for proven viral infection is with aciclovir or ganciclovir.",

Changes in the normal bacterial fl ora of the colon as a result of antibiotic therapy (especially clindamycin and in infants ampicillin) allows overgrowth of C. diffi cile with subsequent release of toxins that cause mucosal damage and infl ammation [ 53 ] . Clinical presentation includes mild to moderate diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis with or without pseudomembrane formation, and fulminant colitis (Figs. 31.6 and 31.7 ). Associated symptoms include abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. In instances of fulminating colitis the patient presents with an acute abdomen, fever, tachycardia, and lethargy. Toxic dilatation may develop. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of C. diffi cile toxins in the stool; sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy and biopsies may be benefi cial as most disease is confi ned to the rectum or sigmoid. However, in 10 % of cases the colitis is limited to the proximal colon. Unfortunately, colonoscopy in these latter cases, in patients with fulminant colitis, may be complicated by perforation.",

A review of the presentations and management of children with hemorrhagic cystitis after bone marrow transplantation at The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow during the period between 1990 and 1997 showed only six children who developed the disease. During this 8-year period 91 children received a bone marrow transplant. The mean age was 12 years (range 5-15 years); all had prophylaxis with hydration and Mesna. The presentation of hemorrhagic cystitis occurred on average 40 days after chemotherapy (range 26-40 days) Hemorrhagic cystitis was heralded by a period of microscopic hematuria lasting 4-12 days (mean 9 days) [ 83 ] . Use of sodium pentasan polysulfate (SPP) has been described in adults and has subsequently been used with good effect in children at Birmingham Children's Hospital (see their algorithm Fig. 31.8 ) [ 27 ] . The mechanism of sodium pentasan polysufate is taken orally and excreted in the urine and though its mechanism of action is still poorly understood it is thought to reduce the urothelial response to infl ammatory stimuli.",
