Affected live piglets were submitted for diagnostic investigation. Samples tested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for foot-and-mouth disease virus, porcine delta coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, porcine rotavirus types A, B and C, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Senecavirus A (SV-A) formerly known as Seneca Valley virus was detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from serum, skin and faeces of piglets and from serum and faeces of sows. SV-A was isolated in cell culture from piglet samples. SV-A VP1 gene region sequencing from piglet tissues was also successful. A biosecurity and disease entry evaluation was conducted and identified potential biosecurity risks factors for the entry of new pathogens into the operation. This is the first case report in the United States associating SV-A with a clinical course of severe but transient neonatal morbidity and mortality followed by vesicular lesions in breeding stock animals. Veterinarians and animal caretakers must remain vigilant for vesicular foreign animal diseases and report suspicious clinical signs and lesions to state animal health authorities for diagnostic testing and further investigation.",

Two of the sows with affected litters were anorexic but afebrile. The anorexia was attributed to recent farrowing. Sows were reported to be producing milk and did not have abnormal vaginal discharge, mastitis or lameness. Based on the clinical signs described by the producer, the clinical syndrome appeared to be affecting mainly neonatal piglets. The top differential diagnoses were porcine respiratory and reproductive virus (PRRSV) or porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV).

As the epidemiology of SV-A is poorly understood, the evaluation served as a hypothesisgenerating tool to identify areas of potential entry and to create biosecurity recommendations to prevent entry of novel pathogens. The outbreak assessment tool was based on a comprehensive list of events that potentially led to the introduction of the virus into the breeding herd.

Previous reports have described the detection of SV-A from cases of acute lameness, sudden neonatal death and vesicular disease in North and South America (Amass et al., 2004; Pasma et al., 2008; Vannucci et al., 2015) . In Brazil, epidemic transient neonatal losses, a clinical syndrome in piglets similar to the case presented here, resulted in necropsied piglets with no specific gross or histopathologic lesions . Vannucci (2015) was able to demonstrate SV-A within the spleen, liver and vesicles of affected piglets using in situ hybridization. Furthermore, another report from Brazil also described the association of abundant quantity of SV-A RNA and vesicular lesions in pigs (Leme et al., 2015) . From our case and the Brazilian cases, other causes of neonatal mortality were examined and ruled out. Further research is needed to understand whether SV-A is a primary cause of these conditions. Although virus has been identified in neonatal tissues of affected pigs, lesions are generally absent and Koch's postulates for neonatal mortality caused by SV-A have not been satisfied (Vannucci, 2015) .",
