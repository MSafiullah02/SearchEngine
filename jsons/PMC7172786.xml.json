After cleavage from the remainder of the viral polyprotein, 3Cpro remains covalently linked to 3Dpol, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This 3Cpro\u20133Dpol bi-protein binds via the 3Cpro segment to the untranslated 5\u2032-end of the genomic RNA, generally stem-loop D (SLD; Fig. 2\nA) from the first cloverleaf. This interaction is thought to correctly position the 3Dpol protein as a necessary step for transcribing positive sense RNA from a negative sense template. The lack of structural data featuring the 3Cpro\u2013SLD interaction has hindered efforts targeting drug design to this second function of 3Cpro.",

Here we report an investigation into the interaction between the HRV-14 SLD and the HRV-14 3Cpro. NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering data were combined with results from previous mutational analysis (Andino et al., 1993, Leong et al., 1993) (Fig. 1) to construct a structural model of the HRV-14 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex. The results identify the interface between 3Cpro and the RNA stem loop, showing that the RNA binds on the opposite side of the protein relative to the catalytic site, and further that there is communication between the RNA-binding and catalytic sites.",

Isotope-labelled 3Cpro from HRV-14 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using standard methods. Typically, a 50 mL overnight growth of E. coli BL21 CodonPlus cells containing the HMBP-3C plasmid was used to inoculate 1 L of LB containing chloramphenicol and ampicillin. This construct produces a histidine-tagged MBP fusion with 3Cpro that can be cleaved with thrombin (Alexandrov et al., 2001). When absorbance at 600 nm reached approximately 1.0 the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3800 rpm (GS3 rotor) and resuspended in 500 mL of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 3.5 g of 13C-glucose and 0.5 g of 15N-ammonium chloride. After 30 min at 30 \u00b0C, induction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). For production of deuterated protein, the M9 minimal medium utilised D2O with either 2H,13C-glucose or 2H,12C-glycerol as a carbon source. The culture was grown at 30 \u00b0C until the growth curve flattened (approximately 6 h).

In order to obtain the HN chemical shift perturbation values, 1H,15N-HSQC-TROSY (Pervushin et al., 1998) spectra were acquired with the 3CI and 3CIR samples. TROSY versions of the HSQC, HNCA (Eletsky et al., 2001, Salzmann et al., 1998) and HNCO (Permi et al., 2000) experiments were used to assign the 3CIR backbone resonances with the software package Analysis (Vranken et al., 2005). The 1H\u201315N RDCs for the 3CI sample were obtained using an IPAP-HSQC sequence (Cordier et al., 1999).",

Data reduction to I(q) vs. q (where q\n = (4\u03c0sin\u03b8)/\u03bb, 2\u03b8 is the scattering angle and \u03bb\n = 1.54 \u00c5, the wavelength of the radiation) and solvent subtractions were performed with the program SAXSquant1D (Anton Paar, Austria), while subsequent desmearing calculations were performed with the program GNOM (Semenyuk and Svergun, 1991). Radius of gyration (Rg) and zero-angle scattering (I(0)) values were initially estimated by means of Guinier analysis (Guinier and Fournet, 1955) with the program PRIMUS (Konarev et al., 2003). The programs GNOM and GIFT (Bergmann et al., 2000) were used to calculate indirect Fourier transforms of I(q) to give P(r) vs. r and associated values for I(0), Rg, and maximum dimension (Dmax). The molecular weights of the scattering particles in solution\u20143Cpro, SLD, and 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex\u2014were determined through Glatter\u2019s method and the equation (Orthaber et al., 2000):(1)MW=[I(0).NA]/[c.\u0394\u03c1M2]where N\nA is Avogadro\u2019s number, c is the concentration of the scattering particle in g cm\u22123, and \u0394\u03c1M\n2 is the square of the scattering contrast per mass.

This program uses multiple scattering profiles to restore the shapes of complexes and differentiate between subunits possessing different scattering densities. In the present case, a strong contrast occurs between SLD and 3Cpro due to the electron-dense phosphate backbone of the RNA. Input data for each MONSA calculation included both of the smoothed, desmeared I(q) profiles generated from GNOM for the 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex and 3Cpro. The Rg constraints in these calculations were derived from the SAXS data for 3Cpro and the 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex. As SLD alone showed a tendency to dimerize under these experimental conditions, we used a theoretical Rg constraint for that component calculated from the coordinates of the SLD NMR structure (Headey et al., 2006). The results of 10 independent MONSA calculations were averaged and evaluated with the program DAMAVER (Volkov and Svergun, 2003) to generate a consensus envelope for the entire complex and identify the relative positions of its protein and RNA subunits. The mean normalized spatial discrepancy between corresponding subunits in each model was 0.45 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 for 3Cpro and SLD, respectively, indicating that all restored shape solutions were very similar.",

These SLD structures differ primarily in the details of the triloop conformation. Ten independent calculations were performed for each combination of 3Cpro and one of the SLD structures. The SLD component was constrained to have at least one nucleotide within 10 \u00c5 of the C\u03b1 atom of the 3Cpro residues strongly implicated in RNA-binding by at least two of the following criteria: mutagenesis, NMR chemical shift perturbation, NMR signal loss, or signal doubling. This distance constraint was set to 20 \u00c5 for more moderately implicated residues to allow for the possibility that residues not directly in contact with the binding interface region may be affected by binding, but typically to a lesser extent. The best model was selected based on the fit to the scattering data as determined by the minimum \u03c7\n2 value, which for an ideal fit is 1.0.

Spectral quality was improved by inclusion of the active site inhibitor JMC-98-3 (Webber et al., 1998). A structural model of the protein plus JMC-98-3 inhibitor, designated 3CI, was constructed based on homology modelling using the HRV-14 3Cpro solution structure (PDB: 2B0F) (Bjorndahl et al., 2007) with the JMC-98-3 inhibitor modelled into the active site. The resulting structure was refined using NH residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data. The 3Cpro consists of 182 residues and a total of 156 backbone amide peaks were assigned in the 3CI spectrum. In addition to the six prolines, twenty residues did not produce identifiable backbone amide peaks. However, the unassigned residues are sequentially isolated with the exception of the 103\u2013112 loop that is adjacent to the proteolytic active site and is not implicated in RNA-binding (Matthews et al., 1994). Thus, the assigned peaks provide a suitable sampling of the potential interactions with RNA.",

Loops of varying lengths separate the strands. The most extensive interstrand interval occurs between strands 6 and 7 and includes residues T76 through to V97. This lengthy loop is situated along the face opposite to the proteolytic active site, contains a short \u03b1-helix, and serves as a linker between the N-terminal and C-terminal \u03b2-barrel domains (Fig. 1, linker in yellow).",

Residues I86 and R87, which complete the KFRDIR motif but are partially buried along the back side of the small yellow helix in Fig. 1A, show little change on binding.",

The small-angle X-ray scattering from the 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex is therefore sensitive to the positions and orientations of RNA and protein components. Scattering data were acquired for the 3Cpro, SLD and the 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex (Fig. 6\n). These data yield basic parameters such as molecular weight, radius of gyration (Rg), and the contrast-weighted distribution of interatomic distances (P(r)) within the scattering particle (Supplementary Table 1). The experimentally determined molecular weights for 3Cpro and 3Cpro\u2013SLD, as well as a lysozyme standard (calculated from measured I(0) values with equation (1)) agree well with the expected values based on amino acid and nucleotide sequences. The experimental Rg value for 3Cpro derived from its P(r) agrees with the theoretical value from the NMR structure (16.7 \u00c5, calculated using the program CRYSOL (Svergun and Nierhaus, 2000)). In contrast, the SLD molecular weight determined from I(0) was approximately twice the expected value indicating that under our experimental conditions SLD is not a monomer in solution. Nonetheless, a 1:1 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex of the expected molecular weight was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of 3Cpro to SLD (Supplementary Table 1), which is consistent with the NMR results.",

First, the molecular envelope for the 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex was generated through ab initio shape restoration. As the protein and RNA components of the complex have different contrasts this enables the determination of the relative position of 3Cpro and SLD within the total molecular envelope. The envelope is shown as a transparent surface in Fig. 7\nA and fits the scattering data with a statistically ideal \u03c7\n2 value of 1.00 (Fig. 6B). This envelope has dimensions of approximately 80 \u00c5 \u00d7 50 \u00c5 \u00d7 50 \u00c5 with the SLD component extending away from the surface of the 3Cpro at an angle of \u223c30\u00b0. Independent from ab initio shape restoration, an atomic model for the complex was calculated from the NMR-derived structures for 3Cpro and SLD through rigid-body refinement. These rigid-body calculations were combined with previously derived NMR contact information to constrain the relative orientations between the subunits. The atomic model of the complex is shown as ribbons in Fig. 7A and fits the scattering data with a \u03c7\n2 value of 1.26, which is good but somewhat higher than ideal. This discrepancy may be the result of small differences between the actual conformation of SLD and/or 3Cpro in the complex compared with the corresponding structures used for the calculation, which were derived for each component in isolation. Indeed, the predicted scattering profile for the 3Cpro component of the complex fits the scattering data for uncomplexed 3Cpro relatively poorly (\u03c7\n2\n = 1.44), and provides further evidence that the 3Cpro undergoes a small conformational change upon forming a complex with SLD.",

            "text": "RNA\u2013protein interactions are by their very nature diverse due to the variety of secondary and tertiary structures that each of these biopolymers is capable of adopting. The 3Cpro tertiary structure does not appear to fit neatly into one of the previously defined classes of RNA-binding domains. However, some commonalities are apparent. For instance, we have shown that the linker connecting the two \u03b2-barrel domains of 3Cpro, which lacks regular secondary structure and is likely to possess some degree of mobility, is a key to the interaction with SLD. Proteins containing the most prolific RNA-binding domain, dubbed simply the RNA-binding domain (RBD) or RNA recognition motif (RRM), often use the flexible linker between tandem RBDs to contact a flexible region of RNA (Allain et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2001). After complex formation, each of these flexible regions changes conformation, typically becoming more highly ordered (Bouvet et al., 2001). This raises the possibility that a conformational change and an increase in rigidity may occur in the 3Cpro linker and SLD triloop. This potential rearrangement could, among other effects, help translocate the F89 aromatic ring of the connecting linker into closer contact with SLD. In addition, RBD domains possess two or three solvent-exposed aromatic bases which can form contacts with the RNA bases (Birney et al., 1993). This is consistent with the potential involvement of the exposed F83, F89 and F6 residues from 3Cpro, although the effects at F6 may simply be due to an overall shift in the position of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix. Precedence here comes from the U1A\u2013UTR complex (Oubridge et al., 1995, Varani et al., 2000), in which the U1A C-terminal \u03b1-helix shifts position to allow the RNA UTR fragment more complete access to the RNA-binding sheet beneath.",

Ideal A-form RNA contains a deep and narrow major groove which precludes the possibility of specific recognition of the base pairs within. The minor groove side provides greater access, but the bases present an essentially uniform, non-sequence-specific face in the minor groove. Specific recognition of bases must occur via the major groove. RNA stem loops containing non-canonical base pairs can present a widened major groove, as has been shown for HRV-14 SLD (Headey et al., 2006) and in other instances (Du et al., 2004, Ohlenschl\u00e4ger et al., 2004). Thus, contacts between the stem region closest to the triloop and the protease may benefit from the presence of the non-canonical base pairs further up the stem. The contacts between the triloop bases and 3Cpro are somewhat analogous to the binding of the sex-lethal protein to a non-paired uracil-rich tract from the drosophila transformer mRNA precursor (Handa et al., 1999). The transformer uracil-rich tract is extended but ordered, including stable sugar puckers in the atypical C2\u2032-endo configuration. Thus it is interesting to note that each sugar of the uracil-rich stretch of implicated SLD nucleotides (uracil-13 to uracil-17) primarily adopts a C2\u2032-endo configuration (Headey et al., 2006). In summary, while the global fold of 3Cpro may be distinct from other RNA-binding proteins investigated to date, the mechanisms of interaction may be largely conserved.",

            "text": "SLD stem I is highly conserved among rhinoviruses. Mutational work in which stem I adenine \u00b7 uracil pairs were replaced with guanine \u00b7 cytosine pairs suggests that this conservation is necessary to retain the ability to bind 3Cpro (Walker et al., 1995). This would seem at odds with the model (Fig. 7A), in which the triloop and stem II regions contact 3Cpro. On the other hand, NMR shift perturbation data for a coxsackie virus 3Cpro\u2013SLD interaction (Ohlenschl\u00e4ger et al., 2004) suggest that the triloop and the nearby stem II elements contact the protein (Fig. 7B). Although 3Cpro from HRV-14 can bind SLD from other picornaviral species, the opposite is not necessarily true. For example, coxsackie virus 3Cpro is unable to bind HRV-14 SLD. Evidence suggests that this disparity is due to the presence of a triloop in HRV-14 SLD vs. a tetraloop in most other picornaviral SLD (Zell et al., 2002). These results implicate the triloop region in binding. The somewhat contradictory data regarding stem I could suggest that alterations close to the chain termini influence the global fold or stability of SLD, affecting the binding at the triloop end. That is, shape, rather than contact recognition of the specific bases in stem I, may be the key determining factor (e.g. Rieder et al., 2003, Zell et al., 2002). Sequence conservation in stem I could also reflect, to some degree, other interactions/activities that are not well characterized at present.",

This includes chemical shift changes in T143, loss of peaks for F25 and G144 and intensity reduction in H40, Q42, E71 and S127. It thus appears that the signal of SLD binding to the linker side of 3Cpro is transduced into a change at the active site. This could represent a mode of regulation, fine-tuning the specificity or activity of 3Cpro as previously suggested (Peters et al., 2004, Shih et al., 2004). The mechanism of this transmission may involve the hydrophobic core of the protein.

Perturbation of this loop appears to occur via direct interactions with the RNA triloop through the 79\u201384 loop, or in a supporting role for this loop. The 151\u2013156 loop is partially conserved at the G154 (50%) and K155 (70%) positions and contains 100% hydrophobic residues at the 156 and 157 positions. Changes induced in this loop may be more indirect in nature, as SLD does not closely approach these residues in the present model. In 3CI, T153 and G154 interact with F6 (90% hydrophobic) of the N-terminal helix and are within \u223c4 \u00c5 of F89 of the opposing FISEDLE motif from the C-terminal half of the linker. K155 closely approaches the acidic residues in the FISEDLE loop. Thus the 151\u2013156 loop is positioned between two important structural elements, the N-terminal \u03b1-helix and the inter-domain linker. Both of these elements directly contact the RNA. Changes induced in these elements could result in the observed (indirect) perturbation of the 151\u2013156 loop.

Strands 2 and 3 extensively hydrogen bond to each other, as do strands 10 and 11 up to the point where the longer strand 11 curves toward the protein periphery. Therefore the induced change is more likely to involve a slight reorientation of the 2\u20133 pair relative to the 10\u201311 pair than changes within each pair. The 2\u20133 to 10\u201311 contact is in fact the point of junction between the N-terminal and C-terminal \u03b2-barrel. Together with the intimate involvement of the 76\u201397 linker that covalently joins the two barrels, it would appear that 3Cpro\u2013SLD complex formation may induce a subtle change in the relative positions of the two 3Cpro \u03b2-barrels that transmits RNA-binding information to the opposite, catalytic face of the protease.

The position of the oriI site is highly variable. For example, in poliovirus the oriI element is within the 2C coding sequence (Goodfellow et al., 2000) and in HRV-14 it is located in the VP1 (capsid protein) coding sequence (McKnight and Lemon, 1996, McKnight and Lemon, 1998). The oriI interaction leads to uridylation of the 3B protein (also known as VPg) with the resulting uridylated peptide serving as a primer for viral RNA replication. In the context of the 3C/VPg/oriI complex, a binding mechanism has been proposed that includes a 3C dimerization event (Pathak et al., 2007, Pathak et al., 2008, Shen et al., 2008), supported by cross-linking studies and crystal contacts of uncomplexed poliovirus 3Cpro (Mosimann et al., 1997) though a previous study found no evidence of dimerization (Xiang et al., 1998). NMR data from 3Cpro interactions with single-stranded 11-mer RNA sequences derived from the poliovirus oriI element (Amero et al., 2008) were combined with the above theory to propose that a poliovirus 3Cpro dimer binds to two sites on an unwound oriI element.",

Furthermore, although the bases of the SLD triloop region are unpaired, we see no evidence of significant disruption of base-pairing in the HRV-14 SLD stem regions upon complex formation. These discrepancies with previous models may reflect differences in 3Cpro interactions with oriI vs. oriL or perhaps differences between poliovirus and HRV replication mechanisms. While overlapping regions of the 3Cpro surface from poliovirus and HRV are clearly involved in interaction with single-stranded oligomers derived from the poliovirus oriI element and with the intact HRV-14 oriL, respectively, the mode of interaction may thus differ in other aspects. Along these lines, note that substitution of the poliovirus oriI element into HRV yields a chimera unable to uridylate VPg (Shen et al., 2007). Note also that the 3Cpro N-terminal \u03b1-helix amide chemical shifts were assigned in the poliovirus 3Cpro-oriI study, suggesting that the characteristics or role of the N-terminal helix may differ in poliovirus vs. HRV-14 or in binding single vs. double-stranded RNA molecules. Each of these possibilities would be consistent with the suggestion that the HRV-14 N-terminal helix may interact directly with the SLD stem region. Furthermore, a recent crystallographic study of the 3Cpro\u20133Dpol fusion protein from poliovirus (Marcotte et al., 2007) positions the covalently linked 3Dpol in close contact with the C\u2013terminal region of 3Cpro. This orientation of 3Dpol, if conserved in HRV-14, would not interfere with the SLD\u20133Cpro contacts as determined in the present study. The 3Dpol position does, however, conflict with the poliovirus 3Cpro dimer contacts used in the previous models. It is possible that either the 3Cpro\u20133Cpro or 3Cpro\u20133Dpol contacts differ in vivo vs. in a crystal environment, or that poliovirus 3Cpro dimerizes in this fashion only after proteolytic release of 3Dpol. Further structural studies of 3Cpro\u20133Dpol in complex with SLD and with larger fragments of the 5\u2032-UTR or oriI elements, along with quantitative analyses of RNA-induced effects on 3Cpro catalytic activity, will help to further delineate the molecular mechanism of genomic replication in picornaviruses and perhaps shed light on the intricate mechanisms linking replication events.",

The positions of catalytic triad residues H40, E71 and C146 are marked by \u25cf. Sites of mutations shown to inhibit RNA-binding (Andino et al., 1993, Leong et al., 1993) are marked by \u2022.

Positive and negative values indicate \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet character, respectively. Gaps indicate positions of unassigned residues. (B) 3CIR CSI data. (C) Difference between B and A. Residues that are unassigned in the 3CI and/or 3CIR complex are designated as zero value. For residues that produce multiple peaks, the chemical shift of the most intense peak was used. Solid and dashed horizontal lines denote zero \u00b1 one standard deviation. (D) Chemical shift perturbation of 3CI upon titration of SLD, shown as a normalized sum of backbone chemical shifts.
