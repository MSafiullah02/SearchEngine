Burn centers gearing for the pandemic must strike a balance between contributing to the pandemic response and preserving ongoing burn care in a safe and ethical fashion. The authors of the present communication represent seven burn centers from China, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Each center is located at a different point along the pandemic curve and serves different patient populations within their healthcare systems. We review our experience with the virus to date, our strategic approach to burn center function under these circumstances, and lessons learned. The purpose of this communication is to share experiences that will assist with continued preparations to help burn centers advocate for optimum burn care and overcome challenges as this pandemic continues.",

Like a slow-motion 34 car accident, we have all contemplated what coming weeks 35 will bring to our communities. 36 Reports have taught us that the disease brings high 37 volumes of critically ill patients in a surge that can be 38 overwhelming. The lines of defense for the critically ill start 39 with the medical intensive care units, followed by the surgical 40 intensive care units, leaving the burn intensive care units 41 shielded at first. 42 But the burn service as a whole is a working unit of great 43 resilience able to handle the arduous care of the sickest 44 patients with the largest and most complex wounds. As a 45 result, the burn service represents an important component of 46 the response to the COVID-19 surge, as has been demonstrated 47 repeatedly. 48 As burn leaders anticipate the surge in their own cities in 49 coming weeks, the strategic approach will vary depending on 50 numerous local factors. As the following reports demonstrate, 51 key tasks include strategic coordination of services, reasoned 52 allocation of burn resources to the surge, and maintenance of 53 residual burn capacity.

University of Iowa burn service planning 705 10.4.1. Adaptation in communication 706 The burn unit, in many regards, was well positioned to adjust to 707 the new guidelines. Already with a well-functioning interdisci-708 plinary team, the burn team was able to adjust to electronic 709 communication platforms for rounds and communication. 710 Telemedicine was already an active way to communicate with 711 both clinic and outside referral hospitals. For clinic stream-712 lining, the team was able to effectively communicate via phone 713 and the patient web portal. For referral hospitals, an optional 714 picture upload to a privacy-protected email was made manda-715 tory (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996). 716 Per protocol charge nurses were able to continue to manage 717 potential transfers with house officer or advanced practice 718 provider input when necessary.719 10.4.2.

Discharged patients were instructed 722 on future wound care per the discharging nurse and videos 723 that had been previously created. Finally, our disaster 724 preparedness dressing supply list was reviewed with the 725 hospital to ensure that we had enough supplies and did not 726 have to adjust our daily routines.727 10.4.3. Changes in burn care algorithm 728 Projections of the coming surge of critically ill COVID-729 19 patients in the state of Iowa suggest we will face shortages 730 in ventilators and ICU capacity in two weeks. Our present 731 stance is aimed to conserve resources as much as possible. Key lessons from centers at the tail end of the epidemic 736 surge 737 Chongqing and Shanghai are cities of the largest scale, positioned 738 relatively close to Hubei and are now well past the main surge of 739 infections. The most important lessons from their experience are 740 on the subject of big picture coordination and discipline in 741 prevention. Their remarkable success in containment should 742 motivate other centers to carefully study their approach. 743 Both cities had a centralized command structure for the 744 response to the virus which was able to direct the population 745 and coordinate city-wide clinical strategy. 746 Even though COVID-positive patients were kept out of the 747 burn service, both burn centers maintained intense and 748 meticulous precautions with great discipline. Consequently, 749 neither of these exceptionally large burn centers had a single 750 case of a COVID positive patient in their main units, preserving 751 burn center function. And importantly, burn patients who 752 were COVID-positive were successfully managed as part of the 753 COVID-positive cohort. 754 11.2. Key lessons from centers currently in the middle of the 755 surge 756 Barcelona is a large city with an advanced healthcare system. 757 And yet the surge of life-threatening COVID-19 has forced the city 758 to engage in a heroic defensive action. A key lesson to be learned 759 is that the COVID-19 surge can reach a scale and intensity that 760 few of us have ever experienced. As the surge intensifies, a 761 continuous reallocation of healthcare resources may be required. 762 This is a challenging task that should be vigorously planned now. 763 Likewise, burn center resources will be increasingly directed to 764 the COVID-19 response. This will result in a de facto austere 765 situation vis-\u00e0-vis burns. Hence austere condition burn algo-766 rithms should be titrated as the scale of the COVID-19 threat rises. 767 11.3.
