According to our perception, the economic challenges we are currently facing can only be mastered by large-scale, multi-disciplinary efforts and by innovative approaches [6] . We fully recognize the large variety of non-mainstream approaches that has been developed by \"heterodox economists\". However, the research traditions in economics seem to be so powerful that these are not paid much attention to. Besides, there is no agreement on which of the alternative modeling approaches would be the most promising ones, i.e. the heterogeneity of alternatives is one of the problems, which slows down their success. This situation clearly implies institutional challenges as well, but these go beyond the scope of this contribution and will therefore be addressed in the future.",

This may result from misjudgements or from herding effects, i.e. from a tendency to follow traditions and majority opinions. In fact, most of the issues discussed below have been pointed out before, but it seems that this did not have an effect on mainstream economics so far or on what decision-makers know about economics. This is probably because mainstream theory has become a norm [8] , and alternative approaches are sanctioned as norm-deviant behavior [9, 10] .",

It assumes that people would have quasi-infinite memory and processing capacities and would determine the best one among all possible alternative behaviors by strategic thinking (systematic utility optimization), and would implement it into practice without mistakes. The Nobel prize winner of 1976, Milton Friedman, supported the hypothesis of homo economicus by the following argument: \"irrational agents will lose money and will be driven out of the market by rational agents\" [11] . More recently, Robert E. Lucas Jr., the Nobel prize winner of 1995, used the rationality hypothesis to narrow down the class of empirically relevant equilibria [12] . The rational agent hypothesis is very charming, as its implications are clear and it is possible to derive beautiful and powerful economic theorems and theories from it. The best way to illustrate homo economicus is maybe a company that is run by using optimization methods from operation research, applying supercomputers. Another example are professional chess players, who are trying to anticipate the possible future moves of their opponents. Obviously, in both examples, the future course of actions can not be fully predicted, even if there are no random effects and mistakes.",

Also, the abilities to memorize facts and to perform complicated logical analyses are clearly limited. 2. In case of NP-hard optimization problems, even supercomputers are facing limits, i.e. optimization jobs cannot be performed in real-time anymore. Therefore, approximations or simplifications such as the application of heuristics may be necessary. In fact, psychologists have identified a number of heuristics, which people use when making decisions [18] . 3. People perform strategic thinking mainly in important new situations. In normal, everyday situation, however, they seem to pursue a satisficing rather than optimizing strategy [17] . Meeting a certain aspiration level rather than finding the optimal strategy can save time and energy spent on problem solving. In many situation, people even seem to perform routine choices [14] , for example, when evading other pedestrians in counterflows. 4. There is a long list of cognitive biases which question rational behavior [19] . For example, individuals are favorable of taking small risks (which are preceived as \"chances\", as the participation in lotteries shows), but they avoid large risks [20] . Furthermore, non-exponential temporal discounting may lead to paradoxical behaviors [21] and requires one to rethink, how future expectations must be modeled. 5. Most individuals have a tendency towards other-regarding behavior and fairness [22, 23] . For example, the dictator game [24] and other experiments [25] show that people tend to share, even if there is no reason for this. Leaving a tip for the waiter in a restaurant that people visit only once is a typical example (particularly in countries where tipping is not common) [26] . Such behavior has often been interpreted as sign of social norms. While social norms can certainly change the payoff structure, it has been found that the overall payoffs resulting from them do not need to create a user or system optimum [27] [28] [29] . This suggests that behavioral choices may be irrational in the sense of non-optimal. A typical example is the existence of unfavorable norms, which are supported by people although nobody likes them [30] . 6. Certain optimization problems can have an infinite number of local optima or Nash equilibria, which makes it impossible to decide what is the best strategy [31] . 7. Convergence towards the optimal solution may require such a huge amount of time that the folk theorem becomes useless. This can make it practically impossible to play the best response strategy [32] .",

Even if an optimal solution exists, it may be undecidable for practical reasons or for theoretical ones [35, 36] .

For this reason, Adam Smith is often considered to be the father of free market economics. Curiously enough, however, he also wrote a book on \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" [40] . \"His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man's natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior . . . [and] seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them\" [38] .

While the concept of the \"invisible hand\" assumes something like an optimal self-organization [44] , it is well-known that this requires certain conditions, such as symmetrical interactions. In general, however, self-organization does not necessarily imply system-optimal solutions. Stop-and-go traffic [45] or crowd disasters [46] are two obvious examples for systems, in which individuals competitively try to reach individually optimal outcomes, but where the optimal solution is dynamically unstable. 3. The limited processing capacity of boundedly rational individuals implies potential delays in their responses to sensorial inputs, which can cause such instabilities [47] . For example, a delayed adaptation in production systems may contribute to the occurrence of business cycles [48] . The same applies to the labor market of specially skilled people, which cannot adjust on short time scales. Even without delayed reactions, however, the competitive optimization of individuals can lead to suboptimal individual results, as the \"tragedy of the commons\" in public goods dilemmas demonstrates [49, 50] . 4. Bubbles and crashes, or more generally, extreme events in financial markets should not occur, if the efficient market hypothesis was correct (see next subsection). 5. Collective social behavior such as \"herding effects\" as well as deviations of human behavior from what is expected from rational agents can lead to such bubbles and crashes [51] , or can further increase their size through feedback effects [52] . Cyclical feedbacks leading to oscillations are also known from the beer game [53] or from business cycles [48] .",

Theoretically, it is not obvious that such a system would have a stationary solution. For example, the system could behave periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, or turbulent [81-83, 85-87, 94] . In all these cases, there would be no convergence to a stationary solution. 2. If a stationary solution exists, it is not clear that there are no further stationary solutions. If many variables are non-linearly coupled, the phenomenon of multistability can easily occur [55] . That is, the solution to which the system converges may not only depend on the model parameters, but also on the initial condition, history, or perturbation size. Such facts are known as path-dependencies or hysteresis effects and are usually visualized by so-called phase diagrams [56] . 3. In systems of non-linearly interacting variables, the existence of a stationary solution does not necessarily imply that it is stable, i.e. that the system will converge to this solution. For example, the stationary solution could be a focal point with orbiting solutions (as for the classical Lotka-Volterra equations [57] ), or it could be unstable and give rise to a limit cycle [58] or a chaotic solution [33] , for example (see also item 1). In fact, experimental results suggest that volatility clusters in financial markets may be a result of over-reactions to deviations from the fundamental value [59] . 4. An infinite relaxation rate is rather unusual, as most decisions and related implemenations take time [15, 60] .",

In July 2005 when asked about the possibility of a housing bubble and the potential for this to lead to a recession in the future, the present U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke (then Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors) said: \"It's a pretty unlikely possibility. We've never had a decline in housing prices on a nationwide basis. So, what I think is more likely is that house prices will slow, maybe stabilize, might slow consumption spending a bit. I don't think it's going to drive the economy too far from it's full path though.\" As late as May 2007 Bernanke stated that the Federal Reserve \"do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy\".",

Such a linear stability analysis allows one to study, whether the system will return to the stationary solution (which is the case for a stable [Nash] equilibrium) or not (which implies that the system will eventually be driven into a new state or regime). In fact, the great majority of statistical analyses use linear models to fit empirical data (also when they do not involve time-dependencies).

            "text": "1. As it was mentioned before, phenomena like multiple equilibria, chaos or turbulence cannot be understood by linear models. The same is true for selforganization phenomena or emergence. Additionally, in non-linearly coupled systems, usually \"more is different\", i.e. the system may change its behavior fundamentally as it grows beyond a certain size. Furthermore, the system is often hard to predict and difficult to control (see Sect. 16.3.8). 2. Linear modeling tends to overlook that a strong coupling of variables, which would show a normally distributed behavior in separation, often leads to fat tail distributions (such as \"power laws\") [70, 71] . This implies that extreme events are much more frequent than expected according to a Gaussian distribution. For example, when additive noise is replaced by multiplicative noise, a number of surprising phenomena may result, including noise-induced transitions [72] or directed random walks (\"ratchet effects\") [73] . 3. Phenomena such as catastrophes [74] or phase transition (\"system shifts\") [75] cannot be well understood within a linear modeling framework. The same applies to the phenomenon of \"self-organized criticality\" [79] (where the system drives itself to a critical state, typically with power-law characteristics) or cascading effects, which can result from network interactions (overcritically challenged network nodes or links) [77, 78] . It should be added that the relevance of network effects resulting from the on-going globalization is often underestimated. For example, \"the stock market crash of 1987, began with a small drop in prices which triggered an avalanche of sell orders in computerized trading programs, causing a further price decline that triggered more automatic sales.\" [80] Therefore, while linear models have the advantage of being analytically solvable, they are often unrealistic. Studying non-linear behavior, in contrast, often requires numerical computational approaches. It is likely that most of today's unsolved economic puzzles cannot be well understood through linear models, no matter how complicated they may be (in terms of the number of variables and parameters) [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] .

Within this framework, time-dependencies and non-linear dependencies are often considered, but it is assumed that the interaction with other agents (e.g. of one company with all the other companies) can be treated as if this agent would interact with an average agent, the \"representative agent\". Let us illustrate this with the example of the public goods dilemma. Here, everyone can decide whether to make an individual contribution to the public good or not. The sum of all contributions is multiplied by a synergy factor, reflecting the benefit of cooperation, and the resulting value is equally shared among all people. The prediction of the representative agent approach is that, due to the selfishness of agents, a \"tragedy of the commons\" would result [49] . According to this, everybody should free-ride, i.e. nobody should make a contribution to the public good and nobody would gain anything. However, if everybody would contribute, everybody could multiply his or her contribution by the synergy factor. This example is particularly relevant as society is facing a lot of public goods problems and would not work without cooperation. Everything from the creation of public infrastructures (streets, theaters, universities, libraries, schools, the World Wide Web, Wikipedia etc.) over the use of environmental resources (water, forests, air, etc.) or of social benefit systems (such as a public health insurance), maybe even the creation and maintainance of a commonly shared language and culture are public goods problems (although the last examples are often viewed as coordination problems). Even the process of creating public goods is a public good [95] .",

In economics, one tries to solve the problem by introducing taxes (i.e. another incentive structure) or a \"shadow of the future\" (i.e. a strategic optimization over infinite time horizons in accordance with the rational agent approach) [96, 97] . Both comes down to changing the payoff structure in a way that transforms the public good problem into another one that does not constitute a social dilemma [98] . However, there are other solutions of the problem. When the realm of the mean-field approximation underlying the representative agent approach is left and spatial or network interactions or the heterogeneity among agents are considered, a miracle occurs: Cooperation can survive or even thrive through correlations and co-evolutionary effects [99] [100] [101] .",

Partially related to Adam Smith's belief in an \"invisible hand\", one often assumes underlying coordination games and that they would automatically create a harmony between an individually and system optimal state in the course of time [54] . However, running a stable financial system and economy is most likely a public goods problem. Considering unemployment, recessions always go along with a breakdown of solidarity and cooperation. Efficient production clearly requires mutual cooperation (as the counter-example of countries with many strikes illustrates). The failure of the interbank market when banks stop lending to each other, is a good example for the breakdown of both, trust and cooperation. We must be aware that there are many other systems that would not work anymore, if people would lose their trust: electronic banking, e-mail and internet use, Facebook, eBusiness and eGovernance, for example. Money itself would not work without trust, as bank panics and hyperinflation scenarios show. Similarly, cheating customers by selling low-quality products or selling products at overrated prices, or by manipulating their choices by advertisements rather than informing them objectively and when they want, may create profits on the short run, but it affects the trust of customers (and their willingness to invest). The failure of the immunization campaign during the swine flu pandemics may serve as an example. Furthermore, people would probably spend more money, if the products of competing companies were better compatible with each other. Therefore, on the long run, more cooperation among companies and with the customers would pay off and create additional value.",

Well-mixed interactions could rather cause a breakdown of social or economic institutions, and it is conceivable that this played a role in the recent financial crisis.) 2. Percolation phenomena, describing how far an idea, innovation, technology, or (computer) virus spreads through a social or business network, are not well reproduced, as they depend on details of the network structure, not just on the average node degree [103] . 3. The heterogeneity of agents is ignored. For this reason, factors underlying economic exchange, perturbations, or systemic robustness [104] cannot be well described. Moreover, as socio-economic differentiation and specialization imply heterogeneity, they cannot be understood as emergent phenomena within a representative agent approach. Finally, it is not possible to grasp innovation without the consideration of variability. In fact, according to evolutionary theory, the innovation rate would be zero, if the variability was zero [105] . Furthermore, in order to explain innovation in modern societies, Schumpeter introduced the concept of the \"political entrepreneur\" [106] , an extra-ordinarily gifted person capable of creating disruptive change and innovation.

In principle, it should be understandable how the macroeconomic dynamics results from the microscopic decisions and interactions on the level of producers and consumers [81, 110] (as it was possible in the past to derive micro-macro links for other systems with a complex dynamical behavior such as interactive vehicle traffic [111] ). It should also be comprehensible how the macroscopic level (the aggregate econonomic situation) feeds back on the microscopic level (the behavior of consumers and producers), and to understand the economy as a complex, adaptive, self-organizing system [112, 113] . Concepts from evolutionary theory [114] and ecology [115] appear to be particularly promising [116] .

            "text": "High profit? Best customer satisfaction? Large throughput? Competitive advantage? Resilience? [122] In fact, the choice of the optimization function is arbitrary to a certain extent and, therefore, the result of optimization may vary largely. Goal selection requires strategic decisions, which may involve normative or moral factors (as in politics). In fact, one can often observe that, in the course of time, different goal functions are chosen. Moreover, note that the maximization of certain objectives such as resilience or \"fitness\" depends not only on factors that are under the control of a company. Resilience and \"fitness\" are functions of the whole system, in particularly, they also depend on the competitors and the strategies chosen by them. 3. The best solution may be the combination of two bad solutions and may, therefore, be overlooked. In other words, there are \"evolutionary dead ends\", so that gradual optimization may not work. (This problem can be partially overcome by the application of evolutionary mechanisms [120] ). 4. In certain systems (such as many transport, logistic, or production systems), optimization tends to drive the system towards instability, since the point of maximum efficiency is often in the neighborhood or even identical with the point of breakdown of performance. Such breakdowns in capacity or performance can result from inefficiencies due to dynamic interaction effects. For example, when traffic flow reaches its maximum capacity, sooner or later it breaks down. As a consequence, the road capacity tends to drop during the time period where it is most urgently needed, namely during the rush hour [45, 123] . 5 . Optimization often eliminates reduncancies in the system and, thereby, increases the vulnerability to perturbations, i.e. it decreases robustness and resilience. 6. Optimization tends to eliminate heterogeneity in the system [80] , while heterogeneity frequently supports adaptability and resilience. 7. Optimization is often performed with centralized concepts (e.g. by using supercomputers that process information collected all over the system). Such centralized systems are vulnerable to disturbances or failures of the central control unit. They are also sensitive to information overload, wrong selection of control parameters, and delays in adaptive feedback control. In contrast, decentralized control (with a certain degree of autonomy of local control units) may perform better, when the system is complex and composed of many heterogeneous elements, when the optimization problem is NP hard, the degree of fluctuations is large, and predictability is restricted to short time periods [77, 124] . Under such conditions, decentralized control strategies can perform well by adaptation to the actual local conditions, while being robust to perturbations. Urban traffic light control is a good example for this [121, 125] . 8. Further on, today's concept of quality control appears to be awkward. It leads to a never-ending contest, requiring people and organizations to fulfil permanently increasing standards. This leads to over-emphasizing measured performance criteria, while non-measured success factors are neglected. The engagement into non-rewarded activities is discouraged, and innovation may be suppressed (e.g. when evaluating scientists by means of their h-index, which requires them to focus on a big research field that generates many citations in a short time). While so-called \"beauty contests\" are considered to produce the best results, they will eventually absorb more and more resources for this contest, while less and less time remains for the work that is actually to be performed, when the contest is won. Besides, a large number of competitors have to waste considerable resources for these contests which, of course, have to be paid by someone. In this way, private and public sectors (from physicians over hospitals, administrations, up to schools and universities) are aching under the evaluationrelated administrative load, while little time remains to perform the work that the corresponding experts have been trained for. It seems na\u00efve to believe that this would not waste resources. Rather than making use of individual strengths, which are highly heterogeneous, today's way of evaluating performance enforces a large degree of conformity.",

As estimates for past data are not necessarily indicative for the future, making predictions with interpolation approaches can be quite problematic (see also Sect. 16.3.3 for the challenge of time dependence).

While we have an information theory to determine the number of bits required to encode a message, we are lacking a theory, which would allow us to assess what kind of information is relevant or important, or what kind of information will change the social or economic world, or history. This may actually be largely dependent on the perception of pieces of information, and on normative or moral issues filtering or weighting information. Moreover, we lack theories describing what will happen in cases of coincidence or contradiction of several pieces of information. When pieces of information interact, this can change their interpretation and, thereby, the decisions and behaviors resulting from them.

A contribution of physics appears quite natural, in fact, not only because of its tradition in detecting and modeling regularities in large data sets [141] . Physics also has a lot of experience how to theoretically deal with problems such as time-dependence, fluctuations, friction, entropy, non-linearity, strong interactions, correlations, heterogeneity, and many-particle simulations (which can be easily extended towards multi-agent simulations). In fact, physics has influenced economic modeling already in the past. Macroeconomic models, for example, were inspired by thermodynamics. More recent examples of relevant contributions by physicists concern models of self-organizing conventions [54] , of geographic agglomeration [65] , of innovation spreading [142] , or of financial markets [143] , to mention just a few examples.",

Many econophysics solutions are interesting, but so far they are not broad and mighty enough to replace the rational agent paradigm with its large body of implications and applications. Nevertheless, considering the relatively small number of econophysicists, there have been many promising results. The probably largest fraction of publications in econophysics in the last years had a data-driven or computer modeling approach to financial markets [143] . But econophyics has more to offer than the analysis of financial data (such as fluctuations in stock and foreign currency exchange markets), the creation of interaction models for stock markets, or the development of risk management strategies. Other scientists have focused on statistical laws underlying income and wealth distributions, nonlinear market dynamics, macroeconomic production functions and conditions for economic growth or agglomeration, sustainable economic systems, business cycles, microeconomic interaction models, network models, the growth of companies, supply and production systems, logistic and transport networks, or innovation dynamics and diffusion.

Besides scepticism on the side of many economists with regard to novel approaches introduced by \"outsiders\", the limited resonance and level of interdisciplinary exchange in the past was also caused in part by econophysicists. In many cases, questions have been answered, which no economist asked, rather than addressing puzzles economists are interested in. Apart from this, the econophysics work was not always presented in a way that linked it to the traditions of economics and pointed out deficiencies of existing models, highlighting the relevance of the new approach well. Typical responses are: Why has this model been proposed and not another one? Why has this simplification been used (e.g. an Ising model of interacting spins rather than a rational agent model)? Why are existing models not good enough to describe the same facts? What is the relevance of the work compared to previous publications? What practical implications does the finding have? What kind of paradigm shift does the approach imply? Can existing models be modified or extended in a way that solves the problem without requiring a paradigm shift? Correspondingly, there have been criticisms not only by mainstream economists, but also by colleagues, who are open to new approaches [151] .",

It is important to demonstrate what properties of economic systems cannot be understood for fundamental reasons within the mainstream framework (i.e. cannot be dealt with by additional terms within the modeling class that is conventionally used). In other words, one needs to show why a paradigm shift is unavoidable, and this requires careful argumentation. We are not claiming that this has not been done in the past, but it certainly takes an additional effort to explain the essence of the econophysics approach in the language of economics, particularly as mainstream economics may not always provide suitable terms and frameworks to do this. This is particularly important, as the number of econophysicists is small compared to the number of economists, i.e. a minority wants to convince an established majority. To be taken seriously, one must also demonstrate a solid knowledge of related previous work of economists, to prevent the stereotypical reaction that the subject of the paper has been studied already long time ago (tacitly implying that it does not require another paper or model to address what has already been looked at before).",
