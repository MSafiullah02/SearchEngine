Absence of the external canal may occur with a deformed or normal external ear. The ossicles may be deformed and are usually fused to each other as well as the bony plate representing the undeveloped tympanic membrane. The facial nerve may also be altered in its course through the temporal bone. Reconstruction of the atretic canal, removal of the bony tympanic plate, release of the fused ossicles, and reconstruction of a new eardrum is a complex surgical procedure that may improve hearing. Rarely, there is incomplete development of the inner ear structures. The most common of these is dysplasia of the cochlea, and it may vary in severity. Dysplasia is associated with sensorineural hearing loss in most cases.3\n,\n4\n",

Insufflation of air into the ear canal via the pneumatic bulb should cause the tympanic membrane to move if the middle ear is normal (aerated) and fail to move if it is filled with effusion (mucus or pus). Cerumen may be encountered in the ear canal that obstructs the view of the tympanic membrane or fails to allow insufflation to occur with pneumatic otoscopy. Removal of cerumen may be performed by using an operating otoscope head and an ear curette. However, the use of a headlight, such as the Lumiview (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles, NY) or operating microscope, permits the use of both hands and superior visualization. Care should be taken to secure the child to prevent sudden movement, and the ear curette should be used gently to avoid causing pain and a laceration of the ear canal. A mechanical test of tympanic compliance (tympanometry) may also be useful to help determine if the middle ear is normally aerated (type A, peaked tracing), fluid-filled (type B, flat tracing), or has negative pressure because it is poorly ventilated, suggesting eustachian tube dysfunction (type C, negative pressure tracing). Examination of a child with an apparent or suspected ear condition often requires objective assessment of hearing by audiometry.

Older children are presented with a tone through insert earphones and are tested across a range of frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz for ear-specific testing. The hearing thresholds are recorded at each presented frequency, and this represents the air conduction threshold. The sound has to traverse the ear canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear. The inner ear must respond by creating electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain. Normal thresholds are less than 20 dB for children.",

A bone oscillator is used to test a range of frequencies by vibrating the skull, which stimulates the inner ear directly, bypassing the external and middle ear. Normally, air conduction thresholds require less energy than bone conduction thresholds. If bone conduction thresholds require less sound intensity to be heard than air conduction, the child has a conductive hearing loss. If air conduction and bone conduction thresholds are elevated but the same, the child has a sensorineural hearing loss. Most sensorineural hearing loss in children is a result of hair cell dysfunction in the organ of Corti. Hearing loss may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Objective electrophysical tests, such as brainstem auditory-evoked response and sound emission tests that measure the intrinsic sounds from the inner ear (otoacoustic emissions), may be used in young infants and children who cannot participate in behavioral audiometry. All of these tools are used by pediatric audiologists.5\n",

A hypopnea is variably described as a reduction in airflow or respiratory effort or oxygen desaturation or combination thereof. The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) is a measure of both apneas and hypopneas in an hour and may be a better reflection of SDB in children. An AHI greater than 5 is abnormal in adults, whereas, an AHI greater than 1.0 to 1.5 is abnormal in children. The upper airway resistance syndrome represents obstructed breathing with normal respiratory indices but with sleep fragmentation and electroencephalographic arousals that indicate disordered sleep.",

Their growth characteristics include enlargement during the first year of life, followed by spontaneous resolution. Surgical excision or treatment with corticosteroids may be necessary in lesions that cause ulceration and bleeding, airway obstruction, cardiovascular compromise, or platelet-trapping coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome). Longer-term systemic treatment with propranolol has recently been found to effectively reduce the size of symptomatic hemangiomas and may work by promoting vasoconstriction and downregulation of certain growth factors.27 Vascular malformations, including venous, arterial, or arteriovenous malformations, rarely occur in the oral cavity and pharynx and necessitate intervention only if they cause pain, bleeding, ulceration, or heart failure. Management of complicated cases is by surgical excision or sclerotherapy for low-flow lesions (venous) and angiographic embolization for high-flow lesions. Lymphatic malformation, formerly known as lymphangioma or cystic hygroma, is congenital and usually presents before 2 years of age. Histologically, lymphatic malformations consist of multiple dilated lymphatic channels or may contain either capillary or venous elements (venolymphatic malformations). Lymphatic malformations have been characterized as microcystic, macrocystic, or mixed based on their histologic patterns. Lymphatic malformations can occur anywhere in the neck and may cause extensive cosmetic deformity and functional problems in cases with involvement of the tongue, floor of mouth, mandible, or larynx. Deep and macrocystic disease may be controlled with aspiration and sclerotherapy performed by interventional radiologists, whereas treatment of microcystic or more superficial disease usually is surgical. Surgical resection of lymphatic malformations may be fraught with difficulty because they lack a capsule and are infiltrative. During surgical excision, care should be taken to avoid damaging nearby vital structures, and debulking is an acceptable option to total radical excision in many cases. Postoperative suction drains can be helpful in preventing the recurrence of lymphatic drainage under skin flaps. Coblation therapy and carbon dioxide laser therapy have been used in superficial lymphatic malformations of the tongue.",

The level of consciousness should be determined, because the unconscious or obtunded patient may need immediate airway management. Along with cyanosis in a patient without cyanotic heart disease, the presence of anxiety, restlessness, and diaphoresis are all ominous signs of impending airway compromise. Other symptoms of airway obstruction include tachypnea and substernal retractions. The child with airway obstruction is often tachycardic. The presence of bradycardia is a late indicator of severe hypoxia. The presence of a muffled cry often suggests obstruction at the level of the pharynx, whereas a barking cough is associated with laryngeal inflammation and edema. Stertor is a snorting sound whose origin is often in the pharynx. Stridor is noise produced by turbulent airflow in the laryngeal or tracheal airway. Inspiratory stridor suggests turbulence at or above the glottis. Expiratory stridor results from turbulent airflow in the distal trachea or bronchi. Biphasic stridor suggests a tracheal or subglottic source. A barking or croupy cough usually occurs when the subglottic trachea is involved. The degree and loudness of the sound is not always indicative of the severity of obstruction, because stridor can become softer just before complete obstruction. Other important signs of airway obstruction include drooling and use of accessory respiratory muscles.",

It can demonstrate findings of retropharyngeal or subglottic swelling from edema or infection and identify free air in the soft tissue spaces. The anteroposterior view of the neck is also helpful, specifically in defining areas of narrowing, such as a steeple sign associated with subglottic edema. A chest radiograph is also important in the initial assessment to identify foreign bodies or other conditions such as unilateral emphysema, atelectasis, or pneumonia that may account for the child's respiratory compromise.

Nasal airways of rubber or other synthetic material can be easily inserted into the nose of most children after adequate lubrication with a water-soluble lubricant. Their best use is in cases where the pharynx is the site of obstruction. Oral airways are not as readily tolerated by children and only serve as a brief solution to an airway problem. During the 1970s, endotracheal intubation with polyvinyl chloride tubes revolutionized the management of supraglottitis, and even today intubation remains the mainstay of initial airway therapy in most children with severe airway obstruction. The size of the endotracheal tube used correlates with the age of the child. The subglottis, the narrowest part of the infant airway, typically admits a 3.5- or 4.0-mm inner-diameter tube. The tube used in children older than 1 year can be roughly estimated by using the following formula: tube size = (age in years/4) + 4. Once the airway has been established, the tube should be carefully secured and the child appropriately sedated and/or restrained, if necessary, to avoid accidental self-extubation. Another method of airway management should be considered in children with an unstable cervical spine or in whom oral or neck trauma makes visualization difficult. Transtracheal ventilation, insertion of a 16-gauge needle through the cricothyroid membrane for the delivery of oxygen, should be reserved for emergencies and used only until a more stable airway can be obtained.",

As in adults, this procedure avoids some of the risks of bleeding and pneumothorax inherent in a formal emergency tracheostomy. A small endotracheal or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through the incision in the cricothyroid membrane, but conversion should be made to a more stable airway as soon as possible. Tracheostomy remains the preferred airway in cases of acute obstruction in which a translaryngeal approach is unsuccessful or must be avoided. The emergent tracheostomy should be avoided if at all possible to lessen complications of bleeding, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or damage to surrounding structures.

Congenital vocal fold paralysis may be caused by neurologic abnormalities (hydrocephalus, Arnold-Chiari malformation), birth trauma, or, rarely, in association with neoplasms of the larynx or neck. Acquired vocal fold paralysis may result from trauma or from neoplasms of the chest or neck, or it may be iatrogenic, typically after surgery of the neck, esophagus, or arch of the aorta. The risk of vocal cord paralysis is higher in premature babies who have surgery before they reach normal birth weights. Neonates with bilateral involvement typically present with high-pitched inspiratory or biphasic stridor but a good cry. Respiratory compromise and feeding difficulties may accompany the stridor because the vocal cords cannot abduct and the resultant airway is narrow. However, compensatory extralaryngeal muscles can help adduct the cords to produce a strong voice. In infants with unilateral involvement, the airway may be adequate because the affected vocal cord remains partly lateralized at rest. Unlike the case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis, the extralaryngeal muscles cannot cause the cord to adduct upon vocalization or during a swallow. As a result, these infants are at increased risk of aspiration and often have breathy, weak voices. The diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral vocal fold paralysis is confirmed with flexible or rigid endoscopy. Additional studies in the evaluation of patients with vocal fold paralysis include lateral neck and chest radiography, barium swallow, and CT or MRI of the head and neck. Most children with unilateral involvement can be observed. As they grow, they may be candidates for vocal cord medialization procedures, whereby, agents such as Gelfoam or Teflon are injected lateral to the cord to improve vocalization. Another treatment option is ansa cervicalis\u2013to\u2013recurrent laryngeal nerve anastomosis to reinnervate the affected cord. This increases the tone, bulk, and tension of the cord, but does not restore normal mobility.34 Infants with bilateral vocal fold paralysis often require a tracheostomy. In addition, infants with associated feeding difficulties may need a gastrostomy. In older children (4 or 5 years of age) with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, a more permanent solution, such as a cordotomy or arytenoidectomy, can be considered to improve the glottic airway and to allow for decannulation of the tracheotomy tube.",

A detailed history can often serve to focus the differential diagnosis of a neck disorder. The age of the child is an important first consideration. The appearance of a neck mass in an infant often suggests a congenital disorder, whereas the sudden appearance of a mass in an adolescent might suggest a malignant process. Inflammatory diseases of the neck may occur in any age group but typically mirror the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in children. Growth and temporal relationships are often important clues to a diagnosis. Neck masses that grow rapidly suggest either an inflammatory or malignant process, whereas slow-growing masses are typically benign. A history of systemic infection elsewhere in the body or recent travel or exposure to farm animals often points to an infectious origin. A history of trauma to the neck may explain the sudden appearance of a neck mass. Likewise, changes in the size of a neck mass with eating may suggest a salivary gland origin. Vascular lesions enlarge with straining or crying. Finally, systemic symptoms of fever, weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue in association with the sudden development of a neck mass may indicate a malignant process.",

            "text": "The physical examination of a child with a neck mass should begin with a comprehensive examination of the entire head and neck. Because the vascular, neural, and lymphatic patterns of the head drain into the neck, the source of neck disorders may be found in the head. Depending on the differential diagnosis, a physical examination of the entire body, including an assessment of lymph nodes in the groin and axillae and the presence of an enlarged spleen or liver, is essential. Palpable lymph nodes in the neck of children are a common finding, but lymph nodes larger than 2 cm fall outside the range of normal hyperplastic nodes and should be either monitored or investigated. The sudden appearance of large nodes in either the posterior cervical or supraclavicular regions may suggest a malignancy, especially if unilateral.37 The consistency of a neck mass is also important in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Hard masses tend to be associated with either infection or malignancy. Fixation of a neck mass to skin or nearby structures is also suggestive of a malignancy. Cysts or abscesses tend to have a characteristic feel on palpation and are usually ballotable, and the overlying skin may be inflamed if infected. Depending on the differential diagnosis after a history and physical examination, radiologic studies may be useful. A lateral neck radiograph may demonstrate an abnormality of the nasopharynx, retropharynx, or cervical spine. Likewise, a chest radiograph may identify a malignancy, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis. Infection or a neoplastic process in the sinuses may appear on a sinus series. CT and MRI are useful in the evaluation of a neck mass. Demonstration of hypodensity on CT suggests an inflammatory or necrotic process. Ring enhancement of a hypodense region on a contrast CT scan is indicative of an abscess. MRI is excellent for distinguishing fine detail within soft tissue and in the evaluation of vascular lesions of the neck. Finally, ultrasonography is helpful in distinguishing solid and cystic masses and may be the only imaging modality required in the assessment of neck masses. Use of ultrasonography preoperatively in patients with a thyroglossal duct cyst is also a simple and economic way to assess the presence of normal thyroid tissue when it is not easily felt. Ultrasonography should be used in the assessment of any thyroid mass, while thyroid scanning is now thought to be of limited value in the pediatric age group.",
