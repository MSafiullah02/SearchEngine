            "text": "\nCoronavirus is a genus of viruses in the family Coronaviridae under the order Nidovirales (1). The virus has a corona-like morphology and its genome contains a single segment of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity. Viruses under this genus have genome sizes ranging from 28 to 32 kb, which are the biggest among the RNA viruses. The genomic RNA of these viruses contains five major open reading frames (Orfs) that encode the replicase polyproteins (Orf 1a and Orf 1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in that order. Based on antigenic and genetic analysis, coronaviruses are traditionally classified into three groups. Coronaviruses from groups 1 and 2 have been found to infect mammals. By contrast, group 3 viruses are primarily avian viruses. Many coronaviruses are also pathogenic to their hosts (2). Animal coronaviruses can cause severe respiratory, enteric, neurological, or hepatic disease in their hosts. With the exception of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, all human coronaviruses are often only associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, virus surveillance studies over the last few years have identified many novel coronaviruses from different animals. These suggest that there might be a wealth of \u201cunknown\u201d coronaviruses which are yet to be identified.",

            "text": "SARS is the first novel infectious respiratory disease in this \u00adcentury. The disease is caused by a coronavirus originating from animals and the clinical presentations of the disease have been extensively reviewed (3). Further studies also indicated that the virus is a distant relative of bat coronaviruses (4), suggesting bats might be natural carriers of the precursor of SARS coronavirus. However, the nature reservoir of SARS coronavirus is still not confirmed. As the majority of SARS patients seroconverted in the second week of disease onset, serological tests might not be a practical approach for early SARS diagnosis (3). Because of these reasons, the focus of early diagnosis was mainly concentrated on the development of conventional and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (3). Besides, several molecular tests which employ non-PCR-based methods, such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (5), rolling circle amplification (6) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (7), were also developed for the detection of SARS coronavirus RNA.",

The protocols described in this chapter are directly adopted from our previous publications (8, 9). The first and second assays are manual RT-PCR (Subheadings 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Subheading 3.5) assays, respectively, for SARS coronavirus detections (see Notes 1\u20133). As there is a possibility that other SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats or other mammals might have zoonotic potential, we also present another PCR assay which is able to detect groups 1 and 2 viruses (Subheading 3.6). This assay might be useful to screen the SARS-like patients whom are negative in the first two assays. It should be noted that the primer set used in the third assay can cross react with a wide range of coronaviruses. Therefore, the identities of all the positive PCR products from the third assay should be formally confirmed by DNA sequencing. In our experiences, this assay is able to detect other common human coronaviruses (e.g. HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E).",

In addition, the quantitative results generated from the real-time RT-PCR might provide additional data from prognosis (3).In our patient cohort, respiratory samples (e.g. nasopharyngeal aspirate, throat swab) collected from patients within the first week of disease onset have the highest positive rates for SARS coronavirus. By contrast, fecal samples have the highest positive rate after the first week of onset. However, to increase the chance of identifying SARS patients in a nonepidemic period, we recommend testing multiple specimens available from suspected patients.For respiratory samples isolated from early disease onset, the detection rates could be enhanced by increasing the initial extraction volume of the NPA sample from 140 to 560 \u03bcL (10).Viral transport medium contains a high concentration of antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth.The primers and probe used in these assays are perfectly matched to those sequences deduced from SARS coronaviruses in human and civets, including those isolated in 2004.Personal protection equipment should be worn by the health-care worker taking specimens from suspect or probable SARS patients (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/infectioncontrol/en/).AVL Buffer containing carrier RNA might form white precipitates when stored at 4\u00b0C. The precipitate can be dissolved in the buffer by heating the bottle in a water bath. Cool the buffer to room temperature before use.For extracting RNA from suspected infectious samples, the procedure must be handled in a biosafety level (BSL) 2 containment using BSL 3 working practices. (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/).General procedures to prevent PCR cross contaminations should be strictly followed. Aerosol-resistant filtered pipette tips could minimize possible carryovers of amplicons. Separate pipettes and areas are used for sampling processing, PCR and post-PCR analysis. It is essential to include multiple positive and negative controls in the PCR reactions when a large number of samples are tested at the same time.Agarose solutions can be superheated in microwave oven. Do not handle bottle immediately after microwaving. Always wear heat-resistant gloves when handling melted agarose.Ethidium bromide is a known mutagen and may be carcinogenic. Handle solutions of ethidium bromide with gloves.UV light can cause severe skin and eye damage. Wear safety glasses and close the photography hood before turning on the UV transilluminator.The conventional RT-PCR protocol is highly specific to SARS coronavirus isolated from respiratory samples. However, we observed a small number of false-positive results from RNA isolated from stools. To overcome this problem, all of our positive fecal samples were retested by the quantitative RT-PCR as described in Subheading 3.5 or using a SYBR green-based RT-PCR assay (11) for confirmation.When performing step 6 in Subheading 3.5, the RNA samples, including those positive standards, must be handled with extreme care. Cross contamination might lead to false-positive or unreliable quantitative results.The amplification curves of all positive samples in the quantitative RT-PCR assays must be examined individually. We occasionally find some clinical specimens might yield high backgrounds and the analytical program might misclassify these samples as positive samples.To exclude negative results due to the poor recovery of RNA, poor performance of the RT-PCR reaction, the presence of PCR inhibitors or human errors, we subsequently modified our quantitative RT-PCR assays to use a duplex assay. The revised test allows simultaneous detection of SARS coronavirus and endogenous 18 S rRNA derived from host cells (12). The primers and probe for 18 S rRNA are commercially available (TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents, Applied Biosystems).The identities of the positive products should be formally confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n",
