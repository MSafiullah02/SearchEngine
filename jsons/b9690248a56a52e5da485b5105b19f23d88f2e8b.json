The conclusion is that actively encouraging students to view the role of the physician through the lens of historical and contemporary trauma enables them to contemplate the difficult question, \"Who's Your Enemy?\" when caring for the sick and themselves.",

First is the difficulty of accepting the fact that military physicians must treat both sides in a conflict equally (meaning the enemy might be cared for first). Students extrapolate this into discussions of the difficulty of treating all patients equally based on their medical issues when they have only limited resources available. Second, they are surprised to discover that war has devastating effects on physicians as well as on combatants and civilians (PTSD). This raises issues such as the development of cynicism and disbelief in physicians when it comes to listening to patients' accounts of trauma and the evolution of clinical detachment in medical school and beyond. Third, stories of trauma prompt students to discuss their negative experiences of caring for patients who are labelled noncompliant, leading to a debate on what exactly compliance means to doctors and patients and what this reveals about the recoding of humans into patients. The co-teachers of Medicine, War, and the Arts encourage students to connect these themes to realise that openly asking the question, \"Who's Your Enemy?\" when caring for the sick is crucial to the best practice of medical care.",

In fact the first time the course was offered, the enrollment was so low that it was cancelled. Resistance to the topic of medicine, war and the arts came from several places; some faculty questioned the use of such a course given that few of the students would become physicians in the military forces or be employed by the Veterans Health Administration. 3 Others were concerned that the topic of war was not traditionally part of a medical humanities curriculum and/or might be too stressful for the students. Support for the course came from faculty who had served in the military and were now often engaged in emergency room work or as surgeons. They felt they had stories to tell and experiences to share with students. As the creator and co-teacher of Medicine, War and the Arts, I found myself defending the decision to offer it. The most powerful arguments involved pointing out that throughout the lifetimes of our students, America had been involved in a succession of serious conflicts. War and its consequences were part of their and their patients' identity. Producing discomfort, uncertainty, and reflection in our students about the theory and practice of medicine in wartime would give them insight and, hopefully, some skills in listening to the traumatic stories and memories of those they hoped to heal. Student evaluations have been consistently positive regarding Medicine, War, and the Arts in terms of high numerical scoring and affirmative statements about the focus on trauma, the meaningful presentations, and the reflection work required.",

What did it mean to be a doctor first and a soldier second or a doctor first and a hospital employee second? How is medical autonomy limited by working for the military or an institution? These questions, raised by the co-directors of the course, the guest presenters, and the readings, were debated throughout the month of class. Often students spoke about the difficulty of treating all patients equally and giving care based purely on diagnosis and prognosis when resources were limited and insurance companies largely dictated treatment plans. It was a struggle to maintain clarity of purpose. This latter point was reinforced by what the students were most surprised bythe discovery that war has devastating effects on healthcare workers as well as on combatants and civilians in the war zone.",

So well does one recall little things that I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit . . . Garden shadows disappeared. The view where a moment before had been so bright and sunny was now dark and hazy . . . To my surprise I discovered that I was completely naked How odd! Where were my drawers and undershirt? 5 (1995, 1) As buildings collapsed and a vicious wind spread the fire, Dr. Hachiya stumbled with his wife to the hospital, noting that he felt no shame in being naked but was bothered by the nakedness of others. Over the course of the next two months, he would document the treatment of massive burns and sight loss in patients, and the development of mysterious symptoms in the survivors, including hair loss, nausea, vomiting, and chronic fatigue; once he obtains a microscope, the doctor realises that low blood counts are also a factor in how profoundly sick his patients (and he and his wife) are. Students find this diary intriguing because it works on so many levels to pique their medical interest. First, it is a detective story, as Dr. Hachiya, like everyone else in Hiroshima, has no idea what the weapon is that had been used against him; some kind of poison gas was a strong contender. While we know that the sufferers have radiation sickness, the healthcare workers and patients do not. Second, there is the calmness and work ethic of Dr. Hachiya that captures the imagination of the students as they seek to put themselves in his shoes and assess how they would deal with such a traumatic event. Is the doctor by nature calm, or is it a cultural value, or is he clinically detached from being a long-time physician? Each of these scenarios is debated with students striving to understand what happens to feelings in times of trauma as empathy may be overcome by a need for efficiency or death spoken of with no hint of grief as healthcare workers persevere in caring for the victims.",

A Professor of Bioethics who researches and continues to enter the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor disaster area gives a presentation on the reactions of the local populace to the disaster, including artwork and memorials. This allows for further conversations on how culture affects responses to mass traumatic events and what memories are preserved and why. As with Dr. Hachiya who went to his hospital in Hiroshima and began triage and then making daily rounds on his patients, healthcare workers near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor ran to their hospital to aid the injured rather than attempting to flee the region with their families.",

I would like to tell him, 'Patients like you, who I cannot cure, cause me the most sorrow. 6 (2007, 4) Tram's voice, and her youth, optimism, and idealism, typically captivate students in Medicine, War and the Arts. She is like them in so many ways but her experiences (along with her politics) are almost unimaginable to them: 29 July 1969: The war is extremely cruel. This morning, they bring me a wounded soldier. A phosphorus bomb has burned his entire body. An hour after being hit, he is still burning, smoke rising from his body. This is Khanh, a twenty-year-old man, the son of a sister cadre in the hamlet where I'm staying. An unfortunate accident caused the bomb to explode and severely burned the man. Nobody recognizes him as the cheerful, handsome man he once was. Today his smiling, joyful black eyes have been reduced to two little holesthe yellowish eyelids are cooked. The reeking burn of phosphorus smoke still rises from his body. He looks as if he has been roasted in an oven. (142) The unwillingness of Tram to leave the side of her patients and her desire to be politically engaged and to commit to a cause in spite of great personal sacrifice challenges medical students to consider what the broader role of a healer might beto protect, fight, and risk physical and psychological harm. If Tram had survived the war, she would in all likelihood have the disease now known as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. The historical antecedents and labelling of various conditions as nostalgia, shellshock, soldier's heart, and combat fatigue are also explained in the course.",

Cooperatively designing a war memorial and then building a model of it prompts students to define what is worthy of recognition and to think deeply about what it means to be a physician in war. Groups of students have built dioramas, written prose or poetry, and found other ways to memorialise the professional activities of military physicians. They have drawn on all the stories of trauma incorporated into this one-month course and in particular have focused on what they have discovered about themselves as physicians in training, who already are starting to regard some patients as their enemies. They have reflected upon the concept that to be labelled as difficult and non-compliant is akin to being written off, as not only valueless to society but as an enemy to be feared and avoided, rather than as a fellow human to be protected and healed.",
