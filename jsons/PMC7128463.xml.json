The first barrier against invasion of RNA viruses is a cytosolic innate intracellular defense response that is present in all cell types and is initiated by activation of the viral RNA-sensing innate immune receptors RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) in the cytosol (Gitlin et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2006, Loo et al., 2008). Upon sensing of viral RNA, RIG-I or MDA5 induces type I interferon (IFN) secretion leading to upregulation of antiviral IFN-induced proteins in the infected and neighboring cells, which inhibits virus replication or protects against new infection. Further downstream events attract immune cells and trigger the adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "Discrimination of a few viral RNA molecules from the abundant host RNA in the cytosol occurs by detection of unusual structures or modifications of the viral RNA. The structural features leading to recognition by MDA5 have remained elusive. By contrast, because of high-resolution structures of RIG-I/ligand complexes, the mechanism of RNA recognition by RIG-I is well understood (Civril et al., 2011, Jiang et al., 2011, Kowalinski et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2010, Luo et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2010). RIG-I is activated by double-stranded 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA (ppp-dsRNA) (Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006, Schlee and Hartmann, 2010, Schlee et al., 2009). Like most viral RNAs, endogenous mRNA and RNA polymerase III transcripts are also 5\u2032-triphosphorylated. However, mRNAs of eukaryotes possess a cap structure consisting of a triphosphorylated 5\u2032 end that is 5\u2032-5\u2032 linked to a guanosine methylated at N7 (m7G) (Figure 1\nA). The m7G cap is essential for eIF4a-dependent mRNA-dependent protein translation from yeast to vertebrates. 2\u2032O-methyl modifications at N1 and N2 are conserved features of mRNA cap structures of higher eukaryotes (Banerjee, 1980) but haven\u2019t been implicated in mRNA translation control so far (B\u00e9langer et al., 2010). A number of differences between eukaryotic RNA and microbial RNAs have been described that explain the discrimination of self and non-self by RIG-I. Apart from the presence of a 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety in fully base-paired regions in various microbial RNA species, this also includes certain modifications in eukaryotic RNAs that exert an inhibitory function on otherwise stimulatory RNA molecules. This includes backbone and nucleobase modifications in eukaryotic RNAs, a well as m7G cap modification of eukaryotic mRNAs (Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006). The relative contribution of these activating or inhibiting signatures in putative RIG-I ligands remains to be determined, especially in light of the fact that in vitro transcription was used to study the impact of the latter modifications (Goubau et al., 2014, Schlee et al., 2009, Schmidt et al., 2009; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In the present study, by using synthetic pppRNA, we re-assessed the impact of m7G on RIG-I stimulation and analyzed also the influence of single modifications (including G methylation at N7 and 2\u2032O-methylation of the N1 and N2 position of the RNA) on the interaction with RIG-I. We found that a m7G cap alone could only partially reduce RIG-I stimulation at low RIG-I ligand concentrations, whereas the 2\u2032O-methylation of the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide (N1) entirely abrogated RIG-I activation even at high ligand concentrations. Structure-guided mutational analysis led to the identification of a highly conserved histidine (H830) in the RNA binding domain of RIG-I, which is dispensable for RIG-I activation but mediates steric exclusion of N1-methylated RNA. We furthermore provide evidence that endogenous RNA stimulated RIG-I in the absence of endogenous cap1 2\u2032O-methylation or if H830 was mutated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RNA viruses exploited this tolerance mechanism to avoid recognition by RIG-I. The 100% conservation of this \u201clicensing\u201d histidine position in RIG-I among vertebrates and even sea anemone RIG-I highlights a fundamental role of this self-RNA tolerance mechanism in evolution. As such, this is the first study showing the biological relevance of endogenous cap 2\u2032O-methylation and the corresponding enzymes for immune tolerance of self-RNA, a pathway that is relevant for any cell type in the body.",

            "text": "Capping of mRNA is required for effective ribosomal translation. Three forms of cap structures are known: cap0 is a N7-methyl guanosine (m7G) linked to the gamma phosphate of the 5\u2032-triphosphate of RNA (m7GpppNN; N = nucleotide; Figure 1A); cap1 is identical to cap0 except for an additional 2\u2032O-methyl group at the N1 position (m7GpppNmN); and cap2 carries a second 2\u2032O-methyl group at the N2 position (m7GpppNmNm). Although the cap N7-methyl guanosine in cap structures is well known to be required for effective ribosomal translation, the impact of the 2\u2032O-methyl groups at N1 and N2 on translation is unclear. So far, it has been described that replication of (+)ssRNA viruses lacking the viral N1-2\u2032O-methyl transferase is restricted by the type I IFN-induced, pppRNA binding protein IFIT1 (Abbas et al., 2013, Daffis et al., 2010, Habjan et al., 2013, Pichlmair et al., 2011). To study the impact of the different components of cap structures on immunorecognition of RNA by RIG-I, we established methods to generate well-characterized 24-mer RNA oligonucleotides with identical sequence and containing a 5\u2032-triphosphate with additional single or combined features of the cap0/1/2 structures (e.g., with or without guanosine cap, N7-methylated guanosine cap, 2\u2032O-methyl at N1 or N2; see Figures S2A\u2013S2E and Table S1). These RNA oligonucleotides were hybridized with complementary RNA (antisense RNA oligonucleotide: AsGA; Table S1) resulting in short double-stranded blunt-end RNA oligonucleotides (ppp-dsRNA). The double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were transfected into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of chloroquine, which eliminates endosomal TLR-mediated recognition. In this setting, IFN-\u03b1 induction by short ppp-dsRNA is exclusively mediated by RIG-I (Schlee et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2010). We found that 5\u2032ppp5\u2032-linked G (GpppGA) did not impair RIG-I activation (Figure 1B), whereas N7-methylation of the 5\u2032ppp5\u2032-linked G (cap0 = m7GpppGA; Figure 1B) only partially reduced IFN-\u03b1 induction at the concentrations used (2.5 nM). In dose response experiments, complete inhibition of RIG-I activation by m7G cap was seen at concentrations below 0.5 nM (Figure 1C). By contrast, a single 2\u2032O-methyl group at N1 (pppGmA) completely abolished RIG-I activation at all RNA concentrations tested (up to 15.8 nM; Figures 1B and 1C). The combination of the 2\u2032O-methyl group at N1 and m7G as in cap1 (m7GpppGmA; Figure 1B) also showed no activity. However, 2\u2032O-methylation at N2 with and without m7G (m7GpppGAm, pppGAm) only partially reduced the RIG-I activity (Figure 1B). These data reveal a dominant role of the 2\u2032O-methyl group at N1 for the inability of RIG-I to sense capped pppRNA. Stimulation of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) deficient for Ifih1 (encoding MDA5) or Ddx58 (encoding RIG-I) with ligands comprising different cap structures confirmed the exclusive detection of capped pppRNA by RIG-I and the absolute inhibitory effect of 2\u2032O-methylation (Figure 1D).",

            "text": "RIG-I is composed of two N-terminal signaling adaptor domains (CARD), a helicase domain (DECH), and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which was identified to harbor the pppRNA binding site (Cui et al., 2008, Takahasi et al., 2008). The CTD possesses a basic binding cleft with ppp-dsRNA-CTD interactions at amino acids F853 (5\u2032-terminal base pair stacking), K858, H847, K861, K888 (ppp binding), K907 (internucleotide phosphate binding), and H830 (contact to 2\u2032OH of N1) (Lu et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010). We mutated selected amino acids of the binding pocket of RIG-I to alanine and expressed the full-length RIG-I constructs in HEK293blue cells, which lack RIG-I activity, if not primed by type I IFN. The IP10 gene is known to be directly activated by RIG-I (Brownell et al., 2014). IP10 secretion was studied as a surrogate parameter of RIG-I activation after stimulation with synthetic ppp-dsRNA or ppp-ssRNA (Figure 2\nA). The highly conserved amino acids F853, K861, K888, and K907 (Figure S1), which are part of the basic ppp-dsRNA binding cleft of the CTD domain, were essential for RIG-I activation by ppp-dsRNA (Figure 2A). Although the highly conserved H830 is in contact with 2\u2032OH of N1, the H830A mutation did not decrease but instead increased ppp-dsRNA-induced RIG-I stimulation (Figure 2A). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that this increase was not due to higher expression of the mutated RIG-I(H830A) (Figure 2B). Indeed, its 100% conservation across all known vertebrate species and sea anemone RIG-I (Figure S1) points to a key function of H830 in RIG-I biology. Because H830 is not required for RIG-I activation and given its position in proximity to N1, we speculated that H830 might be involved in a steric interference of the 2\u2032O-methyl group (trans-C3\u2032-oriented) through its side chain (Figure 2C; Wang et al., 2010). To address this hypothesis, we performed a set of experiments in which we compared wild-type (WT) RIG-I to RIG-I(H830A) by using different pppRNA ligands. Indeed, in contrast to RIG-I(WT), the RIG-I(H830A) mutant was still activated by ppp-dsRNA containing 2\u2032O-methyl at N1 (pppGmA) and showed considerable activation in the presence of a complete cap1 structure (m7GpppGmA) (Figure 2D, black bars).",

One possible explanation for this residual interaction with RIG-I(WT) could be non-productive binding as reported previously (Marq et al., 2011). Here, RIG-I binding was reported for ligands that could not activate RIG-I or induce type I IFN. In particular, dsRNA with an overhanging 5\u2032-ppp-nucleotide (ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA) was observed to be a weak competitor for blunt ppp-dsRNA (Marq et al., 2011). To test whether N1-2\u2032O-methylation has similar effects as a 5\u2032-ppp-overhang, we performed a competition assay as described previously (Marq et al., 2011). We transfected ppp-dsRNA as pppGA hybridized to asGA (pppGA+asGA) mixed with a 24-fold excess of asGA (single-stranded control, non-binder), pppGmA+asGA (blunt N1-2\u2032O-methylated), or pppGA+asGA(\u22121) (ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, non-productive binder) (Figure S2F; Marq et al., 2011). Although ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, as previously published, reduced RIG-I stimulation by ppp-dsRNA 2-fold, no competitive inhibition via N1-2\u2032O-methylated ppp-dsRNA (pppGmA) could be detected. Thus, unlike ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, pppGmA binding does not seem to be sufficient to block binding of pppGA in this setting.",

            "text": "The high conservation of H830 in RIG-I and its function in interference with accurate binding of 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA carrying a 2\u2032O-methyl group at N1 suggest the existence of self-RNA molecules that depend on N1 methylation to evade recognition by RIG-I. Although base-paired 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA is required for RIG-I stimulation, GpppNN-RNA intermediates with such RIG-I ligand properties might occur, causing some degree of immune stimulation in the absence of 2\u2032O-methylation (or in the presence of the mutated form of RIG-I that accepts 2\u2032O-methylation). Indeed, we found that long-term expression of RIG-I(H830A) in HEK293blue cells lacking RIG-I activity led to a significant IP10 response in the absence of exogenous RIG-I ligand (Figure 3\nA, black bars). To show that IP10 induction is induced by endogenous RNA species, we overexpressed RIG-I-CTD-FLAG in HEK293blue cells and purified endogenous RNA bound to immunoprecipitated RIG-I-CTD-FLAG (Figure 3B, left). RIG-I-bound endogenous RNA stimulated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not RIG-I(WT) (Figure 3B, right). The RIG-I-stimulating activity of isolated endogenous RNA was partially sensitive to alkaline phosphatase (AP), which hydrolyzes free phosphates, and to treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), which hydrolyzes the triphosphate bridge of mRNA caps (Figure S3A). However, only the combined treatment abolished RIG-I stimulation, indicating the presence of stimulatory capped and uncapped pppRNA species (Figure 3B). It was reported that mRNA cap1 2\u2032O-methylation occurs in the nucleus and is performed by the endogenous cap1 methyltransferase MTr1 (B\u00e9langer et al., 2010, Perry and Kelley, 1976). To study the impact of diminished 2\u2032O-methylation of endogenous RNA transcripts, we knocked down hMTr1 in primary human fibroblasts (Figures 3C and S3B). Intriguingly, inhibition of endogenous cap methylation induced a substantial type I IFN response 72 hr after hMTr1 knock down (Figure 3C). Correspondingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of MTr1 induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in primed A549 cells (Figure 3D). By contrast, RIG-I-deficient A549 cells did not upregulate IFN-\u03b2 upon depletion of MTr1 (Figures 3D and S3C). A similar scenario held true in HEK293blue cells silenced for hMTr1 (Figures 3E and S3D) and lacking significant endogenous RIG-I activity. Expression of RIG-I(WT) in combination with knockdown of hMTr1 (Figure 3E, right) led to increased IP10 production as compared to the control setting (Figure 3E, left). Overexpression of RIG-I(H830A) by itself also led to an increased IP10 response, yet additional silencing of hMTr1 did not considerably augment RIG-I(H830A)-induced IP10 levels (Figure 3E, right). Altogether these results indicated that hMTr1 activity was required for an active suppression of endogenous RNA recognition by RIG-I.",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms that allow capping and methylation of viral RNA in the cytosol. Flaviviruses (positive ssRNA) express the NS5 protein, which performs RNA polymerization as well as guanine N7 and ribose 2\u2032O-methylations (Figure S4; Zhou et al., 2007). To examine whether cytosolic RNA viruses use N1-2\u2032O-methylation to suppress type I IFN induction by RIG-I, we constructed a yellow fever virus replicon (YFVR-WT) and abrogated 2\u2032O-methylation activity of NS5 by mutation of NS5-E218 to A (YFVR-E218A) (Zhou et al., 2007); replication was monitored by renilla luciferase activity encoded by YFVR (Figure S4B). YFVR-E218A (no cap1 methylation of RNA) replication was strongly impaired in A549 cells as compared to the YFVR-WT (Figure 4\nA, WT versus 218). By contrast, no difference in replication of both YFV replicons was found in Vero cells, which lack type I IFN genes (Figure 4B, WT versus 218). Likewise, when A549 or Vero cells were infected with whole yellow fever virus particles (Figures 4C and 4D), the NS5-E218A mutation impaired virus production in A549 cells to a much higher extent (>60-fold reduction, Figure 4C) than in Vero cells (<5-fold reduction, Figure 4D). These data indicate that cap1 methylation is involved in the immune escape of yellow fever virus from a type I IFN-dependent host restriction system. To further strengthen this hypothesis, we used RIG-I-deficient and STAT1-deficient A549 cells to assess the influence on YFV replication (Figure 4E). Intriguingly, YFV-E218A reached the same virus titer in RIG-I-deficient A549 cells as the wild-type virus. Similar to Vero cells, the replication of YFV-E218A was not impaired in STAT1-deficient A549 cells. Viral replication was reflected by induction of the type I IFN response (Figure 4F). As determined 8 hr after infection, YFV-E218A induced a 4-fold higher IFIT1 expression than wild-type YFV. By contrast, no considerable induction of IFIT1 was detected in RIG-I- and STAT1-deficient A549 cells. The data demonstrate that RIG-I is essential for type I IFN induction by YFV in A549 cells. Furthermore, these data clearly show that the ability of YFV to methylate RNA (lost with the mutation E218A) reduces immunorecognition of the virus by RIG-I and enhances viral replication. In HEK293blue cells lacking endogenous RIG-I expression, YFVR-WT and YFVR-E218A induced IP10 only when RIG-I was expressed (Figure 4G). Analogous to cells with reduced endogenous MTr1 (Figure 3E), YFVR-E218A lacking the viral N1-2\u2032O-methyltransferase activity induced a 3-fold higher IP10 level than YFVR-WT in RIG-I(WT)-expressing cells (Figure 4G, RIG-I WT blue versus orange). On the other hand, RIG-I(H830A), ignoring 2\u2032O-methylation status, induced equal amounts of IP10 in response to YFVR-WT and YFVR-E218A (Figure 4G), up to the same level as the response to YFVR-E218A RNA in RIG-I(WT) transfected cells.",

            "text": "We found that sufficient self-tolerance necessitates several levels of self-RNA labeling and that methylations are the decisive modifications to prohibit recognition by RIG-I. By using chemically synthesized RNA, we are now able to dissect single modifications independently and quantify their contributions. Non-methylated 0G cap alone did not affect RIG-I stimulation. This is in accordance with the ppp-dsRNA/RIG-I crystal structure (Lu et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010) from which it can be predicted that a 0G cap does not sterically interfere with binding to RIG-I. By contrast, N7-methylation (m7G cap) impaired RIG-I stimulation at low ligand concentrations but not to a full extent. In previous studies, we found a higher inhibitory impact of the methylguanidine (m7G) cap0 structure, which can be explained by the in vitro transcription process used to generate these ligands (Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Additional N7-methylation introduces a positive charge into the cap, which weakens the interaction with the basic (positively charged) pppRNA-binding cleft. Furthermore, m7G mediates binding to eIF4A (Fechter and Brownlee, 2005), potentially competing with binding to RIG-I. Both effects can reduce RIG-I activation but are not sufficient to mediate the complete ignorance of self 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA by RIG-I. Our data show that complete self-tolerance is accomplished by a single 2\u2032O-methyl group at the 5\u2032-terminal residue (N1), a characteristic molecular feature of higher eukaryotes\u2019 mRNA (Banerjee, 1980). This immune tolerance is mediated by a single highly conserved amino acid, H830, in the pppRNA-binding domain of RIG-I. The responsible histidine is present in all known species that express RIG-I and was therefore deemed to be involved in RNA binding (Lu et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010). Mutation of H830 to alanine restored the binding of and stimulation by 2\u2032O-methyl pppRNA while the stimulatory activity of non-methyl pppRNA remained unaffected, highlighting an exclusive immune regulatory function of H830. N1-2\u2032O-methylated and non-methylated ppp-dsRNAs or m7Gppp-dsRNA bind with considerably different affinities to wild-type RIG-I but with similar affinities to mutant RIG-I(H830A), indicating a direct steric effect of H830 on N1-2\u2032O-methylated RNA. An inactive ligand (pppGmA) still showed residual but non-productive RIG-I binding. The discrepancy between binding (only 5-fold reduction) and biological activity (no RIG-I activation at any concentration) might appear contradictory at first view. However, an assay that simply measures binding affinity can resolve neither the site nor the orientation of protein/ligand interaction. Previously, non-productive binding to RIG-I of dsRNA with competitive, ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, and non-competitive, blunt OH-dsRNA, ligands has been reported (Marq et al., 2011). Our competition assay revealed that N1-2\u2032O-methylated dsRNA is a much weaker competitive inhibitor than ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA (if at all) for pppGA binding. Thus, pppGmA has a similar profile to the blunt OH-dsRNA sequences used by Marq et al. (2011). These sequences can bind RIG-I but are nonetheless incapable of inhibiting pppGA binding or inducing type I IFN. In retrospect, because both blunt OH-dsRNA and pppGmA cannot properly interact with the lysine-rich binding cleft, the similarities observed between these two classes of dsRNA are completely in line with our other data. Although we demonstrate that pppGmA is sterically hindered by H830, OH-dsRNA clearly lacks the phosphates requisite for binding-cleft interaction. By contrast, ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA should be able to interact with the designated binding cleft (K888, K858, K861, H830, K907), and it could be that this is essential to its ability to act as a competitive, non-productive ligand. Nonetheless, from our data we cannot conclude whether the detected pppGmA/RIG-I interaction results from an inaccurate binding as a result from a distorted helix orientation within the binding cleft or whether interaction is mediated by other, unspecific contacts. Whatever the nature of this interaction, it does not succeed in RIG-I activation.",

Moreover, in this physiological situation, these two modifications are strongly synergistic. m7G-capping mediates a reduction in type I IFN induction for RIG-I(WT) and RIG-I(H830A) alike, and additional N1-methylation of m7G-capped dsRNA (m7GpppGmA) completely abrogates the interaction with RIG-I(WT).

Phosphatase treatment of endogenous RNA revealed that in the cell both capped and uncapped RNA molecules exist that stimulate mutant RIG-I(H830A). Base-paired RNA structures can be a result of intra- or intermolecular base pairing or could be formed by a recently described endogenous RNA replication mechanism (Kapranov et al., 2010). The fact that stimulation of RIG-I(H830A) by endogenous RNA was relatively weak indicates that the concentration of stimulatory RIG-I ligands is either low or that endogenous RIG-I ligands present a suboptimal ligand structure.

Accordingly, the replication of the mutated virus YFV-E218A was strongly impaired in A549 cells but not in Vero- or STAT1-deficient A549 cells, which have a defect in type I IFN signaling. Intriguingly, viral titers of YFV-E218A and YFV-WT were equal in RIG-I-deficient A549 cells. IFIT1 mRNA (as an indicator of type I IFN induction) was induced more strongly by YFV-E218A than YFV-WT.

They showed that the type I IFN-induced protein IFIT1 mediates repression of WNV-E218A replication in the brain (in vivo) and in macrophages in vitro (Daffis et al., 2010). As revealed by their experiments, the type I IFN-induced IFIT1 protein could act only downstream of MAVS-dependent type I IFN-inducing pathways, which in turn requires prior detection of the viral RNA via either RIG-I or MDA5 (Daffis et al., 2010). In a follow-up study, the same group observed that Ifit\n\u2212/\u2212 mice still survive subcutaneous WNV-E218A infection at a viral titer that is lethal for wild-type WNV (Szretter et al., 2012), suggesting 2\u2032O-methylation-sensitive immune mechanisms beyond IFIT1. Altogether, this is in line with our results that RIG-I is a 2\u2032O-methylation-sensitive receptor of viral RNA and that IFIT1 expression is induced by RIG-I and therefore cannot act without prior upregulation by type I IFN-inducing receptors like RIG-I.",

(2011) observed that a mutant of the (+)ssRNA coronavirus MHV lacking viral N1-2\u2032O-methyltransferase activity showed enhanced IFN-\u03b2 induction and suppressed virus replication in murine macrophages and that both effects were MDA5 dependent. However, MDA5 deficiency neither led to restoration of WNV-E218A infectivity in primary cells nor rescued WNV-E218A virulence in mice (Szretter et al., 2012). In addition, a viral mRNA has been identified, which stimulated MDA5, when expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase-II-controlled promoter that produces N1-2\u2032O-methylated mRNA (cap1 structure) (Luthra et al., 2011), which suggests that N1-2\u2032O-methylation does not generally impair MDA5 engagement. None of the above studies examined RIG-I-deficient cells. In the light of our results and the above mentioned data (Daffis et al., 2010, Szretter et al., 2012), we conclude that IFIT1 acts as type I IFN-induced effector downstream of type I IFN-inducing receptors (e.g., RIG-I and MDA5) to sequester viral mRNA from translation (Habjan et al., 2013). Because no direct impact of N1-2\u2032O-methylation on binding of viral RNA to MDA5 was shown, still an indirect effect remains possible. Because coronavirus recognition in murine macrophages is known to require MDA5 (Roth-Cross et al., 2008), it is conceivable that stimulation via MDA5 is required for type I IFN-dependent upregulation of IFIT1, which then sequesters non-2\u2032O-methyl RNA, thereby inhibiting translation of viral proteins, which suppress recognition of RNA or interfere with type I IFN-inducing pathways. In this study, we provide molecular evidence for a direct physical interaction of RIG-I and RNA, which is sterically impaired by 2\u2032O-methyl at the N1 position, leading to abolishment of RIG-I activation.",

To our knowledge, RIG-I is the first example of an innate immune receptor that adapted its structure to tolerate self-RNA (that is actively labeled self in the nucleus) rather than adapting its structure to detect a specific foreign molecule. Thus, like the adaptive immune system, innate immunity employs active mechanisms that secure tolerance toward self while potently responding to foreign molecular pattern.
