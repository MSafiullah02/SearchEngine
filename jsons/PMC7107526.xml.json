Oral ingestion of ciprofloxacin was directly observed by healthcare workers to ensure adherence. All pilgrims travelling from polio risk countries received 1 dose of oral polio vaccine at borders points on arrival in Saudi Arabia regardless of age and vaccination status.

The hospital teams were reinforced by 21 fixed and 15 mobile surveillance teams from the regional directorates to ensure 24-h active surveillance during the Hajj.15 Whereas each fixed team consisted of 1 medical doctor and 1 health inspector, each mobile team was made up of 2 medical doctors (a male and a female), 1 health inspector and 1 driver. These personnel were drawn from different regional health directorates, across the country and mobilized for a 4-day refresher course, accredited by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties. Among other relevant topics, the refresher course was focused on discussing the current trends in the management and control of infectious diseases as well as the reporting formats and tools for infectious diseases surveillance during Hajj. The fixed surveillance teams were assigned to each hospital operating in the Hajj areas and reviewed admission logbooks for cases with clinical features of infectious diseases and followed up on cases admitted into the wards to identify and report suspected cases of notifiable diseases to ensure no cases were missed by the hospital surveillance teams. The mobile surveillance teams were tasked to conduct field investigations for reported cases of infectious diseases.

The medical offices are required to comply with the standard sanitary requirements for food preparation and handling, to educate pilgrims on personal hygiene and proper waste disposal and to submit a valid contract with an accredited firm for medical waste management to the regional directorates. Additionally, they are required to provide daily reports on notifiable diseases, to establish isolation areas for suspected cases and to coordinate with the public health supervisory teams for the safe transfer of these cases when necessary. Of the 60 country medical offices operational during the 2015 Hajj only 20 (33%) were found to be compliant with the standard requirements of the Saudi MoH. The inconsistency of some medical representatives, with regards to compliance with the requirements of the MoH and the frequent change of medical teams by countries sending pilgrims, often soon after the Hajj limits sustainable partnership between the MoH and the medical offices for pilgrims.",

HESN is a web-based electronic solution, introduced by the Saudi MoH to improve communication among public health professionals involved in outbreak management as well as to provide quality health data for planning and effective allocation of resources. HESN was initially implemented as a pilot in Makkah region of Saudi Arabia in 2012. By January 2014, a country-wide implementation was initiated to control the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom. During the 2015 Hajj, in addition to the traditional data capture and reporting tools, the hospital surveillance teams also collated and entered infectious diseases data directly into HESN once a notification was received from the laboratory, emergency rooms, isolation wards and other departments in hospitals. The uploaded data were immediately displayed on electronic dash boards in the CCC\u2019s situation rooms. Data were analysed and reports generated in real-time that could be immediately accessed by public health officials and decision makers or disseminated through phone messages to responsible persons for immediate action.",

This contributed to the development of modern surveillance systems for the Hajj, evolving from the paper-based reporting tools to a more efficient web-based electronic surveillance systems. Enhanced IDSSs were introduced to complement the conventional surveillance system in addressing the increased risks of infectious diseases transmission and outbreaks during the Hajj. Existing electronic surveillance systems (HESN and CITREX) automatically generates reports and have the advantage of timeliness, as public health personnel at different locations can access and synchronize information management once data is captured at the reporting sites. However, the implication of having parallel systems capturing and interpreting the same health data has some potential implications, including duplication of work, depletion of already limited resources during Hajj and uncertainty of the accuracy of the data. Therefore, there is a need to conduct operational studies to assess the feasibility of integrating the diverse surveillance systems utilized during Hajj into one efficient tool. Prioritizing systems that remain operational for routine surveillance after Hajj may promote the most efficient use of resources.14 Furthermore, there is need to sustain the enhanced surveillance system and other public health interventions at key locations in the Kingdom, including the points of entry, after the Hajj, as a prevention and control strategy for the international spread of diseases during other mass gatherings with international dimensions, principally the Umrah pilgrimage. It is estimated that over 8 million pilgrims arrive to the Kingdom yearly to participate in the Umrah, which occurs nearly all-year round.",

Symptomatic pilgrims who prefer \u2018quick-to-access\u2019 pharmacies may not present to the health facilities, eluding the current notifiable disease surveillance systems operational during Hajj. Syndromic surveillance uses aggregated data of symptom groups from a wide range of sources that precedes clinical diagnosis to set thresholds for responding to a threat.14 This kind of surveillance is also useful for dispelling or confirming rumours of outbreaks, based on changes in the reported number of aggregated cases in an area.11 The potential benefits of syndromic surveillance during mass gatherings were reported during previous Olympic games. For example, the syndromic surveillance system implemented during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games improved the detection and response time to potential outbreaks during the games.20 Additionally, the daily syndromic surveillance data captured during the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympic Games reassured public health officials and political office holders of the absence of outbreaks, which substantially impacted on planning, and boosted the legacy of the event.11 Thus, the MoH through the global centre for mass gatherings medicine (GCMGM) and the Saudi field epidemiology training programme is setting up a syndromic surveillance system for the Hajj and Umra mass gatherings to complement the enhanced IDSS, as an early warning system for public health threats. This system may become operational during the 2016 Hajj.",

Rather, it starts well before they arrive to the Kingdom and lasts long after they have returned to their home countries. Prevention of importation and exportation of infectious agents in Hajj is key for global health security and effective infectious disease surveillance both in the Kingdom during Hajj, as well as in the countries of origin of pilgrims, is crucial in achieving this. Therefore, it is apparent that there is a great need for the development of a well-structured, harmonized and effective collaboration, data collection and information sharing network involving the Saudi health authorities and representatives from all countries sending pilgrims to the Hajj.
