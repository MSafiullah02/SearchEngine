The pseudovirus was preincubated with serially diluted rabbit sera at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before addition to cells.

The serum samples at 1:10,000 dilution were tested for binding to the recombinant fusion protein RBD-Fc by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2\nA, the antisera collected 10 days after the 1st boost had the maximum reactivity with RBD-Fc and retained the high levels after the 2nd and 3rd boosts. The mean end-point titers of the antisera collected after the 1st boost were 1:7,812,500 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we used these antisera samples for subsequent experiments. Since RBD-Fc also contains a human IgG-Fc fragment, the antibodies in the rabbit sera may also bind to Fc, in addition to RBD. Therefore, we tested the binding activity of rabbit antisera against the recombinant protein S1-C9, which contains RBD but not Fc. As shown in Figs. 2C and D, rabbit antisera bound to S1-C9 in a pattern similar to that shown in the experiments using RBD-Fc as antigen shown in Figs. 2A and B, although the reactivity and titers (1:312,500) of the antibodies against S1-C9 were lower than those to RBD-Fc.

Anti-Fc-depleted antisera retained the RBD-binding activity (Fig. 5B) and neutralizing activity (Fig. 5C), comparable with untreated rabbit antisera. These results suggest that the anti-Fc antibodies in the antisera induced by human IgG-Fc had no contribution to the RBD-binding and virus-neutralizing activity of the rabbit antisera.",

Since RBD-Fc can also react with the anti-Fc antibodies in the antisera directed against RBD-Fc, we used S1-C9 which contains only RBD, but not Fc in all the experiments for determining the binding of RBD. In ELISA, soluble ACE2 was coated on the wells of ELISA plates and S1-C9 was able to bind to ACE2 (data not shown). Rabbit anti-RBD antisera effectively blocked S1 binding to ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner while the pre-immune sera had no inhibitory activity (Fig. 6\nA). Soluble ACE2 coated on plastics may lose the native conformation, so we also used cell expressed ACE2, which is expected to retain the native conformation, for detecting the RBD-binding activity in a flow-cytometric assay. As shown in Fig. 6B, S1-C9 significantly bound to ACE2-expressed cells as measured using anti-C9 mAb 1D4 (positive control). If no S1-C9 was added (negative control), only background signals were detected. Rabbit antisera at 1:100 effectively blocked S1 binding to ACE2-expressed cells while pre-immune rabbit sera at the same dilution had no inhibitory activity (Fig. 6B). The inhibitory activity of the rabbit antisera on S1 binding to ACE2-expressed cells was dose-dependent. Depletion of anti-Fc antibodies from the rabbit antisera did not affect the inhibitory activity of the rabbit antisera on S1-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 6C), confirming that the anti-RBD activity is not mediated by anti-Fc antibodies.",

These agents are effective in inducing a protective neutralizing-antibody response in animals [34], [35], [36]. In the present study, we used a recombinant fusion protein (RBD-Fc) as an immunogen to immunize rabbits since RBD is a key functional domain in the S protein responsible for viral binding to receptor on the target cell [24], [25], [26] and contains neutralizing epitopes [47]. Antibodies against RBD on the S proteins of other coronaviruses, such as MHV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) [48], [49], [50], and those against receptors for the coronaviruses [51], [52] are highly effective in blocking RBD-receptor interaction and neutralizing infection by the corresponding coronaviruses. Here we found that the RBD-Fc fusion protein elicited robust antibody responses in the immunized rabbits and the rabbit antisera could completely block SARS-CoV infection at the serum dilution of 1:10,240 (Fig. 3).",

The S proteins from some coronaviruses could also induce enhancing antibodies. For example, immunization of felines with a vaccinia virus vector encoding the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) resulted in enhancement of virus replication after virus challenge [37], [38] and the epitopes that elicit enhancing antibodies were localized in the S protein [56]. Although no enhanced virus replication may be observed [34], [35], this may not exclude the possibility that the enhancing antibody titers are lower than neutralizing antibody titers. In such a case, enhancing antibodies may suppress or \u201cneutralize\u201d the neutralizing-antibody activity, resulting in reduced neutralizing-antibody titers.",

            "text": "The sequences of S proteins, especially the S1 domains, of most coronaviruses are highly variable [14], which is a major concern in developing effective vaccines against virus strains with distinct genotypes and phenotypes. However, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV strains are quite stable and do not change as much as that was originally predicted [10]. At the early phase of SARS endemic in 2002/2003, 5 out of the 193 amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein are variable due to the positive selection pressure in the process of transition from animal (e.g., palm civet) SARS-like-CoV to human SARS-CoV. However, at the middle and late phases (most virus strains were isolated from SARS patients during these two phases), there is no mutation in the RBD sequence [6]. Furthermore, the conformation of RBD is relatively conserved to ensure the binding of virus with different subtypes to a specific receptor on the target cells, even though the linear sequence of RBD may be variable. One example is B12 mAb which recognizes the neutralizing epitopes on the CD4-binding domain on HIV-1 gp120 and neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 primary isolates, although the linear sequences of CD4-binding regions in gp120 from the corresponding strains are highly variable [57], [58]. These suggest that anti-antibodies against conserved RBD of the S protein may have neutralizing activity against a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV strains.",
