This induction occurs within a few hours of the infection, and IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 has a number of antiviral functions [1]. First, IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 directly induces antiviral activities in the uninfected, neighboring cells. This prevents viral spread by increasing the resistance of uninfected cells toward the virus. Second, IFNs can activate natural killer (NK) cell\u2010mediated cytotoxity toward virus\u2010infected cells [2, 3]. Third, there is accumulating evidence that IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 contributes to driving the adaptive\u2010immune response in the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) direction via stimulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression [4, 5].",

One of the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010activated leukocytes is the macrophage, which is sensitive to IFN\u2010\u03b3 and other proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) [7]. Macrophages participate in the antiviral response through production of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines [8] as well as by working as an antigen\u2010presenting cell (APC). It is also possible that macrophages contribute to antiviral defense via phagocytosis of extracellular virus and infected apoptotic cells [7]. Dendritic cells (DCs) also participate in the antiviral response through several mechanisms [9]. First, DCs are probably the main APC, thus playing a pivotal role in development and maturation of the specific immune response. Second, this cell type participates in coordinating the inflammatory response, through production of cytokines and chemokines (see below). In particular, cells of the DC lineage have recently been shown to represent the main source of IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 during viral infections [10, 11].",

Second, this cell type produces IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, cytokines found to possess a prominent portion of the antiviral function of CD8+ cells during some viral infections [13]. Third, CD8+ cells play a central role in maintenance of the antiviral response by production of chemokines, which modulate the immune response and attract the appropriate leukocyte subsets to the site of infection [2, 14]. The role of CD4+ T cells in antiviral immunity is highly dependent on production of cytokines, notably IFN\u2010\u03b3 [15, 16], and the cytolytic activity exerted by a subset of CD4+ T cells [17].",

The disulfide bonds keep together two domains in the molecule, which are both important for receptor binding and activation [20]. The amino\u2010terminal cysteine residues also form the basis for the systematic classification of chemokines, based on their numbers and mutual placement. The two major groups are CXC chemokines and CC chemokines, both groups having four cysteine residues. In CXC chemokines, the two first cysteine residues are separated by one amino acid, whereas in CC chemokines, the two cysteine residues lie adjacent. Besides the CC and CXC chemokines, there are two minor groups, CX3C and C chemokines, with one and two members, respectively. The CX3C chemokine CX3CL1/neurotactin (murine) or fractalkin (human), which is a membrane\u2010bound glycoprotein, has three residues between the two amino\u2010terminal cysteines, and the C chemokines have only one amino\u2010terminal cysteine residue [18].",

In the group of homing chemokines, conversely, most receptors have only one ligand, although there are exceptions (e.g., CCR7). Chemokine receptors are expressed primarily on leukocytes but also on other cells, e.g., endothelial cells.

Second, chemokines can bind to the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), expressed on erythrocytes and endothelial cells. DARC can bind CC as well as CXC chemokines and may function as a sink, clearing chemokines from the circulation [18]. A third chemokine\u2010binding protein is D6, which binds CC chemokines but not C, CXC, or CX3C chemokines [24].

Although most of this work has been done in vitro, a substantial body of information about chemokine expression in vivo is now available. Table 1 summarizes the data on chemokine expression during viral infection in humans as well as in experimental animals. From the available data, it appears that expression of CC chemokines dominates over the expression of CXC chemokines during viral infections. Among the CC chemokines, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u20101\u03b1 and CCL5/regulated upon activation, normal T cell\u2010expressed and secreted (RANTES) seem to be almost invariably associated with viral infections, with some interesting exceptions. For instance, during an intranasal influenza virus infection in mice, only CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein\u20101 and CXCL10/IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP\u201010) were detected in the lungs at various time\u2010points post\u2010infection, whereas other chemokines including CCL3 and CCL5 were not expressed [36]. By comparison, RSV\u2010infected mice display high levels of expression of numerous chemokines in the lungs, including CCL3 and CCL5 [38]. This observation in mice correlates very well with the results of a comparative study in pediatric patients infected with RSV and influenza virus [45]. Although serum levels of CCL5 were very high in RSV\u2010infected children, this was not the case in influenza virus\u2010infected patients. This difference in chemokine response to these two viruses may be explained by the ability of influenza virus to inhibit various activities of the immune response, in particular the production and activity of IFNs [46].",

Among the CXC chemokines, expression of CXCL10 is found in many viral infections [36, 38, 40, 43]. CXCL10 together with CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN\u2010\u03b3 (MIG) and CXCL11/IFN\u2010inducible T cell \u03b1 chemoattractant constitute the non\u2010ELR CXC chemokines, which all use CXCR3 as receptor [18]. Given the strong activity of this receptor as mediator of T cell recruitment, expression of the non\u2010ELR CXC chemokines may be central for mounting an efficient antiviral response. This idea is supported by the finding of a statistically significant association between intrahepatic expression of CXCL9 and the inflammatory activity of chronic hepatitis C [35]. However, as will be discussed below, CXCL9\u2010 and CXCL10\u2010dependent functions can also lead to excessive immune activation and accompanying immunopathology [47].",

Moreover, although the virus was rapidly cleared from the lungs, CCL5 protein was present up to 1 month after the infection. These findings show that latently infected cells do stimulate the immune system, despite lack of detectable viral replication, and also explains why CD8+ T cells are recruited to TGs latently infected with HSV\u20101 [48].",

Conversely, lack of CCR1 does not affect the ability to clear RSV infections, despite high production of the CCR1 ligand CCL3 [53]. Also, mice deficient in CCL3 exhibit delayed viral clearance when infected with influenza virus, PVM, or MCMV [32, 52, 56]. In an impressive series of studies, Biron and colleagues [32, 33, 61] described the leukocyte\u2010cytokine/chemokine interactions responsible for the antiviral activity of CCL3 in the liver. They identified IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 as the main inducer of CCL3 expression, which in turn, triggered recruitment of NK cells. This cell type subsequently produced IFN\u2010\u03b3, which was then responsible for induction of expression of CXCL9, a chemokine mediating chemotaxis toward T cells [32, 33, 61]. Collectively, the studies discussed above indicate that CCR1 and its ligands are necessary to raise a sufficient immune response against many viruses. In other viral infections, however, CCL3 has been found not to be important for viral clearance. For instance, lack of CCL3 does not affect viral titers after intraperitoneal Coxsackie B3 virus infection, intranasal RSV infection, and ocular HSV\u20101 infection [38, 56, 57]. However, in these cases, CCL3 contributes to the pathology of the infections, as CCL3\u2010deficient mice did not develop myocarditis or keratitis after Coxsackie B3 virus and HSV\u20101 infections, respectively [56, 57], and the CCL3\u2010deficient mice also displayed lower pulmonary inflammation after RSV infection as compared with wild\u2010type mice [38].",

From Table 1 and the discussion in the text, it is apparent that among the chemokines produced during viral infection, notably, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed. Among these, CCL5 is the most studied with respect to molecular mechanisms governing virus\u2010induced chemokine expression. Therefore, the discussion below focuses mainly on CCL5, but we will provide information on other chemokines when available. First, we review the basic principles in virus\u2010cell interactions and virus\u2010activated cellular signal transduction, and subsequently, we discuss the literature on molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of chemokine expression during virus infection.",

Second, viral dsRNA is produced during viral replication and is sensed by the cell through at least two mechanisms: the dsRNA\u2010activated protein kinase (PKR) and Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 3 [67, 68]. Third, overload of viral proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as virus\u2010induced mitochondrial oxidative stress triggers release of calcium from the organelles, which activate kinase cascades, ultimately leading to expression of proinflammatory genes (ref. [69]; and T. H. Mogensen et al., J. Immunol. in press). Finally, some viral proteins have the capacity to specifically activate certain signal\u2010transduction pathways in infected cells [70]. Although it may not seem beneficial for the virus to deliberately activate signal transduction that promotes antiviral defense, the virus may profit from this by stimulating chemokine expression and hence promote recruitment of new cells to infect, which may subsequently relocate and hence support viral spread in the body [71]. Additionally, some viruses harbor sequences in their gene promoters that are recognized by transcription factors, specifically activated by viral proteins [72]. In the literature, each of the above mechanisms has been reported to activate signal\u2010transduction pathways necessary for cytokine and chemokine production [73].",

This phenomenon was recently explained mechanistically by the finding that NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF\u20103/7 synergistically promote CCL5 expression in Sendai virus\u2010infected fibroblastic or myeloid cells [96]. Subsequently, this observation has been demonstrated also to apply to HSV\u2010induced CCL5 expression (J. Melchjorsen and S. R. Paludan, J. Gen. Virol. in press). The ability of NF\u2010\u03baB to act synergistically with IRFs in stimulation of promoter activation has long been appreciated [103]. The above\u2010described, cooperative action of NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF factors bears some resemblance to the mechanisms involved in virus\u2010induced expression of CXCL10. Although differences between the gene promoters of CCL5 and CXCL10 are noticeable, significant similarities are also apparent (Fig. 1). Most notably, both promoters contain a functional ISRE and two NF\u2010\u03baB sites. In fact, as for CCL5, these elements play important roles in regulation of CXCL10 expression during virus infection as well as in response to cytokines [104, 105, 106, 107, 108]. Analysis of the CXCL10 promoter showed that infection with measles virus, NDV, and Sendai virus as well as treatment with dsRNA lead to activation of the wild\u2010type promoter and that this activation is dependent on the region of the promoter encompassing the ISRE and the distal \u03baB site [106, 107]. As these findings were done before the identification of IRF\u20103 and IRF\u20107 as the main virus\u2010activated IRFs, it was not demonstrated which IRF family member is responsible for the ISRE\u2010dependent CXCL10 transcription. However, more recent work has indicated that IRF\u20103 and IRF\u20107 are involved, given the correlation between hantavirus\u2010induced activation of these two transcription factors and expression of CXCL10 [105]. In the same study, cooperation between IRFs and NF\u2010\u03baB was again reported, and this cooperation was found to be enhanced in magnitude and duration by cotreatment with IFN\u2010\u03b3.",

The authors showed that overexpression of the N protein led to activation of the IRF\u20103 kinase, VAK, and subsequent phosphorylation of IRF\u20103. Moreover, the N protein associated with IRF\u20103 as well as VAK, thus indicating that IRF\u20103 or an IRF\u20103\u2010containing protein complex is able to recognize the N protein and transduce this signal to VAK, which in turn, activates IRF\u20103. The ability of capsid proteins to activate IRF\u20103 appears not to be specific to papamyxoviruses, as the capsid protein of the flavivirus West Nile virus also induces expression of CCL5 [118], thus strongly indicating activation of IRF\u20103.

First, the RNA accumulates intracellularly and activates PKR, which in turn, activates the signal transduction leading to degradation of I\u03baB and activation of NF\u2010\u03baB [67]. Second, dsRNA, in intracellular compartments or extracellularly after release from lysed cells, binds to TLR3 and thus activates NF\u2010\u03baB [68]. Studies from this laboratory have shown that HSV infection of macrophages triggers expression of CCL5 and that this relies on PKR, NF\u2010\u03baB, and viral\u2010infected cell protein 0 (ref.

The laboratory of Dr. Muruve [90, 104] has studied the virus\u2010cell interactions responsible for NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 during adenovirus infection. They found that activation of NF\u2010\u03baB was mediated by the viral capsid and was dependent on viral entry. Together, these studies show that many different mechanisms contribute to activation of NF\u2010\u03baB during viral infections, an essential factor in virus\u2010induced chemokine expression.",

The picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus and dsRNA have been demonstrated to activate p38 and JNK through PKR\u2010dependent pathways [124]. Others [125, 126] have subsequently confirmed the involvement of PKR in activation of JNK, whereas some controversy remains with respect to the involvement of PKR in activation of p38 by dsRNA. Virus can also activate p38 through dsRNA\u2010independent mechanisms. For instance, adenovirus has been reported to activate the kinase within 20 min of infection [127], and Muruve and colleagues showed that activation of p38 and ERK by adenovirus was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 or ammonium chloride, suggesting that endosomal escape triggered activation of the MAP kinase pathways. More research is needed to get a better overview of the mechanisms governing activation of MAP kinase pathways during virus infections.",

            "text": "Analysis of the CCL5 promoter reveals at least two additional transcription factor\u2010binding sites potentially involved in regulation of chemokine expression during viral infection, although no direct evidence has been provided yet. First, the GAS element, known to be highly active in response to IFN\u2010\u03b3 [128], may be activated by homodimers of STAT1 formed in response to IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2, which has been shown to stimulate expression of several chemokines [104]. Second, NF\u2010AT is activated during infections with human T lymphotropic virus type 1 and Sendai virus and probably many more [129, 130]. The presence of a NF\u2010AT\u2010binding site in the CCL5 promoter therefore opens up the possibility that this transcription factor might also play a role in virus\u2010induced CCL5 expression. At this point, it is appropriate to mention that in addition to direct virus\u2010induced chemokine expression, cytokines expressed during the course of infection contribute substantially to stimulation of chemokine production, notably at later stages of infection after the initial virus\u2010host interaction. Therefore, promoter elements not directly targeted by virus\u2010activated transcription factors may still contribute to chemokine production during infection. One study by Matikainen et al. [97] showed that influenza A virus infection of human monocytes triggered expression of a number of chemokines, some of which (CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL10) were dependent on intermediary IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 expression. Biron and colleagues [61] also found a role for IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 in virus\u2010induced chemokine expression in the MCMV model, where the authors demonstrated that expression of CCL3 in the liver was induced by type I IFN.",

More recently, chemokines have been ascribed multiple functions, most notably leukocyte activation. Given these properties, it is of little surprise that chemokines contribute significantly to the ability of the organism to mount a proinflammatory response and fight infections. The latter is underscored by the fact that many viruses encode proteins that antagonize chemokine function.",

Investigations of the molecular events that occur during the clinch between the virus and the host cell have revealed that a wealth of mechanisms is involved. These include interactions between viral glycoproteins and cellular surface receptors; accumulation of viral dsRNA, which is sensed by the cell by various mechanisms; cellular stress through protein overload of the endoplasmatic reticulum or production of reactive oxygen intermediated from the mitochondria; and intracellular accumulation of viral proteins that interact with cellular signal transduction.",

The available data seem to support the conclusion that Th1\u2010promoting chemokine receptors and their ligands support viral clearance and in some cases, immunopathology. However, the great degree of redundancy in the chemokine system makes it difficult to predict the role of one specific chemokine or chemokine receptor during infection and hence, emphasizes the importance of thorough experimentation. With the present focus on chemokine receptor antagonists as potential treatment against HIV infections and chronic inflammatory diseases, it is important to fully understand the role of these receptors in defense against infections. Moreover, in\u2010depth understanding of the chemokine system may in turn allow development of vaccines and immunostimulatory drugs as treatment against virus infections in immunocompromised hosts prone to opportunistic infections.",
