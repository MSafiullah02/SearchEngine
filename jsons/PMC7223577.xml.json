Operating rooms and anesthesia machines1 are being repurposed to care for these critically ill patients. Certain ICU ventilators, such as the Hamilton G5 (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland), permit their control monitor to be detached from the ventilator and extended outside the room on an umbilical electrical cable, which allows \u201cfrequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff.\u201d2 Although no studies have examined effects on clinical outcomes, the pragmatic benefits are evident: ICU staff need not be continuously present in the patient\u2019s room, nor frequently don and doff scarce personal protective equipment to perform alarm checks and setting changes.",

Three cables attach to the control panel, marked A, B, and C in figure 1 and inset. Loosening these bolts and cables allows the control panel to be detached. A is a DB15/male cable, which communicates with the electronic medical record. B is an HD26/male cable, which carries ventilator signals and data. C is a DB15/female cable, which provides system power.4 We have added and tested 50-foot extensions to cables A, B, and C, permitting the detached control panel to be repositioned outside the operating room. Figure 1 (right) shows the remote control and monitoring of the ventilation of a mannequin within an operating room converted for ICU care. The cable extensions used were Amphenol Corporation 2 \u00d7 Part #CS-DSDMDB15MF for A and C, and Part #CS-DSDHD26MF0 for B (Amphenol Cables On Demand, USA). When the anesthesia machine is returned to normal service, removing these extensions reverts the machine to its original configuration without a trace.",

If B becomes disconnected, the control panel will display a system malfunction screen (fig. 2) and alarm audibly. If C becomes disconnected, the control panel will power down abruptly, and audible machine alarms will sound. To restart ventilator operation after disconnection of B or C, power down, reconnect the cable, and power up while manually ventilating as shown.",
