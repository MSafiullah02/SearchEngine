            "text": "In recent years, it has become evident that there is a great need to develop in vitro methods allowing to analyze human B cell responses in order to understand their regulation in normal as well as pathological situation such as autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiency, and infection diseases (1). One of the main limitations is that mature B cells, na\u00efve as well as memory, cannot be maintained efficiently in vitro. When B cells are cultured in vitro in the presence of CD40 ligand (CD40L), cytokines, BCR triggering and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists they do respond. However, as soon as the B cells respond they differentiate into terminal plasma cells (2). This process is accompanied by cell cycle arrest precluding the generation of long-term B cell lines. Recently, transduction of peripheral memory B cells with the transcriptional factors involved in the control of B cell proliferation and differentiation, B cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xl) and BCL-6, respectively, has allowed to immortalize and generate stable cell lines expressing BCR and are able to synthesize and secrete immunoglobulins (3).",

We have used this method to isolate neutralizing as well as non-neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (11). These antibodies have been generated from one individual, who recovered from SARS infection. The obtained antibodies display a high in vitro potency to neutralize viral replication. This approach is not only applicable to the area of infectious diseases but also other clinical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer, and allows exploiting the breadth and the avidity of the human B cell repertoire (12, 13). The method consists of four sequential steps: (a) human B cell subset isolation, (b) EBV infection, (c) B cell cloning, and (d) screening (Fig. 1).\n",

All antibodies, which bind to a given antigen can be measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Alternatively, if the specific antigen can be expressed in the plasma membrane of a given cell line upon transfection of the relevant gene the binding of the antibody to the cell surface can be \u00adevaluated in flow cytometry. The ability to neutralize the specific pathogen in vitro is another possible measurement of antibody function.\nAdd 70 \u03bcL antigen resuspended in coating buffer per well (final concentration 10 \u03bcg/mL) in ELISA plates and incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C or 4 h at RT.Wash 3\u00d7 with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20.Add 200 \u03bcL of blocking solution PBS 10% FCS, 2 h RT.Wash 3\u00d7 with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20.Add 50 \u03bcL of B cell supernatant, incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C.Wash 3\u00d7 with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20.Add 50 \u03bcL of anti-Ig-alkaline phosphatase 1/500 in PBS 10% FCS, 2 h at RT.Wash 3\u00d7 with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20.Add 100 \u03bcL of ELISA substrate 104.Read at absorbance of 405 nm in ELISA reader.\n",

            "text": "\nThe number of B cells obtained from peripheral blood varies greatly between different donors. Percentage of peripheral B lymphocytes can range from 5 to 12% and this is age dependent. Usually elder people have fewer B cells. In order to minimize the loss of B cells, it is better to process the blood as soon as possible. Anti-coagulant such as heparin must be used. It is crucial to keep B cells on ice during all the different steps. Depletion of platelets form peripheral blood (800 rpm  \u00d7  8 min), avoid the formation of clumps and aggregates. Also see Current Protocols in Immunology, Unit 7.1, April 2009.These columns separate 1  \u00d7  108 magnetically labeled cells from up to 109. Smaller or larger column are also available. Alternatively an automated column separator (e.g., autoMACS, Miltenyi) can be used.In order to obtain a pure B cell population, it is necessary to use a positive selection method with immunomagnetic beads, followed by cell sorting. The positive selection method has the advantage that B cells are isolated with high degree of purity. However, unless Fab antibodies are used there is also the theoretical disadvantage that cells bearing high affinity Fc recep-tors (monocytes), may bind to the antibodies. In addition, the antibodies utilized to select B cells, such as anti-surface Ig could provide a signal to the B cell that can influence the EBV infection. Indeed in all the antibodies combinations mentioned in Table 1 the surface Ig is used to negatively select the B cell population. Moreover, it is crucial to use anti-CD22 or CD20 microbeads to enrich B cells, instead of anti-CD19 microbeads. The latter induces the internalization of CD19 surface and consequently also of CD21, which is responsible for EBV entry into B cells (14).Make sure that B95.8 do not grow in big clusters, some cells adhere to the plastic, and are intolerant to acid conditions. It is crucial to split them every 2 days with a 1/2 or 1/3 dilution factor. The goal is to gradually expand these cells to obtain the needed amount, which depends on the size of the infection you plan to perform. When the desired volume is reached, all cells maintenance procedures (including medium change) are stopped.\n",
