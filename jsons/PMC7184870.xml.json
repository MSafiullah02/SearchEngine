The comic must be at least three panels. Show cause and effect with the comics form. Each panel should build off the previous panels. You must show a progression or story or chronology. Here you must encapsulate different scenes from history we learned about. You can look at a specific event, or events over a much longer period of time. Part of understanding history is understanding a sense of chronology. In addition, with this assignment, I am trying to get you to think of which events to show and omit. Similar to the notion of encapsulation, historians must make this decision all the time.You must utilize facial expressions and body language to convey moods and feelings. For example, how might a lower class person might have felt upon entering a school for the first time?Use color to convey mood.After you finish the strip, write a justification of the facial expressions, scene choice, how the scenes are related and colors used. Why did you pick these scenes and colors and expressions? Be specific!\n",

Regarding the stretching aspect noted above, one student depicted the instruction and education of African Americans from their arrival in America in 1619, through the nineteenth century and up until the 1954 Brown decision. The student had to weave a number of chronological but distant events together. Note: For the exercise below, the instructor can assign a historical topic or let students chose. For the purposes of this book, I have assigned a topic which has many causes: the Common School movement in America. I could also have used the First World War or the French Revolution. In addition, this may be an assignment where the teacher might want to provide an example. Cabero (2019) is a nice accessible article which talks about multilinearity and multidirectionality. Cromer and Clark (2007) specifically talk about the comics form and the study of history. In addition, Sousanis\u2019 (2015b) graphic novel would work well here too. These resources could be given to students prior to this assignment. In the appendix, some of my own graphic novels make use of some of these notions. I would show this to my class and use this as an example. Teachers could also find other historical graphic novels and show interesting page configurations as examples.",

The use of comics can help us visualize this messiness.First, view the excerpts from Sousanis and Cabero. Consider how the comics page, specifically the directionality and multilinear aspect, can be used to visually represent the multiple causes and motivations of the Common School Movement.Consider the different page configurations first (from question 1). How can you use different patterns and configurations to show the various motivations, obstacles, and founders of the Common School Movement?Some examples and different ideas to consider: You could use a circular or swirling pattern, you can have a page with overlapping panels, you can have some events in panels and some out of panels, you can invert the reading order (right to left, up and down), you can have two stories happening (one from right to left another up and down).Think also of what scenes you will need to encapsulate and what text, if any, you will have.\n\n",

I thought this formulation truly showed a nonlinear take on some of the complexities of the Common School Movement. In one box, my students wrote that immigrants had to walk 10 miles to school. When I reviewed the assignment, I questioned them about this piece of information, it seemed excessive. After hearing my student\u2019s justification, I decided to leave it, despite my initial reservations. I believe my student was trying to make a point about the plight of immigrants.

Field trips can be wonderful opportunities, but teachers must exercise great care and planning, as well as make sure field trips are meaningful and related to instruction (Banks et al., 1999). As noted earlier, and as it pertains to local history, Marino and Crocco (2012) posit that examining larger themes and situating a locality in those themes can be fruitful. For this assignment, students are to go to a historical site and create a short sequence of events that took place at the site. This could also be done with the use of a virtual field trip (Chapin, 2015). Of course, the teacher will need discretion here because different sites will require different types of sequences (so, the sequence drawn at the Battle of Gettysburg site will look different than the sequence at the Brown versus Board of Education site). The next question has students draw a large circle around the sequence (large enough to draw more pictures inside). Inside the circle, students are then to draw wider themes that were affecting American society. The point here is to think beyond the event and situate the event\u2014visually\u2014in those larger themes. I also think that this exercise can at least touch on the notions of nonlinear considerations, as well as demonstrate nonconventional reading patterns.

For each comic, give some examples of how it might reflect larger cultural trends. Use the text and pictures to serve as examples of wider trends which you have read about and studied in class.Read the excerpt from Jenkins (2014). Look through the comics you selected for question 1. In addition, look through the excerpts from these important Batman comics: The Killing Joke, Batman White Knight, Morrison Comics, etc. as well as any other Batman comics that are relevant. Read fan blogs, letters to the editor, etc. (see: http://www.42entertainment.com/work/whysoserious and https://numberonebatfan.wordpress.com/ as examples). Read the conference proceedings to the Batman in Popular Culture Conference. You can visit the DC Comics website to better understand the characters in the Batman universe.Now, use the Batman mythos and its shared meanings to critique some aspect of society. Here, think of the Batman universe as a \u201cmap,\u201d which can show where the flaws in our own society exist. Use the shared meanings of the Batman Universe to accomplish this task.\n",

First, to see it as a mirror of our own society, and secondly, to use it as a map to critique existing society. I created an example of a map or the practice of cultural acupuncture. Fans have presence and power, they discuss comics, and they can be political. This assignment utilizes these ideas. For my example, I worked from Alan Moore and Brian Bolland\u2019s The Killing Joke and utilized the Joker to make a political critique. Of course, I am not the first to do this. A Google search of \u201cUncle Sam Joker\u201d yields a number of different images and variations, some with comic covers featuring the Joker in that position. Wessels and Martinez (2015) examine how many in the Tea Party movement utilized the image of the Joker to critique what they saw as shortcomings of the Obama presidency. In addition, Heldenfels (2015) argues for a Marxist reading of the Joker, while Litsey (2015) views the Joker in Nietzchean terms. The point is that there are a number of political and/or philosophical arguments that can be made of the Joker. As a fan, I utilized elements of the Batman universe to make my political points. So, I situate my analyses of the Joker in this context.",

I utilized the page when Joker becomes the Joker. He just finished his swim in the toxic chemicals. I kept the same overall panel structure and layout. But, I \u201cmapped\u201d what I saw as Joker\u2019s transformation (into the Joker) and his nihilism to aspects of American government and society. In the background of the first panel, I have the capitol building. I changed the last panel of the page, the panel where we see the Joker for the first time. Instead of Joker running his hands through his hair, I have the Joker dressed as Uncle Sam, pointing at the reader with a hideous smile. There are also newspapers swirling around with images of the military and the stock market. I used specific images for this mapping. I used the Capitol Building to symbolize government and politics (I made a deliberate choice to use the capitol building and not the White House, as I wanted this to be a bipartisan critique), I used Uncle Sam Joker to criticize the transformation of our government. I also have written new words in the panels which read: We are watching/the transformation/of democracy/into/a joke/or maybe/its just returning/to its natural state/maybe/this is the truth. I saw Joker and his transformation as a symbol of our own democracy. I was trying to convey the notion that our republic is a joke, or transforming into a joke. But this transformation may really be its natural state revealing itself. Of course readers can interpret these words any way they want. There is also obvious crossover with the symbolism and imagery in this chapter, and this assignment could plausibly have been included in the next chapter.",

This can be a fun exercise (which I undertook at the conference). Below, I have listed some ideas. Batman is a vigilante, and as such, he breaks the law. However, this situation could be used as a way to discuss political theory, specifically legitimate government as posed by John Locke. In a nutshell, citizens have a responsibility to follow the dictates of their government when that government is legitimate. Governments are legitimate when they uphold the citizens\u2019 natural rights of life, liberty, and property and these governments require the obedience of the people (Uzgalis, 2019). If the government does not uphold these rights, its end of the social contract, citizens can revolt (Gutek, 1995; Uzgalis, 2019). Perhaps the government of Gotham City is not upholding their end of the contract because it does not protect the citizens, and Batman is a type of revolution.",

How can you rework the elements of the story to say something about our own culture and society? You can hug the story closely or deviate. But the basic story should be of someone trying to get back to someone and facing a number of obstacles. Write a brief description.Take the description you wrote in question three and use it to create a thumbnail of at least five sequential panels.
