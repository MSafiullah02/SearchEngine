Strategies include among others, improving routine MMR coverage among children below 2 years of age, implementing supplementary vaccination activities for older children and adolescents (aged 6-13 years) and strengthening disease surveillance. Following implementation of the elimination plan, national vaccination coverage for first MMR dose in children at two years of age increased from 82.0% in 2003, to 89.6% in 2007.

It is likely that isolation measures and separate admission procedures were not always adopted in case of admission of a patient with signs and symptoms compatible with measles. In the first outbreak, nosocomial transmission may have been responsible for the spread of the infection from the Roma/Sinti to the Italian population. Also of concern is the fact that four healthcare professionals developed measles. As the incidence of measles declines, nosocomial transmission is likely to become an important source of infection and sustain the occurrence of outbreaks among non-immunised health staff and hospital contacts, representing a serious problem in the elimination of measles [26].

The implementation of catch up campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults should also be considered, with the additional objective of protecting women of childbearing age against rubella.",
