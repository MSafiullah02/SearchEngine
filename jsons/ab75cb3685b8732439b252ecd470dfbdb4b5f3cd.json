Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients at our institution undergoing PB haplo-HCT with PTCy between June 2009 and June 2015. Infections were microbiologically confirmed. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) classified as \"proven\" or \"probable\" by standard definitions were included. Results: In total, 104 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 218 days (range: 6-1576). A total of 322 episodes of infection were recorded. Eighty-nine percent of patients experienced at least one infection. Median time to first infection was 22 days. Patients experiencing at least one bacterial, viral, and IFI were 62%, 72%, and 6%, respectively. The majority (69%) of bacterial infections were caused by enteric organisms. Seven cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection were recorded, with one bacteremia case.

First, by excluding suspected infections that were not microbiologically confirmed, we underestimate the true incidence of infection in our population. Febrile episodes with no identified organism are a common occurrence in this population. 33 Furthermore, many patients with suspected pneumonia cannot undergo bronchoscopy owing to thrombocytopenia. However, by employing strict criteria, our results are more specific than relying on retrospective clinical judgment. Second, our study did not include a comparison group. This makes contextualizing the reported rates of infection more difficult, especially given regional variations in some pathogens. However, it also allows us to provide an extremely broad and comprehensive description of the infectious experience within this novel cohort. Pathogen-specific comparative studies are a direction of future research and may help illuminate differences in immune reconstitution following haplo-HCT when compared to more traditional donors. Third, we were limited to collecting data from our own medical records system. Generally, patients receive all transplantrelated care at our institution. In the case of acute illness, some patients likely received treatment closer to home and these episodes would not be captured in this study.
