The high and imminent mortality means issues such as eventual chronic fibrosis development may be secondary considerations compared to immediate restoration of lung function, specifically adequate blood oxygenation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, given as early as possible where infection is known or suspected to be present, as is support of gas exchange, usually via assisted ventilation or in more severe cases, if available, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support [18] . The core treatment of ARDS is based on supportive measures that primarily aim at gaining time to allow the antibiotic treatment or the patient immunologic system to defeat the primary cause of ARDS. Mechanical ventilation strategy includes: the use of low tidal volume ventilation, inspiratory pressure, higher positive end expiratory pressure and using prone positioning, and administering neuromuscular blockers in higher severity ARDS [19] [20] [21] . Current guidelines supporting protective mechanical ventilation is aimed at preventing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury [22] in patients with ARDS. The pathophysiologic reason behind this is based on the concept of the \"baby lung\" [23] , which has reduced compliance caused by the severe decrease of lung aerated volumes, and is defined based on CT scans over the course of initial ARDS diagnosis (0-7 days) and the subsequent fibroproliferative response (15-20 days) [24, 25] .",

A wide variety of anti-inflammatory pharmacologicals, proteins, and antibodies have demonstrated promise in the laboratory but have failed in clinical trial (reviewed in [34] ). Of relevance here is the fact that injury and repair responses are intimately linked phenomena at the cell signaling and transcriptional level, and blanket inhibition of inflammation may delay or even prevent essential regenerative processes that restore lung tissue to normal function [35] [36] [37] . An idealistic treatment of ARDS should target multiple mechanisms and biologic pathways instead of aiming at a single exclusive target. This hypothesis is supported by: (1) the heterogeneity of the mechanisms involved in the lung injury, (2) decades of negative randomized clinical trials with pharmacologic and other therapies and (3) the new upcoming evidences about the role of biologically distinct pathways and response to treatment in specific subsets of ARDS patientsas recently observed by the identification of specific endotypes and phenotypes [38] [39] [40] .",

Considering that a match among clinical signs and pathology findings is far from being perfect, it is relevant that DAD is highly associated to the category of nonresolving ARDS [45] and that DAD predicts higher mortality in ARDS compared to patients with non-DAD ARDS [46] . Excess alveolar fluid blocks gas exchange at the alveolar epithelial surface, while surfactant inactivation by infiltrating albumin and other substances [47] [48] [49] damages fluid tension leading to alveolar collapse. Even for patients undergoing ventilation, eventually ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch occurs where oxygen delivered to the pulmonary space fails to reach the bloodstream and there is impairment of CO 2 clearance, leading to systemic hypoxemia and hypercapnia. At the cellular and molecular level, the initial phase of ARDS arising from pulmonary infection involves resident pulmonary macrophage defenses being overcome, and the epithelial cell layer lining the alveolus begins to produce proinflammatory cytokines [50] . These signals initiate the recruitment of circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and B-cells, to migrate up a chemokine concentration gradient to the lung tissue, where these cells release matrix metalloproteinases that enzymatically digest connective tissue facilitating entry to the airspace [51] . Recruited infiltrating cells produce a wide range of noxious substances including superoxide radicals [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] , leukotrienes [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] , and antimicrobial peptides [65] [66] [67] and further cytokine cocktails in an attempt to destroy the infectious agents. In ARDS, a section of these substances is uncontrolled and induce damage to the lung tissue itself leading to fluid buildup and surfactant loss. Finally as the alveoli fill with liquid and the integrity of the epithelial and endothelial barrier is compromised, gas exchange deteriorates and hypoxemia and hypercapnia result. In later phases of ARDS during systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), patients may suffer from functional immune-suppression and have heightened susceptibility to additional infection [68] [69] [70] . While ARDS presents an acute onset after the exposure to the causing factor, its evolving process starts with acute exudation and infiltrates of acute inflammatory cells into the alveoli within 1 week. During the second week a subacute deposition of collagen fibers are produced by fibroblasts. The syndrome typically resolves through a chronic stage characterized by alveolar macrophage infiltration into the alveoli and a fibrotic repairing process of the lung parenchyma [11] .",

As further conditions are likely to have MSCs licenses as a medicinal therapeutic, this will be of added relevance where MSC therapy may be employed in the same patient for sequential separate disease instances. MSCs accumulate in the lungs initially after IV administration [75] [76] [77] and can remain viable there for up to 24 h [78] after which this time MSCs disappear, suggesting any therapeutic effect has already been conferred to the host; however, it is not clear what happens to MSCSs after they have left the lungs.

Indeed, many of the leukocyte subpopulations involved in ARDS pathology have been shown to have direct interaction with MSCs [87] [88] [89] , while direct antibacterial activity [65] is to be considered an added bonus. Also, the fact that most patients with ARDS require tracheal intubation to permit support of lung function opens up the possibility of direct delivery to the lung airspace of MSC or MSC derivatives [90] , although since patients are also almost certain to have IV access obtained and there have been, to date, no demonstrated efficacy advantages observed in delivery of MSC intratracheally over IV [91] in ARDS models, this remains a point of urgent future investigation.",

Fluid balance was normalized by the decrease of the extravascular lung water, restoring the alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and by improvement of lung endothelial barrier permeability. The alveolar epithelial fluid transport was in part coordinated by the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), secreted by the MSCs, which restored the correct function of the amiloride-dependent sodium transport.",

In 2014, it was observed in a follow-on study that intravenous administration of clinical-grade allogenic human MSCs could increase the AFC at 4 h. The role of KGF in the AFC was confirmed by the study of a neutralizing antibody of KGF that could decrease the AFC activity [94] . Recently, the same group explored the effects of microvesicles (MVs) released by human mesenchymal stem cells in their established ex vivo human lung perfusion model of bacterial pneumonia. The investigators reported positive results highlighting the beneficial effects of MSC MVs in increasing lung antibody forming cells, in decreasing the lung permeability, and improving the bacterial clearance, particularly when MSCs were pre-treated before isolation of MVs with a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) [95] .",

Therefore autologous MSC administration is considered a viable therapeutic option as the likelihood of an immune response is extremely low. The routes of administration will influence the MSCs ability to differentiate, their immunogenic MSCs have been demonstrated to alleviate the pathophysiological symptoms of ARDS through the secretion of paracrine factors, cell-to-cell contact and mitochondrial transfer (TNT and EV release). Indirect and direct contact of MSCs has been shown to reduce the permeability of alveolar epithelium and increase fluid clearance. Through the secretion of ANG-1, endothelial and epithelial repair is increased. Reduction of neutrophil migration also improves endothelial and epithelial barri-ers. Release of KGF promotes an increase in alveolar fluid clearance. Bacteria clearance is achieved through the direct release of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 or through increased phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages mediated by the release of cytokines including FGF-7 or by transfer of micro vesicles through TNTs. Mitochondrial transfer to epithelial cells also increases surfactant release. A few mechanisms of action of MSCS in ARDS have been displayed in this diagram. EVs extracellular vesicles, TNT Tunnelling Nanotubules, ANG-1 angiopoietin-1, PGE2 prostaglandin E2, KGF keratinocyte growth factor, LL-37 peptide \u03b2-cathelicidin effect, and ultimately their survival [97] . Some studies have contradicted the MSC's proposed ability to evade immunological detection. MHC II protein expression analysis on MSCs has been shown to be higher than originally documented [98] [99] [100] . In vivo studies have also shown that allogenic MSCs are not immune privileged and have the potential to cause an immune response, while other research has contradicted findings and stated MSCs are immune privileged [101] [102] [103] [104] .",

It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to alveolar epithelial cells improved survival after endotoxin injury [118] , while in a rat model of COPD, iPS-derived MSC mitochondrial transfer to bronchial epithelial cells was also observed [126] . MSCs have been shown to transfer mitochondria to macrophages in vitro and in vivo, improving macrophage function and enhancing phagocytosis [127] . In a mouse model of E. coli-induced pneumonia it was reported that therapeutic effect was dependent on transfer of MSC mitochondria to alveolar macrophages through TNT, enhancing antimicrobial activity and phagocytosis [128] . While it is unclear whether the mechanism of action in vivo is due to an enhancement of a normal mitochondrial function or restoration of dysfunctional mitochondria, there is some evidence for damaged mitochondrion, e.g., downregulated NDUFB8 (complex I) and ATP synthase (complex V), in ARDS meaning the latter is a distinct possibility [129, 130] .",

The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs is affected by cryopreservation, launching a heat shock protein response [141] . In vivo experiments have shown that cryopreserved are less well tolerated. In a clinical application where predominant indications included graft versus host disease (GvHD) and tissue injury in hemorrhagic cystitis, therapeutic properties of freezethawed and freshly harvested MSCs were compared. A 100% response rate was observed in patients treated with fresh cells at a low passage compared to patients treated with cryopreserved freeze-thawed cells at a higher passage, with cryopreserved MSCs eliminated faster by compliment after exposure to recipient blood [140] . The thawing process can damage cell surface proteins and this abnormality attracts the binding of complement initiating clearance by phagocy-tosis [142] [143] [144] . After complement exposure, there is an 80% decrease in cell viability in cryopreserved cells compared to a 50% decrease in fresh MSCs [141, 145] . However activation of complement may not be negative as recognition of opsonized MSCs are hypothesized to induce an M2 phenotype, producing anti-inflammatory mediators [140] . Macrophages can display various phenotypes, with the two being described as M1 and M2. M1 phenotypes are generated by the classical pathway [146, 147] and produce abundant inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-12, and reactive oxygen species. M2 phenotypes are generally activated by the alternative pathway and express a variety of lectins, protein, and scavenger receptors [146] [147] [148] .",

Additionally, there is currently no data published on whether there is an upper limit on MSC population doubling that still retains therapeutic efficacy. Kern et al. compared the senescence ratio of AT-MSC to BM-MSC and found that BM-MSC had a growth threshold of passage 7, whereas AT-MSC had a threshold of 8 [154] , but efficacy itself may be lost long before senescence arises. In addition, MSCs isolated from patients with advanced age [155, 156] , diabetes [157] , rheumatoid arthritis [158] , or indeed ARDS itself [159] have decreased activity, including lower regenerative and differential potential and therefore autologous MSC therapy in patients with significant chronic comorbidities may not be a promising approach in any case. Downregulation of inflammatory marker receptors may render MSCs isolated from such patients less responsive to the injury microenvironment and hence of lower overall therapeutic value [146, 147, 159] .",

There are also, variations in age related to DNA methylation levels, which is correlated to differential abilities, with ESCderived iPSC having a higher proliferation and regenerative capacity [166, 167] . However, caution is still required as genetic abnormalities remain an area of concern in iPSCs [168] . Clinical studies using iPSCs found some cells in the study contained genetic abnormalities, and were consequently not used.

After an initial dose confirmation phase (n = 6), Athersys confirmed the tolerability and the safety profile of the MultiStem \u00ae treatment (n = 20) with no adverse events during administration, and lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers compared to the control group (n = 10). Furthermore, despite the study was not powered for efficacy outcomes, MultiStem \u00ae cell therapy was associated with better short term prognosis, as shown by a lower mortality rate (25% versus 40%), higher ventilator-free (12.9 versus 9.2) and ICUfree days (10.3 versus 8.1) compared to control. Further findings will be unveiled at end of the collection of the 1-year follow-up data, as aimed according to the study design.

Preclinical studies typically use between 1 \u00d7 10 6 and 10 \u00d7 10 6 MSCs per kg of bodyweight or ideal bodyweight of the patient, and clinical trials have been designed with these doses in mind. In light of the observed relatively low cell viability in ongoing trials, production of the order of 10 9 MSC may be required to reach the upper doses when allowance for dead cells is calculated. Coupled with the lack of information with regard to passage or population doubling at which efficacy is lost, this will likely necessitate pooled donor batches to enter the MSC isolation and production process. Considerable work is being concentrated on this area both academically and industrially to optimize and automate, including the utilization of xeno-free media that allays fears of contamination with viruses or other as yet unknown contaminating factors. The preponderance of preclinical work with MSCs has involved freshly harvested MSCs and this will remain an impractical and unlikely therapeutic for the clinic. Despite the development of rapid shipping solutions from manufacturing facility to clinical site, and research into supportive media to extend the MSCs' effective lifespan in suspension prior to administration, it is probable that a cryopreserved MSC will become the choice in the long term. Cryopreservation at the clinical site or expedited transport from manufacturing facilities will be required, but it remains to be determined what further equipment such as centrifuges and viability assessment assays will be needed to prepare the MSC dose and allow quality control prior to administration to the patient.",

Indeed several studies that have sought to replicate the various mechanisms proposed through administration of MSC-produced factors have failed or not reproduced the efficacy of the MSC itself, indicating critical gaps in our knowledge of MSC action in ARDS and suggesting interpretation of unsuccessful or even successful follow on clinical trial will be difficult.
