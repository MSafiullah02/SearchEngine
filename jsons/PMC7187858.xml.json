This means patients who need a face-to-face appointment can still be treated as a priority.3.Non-emergency, planned 'elective' surgeries at hospitals have been postponed and visiting and access arrangements have also been adapted to make sure safety is paramount at this time.4.Deployment of vascular juniors with different set of skills might come useful to support intensive care setting and emergency admissions.5.Extension into vascular theatres or operating rooms to allow space for the increasingly number of critical admissions, meant that majority of ventilatory support equipment have to be utilised for admitted case load.\n",

Hospitals limiting their operating rooms and theatres to only emergency cases will over inflate the scale of future elective work which the majority will turn into progressively emergency work in the immediate effect. The scale of this conversion would bring and produce extra duties, worn-out teams to meet the demands in changes of the service configurations, rerouting and prioritization of emerging cases and not to forget the pressure on existing services. This picture would be compounded in our specialty that is in dire need of taskforce. Consequentially, this will burden further any cost-effective models which are in place albeit in radiology streams, different surgical disciplines which would likely follow pursuit including orthopedics, general surgery and surely onco-surgery.",
