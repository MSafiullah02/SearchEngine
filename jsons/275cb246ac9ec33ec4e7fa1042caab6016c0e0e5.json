The groups that include the segments of the two pandemic viruses, Russia 1977 and Mexico 2009, are termed R and M, respectively, with U being the remaining group. As the distances among the groups are similar in all segments, they were placed similarly on the plots (Fig. S2) . Variations in the rotation angle of the triangle were caused by differences in the number of samples among the groups. Fig. S2 includes several very old strains: the 1918 and 1943 human pandemic strains (green) and the 1930 swine strains (grey); they showed a tendency to be located closer to the origin of the plot. The magnitudes of PCs were similar among the segments, showing that the groups were separated by similar distances. This suggests a constant mutation rate among the segments, which might be branched from the ancestral strain coincidentally as a new set of viruses. The complete separations observed negate the possibility of homologous recombination between viruses, which would yield some intermediates among the groups. Those of the 1930 swine strain may be an exception among the intermediates, which will be discussed below.",

Thus, avian viruses had sequences that were similar to the average among samples at amino acids that were characteristic to the three groups of human and swine viruses: R, M, and U. Avian samples also showed characteristic motifs at other positions, which may appear in lower PCs. The relationships observed among the strains presented here are different from the classic ones 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] in several elements. For example, the number of swine classes was conspicuous. Previously, \"triple reassortant\", \"Eurasian avian-like, \" and \"classic\" viruses were estimated 8 . However, the triple-reassortant group was absorbed into the two groups, U and M, and the sorting differed among segments in the strains presented here (Fig. S2 , blue, Table 1 ). The frequency of shifts detected was another of the differences detected; i.e., only a few shifts were estimated 4, 8, 9, 13 . These may be derived from differences in the classification methods used, which will be discussed below.",

They were changed slightly by drifting and were detected in another area in the subsequent year (Figs. 2D and S5). As the lives of humans span several decades, they might be immune to viruses that appeared in the past. This may represent a selective pressure to viruses. Moreover, humans may travel to other countries by air while carrying viruses. Hence, the viruses spread worldwide, unifying the outbreaking strains. Although changes in one to several residues may be sufficient to escape specific antibody defenses 1 , humans have various antibodies that target different epitopes. The drifts that occur within a year would be insufficient for viral spread in the same district; hence, H1 outbreaks occurring in two consecutive years were rare (Figs. 2D and S5).

Many variations were present coincidently in any given year, especially in recent years, when the sequences became available from various areas. Such a variety may hide the effects of drifts from higher axes of the PCA. In fact, the PC values formed horizontal rows in the plots. However, the variations detected in an area did not change much, even in lower PC axes (Fig. S4B,C) . The small changes may result from differences in the districts that were surveyed in specific years, rather than from those caused by drifts. Moreover, strains that may be transmitted from humans to swine were detected several years after the human epidemics; this may have occurred if the strains were kept unchanged among swine (Fig. 3A,B) . These observations suggest that livestock viruses are rather conserved. Each district may keep its own set of a virus library and we may be observing only a limited portion of the variation. The conserved character of these viruses suggests the presence of a weaker Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:19287 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55254-z www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ selective pressure for newer epitopes.

Here, we presented views that are very different from those of previous studies. The discrepancies were generated by differences in the methodologies, because many of the data analysed were common among studies. Here, we wish to show that our study has better falsifiability 6 . A sequence matrix is essentially composed of multivariate data with a large number of dimensions 6 . Previous studies used tree-based models (Fig. 1) which can handle only a single dimension 7 ; such tree models have to ignore the real data structure. The understanding of clusters requires advanced judgement calls; hence, it may fail easily and the comparison of the results of different segments or types is difficult. In contrast, PCA does not have limitations regarding the shape of presentations or the number of dimensions; thus, it has better objectivity 6 . For instance, the attributions of clusters presented in Figs. 1C and S2 should not cause confusion. Moreover, the assumption that \"the relationship among samples should be a tree-like structure\" cannot be verified. Our analyses are free from such assumptions. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ One of the major differences observed was the direct shift from avian to swine or human viruses. Although these shifts were thought to explain the 1918 5,13,16 and 2009 8, 9, 11 pandemic viruses, the segments of avian viruses were separated from any swine or human segments, even those that were thought to be close to the source (Fig. S2 , A, orange) 17 . Therefore, it is difficult to estimate such direct shifts. In fact, the cluster called \"triple reassortant\" disappeared (Fig. 2S) ; this class was detected as a pandemic swine H3N2 virus 17 and also presented some clusters of H1N1 8, 9, 11 . Although avian viruses might be the origin of the H1 viruses, they might have a limited capacity to infect swine or humans, and vice versa. Among the samples studied here, there was only one example of such transmittance, which may have occurred from humans to turkeys (NCBI taxonomy ID: 1848980) in contrast to the occasional transmittance observed between humans and swine ( Figs. 1C and 4A,B) . The three groups, R, M, and U, may have branched out from the origin to achieve better infectivity in swine or humans (Fig. 5) . The 1943 human strain may represent an earlier process of branching out (Fig. S2 ). Swine may be the origin of the 1918 pandemic virus, i.e., the 1930 swine strain may be a derivative of this group of viruses.",

The livestock strains differed among districts and remained constant for years. The conservative nature of these viral sequences may be attributed to the short life-span of livestock. As they rarely live for a year, they are not immune to viruses that spread over the previous year. Hence, these viruses are not under a selective pressure toward the formation of newer epitopes. Likely, a conservative character was also found in our preliminary studies of human infection with filoviruses and coronaviruses (not shown). Moreover, because livestock rarely move around, the area of viral transmission is limited. For example, even the very infectious pandemic avian virus of 2004 was unable to spread worldwide. Instead, it infected a limited number of farms 2 . This limitation precludes a competition among strains, which enabling the maintenance of unique strains in small, separate areas. Some of the strains that are retained may include segments that spread among humans in the past. It is even possible that several human viruses are kept intact among swine. Such collections may be the source of the 1977 pandemic virus, which is thought to be a frozen laboratory strain that was released accidentally 4, 18 .",

            "text": "It is obvious that any strain that has caused an outbreak will not appear again for decades among humans. In contrast to the case of the H3N2 viruses, H1N1 outbreaks rarely occur in two consecutive seasons (Figs. 2D and  S5 ). This shows that most people exposed to the virus are infected asymptomatically during the viral outbreak and become immune; otherwise, the virus could infect a portion of receptive people that were not infected in the previous year. Also, the drift occurring in a single year is insufficient for escaping the immune system. The pdm09 virus appeared after the flu season and spread worldwide from April 2009 to March 2010 (Fig. S5) . The extraordinary infectivity of this virus may have been caused by epitopes that were new to humans. Therefore, the present system of vaccine production to control influenza infections, which uses eggs, has a critical defect: i.e., none of the stock strains that are used for viral production are the one that will cause an outbreak in the following season. The population might have become immune to the stock viruses and the vaccine just helps to recall the memory of these strains.",

Data pertaining to amino acid sequences were used to observe multiple subtypes or hosts (Figs. 1 and 2) , while nucleotide sequences were used for specific subtypes (Figs. 3-5, S5 and S6). Data alignment was performed using MUSCLE 20 . All the aligned sequences are presented in Figs S1, S2 and S4. The sequence matrix was casted to direct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 6 , which analyses sequence matrix without losing any of original information in the matrix 6 , using R 21 . The direct PCA is resistant to differences caused by the alignment: differences in the conditions or the alignment methods may not alter the results practically 6 . The sequence matrix were translated into a Boolean vector X; for n samples of l bases, X is a matrix of n \u00d7 5 l, which correspond to the nucleotides and inserted space \"-\" for alignment. A mean vector \u2192 m was estimated as \u2192 = \u2211 = n X m / i n i j 1 , , where j = 1, 2,,,, 5 l. The boolean vector was then catered to estimate differences to the mean vector,",

Scaled values of the Principal Components (sPC) were found by placing back the singular values \u03a3 to the unitary matrixes L or R; those for the samples were estimated as \u03a3 = l L sPC / s and the nucleotide bases were estimated as \u03a3 = n R sPC / n . They were scaled for comparisons that enables to identify which base contributed for the differences of samples 22 . Therefore, each sPC presents directions and distances of the differences, which were recorded by the unitary matrix and the singular value, respectively, as sets of orthogonal vectors executed as the columns of the sPC matrixes. Scripts of the R used for the calculation is presented in Fig. S2 . PC signs were derived in a random manner; thus, the results were adjusted to align different presentations for comparison.
