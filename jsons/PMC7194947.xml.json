Furthermore, many patients referred to an oculofacial specialist have recently been fully examined by a comprehensive ophthalmologist, rendering the intraocular portion of the examination superfluous. While there is no perfect substitute for an in-person examination, more than any other ophthalmic subspecialty, oculoplastics is ideally suited for telemedicine.",

Patients with ptosis, dermatochalasis, ectropion entropion, eyelid retraction, congenital deformities, epiphora, and other conditions that rarely threaten vision can be readily identified with telemedicine. Such pre-screening has markedly reduced the number of patients who have needed to be seen urgently without unnecessarily affecting the ultimate prognosis of those whose appointments were rescheduled. Furthermore, the overflow of COVID-19 patients at academic medical centers has restricted the ability of these hospitals to accept transfers that would otherwise have been routine. In response, some patients with orbital disease who would normally be transferred to an academic center for specialized care have been evaluated by telemedicine at a peripheral emergency room, had their radiologic imaging viewed through encrypted videos sent by text, and in conjunction with the local evaluating ophthalmologist, have been effectively managed remotely as an inpatient at the distant site. Patients with non-surgical subperiosteal abscesses and non-infectious orbital inflammatory disease are among those conditions successfully managed under these circumstances.",

In the future, even as clinical volume increases to pre-pandemic levels, it is conceivable that many patients with routine eyelid malpositions, dermatochalasis, eyelid lesions, and similar conditions can be seen in a dedicated telemedicine session, and under certain limiting conditions, could even be scheduled for surgery directly without a prior office visit. Under certain circumstances, some nonsurgical orbital processes, such as the conditions mentioned above, could be managed remotely, while others could be managed with telemedicine after an initial office visit. For example, after an initial evaluation, a portion of the follow up medical management of preseptal cellulitis, orbital inflammatory disease, and Graves orbitopathy could theoretically be conducted remotely.",

In some cases, surgery has been undertaken but modified in response to the pandemic: for example, patients with thyroid-related orbitopathy needing urgent orbital decompression to treat optic nerve compression or severe congestion may undergo a single, very aggressive lateral wall orbital decompression as an initial stabilizing procedure, with the intention of returning later to perform additional decompression after the crisis subsides. Such an approach avoids surgically entering a sinus cavity.",
