Although initially the process may seem daunting, the prolonged period of time for the audit is designed to account for the busy schedule of the ICP and the need to incorporate the audit as part of their routine for the next several months. It is similar to planning a calendar of educational sessions, but instead, unit or ward visits are scheduled into the ICP's day. In this staged manner, the audit becomes less intimidating, particularly because the ICPs can incorporate some of the observational tasks as part of their daily rounds.

The most commonly found deficiencies in the areas reviewed include incorrect storage of clean and dirty supplies, poor compliance with handwashing, incorrect use of barriers, inadequate cleaning of shared equipment, and consumption of food and beverages in the work area. Ways in which deficiencies are addressed include review of work practice with staff, reorganization of service areas to improve infection control compliance, and revision of protocols or procedures. For example, confusion over cleaning of electronic equipment such as oximeters and glucometers led to changes in cleaning protocols and assignment of housekeeping personnel to the task. Identification of poor aseptic technique when accessing multidose lidocaine vials on certain wards led to the immediate withdrawal of this item from unit stock. Documentation of inappropriate mask use and review of exposure risk to airborne disease in our institution led to increased promotion of respirators for high-risk respiratory care and training in their use (prior to severe acute respiratory syndrome). The latter intervention was felt to be a high priority because the region accounted for 38% of all newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases in the province and our institution admitted an average of 64 cases of active respiratory tuberculosis a year.8 These examples of early successes were a direct outcome of the audit process and may have contributed to the facility's successful infection control management of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.9 All of these specific examples were documented as completed on 3- or 6-month follow-up to \u201cclose the loop\u201d between observation, recommendation, and implementation.",

This component of the audit allows for the opportunity to compare the practice of other units within the same institution and is excellent material for postaudit education sessions. It is difficult to determine whether the hand hygiene audits and feedback have improved health care worker compliance, partly because of the numerous barriers and facilitators that affect intent to comply with this simple yet effective measure and partly because the intent of the audits was for feedback rather than as independent evaluation of compliance over time.",

Comprehension of infection control principles is vital to the protection of both staff and patients. The purpose of the knowledge and practice survey as part of the audit process is to ascertain the level of infection control knowledge, to determine whether perception of knowledge is genuine, and to evaluate whether knowledge is applied in the workplace setting. The questionnaire has been particularly useful in detecting areas that require further attention. Infection control arranges education sessions to review the correct responses with unit personnel and circulates FAQ sheets for each question following collection of all the survey forms.",

This is a limitation of the form from an analytical standpoint; however, it must be emphasized that this particular audit tool serves mainly to inform the infection control team of gaps in knowledge and deficiencies in practice, which then can be communicated back to the ward or unit. Future plans for the knowledge assessment form include a factor analysis to verify construct validity and revision to allow for further assessment of changes in knowledge over time. This then would allow for more focused intervention with detailed observations and research questions.",
