Finally, patients should be asked for any exposure to anyone with known or suspected COVID-19 disease in the past 14 days. This screening process is outlined in Figure 1 .

For this reason, we recommend that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who require intubation undergo elective endotracheal intubation in a negative airflow room by an experienced airway specialist using local institutional precautions and backed by CDC Guidelines for infection control 12 before arrival to the IR suite. Unless the need for a secure airway is emergent, intubation should occur after a patient receives acute stroke imaging and is deemed to be a candidate for EVT to avoid unnecessary use of resources. While preprocedural intubation will delay door-to-groin time compared with conscious sedation, retrospective studies are conflicting as to whether this translates into worse functional outcomes. 14, 15 As the AHA recommends, \"it is reasonable to select an anesthetic technique during EVT for AIS on the basis of individualized assessment of patient risk factors, technical performance of the procedure, and other clinical characteristics.\" 16 To mitigate potential worsening of stroke symptoms due to hypotension, we recommend using an intubation strategy that preserves cerebral perfusion pressure using either etomidate or ketamine, 17 with near continuous monitoring of blood pressure. If hypotension does occur, we recommend early use of sympathomimetics and a fluid-conservative resuscitation strategy in accordance with Critical Care Medicine COVID-19 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines. 18 Preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation during intubation, avoidance of bag mask ventilation, rapid sequence intubation facilitated by neuromuscular blockade, and use of video laryngoscopy are also recommended to further limit exposure to secretions and optimize first pass success rate.",

Upon arrival to the IR suite, the endotracheal tube should be clamped with forceps on expiration before being placed on a ventilator or anesthesia machine that has appropriate exhaust port viral filters. If inline ET tube suctioning is to be performed, we again recommend a viral filter on the suctioning exhaust. Consumable ventilator and bag valve mask equipment ought to be preserved for use again postprocedure in management of that patient.

Sterile operators should continue to follow sterile technique with handwashing, surgical mask and cap, eye protection, and sterile gown/gloves. Following the procedure, all staff should remove their PPE in the presence of a trained observer to limit accidental contamination. 20 For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not require intubation before the procedure, we recommend using the contact and droplet precautions outlined above, with the addition of placing a surgical mask over the patient to be worn at all times. PPE for staff, including N95 masks or other respirators for airborne precautions should be immediately available in the IR suite. If supplies are limited, however, they should only be used if a patient unexpectedly develops a need for aerosolizing procedures during EVT (high flow nasal cannula, nebulizer treatment, suctioning, or intubation).

Specifically, we recommend that patients who are admitted to the standard floor (medical/surgical) level of care with confirmed or suspected infection undergo a baseline neurological assessment in addition to their routine nursing and vital sign assessments. Treating physicians should be aware of the increased risk of neurological complications and monitor for these changes. To minimize the duration of nurse/patient encounters, we suggest the rapidly administered Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale which consists of asking a patient to (1) smile, assessing for facial drop; (2) hold both arms up for 10 seconds, assessing for weakness; and (3) repeat a simple phrase, assessing for language dysfunction. The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale has 81% sensitivity for stroke detection. 21 A positive screen should trigger activation of a provider experienced in evaluating stroke patients and, if AIS is strongly suspected, a stat CT head and CT angiogram of the head and neck should be obtained concurrently. Given the risk to staff of transporting a COVID+ patient to the CT scanner, in-person or telemedicine screening by an experienced provider before imaging may be a net benefit despite any delay in care it may impose. Patients should wear a surgical mask at all times and staff in the IR suite should use PPE as described above to avoid exposure. After CT and CT angiogram are performed, IV thrombolytic therapy can be started as appropriate and EVT algorithm can be initiated as above for patients with large vessel occlusions. If a patient is deemed a candidate for EVT, we again recommend careful risk-assessment with respect to airway management by a member of the stroke/neurointerventional team and an experienced airway specialist, as outlined above and in Figure 2 .",

Due to limitations imposed by positive pressure in most IR suites and by the limited supply of PPE, individuals with confirmed, suspected, or unknown status of COVID-19 who require general anesthesia for the procedure should undergo elective endotracheal intubation after confirmation of large vessel occlusion but before arrival in the IR suite to minimize risk of viral spread. Patients who do not require general anesthesia should proceed to the IR suite with a surgical mask in place and with standard contact/droplet precautions, but with N95 masks immediately available should the need for aerosolizing procedures arise. Due to high rates of cardiovascular complications with potentially higher than expected stroke risk, patients admitted with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be monitored for neurological changes and q8h sedation weans should be performed for mechanically ventilated patients when possible. Patients with suspected stroke should be evaluated by experienced providers before imaging, to minimize infectious risk during transportation. It is reasonable to withhold EVT from most patients with COVID-19 undergoing advanced ventilator management for acute respiratory distress syndrome or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to high mortality. To preserve hospital resources during this crisis, patient populations most likely to benefit from thrombectomy, as outlined in AHA/ASA guidelines, should be prioritized for EVT.
