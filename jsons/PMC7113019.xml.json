Despite beliefs that camels are the most likely reservoir of the virus, the limited camel-to-human transmission has been reported by CDC and WHO [4, 5]. Many published findings suggest that camel calves play a potential role in MERS-CoV transmission [6\u20138]. They found the \u2018rate of virus isolation [was] significantly higher in calves\u2019, and calves are often more acutely infected with MERS-CoV than adult camels, suggesting increased infectivity among calves [6\u20138]. Although camel breeding season has been a proposed contributor to MERS-CoV transmission among camels, there is insufficient literature to support that human infections are more common during this time of year.",

While it is known that the virus can be transmitted through respiratory secretions, the exact routes through which the virus spreads are not well understood [9].

The cluster bands seen above the epidemiological curve in Figure 1 illustrate the duration of transmission within each cluster and the corresponding overlap of identified clusters with peak MERS-CoV incidence over the epidemic period of this study. Most temporal peaks correspond with at least two ongoing clusters (see Fig. 1). The time periods of greatest incidence (>35 incident cases at the period's peak) in 2014 and 2015 correspond with at least four ongoing MERS-CoV clusters, of which at least two were classified nosocomial in each of these periods.

Clusters also corresponded with each period of increased MERS-CoV incidence and accounted for over 45% of the total confirmed cases reported, supporting the notion that human-to-human transmission is a prominent driver of the MERS-CoV epidemic. The alignment of nosocomial clusters with the time periods of greatest incidence (>35 incident cases at the period's peak) suggests nosocomial transmission is a key driver of transmission in the MERS-CoV epidemic as opposed to seasonal events, such as the Hajj or camel-breeding season that occur in the fall and spring, respectively. The absence of apparent seasonality in the identified clusters further supports the significant role human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings plays in the propagation of MERS-CoV.",

Additionally, four superspreaders, defined as a confirmed MERS-CoV case responsible for infecting 10 or more secondary cases, played a critical role in the perpetuation of transmission in ROK. The MERS-CoV outbreak in ROK included 15 clusters at separate healthcare institutions, each with an index case related to an ongoing MERS-CoV cluster at another facility. Between May 2015 and July 2015, 186 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported. The geographic distribution and rapid pace at which MERS-CoV spread in ROK demonstrates the susceptibility of healthcare environments to human-to-human transmission of the virus and their catalytic role in MERS-CoV transmission.",

The most common theme in the perpetuation of transmission among nosocomial clusters was the role of more transient departments in the healthcare setting, such as dialysis units and emergency departments, which were implicated in a majority of the nosocomial clusters identified in this analysis. At least seven of the 23 clusters identified in KSA occurred in designated MERS-CoV treatment centers, which were presumably best equipped to handle these infectious cases. However, the nosocomial transmission that persisted in these clusters suggests inconsistent infection control practices across different departments of those designated hospitals [14]. HCWs likely contributed to the continued transmission among patients and between wards within a hospital, as HCWs represent 159 (19\u00b75%) of the cluster-associated cases. Of the 41 clusters classified as nosocomial, 30 clusters (73\u00b72%) involved HCWs.",

If a case was reported from the city during the estimated time in which there was ongoing nosocomial transmission, had no travel or camel exposure in the 14 days prior to illness onset, and had no known household contact with a confirmed MERS-CoV case, the case was included in the case count for that particular nosocomial cluster. Although the particular epidemiological details regarding the exact location of exposure were generally not provided for cases during the three aforementioned clusters, Tier 1 sources often denoted if a case was under investigation for a possible link to a hospital with the known ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV, which reinforced the inclusion of these cases in their respective clusters.",

On average, AFHSB observed an 8\u20139-day lag from the date of symptom onset to the date a case was reported. Considering our analysis aggregated these cases by estimated epidemiological week of illness onset, the impact of this possible artifact is likely to be relatively insignificant to the overall trends observed in this analysis.

A study performed by CDC analyzing case data between September 2012 and January 2016 found that there was likely an under-representation of asymptomatic cases reported from the countries of the Arabian Peninsula. Estimations suggest that the total number of MERS-CoV cases from the region may be 2\u00b73 times greater than the total number of cases recorded to date [17].
