The second most frequent cause is cytomegalovirus (CMV), which produces either diffuse oesophagitis or discrete ulceration. The aetiology of these lesions can be confirmed by biopsy of the centre of ulcerated areas. Detection of CMV inclusion bodies is enhanced by immunoperoxidase staining. Oesophagoscopy occasionally reveals vesicles typical of herpes simplex oesophagitis, diagnosed either by biopsy or smears from brushings showing typical giant cells. As many as 10% of oesophageal ulcers leading to dysphagia are idiopathic, possible causes being unknown opportunistic viruses or HIV itself.1 These ulcers may respond to thalidomide.",

            "text": "HIV was initially believed to cause intestinal symptoms since HIV-seropositive individuals free from intestinal pathogens commonly have diarrhoea. However, the frequency of \u201cpathogen-negative diarrhoea\u201d depends on the extent of the diagnostic investigations and the definition of diarrhoea. In a prospective study2 of pathogen-negative diarrhoea, follow-up revealed an unsuspected pathogen in only a minority. Most patients had low-volume diarrhoea that either resolved spontaneously or was controlled with antimotility agents, a response that accords with the features of irritable bowel syndrome. HIV-seropositive persons free from intestinal pathogens do have minor abnormalities of villus architecture, characteristically a mild villus atrophy associated with either crypt hypoplasia or hyperplasia.3 These minor abnormalities are unlikely to cause diarrhoea since they occur in symptom-free individuals and are associated either with no or with very mild malabsorption of carbohydrates.4 However, there is a consistent increase in small-bowel permeability in HIV-seropositive individuals;5 this functional abnormality and the minor structural abnormalities of the small bowel mucosa may be due to the immunological changes produced by HIV infection of lamina propria lymphocytes. Activated T cells cause villus atrophy in fetal gut explants,5 and HIV causes activation of these cells. HIV can be identified in the lamina propria of both the large and small intestine but its detection or quantification is not related to diarrhoea.6 Whether HIV also infects small-bowel mucosal cells, as was initially shown by in-situ hybridisation, is unknown.7 Other possible mechanisms for villus damage include ingress of foreign antigens because of the increased permeability that sets in motion a vicious circle of release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Alternatively, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine of HIV-seropositive patients, as reported in some small studies, might produce an inflammatory response and villus atrophy.8 Bacterial overgrowth might occur because of the hypochlorhydria reported in AIDS patients.9 Hypochlorhydria is common in those with starvation and systemic infection10 and may therefore occur in advanced AIDS without any HIV-induced defects in gastric secretion. Neither hypochlorhydria nor bacterial overgrowth is a universal finding in patients with advanced HIV infection, so these mechanisms are unlikely to have an important role in villus atrophy.",

Infections are commonly found in the large intestine, and sigmoidoscopy with rectal biopsies is probably the best initial invasive gastroenterological investigation in patients with diarrhoea. 10-30% of cases of CMV colitis affect only the right side of the colon or small intestine, so colonoscopy or small-intestinal biopsy may be indicated in individuals with persistent diarrhoea and negative rectal biopsy.33\nCryptosporidia may not always take up appropriate stains in the stool and some infections are diagnosed only by histological examination of small or large bowel biopsy specimens.

The somatostatin analogues octreotide and vapreotide are used in HIV-seropositive individuals with diarrhoea because of a motility effect and possibly because HIV has aminoacid sequences similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and may induce diarrhoea by upregulating VIP receptors.34 Increased concentrations of VIP have been shown in some patients with pathogen-negative diarrhoea, in whom octreotide has likewise been successful.35 Somatostatin analogues are most effective for pathogen-negative diarrhoea and less so in protozoal diarrhoea, with one placebo-controlled study showing no effect.36 These expensive agents are unlikely to have a wide role in the treatment of HIV-related diarrhoea.",

In at least a third of patients, diarrhoea resolves spontaneously, especially in those with an initial CD4 count above 200/\u03bcL. Investigation of suitable therapeutic agents is hampered by inability to culture the organism in vitro and the major differences between animal models and human infection. Although many agents have been used, the only one with proven efficacy is paromomycin, which reduces stool volumes by about 50%.40 Quantitative stool analyses have shown some reduction in oocyst excretion with therapy but the organism is seldom eradicated.41 Because therapy of this infection is so difficult, primary prophylaxis would be a highly desirable goal. Human cryptosporidiosis is a waterborne infection. Since the minimum infectious dose is low\u2014between one and five oocysts in gnotobiotic animals42 and 20-50 oocysts in healthy human beings43\u2014standard screening tests of metropolitan water supplies may not be sensitive enough for detection.

Both initial treatment and the decision to give maintenance therapy will therefore depend on the initial severity of symptoms. Since diagnosis of cytomegalovirus enteritis is improving, patients with milder symptoms are being detected and the quality of life with treatment\u2014anti-CMV agents have to be given intravenously and have considerable toxicity\u2014 may not be enhanced compared with no therapy. Whether such patients left untreated will develop complications of CMV enteritis such as toxic dilation and perforation, which were common in the early years of the epidemic, remains to be determined. Oral ganciclovir in a high dose to overcome problems of bioavailability may have a limited role as primary prophylaxis in preventing the development of CMV disease. Nevertheless, such therapy has major toxicity, only limited benefit, and is extremely expensive. Widespread use of primary prophylaxis must await the development of more effective agents or of other markers that allow better prediction of patients who are most likely to develop CMV disease.",

Certain opportunistic infections, especially M avium intracellulare and CMV, produce a cachectic response in which the REE is further raised and there is a more pronounced loss of lean body mass, likely to be related to inappropriate cytokine release.48\n",
