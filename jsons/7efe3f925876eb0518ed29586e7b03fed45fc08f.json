Several factors especially the impaired immune response, heightened inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state contribute to the increased disease severity. However, there are many contentious issues about which the evidence is rather limited. There are some theoretical concerns about the effects of different anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. Similarly, despite the recognition of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), and the role of ACE2 in lung injury; there are conflicting results with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in these patients. Management of patients with diabetes in times of restrictions on mobility poses some challenges and novel approaches like telemedicine can be useful. There is a need to further study the natural course of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes and to understand the individual, regional and ethnic variations in disease prevalence and course.",

            "text": "How diabetes increases severity of COVID-19 is unclear, though several factors may be responsible (Table 1) . Poor glycaemic control impairs several aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections and to the potential secondary bacterial infection in the lungs [6, 7] . Defects in immunity namely inappropriate T-cell action, impaired natural killer cell activity and defects in complement action could reduce viral clearance [8] . Interestingly, ARDS in patients with COVID-19 is driven by severe hypoxaemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the cytokine storm, which is believed to be responsible for ARDS as well as multi-organ dysfunction in COVID-19 [9] . In this context, it is important to note that there is strong association between type 2 diabetes, obesity and abnormal secretion of adipokines and cytokines like TNF-alfa and interferon, which may further impair immunity and predispose to severe infection [10] . Further, diabetes is associated with increased plasminogen levels which has been postulated to increase the virulence of SARS CoV-2 [11] . Presence of these inflammation and prothrombotic factors has been shown in a study in 174 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China; significantly higher serum levels of interleukein 6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen and D-dimer were reported in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes [12] . Increased viral replication in diabetes may also due to an increase in furin, which is a type-1 membranebound protease involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell [13] . In addition, pre-existing comorbidities associated with diabetes like hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease further worsen the prognosis. Lastly, hypoglycaemia which could occur during treatment of diabetes may additionally worsen the clinical outcomes.",

One study in the USA did not find any significant difference in mortality in patients who received ACE inhibitors and ARBs and those who did not [31] . In this subject situation is far from clear and there are too many unknown factors, which might be operative in the interaction between ACE2, diabetes, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and lung injury. The lack of evidence for either benefit or harm has prompted European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension, European Society of Hypertension and American Heart Association to advise continuing with ACE inhibitors and ARBs in case a patient develops COVID-19 [35] .

The natural course of the disease after infection of patients with diabetes with SARS CoV-2 has not been documented well. For example, we don't know if the incubation period is different in people with diabetes. It is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young, have short duration of diabetes, and well controlled may have less severe COVID-19 infection. There is a possibility of reduced viral clearance in diabetes as has been reported in patients who are on corticosteroids [37] . This could have public health implications as the patients with diabetes could remain infectious for a longer period than those without diabetes. a. Chloroquine has also been licensed for use in India for patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the efficacy of chloroquine is not proven; it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [38] . Chloroquine has a weak anti-hyperglycaemic effect and there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other antihyperglycaemic drugs. b.

High-risk groups like those with high HbA1c, those with comorbidities, long duration of diabetes or elderly could be chosen for testing, however, utility of this approach remains to be proven, There are frequent false negative tests and repeated testing may be required in asymptomatic individuals. Since there is no treatment currently recommended for asymptomatic people, therefore apart from isolating them, detecting these patients might not prove meaningful clinically. (7) Ethnic variations in severity of COVI19 in patients with diabetes? In the United States, the disease has caused disproportionately more fatalities in Blacks and Asians compared with Whites [44] . South Asia, Africa and Korea have seen much lower mortality than rest of the world. Whether it is because of the different approaches topublic health measures, innate immunity or due to some ethnicity-specific variability in response to viral infection, or availability of good medical resources, remains to be studied. Interactions between ethnicity, diabetes and severity of COVID-19 will be of interest, considering the racial disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. According to a recent report, prevalence of COVID-19 and mortality due to the disease correlated significantly with frequency of D allele in ACE gene [45] . Such polymorphisms in ACE gene as well as several other genes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 might be responsible for individual and ethnic variations in disease course.
