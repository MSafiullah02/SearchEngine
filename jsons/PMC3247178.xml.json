They are also crucial for the inflammation pathways, as they are the first step for the production of eicosanoids and other inflammatory mediators [1,2]. Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is the low molecular, well conserved and secreted form of the enzyme. It is excreted into the alveoli mainly by macrophages and mast cells [1-3]. sPLA2 has a dual role, as it contributes to the inflammation pathway and it is also the main enzyme involved in the catabolism of surfactant [1,2,4] This complex proteo-lipid mixture is essential for the alveolar opening and the maintenance of an adequate gas exchange.",

            "text": "A wide body of literature suggests a role for sPLA2 in the development of ARDS and acute lung injury (ALI), its milder form. sPLA2 interferes with the surfactant activity and so reduces compliance [4-6]. sPLA2 starts a vicious cycle in which it damages the surfactant; since some surfactant components have their own inhibitory effect on sPLA2 activity and expression [7,8], the sPLA2-induced surfactant damage reduces this inhibition and thus the enzyme is able to further catabolize the surfactant phospholipids [4]. Thus, sPLA2 facilitates the action of other injurious agents against the lung epithelium, leading to further surfactant damage, alveolar collapse and respiratory impairment [4]. This process is also linked to the lung tissue inflammation, since TNF\u03b1 and some other pro-inflammatory cytokines are strong sPLA2 inductors throughout the regulation of NFkB nuclear transcription factor [4,7,8]. Moreover, sPLA2 itself starts the inflammatory cascade, since it is the first step in the biochemical pathway leading to the production of arachidonic acid derivatives [9]. Inflammation may further inactivate surfactant, contributing to the above-described vicious cycle [4-6]. sPLA2 activity is raised in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in animal models of ARDS and in adult patients and this correlates with the clinical severity and mortality [4,5,8,10]. We recently found raised enzyme levels in post-neonatal ARDS, similarly to the adult findings [11]. Moreover, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection seems to cause a more severe ARDS because of the sPLA2 over-expression, triggered by the RSV itself [12]. Consistently, transgenic animals defective for the CCSP gene, experience higher inflammation and mucous production, when infected by RSV [13].",

An inadequate surfactant production is the pivotal cause of hyaline membrane disease, also called infant respiratory distress syndrome (iRDS), the most frequent respiratory disease of preterm infants [16]. Although exogenous surfactant administration is curative in many preterm infants, long-term respiratory sequels are still a significant problem in this population, with 20% of the surviving preterm babies affected by BPD [17]. Moreover, the tiniest babies born at the limit of viability often require multiple surfactant administrations. Many of these very preterm deliveries are associated with infections and chorioamnionitis [18]. In these cases, inflammation lengthens the lung injury, decreasing the usefulness of exogenous surfactant and damaging the lung tissue [18]. In such situation, sPLA2 is likely to play a crucial role: we found increased sPLA2 levels in babies with iRDS comparing to normal term neonates [19]. sPLA2 was found to increase foetal neutrophil migration and so to enhance lung tissue inflammation [20]. Babies with higher sPLA2 activity are likely to be the ones needing repeated surfactant administrations and they are at higher risk for chronic lung disease.",

Moreover, not only the pancreatic sPLA2 but also the pulmonary isoforms of the enzyme may be involved in the syndrome, [34] as lung sPLA2 production may be boosted by the meconium-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [35-37] and through a specific cross-talk between different enzyme isoforms [38]. Consistently, we have recently found raised levels of pulmonary sPLA2 in BALF of patients affected by MAS when compared to their own meconium and to control babies [39].

Inflammation is a complex process and is essential in many of these conditions: sPLA2 might be the main crossroad between inflammation and surfactant catabolism. Since this latter is surely an important component of some clinical situations, sPLA2 is worth to be studied in its metabolic and genetic issues, trying to correlate them to the clinical pictures.",
