The vaccine is given in three doses, one each at the ages of 2, 3, and 5 months. A prospective study carried out in 2009-2011 found that hospital admissions for rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) in Finland were reduced by 80% in the first season after the introduction of RV5, and no change was seen in the second season [8] . This type of pattern was also reported in the United States, in which a high impact of rotavirus vaccination was seen in the first season after vaccine introduction followed by a rise in rotavirus activity in the second season, low activity in the third season, and so on [9, 10] . Indirect effects of rotavirus vaccination were also reported among unvaccinated children and adults in the United States, Austria, and Belgium [9, 11, 12] . In contrast, the introduction of RV5 has given rise to some vaccine-derived rotavirus (vdRV) strains. One clinically significant strain is a double-reassortant vdG1P [8] , which originates from vaccine strains G1P7 [5] and G6P1 [8] [13, 14] . The vdG1P [8] strain can cause disease and infect unvaccinated children and can spread in the environment [15] .",

Nucleotide sequences read from chromatograms were aligned to published sequences from GenBank (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank).

The other detected vdRV G-types were G3 (n = 1), G4 (n = 1), and G6 (n = 2). In five cases, the vaccine G-type G1 was associated with P [8] and formed a potential double-reassortant G1P [8] between vaccine strains G1P [5] and G6P [8] . Two others had bovine G-type G6. In the other 6 cases, the P-type was of bovine origin P [5] , the P-type was detected alone or concomitantly with P [8] , or no VP4 could be detected (Table 2) . Apart from 1 case who tested positive for vaccine type G1 but negative for VP4, all rotavirus cases with a vaccine strain tested positive for bovine VP6 by RT-PCR. Of the 15 children with vdRV, we had enough material available from 10 cases to perform all tests for the presence of other gastroenteritis viruses and found coinfection with norovirus, sapovirus, or coronavirus in 7, 2, and 1 case, respectively. The vaccine-associated cases have already been reported [16, 18] .",

In the fourth season, the dominant genotype was G3P [8] , followed by G1P [8] . In Finland, wtRV genotype G3P [8] was less common in the prevaccination years; however, this finding has to be considered with caution, because the numbers in the post-NIP years are much smaller than those in the prevaccination years. In addition, an emergent worldwide wtRV genotype (G12P [8] ) was observed in the fourth post-NIP season. The emergence of novel genotypes such as G8 and G12 was also noticed elsewhere [24] . Changes in the dominant wtRV genotypes after the introduction of rotavirus vaccination have been seen worldwide, but because similar changes occurred before licensure of the rotavirus vaccines, any causal link to universal rotavirus vaccination is uncertain [25] [26] [27] [28] .",
