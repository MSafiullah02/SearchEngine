Skin wounds are usually associated with absent or poor bleeding and are difficult to manage. The main histological changes include a thin epidermis and a severely atrophic dermis with disorganized collagen fibres that are reduced in number and size. 2 Hair follicle atrophy can be variable whereas arrector pili muscles appear relatively enlarged. Masson's trichrome stain can demonstrate tinctorial abnormalities of collagen fibres whereas elastic fibres are normal. 2, 3 Electron microscopy reveals collagen bundles that are convoluted and arranged haphazardly with fibrils of different diameters, and loosely packed. 4 This syndrome is described in cats suffering from diseases with well-known negative effects on collagen synthesis including hypercortisolism (spontaneous or iatrogenic) or excessive use of progestational drugs. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] It also has been reported in association with different diseases where the pathogenesis is not clear including hepatic lipidosis, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), cholangiohepatitis, cholangiocarcinoma and multicentric lymphoma. 4, [10] [11] [12] [13] To the best of the authors' knowledge, histopathological descriptions postrecovery are not available due to the fact that cats usually don't recover or are euthanized shortly after diagnosis. There is one case of a reversible defect in a cat experimentally receiving phenytoin. 14 This case report describes three cases of FSFS associated with cachexia secondary to different causes without the implication of steroidal hormones.",

Dermatological examination revealed a dull sparse hair coat and easily visible blood vessels in the region of clipping. One single, nonbleeding, irregular skin tear of about 3 cm was observed on the sacral region ( Figure 1 ). Radiographs revealed the presence of mega oesophagus and an alveolar pattern in the cranial lung lobes consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Oral antibiotic therapy was started once daily with cefadroxil (Cefacure Tabs, MSD Animal Health; Milan, Italy; 25 mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer; Milan, Italy; 5 mg/kg). Specific management of feeding to reduce the risk of regurgitation was introduced. Histopathological findings were consistent with FSFS. The owner declined any further investigation to determine the cause of mega oesophagus. Three months later, the cat was 3.2 kg and the respiratory and cutaneous problems were resolved. A second biopsy of macroscopically normal skin was taken 11 months after the first visit. There has been no recurrence three years after the condition was diagnosed.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] It is presumed that reduced collagen synthesis due to endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids contributes to the aetiopathogenesis of this syndrome. Less commonly, FSFS has been described in cats affected by severe inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic diseases without glucocorticoids involvement. [10] [11] [12] [13] In these latter cases none of the cats recovered, contrary to this report. Hepatic lipidosis, a condition frequently observed in FSFS, was excluded in cases 1 and 2 by abdominal ultrasound and in Case 3 because the history was not consistent with this disease. In the cats in this series, skin fragility was diagnosed after the development of a cachectic condition. A common element observed in cases 1 and 2 was the relatively abrupt reduction in food intake and the consequent rapid and marked weight loss. Undoubtedly, the presence of infectious diseases likely contributed to the development of cachexia. In Case 2, FIV was considered to have a chronic course but it could have further hampered the recovery of the cat exacerbating its already limited ability to feed itself. In the kitten (Case 3), malnutrition was the only suspected cause. In this cat, the high-energy requirements due to the young age may have prompted the development of cachexia, even in the absence of a concurrent illness.",

            "text": "These case reports seem to reinforce the hypothesis that lack of nutrient intake and severe catabolic state, as happens during cachexia, can negatively influence collagen production in some predisposed cats, leading to skin fragility. As demonstrated by histological examination and special stains, the skin of these cats was indistinguishable from the controls once the animals recovered from the cachectic status. Because corticosteroids also induce a b c d a catabolic state, the steroid-induced FSFS and the cachexia-related FSFS could share, at least partially, similar pathogenic pathways. Cachexia per se, or in association with other specific diseases, could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of FSFS, mainly in those cases where exogenous steroids are not involved. This report demonstrates that not all the cats with FSFS have a poor prognosis and, depending on the cause, a complete recovery is possible.",

FSFS wird im Zusammenhang mit Erkrankungen gesehen, bei denen eine hohe Steroidproduktion vorkommt, die die Kollagensynthese inhibieren kann. Es wird ebenfalls gleichzeitig mit hochgradig entz\u20ac undlichen, infekti\u20ac osen oder neoplastischen Zust\u20ac anden, bei denen die Pathogenese weitgehend unbekannt ist, beschrieben. e um dist urbio adquirido caracterizado pela produc \u00df\u00e3o alterada de col ageno, resultando em uma pele extremamente fr agil e atrofiada.

No Caso 3, a causa prim aria suspeita para SFCF foi a malnutric \u00df\u00e3o.

Eine Beschreibung der histopathologischen Merkmale von Bindegewebe sowohl in fragiler wie auch in abgeheilter Haut. Ergebnisse -Alle Katzen entwickelten in weniger als zwei Wochen eine Kachexie (Body Condition Score reichte von 1-1,5). Bei Fall 1 wurden Begleiterkrankungen diagnostiziert (Aspirationspneumonie aufgrund eines Mega\u20ac osophagus) und bei Fall 2 (Felines Immundefizienzvirus (FIV). Bei Fall 3 wurde eine Feh-lern\u20ac ahrung als Prim\u20ac arursache vermutet. Die haupts\u20ac achlichen histologischen Merkmale der fragilen Haut waren eine atrophische Dermis mit schwach-eosinophilen, d\u20ac unnen und unregelm\u20ac a\u00dfigen Kollagenfasern mit zahlreichen roten Stammfasern, die mittels Massonf\u20ac arbung gesehen wurden. Die elastischen Fasern waren normal. Die histopathologischen Befunde nach der Erholungsphase wiesen 11 (Fall 1) und sechs Monate (Fall 3) nach der Diagnose auf eine Normalisierung des Kollagens und der ganzen Haut im Vergleich mit den Kontrollen hin. Schlussfolgerungen und klinische Bedeutung -Nach bestem Wissen der Autoren handelt es sich hierbei um den ersten Bericht einer reversiblen, nicht durch Steroide induzierten FSFS, die im Zusammenhang mit einer sich rasch entwickelnden Kachexie bei Katzen auftrat.",
