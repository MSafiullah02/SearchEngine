Such aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) can lead to close proximity transmission of aerosols, but also in the spread of small aerosols over extensive distances resulting in airborne transmission. According to colleagues in other countries such as China, Italy, and Iran, Otolaryngologists are among the highest risk group of contracting viruses while performing upper airway procedures without appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [10]. As there is worldwide limited availability of PPE, it is essential to distinguish which procedures justify the use of high level, airborne precautions. The objective of this literature review is to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) and provide evidence-based recommendations.",

A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review Databases from inception to April 3, 2020. Given aerosol and droplet terminology has been used interchangeably in the literature, the search included both terms. A screening literature search was first performed using the search term (aerosol* or droplet*) and (procedure or treatment or surgery). The authors, J.H., A.H., C.L., J. P, YWQ, and P.Y. reviewed the articles for topics that pertained to the realm of the head and neck region. All abstracts were reviewed and the following inclusion criteria was applied: English articles, clinical or experimental studies involving procedures in the head and neck region. Studies were excluded if they were opinion papers, review papers, or if only the abstract was published (no manuscript available). This first review of papers led to the following procedures being identified: nasal endoscopy, nasal packing and treatment of epistaxis, endoscopic sinonasal and anterior skull base surgery, CO2 laser ablation, electrocautery, tracheotomy, endotracheal suctioning, oropharyngeal surgery, head and neck reconstruction surgery, dental procedures, mastoid surgery and nebulizer/atomizer. A second focused literature search was performed for each of the aforementioned procedures using the search term (aerosol* or droplet*) and the synonyms of the procedure (e.g. (aerosol or droplet) and (mastoidectomy or mastoid* or mastoid surgery)). The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied except this time procedures that were in the head and neck region but not performed by an Otolaryngologist were removed (example: irrigation wash in dental procedure). This was done in order to ensure no further articles were missed on the first search and to keep articles chosen were relevant to the audience of interest. Review papers were also cross referenced to ensure all studies were identified.",

In this review an AGMP is defined as a medical procedure which has the potential to generate small (< 5-10um) aerosols that can travel greater than 2 m, and therefore an AGMP confers the potential for airborne transmission. In contrast, we defined droplet transmission as involving (larger) aerosols over short distances (< 2 m) directly from the infected person to the susceptible person via mechanisms such as coughing and sneezing. Each AGMP procedure category was assigned to a practicing Otolaryngologist Head & Neck Surgeon to review the evidence found in the articles, grade the evidence of the articles and develop recommendations for practice. The recommendations were created based on study design, the quality of research, directness of evidence and finally the balance between the potential harm of the procedure and the quality of evidence [12]. Since the potential harm of aerosolizing viable pathogens can have a large impact on the safety of HCWs, a strong recommendation can still be warranted despite low or very low confidence in effect estimates [12]. Direct and high quality evidence was defined as studies evaluating directly, or indirectly particles/aerosol concentrations in air samples. Indirect evidence could be obtained from experimental cadaver models, or retrospective epidemiological data. The manuscript then underwent an iterative review process in the following order: M. L, C.D., J.L., D.D.S., L. S and A.T.",

(2020) simulated potential aerosolization events using a cadaver with the nasal mucosa coated with fluorescein over a range of endoscopic procedures [13]. The potential aerosolization risk was quantified using a cadaveric model with fluorescein, a blue-light filter and digital image processing. The paper concludes nasal endoscopy did not generate aerosols; however, simulated coughing and sneezing using an atomization device did [13]. The tip of the atomizer was placed posterior to the internal valve, which may not accurately represent a true cough or sneeze. Nevertheless, activation of the atomizer device resulted in particle contamination up to 66 cm from the nare (produced droplet size: >30um), which by definition is droplet contamination. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified mask with a glove window were successful in eliminating all detectable spread of the particles [13].\n",

The authors hypothesized that the low aerosol spread with the microdebrider is due to the relatively low speed of rotation (in comparison to a drill) and the presence of a large-bore suction in the debrider [13]. The study does not explore the possibility of aerosol formation when the microdebrider suction is plugged but still rotating. The use of a high-speed powered drill did create high airflow velocities and was therefore considered aerosol generating and contamination was identified with both endonasal and external activation of the drill. The aerosol size produced from drilling was not stated. Closing or obstructing the nostrils during this procedure did not cease aerosol generation [13].\n",

Electrocautery generates a high concentration of fine particles with diameters in the range of 10 nm to 1um [26]. There appears to be a direct positive relationship between the electrical current used during cauterization and particle concentration [24]. Higher current levels resulted in a significant increase in particle aerosolization. Ishihama et al.

Nasal endoscopy, epistaxis management and in-office sinonasal procedures can induce sneezing and coughing of the patient. Although sneezing and coughing is considered to result in mainly droplet transmission, HCWs should be aware that the resulting clouds also contain small, inspirable aerosols, which can impose a risk, when they are working in close proximity to the patient [4, 7, 8].",

The highest viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 have been found in the upper and lower airways, but the virus has also been identified in feces [53]. Viral RNA has even been found in the blood of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, and as such, inhaled aerosol of blood may potentially transmit infection [54, 55]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be quite sensitive to temperature, being largely inactivated at temperatures above 70 \u00b0C [56]. This is important given the high temperature of electrocautery may result in nonviable virus in the plume. This matter is of great importance, not just to our specialty, but to all surgeons operating in this era.",

Although coughing and sneezing mainly results in the emission of larger droplets, the risk of inhaling potentially smaller SARS-CoV-2 infected aerosols should not be neglected, especially if the HCW is in close proximity. For in-office endonasal procedures and nasopharyngoscopy, in the vast majority of patients, standard level 2 airborne PPE, including N95 masks are recommended. We further recommend keeping as much distance from the patient by using video endoscopy instead of the eye-piece. On the other hand, aerosolizing procedures in SARS-CoV-2 positive or suspected patients warrant extreme airborne precautions and level 3 PPE is recommended by our working group, which include either powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) or body/face/eye protection with N99/FFP3 respirators (99% filtration rate, or 95% if not available) [57, 58]. In addition, it is recommended that AGMPs are performed in negative pressure rooms to minimize the risk of spread of contaminated aerosols.",

Virus kinetics can differ significantly and this not only includes the potential to survive in aerosols, but also its sensitivity to heat and shear stress during drilling.

As the risks of potential infection with SARS-CoV-2 are significant, a careful balance between the potential harms of the procedure and quality of the available evidence was considered in these recommendations. Therefore, a strong recommendation that a procedure is an AGMP can be provided despite the paucity of high quality and direct evidence. For example, regarding endoscopic use of microdebriders, due to high-speed rotation of the blade, the authors recommend the microdebrider be considered an AGMP as clinical experience intraoperatively conveys frequent microdebrider suction port plugging. To minimize the risk, we suggest the placement of a suction in the nose or suction catheter in the nasopharynx either in the contralateral nostril or via the oropharynx. The use of the suction near the surgical field is also recommended when using electrocautery or the CO2 laser. Furthermore, given the evidence that endotracheal suctioning is an AGMP, there is a similar theoretical risk of fenestrated suction use in the oral, ear and nasal cavity, for which we suggest the use of level 2 PPE precautions.",
