Typical SPLs are irregular polyhedral units which vary in size, measuring from approximately 1-2.5 cm in diameter and incorporating up to 24 acini (Webb 2006 for SPLs ranges from 11 to 17 mm in adults. The SPL is surrounded by a mantle of connective tissue septa.

The region near the origin of the terminal bronchioles is termed the \"centrilobular\" region.

These structures are too small to be directly visualized on thin-section CT, but may be indirectly assessed as they are responsible for the background density of the lung on CT scans. Parenchymal background density reflects the proportions of fluid (blood and extravascular fluid), gas, and tissue. When ILD causes an increase of fluid or cells within the alveoli, or thickening of the alveolar septa through cellular infiltration or fibrosis, then parenchymal background density will change in turn and ground-glass opacities may be identified at CT. Conversely, a decrease in fluid, cells, and tissue (in relation to air), as seen in emphysema, causes a reduction of the parenchymal density, in comparison to the normal state. The thickening of the intralobular interstitium and the interlobular septa by fibrosis or infiltration leads to a reticular pattern.",

This technique uses a \"step-and-shoot\" or \"spaced\" approach, in which thin sections with 0.5-1.5 mm thickness scans are obtained at 10-20 mm intervals. The large gaps between the sections considerably lower the radiation dose applied and allows for increasing the dose for each of the thin sections. Therefore, each of these sections offers a very good image quality with low noise and high spatial resolution. This high quality comes along with the disadvantage of a discontinuous CT data set with 10-20 mm gaps between the sections hampering the ability for exact comparison to prior examinations if the images are not perfectly aligned in z-direction.

In addition to visualize diffuse structural changes of the lung parenchyma it adds the ability to detect and interpret sparsely distributed abnormalities of the lung parenchyma as well as focal disease which might have been missed using the classic spaced HRCT approach due to the gaps between the sections. The resulting volumetric, near isotropic data sets also permit the reconstruction of high quality multiplanar images which enable for better recognition of the distribution of disease, for example, to identify and rate a possible apico-basal gradient in the lung. Finally, continuous data acquisition allows the generation of thick maximum intensity projections (MIP) which are helpful for the detection of micronodular disease and centrilobular abnormalities. There are also some trade-offs with volumetric high-resolution CT scanning. For most scanners, except the most recent generation, the radiation dose is five to ten times higher, and the image quality concerning noise and spatial inplane resolution is lower in comparison to the introduced sequential HRCT. This image quality reduction is most apparent in the depiction of small septa, ground-glass opacities as well in increased image noise (Studler et al. 2005) . Its clinical significance has yet to be determined.",

However, in the last years, for most of the regions of the body, the recent generations of iterative reconstruction kernels have become standard of care and outperformed FBP in terms of image quality. However, due to the requirements in terms of spatial resolution for visualizing the lung accurately, there is still a controversy in radiology, whether iterative reconstruction should be used for the lung and which strength and software algorithm is best suited. Therefore, the iterative reconstruction algorithm should carefully be selected and should be applied only with moderate strength for adequate visualization of the lung parenchyma.",

IPF shares nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as gradual onset of progressive dyspnea and cough, with other IIP. There is a slight male predominance and patients are usually over the age of 50. Typically, patients do not respond to corticosteroid treatment. In 2014 two antifibrotic drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone were approved for treatment of IPF but survival benefit has not been established with either agent (Antoniou et al. 2016) . Therefore currently, the only life-prolonging therapy consists of lung transplantation (Thabut et al. 2003) . While the term IPF characterizes the clinical entity, the term \"usual interstitial pneumonia\" is used to describe the histologic and radiologic patterns associated with IPF. The histologic and radiologic features of UIP are characterized by heterogeneity with areas of normal lung alternating with patchy fibrosis. The typical computed tomographic (CT) findings in UIP are predominantly basal and peripheral reticular opacities with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis ( Fig. 6a ) (Mueller-Mang et al. 2007 ). Groundglass opacities are usually present, but limited in extent. According to the recent guidelines established by American, European, Japanese and Latin American Societies radiologist should use the following terms to indicate the diagnostic confidence of a UIP pattern (Raghu et al. 2011 ): (definite) \"UIP\" pattern, \"possible UIP\" pattern, \"inconsistent with UIP\" pattern. A pattern of \"UIP\" requires the presence of following four CT findings: (1) subpleural, basal predominance, (2) reticular opacities, (3) honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis, and (4) absence of features listed as inconsistent with UIP pattern. A \"possible UIP\" pattern is defined by the same criteria as \"UIP\" pattern but without honeycombing. HRCT findings that are \"inconsistent with UIP\" include (1) an upper or mid-lung predominance, (2) a peribronchovascular predominance, (3) extensive ground-glass opacities, exceeding reticulation in extent, (4) profuse micronodules (bilateral, predominantly upper lobes), (5) discrete cysts, (6) diffuse mosaic attenuation or air trapping, (7) segmental or lobar consolidation and are listed in detail in Table 2 .",

Patients with NSIP are usually between 40 and 50 years old, and men and women are equally affected. Compared to IPF, patients with NSIP have a variable, but overall more favorable, course of disease and the majority of patients stabilize or improve on corticosteroid therapy. According to the predominance of either inflammatory cells or fibrosis, NSIP is histologically subdivided into a cellular and a fibrotic subtype. Cellular NSIP is less common than fibrotic NSIP and carries a substantially better prognosis (Travis et al. 2000) . On HRCT, NSIP is characterized by patchy ground-glass opacities combined with irregular linear or reticular opacities (Johkoh et al. 2002) (Fig. 7a, b) . In fibrotic NSIP traction bronchiectasis become more evident and honeycombing may be present, but is typically limited in severity and extent. It has also been referred to as microcystic honeycombing (Desai et al. 2004) . In contrast to the heterogeneous lung involvement and the typical a b Fig. 6 (a, b) Axial CT image in a 63-year-old man with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) shows bilateral reticular opacities, honeycombing (black arrowheads), and traction bronchiectasis (arrow).

Acute exacerbation in the same patient shows marked progression of ground-glass opacities (arrowheads) (b) apico-basal gradient in UIP, HRCT in NSIP reveals rather symmetric and homogeneous lung involvement without an obvious gradient (Fig. 8) .

Occasionally, a single large nodule may be present in sarcoidosis and resemble bronchogenic carcinoma. Ground-glass opacities are common in sarcoidosis and have been postulated to represent alveolitis in early reports; however, according to pathologic correlation ground-glass opacities in sarcoidosis are more likely to represent microgranulomas with or without perigranulomatous fibrosis (Nishimura et al. 1993) . Patients with predominant groundglass opacities on initial CT scan have a worse prognosis than patients with a predominant nodular pattern (Murdoch and Muller 1992; Akira et al. 2005) . When sarcoidosis progresses to fibrosis, architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis classically radiating from the hilum to the adjacent upper and lower lobes can be found. Other common CT abnormalities in fibrotic sarcoidosis include honeycombing, cysts, and bulla formation. Airway stenosis in sarcoidosis is usually due to extrinsic scarring, or to endobronchial granulomas, whereas lymphadenopathy alone is a rare cause of symptomatic airway narrowing.",

Based on the length and intensity of exposure and subsequent duration of illness, clinical presentations of HP are categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic progressive. In acute HP, patients present 4-12 h following heavy exposure to an inciting agent with fever, chills, and myalgias. In subacute and chronic HP, patients have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. HRCT in acute HP typically shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules, most commonly in a random distribution (Tomiyama et al. 2000) . However, due to the short duration of symptoms patients rarely undergo CT scanning in the acute phase. In the subacute phase, centrilobular nodules become more prominent and patchy groundglass opacities can be found. In some patients cystic lesions (3-25 mm) have been observed (Franquet et al. 2003) . Chronic HP is characterized by the presence of reticulation due to fibrosis superimposed on findings of subacute HP (Fig. 24) . The abnormalities are usually predominantly located in the upper lobes, while the lung bases are relatively spared (Silva et al. 2008 ).

            "text": "Pneumoconiosis is a non-neoplastic reaction to the inhalation and accumulation of dust particles in the lung. The particles are engulfed by alveolar macrophages that release inflammatory cytokines and induce fibrotic changes. The classification of pneumoconiosis is based on chest radiographs using the International Labor Organization (ILO) classification scheme. The HRCT features in patients with silicosis and coal worker pneumoconiosis consist of small, well-circumscribed nodules that are usually 2-5 mm in diameter and predominantly affect the upper and posterior lung zones. The nodules have a perilymphatic distribution, thus affecting the interlobular septa and the peribronchovsacular and subpleural interstitium. The nodules in silicosis tend to be larger and better defined than those in coal worker pneumoconiosis (Kim et al. 2001) . Occasionally, eggshell calcifications in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. The presence of nodules larger than 1 cm is indicative of complicated pneumoconiosis, also known as progressive massive fibrosis. These nodules coalesce and form conglomerate masses that are typically located in the upper lobe of the lung. In large lesions, cavitation may occur, which is due to either ischemic Fig. 24 Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a 52-year-old man related to mold exposure. Axial CT image shows patchy ground-glass opacities with associated centrilobular nodules (inset: magnified view of centrilobular nodules). Also note mild subpleural reticular opacities (black arrowheads) indicating fibrosis, and subtle mosaic attenuation (white arrowhead) necrosis or superinfection. In advanced disease, hilar retraction and compensatory emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes, is seen (Fig. 25) . The parenchymal lung manifestations related to asbestos exposure are referred to as asbestosis and differ from the previously described \"classic\" pneumoconiosis. Early asbestosis is characterized by subpleural linear and reticular opacities that are predominantly located in the posterior lung bases. To distinguish these abnormalities from gravity-related physiologic changes, prone scans should be included in cases of suspected asbestosis. Other typical findings in asbestosis include thickened interlobular septa and centrilobular nodules. In advanced disease, CT shows bands of fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing. In addition, other asbestosrelated lung abnormalities, such as pleural effusion, pleural plaques, and round atelectasis can be found.",

The most common patterns of drug-induced lung disease include: pulmonary edema and hemorrhage; diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); organizing pneumonia (OP); nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP); hypersensitivity pneumonitis; and eosinophilic pneumonia. In early drug-induced DAD (1st week after lung injury), CT shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidations, whereas, in the late phase of disease (after 1 or 2 weeks), fibrotic changes occur, such as irregular linear opacities, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis. The HRCT manifestations of NSIP consist of scattered ground-glass opacities and irregular linear opacities (Fig. 26) . The sparing of the outermost subpleural lung is highly suggestive of NSIP. HRCT findings in UIP include reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. Drug-induced OP is identical to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and manifests on CT with bilateral areas of ground-glass opacities or consolidations that are often peripheral in distribution. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually becomes clinically apparent within hours or days after institution of drug therapy and HRCT findings are similar to those caused by inhalational agents (Rossi et al. 2000) with ground-glass opacities, centrilobular nodules, mosaic pattern and air trapping and Pulmonary involvement can result in either acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (EP). Drug toxicity is a common cause of eosinophilic pneumonia and is characterized by combined lung abnormality and increased serum or tissue eosinophils. HRCT in EP shows consolidation that are typically distributed peripherally and in the upper lobe. EP usually responds well to cessation of the administered drug and is exceedingly Fig. 25 Silicosis with progressive massive fibrosis in a 72-year-old man. Coronal CT image shows a large perihilar mass in the left upper lobe. There is retraction of the hilus and marked emphysema. In addition, some scattered small nodules are present sensitive to corticosteroid therapy. Within the group of noncytotoxic drugs, methotrexate and amiodarone frequently cause drug-induced lung diseases in 5-10% of patients. The most common lung injury associated with both drugs is nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Organizing pneumonia is less commonly associated with noncytotoxic drugs (Fig. 27 ).",

Interstitial lung disease is probably most prevalent in systemic sclerosis, but is also a common problem in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mixed connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis/ polymyositis (DMPM), or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Lung involvement less frequently occurs with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The parenchymal manifestations of collagen vascular diseases seen at CT closely resemble those found in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) and can be classified using the same system. Although the proportions of interstitial pneumonias vary, the nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the most frequently encountered pattern in patients with collagen vascular lung disease, especially in progressive systemic sclerosis (Fig. 29 ). In keeping with the IIPs, the NSIP pattern is characterized by subpleural reticular opacities and varying proportions of ground-glass opacities, while in patients with UIP, honeycombing and tractionbronchiectasis are the dominant abnormality. The predominance of the NSIP over the UIP pattern might explain the more favorable prognosis in patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases than in those with IIPs (Kim et al. 2002) . Organizing pneumonia (OP) is more common in RA than in the other collagen vascular diseases and is characterized by patchy infiltrates in a peripheral distribution. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a typical, but rare complication in Sj\u00f6gren syndrome in about 1% of patients during the course of their disease (Swigris et al. 2002) , and HRCT findings include diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacities and thin-walled perivascular cysts (Fig. 30 ). In addition to the patterns of interstitial pneumonias, other parenchymal manifestations in collagen vascular diseases include alveolar hemorrhage, especially in patients with SLE, and necrobiotic nodules in patients with RA, which range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters (Remy-Jardin et al. 1994) , and are usually subpleural in distribution. The increased prevalence of malignant disorders complicating the course of some disorders such as DMPM makes volumetric CT protocols mandatory in the follow-up of these patients.",
