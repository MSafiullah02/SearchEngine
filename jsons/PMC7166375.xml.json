            "text": "To ascertain the utility of an ANM\u2010PCR respiratory pathogen panel in aiding cause of death determination, such tests were performed by six forensic pathologists on 35 of 145 coronial pediatric decedents from December 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, in the Medical and Forensic Autopsy Section of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina. The decedents ranged from 2 weeks to 12 years of age. Cases were selected for PCR on the basis of the attending pathologists\u2019 suspicion that a respiratory illness may have contributed to death. Samples were acquired via postmortem mucosal swabs from nasal, nasopharyngeal, tracheal, and/or bronchial regions. Samples were then analyzed using an ANM\u2010PCR panel of respiratory pathogens, specifically the BioFire FilmArray\u00ae\n20 (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Briefly, each sample was acquired from a patient in the form of a mucosal swab, which was placed into BD Universal Viral Transport for Viruses, Chlamydiae, Mycoplasmas and Ureaplasmas (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Specimens were transported in person to the microbiology laboratory within 2 h from the time of procurement. Upon receipt in the microbiology laboratory, hydration solution was injected into a compartmentalized pouch where the ANM\u2010PCRs occur, the patient sample was mixed with denaturing buffer and added to the pouch, the pouch was then inserted into the analyzer, and the remaining reactions and analyses were performed by the bench top instrument. Two process controls were included in each pouch, an RNA process control and a PCR2 control. The RNA Process Control assay targets an RNA transcript from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze\u2010dried form and becomes rehydrated when sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all stages of the test process, including lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, first\u2010stage PCR, dilution, second\u2010stage PCR, and DNA melting. A positive control result indicates that all steps carried out in the FilmArray RP pouch were successful. The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that the second\u2010stage PCR was successful. Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. When either control fails, the controls field of the test report will display \u201cFailed\u201d and all results will be listed as invalid. External positive and negative controls were run with each new lot of reagents.",

Rhino\u2010 and enteroviruses are grouped together because multiplex PCR tests cannot reliably distinguish between them due to their high degree of genetic similarity 3. Complete autopsies, including histology and toxicology, were conducted on each case. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, investigational techniques were not standardized. At minimum, each autopsy investigation included examination of each body cavity and organ, including the cranial cavity and brain. Histologic sections were submitted on all of the study cases and typically included heart, lung, liver, and kidney tissue. Bacterial cultures were performed in some cases at the discretion of the pathologist. Vitreous electrolytes were regularly performed on nontraumatic cases without antemortem documentation of electrolyte levels. The contribution of each positive PCR result to the cause of death was critically examined and interpreted based on the autopsy findings and known circumstances surrounding death by the certifying pathologist.",

In addition, many of the untested cases in which a natural disease process contributed to the cause of death exhibited florid disease that would preclude ANM\u2010PCR testing. However, cause of death in 33 of the untested cases remained undetermined. It is impossible to determine whether ANM\u2010PCR testing would have proved beneficial in these cases. Future, carefully standardized, prospective studies of ANM\u2010PCR in the forensic setting should be performed to develop solid guidelines for its future implementation.",

Epidemiologically, the study was limited by the small sample size, so generalizations regarding these potential pathogens in the community cannot yet be extrapolated. The respiratory pathogen panel tested did not include all existing potential pathogens, so pathogens may have been present that were not included in the panel. Furthermore, potential pathogens that were added to the panel later in the study may have been undetectable in earlier cases. The respiratory pathogen status of cases that were not tested remains unknown. The sample sites tested were left to the pathologists\u2019 discretion. The contribution of the potential pathogens detected to the cause of death was up to the interpretation of the pathologist based on all of the elements of each individual case. Thus, it is possible that two pathologists could disagree regarding the significance of potential pathogens to cause of death. The sample sites were not standardized. The postmortem intervals did not exceed 40 h, so the utility of the ANM\u2010PCR respiratory pathogen panel beyond 40 h is unclear. Also, low sample size and lack of experimental controls disallowed any measurement of sensitivity of the test at any time point.",
