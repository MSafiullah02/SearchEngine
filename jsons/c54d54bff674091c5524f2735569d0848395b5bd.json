Previous studies have shown that Q\u03b2 replicase can initiate and elongate on a variety of RNAs; however, only a minute fraction of them are recognized as 'legitimate' templates. Guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent initiation on a legitimate template generates a stable replicative complex capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid, a powerful inhibitor of RNA-protein interactions. On the contrary, initiation on an illegitimate template is GTP independent and does not result in the aurintricarboxylic-acid-resistant replicative complex. This article demonstrates that the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini of a legitimate template cooperate during and after the initiation step. Breach of the cooperation by dividing the template into fragments or by introducing point mutations at the 5\u2032 terminus reduces the rate and the yield of initiation, increases the GTP requirement, decreases the overall rate of template copying, and destabilizes the postinitiation replicative complex. These results revive the old idea of a functional circularity of legitimate Q\u03b2 replicase templates and complement the increasing body of evidence that functional circularity may be a common property of RNA templates directing the synthesis of either RNA or protein molecules. .

Also, unlike PCR, Q\u03b2 replicase displays strict amplification selectivity. Only the so-called replicable RNAs are amplified: the genomic RNA of Q\u03b2 phage and short-chained RQ RNAs, a special class of RNAs that are rarely generated in vivo or in vitro by virtue of sequence recombination and point mutations 3 , cellular RNAs and even the genomic RNAs of related RNA phages, for example, phage MS2, 7 are not amplified.",

It appears to be of a very peculiar nature. In contrast to common DNA or RNA polymerases, Q\u03b2 replicase does not utilize sequence-specific primers or promoters, and replicable RNAs share no sequence similarity except for the 5\u2032-terminal GGG and 3\u2032-terminal CCC clusters. The gross affinity to a template cannot be a basis for the observed RNA discrimination either, because Q\u03b2 replicase demonstrates similar affinities to replicable RNAs and other, including cellular, RNAs (such as most tRNAs) and only a slightly higher affinity to ssRNAs compared with dsRNAs, 8 on which it cannot initiate at all. 9, 10 Furthermore, recently, we found that Q\u03b2 replicase can copy a range of RNAs whose initiation (3\u2032terminal) regions comprise diverse sequences. In each case, a full-sized complementary strand was produced. 11 This means that each of these RNAs can serve as a Q\u03b2 replicase template and suggests that Q\u03b2 replicase can copy RNAs in an almost indiscriminative manner.",

            "text": "The apparent paradox (the strict selectivity in RNA amplification versus the lack of selectivity in template copying) was understood upon a detailed comparison of properties of an RQ RNA and its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments obtained by dividing the RNA sequence at an internal site. It was found that there are two classes of Q\u03b2 replicase templates, designated as legitimate and illegitimate, readily distinguishable by a set of criteria, the most important of which are the guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP) requirement and the stability of the replicative complex. 11 Copying of legitimate templates is strictly dependent on GTP, which is absolutely required at the initiation step, although it can be replaced by inosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ITP) during elongation. The GTPdriven initiation on a legitimate template results in a stable replicative complex that is capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), 11 a potent inhibitor of protein-RNA interactions, 12 which completely blocks RNA synthesis if added before initiation. 13, 14 The terms replicable and legitimate are not equivalent. Although all replicable RNAs are legitimate templates, the class of legitimate templates is broader. According to the above criteria, the 3\u2032 fragment is also a legitimate template, even though it is not replicable (not capable of exponential amplification). 11 On the other hand, the 5\u2032 fragment and a number of its derivatives with varied 3\u2032-terminal sequences are illegitimate templates: they are readily copied when GTP is entirely replaced with ITP, and they do not form the ATA-resistant replicative complex. ATA completely blocks the elongation of initiated strands even if initiation has occurred in the presence of a combination of ribonucleoside 5\u2032triphosphates (NTPs) sufficient to synthesize rather long (up to 7 nt) RNA stretches ('primers') and even if the template possesses a CCCC cluster at its 3\u2032 end. Moreover, even in the latter case, copying of the template, including the initiation step, does not require GTP. 11 These results indicated that the mechanisms of initiation on the legitimate and illegitimate templates are fundamentally different. In particular, the GTPdependent initiation on a legitimate template drives the enzyme into a 'closed' conformation, which is never attained with illegitimate templates. The resistance to ATA means that, in the closed conformation, the enzyme can synthesize the full-sized complementary copy without dissociation from its template; that is, it becomes highly processive. This property may be important for keeping the complementary template and nascent strand unpaired, a prerequisite of exponential RNA amplification.",

At the first step ('tasting'), Q\u03b2 replicase nonselectively binds with the 3\u2032 end of an RNA template, whether legitimate or not and irrespective of the presence of oligo(C) cluster and, if the complex lives long enough, begins to copy it. At the second step ('swallowing'), condensation of two or more GTP molecules on a legitimate template triggers the Q\u03b2 replicase transition into the closed conformation in which the template and the nascent strand remain stably bound during the entire replication round. Initiation on an illegitimate template cannot trigger this transition, and the enzyme:RNA complex remains unstable. As a result, the template and nascent strand either prematurely dissociate (are 'spitted out') or collapse into a duplex. Any of these alternatives results in early cessation of RNA synthesis and, hence, makes the exponential amplification impossible.",

Then, the three missing NTPs [ATP, cytidine 5\u2032triphosphate (CTP), and uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (UTP)] were added along with ATA, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min, which allowed a nascent strand to be elongated to the fullsized complementary copy of the template.

To this end, the replication complex was formed by 10-min incubation of Q\u03b2 replicase and RNA in the presence of GTP and Mg 2+ , then ATA was added to prevent further initiation, and decay of the complex was stopped by the addition, at the indicated time points, of the three missing rNTPs. The residual amount of the complex was measured by determining the amount of the fullsized product strands produced during the subsequent incubation of the samples for 10 min. Figure 5a shows that the half-life of a complex involving the wild-type (5\u2032-GGG) RQ135 RNA was \u2248 3 min at room temperature (22\u00b0C), which is much longer than the time needed for a one-round copying of this RNA at the same temperature (\u2248 30 s, data not shown). Point mutations at the 5\u2032 end reduced the half-life, down to \u22481 min for a complex involving the double mutant (5\u2032-GAA). Plotting the data in a semilogarithmic scale did not produce straight lines as would be expected of a simple exponential decay. However, we used this kind of presentation as it made the alterations in the decay kinetics induced by mutations easier to observe (Fig. 5b) .",

This is not because of an incomplete inhibition of reinitiation by ATA, in which case the net decay would slow down as the rate of decomposition of the replicative complex approaches the rate of its re-formation. Figure 4 demonstrates that, at the concentration used (1 mM), ATA completely, irreversibly, and almost instantly inhibited the initiation of RNA synthesis. That is why we were able to stop initiation at chosen time points and to measure the initiation rate. There can be a number of other possibilities. For example, the initiation complexes could have different stabilities if they involve one, two, or more replicase molecules. Alternatively, the heterogeneity of complexes could be induced by ATA itself (e.g., due to a variable ATA-to-replicase stoichiometry). Regardless of the source of the observed nonlinearity of the decay kinetics, the plots of Fig. 5 reflect real differences in the stability of postinitiation complexes formed with various RNA mutants.",

This cooperation does not require that the two termini belong to the same RNA strand. It can be observed even if the template is fragmented, provided that the fragments are held together by noncovalent interactions. However, the mode of cooperation depends on whether the template is intact or not. Whereas sensitivity of the unbroken RQ135 RNA to the 5\u2032-terminal point mutations increases after initiation, which is reflected by a more rapid decay of the replicative complex, a hybrid molecule composed of the supplementing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments of RQ135 RNA becomes insensitive to the 5\u2032-terminal mutations after initiation. The loss of sensitivity may be due to dissociation of the 5\u2032 fragment, or at least displacement of its 5\u2032-terminal segment, from the replicative complex after initiation. Indeed, despite the very different initial amounts of replicative complexes formed by the 3\u2032 fragment when it is present alone or is hybridized to the 5\u2032 fragment, whether wild type or mutant, the rates of decay of the complexes in the presence ATA are virtually identical (Fig. 5d) .",

They proposed the term functional circularity to designate the putative ability of a template to present to replicase its 5\u2032 end, in addition to the 3\u2032 end, at the initiation step. 20, 21 This conclusion was later disputed by Schwyzer et al. who showed that fragments substantially less than the intact Q\u03b2 RNA served as templates for the synthesis of complementary copies. 22 Later, it was shown that copying of the positive Q\u03b2 RNA strand, whose length is 4217 nt, requires long-range RNA-RNA interactions between the 3\u2032 end and an internal segment lying up to 1500 nt upstream, 23, 24 to which replicase binds with a high affinity. 25, 26 Therefore, simultaneous interaction of Q\u03b2 replicase with the two sites was thought to be the mechanism for template recognition.

[25] [26] [27] The purpose of these interactions seems to expose the 3\u2032 end, which, unlike the 3\u2032 end of other templates, is otherwise hidden in the structure of the positive Q\u03b2 RNA strand. 29 Such a complex recognition pattern may serve as an intertypic segregation mechanism ensuring that Q\u03b2 replicase will not amplify the genomes of other RNA coliphages. [1] [2] [3] The existence of the above mechanism does not exclude the possibility that once exposed, the 3\u2032 end of the positive Q\u03b2 RNA strand becomes available for interaction, either direct or through replicase, with the 5\u2032 end. The ability of Q\u03b2 replicase to interact with both the 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-terminal structures was documented for the negative Q\u03b2 RNA strand whose recognition is not complicated by the participation of proteins S1 and Hfq. 27, 28 Moreover, deletion of a hairpin near the 5\u2032 end resulted in suppression of the initiation of RNA synthesis at the 3\u2032 end of this template. 28 Finally, whenever tested, 5\u2032-terminal structures of Q\u03b2 replicase templates manifested higher affinities for the enzyme than did the 3\u2032 terminus, 11, 27, 30 consistent with a hypothesis that Q\u03b2 replicase initiates at the 3\u2032 end while bound to the 5\u2032 end. It is therefore possible that cooperation between the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini is a common property of legitimate Q\u03b2 replicase templates.",

These templates manifested functional circularity in a number of tests, such as the early kinetics of RNA synthesis, the GTP dependence, the rate of initiation, and the stability of the postinitiation complex. Although two of the three templates are not replicable, one has a broken sugar-phosphate backbone and one lacks a half of the RQ sequence; each of these RNAs is a legitimate template according to earlier established criteria. 11 We therefore conclude that functional circularity is a common feature of legitimate Q\u03b2 replicase templates, whether replicable or not.",

This idea seemingly gained support from subsequent findings that both the positive and negative strands of Q\u03b2 RNA, as well as of other replicable Q\u03b2 replicase templates, are flanked by oligo(C) and oligo(G) sequences at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, respectively. 1-3 However, the length of the putative panhandle (3 to 4 base pairs) would be too small to secure the circle termini.",

            "text": "Weissmann et al. gave another explanation for the complementarity of terminal sequences. They argued that, as far as the 3\u2032-terminal oligo(C) is required for initiation, then the 5\u2032 terminus of the positive strand must always be oligo(G) in order that oligo(C) can be synthesized at the 3\u2032 end of the complementary negative strand. 31 Furthermore, a minimum energy algorithm 17, 18 predicts that, with a few exceptions, the termini are not base-paired in the secondary structure of RQ RNA. Instead, the 3\u2032terminal oligo(C) remains ss, whereas the 5\u2032terminal oligo(G) is base-paired elsewhere, 32,33 as shown in Fig. 1b . The single-strandedness of the 3\u2032 terminus was proposed to be a general prerequisite for replication. 30, [32] [33] [34] However, the algorithm used for the prediction of RNA secondary structures 18 does not account for non-Watson-Crick interactions and for the presence of Mg 2+ ions, which are absolutely required for RNA replication, and assumes that the monovalent cation salt concentration is 1 M, at which RQ RNAs cannot replicate. 35, 36 Therefore, the predicted structures may be functionally irrelevant. Indeed, probing of RQ RNAs with ribonucleases that are sensitive to the conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone strongly suggests that, whenever tested, the 3\u2032-terminal oligo(C) is in a helical structure. 15, 37 Moreover, probing of the RQ135 RNA studied here indicated that the entire 15-ntlong 3\u2032-terminal segment (depicted with blue symbols in Fig. 1) is resistant to the single-strandspecific nuclease from mung beans but is attacked by ribonuclease V 1 from cobra venom, which is specific to the A form of RNA helix. 38 These observations could be accounted for by a model for the secondary structure of RQ135 RNA 15 reproduced in Fig. 1a . A distinguishing feature of this model is an imperfect double helix jointly produced by the base-paired termini and an adjacent hairpin, reminiscent of the helix formed by the T\u03a8C hairpin and the aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNA. 39 Such a terminal helix could potentially be formed by both the positive and negative strands of every efficient Q\u03b2 replicase template, including the genomic RNA of phage Q\u03b2, and might perform two related functions: (i) to serve as an analog of 'panhandle,' which might circularize the template even in the absence of Q\u03b2 replicase, and (ii) to serve as a specific structure recognizable by replicase. 3 The terminal helix model perfectly accounts for the present findings that initiation of RNA synthesis is worsened by mutations G\u2192 A at positions 2 and 3 of RQ135 RNA and is improved by mutation C \u2192 G at position 3 of its 3\u2032 fragment. It was therefore interesting to check whether mutations C \u2192U at positions \u2212 2 and \u2212 3 (from the 3\u2032 end) would compensate for the G \u2192A mutations at positions 2 and 3, respectively, by restoring base-pairing of the RQ135 RNA termini. The negative answer to this question ( Fig. 6) does not disprove the model; it only suggests that Q\u03b2 replicase might recognize more than just the helical backbone. For example, Q\u03b2 replicase might explore the CCC/GGG helix from its minor and/or major groove, as restriction endonucleases do when they bind to their specific dsDNA sites. 40, 41 Direct crystallographic studies of a Q\u03b2 replicase:RQ RNA complex would give a definite answer, but no crystals of Q\u03b2 replicase were obtained as yet.",

Each of the secondary structure models discussed above and shown in Fig. 1a and b is compatible with this feature of a legitimate template, as in each case the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini are not far from each other and, hence, might simultaneously be bound at the replicase active site. Initiation results in a transition of the enzyme into the closed conformation, which distinguishes the relatively narrow class of legitimate templates from a variety of illegitimate templates. 11 The present data further indicate that the termini may remain to be bound by the replicase after such a transition, as long as the 5\u2032-terminal mutations affect the stability of postinitiation replicative complexes. This finding suggests that the template circularity might perform one more functionto help keep the template and the nascent strand ss, which is vital for the exponential amplification.",

Weissmann et al. pointed out that the exponential RNA synthesis can only occur if two requirements that seem to be mutually exclusive are observed. 6 The synthesis of a complementary strand requires that it is base-paired with its template, but the two strands are to be nonpaired to provide for further replication, because a dsRNA cannot serve as a Q\u03b2 replicase template. To solve this paradox, they suggested that shortly after the incorporation of a nucleotide into the nascent strand, the hydrogen bonds binding it with the template are disrupted by the replicase as by a zipper and, once separated, the single strands are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds.",

[42] [43] [44] However, the intramolecular secondary structure cannot, by itself, prevent the complementary strands from collapsing into a duplex, given the far higher stability of the perfect double helix and the very high local concentration of complementary strands at the replicase active site. Indeed, any agent denaturing Q\u03b2 replicase, such as phenol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and pronase, results in annealing of the strands, suggesting that that important role belongs to the protein. 6 Weissmann et al. 6 and then Robertson 45 noted that if Q\u03b2 replicase could permanently bind the 3\u2032 end of the template and the 5\u2032 end of the synthesized strand, the strands would produce a 'butterfly structure' composed of two loops incapable of intertwining as needed to form a long double helix. However, similar topological constraints would exist if, instead of being bound with replicase at its 3\u2032 end, the template was circularized through termini secured by either a terminal helix or another replicase molecule. Unlike the butterfly structure capable of accommodating only one enzyme molecule, such a circle would allow a number of replicases to copy the same template, as previously reported. 46, 47 Of course, only unbroken circles could maintain the replicative intermediate ss. We would like to note that template circularity might also help in solving a similar problem of prevention of the hydrogen bonding of the template and product strands during RNA replication in the hypothetical RNA world. 48 ",

Moreover, even when circular RNAs were shown to exist, it remained unclear whether the circularity relates to template functions of a viral genome.",

This cooperation can be achieved either by direct RNA-RNA interactions (bunyaviruses, 53 orthomyxoviruses, 54 flaviviruses, 58,68,69 rotaviruses 70 , some picornaviruses 57 ) or through a protein bridge that connects the termini (other picornaviruses, 55,56 alphaviruses, 60 coronaviruses 71 ). Furthermore, the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032-terminal cooperation proved important for the translation of some viral RNAs 72, 73 and probably contributes to the translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs, which may form a circle [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] due to bridging the 5\u2032terminal cap and the 3\u2032-terminal poly(A) tail by the initiation factors eIF4G and eIF4E, and a poly(A)binding protein.

Point mutations were introduced by carrying out PCR using as templates the plasmids carrying cDNAs for the modified RQ135 RNA, 11 its 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 fragment, 16 and the primer pairs listed in Table  1 . Then, the same reverse primer and forward primer 5\u2032-CTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTAATACGACT-3\u2032 were used to extend the first PCR product upstream from site HindIII (underlined) in a second PCR, except for RQ135 sequences mutated at the 3\u2032 end only that did not need to be extended (cf., Table 1 ). The resulting products were digested at sites HindIII and either SmaI or PstI (underlined in the sequences of reverse primers, see Table 1 ) and ligated into pUC18 between the same sites. Before transcription, plasmids were digested at site SmaI (RQ135 sequences mutated at the 5\u2032 end only and the 3\u2032 fragment), PstI (other RQ135 mutants), or BamHI (5\u2032 fragment sequences).",
