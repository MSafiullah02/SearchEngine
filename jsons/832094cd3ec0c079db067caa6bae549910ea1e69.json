RT-PCR testing has substituted viral cultures as gold-standard because of the high accuracy and better timing [3] . Nasopharyngeal swabs are considered easy and quick to collect, they are not time-consuming and they can be performed anywhere, even to people sitting in a car. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered more sensitive than nasopharyngeal specimens, with a sensitivity around 97%, but its use is limited to critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. More recently, serologic tests have to gain attention for their potential of screening wider populations, identifying uninfected and/or healed subjects and thus directing future policies. So far, though, they are still under investigation and their current role is, therefore, limited [2] .",

Reaching the nasopharynx with a swab is not easy: the intranasal anatomy is highly variable (e.g. hypertrophic inferior turbinates, deviated septum, conchae bullosae, synechiae) and this factor, coupled with patients' discomfort, may result in a flawed sampling of the nasal cavity, the inferior turbinate or the middle meatus instead. We hypothesize that part of these limited results may be linked to a wrong diagnostic procedure performed collecting the swabs.",

It would be invaluable to train healthcare personnel with the aid of a live endonasal endoscopic demonstration of nasal and nasopharyngeal anatomy and sampling, and in this field the active role of the otolaryngologist becomes very relevant (Fig. 1) .",
