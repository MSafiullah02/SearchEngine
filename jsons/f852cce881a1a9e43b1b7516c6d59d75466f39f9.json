Early studies established a correlation between circulation of influenza virus in the community and concurrent increases in the incidence of severe ARI, hospitalizations for pneumonia, and influenza-associated mortality [36] . This led some to conclude that, when influenza is circulating within the community, patients with specific clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., cough and fever within 48 h after onset of symptoms) are likely to have influenza and may benefit from empiric antiviral therapy to reduce the duration of illness and the number of influenzaassociated hospitalizations [37] [38] [39] . However, these recommendations are based on retrospective pooled analysis of antiviral clinical trials, in which the inclusion criteria required presence of fever and/or symptom of fever, which may have conferred a selection bias. In our study, the major clinical differences among the most common agents-influenza, rhinovirus, and RSV-were the presence of myalgias with influenza and fever with influenza and RSV. A finding of wheezing on examination was associated with rhinovirus or RSV infection. The association of wheezing with both rhinovirus and RSV infection has been described and has been postulated to be due to increased bronchial reactivity caused by airway injury, diminished b-adrenergic function, IgE production, and enhanced leukocyte histamine release [40] . When assessing patients with nonspecific symptoms of influenza-like illness, these additional clinical clues may be of use to the clinician considering the benefits and drawbacks of prescribing antiviral therapy, which can be expensive or may have associated adverse effects. For example, the adamantane drugs are associated with CNS-related adverse events, particularly in the elderly population, and oseltamivir can cause adverse gastrointestinal effects [34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 638, "end": 642, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 648, "end": 652, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1430, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1890, "end": 1894, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that, even during the influenza season, rhinovirus and RSV are prevalent and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult ARI before prescribing antiviral medication.
