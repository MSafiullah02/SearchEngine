Although a degree of underreporting of adverse events in these databases is likely, it is worthwhile noting that hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, for instance, have been prescribed for decades to hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. In a recent study by Raoult et al. on the potential benefits of combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [5] , an ECG was performed before initiating treatment and at inpatients with more severe symptoms of COVID-19, including some in critical care, hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin prolonged the QTc to > 500 ms in 11% [6] . The development of acute renal failure was a strong predictor of extreme QTc prolongation. No lethal arrhythmic event was reported in these preliminary series. The French agency for medications safety (ANSM) reported some cases with events possibly related to hydroxychloroquine use, and recommends close follow-up on the possible adverse events of the different drugs with potential cardiac effects used off-label for COVID-",

First, there are modifiable risk factors including use of a drug that prolongs the QT interval (see crediblemeds.org), serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L, bradycardia < 50 bpm, hypocalcaemia < 90 mg/L (2.2 mmol/L), hypomagnesemia < 15 mg/L (< 0.6 mmol/L).",

Third, one could anticipate risk factors attributed to COVID-19 itself, such as myocarditis and arrhythmias, hypokalaemia and renal failure (with an associated risk of drug toxicity). As alluded to above, the short duration of treatment for COVID-19 (5\u221210 days) should be associated with a lower risk of drug accumulation and of arrhythmia than would be expected with longer-term treatments.",

For outpatients under the age of 65 years without cardiac, hepatic, digestive or renal comorbidities, an ECG does not seem to be mandatory in the absence of other QTprolonging drugs. However, if an ECG can be readily performed, it is reasonable to do so.

To manually measure the QTc, the tangent method [11] is appropriate. The QT interval should be measured in lead II or V5 and corrected for heart rate using the preceding RR interval as per Bazett's or Fridericia's formulae if the heart rate is > 90 bpm (https://www.qtcalculator.org). In case of PVC on the ECG, a marked QTc lengthening on the following sinus beat may be a marker of higher risk for torsades de pointe [12, 13] .",
