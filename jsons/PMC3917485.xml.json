Human Bocavirus has been detected in urine, fecal, and blood samples of children with gastrointestinal tract infections (4). Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) known by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in infants and children (5).\n",

This study demonstrated the presence of HBoV genomic DNA in stool samples from a group of children with acute gastroenteritis. The study is in line with previous studies in China, Australia, USA, and Brazil (14,15). The frequency of HBoV in the present study (8%) was higher than the frequency reported in the previous studies (Canada 1.5%, Sweden 3.1%, Australia 5.6%, and Japan 5.7%, Germany 10.3% and Korea 11.3%) (23). An increasing evidence suggests a relationship between HBoV and the disease. High titers of DNA in some samples suggest that the virus replicates in the human gut and none of the HBoV-positive patients showed the respiratory symptoms. The low HBoV-DNA titers in other stool samples could be explained by swallowed virus from the respiratory tract; but HBoV cannot be ruled out as a cause for single gastroenteritis cases. Control groups were used to support evidence demonstrating an association between HBoV infection and gastroenteritis (16,17). HBoV is an important agent for outbreaks of gastroenteritis in day care facilities for children (18,19).\n",
