Researches have discovered the mechanism of cisplatin resistance mainly includes: pre-target resistance (Chen et al. 2012; Kuo et al. 2012; Ishida et al. 2010); on-target resistance (Friboulet et al. 2013; Kamal et al. 2010; Olaussen et al. 2006); post-target resistance (Goloudina et al. 2012; Motte et al. 2007; Michaud et al. 2009) and off-target resistance (Ren et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2011). The susceptibility of wtEGFR NSCLC cells to cisplatin can be limited by off-target mechanisms, that is, molecular circuitries that deliver compensatory pro-survival signals even though they are not directly activated by cisplatin (Galluzzi et al. 2012).",

There are reports also revealed a EGF-independent activation of EGFR in epithelial and non-epithelial cells (Lu et al. 2014; Hardbower et al. 2016; Guo et al. 2015).

Although advances in molecular diagnosis and targeted therapies have been providing personalized therapies that translate into clinically meaningful benefits, for patients with advanced wtEGFR NSCLC, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is still the first-line treatment option (Griesinger et al. 2019). However, drug resistances are often inevitable accompanied by the long-term use of cisplatin, significantly hampering its therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes (Lin et al. 2019). The purpose of our research is to explore the mechanism of cisplatin resistance and clinical strategies to release or reduce the resistance.",

Moreover, they were more sensitive to EGFR inhibitor gefitinib than their parental cells, suggesting that cisplatin resistance is associated with abnormal activation of EGFR. EGFR is a transmembrane receptor protein and the complex cross-talk with several membrane receptors, including the other members of the erbB/HER-family (Roskoski 2014) involved in the fine regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and drug resistance (Leon et al. 2016). Its complicated downstream signaling pathways, especially PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MAPK, achieve the multiplicity of biological effects induced by EGFR activation (Cao et al. 2019). In this work, we found that the EGFR and downstream node molecules AKT/ERK in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways were indeed abnormally activated, and their activities were significantly reduced when application of gefitinib in H358R/A549R cell lines.",

The KRAS mutation has been used as a predictive marker of low sensitivity to EGFR-TKI in lung cancer cells harboring EGFR activating mutations (Timar 2014). However, whether the KRAS mutation affects the response of wtEGFR NSCLC to EGFR-TKI is still controversial (Ulivi et al. 2014). It has shown KRAS status does not affect the cell survival/growth and phosphorylation of AKT/ERK kinases in wtEGFR NSCLC (Ihle et al. 2012), the EGFR, AKT and ERK phosphorylation induced by cisplatin in our KRAS-mutated cell lines would thus not involve KRAS. And KRAS does not appear as a major determinant for the mechanism of gefitinib sensitization described in our study.",

The benefit of gefitinib has been demonstrated in mutant EGFR NSCLC as first-line treatment, but in wtEGFR NSCLC, gefitinib is restricted to maintenance therapy in pretreated patients (Choi et al. 2015; Landi and Cappuzzo 2015).

In particular, the combined effect of the two drugs was close to that of cisplatin on parental cells.
