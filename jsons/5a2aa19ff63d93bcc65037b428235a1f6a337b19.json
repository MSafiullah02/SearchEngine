The patient maintained this pressure curve throughout the robotic portion of the case, while the fraction of inspired oxygen was reduced from 70% to 50%. Repeat ABG approximately 90 min showed an improved P/F ratio from 174 to 226. When the abdomen was opened for specimen retrieval, the decrease in intraabdominal pressure predictably increased the endexpiratory eTPP to greater than 0. This reduced the PEEP to 22 cmH 2 O while maintaining an end-expiratory eTPP of 0 cmH 2 O. A positive end-expiratory eTPP indicates that the airway pressure exceeds the pleural pressure, which may lead to alveolar overdistention. At the conclusion of the case, the patient was transported to the intensive care unit and successfully extubated to continuous positive airway pressure ventilation the next day.",

Better knowledge of a patient's pleural pressures during surgery may allow an anesthesia provider to use nontraditional ventilator settings knowing that harm is not being caused by the PEEP or increased airway pressures. These maneuvers may reduce the likelihood of both atelectasis and alveolar overdistention by titrating the PEEP to an end-expiration eTTP of 0.",
