This is a follow up for history of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with recurrence after a recent upper respiratory infection (URI). She had previously been treated with omeprazole and had done well and able to stop medication but had to restart recently due to the URI/cough. Her symptoms have persisted about a month and she has a foreign body sensation in her mid-throat. She restarted her omeprazole 20 mg twice a day which seems to be helping. Pertinent review of systems is negative. Exam shows a well-developed, well-nourished and well-groomed female appearing her stated age in no acute distress and without cough at this time. Diagnosis is probably recurrence of LPR. The patient will continue twice a day omeprazole for at least another 4 weeks. She will follow up if symptoms persist and we will proceed with direct laryngoscopy to further evaluate. She was advised to contact us immediately if her symptoms worsen. Additionally, she was advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, not eat within 4 h prior to bedtime and call the office if not improved.",
