Another type of model is an SIS model in which infectives return to the susceptible class on recovery because the disease confers no immunity against reinfection. Such models are appropriate for most diseases transmitted by bacterial or helminth agents , and most sexually transmitted diseases (including gonorrhea, but not such diseases as AIDS, from which there is no recovery). One important way in which SIS models differ from SIR models is that in the former there is a continuing flow of new susceptibles, namely recovered infectives. Later in this chapter we will study models that include demographic effects, namely births and deaths, another way in which a continuing flow of new susceptibles may arise. The simplest SIS model, due to Kermack and McKendrick (1932), is",

Thus there is always a single limiting value for I, but the value of the quantity \u03b2 K/\u03b3 determines which limiting value is approached, regardless of the initial state of the disease. In epidemiological terms this says that if the quantity \u03b2 K/\u03b3 is less than one, the infection dies out in the sense that the number of infectives approaches zero. For this reason the equilibrium I = 0, which corresponds to S = K, is called the disease-free equilibrium. On the other hand, if the quantity \u03b2 K/\u03b3 exceeds one, the infection persists. The equilibrium I = K \u2212 \u03b3/\u03b2 , which corresponds to S = \u03b3/\u03b2 , is called an endemic equilibrium.",

            "text": "As we have seen in epidemic models, the dimensionless quantity \u03b2 K/\u03b3 is called the basic reproduction number or contact number for the disease, and it is usually denoted by R 0 . In studying an infectious disease, the determination of the basic reproduction number is invariably a vital first step. The value one for the basic reproduction number defines a threshold at which the course of the infection changes between disappearance and persistence. Since \u03b2 K is the number of contacts made by an average infective per unit time and 1/\u03b3 is the mean infective period, R 0 represents the average number of secondary infections caused by each infective over the course of the infection. Thus, it is intuitively clear that if R 0 < 1, the infection should die out, while if R 0 > 1, the infection should establish itself. In more highly structured models than the simple one we have developed here, the calculation of the basic reproduction number may be much more complicated, but the essential concept remains, that of the basic reproduction number as the number of secondary infections caused by an average infective over the course of the disease. However, there is a difference from the behavior of epidemic models. Here, the basic reproduction number determines whether the infection establishes itself or dies out, whereas in the SIR epidemic model the basic reproduction number determines whether there will be an epidemic.",

For measles, epidemiological data in the United States indicate that R 0 for rural populations ranges from 5.4 to 6.3, requiring vaccination of 81.5 percent to 84.1 percent of the population. In urban areas R 0 ranges from 8.3 to 13.0, requiring vaccination of 88.0 percent to 92.3 percent of the population. In Great Britain, R 0 ranges from 12.5 to 16.3, requiring vaccination of 92 percent to 94 percent of the population. The measles vaccine is not always effective, and vaccination campaigns are never able to reach everyone. As a result, herd immunity against measles has not been achieved (and probably never can be). Since smallpox is viewed as more serious and requires a lower percentage of the population be immunized, herd immunity was attainable for smallpox. In fact, smallpox has been eliminated; the last known case was in Somalia in 1977, and the virus is maintained now only in laboratories. The eradication of smallpox was actually more difficult than expected, because high vaccination rates were achieved in some countries but not everywhere, and the disease persisted in some countries.

Then R 0 = 4.00, and at the endemic equilibrium we have S \u221e = 250.13, I \u221e = 0.40, R \u221e = 749.47.

In this time interval the susceptible population decreases to 22 and then begins to increase, while the removed (recovered and immune against reinfection) population increases to almost 1000 and then begins a gradual decrease. The size of this initial \"epidemic\" could not have been predicted from our qualitative analysis of the system (10.5). On the other hand, since \u03bc is small compared to the other parameters of the model, we might consider neglecting \u03bc, replacing it by zero in the model. If we do this, the model reduces to the simple Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model (without births and deaths) of Section 9.2.",

We think of \u03c9 and N as fixed and consider \u03b2 and \u03b1 as parameters. If \u03b1 = 0, the equation (10.16) is linear and its only root is \u2212\u03b2 I \u221e < 0.

This implies, in particular, that the endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if \u03c9\u03b1 < 1. In addition, it is necessary to have sin \u03c9y < 0. There is an infinite sequence of intervals on which sin \u03c9y < 0, the first being \u03c0 < \u03c9y < 2\u03c0. For each of these intervals the equations (10.18) define a curve in the (\u03b2 , \u03b1) plane parametrically with y as parameter. The region in the plane below the first of these curves is the region of asymptotic stability, that is, the set of values of \u03b2 and \u03b1 for which the endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable.

A plausible suggestion is that since the loss of stability corresponds to a root \u03bb = iy of the characteristic equation, there are solutions of the model behaving like the real part of e iyt , that is, there are periodic solutions.

The population of the English colonies in North America grew much more rapidly than this, aided by substantial immigration from England, but the native population, which had been reduced to one-tenth of their previous size by disease following the early encounters with Europeans and Euro-pean diseases, grew even more rapidly. While some of these population increases may be explained by improvements in agriculture and food production, it appears that an even more important factor was the decrease in the death rate due to diseases. Disease death rates dropped sharply in the eighteenth century, partly from better understanding of the links between illness and sanitation and partly because the recurring invasions of bubonic plague subsided, perhaps due to reduced susceptibility. One plausible explanation for these population increases is that the bubonic plague invasions served to control the population size, and when this control was removed, the population size increased rapidly.",

It turns out that the qualitative analysis approach we have been using is not helpful, since the equilibrium (0, 0) is unstable and the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix at the endemic equilibrium have real part zero. In this case, the behavior of the linearization does not necessarily carry over to the full system. However, we can obtain information about the behaviour of the system by a method that begins with the elementary approach of separation of variables for firstorder differential equations.

This model is the same as the simple epidemic model of Section 9.2 except for the birth and death terms, and in many examples the time scale of the disease is much faster than the time scale of the demographic process. We may view the model as describing an epidemic initially, leaving a susceptible population small enough that infection cannot establish itself. Then there is a steady population growth until the number of susceptibles is large enough for an epidemic to recur. During this growth stage the infective population is very small, and random effects may wipe out the infection, but the immigration of a small number of infectives will eventually restart the process. As a result, we would expect recurrent epidemics. In fact, bubonic plague epidemics did recur in Europe for several hundred years. If we modify the demographic part of the model to assume limited population growth rather than exponential growth in the absence of disease, the effect would be to give behavior like that of the model studied in the previous section, with an endemic equilibrium that is approached slowly in an oscillatory manner if R 0 > 1.
