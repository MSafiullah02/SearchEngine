            "text": "The poor fidelity and lack of proofreading activity of the polymerases of RNA viruses cause high rates of spontaneous mutation during virus replication. These rates are estimated to range from 10\u22125 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 mutations per nucleotide per replication event (Thebaud et al., 2010). As a consequence, these viruses evolve rapidly and have high degrees of genome variability, which is a constant challenge for molecular diagnosic tests, as well as for prophylaxis and control methods such as vaccines and antivirals. Nevertheless, these high evolution rates have been exploited to understand the transmission of human and animal RNA virus infections across fine spatial and temporal scales (Cottam et al., 2006, Baillie et al., 2011, Bataille et al., 2011, Cotten et al., 2013, Gray et al., 2011, Hughes et al., 2012, Li et al., 2010, Orton et al., 2013). These studies help to increase the knowledge on virus evolution and to identify and analyse the potential origins, patterns of transmission and spread and risks of virus infections to be ready for the prediction, early detection and/or control of the disease.",

Full genome sequences of FMDV can be generated and analysed in real-time to discern the origin of outbreaks, the transmission links between infected premises, and to predict undisclosed infection to support control and eradication policies in free-without-vaccination countries (Cottam et al., 2008b, Valdazo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012). Furthermore, these approaches have also been used to monitor the genetic evolution of FMD viruses at the finest scales: such as within an individual animal (Wright et al., 2011) and during animal-to-animal transmission in experimental studies (Juleff et al., 2013). The interpretation of these data can be enhanced by using a range of models that have been recently developed that integrate sequence data with epidemiological information (Cottam et al., 2008a, Morelli et al., 2012). However, the practical use of these tools to confidently reconstruct transmission trees during FMD outbreaks is limited by our understanding of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different epidemiological units under field conditions (within-herd diversity) (Orton et al., 2013).",

FMDV sequences from the O/EURO-SA topotype were generated and analysed from samples within each of the eight infected premises (IPs) from 10 separate locations (with individual herds/flocks of animals grazing together) confirmed in a series of FMD outbreaks that occurred in two phases (that were geographically 17 km and temporally 34 days apart). Information regarding these herds and the clinical and laboratory investigations of these outbreaks has been described previously (Cottam et al., 2008b, Reid et al., 2009, Ryan et al., 2008). A particular focus of this work has been to consider the impact of sequencing only a single sample from each epidemiological unit upon the inferred transmission trees in order to help to design rapid and cost effective sequencing approaches that can be used in the event of FMD outbreaks, when sequencing all of the infected animals within the outbreak might not be possible.",

Comparison of likelihood values for nested models by likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) determined if models of positive selection (M2a, M3 and M8) were significantly more likely than models of neutral evolution (M1a and M7). Bayesian methods were used to locate specific sites that have \u03c9\n > 1 with high posterior probabilities. Preliminary data for the analysis (transition/transversion ratio and phylogenetic relationship between taxa) were carried out using TREE-PUZZLE version 5.2. (Schmidt et al., 2002).

The TCS and Bayesian analysis of all the generated 45 sequences yielded trees that exhibited clustering that corresponded to each of the infected herds, and were consistent with genetic conclusions generated in real-time during the outbreaks (Cottam et al., 2008b). However, further integration of epidemiological data (provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was required to resolve two nodes in the TCS reference tree which comprised identical sequences (Fig. 2: IP1b and IP2b, and IP3b and IP4b, respectively). Epidemiological evidence used to discriminate these herds included field observations where mixing of animals had been observed prior to the clinical cases (for the IP3b/IP4b node: FMD 2007 Epidemiology report, 21 September 2007, Defra) and the date of earliest infection estimated from FMDV lesion ages (for both the IP1b/IP2b and the IP3b/IP4b nodes, already compiled elsewhere: (Cottam et al., 2008b, Ryan et al., 2008)). Accordingly, accounting for sequence and epidemiological data, the most parsimonious order in which the premises and herds were infected was described as: IP0-IP1b-(IP2b(-IP2c))-IP5-IP4-(IP3b-(IP3c)(IP6))-IP7-IP8.",

A particular epidemiological feature of these cases was the role played by IP5 to link the two distinct phases of outbreaks that occurred during August and September. All the sequences generated from convalescent animals on this premise had phylogenetic ancestors between the two phases of the outbreaks, close to the main line of infection. An alternative hypothesis has suggested that the different phases of these outbreaks were seeded by two separate releases from the Pirbright complex (Schley et al., 2008). However, this scenario is only possible if two unlikely events had occurred: firstly un-sampled cases on IP5 would need to have identical sequences to the node shared by IP1b and IP2b (at sites different to the closest root of IP5 sequences); and secondly, and most importantly, the six nt substitutions separating the closest source to IP1b would need to have arisen independently in the proposed second release to IP5, findings that are not supported by data from experimentally infected cattle with a FMD virus from the same lineage (Juleff et al., 2013).",

These results provide confidence in the use of single samples and corresponding sequences to represent each epidemiological unit as a cost-effective approach in FMD outbreaks. In line with general limitations of sequence analysis, these approaches and alternative analysis of these datasets using a Bayesian inference framework (modified from (Morelli et al., 2012): data not shown) cannot resolve transmission events where genome sequences are too similar (and they may also be confounded by accumulation of nucleotide differences during chronic infection).",

A previous study showed that sequences obtained from probang samples were difficult to interpret since they had a high number of sites containing ambiguities, and that the phylogenetic relationship of these sequences were divergent from the main animal-to-animal transmission line (Juleff et al., 2013). This was not the case for all the probangs processed in this study, as only one of the five sequences obtained from these probangs (with similar CT values by real-time RT-PCR (Reid et al., 2009) between each other) had more than two sites with ambiguities, and although sequences with ambiguities diverged in long-length branches, they shared the same ancestor within the main line of transmission together with other sequences from probangs within IP5.",

            "text": "This study demonstrates that simple computational methods, applied to full genome sequences, can produce trees that accurately reflect transmission events in an outbreak. These methods are applicable in real-time during an outbreak, as they are only limited by the speed of sequencing. The computational analyses (alignment, TCS and MST) are highly efficient and well scalable, and they require only FG sequences as their input. Further support for using sequences to reconstruct transmission trees at high resolution has been generated for other RNA viruses infecting humans, such as influenza virus (Baillie et al., 2011), hepatitis C virus (Gray et al., 2011), HIV (Li et al., 2010) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Cotten et al., 2013) which have focussed on sequencing samples from individuals (all those available infected individuals or a representative subset of them) to determine host-to-host transmission events, or even reveal intra host infection pathways. However, the ability to resolve these events is dependent upon two factors: the sequence length (i.e. number of available substitution sites) adopted for the study, and the evolutionary rate of the pathogen. Previous transmission studies of equine influenza virus have indicated that more than one sequence per individual was considered to be required to reliably reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the outbreak (Hughes et al., 2012). However, this study was based on comparison of only 6% of the full genome of the virus, and in other work, transmission studies based on full genome analysis of avian influenza provided data to confidently define inter-herd transmission events (Bataille et al., 2011). This present study was based on consensus data from Sanger sequencing protocols. Future work in this area will need to accommodate next-generation sequencing data (Logan et al., 2014) using new protocols that may increase the number of sequences that can be handled and processed, as well as providing deep-sequencing data with high resolution of polymorphisms at individual sites (Wright et al., 2011).",
