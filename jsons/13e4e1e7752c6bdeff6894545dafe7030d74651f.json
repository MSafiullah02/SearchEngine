For each country, 28 the number of infections up to the Infection Date (23 days ago = Incubation Period + 29 Onset to Death period) and the present percentage of immune population were 30 estimated using Infection Fatality Rate, the number of reported deaths (which is less 31 prone to undersampling), and projecting back to Infection Date. We then estimated a 32 Detection Index for each country as the percentage of estimated infections that 33 confirmed cases represent. Assuming that detection remains constant after Infection 34 Date, we estimated the number of deaths and the estimated percentage of the 35 population of each country expected to be immune up to 23 days into the future. 36 Estimated Infection Fatality Rates are higher in Europe. In most countries, confirmed 37 cases currently represent less than 30% of estimated infections on Infection Date, and 38 this value decreases with time. Countries with flat curves throughout the pandemic 39 show the lowest immunity percentages and these values seem unlikely to change in the 40 near future, suggesting that they remain vulnerable to new outbreaks. Estimates for 41 some countries with low Infection Fatality Rates suggest a still steep increase in the 42 number of casualties in the next three weeks. Countries that did not control initial 43 outbreaks seem to have reached higher immunity percentages, although mostly still 44 .

However, it is widely known that they represent a small and unknown 54 fraction of the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections [1] [2] [3] [4] , we just do not know how 55 small. Especially hard to assess is the number of asymptomatic but contagious 56 infections [5] [6] [7] [8] , as asymptomatic carriers are unlikely to seek testing. 57 Elementary sampling theory and recent supported opinions [3, 6, 9] suggest that 58 CCD are highly dependent on the testing effort and sampling protocol, among other 59 factors. Unless a randomized and standardized sampling protocol of the whole 60 population is carried out, there is no a priori reason to assume they are representative 61 of the magnitude or even the speed of the spread of this or any other virus. 62 Furthermore, unless similar testing efforts are made in different countries, the data are 63 not comparable, and pooling them may provide an even worse picture of the spread of 64 the virus worldwide. COVID-19 related deaths data are reported nearly as much, but 65 there is less focus on them. These data, however, are less prone to sampling error [2,3], 66 unless a large number of COVID-19 related deaths go undetected, misdiagnosed, or 67 .

The 384 numbers for Japan (Fig 5) , for instance, suggest a high vulnerability since it shows the 385 highest estimated IFR (1.60) of all countries, a low %DI on Idt (6 %), the lowest 386 percentage of immune population (0.04%), and the highest estimated increase (111%) 387 in infections from Idt to the present, and thus a similar increase in deaths in the 388 following 23 days. We still don't know how long immunity to SARS-CoV-2 could last [4], 389 but recent modeling suggests anywhere between 40 weeks and 5 years [37] . 390 Nevertheless, immunity is unlikely to end abruptly, so the rate of any further re-infection 391 with new strains should be smoother in the future as long as herd immunity has had 392 some build-up [4,16]. However, even Belgium with the highest estimated percentage of 393 immune population (6.94%) seems far from values approaching herd immunity. 394 Although CCD have been used to estimate the number of infections [38], we 395 believe that this will usually provide poor estimates as suggested by the short and long-396 term variation in daily %DI values.

Therefore, if they can be used to estimate the number of infections,68    they may provide a much sharper picture of the spread of the disease.The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR, sometimes referred to as \"Infection Fatality Ratio\") can do just that. It is defined as the percentage of cases infected with a given71 disease, symptomatic or not, that eventually die [12]. Thus, if we know the IFR in a 72 given population and the number of deaths, we can estimate the number of people that 73 were infected around the same date in which those who eventually died got infected. The difference between the number of deaths and such estimate is an estimate of the 75 number of people who have recovered and are now immune. The drawback is that such 76 estimates provide a picture of the spread of the disease up to the date when people 77 reported death today were initially infected. That is IP+ODP days ago, where IP is the Incubation Period and ODP is the Onset to Death Period; estimated to be 5.2 [13,14] 79 and 17.8 d [12] respectively for COVID-19.

Probably the main goal is, or should be, to identify currently337    infected people (i.e. carrying the virus either with symptoms or not) in order to track and several reasons why this is not appropriate. They are rarely applied to a random sample343 of the population, but rather aimed at suspicious individuals (travelers or recent contacts 344 with other infections) or at symptomatic individuals [6,12,27]. These tests will have a 345 negative outcome if the virus was present, but is not anymore [6,9]. To solve these 346 issues, there are current efforts to develop and apply lateral flow immunoassays to 347 measure the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to random samples of the 348 population, such as the work carried out by Bendavid et al [6]. This study suggests a 50-349 85 fold increase in the number of infections compared to CCD, but see Vogel [4]. Comparing our estimates with antibody surveys once they are commonly implemented 351 should provide the ability to calibrate them, adjusting country and/or age specific IFR 352 values. A recent antibody survey in Spain [36] reported an immunity percentage of 353 people tested between April 27 and May 11 of 5% (95% IC: 4.7-5.4%), in close 354 agreement with our current estimate of 4.86% for this country (Table 1).
