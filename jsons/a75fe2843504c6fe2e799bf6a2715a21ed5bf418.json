At present, lopinavir/ritonavir is widely used for possible treatment of 2019-nCoV infection in countries that the emerging infection exists [5] . Countries like Belgium has prepared interim clinical guidance for the treatment of patients suspected of/confirmed with COVID-19. In this guideline, lopinavir/ritonavir may be used as one alternative despite the absence of sufficient efficacy data. https://epidemio.wiv-isp.be/ID/Documents/Covid19/COVID-19_ InterimGuidelines_Treatment_ENG.pdf.",

Previous molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated that there was equavalent binding affinities of lopinavir and ritonavir towards SARS-CoV 3CL pro . In addition, six and seven hydrogen bonds were detected in the SARS-CoV-lopinavir and SARS-CoV-ritonavir complexes, respectively [6] . Accordingly, inhibitors that block the cleavage function of 3CL pro can be expected to inhibit virus replication, making this enzyme one of the most attractive targets for treatment of COVID-19. Though the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) could be quite different in structure, lopinavir and ritonavir may have clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, as seen in the response against SARS-CoV [6] .",

Out of 13 clinical trials registered in China, 11 of which are randomized, open label clinical trials whereas the rest two are non-randomized, open label clinical trials showing no randomized, blinded, and placebo controlled trial registered yet (Supplemental Table 2 ). One randomized, open label clinical trial registered in China (http://www.chictr.org.cn/ showprojen.aspx?proj=48684) with trial identifier No: ChiCTR2000029308 was completed and the finding has been published at the New England Journal of Medicine on 18 March, 2020. As stated in the table, the primary end point of this trial was clinical improvement time within 28 days following randomization. According to the finding, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95 % confidence interval, 0.90-1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standardcare group though a secondary outcomes measures were found promising in lopinavir/ritonavir group [8] . This trial was initiated in severe COVID-19 patients lately and lacks blinding and well established placebo. Hence, it is too infant to conclude the poor clinical benefits of lopinavir/ritonavir as it requires randomized, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials in large cohort of patients and in all stage of the disease (mild, moderate and severe) to fully investigate the safety and efficacy of these drugs in real scenario.",

The top three countries highly affected with COVID-19 are China, Italy, and Spain [3]. As of 20 March 2020, 34 African countries have also reported COVID-19 cases [3]. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report, the total number of cases and deaths outside China has overtaken the total number of cases in China [4]. WHO has declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic and Europe as a new epicenter of COVID-19 with worst situations being observed in Italy. WHO has recommended laboratory tests for any suspected cases alongside quarantining suspects, applying social distancing and frequent handwashing to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV [4]. Despite such preventive measures, there is no recommended drug therapy officially approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19. At present, there are several classes of drugs undergoing clinical trials including RNA polymerase inhibitors (Remdesivir and Favipiravir)",
