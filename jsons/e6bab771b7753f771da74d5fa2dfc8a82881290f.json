New emerging infectious disease variants can be especially risky for older people, who are more vulnerable than younger people to acute respiratory diseases.

In Hong Kong, people aged 65 and older accounted for about one-fifth of the reported SARS cases and two-thirds of the SARS deaths in 2003 (Kinsella and Phillips 2005) , while the percentage of the older population (aged 65+ years) was about 12% in 2003 (HKSAR Government 2003 .",

Urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, intra-abdominal infections (cholecystitis, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and abscesses), infective endocarditis, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and herpes zoster appear to have a special predilection for elderly persons. The mortality rates of most of these infections are about three times higher among elderly patients than among younger adult patients with the same disease. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, perhaps several other factors such as delays in diagnosis and therapy, poor tolerance to invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, delayed or poor response to antimicrobial therapy, and greater risk and incidence of nosocomial infections contribute to this higher morbidity and mortality (Yoshikawa 2000) .",

A recent example of the worldwide spread of an infectious agent through travel is the SARS epidemic. This epidemic started in Guangzhou, province of Guangdong, China, in late 2002 and then spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Toronto (Canada), the United States, and Europe (e.g., Germany, France and Sweden). The cumulative total of probable SARS cases surpassed 5,000 on April 28, 6,000 on May 2, 7,000 on May 8, and 8,000 on May 22, 2003 (WHO 2003a .

            "text": "Another structural element for the growing importance of infectious diseases in this context of population mobility is mass migration. According to the estimate of the United Nations, in 2005 about 191 million people -3% of the world's population -were international migrants. Between 1995 and 2000, around 2.6 million migrants per year moved from less developed to more developed regions and mostly settled in the United States and Canada (Population Reference Bureau 2007). Various kinds of migrations can be distinguished such as labor migration and migration due to education. Another important group of migrants are refugees (rose from 8.7 million to 9.9 million globally during 2006) (Population Reference Bureau 2007), which have increased rapidly during the last 50 years due to interstate war, internal conflicts, political and economic instability, natural disasters (e.g., droughts), cultural and religious reasons (Saker et al. 2004) . Such a huge migration exposes people to high health hazards including the potential acquisition of infections (vulnerable populations). An example is the high prevalence of infectious diseases such as cholera and dysentery among inhabitants in a refugee camp of Zaire who had moved there from Rwanda in 1994. Normally the refugee camps or temporary shelters in low-income countries are overcrowded, and the provision of sanitation, clean water, food, and health care is inadequate. Moreover, barriers to vectors and animals carrying infectious diseases are insufficient, and person-to-person contact is amplified (Saker et al. 2004 ).",

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great deal of hope that humankind had tackled some of the worst infectious diseases through medical advances in antibiotics, vaccines, and other treatments (Brower and Chalk 2003) . Without doubt, emergency and intensive care medicines provide life-saving services, but high-tech medicines may also cause threats to patients. Increasingly aggressive medical and therapeutic interventions, including implanted foreign bodies, organ transplantations, and xenotransplantations, have created a cohort of particularly vulnerable persons and increased the risk of infections. According to the report of Weinstein (1998), nosocomial infection rates in adults and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) are approximately three times higher than elsewhere in hospitals. Artificial ventilation can lead to pneumonias and arterial and venous catheters can cause local or generalized infections due to insufficient hygiene. When a catheter is inserted through the patient's skin into a blood vessel, this can provide a route for bacteria living on the patient's skin to reach the patient's bloodstream and cause potentially lethal infection (Farr 2002) . Patients with vascular catheters and monitoring devices have more bloodstream infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci. Fungal urinary tract infections have also increased in ICU patients, presumably because of extensive exposure to broadspectrum antibiotics (Weinstein 1998). In order to prevent the rejection of organ transplants in transplantation surgery, immunosuppressive therapy that may facilitate generalized infections in immunosuppressed transplant patients is required. In patients in oncology wards with tumors, chemotherapy is beneficial for the suppression of tumor growth but may facilitate the invasion of various infectious agents -potentially leading to life-threatening generalized infections. Therefore, the mortality of tumor patients is also determined by potential side effects of medical tumor therapy. Examples are generalized infections in immunosuppressed patients due to cytomegalovirus, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and many other agents.",

The past few decades have seen an alarming increase in the prevalence of resistant microbial pathogens in serious infections (Masterton 2005). An obvious example is penicillin. In 1942, the first US patient with streptococcal infection was miraculously cured with a small dose of penicillin. Nowadays penicillin-resistant streptococcus is widespread. Increasing travel and migration probably contributes to the growth of resistance problems (Zhang et al. 2006 ). Antibiotic-resistant infections are important because they result in more prolonged illness, longer hospitalization, greater risk of death, and higher costs for the healthcare system than do infections with antibiotic-sensitive strains of the same species. The two most important causes of patients receiving antibiotic-resistant pathogens in hospitals have been the volume of antibiotic use and patient-to-patient transmission (Farr 2002) . Resistant strains are found in various types of infectious agents, such as parasites (e.g., malaria), viruses (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B), and bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA). Interestingly, the prevalence of MRSA varies greatly between different developed countries (high prevalence in the United States and low prevalence in The Netherlands), thus pointing to the challenge of reducing the burden through controlled use of antibiotics and efficient hygienic measures. Recently, multi-drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is a growing problem -particularly in Russia, the Newly Independent States, and countries in Eastern Europe -that will require increasing public health intervention efforts in the future. While the WHO strategy of directly observed treatment (DOTS) proves successful in settings and regions where it is applied, at the same time the emergence of extremely multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (XMDR), in which all known antibiotics against tuberculosis fail, poses enormous challenges for public health and necessitates the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs (see Chapter 16).",

Nosocomial infections are usually linked to sophisticated medical technology and the use of invasive devices (Allegranzi and Pittet 2007) . These infections make up a substantial proportion of the infectious disease burden in both developed and developing countries. For instance, at any time, over 1.4 million people worldwide suffer from infectious complications associated with health care (WHO 2005b). In developed countries, between 5 and 10% of patients acquire one or more nosocomial infections and approximately 15-40% of those admitted to intensive care are thought to be affected. Every year approximately 3 million people in the European Union contract a nosocomial infection, of which 50,000 die (ECDC 2007) . In 2002, the estimated number of nosocomial infections in the United States was approximately 1.7 million and the estimated deaths associated with these infections were 98,987; of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites (Klevens et al. 2007 ). The risk of nosocomial infection for patients is 2-20 times higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries (Allegranzi and Pittet 2007; Lazzari et al. 2004 ). An estimated 40% or more patients could suffer from health care-associated infections which are preventable and every day 4,384 children die due to such infections in developing countries (WHO 2005a) .",

Due to modern transportation systems, food grown in one country can now be transported and consumed all across the world. A person can be exposed to a foodborne illness in one country and expose others to the infection in a location thousands of kilometers from the original source of infection (ECDC 2007; Elmi 2004) . Food can be contaminated in one country and cause outbreaks of foodborne diseases in another one due to globalization of food trade (Sanders 1999). International trade has three main consequences: (i) the rapid transfer of microorganisms from one country to another; (ii) the time between processing and consumption of food is increasing, leading to increased opportunity for contamination and time/temperature exposure of the products and hence the risk of foodborne illness; and (iii) people are more likely to be exposed to a higher number of different strains/types of foodborne pathogens (Elmi 2004) .",

People demand a wider variety of food than in the past and nowadays almost every type of fruit is available on the international food markets the entire year round regardless of seasonal changes in growth. Long storage of food and the increased use of refrigeration to prolong the shelf-life of food may lead to its deterioration -including the development of infectious agents. Changing lifestyles such as going to restaurants frequently, eating foreign cuisine, and consuming fresh fruits and vegetables also increase the risk of foodborne diseases (Elmi 2004) .

For migrants, the access to health-care services may be reduced due to cultural or language barriers. Also for poorer native inhabitants of a country, the utilization of health-care services is less efficient compared to representatives of the high socioeconomic class. Due to recently growing levels of social inequality, not only in developing countries but also in developed ones, these problems are currently increasing and will probably continue to increase in the future.

During the 20th century, world average surface temperature increased by approximately 0.6 \u2022 C and approximately two-thirds of that warming occurred since 1975. Climatologists forecast further warming along with changes in precipitation and climate variability during the coming century and beyond. Climate change influences the functioning of many ecosystems and is a major threat to human health in lower income countries, predominantly within tropical and subtropical countries (WHO 2003b) . This is of major importance for the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases because the breeding sites of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and many others are extended. Generally, warmer temperatures enhance vector breeding and reduce the pathogen's maturation period within the vector organism. It is estimated that if the global temperature increased by 2-3 \u2022 C, the number of people who are at risk of malaria would increase by around 3-5%, i.e., several hundred million. In 2030, the estimated risk of diarrhea will be up to 10% higher in some regions than it would have been without climate change (WHO 2003b). In existing endemic areas the spread of vector-borne infections is facilitated and the endemic regions themselves may grow, with a consequence that, in the future, parasitic diseases will occur in areas not yet or not anymore endemic for these infections (see Chapter 3).",

Flooding has always occurred due to seasonal variations and special weather conditions such as monsoon rains and others. What is alarming, however, is the amount of rainfall and the frequency with which it occurs not only in flooding endemic regions like India and Bangladesh but also in areas that until recently have only rarely or never been affected by heavy rains. It is obvious that waterborne infectious agents can multiply at much higher rates under such conditions. Rainfall can also influence the transportation and dissemination of infectious agents, while temperature affects their growth and survival (WHO 2003b November 15, 2007 (United Nations 2007 , led to the spread of infections in the affected regions. Briefly, climate changes cause population displacement, crowding, inadequate shelter, poor access to safe water, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, unsafe food preparation and handling practices, malnutrition, poor access to health services along with huge logged water as a result of severe flooding/cyclones/tsunamis, all of which increase the risk of waterborne, foodborne (cholera, typhoid, Shigella dysenteriae), and vectorborne diseases (malaria, typhoid, dengue) among the affected people (WHO 2007; Khasnis and Nettleman 2005; Wilder-Smith 2005) .",

For 200 years, the proportion of the population living in cities has constantly been rising: from approximately 3% in the year 1800 to approximately 13% in 1900 , 29% in 1950 , 38% in 1975 , 47% in 2000 , and 49% in 2005 (United Nations 2006 Moore et al. 2003; Dadao and Hui 2006) . While the whole world has been predominantly rural until 2005, now the world is on the verge of becoming more urban than rural for the first time. In 2008, more than half of the world population lived in urban areas (Population Reference Bureau 2007) . By 2030, urban dwellers will make up roughly 60% of the world's population. Cities offer the lure of better employment, education, health care, and culture; and they contribute disproportionately to national economies (Moore et al. 2003) . Whereas until World War II urbanization had primarily been a major feature of developed countries, after World War II, urbanization processes were increasingly observed in the developing world also due to intensified industrialization and migration processes.",

Planetearth (2005) and the German National Committee on Global Change Research (NKGCF 2005) defined megacities as the metropolitan areas with more than 5 million inhabitants. The United Nations (UN) coined the term megacities to describe cities with 8 million or more inhabitants but its present threshold for a megacity is 10 million (Hinrichsen et al. 2002; United Nations 2006) . Hence we distinguish three different categories: megacities from 5 to <8 million inhabitants, megacities from 8 to <10 million inhabitants, and those with a population above 10 million citizens. The future growth is predominantly expected in developing countries, particularly in south Asia, southeast Asia and China. The overall growth of the urban population from 1970 to 2025 is expected to be much higher in developing countries than in developed countries. It is estimated that by the year 2030 approximately 4.9 billion people will live in urban areas (United Nations 2006) .",

Besides their high population densities, megacities are often characterized by uncontrolled spatial expansion, increasing traffic volumes, and severe infrastructural deficits that may represent manifestations of a loss of governability. The latter can lead to unregulated and disparate land and property markets, resulting in an insufficient housing provision. In these megacities a trained and highly specialized workforce can be distinguished from a cheap labor market, and accordingly a formal economic sector can be distinguished from an informal economic sector.",

Higher air and surface temperatures in combination with other environmental conditions, especially in big cities, make them \"urban heat islands.\" Higher temperature in these cities is caused by daytime heat retained by the fabric of multi-storied buildings and by a reduction in cooling vegetation (Grimm et al. 2008; Kovats and Akhtar 2008) . However, low temperature levels, frost, and avalanches can also harm megacity populations. Man-made hazards, which can be distinguished from environmental hazards, may lead to pollutions of air, water, and soil, to accidents with a much higher burden in developing countries (e.g., car crashes), to large-scale fires, and to industrial explosions and releases of toxic gas (see Kraas 2003 for details and examples) .",

Here we want to highlight some factors that influence the occurrence of infectious diseases in megacity populations (Fig. 2.1) . With respect to the climate, it is noteworthy to mention that most megacities are located in tropical and subtropical areas predisposing their inhabitants to tropical diseases. Housing conditions can be characterized by poor sanitation and sewage disposal, overcrowding, and a high prevalence of vermin, which may transmit infections. A poor infrastructure may lead to a high contact rate in, e.g., buses and trains (due to overcrowding) and to a lack of adequate water supply and health-care services (e.g., vaccinations) and therefore facilitates the occurrence of outbreaks and epidemics. The clean water supply may be insufficient, particularly in marginal settlements or slums, and available water can be heavily contaminated by infectious agents due to discharge of untreated industrial wastes, leaching from waste dumps into surface and water, inadequate treatment of sewage, and poor solid waste management. Sanitation may be poor, rivers may be contaminated, and sewage and garbage disposal may be missing. Prostitution enhances the spread of sexually transmitted infections (e.g., HIV) and immigration can lead to the import of infections. Educational deficits particularly in women and mothers facilitate unsafe practices and deficient services for their children (e.g., in the case of diarrheal diseases). Knowledge deficits also arise when important information on outbreaks or epidemics is only insufficiently distributed to the general public. Moreover, healthcare system services may be characterized by scarce or lacking equipment (posing problems with sterility), poor overall hygienic standards, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, and low vaccination rates.",

In collaboration with microbiologists, infectious disease epidemiology characterizes the features of the pathogen as well as its virulence, its pathogenicity, and, where appropriate, its resistance. It also specifies different molecular subtypes and strains of the pathogens (see also Chapter 7). Another vital task of infectious disease epidemiology is to investigate outbreaks. This investigation includes verifying, confirming the diagnosis, developing a case definition and case finding, describing the data in terms of time, place, and person, identifying risks, formulating and testing of a hypothesis, planning for further studies, establishing control measures, and communicating the findings to prevent larger epidemics (see Chapter 9).",

Mathematical modeling in combination with health economic analyses supports public health experts and policy makers in designing effective public health policy to best protect populations from detrimental effects of infectious diseases.

To control and eradicate malaria, proper physical and social planning, understanding the geography, entomology, epidemiology, behavior, and lifecycle of malarial parasites, cooperation between the policy makers, malaria specialists, neighboring countries, and international communities are important (Woube 1997) . Increasing population mobility and large-scale migrations within and between countries in association with rapid urbanization have particularly profound implications for the ecology of infectious diseases, interacting in complex ways with other biological and social factors and opening multiple pathways for the emergence of new infections and the resurgence of existing ones. Therefore, collaboration between ecologists, urban planners, and epidemiologists is extremely important (Eisenberg et al. 2007) . Quantifying the contributions of various factors to emergence and spread of infections requires expertise from statistics and mathematics. Dedicated efforts from many other partners such as local and state health departments, agencies, professional societies, universities, research institutes, health-care providers and organizations, domestic and international organizations are also needed to effectively organize infectious disease control and prevention.",

At the national level, coordination among public health authorities at all levels of government needs to be substantially enhanced and developed in conjunction with mechanisms that allow for greater interaction across state borders and local boundaries. Greater involvements with private sectors are also important in relation to the research, development, and manufacture of vaccines and antibiotics and the development of microbial surveillance technology. Increased state investment is critical to develop a functional and coherent national policy for combating infectious disease.
