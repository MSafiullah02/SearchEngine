Masks 3 and 4 were\ndesigned with the same feature (silicone thinning and spreading outward) but with\nslightly different cross-sectional profiles. The leakage ratings for both were\ndifferent, indicating that the resistance to leakage of this design concept is\nsensitive to the cross-sectional profile. We observed that thin silicone walls such\nas in masks 3\u20135 and fully compliant silicone design such as in mask 10 were\nunable to resist leakage against the pressure generated by the BiPAP machine.
