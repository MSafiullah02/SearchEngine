By mid-March 2020, more than 80,000 patients had been diagnosed with the disease in China, with 3000 deaths. The Chinese government has initiated a joint prevention and control initiative to prevent the spread of this COVID-19 epidemic. This coronavirus has spread to 44 countries on all continents except Antarctica, and transmission of COVID-19 in Italy, Iran and the Republic of Korea has brought the total number of infected cases in these three countries to nearly 35,000 as of March 14, 2020, from less than two percent that number just three weeks before. The situation is becoming worse daily, although in mid-March 2020, the number of new cases in China dropped noticeably.",

However, traditional Chinese medicine has been playing a critical role in the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of the COVID-19 (Ren, Zhang, & Wang, 2020). According to recent data collected by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named \u201cLung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction\u201d, of which the main components are carbohydrate polymers, has shown notable therapeutic effects on COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020). Specifically, 214 confirmed cases in four provinces were administered with this drug for three treatment courses between January 27 and February 5, 2020, with more than 60% of patients showing obvious improvement in symptoms and computed tomography (CT) manifestation, the remaining 30% being stable without deterioration (Ren et al., 2020). As a result, the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction was deployed in 4 mobile \u201cFangcang\u201d hospitals in the epicenter city, Wuhan, which were temporary hospitals to quarantine mild cases. This decoction showed satisfactory efficacy, with nearly all the patients recovering from the symptoms of fever, fatigue and cough, according to the data collected in 66 designated medical institutions in 10 provinces (Stated by National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, http://www.satcm.gov.cn).",

Even though this TCM has been used clinically for a long time in improving symptoms of fever, cough and fatigue as well as lung condition, and recently manifests definite therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patients (Ren et al., 2020; K. Zhang, 2020), its active ingredients remain unknown. This is probably because this TCM decoction has 21 herbal components which is derived from several classic recipes in a traditional Chinese medicine work. The complex constituents of Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction makes it a hard work to deeply explore its active ingredient in a short time.",

Polysaccharides generally have a rather low toxicity, and generally contain hundreds or even thousands of monosaccharide units (Delattre, Fenoradosoa, & Michaud, 2011). These polar macromolecular compounds are usually readily soluble in water. By employing the principle of \u201csimilar miscibility\u201d, polar macromolecular polysaccharides are extracted in boiled water. The present review summarizes the polysaccharides isolated by hot water extraction, which is consistent with the preparation method of Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction. So, we supposed that the polysaccharides are important activate ingredients in Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction and polysaccharides may play a vital role in treating COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has been realized that an effective body immune response plays an important role in the elimination of the virus and the prognosis of the disease (Chen, Zhou et al., 2020). Viruses are intracellular parasitic non-cellular microorganisms, and cellular immunity plays a leading role in eliminating viral infections (Li et al., 2020). From the perspective of general viral infections and individual immune responses, Immunomodulatory drugs have thus attracted attention, because artificial passive immunity induced by administrating immunomodulatory drugs can rapidly enhance cellular immunity and may help fight viral infection. For example, clinical studies have found that the immunomodulatory thymosin drugs can increase the therapeutic effect of viral infections including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and rotavirus (Ciancio et al., 2012). The immunomodulatory effects of macrolides are also beneficial in pneumonia or chronic pulmonary inflammatory syndromes, decreasing disease severity and mortality (Kovaleva et al., 2012). Immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and NK cells are the main targets of coupling between immunostimulatory polysaccharides and specific proteins (Altan-Bonnet & Mukherjee, 2019). Polysaccharides with immunostimulatory activity can directly or indirectly interact with the host immune system, initiating a series of molecular interactions, leading to the activation of the immune system (Xie, Hao et al., 2016).",

            "text": "An immunomodulatory activity is one of the most significant properties of polysaccharides (Wang et al., 2020; Wu, Feng et al., 2020). In the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction, there are a number of immunomodulatory polysaccharides, as follows. Glycyrrhiza polysaccharide can activate the immune system by promoting the maturation, differentiation and reproduction of immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as activating the reticuloendothelial system (Ayeka, Bian, Githaiga, & Zhao, 2017; Cheng, Wan, Wang, Jin, & Xu, 2008; He et al., 2011; Hong, Wu, Ma, Liu, & He, 2009; Yang & Yu, 1990). The immunomodulatory effects of Bupleurum polysaccharides have been demonstrated by enhancing phagocytic functions of murine peritoneal macrophages including phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes, chicken red blood cells, and IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (Cheng et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2012; Matsumoto, Guo, Ikejima, & Yamada, 2003). Of note, polysaccharides in water extract of Bupleurum manifests anti-complementary activity, whereas the ethanol extract of that didn\u2019t show any activity (Xie et al., 2012). Ephedra polysaccharides isolated by hot water extraction contain four homogeneous fractions, of which ESP-B4 exhibits the highest bioactivity, which may be ascribed to its higher content of GalA and branches (Kuang, Xia, Yang, Wang, & Wang, 2011). Poria cocos polysaccharide, an oral drug approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for treating hepatitis, cancers and other diseases (Li, Ma, & Zhang, 2019), is able to enhance both cellular and humoral immunity in mice (Lee et al., 2004; Ma, Chang, Chang, & Wu, 2010; Tian, Liu, Pu, & Bao, 2019), and thus show potential as an adjuvant in vaccination (Zhang, Cheng et al., 2019). Chinese yam polysaccharides can be efficacious for immunomodulatory functions and immune enhancement, and also act as adjuvants in developing vaccines (Luo et al., 2017, 2016). Polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide is a potent activator of B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, manifesting significant ability to enhance innate immune function (Dai et al., 2012; Huang, Li, Chen, Liu, & Wang, 2019), probably via the activation of the TLR-4 signaling pathway (Li & Xu, 2011; Li, Xu, & Chen, 2010). Rhizoma Atractylodis polysaccharide promotes productions of NO, ROS and cytokines, enhancing immune response and immune function via a pivotal interaction network including NF- \u03baB and JAk-STAT signaling pathways (Xu, Fang, Wang, Zhang, & Hu, 2020). In general, the relation between immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides and their structures remained obscure. Some studies speculated that the complete structure, high molecular weight and basic structure-oligosaccharide unit were highly desired for the immunomodulatory action polysaccharides (Yan et al., 2003). Based on the sugar composition analysis, some investigations suggested that polysaccharides composed of glucan were known to stimulate the immune system (Kuang, Xia, Yang et al., 2011).",

A cytokine storm, a term initially proposed in 1993 (Ferrara, 1993), is considered to be an important signal for the transformation from ordinary patients to progress to severe and critically ill, and it is also the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which are the leading causes of COVID-19 death (W. Zhang, 2020). A direct suppression on the lung inflammatory response seems warranted as the cytokine storm may be relieved after inflammatory therapy. Previous studies had demonstrated the benefits of anti-inflammatory agents in lung diseases. Drugs that target inflammation have been shown to slow the decline in lung function and improve survival (Konstan et al., 2011; VanDevanter et al., 2012). Ibuprofen, a commonly used anti-inflammatory drug, is recommended for the long-term treatment of airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis lung disease (Flume et al., 2007).",

It was reported that polysaccharides consisting of Gal, Glc, GalA and Rha revealed potent anti-inflammatory activity (Capek et al., 1988). The anti-inflammatory polysaccharides in the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction may play crucial roles in suppressing the cytokine storm, thus effectively treating mild COVID-19 patients and blocking the conversion from mild cases to severe stage. As an example, an acid component of Ephedra polysaccharide, ESP-B4, possesses obvious protective effects on pulmonary inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis, by reducing the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 (Liang et al., 2018), and inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway (Wang et al., 2016), respectively. A polysaccharide from Scutellaria baicalensis may be a drug candidate in treating colitis via suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Cui et al., 2019b). Bupleurum polysaccharide can significantly relieve lung injury in an acute pneumonia model by inhibiting P-selectin-mediated recruitment of neutrophils rolling along the CHO-P cells (Sun et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2014, 2018). A Poria cocos polysaccharide can suppresses the production of IP-10, the marker of interferon (IFN)-c-induced inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its anti-inflammatory potential (Lu et al., 2010). Pachyman, a kind of Poria cocos polysaccharide, shows antinephritic effect in rats with nephritis, probably via the inhibition of inflammation caused by C3 deposition in the glomeruli (Chihara, Hamuro, Maeda, Arai, & Fukuoka, 1970; Hattori et al., 1992).",

Oxidative stress and inflammation can act together to form a positive feedback cycle (Mittal, Siddiqui, Tran, Reddy, & Malik, 2014). Under normal circumstances, the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body maintains an oxidation-antioxidation balance, which plays an important role in regulating signal pathway transduction and cell proliferation (Cao et al., 2019; Forrester, Kikuchi, Hernandes, Xu, & Griendling, 2018). When the balance is broken by inflammatory factors, the body will produce an oxidative stress response, leading to cell oxidative damage and development of multi-system diseases (Kruk, Aboul-Enein, Kladna, & Bowser, 2019; Sies, 2015). Oxidative stress in turn activates multiple signaling pathways to induce inflammation, such as activation of NF-\u03baB and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), further promoting the maturation of pro-inflammatory factors (Ahmad & Ahsan, 2020). Vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, has been demonstrated to play a role in lowing the incidence of pneumonia in several controlled trial with human subjects (Hemila, 2017).",

            "text": "A large body of researches suggest that many polysaccharides possess anti-oxidative properties (Yu et al., 2018), which may be critical to their multiple pharmacological activities. Bupleurum polysaccharides have been demonstrated to exert definite protective effects in murine lung-injury models (Cheng et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012). Specifically, this kind of polysaccharide can reduce the degree of acute lung injury by reducing the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (Xie et al., 2012). Ephedra polysaccharide can significantly increase the activity of SOD and reduce the production of MDA, thereby protecting the liver from free radical and lipid peroxidation damage on hyperlipidemic mice (Fan et al., 2015). Glycyrrhiza polysaccharide has significant ability to scavenge hydroxyl, superoxide radical and DPPH radicals in vitro, and also enhances the SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAOC activities in vivo (Hong et al., 2009; Zhang, Yu, Liang, & Chen, 2015). It was shown that glycyrrhiza polysaccharide with lower molecular weight and higher ratio of glucose exhibited more effective antioxidant activities at the same concentration (Zhang, Yu, Liang, & Chen, 2015). This phenomenon may be explained as a high molecular weight polysaccharide possesses a high viscosity, which may have great influence on its bioactivities (Chen, Lu, Cheng, & Wang, 2005). Two kinds of antioxidative polysaccharides, named PUP60S2 and PUP80S1, were isolated from Polyporus umbellatus, among which PUP60S2 showed higher antioxidative activity (He, Zhang, Zhang et al., 2016; He, Zhang, Wang et al., 2016). This may be ascribed to more uronic acid residues and a higher level of branching of PUP60S2 when they have similar structures, as demonstrated that higher degree of polysaccharide branching is beneficial for exerting antioxidant activity (Zhao et al., 2014). Poria cocos polysaccharide can significantly relieve ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress via the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (Tang et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2020). It was demonstrated that Poria cocos polysaccharides extracted by different methods manifested different antioxidative properties, with microwave-assisted extraction possessed best antioxidant activity (Wang et al., 2016). Rhizoma Atractylodis polysaccharide acts as a potent antioxidant by reducing NOS activity, increasing SOD and GSH-Px activities, and decreasing NO and MDA contents in mice (Han et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2011). Ginger polysaccharides also shows high oxidation resistance in several studies (Chen, Yuan, Wang, Qi, & Cheng, 2019; Wang, Wei et al., 2018).",

            "text": "The composition of intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health and plays a vital role in maintaining physiological balance. Intestinal microbiota acts as a protective mediator during pneumococcal pneumonia by enhancing primary alveolar macrophage function (Schuijt et al., 2016). It has also been demonstrated that modulating gut microbiota can reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia and enteritis (Bradley et al., 2019). Probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can stimulate the immune system and reduce serum lipids, while increased amounts of pathogens like Enterococcus and Clostridium perfringens may cause diseases (Buffie & Pamer, 2013; Gerritsen, Smidt, Rijkers, & de Vos, 2011). The risk of heterotopic intestinal flora is increased if the intestinal mucosal immune barrier is in a vulnerable state, when microbiota dysbiosis makes patients prone towards secondary bacterial infections (Gao, Chen, & Fang, 2020). COVID-19 patients show intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased levels of certain probiotic microbiota, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Even though there is currently no direct clinical evidence proving that modulation of gut microbiota has a therapeutic role in treating COVID-19, we suggest that modulating gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic strategy or at least an adjuvant therapeutic choice (Konig & Brummer, 2020). The latest version of \u201cDiagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia\u201d(\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\u8bca\u7597\u65b9\u6848), published by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, suggests using intestinal microbiological regulators to maintain the intestinal microecological balance in severe and critical cases.",

In a study on the effect of Bupleurum polysaccharide on diabetic nephropathy in mice, the ratio of phyla Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes, which has been widely regarded as the marker of gut microbiota homeostasis, was elevated in diabetic mice but could be reversed by a supplementation of Bupleurum polysaccharide (Feng et al., 2019). In addition, the abundances of Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were also increased after polysaccharide treatment, among which Ruminococcus is a probiotic that is found dominantly in healthy gut (Ma et al., 2018), and Oscillospira may relieve inflammation by utilizing host glycans as growth substrates (Konikoff & Gophna, 2016). Butyrate is an essential energy source that can influence microbial environment and protect the host against the pathogenic bacteria (Cani, 2018). It is noteworthy that Roseburia, a bacterium producing butyrate (Delzenne, Cani, Everard, Neyrinck, & Bindels, 2015), was also elevated after polysaccharide intervention. These results suggest that Bupleurum polysaccharide may alleviate gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, including proliferating butyrate-producing ones.",

Further, Poria cocos polysaccharide significantly reduces the abundance of the pro-inflammatory bacteria Megamonas and Proteus, by 120- and 101-fold, respectively (Byndloss et al., 2017).

However, according to the data collected by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, clinical practice in Chinese hospitals has reported that TCMs have definite therapeutic actions at the early stage of disease (Liu et al., 2020), while common antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, Arbidol and Lopinavir/Ritonavir failed to cure these patients (Cao et al., 2020). As the main component of the medical practice, TCM has been used for more than 5000 years in China in treating human diseases (Li & Kan, 2017). It is a natural chemical library which leads to synergistic actions through multiple mechanisms. Modern medical research has demonstrated that polysaccharides are one of the main active ingredients of TCM (Liu, Sun, Liu, & Yu, 2012; Zheng et al., 2019). In recent decades, polysaccharides extracted from medicinal plants are attracting increasing attention due to their significant bioactivities, such as antioxidant activity, anti-viral activity and immunomodulatory activities (Xie, Jin et al., 2016). In addition, they are non-toxic and rarely show side effects, making them suitable as medicinal candidates. This review examines the underlying actions of TCM in the aspect of polysaccharides. It would appear that the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and regulating gut balance activities of these polysaccharides play the most important roles in the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients.",

In the development of a novel vaccine, adjuvants are a vital component because they boost and accelerate the innate immune response (Xia et al., 2018). Producing vaccines with polysaccharides as the adjuvants is an innovative strategy. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has made an effort to discover active ingredients from natural products for clinical use, due to their low toxicity. Polysaccharide-based vaccines have the potential to be adjuvants. For instance, Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide improves the effects of various vaccines, by acting as an immune adjuvant (Guo et al., 2014). Bacterial capsular polysaccharides vaccines have shown significant effects in the prevention of pneumonia and epidemic meningitis (Yu et al., 2018). Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae Hib polysaccharide vaccine have been successfully applied to prevent encephalitis. From a clinical view, TCM polysaccharides are very promising to act as new adjuvants in the formulations of vaccines, due to their universal immunomodulation and promotion effects, safety and biocompatibility. These data have proven the adjuvant benefits of the active polysaccharides from TCM, which may represent an attractive source of the vaccine development against COVID-19.",
