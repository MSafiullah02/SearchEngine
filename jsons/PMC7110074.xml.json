Frequently, there are multiple infections with respiratory viruses, including RSV, and bacteria that cause community-acquired respiratory diseases, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. There is evidence for a positive correlation between infections with S. pneumoniae and RSV in the pathogenesis of otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis (Kim et al., 1996; Andrade et al., 1998; Hament et al., 1999; Chonmaitree & Heikkinen, 2000).",

These bacteria interact with the PAF receptor via phosphocholine, which is a component of the bacterial cell surface. Haemophilus influenzae lipooligosaccharides contain phosphocholines in their carbohydrate chain (Swords et al., 2000). An enhanced adherence of live and heat-killed S. pneumoniae cells is observed in human epithelial cells infected with RSV (Hament et al., 2004). The upregulation of PAF receptor expression induced by infection with respiratory viruses, including RSV, results in the enhanced adherence of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to respiratory epithelial cells (Ishizuka et al., 2003; Avadhanula et al., 2006). The PAF receptor expression and S. pneumoniae cell adhesion are also upregulated by exposure to acid, which cause tissue injury and an inflammatory response (Ishizuka et al., 2001).",

            "text": "An antimicrobial agent, fosfomycin, has various applications and indications, including upper and lower respiratory infectious diseases, in Japan, European countries, and other countries, whereas the current indication is limited to urinary tract infections in the United States. Fosfomycin inhibits the biosynthesis of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, which is an early step of peptidoglycan synthesis. Fosfomycin shares broad-spectrum antibacterial activities and synergistic activities with various antibiotics including \u03b2-lactams (reviewed in Popovic et al., 2009). In addition to its antibacterial activities, fosfomycin is suggested to have immunomodulatory properties, such as the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, as shown by in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence (Morikawa et al., 1993a, b, 1996, 2003; Matsumoto et al., 1997, 1999; Honda et al., 1998; Ishizaka et al., 1998; Okabayashi et al., 2009). A mechanism for the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines is indicated to be inhibition of transcription factor NF-\u03baB activity, which plays a key role in inflammatory responses (Yoneshima et al., 2003; Okabayashi et al., 2009). PAF receptor expression is also regulated by NF-\u03baB (Mutoh et al., 1994; Shimizu & Mutoh, 1997). Indeed, an NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), suppresses acid-induced PAF-receptor-mediated S. pneumoniae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells (Ishizuka et al., 2001). In the present study, we examine the effect of fosfomycin on PAF receptor expression and bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells induced by RSV infection.",

Following five 12-h passages in CDM containing 200 \u03bcg mL\u22121 ethanolamine, similar passages were performed in successively lower concentrations of ethanolamine (20, 2, 0.2, and then 0 \u03bcg mL\u22121). The resulting mutant was capable of growth in CDM without choline or ethanolamine. The cell wall fraction was prepared as follows: cells grown to the mid-log phase were harvested and immediately boiled with saline containing 4% SDS for 20 min. The boiled cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 min. The pellet was washed extensively with saline, and then used as a cell wall fraction. The content of choline in the cell wall preparation was determined using an enzymatic method (Assmann & Schriewer, 1985). The choline contents of cell wall fractions from R6 and the mutant were 435 nmol mg\u22121 and undetectable, respectively.",

The suppression of chemokine induction by RSV is due to the downregulation of NF-\u03baB activation (Okabayashi et al., 2009). Yoneshima (2003) also reported the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation by fosfomycin in the human monocytic cell line U937 and in the T-cell line Jurkat stimulated with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The PAF receptor is a receptor for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Cundell et al., 1995; Swords et al., 2000). Transcription of the PAF receptor gene is controlled by NF-\u03baB (Mutoh et al., 1994; Shimizu & Mutoh, 1997). Ishizuka (2001) showed that the specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC suppressed acid-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion to A549 cells via the suppression of PAF receptor induction. Hence, the suppression of PAF receptor expression by fosfomycin seems to be due to the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. Respiratory viruses, including RSV, induce PAF receptors and bacterial adhesion via it (Ishizuka et al., 2003; Avadhanula et al., 2006). In the present study, we showed that fosfomycin suppressed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae adhesion to RSV-infected A549 cells. The bacterial adhesion was suppressed by the PAF antagonist and the anti-PAF receptor antibody. On the other hand, the phosphocholine-deficient S. pneumoniae mutant did not show RSV-induced adhesion, which was suppressed by fosfomycin. These results indicated that the PAF receptor (host)/phosphocholine (bacteria) interaction, which is enhanced by RSV infection, was suppressed by fosfomycin through the inhibition of PAF receptor induction.",

Thus, fosfomycin is expected to suppress the enhanced bacterial adhesion to the RSV-induced PAF receptor by both an intravenous and an oral administration of clinically appropriate doses. Upregulation of PAF receptor expression and the enhanced adhesion of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be major risk factors for secondary bacterial infections after a respiratory virus infection.
