            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common, but refractory, disease in the field of orthopedics. ONFH can be divided into two categories: traumatic and non-traumatic. The former is mainly caused by hip trauma (femoral neck fracture, joint dislocation, etc.), while the latter is mainly caused by the application of corticosteroids, heavy drinking, and decompression sickness. Hormonal osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) refers to the pathological process that results from the death of femoral head active ingredients (osteocytes, myeloid haematopoietic cells, and adipocytes) caused by high doses of hormones. SONFH accounts for the top incidences of non-invasive necrosis [1].",

Within a few years, the majority of patients will develop severe osteoarthritis and will require artificial joint replacement.

Therefore, it is particularly important to search for effective treatments for keeping one\u2019s own joints. The premise of good treatment is to obtain early diagnosis and intervention.

In clinic, various cases without clinical symptoms are often encountered, and these patients are occasionally diagnosed as osteonecrosis due to other examinations. If the patient has clinical symptoms such as hip pain, there is a need to guard against the occurrence of ONFH. X-ray often reveals a negative result in the early stage of osteonecrosis.

Although the pathogenesis of SONFH has different doctrines, all approaches ultimately lead to the destruction of the femoral head blood circulation, resulting in cell death [10]. Some early osteonecrosis cases have clinical symptoms, while others are asymptomatic. It remains controversial for early asymptomatic ONFH to determine whether or not to take early surgical intervention [11]. The investigators chose medicine treatment and closely observed the patient. Our team in the animal experiment and clinical work explored the method of using non-surgical treatment for early osteonecrosis for several years. Caofang et al.

            "text": "DSA has been used in clinical practice for many years. It can clearly display the femoral head feeding artery, which can provide guidance in the clinical treatment. The main feeding artery supplying the femoral head is the supporting artery on the femoral neck that originates from the medial femoral artery (or from the inferior gluteal artery). The DSA technique can clearly reveal the blood supply of the circumflex femoral head artery and the artery of the supporting artery after ONFH [13]. The IIa/b stage is the venous stasis period. DSA revealed the prolonged intravenous phase and intravenous perfusion, and that no stenosis or occlusion was present in the input artery. The stasis can lead to increased intravenous pressure, while for the pathological changes in the femoral head in osteonecrosis, increased intraosseous pressure is one of the main causes of osteonecrosis [14]. Ficat et al. [15] measured a large amount of intramedullary pressure and found that the upper limit of normal femoral head pressure was 4.01 kPa, which was considered as an early indication of ONFH. Core decompression surgery is a simple, less traumatic surgery. Its efficiency is approximately 60\u201365% for five to ten years. Even if the long-term poor effect does not increase the difficulty of joint replacement, most scholars consider that core decompression has a certain effect in relieving hip pain, which can delay total hip arthroplasty. The effective rate in the present treatment at ARCO stage IIa/b was 80%, with core decompression, which was higher than that in the literature. This was probably because the investigators strictly complied with the surgical indications. In addition, the short follow-up time and small number of cases may be one of the reasons, and the IIc stage is the artery ischemia period. The DSA revealed the prolonged average perfusion time, arterial slender, and the prolonged microvascular phase and venous phase, with no significant delayed drainage. It was found that the core decompression effect of this period was poor. Hence, surgery of the pedicle bone graft was chosen, which has advantages with the independent arteriovenous system, without microscopic anastomosis and blood vessels around the lesion, allowing it to establish contact with the reconstruction in blood in the femoral head. Due to good disease education and timely treatment, most of the patients did not develop to the IIc period. The follow-up result was good for two cases of bone graft. However, due to the sample size, the present study did not conduct an analysis.",
