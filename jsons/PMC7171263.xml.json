            "text": "The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, emerged in Wuhan, China, in late November 2019. Reports of case-fatality rates varied dramatically across regions of China, but it was clear that this virus resulted in severe and life-threatening illness for some patients, particularly patients who are older and have comorbid chronic illness.1, 2, 3 During the few months that followed, new cases were being reported outside China at a rapid rate. The first confirmed case in the U.S. was a travel-associated case screened on January 19, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington. Six weeks later, a second presumptive case was identified roughly 10 miles from where the first case was treated.4 As of March 22, 2020, Washington state has confirmed 1793 cases and reported the known recovery of 124 people and 96 deaths. In this context, our regional health care systems are challenged to develop strategies to provide high-quality care to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given the number of patients with severe illness and the number of deaths, our UW Medicine palliative care program has been centrally involved in developing a system-level palliative care response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This strategy focused on care of hospitalized patients, as this represents the area of greatest immediate need. This inpatient palliative care response plan was rapidly developed and continues to be modified and updated at UW Medicine. This plan was developed in coordination with the health system leadership along with clinical leads from key services within UW Medicine, including the palliative, emergency, intensive, and acute care services at each hospital.",

Many of these approaches use a continuum of medical care scenarios, including conventional care, contingency care, and crisis care.5, 6, 7 These proposals highlight that the primary objective in a disaster is to remain in conventional and contingency care to avoid crisis care, which will compromise patient outcomes. In conventional care, usual resources and level of care are provided.5 In contingency care, the goal is to provide functionally equivalent care adapted from usual practices with approaches such as boarding critical care patients in postanesthesia care areas. In crisis care, there are inadequate resources available to provide equivalent care, and care is provided to the highest level possible, acknowledging that there will likely be increased mortality and morbidity as a result of scarce resources but striving to provide this care in the highest quality and most ethical way possible. We used this framework to guide the development of a palliative care strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A document was drafted that identified the areas where palliative care would likely be needed most, which led to a focus on the emergency department (ED), intensive care units, and key acute care medical services where most patients with COVID-19 would be seen. The next part of the plan detailed the form and function of the palliative care team in the context of the current capacity, a contingency capacity, and a crisis capacity. We identified the form of support as including coaching for the delivery of primary palliative care, brief and targeted palliative care consultations to address key issues, and full palliative care consultations. We focused on the primary areas of need identified as we began to see patients with COVID-19 in our health care system, including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing code status to reduce the risk of unwanted or nonbeneficial cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the context of COVID-19, identifying and addressing moderate or severe symptoms not adequately addressed through primary palliative care, and supporting family members in the difficult context of restricted visitation and possible self-quarantine.",

However, we noted that other specialty palliative care workforce exists but are assigned to other clinical or nonclinical duties, such as nonpalliative care services, teaching, or research. During contingency and crisis capacity, our strategy includes the reallocation of these staff to support the palliative care response to create the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. This approach would increase the size and reach of a palliative care team. In additionally, given that we have a multihospital system, we also developed plans for redeploying specialty palliative care workforce across sites to level-load palliative care resources.",

Given this priority, we decided that the palliative care consult service should only use PPE when absolutely necessary for the delivery of care, and the goal should be to try remote approaches through digital health and telephonic options when possible. In addition, our palliative care consult service is interdisciplinary, including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, and spiritual care providers, and our usual operating procedure often entails more than one palliative care clinician visiting a patient or family at the same time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided that if an in-person encounter is necessary, generally only one palliative care provider would see the patient in person regardless of whether the patient has COVID-19 to conserve palliative care specialists to see more patients and, for patients with COVID-19 or other PPE-using infections, to preserve PPE.",

Our palliative care specialists are charged with providing guidance for primary teams conducting these goals-of-care and code status discussions to preserve resources by avoiding unwanted or nonbeneficial use. We also strived to provide all teams with clinician discussion tools as well as consultation to assist with complex communication. These resources include an informed assent strategy for discussing do-not-resuscitate orders8 and resources for COVID-ready communication skills.9\n",
