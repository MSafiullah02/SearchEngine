The 1957\u20131960 \u201cAsian\u201d and the 1968 \u201cHong Kong\u201d influenzas confirmed that obesity and diabetes lead to a higher mortality as well as a more prolonged duration of illness even if the subjects were without other chronic conditions that increase the risk of influenza-related complications [2, 3]. During the 2009 Influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 pandemic, obesity was also linked to increased risk of severe disease and a risk factor for hospitalization and death [4].",

This unfavorable hormone milieu also leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications [8]. In the basal state, obese patients have a higher concentration of several pro-inflammatory cytokines like alpha-TNF, MCP-1 and IL-6, mainly produced by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue leading to a defect in the innate immunity [9]. When an antigen is presented, the obesity-related chronic inflammation causes a reduced macrophage activation and a blunted pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation [10]. The reduced macrophage activation after an antigen is presented explaining the poor vaccination success of obese subjects [11]; this unique obesogenic microenvironment explains the emergence of antiviral-resistant and vaccine escape variants in the obese population [11, 12]. Also B and T cell responses are impaired in obese and obese-diabetic patients, and this causes an increased susceptibility and a delay of resolution of the viral infection.",

In fact, in obese mice there is a delayed and blunted immune response, probably due to a reduced interferon (INF), adaptive cellular and antibody-mediated responses. Recently, Honce et al. found that serial passaging of a human H1N1 influenza virus through diet-induced models of obesity mice (DIO) or genetically obese mice (OB) results in a more virulent disease with an increased virulence and morbidity; in the mouse model, deep-sequencing viruses revealed several mutations in obese host-passaged viruses and an impairment of the interferon response is permissive for the generation of more virulent IAV populations. These findings are not limited by viral subtype and are also found in human studies. Diminished INF response and an increased influenza virus replication were found in normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells derived from obese subjects [16\u201318].",

Secondly, the obese microenvironment favors the emergence of novel more virulent virus strains. This is due mainly to the reduced and delayed capacity to produce interferons by obese individuals and animals [17, 18]. The delay in producing interferon to contrast viral replication allows more viral RNA replication increasing the chances of the appearance of novel, more virulent viral strains [18]. Thirdly, body mass index correlates positively with infectious virus in exhaled breath [23]. This finding was especially significant for males, which leads to the hypothesis that the higher ventilation volumes or a differential chest conformation might explain this fact [23].",

Adenovirus 36 (Adv36) is the most studied infectious agent probably associated to obesity. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses causing mainly respiratory infections which were indicated both in animal models and in humans to be contributing factors for increased adiposity [24] (Fig. 1). Atkinson et al. showed in over 500 individuals and 28 twin pairs a correlation between BMI and Adv36 positivity, with 30% of positivity in obese vs 11% positivity in lean individuals [24]. The proposed mechanisms via which Adv36 infection may lead to obesity are several: First, the increase in chronic inflammation via rise in MCP-1 (macrophage chemoattractant protein I) which is activated by NF-kB [25]. Second, a reduction in leptin expression in the adipocytes leading to lipid accumulation by a decrease in lipolysis, a down-regulation of the adipocyte genes involved in lipid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis [26]. Third, the increase in glucose uptake in the adipocytes leads to an energy surplus in the cells glucose-dependent [27]. Fourth, an up-regulation of adipogenesis is due to an improvement in adipocyte proliferation and differentiation [28]. Particularly, PPAR gamma genes and other RNA expressions factors related to adipocyte genesis increase.",

The authors hypothesize that the onset of apoptosis causes this metabolic imbalance during the late stage of the influenza virus replication process [29]. This pattern resembles an insulin-resistant condition with a reduction in the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, usually involved in the rate of carbohydrate oxidation control. PDC is an important modulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis, and insulin resistance is associated with increased skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) that phosphorylates and inactivates PDC. Increased PDK4 expression in muscle has been observed in insulin-resistant status, including obesity [14, 30]. In mice infected by the H1N1 virus, there is a marked down-regulation of PDC activity and ATP level, with selective up-regulation of PDK4 in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver and lungs.",

In addition, physical exercise causes an improvement in the hormone milieu increasing adiponectin and insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin and leptin levels, reversing the altered hormone milieu of obese patients (Fig. 1). Along this line, Zheng et al. showed that regular exercise enhances the immune response against microbial antigens in humans [19]. It is interesting to note that positive immunomodulation can be achieved only with mild-to-moderate intensity exercise. In contrast, high-intensity or prolonged exercise (like running a marathon) is known to deplete the immune response, mainly due to the increase in endogenous cortisol [37]. The basic cellular mechanism via which physical exercise exerts most of its effect is an activation of AMP-kinase [38].",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key regulators of inflammation and lipid metabolism, their activation results specifically in a reduction in inflammatory cytokines (as IL6, INF \u03b3) [40]. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (two PPAR\u03b3 agonists) are insulin-mimetic drugs used in type 2 diabetes with high overall potential in reducing influenza virus infection [40]. Pioglitazone seems to suppress inflammation by reducing MCP-1 expression, an important mediator of host inflammation [40]. Pioglitazone was shown to increase survival of infected mice up to 40%, and the benefit may be attributed to modulation of subject inflammatory response [40, 41]. The combination of pioglitazone and AICAR increase survival of infected mice from 30 up to 100% [41]. Therefore, metformin, AICAR and PPAR\u03b3 agonists, in combination or alone, might be studied and then used in the treatment of severe influenza in association with other antiviral/immunomodulatory drugs in the future.\n",

Being obese not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but recent evidence indicates that a large obese population increases the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually may increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, stated that isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary intervention, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following for our obese and obese-diabetic patients: 1. lose weight with a mild caloric restriction. In addition to the obvious positive effect of weight loss, caloric restriction activates AMP-kinase, potentiating the immunomodulatory effect of physical exercise; 2. include metformin and pioglitazone (when not contraindicated) in the drug treatment for type 2 diabetes; and 3. practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise in order to potentiate positive immunomodulation. Finally, present evidence suggests a prolongation of quarantine period in adult and adolescents obese patients.\n",
