Since December 2019, the world has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but the factors affecting the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well described.

There is a paucity of studies investigating the factors affecting immune response to COVID-19. In addition, there has been no detailed report for this immune response. Given the genomic similarity of 79% with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), nearly the same reaction to the immune system is expected for COVID-19 (1) . In response to SARS-CoV, both innate and adaptive immune systems are involved. SARS-CoV applies several mechanisms to overcome the immune response. First, it inhibits the rapid expression of interferon type 1 (IFN-1) (2). IFN-1 is known as the \"initial alarm\" upon encounter with the virus that modulates the immune cells to the so-called \"antiviral state\". Moreover, SARS-CoV interferes with IFN-1 signaling through inhibition of STAT-1 phosphorylation (3). The third defensive mechanism of SARS-CoV is immune exhaustion through exaggerated and prolonged IFN-1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). This process leads to the influx of activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, that in turn, results in lung immunopathology (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome) (4). Finally, the resulted so-called \"cytokine storm\" further weakens the immune system through IFN-1-mediated T cell apoptosis (5) . In this article, we aim to provide a new hypothesis to describe how the repletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate (c-ATP) can promote immunity against COVID-19. Thereafter, we justify the current knowledge regarding the characteristics of COVID-19 infection by our hypothesis and give several approaches to improve the c-ATP.",

They detect the virus by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7). Upon attachment to viral nucleic acids, TLR7 induces profound IFN-1 expression. This response recruits other immune cells and causes massive local inflammation (9) . At first glance, this robust immune response is beneficial for the elimination of COVID-19. However, two factors prevent it. First, impairment of IFN-1 signaling results in impairment of immune cell transformation to the \"antiviral state\". Therefore, they are not so effective in eliminating existing viruses (8) . Second, persistence profound inflammatory responses may lead to immune exhaustion (4) . The depletion of c-ATP can potentially enhance these detrimental processes in the following ways. In 2016, Rebbapragada et al. demonstrated the effect of ATP in the function of TLR7 by controlling the endo-lysosomal PH. They showed that ATP-depletion can increase the endo-lysosomal PH and improve the efficacy of TLR7. Therefore, ATP-depletion can potentially enhance profound IFN-1 secretion. Secondly, ATP-depletion can potentially prone the recruited immune cells to earlier exhaustion against COVID-19. Therefore, one may conclude that ATP-repletion can prevent the so-called \"cytokine storm\" and improve the cellular energy to better counteract with COVID-19.",

Smoking cessation is the second approach to improve mitochondrial capacity and improvement in c-ATP (as mentioned above). Consuming foods with low specific dynamic action (SDA), as the energetic budget for consuming food, can potentially boost the immune system through improving the c-ATP.
