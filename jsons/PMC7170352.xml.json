            "text": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs characterized by their unique splicing reactions to form covalently closed loop structures [1\u20133]. They are abundantly found in human cells and play important RNA regulatory roles, including acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interacting with RNA binding proteins (RBPs), as well as modulating the transcription of parental genes by interacting with RNA polymerase II [2,4,5]. The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis proposes that RNA transcripts, including circRNAs, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), contain miRNA response elements (MREs) which compete among themselves for miRNA binding to regulate the expression of each other [6,7]. circRNAs possess miRNA-sponging activity and counteract the miRNA\u2019s inhibitory activity on the target mRNA [6,7]. Recent studies showed that the expressions of circRNAs were perturbed in viral infections caused by both DNA (hepatitis B virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and simian vacuolating virus 40) and RNA [Ebola virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), influenza A viruses, and avian leukosis virus subgroup-J] viruses [8\u201315], and that these circRNAs might serve as potential antiviral targets [9,12,16].",

Despite a high mortality rate of >30%, the virus-host interaction and pathogenesis of this emerging infection remains incompletely understood [20]. Moreover, the host ceRNAs profile changes and the functions of circRNAs in MERS-CoV and other human-pathogenic coronavirus infections have not been reported. In this study, we used MERS-CoV as a model to investigate the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in CoV infection. We showed that MERS-CoV significantly perturbed a high number of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs which were involved in a wide range of biological processes. We also validated the effects of selected circRNAs in MERS-CoV replication and provided new insights into potential host-targeting antiviral strategies through the manipulation of circRNAs.",

CIRI2 [28] and find_circ (version 1.2) [29] were used for the prediction of putative circRNAs. Overlapping circRNAs in CIRI2 and find_circ were selected for further analysis. The Burrows\u2013Wheeler Alignment tool was used to identify miRNA [30]. Unique sequences containing 18\u201335 nucleotides were mapped to miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search to identify known and novel miRNAs. Due to the short lengths, the expression of circRNA and miRNA was normalized to transcripts per million (TPM), where TPM = (actual miRNA/circRNA counts of total clean read) \u00d7 106. To identify mRNA, after alignment with the human reference genome GRCh38 with HISAT2, clean reads were quantified based on the number of reads spanning the back-splicing junction, and their fragments per kb for a million reads (FPKM) were calculated using HTSeq 0.10.0.

As shown in Figure 2A, there was \u223c2-log increase and 4-log increase in viral load at 6 hpi (early phase) and 24 hpi (late phase). Next, to obtain a comprehensive landscape of the ceRNA network of the lung epithelial cells with either mock infection or MERS-CoV infection, we performed RNA sequencing on virus-infected Calu-3 cells (MOI = 4) to profile the expression patterns of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA. To increase the confidence level of circRNA prediction, both CIRI2 and find_circ were used [28,29]. A total of 54605 and 99037 putative circRNAs were predicted by CIRI2 and find_circ, respectively (Figure 2B). Among these putative circRNAs, 49337 were predicted by both CIRI2 and find_circ. These 49337 putative circRNAs had a significantly higher mean GC content than the miRNAs and mRNAs in our study (Figure 2C). Among the 49337 putative circRNAs, 40961 (83.0%) were derived from coding regions (Figure 2D). The majority (41690/49337, 84.5%) of the putative circRNAs containing a small number (1\u20135) of back splice reads (Figure 2E). A minority (1986/49337, 4.0%) of them had head-to-tail junction with reads \u2265 20. The overall circRNA expression profiles at these three time points were uniform and not significantly altered by MERS-CoV infection. Collectively, these basic characteristics of the putative circRNAs identified in our study were similar to those identified in other human and mammalian cells, including mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, and acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 [38\u201340].\n\n",

These 147 genes were shown to be involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes in Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, many of these genes were involved in viral infection. For example, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor kappa (PTPRK) is downregulated by Epstein\u2013Barr virus in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), leading to suppressed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signalling [41]. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted organization-1 (MAGI-1) is a PDZ protein that interacts with viral proteins containing the PDZ-ligand binding motif, such as influenza A virus NS1, human papillomavirus 16 E6, and human alphapapillomavirus E6 proteins [41\u201343]. Notably, the different putative circRNAs generated from the same host gene might demonstrate diversified expressions. For example, the expressions of the different putative circRNAs generated from DNA polymerase epsilon subunit 2 (POLE2) and Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 48 (USP48) varied by >2 folds at 24 hpi (Figure 2G). These diversifications in the expression of the individual circRNAs might be related to their different biogenesis mechanisms and biological functions.",

As shown in Figure 4A, the point of inflexion fell between 3 and 5 in the Elbow method which prompted us to cluster the DE circRNAs into 4 groups (Clu1, Clu2, Clu3, and Clu4). These DE circRNAs demonstrated different time-course expression patterns (Figure 4B). The number of DE circRNAs in each cluster was 1046, 239, 347, and 183, respectively, for Clu1 to Clu4. The mean expression intensities of the DE circRNAs in Clu1, Clu2, and Clu3 in mock-infected cells were similar to those in MERS-CoV-infected cells at 6 hpi (Figures 4B). In contrast, the mean expression intensity of the DE circRNAs in Clu4 in MERS-CoV-infected cells at 6 hpi was lower than that of mock-infected cells. The DE circRNAs in all 4 clusters in MERS-CoV-infected cells at 24 hpi were higher than those in mock-infected cells and MERS-CoV-infected cells at 6 hpi. Using KEGG pathway analysis, we showed that the predicted functions of the host genes of the DE circRNAs in the 4 clusters demonstrated inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations (Figure 4C). Similar to the KEGG analysis of the host gens of the total DE circRNAs (Figure 3D), ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis was the most perturbed pathway in both Clu3 and Clu4 (Figure 4C). This observation implicated that key DE circRNAs that were involved in the regulation of MERS-CoV infection might be enriched in these clusters.\n",

As circRNAs could either restrict or facilitate viral infection through gene expression regulation, simultaneous examination of DE circRNAs and DE mRNAs might help to decipher the putative functions of the DE circRNAs in MERS-CoV infection [12,13]. This module-based analysis allows examination of co-expressed components with different expression intensities. After constructing a signed network which included positively correlated DE circRNAs and DE mRNAs, we used average linkage hierarchical clustering coupled with the topological overlap dissimilarity measure for module categorization [46]. Our WGCNA signed network consisted of 4 distinct modules, each representing a characteristic co-expression pattern of DE circRNAs and DE mRNAs (Figure 5A). Among the 4 modules, the turquoise module comprised the largest number of DE circRNAs and their co-expressed mRNAs [1709/1815 (94.1%) of DE circRNAs and 7280/10254 (71.0%) of DE mRNAs]. The other 3 modules included 55 (3.0%) DE circRNAs and 1536 (15.0%) DE mRNAs (blue module), 51 (2.8%) DE circRNAs and 1319 (12.9%) DE mRNAs (brown module), and 0 (0.0%) DE circRNAs and 119 (1.2%) DE mRNAs (yellow module) (Figure 5A). GO enrichment analysis of the host genes of the DE circRNAs and their corresponding DE mRNAs assigned in each module revealed that a wide range of biological processes were perturbed during MERS-CoV infection (Figures 5B and 5C). For example, in the turquoise module which comprised the largest number of DE circRNAs and DE mRNAs, the most perturbed processes included DNA-dependent transcription (GO:0006351), regulation of transcription (GO:0006355), protein phosphorylation (GO:0006468) and dephosphorylation (GO:0006470), and protein ubiquitination involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0042787) (P < 0.05).\n",

Explorations on the RBPs that could bind to these circRNAs through CircInteractome showed that both circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 contained multiple binding sites for Ago2 protein and supported our postulation that these circRNAs could act as miRNA sponges (Figure 7A) [32]. We designed divergent qRT-PCR primers and performed RNase R resistance experiments to examine the expression of these circRNAs with or without MERS-CoV infection (Supplementary Table 1). As shown in Figure 7B, no significant reduction in the relative expression of the two circRNAs was detected after RNase R treatment, while the expression of the mRNAs were greatly affected. To examine the biological relevance of these circRNAs during MERS-CoV infection, siRNAs targeting the back-splicing site of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 were synthesized and transfected into Calu-3 cells to assess whether depletion of these two candidate circRNAs could limit virus replication (Supplementary Table 1). Our results confirmed that our siRNAs could efficiently knock down the circRNA expression (Figure 7C) but not the linear form (Supplementary Figure 2), and most of the tested siRNAs significantly reduced MERS-CoV (but not SARS-CoV or influenza A/H1N1 viruses) replication in both cell lysate and culture supernatant (Figure 7D and Supplementary Figure 3). Importantly, the siRNAs did not affect cell viability (Supplementary Figure 4). Upon successful knock down (Supplementary Figure 5A), the viral load reduction by si-circFNDC3 and si-circCNOT1 were similarly observed in HFL cells (Supplementary Figure 5B). Moreover, over-expression of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 in Calu-3 cells enhanced virus replication (Supplementary Figure 6). To validate our hypothesis that circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 function by sequestering their target miRNAs to regulate mRNA expression, we evaluated the expression of their representative target mRNAs after knockdown with si-circFNDC3B-2 or si-circCNOT1-1 which were selected based on their higher inhibitory activity of MERS-CoV replication over si-circFNDC3B-1 or si-circCNOT1-2, respectively. As shown in Figure 7E, circFNDC3B depletion significantly reduced the expression of its representative target mRNAs, including MAP3K9, MYO15B, and SPOCK1. Similarly, circCNOT1 depletion reduced the expression of its target mRNAs, including MAP3K9, MEF2C, USP15, and ZBTB11. Taken together, these results supported our hypothesis that the circRNAs identified in our circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network significantly impacted MERS-CoV replication.",

First, a large number of circRNAs (49337) were predicted, including 16285 (33.0%) previously annotated circRNAs and 33052 (67.0%) novel putative circRNAs. Most of these circRNAs were derived from coding regions (83.0%). This is in line with the findings from PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells [13], and may represent a conserved character of coronavirus-infected cells. Second, most (84.5%) of these putative circRNAs had low expression levels as evidenced by their small number (1\u20135) of supported reads. This finding corroborated with those identified in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells, avian leukosis virus subgroup-J-infected chicken hepatic cells, and simian vacuolating virus 40-infected Vero cells [8,10,13]. Third, the mean GC content percentage of the circRNAs was significantly higher than those of the miRNAs and mRNAs. As the GC content is positively correlated with the stability of RNA transcripts, our finding corroborated with the consensus that circRNAs are usually highly stable [29,38]. Finally, our data showed that the number of different circRNAs generated from individual host genes was highly variable, suggesting a differential potential of gene regulation by diverse host genes through circRNA generation.",

Compared with the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells infected with influenza A/H3N2, our network in MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells demonstrated a higher number of DE circRNAs (7 vs 3), miRNAs (19 vs 1), and mRNAs (547 vs 9). This might imply that MERS-CoV infection induced a more profound and global change in the host ceRNA network compared to the less virulent influenza A/H3N2, although the differences in experimental set up should also be considered [14]. The DE circRNAs in our network were associated with a wide range of biological, cellular, and molecular processes. Interestingly, using both KEGG pathway and GO functional analyses, we showed that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis was significantly perturbed in MERS-CoV infection. The papain-like protease of MERS-CoV exhibits deubiquitinating activity and is involved in proteolysis of the viral polyprotein during virus replication [51,52]. Inhibitors of MERS-CoV papain-like protease such as 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine exhibit antiviral activity in vitro [18]. Modulation of the circRNAs associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis identified in our study may provide a new antiviral strategy for MERS-CoV infection.",

Our results showed that specific knockdown of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 significantly reduced MERS-CoV viral load in both Calu-3 and HFL cells, which was potentially associated with the downregulation of circFNDC3B- and circCNOT1-regulated target genes. For example, MAP3K9 is an upstream modulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways which influences many aspects of cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis [53]. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK signalling response is specifically modulated in MERS-CoV infection [54]. In this regard, we showed that siRNA knockdown of either circFND3B or circCNOT1 resulted in significantly reduced expression of MAP3K9 and provided novel insights to modulate the ERK/MAPK pathway as a host-targeting antiviral strategy for MERS-CoV infection.",
