            "text": "With the faster population migration and disease spread, more portable or even on-set point-of-care (POC) diagnostic techniques have been urgently called for effective infection control and in-time rescue. Recent advancements in molecular or medical biology are showing increasing possibilities for quickly and accurately diagnosing disease states using nucleic acid or protein biomarkers [[1], [2], [3]]. However, relevant methods are generally energy-consuming or requiring complicated instrumentation restricted within medical laboratories. To accelerate the development of portable, even off-shelf POC diagnosis device, pioneers have opened up a new detection strategy through translating the biomarkers generally to the few types of already commercial POC products. For example, the personal glucose meter (PGM) [4], dipstick [5], blood gas analyser [6], paper chip [[7], [8], [9]], Thermometer [10], and pregnancy test strips [11,12] were recently modified to identify non-original (glucose, H+, trioxypurine, temperature, hCG) targets via aptamer- or DNAzyme-mediated conformational changes or sequence-specific strand exchange. Among these innovations, the transduction of PGM has received especial attention due to its higher accuracy quantitation [4,[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. The method uses the invertase as a signal intermediate. Mostly, generation of invertase is designed to be target relative. Through the enzymatic reaction in which invertase oxidases sucrose to glucose, the existence of target could be quantitatively monitored with PGM. Following this principle, drugs, toxic metals, nucleic acids, and various proteins have been successfully detected [4,[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]].",

The lowest detection amount for various pathogen genes, such as Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Zaire Ebolavirus (Ebola), could be less than 100 molecular copies (6.6 \u00d7 10\u221218 M), and the false positives frequently induced by the non-specific LAMP reactions have been completely erased. Even through, being limited to a one-to-one transduction principle of OSD, the final signal-to-background ratio, and signal magnitude, may usually be unsatisfied. And because the PGM only have one signal probe, the inverses (glucose), the one-tube smart analysis (logical or multiplex analysis) that is highly demanded by the portable detection is still impossible. This is actually a general challenge for most detection using commercial POC products.",

In the past decade, we and others have contributed many efforts in developing and optimizing analysis-friendly nucleic acid circuits [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. Among these circuits the catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) [24,25] has now been proven a \u201cplug-to-use\u201d unit that could transduce various target species to a single-strand reporting oligonucleotide, with tens to hundreds fold signal amplification but almost \u201czero\u201d non-amplified background [25]. Here in the LAMP-CHA-PGM detection for pathogen genes, the introduction of CHA circuit successfully improved the signal amplitude by at least 12.5 folds, with almost 300 mg/dl increase in signal magnitude. Such a high signal-to-background deviation can efficiently reduce the misreading induced by signal errors or noises, and thus significantly increase the detection reliability. And more importantly, through importing an effective three-way junction based transduction between LAMP and CHA, we innovatively reported a one-tube smart analysis strategy in PGM based detection. Totally four situations for the existences of the genes of two foodborne bacteria, in Cronobacter sakazakii (ompA) and Escherichia coli (malB), could be directly readout using the final PGM signals (glucose concentrations). It is thus believed such a LAMP-CHA-PGM method has been already sensitive, specific, and highly deserving further efforts in the step-integration and final portable device fabrication. After replacing LAMP with another isothermal amplification, the nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), the CHA-PGM transduction was effectively enabled to detect RNA amplifications, which further confirmed the universality of the method.",

            "text": "The detailed pathway of gene detection is shown in Fig. 1\n, including three sub-steps allowed happening step by step or together. The first step (STEP I) is loop mediated isothermal amplification, the LAMP [32]. At a constant temperature (60\u00b15 \u00b0C), LAMP can amplify a segment of pathogen gene from as few as 10 copies for up to 108\u2013109 folds, until the products reach a detectable concentration. The reaction products include cauliflower-like structures with four types of single-stranded nucleic acid loops. In the second step (STEP II), one of the ssDNA loop sequence (here, F-loop) is sequence specifically designed as an associative trigger to activate a downstream CHA circuit detector via a strand displacement reaction across the three-way junction. In details, the F-loop is separated into two sequence domains, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Domain \u03b2 is designed to hybridize with a transducer probe (TP). Through this process domain \u03b1 will be close enough to the domain 2-3 in the TP, finally forming an associative trigger to start downstream CHA circuit (thus also called 3W-CHA). The 3W-CHA circuit pathway should be similar to any classic one [31]. The associative trigger opens H1 and then H2 through two successive OSD reactions, forming hybrid H1:H2 as the final product. And the trigger itself will be released into solution free to open another H1, as a catalyst. Third step (STEP III) is signal reporting step. During the H1:H2 hybrid formation, domain 2 previously embedded into the stem of H1 will be released into free linear stage together with domain 5-6. The domain 2-5-6 could start another downstream OSD reaction to displace an inverse-modified oligonucleotide (TmINV\u2013F) previously hybridized onto magnetic beads (TmINV\u2013F:Bio-Q-MBs). After simply magnet separation, the TmINV\u2013F will be left in supernatant and trigger the catalytic transduction of sucrose to glucose. The concentration of glucose could be directly read with a commercially personal PGM, as the indicator to the existence of targeting gene.",

LAMP is specially chosen because it contributes the main the ultra-sensitivity and an isothermal, constant temperature (60\u00b15 \u00b0C) reaction condition that is more easily to connect portable device [33]. 3W-CHA here provides the amplified signal magnitude as well as the ultra-selectivity to merely discriminate correct LAMP reaction, with up to 100-fold resolution to single mismatch [31,[33], [34], [35]]. The whole reaction components are high temperature-resistant. Until now CHA has been the only type of enzyme-free circuitry that is well engineered to execute at very large temperature window, through 4 \u00b0C to as high as 60 \u00b0C [34,35]. Also we have previously engineered a thermo-stable invertase that can keep efficient at even 95 \u00b0C [21]. The coupling with LAMP should thus be very flexible, either at end point or in real-time at 60\u00b15 \u00b0C. Therefore, through the LAMP-3W-CHA-PGM detection, sensitive, selective, flexible, and portable gene detection could be realized at the same time [21].",

            "text": "Before carrying out gene detection, the success of LAMP and 3W-CHA has been demonstrated separately. The ompA gene has been selected as our model target. Its five primer set for LAMP has been self-designed and proven very efficient in our previous publications [31]. They can amplify down to 20 copies of selected 236-mer gene segment within 1.5 h (Fig. S1). The F-loop of LAMP product contains 33 nucleotides. This 33-mer has been in-vitro synthesized as the mimic target T (CHA T1 or T1) of the CHA reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, the basic principle says that only the domain \u03b2 in TP, and domain \u03b1 in CHA H1 were relevant to the T1. Therefore, except domain \u03b2* of TP, and \u03b1* of H1, we directly borrow all other CHA component sequences from a well-performed CHA circuit previously designed for other purpose [31,35]. Classic fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have been firstly performed to test the efficiency of 3W-CHA reaction (scheme shown in Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 2\nA, the sample with T1 clearly shows higher and faster fluorescence emission compared with the one without T1. To demonstrate the amplification efficiency of 3W-CHA over OSD, domain 2-5-6 of H1 has been synthesized as the control target (OSD-T) for the OSD reaction on magnetic beads. It is observed when OSD-T and CHA T1 is used as respective input, under the same reaction buffer condition, 10 nM OSD-T shows much slower glucose production rate compared the one with 10 nM CHA T1 (Fig. 2C). While, the OSD background (0 nM OSD-T) is kept closed to that of CHA background (0 nM CHA T1, and 10 nM non-specific sequences). Fig. 2D provides the bar graph indicates the glucose concentration at the 60 min invertase-sucrose reaction. It clearly shows compared with OSD reaction CHA reaction produces 3.5 fold higher signal-to-background ratio as well as 12.5 fold higher signal magnitude.",

However, such a method is no longer applicable to the sensing strategy using commercial POC devices because each POC device only fits to a single analyte (signal probe). There is thus always a high technical barrier for the development of smart analysis in one tube. Here, we proposed a potential solution being assisted by the CHA circuit using three-way associative trigger. As demonstrated above, to detect any new target oligonucleotide, only the sequences of domain \u03b1* of CHA-H1, and domain \u03b2 of TP have to be changed according to the target sequence. The other sequences and all components with probe label can be remained unchanged. As shown in the pathway show in Fig. 4\n. When we aim to target two gene segments from two pathogens, for example, ompA and malB, respective LAMP reaction can generate the F-loop sequence for both ompA (T1-F-loop, shortened as T1) and malB (T2-F-loop, shortened as T2). According to the design shown in Fig. 1, TP-T1 and TP-T2 are respectively designed with \u03b2* coming from T1 and T2. Similarly, CHA H1-T1 and CHA H1-T2 were respectively designed with \u03b1* coming from T1 and T2. All other sequences, H2, TmINV\u2013F, and Bio-Q are shared, remaining the same as those used in Fig. 2. In this way, the multiple signal probes can be replaced by different concentrations of H1s for each different T.",

            "text": "Before coupling with LAMP reactions, we used the T1 and T2 as the mimic targets to demonstrate the ideal situation of the mechanism. For example, if the concentration of H1-T1 is 200 nM, while H1-T2 is 100 nM, these H1s together share 300 nM H2. Such a design allows T1 and T2 to release up to 200 nM and 100 nM H1\u2013H2 duplex, respectively; no matter how much each T was added. As shown in Fig. 5\nA and B, the target in each of 4 situations (no target, T1, T2, and T1 + T2) generates four clearly distinguished glucose generated curves. If we define the glucose concentration at 60 min produced by target T1+T2 and no target is respectively contributed by the 300 nM H1:H2 and 0 nM H1:H2, after the calculation the glucose concentration at 60 min of T1 and T2 well fit the values generated from 200 nM, and 100 nM H1:H2 (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the recognition of the target in each of 4 situations (no target, T1, T2, and T1 + T2) could be directly readout through the concentrations of H1:H2 generated. When T1 and T2 are replaced using respective LAMP reaction products, similar results are still achieved. But due to the amounts of LAMP products might vary for each reaction, sometimes the final loops may be not enough to finish downstream CHA reaction during the defined time zone. In other words, the actual glucose generation curve may more or less deviate from the ideal situation, as shown in Fig. 5D and E. Even through, to generally provide an accurate recognition during multiplex analysis, here we derive a simple calculation that helps to confirm the signal (glucose or H1:H2 duplex concentration) zone which a specific target may sit into, as shown in Fig. 5F. The detail for the calculation is provided in the supporting information. Through aligning the actual detection results to the signal zones, each of 4 situations (no target, ompA, malB, and ompA + malB) can still be discriminated (Fig. 5F), no matter whether the CHA reaction has been finished or not. Therefore, following this method, logical or multiplex analysis can be easily realized in one-tube, with the only one signal probe, glucose. It is notable that Fig. 5D\u2013F is gotten with LAMP amplicons generated from equal copy numbers of ompA and malB. But it actually doesn\u2019t matter once the copy ratio between ompA and malB is changed. It is because in most cases different template copies will generate very similar amounts of amplicons after 1.5 h LAMP reactions. Therefore, the method developed here may be generalized to most targets after isothermal amplifications.",

Through combining the advantage of each component, ultrasensitive, ultra specific and portable gene detection was realized. Being assisted by the design of three-way associative trigger, detection of a new target could be simply realized through chancing two sequence domains on TP probe and CHA H1. The sequences critical to signal out or required chemical label could remain unchanged. More importantly, through reading the different concentrations of H1:H2 generated for different target, we proposed a new multiplex detection strategy, which may potentially solve the traditional challenge encountered by most methods using commercial POC devices. Even though with these successes, many optimizations in experimental details are still required until a mature detection kit can be manufactured. And a device or chip that integrates all the three steps of this method is still anticipated to further simplify the detection.",
