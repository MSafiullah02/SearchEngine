For silencing of specific genes involved in cell cycle, small/short interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) are being used clinically. The siRNA-based RNAi is more efficient, specific and safe antisense technology than other RNAi approaches. The route of siRNA administration for siRNA therapy depends on the targeted site. However, certain hurdles like poor stability of siRNA, saturation, off-target effect, immunogenicity, anatomical barriers and non-targeted delivery restrict the successful siRNA therapy. Thus, advancement of an effective, secure, and long-term delivery system is prerequisite to the medical utilization of siRNA. Polycationic nanocarriers mediated targeted delivery system is an ideal system to remove these hurdles and to increase the blood retention time and rate of intracellular permeability. In this chapter, we will mainly discuss the different biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic (organic, inorganic and hybrid) nanocarriers that encapsulate and shield the siRNA from the different harsh environment and provides the increased systemic siRNA delivery.",

            "text": "In recent years, one of the most important transformations in the area of biology has occurred as RNA molecular biology. In 1990, RNA interference (RNAi) phenomenon was firstly discovered in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) in the form of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by Carolyn Napoli and Richard Jorgensen. Later, in 1998, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello found RNAi as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in mammalian cells; pursue the development of an innovative therapeutic tool in the biomedical field. Andrew Fire and Craig Mello demonstrated that dsRNA is more effective for down-regulation of gene expression than ssRNA (Xu and Wang 2015; Fire et al. 1998) . The interference mechanism of siRNA is involved to control many cellular phenomena including an intranuclear arrangement of heterochromatin and development, multiplication, differentiation and proliferation of cells (Berezikov 2011) . The core of mechanism is RNA molecules; microRNA (miRNA), siRNA, and germline-directed Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) which actually directs degradation of the protein-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) through a complex of certain enzymes. While piRNA and microRNA intrinsically generate from the genome, the siRNA perform as an exogenously designed fragment for interference therapy (Wilson and Doudna 2013) Thus, post-transcriptional gene silencing regulates the outcome of the targeted gene by repressing translation.",

            "text": "siRNA has several merits over conventional therapeutic agents like synthetic drugs or bioflavonoids. The key advantages are remarkable target-specific gene knockdown/silencing property, lesser side effects, potent gene regulation, thermodynamic stability, ease of synthesis with low production costs than protein or antibodies and there is no need of cellular expression system and complex protein purification (Liu et al. 2004; Chougule 2012) . One of the major advantages of RNAi is the capability to access \"non-druggable\" targets; for instance, certain targeted proteins which become inaccessible to drug due to alteration in enzymatic function or conformation. For such cases, synthetic RNA can be sequenced to target almost any desired gene of human genome (Aagaard and Rossi 2007) . This advancement is associated with the emergence of short noncoding RNA stretch known as siRNA. Because of its unique property to regulate the targeted genes expression (invivo and in-vitro both), currently siRNA has obtained more attention as a potent therapeutic agent in several biological and genetic abnormalities such as neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington's disease, hematological diseases, inherited genetic disorders, dominant genetic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, various cancers, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, ocular diseases and many other illnesses caused by action from one or several genes, which can be regulated via RNAi phenomenon (Gavrilov and Saltzman 2012; Dorn et al. 2004; Jagannath and Wood 2007) . The genetic expression may be altered at various genetic levels, involving RNA processing, RNA stability, chromatin structure, chromosome segregation transcription, and translation (Carthew and Sontheimer 2009) siRNA is a better therapeutic agent than conventionally used therapeutic agents. For the effective therapeutic therapy, the first and most essential step is to ensure the delivery of siRNA to the targeted/site-specific tissue and cells from the administrated site. Although, the systemic circulation of naked RNA molecule is challenged with several hurdles/problems such as fast enzymatic degradation in the physiological and biological media, entrapment by phagocytes, extravasation from blood to tumor tissues, recognition by the immune system, renal clearance, poor tissue penetration, incompetent endocytosis, immunostimulation, and off-target effects. These several drawbacks prevent the delivery of siRNA to the active site (Lee et al. 2016; Gewirtz 2007) . So, viral and non-viral carriers developed as carrier systems. Initially, the viral vectors were used as delivery platforms where the viruses deliver the therapeutic siRNA into the targeted cells through the mechanism of transduction. They are suitable for both transient and long-term gene silencing, depending on the type of carrier viruses. Moreover, viral vectors have the ability to enter the nucleus of the cells (Qiu et al. 2016a ). However, these conventional vectors have a risk of causing immunogenicity, toxicity, and insertional mutagenesis. The smaller size of viral particles with small size also limits the size of a therapeutic gene that can be inserted and carried. Some of the carriers and conjugated with various molecules are used to deliver siRNA such as aptamer oligonucleotide, sterol or antibody conjugates with siRNA. But these conjugations and carriers are not enough for the systemic delivery of siRNA.",

Non-viral based biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, nano-sized carrier systems extensively employ nanomaterials (NMs) as compact carriers for in-vivo delivery of siRNA. NCs have the diameter/size <100 nm. Due to small size, NCs have some advanced and unique physiochemical properties than micro or macro carriers such as they possess a greater ratio of surface area to volume with the increased number of surface-active molecules. These nanocarriers (NCs) form complexes with the siRNA or encapsulate it to develop an intact and inert molecule or particle which that is capable of transfecting the targeted cells and inducing the genetic interference (Dana et al. 2017) . Davis et al. (2010) showed the site-specific transport of siRNA using NCs in humans via systemic injection in earlier work, which developed as a foundation for later research related to the medical application of siRNA (Davis et al. 2010) . After this, several researchers and scientists have developed/synthesized several NCs such as cationic polymeric nanoparticles (polyplex), liposomal nanocarriers (lipoplex), carbon nanomaterials, lipid-based nanomicelles etc. These NCs protect the siRNA from rapid enzymatic degradation in biological and physiological media, reduce immunogenicity, increase blood retention time and cellular uptake, and increase the targeted delivery. These advantages are responsible for improving the therapeutic effects of siRNA during systemic circulation. This chapter presents the basic mechanism of siRNA interference, its advantages, various routes of administration, hurdles/challenges during systemic delivery naked siRNA, and overcoming of these hurdles using various nanocarriers.",

This process can be compared to another approach based on miRNA knockdown and replacement. For inhibition, a synthetic ssRNA known as antagomirs/anti-miRs employed as the antagonist of intrinsic miRNA through an antisense mechanism. The replacement process involves synthetic miRNAs which are introduced in-vivo to mimic the function of the endogenous miRNAs. This RNA mimicking leads to gene silencing and degradation/inhibition of mRNA consequently.

The siRNAs embedded within RISC are duplex, Ago-2 proteins detach and remove one of the strands from RISC bounded double-stranded siRNA referred to as the passenger strand. The other single strand, known as guide RNA, remains embedded in the RISC complex (Fig. 2) . The functionally active complex with guide RNA recognizes the target due to specific intermolecular base pair interaction (Tang 2005) . Ago-2 protein is composed of three functional subunits; namely PIWI, PAZ, and MID. Among these, the PIWI domain possesses the structural folding similar to RNase H and provides thermodynamic enthalpy to the RISC complex for (Gavrilov and Saltzman 2012) cleavage . The PAZ subunit of the Ago-2 protein binds two terminal 3\u2032-nucleotide specifically for connecting it to the RISC complex. The staggered ends of the siRNA consisting of the specific nucleotide lie in the core domain in a hydrophobic cavity composed of various aromatic residues where the base of the terminal nucleotide is stacked (Song et al. 2003) . The 5\u2032-phosphate group of siRNA is bounded to the carboxyl-end of the protein in the middle of the MID and PIWI domains through a magnesium ion (Ma et al. 2005) . It is observed that the Argonaute family also contributes while guide-strand selection. Argonaute conserves the strand which has less thermodynamically stable 5\u2032-terminal as the guide strand and cleaves another one to release the passenger strand (Schwarz et al. 2003) .Certain basic principles such as thermodynamic stability of the siRNA end regulate the selection of the strand which remains anchored to the RISC complex (Schwarz et al. 2003) . The strand with less stability at the terminals usually converts to form mRNA molecules which can be recognized and later on degraded by Ago-2. The strand complementary to the targeted mRNA act as guide RNA.",

Conventional treatment of psoriasis topically applies cortico-steroids, which leads to weight gain, itching dryness, stinging, fluid retention, irritation, hypopigmentation, atrophy, hypertension, and other side effects. It is highly desirable to find drug molecules with fewer side effects. Therefore, targeting the genetic cause i.e. upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines is a more suitable way to treat psoriasis. The overproduction of cytokine can be regulated by suppressing tumor necrosis factor alpha protein. Animal studies show that silencing of gene encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha resulted in the improvement in the psoriatic lesion.",

The main problem is to conserve the activity of siRNA during circulation in the systemic blood vessels.

The evidence from these studies shows that most siRNA molecules are probably not as specific as it was presumed and that siRNA treatment can bring about off-target gene silencing. The off-target effect refers to the suppression of genetic region other than the causative gene target. Such a phenomenon may produce undesirable genetic alteration and cellular dysfunction. The most common reason of \"off-target\" silencing is the seed region of the siRNA sequence. This region is characterized by partial homology of 6-7 nucleotide long sequence particularly inside the 3\u2032 untranslated sequence (3\u2032UTR) which bound with a different mRNAs rather than the desired target mRNA (Birmingham et al. 2006 ). In the condition, a seed region siRNA acquiring complementarity with certain regulatory miRNAs may distort the gene expression (Mouldy 2006) . Moreover, failure of discrimination between the guide strand and the passenger strand by RISC may prompt the chances of complementary interaction between siRNA and non-targeted mRNA. The offtarget effect can also arise as an after effect of the immune activation. RNA if perceived by immunoreceptors sometimes, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger signalling biomolecules such as cytokines which may alter gene expression (Wilson and Doudna 2013) .",

However, sometimes, it evokes undesired immune sensitization, which may lead to adverse effects (Marques and Williams 2005) . The siRNA might be discriminated as a foreign particle through various defence mechanisms and components of the immune system. For example, siRNA may be recognized by cytoplasmic and endosomal Toll-like receptors expressed on the surface of different immunocompetent cells. Consequently, the release of cytokines and type-I interferon generates inflammatory reactions. The immune stimulation property of siRNA is directly related to its size. siRNA oligonucleotide up to 30 base pairs usually doesn't confer cytotoxicity. A cell could safely be transfected with 30-nucleotide bp longer dsDNA without any cellular toxicity. On contrary, longer RNA strands elicit an immune response as it bounds to either TLRs or to certain enzymes such as 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L or protein kinase to trigger interferon. There are specific GU-rich motifs which are actually determined by TLR7, refer as \"danger motif\". For example, in the endosome vesicle of plasmacytoid dendritic cells 5\u2032-GUCCUUCAA-3\u2032 sequence is recognized by the TLR7 and stimulates innate mechanisms to release inflammatory cytokines further. Another example is of TLR9 activity is countering CpG motifs in antisense oligonucleotides. Thus the immune actions can be controlled by mode of delivery and passage across various intracellular compartments of the siRNA. RNA oligonucleotides larger than 27-29 base pairs and highly potent Dicer substrates siRNAs need to be safely administered and monitored for immunogenic side-effects (Rose et al. 2005) .",

Some of them are- Even though the above-mentioned methods have several advantages and provide a good platform to improve delivery of naked siRNA. However, the frequent application of these methods is limited because they are also having numerous drawbacks such as safety issues (insertion mutagenesis and immunogenicity) low loading efficiency and only laboratory/small-scale production. Furthermore, siRNA is more liable to nuclease degradation than circular plasmids. Therefore, we need a stable delivery system to improve the systemic delivery of siRNA. Now a day, an alternative approach, synthesis of nonviral vectors (synthetic carriers) is inflowing to resolve or reduce these drawbacks and to enhance in-vivo siRNA delivery. Nonviral vectors have various sizes, shapes, dimensions, and consist of different biocompatible and biodegradable materials. These carriers can load or entrap the high amount of siRNA and shielding from various hurdles or barriers such as rapid elimination, enzymatic degradation, reduced potency in-vitro and invivo both etc. Currently, different dimensions, shapes, nanosized (at least one dimension <100 nm) nonviral vectors are applied for the systemic delivery of genes, drugs, or co-delivery of both genes and drugs together. These nanosized, nonviral vectors enhance pharmacokinetics (increase half-life) with EPR (enhanced perme-ability and retention) effect, decrease rapid renal filtration/clearance, and protect from extracellular enzymatic degradation and support in escape from endosomes intracellular. These NCs have some beneficial properties like high biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity etc. Polymer, lipid-based nanomicelles liposomes, and dendrimers are mostly used nonviral NCs.",

The kidney is made up of numerous glomeruli, and the main function of glomeruli is the natural filtration barrier of undesired by-products in the blood. The size of pore the glomeruli membrane is approximately 8 nm (Wartiovaara et al. 2004) . Any molecules that have a molecular weight and a size below 50 kDa and 8 nm, respectively are typically rapidly expelled from the kidney (Rappaport et al. 1995) . After systemic delivery, siRNA is rapidly expelled out from the body system through either renal clearance and filtration through the renal system or the entrapment in the RES in the liver, spleen, lungs and bone marrow. For increasing the retention time of siRNA in the body, siRNA is entrapped indifferent NCs that have the size range between 20 and 100 nm in diameter. This optimal size range helps to avoid potency for avoiding both renal clearance and RES entrapment and allows NCs to remain in the circulation for a longer period and to increase the rate of intracellular penetration in tumor cells and tissues via passive targeting (Jang et al. 2003; Pecot et al. 2011 ).",

As the plasma membrane is made up of lipid bilayers, it is lipophilic in nature and having anionic charge. Therefore, the intracellular penetration of siRNA across the plasma membrane is quite limited by passive transportation due to the electrostatic repulsion. When the siRNA is administrated in the bloodstream, it is immediately covered by a major component of blood plasma protein i.e. serum albumin and initiates our immune system to engulf albumin coated siRNA by phagocytes NCs entraps or covered the siRNA, avoid the engulfment by the phagocytes cells and increase the cell penetration of siRNA. Polycationic (positively charged) NCs are the best suited for high siRNA loading, shielding from degradation during bloodstream circulation, and systemic delivery of siRNA, especially to metastatic tumors. The most commonly used polymers are polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Illum and Davis 1984; Norman et al. 1993 ). According to Bonnet et al. (2008) linear PEI-siRNA (lPEI/siRNA) conjugate showed better cytocompatibility and non-immunogenic than branched PEI-siRNA (bPEI/siRNA) conjugate (Bonnet et al. 2008 ). However, the NCs that are prepared from a single PEI polymer is not stable during systemic delivery of siRNA and agglomerate in the bloodstream due to slat medium and serum protein. The prominent solution to overcome the problem is to use a copolymer/mixed polymer (di or triblock copolymers) which are more stable, for example, PEI can be mixed with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) to prepare a PEGylated PEI/siRNA. PEG polymer covers at the outside of the PEI/siRNA conjugate by forming a hydrophilic layer that sufficiently reduces the agglomeration tendency of NCs with increased EPR effect (Malek et al. 2008; Merkel et al. 2009 ). Kim et al. (2012) prepared mannosylated and pegylated polyethyleneimine/siRNA (PEI-PEG-MAN/siRNA) polyplex NCs with an approximate size of 357.33 nm for increased cellular uptake of siRNA. In this conjugate, PEI entrapped a high amount of negatively charged siRNA, PEG provided outer stable hydrophilic membrane, and mannose was used as a cell binding ligand for macrophages (Kim et al. 2012) .",

Basically, there are three different materials are used to develop pH-sensitive NCs: protonizable, acid-labile, and destabilizing compounds (Torchilin 2014; Sawant and Torchilin 2012) .",

The PSE produces from numerous slightly basic cojugates (between pH 5 and 6), promoting proton (H + ) absorption in cellular organelles with lower pH and an osmotic pressure generated around the organelle membrane. Due to the generation of osmotic pressure, acidic endosome burst and release the materials into the cytoplasm. The advantage of the PSE is that we could easily control this effect by partially altering the groups from carboxylic acid (-COOH) to tertiary (3\u00b0) amines.

A very less amount of siRNA is passed through from the semi-permeable plasma membrane. After the intracellular delivery, siRNA is less stable in the bloodstream and has a very less half-life (<5 min) due to rapid enzymatic degradation by endogenous serum nucleases (Tseng et al. 2009 ). The intracellular trafficking of siRNAs starts in early endosomal vesicles where siRNA fuse with sorting endosomes and finally transfer their contents to the late endosomes. A high amount of siRNA is entrapped by the late endosomes and lysosomes and very less amount of siRNA is reached into the cytoplasm to come into play regardless of the release mechanism. To avoid the rapid degradation and shielding from engulfing by the late endosomes and lysosomes, various NCs have been developed to shield the naked siRNA such as cationic lipid, (Lu et al. 2009 ) polymers and di or triblock copolymers NCs, (Qian and Berkland 2015) nanomicelles (Zhou et al. 2016 ) etc.",

The most commonly used ONCs are nanomicelles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and carbon nanomaterials (graphene oxide sheets, nanotubes, spherical shape fullerene). These NCs have some additional benefits. The synthesis procedures for ONCs are quite easy and they can encapsulate more drugs or nucleic acids molecules with a controlled delivery.

These advantages make ONCs the most appealing systems for drugs and genes delivery and other biomedical applications.",

CS is a linear, natural, cationic, FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved polysaccharide (a long chain of monosaccharide carbohydrate) co-block polymer of glucosamine and N-acetylated glucosamine. Polymer and has been used for both in-vitro and in-vivo systemic delivery of siRNA because it has nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability properties (Malhotra et al. 2013; Vauthier et al. 2013) . Currently, CS is the highly used polysaccharide polymer for delivering of therapeutic agents (drugs and genetic agents) due to its high permeability capability across the semipermeable cell membrane (des Rieux et al. 2006) . In one of the study, prepared an novel amino acid-functionalized Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-chitosan nanoparticle (RGD-CHNP) that significantly increased selective intratumoral delivery of siRNA for regulation of many growthpromoting genes (PLXDC1, FAK, and POSTN) accompanied by therapeutic efficacy in the A2780, HeyA8, and SKOV3ip1 orthotopic animal studies of ovarian cancer models (Han et al. 2010) . Besides natural polymers, several biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic synthetic PNCs have also been used for systemic delivery of siRNA such as PLL (Cun et al. 2011) , PEI (Nimesh and Chandra 2009), PEG, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, polyfluorene, and cyclodextrin-based polycations. These polymers are linear and branched and similarly the efficient way to shield and efficient delivery of siRNA. Both types of PNCs can encapsulate a high amount of siRNA and deliver it via the passive route. For increasing the delivery concentration of siRNA on specific infected cells/tissues by escaping the normal cells and tissues, different actively targeted molecules are attached to the surfaces of PNCs (Table 1) .

For example, a study conducted by Varkouhi et al. (2011) , carbon nanotubes functionalized with PEI and pyridinium were explored for siRNA delivery. Both functionalized cationic CNTs complexed anionic siRNA and provide the silencing efficiency of 10-30% and 10-60% of cytotoxicity (Varkouhi et al. 2011) . Another study by Ren et al. (2017) was done to prepare and characterize a GO-based carrier, surface-functionalized with PLL and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser oligonucleotides to actively target tumors, These nanocarriers were then used for loading VEGF-siRNA and observed to perform a slow and sustained release of siRNA along with low toxicity as compared to bare GO . Figure 4d showed the two-dimensional, sheet-like GO structure that has numerous oxygen groups like carboxylic acids, hydroxyl, epoxy, and alkoxy on its edges and both side of surfaces. The average thickness of GO is about 1-2 nm and length/ width is between 50 and 200 nm depending on the biomedical application. GO has a high surface area and capability of holding molecules on both sides of sheets due to this GO has high loading capacity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are hollow one-dimension nanostructures. The CNTs may be cylindrical, tubular or needle in shape. Depending on the number of layers/ walls, CNTs are of three-types: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The typical thickness of SWCNTs is about 0.4-1 nm and that of DWCNTs is 1.4-20 nm (Schedin et al. 2007; Bae et al. 2010) . MWCNTs are 20-100 nm thick (Bartelmess et al. 2015) and 50-500 nm in length.",

Liposomes are highly biocompatible and biodegradable, small size, vesicles of amphiphilic lipid with the high surface areato-volume ratio. They have some superior physiochemical properties like increased rate of biological membrane permeability, the flexibility of functionalization, tuning of surface charge. These properties make liposomes a better nanoformulation to deliver drugs and genes than others NCs and also have been successfully applied in the clinic (Hatakeyama et al. 2011) . Polycationic liposomes as building blocks to entrap of negatively charged siRNA through electrostatic interactions and form lipid complexes systems called lipoplexes (Wolff and Rozema 2008) . So far, many liposomal formulations had got the FDA approval and many more are currently in development or in clinical trials enabling features such as stable circulation and tumor-specific targeting versions of siRNA-liposome carriers (Noble et al. 2009; Drummond et al. 2010; Patil and Jadhav 2014) . Liposomal NCs can be divided into four main types based on their physical structures-nucleic-acid-lipid particles, lipoplexes, lipopolyplexes, and membrane/core nanoparticles. Lipoplexes are composed of several bilayer of lipids in spherical form and siR-NAs are entrapped between the consecutive lipid bilayers. Stable nucleic-acid-lipid particles have the outer surface is almost neutral but inner surface are highly positively charged due to this inner positive charge siRNAs are entrapped in the interior of liposomes. Only pH-sensitive lipid can be synthesized by these types of liposomes. These liposomes showed cationic behaviour at acidic pH (pH-4.0) and noionic behaviour at neutral pH (pH-7.4). Lipopolyplexes are synthesized by coating the liposomes from oppositely charged polymers. If lipid NCs has cationic charged then they are coated with anionic charged polymers and vice versa. A membrane/ core NCs has some different structure than other liposomes NCs. This type of NCs is similar core-shell-like entities in which single or multiple inorganic NPs are embedded in the core and surrounded by a lipid bilayer form as the outer shell (Xia et al. 2016) . Landen et al. (2005) siRNA was encapsulated into 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC, a neutral lipid) lipid NCs and this NCs were decorated with EphA2 (oncoprotein, a targeting ligand) for improved systemic siRNA delivery. These liposomal NCs was tested on two different orthotopic mouse model ovarian malignant cell types HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1. EphA2-siRNA-DOPC NCs have significantly reduced the tumor growth compared to non-silencing siRNA. Whenever paclitaxel was also loaded on this NCs conjugate the cancer cell growth was drastically decreased on comparison to individual chemotherapy with paclitaxel and RNAi therapy with a non-silencing siRNA (Landen et al. 2005) .",

Numerous functional groups (-COOH or -OH) are suitable for the attachment of various ligands that makes it more suitable for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Dendrimers are made up of repeated branching unit and form a shell of either same groups and different groups, this shell is known as generation \"G\" (Kulhari et al. 2015) . When are mixed with dendrimers known as dendriplexes. Presently, dendrimers are used for the delivery of several hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, genes, bioimaging agents (Table 4 ). Depending on the type of central atom, different classes of dendrimers are available such as PAMAM (Polyamidoamine), PPI (Poly (propylene imine), PLL, and poly(2,2bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, etc. (Svenson and Tomalia 2012) . Due to its branch structure, several voids/spaces are formed where drugs or nucleic acids are Recently, for treating cancer researchers developed a tumor microenvironmentsensitive polypeptides-amphiphilic dendrimer as a carrier of siRNA/Paclitaxel (TMSP-ADENS/siRNA/PTX) complex for robust co-delivery of therapeutic agents. In this complex, siRNA and paclitaxel were encapsulated within the hydrophilic centre and internal hydrophobic layer, respectively. The outer PEG layer increased the half-life of dendrimers. This complex illustrated the highest rate while regulation of VEGF mRNA in A375 xenograft mice. Furthermore, the tumour-inhibiting and angiogeny-inhibiting activity were also observed in another study on HT-1080 xenograft (Li et al. 2018) .",

Cap is a component that is also present in human bones. CaP particles have several demerits also they are obtained in micro-sized with polydispersed. Nano-sized monodispersed CaP NPs was obtained, when they were precipitated with PEG. CaP NPs are not shown any toxicity at a higher concentration than RNAi-induced concentrations and also shown better control over endogenous VEGF mRNA expression in cultured pancreatic cancer lines. Researchers synthesized lipid/calcium/phosphate core-shell nanoparticles (LCP NPs) by microemulsion technology for improving systemic delivery of anti-luciferase siRNA. In this type of NPs, calcium phosphate core is surrounded by cationic lipid shell and decorated by an anisamide ligand complementary for sigma receptor on B16F10 melanoma cell surface. After IV injection of siRNA, the luciferase luminescence signal in metastatic B16F10 tumor cells was significantly diminished in C57BL/6 mice (Yang et al. 2012) . Several others studies have also been done for systemic delivery of siRNA using CaP NPs inorganic nanoparticles (Qiu et al. 2016b; Pittella et al. 2011) .",

However, both classes of NPs has some limitations. Inorganic NPs such as MSNs may have more stability, mechanical, chemical and imaging properties but accumulates as nondegradable substances and confers toxicity. On the other side, organic NCs such as polymers, liposomes, and micelles are biocompatible as well as biodegradable with high encapsulation efficiency both on the surface and within the core, but less stable in-vivo. For removing the drawbacks of both type of NPs, the hybrid NCs are the best solution. These hybrid NCs are prepared with the fusion of both organic and inorganic NCs. Numerous biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are coated or grafted on the surfaces of both NCs. These polymers increase biocompatibility, loading tendency of genes with reduced toxicity (Tatiparti et al. 2017) . Meanwhile the inorganic constituents provide diagnostic or therapeutic properties. Therefore, the hybrid NCs have benefit to offers the theranostics application with high delivery efficiency (Sailor and Ji-Ho 2012; Young et al. 2016 ) ( Table 6 ).",

Currently, gene therapy acclaimed as a revolutionary option of new therapy. siRNA delivery is an alternative approach, that has been pursued actively because of their excellent safety, high Rabies virus glycoprotein efficacy and specificity, easy modification, and unlimited therapeutic targets. But the therapeutic efficacy of naked siRNA is reduced due to systemic instability, before reaching to the target site. To get rid of these hurdles, the most vital solution is to develop biocompatible, biodegradable, and site-specific nano-sized carriers. Every NC has its own benefits and limitations depending on its physicochemical composition, offering a flexible and wide variety of effective agents based on siRNA. Organic NCs such as polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles and micelles have excellent tendency to encapsulate the therapeutic molecules nevertheless they are unstable and easily degrade within the systemic circulation causing the premature release of therapeutic molecules before reaching the specific site. Mixed polymer micelles are quite stable compared to single polymer micelles. Inorganic naked metal and metal oxide NCs like Au NPs and MNPs are stable and can be easily functionalized. In spite of these advantages, several studies have proved that larger size and a higher concentration of these NCs are toxic. Moreover, naked NCs are also unstable in systemic delivery and rapidly agglomerated by blood plasma protein. Hence, these NCs require stabilizing materials. At last, the nanocarrier mediated delivery systems better solution to resolve issues related to the potent systemic delivery of siRNA. Some of the delivery systems also have proven their values and passed the initial clinical phases.",

(ii) By complexation with a molecule or carrier, for example, the cholesterol-siRNA complex. The cholesterol-siRNA complexes improve pharmacokinetics (increases half-life of siRNA) (Wolfrum et al. 2007). (iii) By encapsulating siRNA in a carrier such as viral vectors. Various natural viral vectors have already in use for systemic transport of siRNA to treat various carcinomas. Jung et al. used an adenoviral vector encoding siRNA significantly suppressed the outgrowth of the pituitary tumor by transforming gene overexpressed in both in-vivo and in-vitro hepatocellular carcinoma cells(Jung et al. 2006).Sabbioni et al.
