Compared with the cost of quarantine, the potential benefit assessed by CVM was much larger. It may suggest that it's worth investing more resources in the control of SARS.

A payment card valuation question is an improvement over the open-ended valuation question, but some arguments exist as to whether there are range and centering biases.15, 18, 19 Following the recommendation and praxis of some health economic studies,8, 9, 17, 20 the closed-ended question with dichotomous choice was used in this study. The advantage of the dichotomous choice question is that each respondent is asked a single valuation question that is relatively easy to answer. The major disadvantage is that the CVM researcher only learns the threshold of each respondent's WTP, and more sophisticated econometric methods are necessary to develop an average WTP amount.15\n",
