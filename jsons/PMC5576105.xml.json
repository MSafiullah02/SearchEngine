            "text": "Since the middle of the previous century, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the cornerstone in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The initial addition of folinic acid (leucovorin) and subsequent addition of oxaliplatin (OX) resulted in improved response rates, longer remissions and an increase in patient survival [1, 2]. Subsequently, the combination of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, i.e., the so-called FOLFOX regimen, became a well-established treatment for colorectal malignancy either as in monotherapy or as an adjuvant to surgery [1]. With the widespread use of this triple chemotherapeutic combination therapy, reports of increased toxicity (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting) compared with the 5-FU/leucovorin treatment emerged [3]. Additionally, interstitial lung disease has been reported. In the majority of cases, the noxious pulmonary effects occur rather late in the course of therapy [4\u20139], although there have been exceptions to this rule [10\u201314]. Although pulmonary toxicity in conjunction with FOLFOX therapy is uncommon (\u2264 1.5%) [15], it can be lethal despite the immediate discontinuation of the chemotherapeutic drugs and the initiation of immunotherapy (i.e., corticosteroids). Indirect arguments designating oxaliplatin as the causative pulmonary toxic agent can be found in more than one publication [4, 7, 12, 14, 16\u201319].",

CT examination of the lungs revealed extensive abnormalities in both lungs with diffuse ground glass abnormalities in both the upper (Fig. 1a) and lower lobes (Fig. 1b) and areas of consolidation at the level of the lower lobes (Fig. 1b). Antibiotics were empirically prescribed (moxifloxacin) from day one. Hypoxic respiratory insufficiency arose and necessitated intubation 1 week after admission. Immediately thereafter, she was referred to our university hospital. On admission to our intensive care unit (ICU), 70% oxygen (PEEP 8 cm H20) was needed to prevent frank hypoxemia. The serum white blood cell count amounted to 19 \u00d7 10 9/L (the normal value is up to 10 \u00d7 10 9/L). Predominantly, neutrophils (78.8%, 14.97 \u00d7 10 9/L) and to a lesser extent lymphocytes (16.3%, 3.10 \u00d7 10 9/L), were present. There was no peripheral eosinophilia.

However, no microorganisms (e.g., (myco)bacteria, moulds, fungi, or viruses (entero-, rhino-, parainfluenza, adeno-, herpes simplex, or cytomegalovirus)) were detected. PCR on the BAL fluid for herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis also proved negative. Additional histopathological examination of the lavage liquid did not reveal malignant cells. There was no family history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), and there were no coexisting medical conditions that favoured the development of ILD. Moreover, there had been no occupational exposure to pulmonary toxins and no prior use of potential ILD-causing drugs (e.g., bleomycin, busulphan, gemcitabine, mitomycin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, nitrofurantoin, amiodarone), with the exception of the FOLFOX chemotherapy.",

While awaiting further microscopic characterization, immune globulins (Sandoglobulin 0.4 g/kg) were administered intravenously during a five-day period in an attempt to reduce the pulmonary inflammation that led to fibrosis [22\u201324]. Approximately a fortnight later, a single dose of cyclophosphamide (10.5 mg/kg = 1000 mg, Endoxan, Baxter, Braine-l-Alleud Walloon Brabant, Lessines Hainaut, Belgium) was administered due to the persistent need for ventilatory support and the possibility of an unspecified immunological process. The intravenous administration of acetylcysteine was continued. After these therapeutic interventions, the oxygen demand gradually fell. The definite histopathological findings validated the presence of on-going damage of the alveolar epithelium with evolving pulmonary fibrosis. Thickened alveolar septa with lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis and an exudate in the alveolar lumina lined with reactive cuboid pneumocytes were present.

Forty-five cases were identified [4\u201319, 25\u201339]. The data were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

In our patient, the respiratory symptoms arose after the 6th chemotherapy session, were rapidly progressive in nature, and were without microbial, autoimmune or environmental explanation. No infectious causes triggering the clinical picture were identified, although the high neutrophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was initially strongly suggestive of microbial disease. In retrospect, we found that this finding was also compatible with drug-induced lung disease [20]. In view of the fact that an autoimmune disease could not be diagnosed, the administration of FOLFOX was considered to be the probable and most plausible cause of the biopsy-proven interstitial pneumonitis. Similar histological findings have been reported in three other cases of FOLFOX-related ILD [10, 32, 39].",

            "text": "To which of the three components of the FOLFOX regimen should the development of ILD be attributed? Thus far, there have been no reports linking folinic acid (leucovorin) in monotherapy to pulmonary toxicity. Five-fluorouracil is a thymidilate synthase inhibitor whose antimetabolite properties are enhanced by folates. It is one of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agents and is applied in mono- and combined therapy for various solid malignancies of the head, neck, breast, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, prostate and bladder. Known side effects include alopecia, stomatitis, emesis, coronary spasms, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea and myelosuppression [48, 49]. There has only been one (Japanese) report of pulmonary toxicity accompanying the administration of 5-FU as monotherapy [50]. Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum derivative (diaminocyclohexane, containing platinum) that blocks DNA replication and transcription through the induction of intrastrand or interstrand lesions and DNA protein cross links [51]. Oxaliplatin is active against breast, gastric and colon cancers, renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma and cisplatin-resistant cell lines and tumour models including lung, ovarian, cervix, colon and leukaemia cell lines [51]. Known side effects include alopecia, peripheral sensory neuropathy (limb dysesthesia or paresthesia), haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), electrolyte disturbances (hyponatraemia, kalaemia), hepatocellular injury, nausea and vomiting, ototoxicity and laryngeal dysesthesia [6, 52, 53]. An important indirect argument pointing in the direction of oxaliplatin as \u201cthe\u201d pulmonary toxicity-inducing culprit lies in the observation that respiratory symptoms present during FOLFOX therapy do not recur after rechallenge with a 5-FU- and leucovorin-containing but oxaliplatin-deprived chemotherapy cocktail [4, 7, 12, 14, 16\u201319].",

Although sufficient for some, not all patients will experience improvement or full recovery after the cessation of the culprit compound. In our patient, the FOLFOX administration had already been discontinued, and acetylcysteine (supplying glutathione) was administered from day one in our hospital. Given that arguments linking oxaliplatin administration to glutathione depletion exist [30, 32], it seemed logical to continue glutathione supplementation because this molecule plays an important role in protecting the lungs against oxidative damage, which is a possible and probable contributing factor to the emergence of interstitial pneumonitis and subsequent evolution to pulmonary fibrosis.",

Because no favourable respiratory evolution over a 14-day steroid course was observed, and no autoimmune disease had been diagnosed in the meantime, intravenous immune globulins (IVIgs) were given in an attempt to reduce the deposition of excessive amounts of extracellular proteins (particularly collagen-I) in the lung and thus prohibit the progression of the lung fibrosis already observed in the patient\u2019s lung biopsy. These IVIgs were administered over a five-day period. The rationale for this treatment was found in experimental data that indicated that IVIgs are capable of preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice through the reduced expression of collagen-I protein in the affected lungs [23, 24]. Postulated mechanisms of this anti-fibrotic action of IVIg include modulation of cytokine production, inhibition of the complement reaction and inhibition of the CD95 receptor (Fas) activity through the presence of anti-Fas antibodies in IVIg [23, 54, 55]. Subsequently, one dose of cyclophosphamide, a nitrogen mustard alkylating and lymphocyte-modulating agent, was administered. This immunosuppressive steroid-sparing agent is used to treat autoimmune inflammatory disorders and associated interstitial lung disease and is frequently added to corticosteroid therapy to enhance the clinical response due to the additional suppression of immunoreactions that cause lung damage [56]. In our patient, an intravenous pulse was administered because at that moment, an unspecified immunological process (possibly with vasculitis) leading to pulmonary fibrosis seemed possible.",

Moreover, in some patients, ILD regression was observed without special treatment but \u201cmerely\u201d after discontinuation of FOLFOX. The fact that our patient exhibited no improvement after the withdrawal of the causative agent and developed a full clinical and radiographic recovery after the introduction of acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide, led us to believe that a causal relationship between this multimodal therapy and respiratory progress exists.",

Could there be interindividual differences in oxaliplatin metabolism that lead to toxicity? Indeed, the biotransformation of oxaliplatin leads to the formation of aquated platinum forms in the blood. Three compounds can be found: total platinum, free (ultrafiltrable) platinum, and erythrocyte platinum [57]. Platinum is rapidly cleared from the plasma by renal elimination. However, what if the erythrocyte platinum is not as harmless as generally accepted but rather exhibits toxic effects in isolated cases, and what if the clearance of erythrocyte platinum is delayed in a minority of patients?",
