These materials directed individuals to a website which provided information on how genes impact health, the conditions and genes on the panel, and the screening process. The website also included a decision aid and information on study features and goals for the purposes of informed consent. Participants consented to screening through the website. A total of 262 individuals consented to screening and provided samples for analysis. As per the requirements of the study\u2019s funding source, participants were also asked on the website if they agreed to have their results submitted to the National Institutes of Health database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) at the conclusion of the study. All but four participants from the Internal Medicine clinic agreed. Participants from the Biobank had previously consented to this.

The open codes were based on the interview guide and included ways that people responded to receiving a positive result, how they perceived it would affect them or their family, and decisions related to receiving the result, such as pursuing follow-up care. They then moved to the axial coding phase, which involves the interpretation of the data collected from the open codes [20], and met to discuss the open codes and emerging themes.

Those in their 60s and 70s noted that they would have worried more about the results if they were younger. For instance, when a participant with a positive result indicating a possible increased risk of long QT syndrome was asked if the result had changed anything in her routine, she replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m 74 so, you know, it\u2019s not like I was 20 and found out about this and worried about would I be able to live long enough to have children or not\u201d (Participant 10). Older participants also reasoned that symptoms would have already appeared if they were going to develop. For example, someone with a positive result indicating increased risk of hemochromatosis said he was not worried about his result since he is \u201calready 63 and [has] never experienced a problem with it\u201d (Participant 8).

Two participants received HFE hemochromatosis results for a second time. One, a 76 year old, said she was relieved she did not screen positive for genes related to cancer (Participant 4). The other, a 77 year old, said he tends to forget about his risk of hemochromatosis, so the result made him \u2018more aware of it again\u2019 (Participant 3). He planned to talk to his primary care physician about follow-up care, but when asked if the result would change any future plans, he commented, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to be 78 and, at this age, there are so many other things that could go wrong.\u201d This again highlights the role of older age in interpretation of the significance of results, especially for conditions in which the penetrance or risk of developing clinical disease is very low.",

In the second interview, she said that knowing about the positive genomic result was not terribly helpful and that her doctor did not even mention long QT at her recent appointment, reinforcing her belief that the positive result was not particularly important. The 63 year old with increased risk of hemochromatosis (Participant 8) said at the first interview that he had an iron panel done and will continue to have one every few years, per physician recommendation. In his second interview, he said he will keep up with the iron tests but that the results did not weigh on his mind because he had other health concerns, including Type II diabetes and a history of cancer.

Given that the average age for all participants was 60, it is not surprising that those who received positive results were also older. Their assessments generally reflect a relatively low level of concern. This aligns with prior research that learning positive genetic results does not lead to significant psychological harm [21\u201323]. Additionally, revelations of genetic risk later in life are less worrisome, in part because much time has passed without any development of symptoms. The two participants with increased risk of long QT syndrome acknowledged that learning about this at a younger age could have yielded beneficial early interventions. At the same time, our older participants\u2019 absence of any long QT arrhythmia symptoms, despite having a positive result, is exemplary of the concern that population genomic screening could lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary monitoring or interventions [24,25].",

            "text": "The study also revealed the difficulty of assessing harms and benefits of genetic screening for a diverse panel of 11 medically actionable conditions. For instance, the implications of receiving a long QT positive risk result are different at age 70 than at age 20, and are different than receiving a hemochromatosis risk result at any age. Diverse conditions on a panel (or, moreover, in genome sequencing) can also temper participants\u2019 interpretation of and reaction to their results, as evidenced by a participant who noted his positive hemochromatosis risk result was relatively \u2018good\u2019 in comparison to other results he could have received. In addition, participants\u2019 current and past health status mattered. Some recipients of positive results were dealing with health conditions they deemed of great urgency or import. Other participants already knew about their positive results, making the other negative results from the panel potentially more meaningful than the positive results. These findings remind us that context matters in how people respond to receiving screening results, and that in population screening programs, the information people already know when they undergo the screening cannot be controlled.",

            "text": "Arguably, the biggest potential benefit of population genomic screening of the sort anticipated by GeneScreen is the prevention or early treatment of disease in those with positive results. Thus, adherence to recommended follow-up care is crucial. Most people we interviewed did pursue some or all of the care recommended to them by the time of their first interview, including iron tests for those with hemochromatosis risk results and EKGs for those with long QT risk. However, by the second interview, almost no one had done anything further. This may have been consistent with clinical recommendations within 8 weeks of result receipt; that is, initial test results may have indicated that no further testing was needed. However, it is also possible that the importance of the result and interest in follow-up care faded for both participants and providers, given the type of result received or the lack of symptoms. Results from prior research on the relationship between receipt of genetic test results and adherence to prevention behavior has been mixed. Some studies show an increase in adherence [22,26]. Others report that screening results have little impact on prevention behavior [27,28], including a study examining follow-up care-seeking behavior among asymptomatic individuals after receiving positive genetic results through direct to consumer testing [29]. Our study further reveals the complexity of predicting behavioral responses to genetic screening results over time when considering the age of those screened and the type of conditions included on the panel. We found initial interest or intent to act upon the result, but further research is needed on the potential disconnect between these temporal motivations and subsequent healthcare utilization within genomic screening contexts.",

            "text": "Another frequently cited benefit of genetic testing, in terms of both population health and cost\u2013effectiveness, is the identification of at-risk family members through cascade testing [30\u201332]. In fact, many people who joined GeneScreen, especially older participants, cited this benefit as a reason to join [9]. Our interviews with people who received positive results reveal a mixed picture regarding family testing. Telling family members and encouraging them to be tested was mentioned by many in the first interview, but by the second interview, less than half reported that family members had been tested. Other studies have found that while rates of informing relatives of results may be quite high [33], rates of cascade testing for eligible first-degree relatives are quite low [34,35]. What is unclear, however, is whether low rates of cascade testing can be attributed to educational difficulties (e.g., probands who had the benefit of speaking with a genetic counselor about their results may struggle with communicating genetic information to relatives); lack of resources to make testing for family members easily accessible; the nature of the specific finding (e.g., dominant hereditary cancer risk vs recessive hereditary hemochromatosis); or some other combination of factors. Although efforts to implement precision prevention through genetic testing gain momentum, it is important to identify best practices in reaching family members to make testing efforts effective for both cost and health outcomes.",

Furthermore, not all participants with positive results agreed to be interviewed, including the two participants who received familial hypercholesterolemia results. Additionally, because this is a research project, these findings cannot be directly equated with clinical population screening. For all these reasons, it is likely that more themes will be revealed in future research about positive genomic screening results, particularly in terms of how participants react to results for conditions not examined in the current study and how younger people interpret the utility of positive results. Given the limited racial and ethnic diversity of the sample, it is also important to continue to investigate these issues in diverse populations as reactions to results can vary by race and ethnicity [36]. Future research should also focus on how people who receive positive results feel about prior decisions to have their results submitted to genetic databases, like dbGaP, and whether a decision to have post-test counseling in person or by phone impacts patients\u2019 decisions or follow-up care.",
