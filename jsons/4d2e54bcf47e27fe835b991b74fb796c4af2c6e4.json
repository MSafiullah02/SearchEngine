It is often a mild disease and seldom results in paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. In 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) coined the word SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) for an outbreak of AP in Hong Kong due to a novel coronavirus. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus AP occurred in the Middle East. Confusing case definitions such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) were coined. This paper aims to present a case of MP with sars, ARDS, pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and review the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP. Methods: We presented a case of MP with sars, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and performed a literature review on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care. Results: In early 2013, an 11-year-old girl presented with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was treated with multiple antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with 'typical' pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but tracheal aspirate identified MP instead. The respiratory equations are computed with PaO2/FiO2 consistent with severe lung injury. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms 'mycoplasma ' and 'ICU' , 'mycoplasma' and 'mortality' , and 'mycoplasma' and 'severe' . Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in MP infection is associated with a cell-mediated immune reaction, and high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy has been reported especially for severe disease. Management of severe mycoplasma infection in the PICU includes general cardiopulmonary support and specific antimicrobial treatment. Macrolide resistance genotypes have been detected. Conclusion: We urge health organizations to refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions each and every time when outbreaks of AP occur.

The epidemiologic characteristics, including periodic epidemics, and some clinical characteristics of MP are similar to those observed in systemic viral infections (1). AP caused by MP has been called 'walking pneumonia' because it usually affects older children and seldom results in PICU admission (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Nevertheless, the pathogen can occasionally cause severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) (4, 7, 9, 11) . Rarely, mycoplasma can co-infect children and result in very severe and even fatal disease (12) . Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the US National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms 'mycoplasma' and 'ICU' , 'mycoplasma' and 'mortality' , and 'mycoplasma' and severe', with limits activated (ages: birth to 18 years), respectively, as of March 2013. These publications are used to address the clinical questions as to the epidemiology of MP, PICU admission and mortality. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported (3, 4, 8) . One study indicated that patients with MP-associated encephalitis are predominantly pediatric, and they frequently require intensive care with prolonged hospitalizations (5) . In a large Chinese study on etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia in children, mycoplasma was only reported in 0.4% (3, 4, 8) . Nevertheless, recent MP infections play a significant role in exacerbations of asthma and occurrence of status asthmaticus in children (4) . A retrospective review of all patients admitted to PICU over a 12-month period with status asthmaticus showed evidence of recent mycoplasma infection [by Immunocard Mycoplasma Enzyme Immunoassay for detection of MP immunoglobulin M antibodies (Meredian Diagnostics, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA)] in 42% (3, 4, 8) . There were no statistically significant differences in length of hospitalization, ICU days, duration of continuous albuterol aerosol, days on oxygen or white blood cell counts between the two groups. However, patients who were mycoplasma positive were treated with a macrolide antibiotic in addition to their standard asthma therapy. Patients with evidence of recent MP infection were more likely to have one or more infiltrates on their chest radiography. The authors reported no mortality reported in the series.

Some patients with MP infection are clinically resistant to antibiotics such as erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin or clindamycin. The relationship between the point mutation pattern of EM-resistant strains and their resistance phenotypes to several macrolide antibiotics was investigated in a Japanese study, which isolated MP from patients and found that one of three isolates showed a point mutation in the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (18, 19) . Furthermore, 141 EM-sensitive clinical isolates of MP were cultured in broth medium containing 100 microg/mL of EM. Among 11 EM-resistant strains that grew in the medium, point mutations in the 23S rRNA were found in three strains at A2063G, five strains at A2064G and three strains at A2064C. During an outbreak of MP infections in southern Italy in 2010, 48 clinical specimens from 43 pediatric patients hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections were analyzed for macrolide resistance (18, 19) . The mutations associated with resistance (A2063G and A2064G) and MP subtypes were detected by sequencing the targeted domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene and a region in the MPN528a gene, respectively. Macrolide resistance genotypes were detected in 11 (26%) of the 43 MP-positive children. The A2063G mutation was identified in seven patients, and the A2064G mutation was identified in the remaining four. Upon admission, the isolates from three patients showed a susceptible genotype but subsequently acquired the A2063G mutation. Genotyping revealed MP subtype 1 in 33 of 40 sequenced strains and subtype 2 in the remaining 7. There was no association between macrolide resistance or susceptibility and the MP subtypes. Locally, Lung et al. reported that macrolide-resistant MP accounted for 33% (3 out of 10 patients) of the PCR-confirmed cases (20) .
