This sign is often seen in two types of Aspergillus infection : angioinvasive and mycetoma . \u2022 Pathogenesis of air crescent sign in angioinvasive Aspergillus infection. It is caused by parenchymal cavitation, which typically occurs 2 weeks after the detection of the initial radiographic abnormality. The nodules are composed of infected hemorrhagic and infarcted lung tissue. As the neutrophil count recovers and the patient mounts an immune response, peripheral reabsorption of necrotic tissue causes the retraction of the infarcted center, and air fi lls the space in between. This creates an air crescent within the nodules and is a good prognostic fi nding because it marks the recovery phase of the infection. This sign is seen in approximately 50 % of patients. Angioinvasive Aspergillus infection is often fatal. \u2022 Pathogenesis of air crescent sign in mycetoma (aspergilloma) . It is caused by the presence of a fungus ball inside a cavity separated from the wall of the cavity by an airspace of variable size. Air crescent sign in mycetoma , also referred to as the Monad sign, was fi rst described in 1954 by Pesle and Monod. It is seen in an immunocompetent host with preexisting cystic or cavitary lung disease, usually from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The radiographic appearance is often that of a gravitydependent mass within a preexisting cavity.",

Four CT features were used to classify lesions as airspace metastases: (a) airspace nodules, (b) parenchymal consolidation containing air bronchogram and/or showing angiogram sign, (c) focal or extensive ground-glass opacities, and (d) nodule(s) with a \"halo\" sign.",

According to the glossary of the Fleischer society, reversed halo sign is defi ned as a focal rounded area of ground-glass opacity surrounded by a more or less complete ring of consolidation. This sign was at fi rst described in 1996 by Voloudaki et al. who reported this fi nding in two cases of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP -now defi ned OP). The defi nition of atoll sign was at fi rst coined by Zompatori et al. in 1999, in a case report of a patient with BOOP. Still in 1999, Marlow et al. used the term \"fairy ring\" to describe the atoll sign in a case of sarcoidosis. In organizing pneumonia (OP, Figure B above), the central ground-glass opacity corresponded histopathologically to the area of alveolar septal infl ammation and cellular debris ( ) and the ring-shaped or crescentic peripheral airspace consolidation, to the area of organizing pneumonia (\u25ba). Reversed halo sign was initially considered highly specifi c for OP, where it is present in about 20 % of the cases. Later, the presence of this sign has been described in several different diseases (please see table above).",
