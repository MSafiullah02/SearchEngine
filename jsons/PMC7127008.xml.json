Ca2+ ions are directly involved in ligand binding, as well as in maintaining the structural integrity of the CRD that is necessary for the lectin activity [1]. Depending on the amino acid sequence, the CRD has specificity for mannose, galactose or fucose structures. Moreover, interaction of these carbohydrate structures with the different CLRs is dependent on carbohydrate branching, spacing and multivalency.",

Thus, CLRs recognize carbohydrate patterns expressed by the invading microorganisms and have a role in both innate and adaptive immunity [4]. Several microorganisms have developed strategies for exploiting the CLR-mediated uptake to their benefit, and evade the host immune defenses [5, 6].",

The observation that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in their carbohydrate-binding profiles was also reported by van Liempt et al. [10\u2022]. By examining the binding of various mutants of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to Schistosoma mansoni egg antigen, they showed that the difference in one single amino acid at the binding site is responsible for the fucose specificity of DC-SIGN [10\u2022]. More specifically, they indicate that although L-SIGN seems unable to bind to Lewis-X, it still interacts with other fucosylated glycans such as Lewis A, -B and \u2013Y [10\u2022].",

High-resolution electron microscopy images demonstrated a direct relationship between DC-SIGN function as a viral receptor and its microlocalization on the plasma membrane. During development of human monocyte-derived DCs, DC-SIGN organization changes from a random distribution pattern into well-defined microdomains on the cell membrane. These submicron-sized microdomains have an average diameter of 100\u2013200 nm, as established by electron microscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy [20]. The organization of DC-SIGN in microdomains on the plasma membrane is important for the binding and internalization of virus particles, suggesting that these multimolecular assemblies of DC-SIGN act as a docking site for pathogens such as HIV-1 to invade the host [19\u2022\u2022].",

More specifically, the use of small RNAi-expressing lentiviral vectors specifically to knock down DC-SIGN on DCs showed that DC-SIGN\u2212 DCs are still able to internalize HIV-1, although the binding of virions was found to be reduced, but they cannot transfer HIV-1 infection to target cells [22\u2022, 23]. It is becoming clear that other viruses besides HIV-1 target DC-SIGN to promote their dissemination and modulate DC function for establishing chronic infections. Hepatitis C virus has recently been shown to target DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to escape lysosomal degradation [24]. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus binds to DC-SIGN and is transferred by DCs to susceptible target cells through a synapse-like structure [25].",

Firstly, the pathogen itself expresses at its surface a specific PAMP, or a combination of different PAMPs, which dictates the recognition by specific receptors. Secondly, the set of PRRs expressed varies among different cells, resulting in a specific set of pathogen-recognition receptors which is different for each cell type of the immune system. Thirdly, changes in PRR cell-surface distribution adds yet another level of complexity, modulating the binding to certain carbohydrate moieties, and thus regulating the affinity for different ligands. Finally, these receptors have been shown to interact with each other, thereby giving rise to a network of multimolecular complexes that add a fourth level of complexity to pathogen recognition. Unraveling the precise mechanisms regulating the formation and exact function of these receptor networks is the present challenge.",

Differences in PAMPS expressed by pathogens and PRRs on host cells determine a first and second level of complexity in recognition. (a) Changes in receptor distribution at the cell surface might further influence the binding to a pathogen and the subsequent intracellular routing of the pathogen, and determine pathogen survival or lysosomal degradation. (b) The formation of mixed multimolecular receptor assemblies (for example, between CLRs and TLRs, complement receptors or other CLRs) might further extend the PAMP profile. Moreover, the outcome of a cell response to a pathogen (for example, in terms of the release of different cytokines) might differ depending on the triggering of single receptors or receptor complexes.",
