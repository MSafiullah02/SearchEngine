He went to the Accident and Emergency Department of our hospital on March 27, 2003 with fever and shortness of breath, and eventually SARS was confirmed. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the ICU on April 12 for mechanical ventilation. He was given ribavirin, kaletra (coformulation of lopinavir and ritonivir, both inhibitors of HIV protease), ritonivir, antibiotics, pulse methyprednisolone and immunoglobulin. His condition was further complicated by bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces. His tracheal tube frequently became blocked with secretions. Thus, surgical tracheostomy was performed on May 7 when he was clinically more stable. Immediately before surgery he was on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support mode. His arterial saturation was 92% when he was ventilated with oxygen 40%. Both chest drains were swinging but not bubbling. He was anaemic, with a haemoglobin concentration of 11 g dl\u22121 but his renal and liver function were normal. He was finally weaned off the ventilator 19 days after tracheostomy. He was transferred to a nearby district hospital for convalescence on June 5, a few days after being decannulated.",

All theatre personnel wore protective clothing consisting of a Tyvek\u00ae BarrierMan (DuPont Nonwovens, Peoples\u2019 Republic of China) and water-resistant disposable gown, cap, boots, double gloves, goggles, N95 mask, and AirMate\u2122 (3M Occupational Health and Environmental Safety Division, USA), with a Tyvek\u00ae head cover down to both shoulders. A practice run immediately before the operation was conducted to ensure smooth running of the whole procedure, including transfer to and from the operating theatre, surgery, and for decontamination and disinfection of the operating theatre. Particular attention was paid to the removal of staff's personal protective equipment to avoid self-contamination.",

Apart from essential monitors (ECG, arterial line and pulse oximetry), i.v. access, chest drains and other tubing and connections were reduced to a minimum to avoid the risk of disconnection and spillage of contaminated blood or other fluids. The patient was transported on an adjustable trolley with a portable ventilator to allow a safe distance between the patient and intensivist. After positioning with a shoulder support and head ring, the patient was operated on the trolley to reduce unnecessary disconnection of catheters and tubing during transfer to and from the operating table. Another surgeon, anaesthetist and team of theatre staff were on standby in the adjacent operating theatre to allow for rapid take over in case of problems.",

After preoxygenation with oxygen 100% for 3 min, apnoea was allowed to facilitate incision of the trachea and insertion of a tracheostomy tube. When the surgeon signalled that he was going to incise the trachea, the cuff of the tracheal tube was deflated and the tube was pulled back 3 cm. No tracheal or wound suctioning was attempted, to avoid aerosol generation of blood or secretions. A closed suction system and a viral filter of 99.97% efficiency were incorporated into the catheter mount to facilitate suctioning in a closed system. Another viral filter was connected to the breathing circuit for added safety. Once the tracheostomy tube was in place, as confirmed by the presence of carbon dioxide on end-tidal gas sampling and chest movement, the tracheal tube was removed under a large piece of clear plastic in which it was immediately wrapped and disposed of in a plastic bag designated for contaminated waste. After the operation, which took 15 min, the patient was reconnected to the portable monitor and ventilator. Once his condition was stable, the patient was transferred back to the ICU by a separate transport team. This allowed the operating team ample time to decontaminate and disinfect the operating theatre, and then remove and dispose of their personal protective equipment without contaminating themselves.",

More than 400 of the 1755 SARS patients in Hong Kong were healthcare workers.

            "text": "Tracheal intubation and tracheostomy are aerosol-generating procedures which may facilitate transmission of the aetiological agent for SARS. It is thus recommended that aerosol-inducing procedures should be performed on SARS patients only when deemed absolutely necessary. Procedures should be carried out using both contact (e.g. gloves, gown and eyewear) and airborne precautions (e.g. respiratory protective devices with filter efficiency of greater than or equal to 95%).3 One survey showed that the practice of droplet and contact precautions was adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposure to patients with SARS.4 However, in Toronto three anaesthetists using traditional respiratory and contact precautions contracted SARS after intubating patients with respiratory failure of unknown cause.5 In Hong Kong, three out of 160 ICU staff at one teaching hospital contracted SARS despite stringent measures being in place.6 We therefore decided that, in addition to contact and airborne precautions, staff should use the 3M AirMate power air purifying respirator.5 The AirMate and head cover are not easy to put on quickly and training is highly recommended. We also followed the recommendation of putting on a double gown for maximum protection.5 The outer gown is water resistant and is removed in the operating theatre. The outer pair of gloves is changed to a clean pair just before leaving the operating theatre. The AirMate, BarrierMan and boots are removed in an adjacent gown-down area. We prefer the BarrierMan, which is a full body overall with hood, instead of an inner gown because it covers the neck and both lower legs. The BarrierMan is difficult to take off but training lessens cross-contamination. An inspector with full knowledge of infection control is required to supervise removal of personal protective equipment. Immediately afterwards, the staff should go directly to the changing room for a shower.",

As communication and the observation abilities of staff are hindered by the noisy, unfamiliar and isolated operating theatre environment and the bulky personal protective equipment, problems should be anticipated and managed according to an agreed plan. Basic equipment such as a stethoscope cannot be used. Audio alarm volumes must be turned up to allow detection of problems. Back-ups should be immediately available for optimal staff support.",

Patients with SARS presenting for tracheostomy are in the pulmonary destruction phase of the illness. They often have a ground glass appearance on chest radiograph, poor arterial blood saturation, superimposed bacterial lung infection and a high risk of spontaneous pneumothoraces. The SARS process may affect the haematological system, resulting in anaemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Patients may also have liver dysfunction reflected by raised alanine aminotransferase and hypoalbuminaemia.1 Renal impairment may develop and patients may require renal replacement therapy. A clinical picture resembling disseminated intravascular coagulopathy may occur. All these problems may be further complicated by the drug therapy. Ribavirin can cause haemolytic anaemia, hypotension, brady/tachycardia, seizures, nephrolithiasis, elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia, and skin eruptions. Lopinavir has been associated with increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and cases of pancreatitis have been reported.",
