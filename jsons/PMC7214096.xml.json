Evidence from former studies of SARS and MERS indicates that human coronaviruses (CoV) do not remain confined to the respiratory system. Instead, they can disseminate damaging several other regions, including the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, many human coronaviruses are neurotropic and potentially neurovirulent. Possible mechanisms of entry into the CNS include the neuronal retrograde route and hematogenous dissemination. Within the neuronal route, trans-synaptic transfer via peripheral nerve terminals has been well documented for other coronaviruses. An alternative pathway for neuroinvasion implicates connections from mechano- and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways to specific nuclei in the brainstem.",

A group described four patients who developed axonal polyneuropathy, myopathy, or both approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS [2], while others have reported large artery ischemic strokes [3]. These findings raise the critical issue of possibly needing to adjust therapeutic strategies in certain patients. Similarly, patients with MERS-CoV infections have a high probability of experiencing neurological complications. A retrospective study of patients with MERS found that symptoms such as generalized fatigue, confusion, and myalgia are relatively common [4]. Another study reported that almost 1/5 of patients show specific neurological complications, including impaired consciousness, paralysis, ischemic stroke, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and other neuropathies which appeared 2\u20133 weeks after the respiratory symptoms [5].",

Notably, earlier this year, a group found that up to one-third of COVID-19 patients presented at least one neurological symptom [6]. Most reported symptoms are non-specific like dizziness, headache, fatigue, and myalgia. However, specific symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease, seizure, and coma are also described and are more common in severe cases of COVID-19. The incidence of neurological features may vary significantly among different study populations. Further studies are needed to assess whether the neurological complications are reflective of direct viral injury or due to the secondary or systemic effects of infection. These symptoms may be indicative of intercurrent viral neuroinvasion and based on preliminary evidence, some authors have hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 takes part in the development of respiratory failure [7]. Indeed, experimental studies in transgenic mouse models have provided important insight into the potentially critical role for CNS infection in SARS, suggesting that death may be secondary to neuronal dysfunction in cardiorespiratory centers of the medulla [8].",

SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is primarily expressed on epithelial cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and is utilized by the virus to enter host cells. However, ACE2 is also detected in the CNS, especially in the brainstem and regions responsible for regulating cardiovascular functions such as the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Interestingly, ACE2 is expressed in both neurons and astroglia [9] and the latter may also play a role in facilitating viral spread in the CNS by becoming activated. This hypothesis is corroborated by the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-1 in the cerebrum while the virus remained undetected in the cerebellum, where the ratio of neural to non-neural cell types is significantly different [10].",

This state of hyperinflammation may significantly damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which in turn can amplify the neuroinflammatory process. Neuroinflammatory activity associated with functional brain damage may partly explain the reports of clinical cognitive deficits reported in some patients during and after acute pneumonia. Indeed, altered consciousness, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes may be caused by systemic inflammation associated with prolonged hypoxia and neuroinflammatory damage to specific cortical areas [13].",

Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia [14], and other colleagues from China, France, and Northern Italy have the same experience [15]. The first record of direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS came from physicians in Beijing Ditan Hospital, China, who reported a case of encephalitis with confirmed presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid.

Acute ischemic stroke often occurs in the elderly, which is one of the most susceptible demographics of severe COVID-19.

Thus, the risks and benefits of intravenous thrombolysis and/or arterial embolectomy should be reconsidered in patients with comorbidities of acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is known to bind to the ACE2 receptor on vascular endothelial cells, resulting in abnormally increased blood pressure.
