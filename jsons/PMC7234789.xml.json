While COVID-19 has been termed a great equaliser, necessitating physical distancing measures across the globe, it is increasingly demonstrable that social inequalities in health are profoundly, and unevenly, impacting COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.",

Homeless families are at higher risk of viral transmission because of crowded living spaces and scarce access to COVID-19 screening and testing facilities.1 In a Boston study of 408 individuals residing in a shelter, 147 (36%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test.2 Smoke exposure and smoking has been linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19.3 A systematic review found that current or former smokers were more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms than non-smokers (relative risk [RR] 1\u00b74 [95% CI 0\u00b798\u20132\u00b700]) as well as an increased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or COVID-19-related mortality (RR 2\u00b74, 1\u00b743\u20134\u00b704).3 In the USA, the COVID-19 infection rate is three times higher in predominantly black counties than in predominantly white counties, and the mortality rate is six times higher.4 In Chicago alone, over 50% of COVID-19 cases and almost 70% of COVID-19 fatalities are disproportionately within the black population, who make up only 30% of the overall Chicago population.4\n",

School closures increase food insecurity for children living in poverty who participate in school lunch programmes. Malnutrition causes substantial risk to both the physical and mental health of these children, including lowering immune response, which has the potential to increase the risk of infectious disease transmission.5 People or families who are homeless are at higher risk of infection during physical lockdowns especially if public spaces are closed, resulting in physical crowding that is thought to increase viral transmission and reduce access to care.1 Being able to physically distance has been dubbed an issue of privilege that is simply not accessible in some communities.4\n",

Several adverse social determinants that impact the risk of COVID-19 morbidity also increase asthma morbidity, including poverty, smoke exposure, and race or ethnicity.6 Consistent associations have been noted between poverty, smoke exposure, and non-Hispanic black race and measures of asthma morbidity, including poorer asthma control and increased emergency department visits for asthma.6 The interplay of social determinants, asthma, and COVID-19 might help explain the risk of COVID-19 morbidity imposed by asthma, such as the disproportionate hospitalisations for COVID-19 among adults with asthma living in the USA.7 The CDC note asthma to be a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity.8 Data released from the CDC on hospitalisations in the USA in the month of March, 2020, notes that 12 (27%) of 44 patients aged 18\u201349 years who were hospitalised with COVID-19 had a history of asthma,8 in those aged 50\u201364 years, asthma was present in 7 (13%) of 53 cases, and in those 65 years or older asthma was present in 8 (13%) of 62 cases.8\n",

Studies are required to measure the effect of COVID-19 on individuals with adverse social determinants and innovative approaches to management are required, and might be different from those of the broader population. The effect of physical distancing measures, particularly among individuals with chronic conditions facing adverse social circumstances, needs to be studied because adverse determinants and physical distancing measures could compound issues, such as asthma medication access and broader access to care. The long-term effect of school closures, among those facing adverse social circumstances, is also in need of study.",
