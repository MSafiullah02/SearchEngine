In this study, the clinical picture induced by co-infections was not more severe than that observed in patients with only one viral infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and interactions of co-infectants. When a single sample contains many viruses it becomes difficult to evaluate the clinical significance of each virus. In these cases, quantitative analysis of each virus could be useful to provide information about the role of each species on the severity of disease. The analysis of oropharingeal swabs is methodologically difficult because the quality of the specimens is dependent on sampling technique and condition of the pharyngeal mucosa. Therefore, an exact quantitation may be difficult to obtain.",

In most of the papers, isolated cases or low incidence rates in adults were found. Often, this virus was detected in at high risk or immunocompromised patients (M\u00fcller et al., 2009, Ringshausen et al., 2009, Costa et al., 2009). Thus, our results are unexpected for what regards the circulation of the analyzed viruses in all of the age groups and the high hBoV infection rate in adult (18.9%) and elderly (26.4%) subjects. Currently, there are no data that endogenous reactivations or exogenous reinfections do occur for hBoV.

Sample collection was carried out by the Italian Network for surveillance of Influenza (InfluNet) organized by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the Inter-University Centre for Research on Influenza (CIRI) in collaboration with the Regional Health Authorities. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patient or from their parents. The main clinical features were acute respiratory problems with rapid and sudden onset with a temperature of > 38 \u00b0C accompanied by general symptoms (headache, feeling poorly, sweating, asthenia, shivers) and by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, pharyngodinia, nasal congestion) or fever accompanied by rhinitis, rhinopharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngeal tracheitis, tracheitis and acute bronchitis. The collected samples were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until processed. Respiratory specimens were tested for hMPV, hBoV and InfA-B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR).",

PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloning using the CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter) automated sequencer, with the same forward primers (M2f and B2f; see Table 1) used for the PCR. Phylogenetic affiliation of the obtained sequences was determined by using the BLAST search tool at the NCBI web site. Sequence similarity was searched by BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Multiple sequence alignment was conducted with ClustalW2 version 2.1 (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method and Kimura 2-Parameter model using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0 (www.xmegasoftware.net).
