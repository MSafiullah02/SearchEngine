The dental management of medically compromised patients can be sometimes problematic in terms of oral complications, dental therapy, and emergency care. One of the challenges faced by dental specialists today is the assessment and management of these patients. As mentioned in detail in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-60997-3_11 geriatric patients are much more likely to be at least partially dentulous having a complex medical history and the use of multiple medications.",

The body responds to stress by increased release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla into the cardiovascular system. This, in turn, can increase the workload on the heart (i.e., increased heart rate and strength of myocardial contraction and an increased myocardial oxygen requirement) in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease [13]. Therefore patients with cardiovascular disease are more vulnerable to physical or emotional stress that may be encountered during dental treatment than a normal patient [12]. Various steps should be taken to minimize stress encountered during dental treatment procedure. These are:Patients should be given reassurance to prevent or reduce anxiety.Medically compromised patients are better able to tolerate stress when rested. Therefore, appointments should be scheduled in the mornings [13].Angina-prone patients who experience greater than normal stress from the thought of dental work benefit from the administration of oral anxiolytics or nitrous oxide [12, 14].Patients should be seated comfortably (semi-supine) in the dental chair [14]Pain control is critical for lessening the chances of angina in ischemic heart disease patients by producing and maintaining profound local anesthesia in the surgical area via the use of longer-acting anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, or by using an anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor, after careful aspiration [14, 15].Intermittent rest should be provided to the patient thereby reducing fatigue.Appointments should not be long [13].\n",

Patients with cardiovascular disease have a high risk of complications due to endogenous catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) released from pain and stress. These catecholamines may increase dramatically BP and cardiac output. This effect is reduced by controlling dental pain. Local anesthetics with epinephrine produce a longer and more effective anesthesia than simple LA, thus avoiding an exaggerated response to stress [17]. But the commonly used vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine can cause a rise in heart rate [18]. Hence, the use of vasoconstrictor should be limited in individuals with cardiac disease, taking care not to exceed 0.04 mg of adrenaline. In turn, if anesthetic reinforcement is needed, it should be provided without a vasoconstrictor [14]. Aspiration before any injection is mandatory to avoid intravascular administration [15].",
