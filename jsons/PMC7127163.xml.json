Due to increasing demand on my time by other countries around the world in the past decade, I have not been back to China as frequently in recent years. The last time I visited China before my latest visit in October 2002 was in 1996. So much changes have taken place that I felt it important to report a few of the more significant ones in modern China.",

Despite the accusations that the Chinese authorities have been underreporting or covering up cases of SARS, I saw no evidence of such an occurrence during my visit in October 2002, which included Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai. It only came to surface early in 2003 when, according to a good colleague of mine in Guangzhou who apologized for not promptly responding to my correspondences, as he always did over the many years of our acquaintance, his hospital \u201chad been kept busy with quite a few cases of atypical pneumonia since the Spring Festival,\u201d another term for the Chinese New Year, which fell on February 1, 2003. Most cases of atypical pneumonia reported during that period were indeed cases of SARS. As a matter of fact, the Chinese term for SARS is still atypical pneumonia . Personally, I do not believe for a moment that China was underreporting or covering up cases of SARS. China was simply caught offguard by the sudden appearance of this mysterious disease, which, on the surface, resembled common colds or ordinary flu. Because it occurred during the usual flu season, I could empathize with China's initial \u201cwhat's the big deal?\u201d attitude. To me, the most important outcome of this whole incident of SARS is that China's press and news media have now become completely transparent\u2014a sign of Chinese \u201cglasnost\u201d. Of course, SARS is all history now (Fig. 1)\n.",

The huge success of the world's two of the best known fast-food giants, McDonald's (Fig. 2)\nand Kentucky Fried Chicken, also known as KFC (Fig. 3)\n, is the result of a change of Chinese lifestyles, which are becoming more geared to speed, convenience, and choice. Although most of the Chinese do not like the taste of either hamburgers (Chinese prefer pork to beef) or cheeseburgers (Chinese compare cheese to vomitus), they possess enough curiosity to try them. Furthermore, consumers in China are buying at McDonald's and KFC because they are fashionable in the West, not because they represent their own culture. If every Chinese tries just one fast-food item only once, these McDonald's and KFCs would have rung up US$1.3 billion sales in China. There are now over 800 KFCs [17] and over 430 McDonald's [18] in China. Every kid in China knows the name and can sing the song of McDonald's, although completely unaware of the frightening fact that a Big Mac contains 34 g of fat [19]. More than one third of adults in China and over half of adults in China's urban areas consume over 30% of their energy from fat [20].",

In 2003, the upper limit of normal was 6.0 mmol/l or 232 mg/dl, and the mean value was 5.06 mmol/l or 196 mg/dl [21]. These \u201cnormal\u201d values, which were very similar to those reported recently from another study of 1211 retirees in Beijing [22] and the Chinese MONICA project involving 5 million Chinese from 16 provinces [23], were considerably higher than the normal values in China published in 1958 (155 mg/dl) [24], 1981 (191 mg/dl) [24], and 1997 (200 mg/dl) [25]. In a country known traditionally for its low plasma cholesterol values, low incidence of coronary artery disease, and lean body build, this upward adjustment of the so-called \u201cnormal\u201d values in modern China represents an alarming trend that deserves special attention. This assumes an even greater significance in view of the recent report that blood cholesterol concentration is directly related to mortality from coronary artery disease even in those with\u2014what was, by western standards\u2014a \u201clow\u201d cholesterol concentration [26].",

China is starting to consume more milk, a basic change in the national diet that reflects an upward shift in the expanding Chinese middle class. In old China, milk was considered a luxury, costing more than water or tea. With the improvement of living standards, near doubling of milk production during the last 5 years [27], and the fitness craze sweeping across the country, Chinese are drinking more milk in record numbers\u201425% increase from 2001 to 2002 (Q.Y. Ge, personal communication, April 2, 2003). China's annual milk production has finally caught up with that of its grain alcohol [27]. So, instead of \u201cGan Bei\u201d (\u201cbottoms up\u201d) with the traditional Mao-tai at most of the state banquets, Chinese hosts are now holding up glasses filled with milk. Unfortunately, while the older generations of Chinese have benefited from a diet high in vegetables and fruits and low in saturated fats, a move to too much milk undoubtedly would accelerate the development of atherosclerosis in modern China. Such changes in China's dietary intake will have a great influence on the coronary artery disease burden, as was supported by the recently reported Singapore experience in which the higher consumption of dietary saturated fat is associated with a higher serum cholesterol and higher coronary artery disease mortality in Singaporean Chinese compared with the Chinese in Hong Kong and mainland China [28].",

Furthermore, the Chinese Medical Association just convened its first national symposium on the prevention and treatment of obesity on March 15, 2003 in Suzhou [42]. The recent report that obesity significantly raises cancer risk [43] will undoubtedly add impetus to China's war against obesity because of the Chinese's inordinate fear of cancer.",

This disease entity is encountered more and more often now in China. As a matter of fact, the interventional cardiologists in China have also become quite aggressive in treating these patients with the percutaneous technique of transluminal septal myocardial ablation with alcohol, with one center alone having performed such a procedure in 119 patients with excellent short- and long-term results [61]. According to the Chinese national registry, over 400 such procedures have been performed among 20 hospitals in China by the end of 2002. The Chinese cardiologists have also been actively engaged in laboratory investigations to determine whether it is the volume of the alcohol injected, or the rate of alcohol injection into the first septal perforator of the left anterior descending coronary artery during septal ablation that is important. It was concluded that the size of the iatrogenically induced myocardial infarct in piglets is directly related to the volume of intracoronary alcohol injection, rather than the rate of alcohol injection [62].",

He did not even mention it in his book \u201cChinese Lessons to Western Medicine\u201d [14].(2)Even as recent as 1970s, pulmonary embolism was thought to be rare in China [4] The rarity of pulmonary embolism was even more remarkable when one considered the widespread use of birth control pills among the Chinese women of child-bearing age [4]. Perhaps the use of acupuncture anesthesia [2], [7], [8], [9], which permitted early ambulation after major surgery, accounted for the low incidence of postoperative pulmonary embolism in China. Because acupuncture anesthesia is seldom employed in modern China, this protective factor is no longer operative.(3)More accurate in vivo diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is now possible because of improved diagnostic techniques.\n",

On the long list of organs that should be sequenced, the Beijing Genomics Institute has already started investigations into proteomics and drug discovery, including a project to isolate the active compounds in the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine [92]. There are many Chinese herbs that are widely used in this country, especially for treatment of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. Unfortunately, they tend to interact unfavorably with commonly prescribed western cardiac drugs, including warfarin [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], digoxin [98], [99], [100], [101], and hypoglycemic agents [102]. Therefore, the isolation of the active compounds in these herbs will facilitate the understanding of the pharmacodynamics of these herbs and thus avoid their inadvertent adverse interactions with the western medications.",
