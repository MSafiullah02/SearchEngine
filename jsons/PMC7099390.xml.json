Most picornavirus 3Cpro cleave the peptide bond between a highly conserved P1-Gln/P1\u2032-Gly pair15, 21 (where P1 and P1\u2032 denote the first amino acids on the N-terminal and C-terminal sides of the scissile bond, respectively; in this notation,22 the corresponding subsites on the enzyme are labelled S1 and S1\u2032). FMDV 3Cpro is an interesting exception to this general pattern, since it exhibits a preference either for substrates in which P1-Gln is followed by a relatively large apolar amino acid in the P1\u2032 position or for P1\u2032Glu/P1\u2032Gly junctions.3 HAV 3Cpro can also tolerate larger P1\u2032 amino acids in substrates with P1-Gln.21 Other positions in the peptide also contribute to substrate recognition; in general, there is a preference for a hydrophobic residue at P4,16, 18, 19 and the nature of the P2 and P2\u2032 amino acids, which vary between different picornavirus families, can also be important.8\n",

Overall, it is notable that, within the context of the VP1-2A sequence, variation at all positions from P4 to P1\u2032 (inclusive) can reduce the rate of peptide cleavage by FMDV 3Cpro to between 0% and 50% of the rate observed with the control peptide (Fig. 1a). In contrast, variation at the P5 and P4\u2032 positions at the extremities of the peptide had little impact on peptide cleavage. With one exception, these results are consistent with a previous alanine-scanning analysis of the peptide.8 They confirm the importance of positions P4, P2, P1 and P1\u2032 for substrate recognition, but reveal, for example, that residues at the P3 position can also contribute to cleavage specificity. The only inconsistency noted is that substitution of P4\u2032-Phe (by Arg, Pro or Ala) had little effect on peptide cleavage in the fluorescence assay, whereas it had been found previously in an HPLC-based assay that substitution by Ala abrogated cleavage.8 The origin of this discrepancy is unknown, but the structural results are consistent with more recent findings indicating that the P4\u2032 residue is unlikely to contribute significantly to substrate specificity (see the text below).",

The P4-Pro side chain is not completely buried, since one flank containing the C\u03b4 atom faces outward and is solvent exposed. This part of the side chain is quite close to the carbonyl oxygen of Val141 and to the side-chain hydroxyl of Tyr190 (4.2 \u00c5 in each case). Intriguingly, mutation of the P4 residue to Val, Leu or Ile completely abrogated cleavage of the fluorescent substrate (Fig. 1a), consistent with a previous observation that an Ala substitution at this position also prevented cleavage.8 These results suggest that, at least within the context of the VP1-2A peptide, there is a strict requirement for P4-Pro. Although the structure suggests that Ala and Val side chains, which are similar in size to Pro, should be accommodated in the S4 pocket, they may nevertheless affect the binding conformation sufficiently to prevent proper presentation of the scissile bond to the active site. This is a rather surprising result given the evident malleability of the protease. It is also unexpected, since Ala, Val and Ile are observed at P4 in other FMDV polyprotein cleavage junctions, albeit within the context of different sequences (see Table 2 in Birtley et al.\n8).",

On one side, the Lys side chain primarily contacts the side chain of His46 (the central residue of the catalytic triad), whereas on the other side, the aliphatic portion of the Lys contacts the apolar side chains of Leu142 and Met148. At the distal end of the pocket, which is open to solvent, there are salt bridges from the amine group at the tip of the Lys side chain to two acidic residues from the \u03b2-ribbon, Asp144 (3.6 \u00c5) and Asp146 (2.8 \u00c5) (Fig. 2a). Formation of the S2 pocket appears to be dependent on peptide binding, since Leu142, Asp144 and Asp146 all adjust their positions in the presence of substrate (Fig. 1e). The salt bridges to the pair of Asp residues in the \u03b2-ribbon explain the strong preference for P2-Lys in natural substrates (although it is not yet clear why this preference is strongest in substrates with P1-Gln3). Consistent with the acidic nature of the distal end of the S2 pocket, incorporation at P2 of norleucine (which is structurally similar to Lys but lacks the amine group) abrogates cleavage, whereas substitution by Arg or ornithine (both of which have a positive charge at the tip of the side chain) only modestly reduces the rate of peptide cleavage (Fig. 1a). Curiously, substitution by Thr also abrogates cleavage, even though this residue is found in other natural FMDV 3Cpro substrates;8 it may be that Thr is tolerated at P2 only in the context of the variation of the amino acids at other positions in the peptide substrate.",

The P1 side chain makes three hydrogen bonds to the pocket: two between the carbonyl group and the side chains of His181 and Thr158 (2.6\u20132.9 \u00c5) and one from the amide group to the backbone carbonyl of Thr158 (3.2\u20133.5 \u00c5) (Fig. 2a and c). The pocket therefore displays good chemical complementarity to the P1-Gln side chain. However, peptide cleavage assays previously showed that incorporation of Glu at this position only reduces the cleavage rate by a factor of 2,8 consistent with the common occurrence of P1-Glu in FMDV 3Cpro substrates.3 To investigate this finding in more detail, we determined the crystal structure of 3Cpro bound to a modified VP1-2A peptide, in which P1-Gln is substituted by P1-Glu (VP1-2Am). The structure reveals that the P1-Glu side chain binds in a manner that is almost identical with that observed for P1-Gln in the VP1-2A peptide (Fig. 2c and d). One oxygen atom from the P1-Glu side-chain carboxylate (OE1) makes two hydrogen bonds (ranging in length from 2.4 to 2.8 \u00c5 over the four independent structures) to His181 and Thr158, but the other carboxylate oxygen (OE2) is more distant from the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr158 (3.2\u20133.7 \u00c5) and\u2014assuming that the side-chain carboxylate is deprotonated\u2014cannot form a hydrogen bond. The fact that the OE2 oxygen is also exposed to solvent (Fig. 2d) may also attenuate any negative impact on binding by allowing access to positive counterions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.",

This S1\u2032 pocket is the site of an interesting difference in specificity between FMDV 3Cpro, on one hand, and 3Cpro from HRV and PV, on the other hand. Whereas FMDV 3Cpro preferentially cleaves Gln-Xaa junctions (where Xaa is predominantly Leu, Ile or Thr),3 HRV and PV 3Cpro have a marked preference for cleavage at Gln-Gly junctions.15 Comparison of the protease structures readily accounts for this difference, since the Cys31-Leu47 residues that form the floor of the shallow S1\u2032 pocket in the free form of FMDV 3Cpro are replaced by Phe25-Ala41 in 3Cpro from HRV (PDB ID 1cqq\n25) and PV (PDB ID 1l1n\n10) (Fig. 2c and e; Supplementary Fig. 4).

In this assay, the primary cleavage observed is located at the Glu-Ser junction; further cleavage at the Glu-Gly junctions within 3B1\u20133B2\u20133B3 may be impeded by the low solubility of this fragment (Fig. 3a and b). Under the assay conditions used, wild-type FMDV 3Cpro cleaves over 95% of the substrate within 10 min. The single mutation C31F drastically reduced the ability of the protease to cleave this protein substrate; no cleavage was evident after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 3b), and very partial cleavage was observed after 4 h (Supplementary Fig. 3). We estimate that the reduction in activity is approximately 200-fold. In contrast, mutation to the much smaller Ala side chain (C31A) had essentially no effect on the proteolytic activity of 3Cpro in this assay (Fig. 3b). The considerable reduction in protease activity due to the C31F substitution is probably due to the steric strain that arises from the close packing of the large side chains of Phe31 and Leu47 in the S1\u2032 binding pocket of the mutant, which may have a knock-on effect on the position of His46, a key component of the catalytic triad (compare Fig. 2c and e; Supplementary Fig. 4). This interpretation is strongly supported by the finding that the C31F/L47A double mutation, which reduces the size of the side chain opposite Phe31 and generates an S1\u2032 pocket that resembles that found in HRV and PV 3Cpro, restores near-wild-type cleavage activity (Fig. 3b). The C31A/L47A double mutant is slightly impaired compared to the wild-type protease, perhaps because the P1\u2032 residue is bound less tightly in the enlarged S1\u2032 pocket.",

Previously, we mutated C142 to prevent aggregation of the protein due to formation of intermolecular disulphide bonds, but found that substitution by a large hydrophobic side chain was necessary to preserve the catalytic activity of the protease.12, 13 Although slightly larger, Leu is a reasonable structural mimic of Cys, and the structure of the 3Cpro\u2013peptide complex confirms our previous conclusion that the apolarity of C142 in the wild-type protein is necessary for its interaction with the P4 and P2 residues to ensure a correct presentation of the polypeptide substrate to the active site.12 Consistent with this idea, introduction of the C142L mutation into a type O1K FMDV had no significant effect on the infectivity of the virus in tissue culture (Fig. 5\n). This observation and the fact that the equivalent residue in HRV and PV 3Cpro is a leucine (Leu127) nevertheless beg the question, \u201cWhy is Cys142 strictly conserved in FMDV 3Cpro?\u201d We speculate that this may confer a selective advantage during infection of natural hosts by permitting inactivation of the protease on cell lysis.",

This information is of particular relevance to inhibitor design, although further structural analyses of FMDV 3Cpro bound to different peptide sequences will be needed to map out the full extent of structural changes that accompany substrate binding.",

Our structural and mutagenic analyses suggest that such side-chain movements are very unlikely to occur in HRV or PV 3Cpro, since the F25/A41 pair of residues that lie on either side of the pocket entrance (equivalent to C31/L47 in FMDV 3Cpro) does not have the flexibility to accommodate large P1\u2032 side chains (Fig. 2c\u2013e). This explains the strict requirement for small P1\u2032 side chains (most often Gly) in substrates for 3Cpro from HRV and PV.15, 21 In contrast, HAV 3Cpro, like FMDV 3Cpro, is tolerant of larger P1\u2032 residues (e.g., R, V and M).21 Since it has an M29/A45 pair of residues flanking the S1\u2032 pocket, we suggest that the Met29 side chain may have the ability to move to accommodate larger P1\u2032 side chains.",

The protease structure from this model was then used to solve the structure of the 3Cpro\u2013VP1-2Am complex, again using Phaser.46 In that case, four molecules were identified in the asymmetric unit; the overall log likelihood gain was 3981. Manual model adjustment and refinement of both models were performed with O32 and CNS,47 respectively.",

Up to four different codons (CTN) for leucine (L) could have been generated to replace the Cys (C) residue codon (TGC) in this procedure, but only two were used. The mutant PCR product, including the EcoRI (nt 5058)-PstI (nt 6209) region (numbered according to accession no. X00871), was inserted into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and individual plasmids were sequenced. The EcoRI-PstI fragments containing the CTA (C142L1) and CTG (C142L2) codons were excised and reconstructed into pT7S3 via an intermediate plasmid containing the BamHI fragment (nt 2909\u20137117). The full-length wild-type and mutant plasmids were linearised with HpaI, and RNA transcripts were prepared using T7 RNA polymerase (T7 Megascript kit; Ambion). The transcripts were introduced into BHK cells by electroporation, essentially as described previously.49 Complete cytopathic effect was apparent following overnight incubation. Rescued virus harvests were passaged once in BHK cells, and then RNA was extracted using a viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RT-PCRs, with or without reverse transcriptase, were performed using the primers (3AEcofor and 3CPstrev, as described above) for 25 cycles. The expected products were only observed in the presence of the reverse transcriptase (this ensured that products were derived from the viral RNA and not from residual cDNA template), then the amplicons were sequenced using the same primers and maintained the respective wild-type or mutant sequences as anticipated (data not shown).",
