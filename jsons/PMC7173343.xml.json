            "text": "Infectious clone is critical for analysis of virus properties such as viral replication, movement, symptom development, host range and virus-host interactions. However, full-length clones of many viruses have been proved to be difficult or even impossible to perform molecular manipulation in E. coli due to their toxicity to E. coli. The instability in E. coli has been reported for an array of viruses belonging to potyviruses (Bedoya and Daros, 2010, Gao et al., 2012, Johansen, 1996, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Olsen and Johansen, 2001, Tuo et al., 2015, Yang et al., 1998), tobraviruses (Constantin et al., 2004, Ratcliff et al., 2001), flaviviruses (Aubry et al., 2015), coronaviruses (Almazan et al., 2000), picornaviruses (Zibert et al., 1990) and pestiviruses (Rasmussen et al., 2010). Several methods have been developed to circumvent this problem, including the in vitro ligation method involving two plasmid, mutating cryptic prokaryotic promoter sites in the viral genome, and using intron insertions, low copy number plasmids, specific E. coli strains and low growth temperature (Aubry et al., 2015, Edmonds et al., 2013, Johansen and Lund, 2008, Pu et al., 2011, Siridechadilok et al., 2013, Yamshchikov et al., 2001). For generation of infectious clones of plant virus that are instable in E. coli, insertion of introns in viral genome to terminate expression of undesired toxic proteins in E. coli is the most extensively used approach so far (Desbiez et al., 2012, Gao et al., 2012, Johansen, 1996, Johansen and Lund, 2008, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Tuo et al., 2015, Yang et al., 1998). However, determination of the numbers and locations of intron insertions required to stabilize infectious clones is time-consuming and laborious. Some sequence-independent cloning methods were also developed to assemble infectious clones of plant viruses in vivo or in vitro, such as yeast recombination system (Desbiez et al., 2012, Youssef et al., 2011), Gibson assembly and In-Fusion cloning method (Blawid and Nagata, 2015, Bordat et al., 2015, Tuo et al., 2015), but the assembly products require E. coli transformation for propagation, which means those methods just make easier viral genome assembly, not solving the problem of viral genome instability in E. coli. Thus for plant viruses that cannot maintain stability in E. coli, generation of stable infectious clones by these assembly methods still depends on the using of intron insertions (Desbiez et al., 2012, Tuo et al., 2015), which remains a major hurdle in the research of these viruses.",

This method uses R. radiobacter both for cloning and inoculation, which completely eliminates the need for plasmid propagation in E. coli. Two viruses, PRSV and PLDMV, were chosen to generate infectious clones by using this method. Full-length cDNAs of both PRSV and PLDMV were divided into two fragments for easier PCR amplification. The two fragments were cloned into pGreen-35S vector by one-step Gibson assembly. Then the assembled DNA products were transformed into R. radiobacter and E. coli, respectively, with the same growth temperature 28 \u00b0C. As shown in\nTable 1, the R. radiobacter transformation of PRSV or PLDMV had more than 80 colonies (average for three experiments), while the E. coli transformation of PRSV and PLDMV had 2 and 3 colonies (total for three experiments), respectively. All the five E. coli colonies were sequenced and found to be incorrect genome of the viruses with deletion or insertion mainly in the region of P3 or CI. Seventeen PCR-positive R. radiobacter colonies were sequenced and 15 colonies were found to be correct. The R. radiobacter colonies with correct viral genome were used for inoculation, and 96% of inoculated papaya plants showed system infections with similar symptoms to those caused by the wild-type viruses (Table 1 and\nFig. 2). The systemically infected plants showed visibly mosaic on leaves and water-soaking streaks on petioles at 20 days post inoculation (dpi), and developed severely distorted leaves at 45 dpi, whereas the plants inoculated with the infiltrating buffer were of no symptoms (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Full-length cDNA clones of many RNA viruses, especially (+) RNA viruses are difficult to maintain stably in E. coli. In this study, two potyviruses PRSV and PLDMV (family Potyviridae, positive-sense RNA virus), were demonstrated to be impossible to clone in E. coli. None colony or a few colonies with incorrect viral genome were obtained in E. coli transformation. The infectious clone of Taiwan PRSV isolate has been reported to be generated by E. coli transformation (Chen et al., 2008), but the Hainan PRSV isolate was proved to be impossible to propagate correctly in E. coli in this study. The reasons may be the different sequences of viral genomes between the two isolates, or the use of different vectors. Several other potyviruses also have proved to be instable in E. coli (Bedoya and Daros, 2010, Gao et al., 2012, Johansen, 1996, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Olsen and Johansen, 2001, Tuo et al., 2015, Yang et al., 1998). When the viral genome-encoding plasmids assembled in vitro were transformed into R. radiobacter, the colonies with correct viral genome were obtained with high efficiency. We speculate two possibilities for the stability of infectious clones in R. radiobacter: (i) low copy number of infectious clones in R. radiobacter causes less toxicity. (ii) R. radiobacter is more tolerant to toxicity than E. coli. In fact, using low copy number vectors is an approach to get stable infectious clones in E. coli for some viruses (Almazan et al., 2000, Choi et al., 1999, Gualano et al., 1998, Hurrelbrink et al., 1999). However, this does not always resolve the problem. Many viral genomes are instable in E. coli even using low copy number vectors, so more sophisticated procedures have been used, such as ligation in vitro and insertion of introns. In this study, we used R. radiobacter for both cloning and inoculation of infectious clones, and found that even a high copy number plasmid (pGreen) containing viral genome without intron insertions can be stable in R. radiobacter.",

Bacteria were grown overnight at 28 \u00b0C to obtain an OD600 of 1.0\u20131.5. The cultures were pelleted and washed one time using infiltration buffer (10 mM MES pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 \u03bcM acetosyringone). Then cells were diluted with infiltration buffer to a final OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8, and incubated for 3 h at room temperature in dark before the agroinfiltration of papaya plants using 1 mL syringes without needle. The inoculated papaya seedlings were grown in a controlled environment with a 16 h light cycle at 28 \u00b0C and then for 8 h in the dark at 25 \u00b0C.",
