[9] , the authors describe a female COVID-19 patient in her late fifties presenting with altered sensorium and neuroimaging features typical of ANE. Cytokines are known to have a central role in the pathogenesis of acute necrotising encephalopathy [10] . This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and ANE. Interestingly, there is another form of ANE, referred to as ANE1 which has very similar imaging characteristics. ANE1 is associated with an underlying RAN binding protein 2 (RANBP2) mutations. RANBP2 is a protein present on the nuclear pore and facilitates cellular traffic of proteins and energy balancing [11] . A mutation of this gene makes individuals susceptible to the effects of viral infections. While the imaging manifestations of ANE 1 are similar to that provided in the case, it would be highly atypical for the initial manifestation of ANE 1 to occur in a patient of this age. However, as we continue to learn more about the COVID-19, one needs to keep an open mind about underlying genetic susceptibilities irrespective of the COVID-19 status of the patient. Further, raised CSF protein (>0.45 g/L) in the absence of CSF pleocytosis and the presence of external capsular involvement on imaging would also satisfy screening criteria for RANBP2 [11, 12] .",
