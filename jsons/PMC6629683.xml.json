However, additional tools can aid in outbreak response. Mathematical and statistical modeling has repeatedly proven to be a valuable resource in targeting outbreak response needs, and can inform the effective use of vaccines2, antivirals3, and other countermeasures (e.g. school closures and social distancing). Despite this, and in contrast to research and development of medical countermeasures, few efforts have been coordinated to improve optimization of modeling and other outbreak data analyses during public health emergencies caused by emerging infectious diseases.",

During the first half of the outbreak, public health operations were complicated by situational awareness limited by sparse data availability from the affected countries4. Reports from the ground indicated that the outbreak was growing quickly, but uncertainty about the current and future trajectory of the epidemic slowed mobilization of the public health response4. Faced with that uncertainty, decision makers incorporated information from infectious disease models, with early forecasts indicating that incidence would continue to grow rapidly unless aggressive interventions were implemented. For example, a forecast generated by the CDC predicted up to 1.4 million Ebola cases with no additional interventions or changes in community behavior5. These forecasts likely contributed to the acceleration of the international response and provided guidance for how resources might be effectively deployed.",

Modeling \u201ccross talk\u201d across stakeholders within and between countries is also typically limited, often occurring within a landscape of legal and ethical uncertainty. Specifically, the ethics of performing research using surveillance and health data7, limited knowledge of what types of questions models can help inform, data sharing restrictions8, and the incentive in academia to quickly publish modeling results in peer-reviewed journals contribute to a complex collaborative environment with different and sometimes conflicting stakeholder goals and priorities.",

This new track of outbreak science describes the functional use of models, clinical knowledge, laboratory results, data science, statistics, and other advanced analytical methods to specifically support public health decision making between and during outbreak threats. Outbreak scientists work with decision makers to turn outbreak data into actionable information for decisions about how to anticipate the course of an outbreak, allocate scarce resources, and prioritize and implement public health interventions. Here, we make three specific recommendations to get the most out of modeling efforts during outbreaks and epidemics. Together these recommendations constitute the foundation of an integrative field that is \u201coutbreak science\u201d:",

Rapid development and deployment of infectious disease models was important during the 2009 influenza pandemic, chikungunya, and SARS9\u201311.

Understanding the functional relationship between the public health end-users and model developers is critical to improving capacity during outbreaks. A recent pilot study (n = 29 respondents) in Australia suggests a disconnect between model end-users and model developers, with overall infrequent use of modeling in public health practice due to factors such as a lack of in-house modeling expertise, variable trust and/or comprehension of model outputs, and uncertainty regarding whether models could answer the most important operational questions on the most relevant temporal and spatial scale13. Similarly, state and local health officials in the US reported reluctance in translating pandemic influenza epidemic models into public health action, despite the respondents\u2019 familiarity with such models14. More recently, a limited evaluation of 39 influenza public health practitioners from three US public health organizations indicated that approximately one in five had direct communication with modelers, 67% felt that models should be more relevant to public health questions, and 59% wanted more frequent communication with model developers15.",

Without opportunities to gain experience, modelers do not necessarily understand or anticipate the needs and preference of decision makers. Improved communication and collaboration between the two stakeholder groups would improve the quality and utility of models and the decisions they support. This suggestion is not novel, yet the need clearly remains in 201913,15. To improve these connections, we advocate systematically measuring perceptions of both model end-users and model developers to identify what are the key barriers to functional model development and implementation. For example, stakeholder surveys, focus groups and other qualitative data can identify whether the public health priorities as interpreted by model developers are aligned with end-users, whether end-users trust or prefer particular models (or modelers) over others, and whether major gaps are present in end-user modeling literacy and/or model developer communication.",

Ideally, these programs would involve rotations in the field to experience challenges like rapidly changing information, varying quality of data, critical inter-personal relationships between and within institutions, and evolving public health priorities. The CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service program, a good model for training public health practitioners in applied epidemiology, could serve as a template for a similar program that provides academic modelers and other stakeholders with training in applied infectious disease modeling. Furthermore, training programs of this kind can facilitate research opportunities, as called for in recommendation #2, that investigate relationships and processes between modelers and end users, document current challenges to model implementation during epidemic response, and identify best practices needed to promote integration of modeling into public health.",
