Methods: The infusion management group optimized the intravenous infusion workflow based on Hamer's Process Reengineering Theory and applied it to the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The work efficiency, patients' satisfaction and economic indicators before and after optimization were compared. Results: After the infusion workflow was optimized, average times for preparation drugs and intravenous admixture, and patients' waiting time decreased from 4.84 min, 4.03 min, and 34.33 min to 3.50 min, 2.60 min, and 30.87 min, respectively, patients' satisfaction increased from 66.7% to 93.3%, and the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased from 46.67 sets and 186.6 CNY per day to 36.17 sets and 144.6 CNY, with statistical significance.

The disease spreads rapidly and patients infected suffered from several complications [2, 3] . The Technical Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Infection in Medical Institutions (First Edition) [4] points out that when medical personnel contact patients with COVID-19, they need to take protective measures such as contact isolation and airborne isolation. Intravenous infusion [5] is an important treatment method in the designated hospital for this epidemic. Nurses need to wear multiple layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) in isolation wards [6] , including disposable caps, goggles, face shields, N95 masks, protective coveralls, disposable isolation gown, two layers of shoe covers, and at least two layers of latex gloves. Compared with working in general wards, their physical and mental burdens are greater [7] , as such, difficulties in nursing operation increase, the time to perform the work is longer, work efficiency decreases, and patients' satisfaction decreases due to long waiting time for treatment. Process reengineering is a management idea put forward by Michael Hammer and Jame Champy of the United States. Its purpose is to improve overall work efficiency by optimizing the process. It has been applied to the management of various fields in China and other countries and has achieved good results [8, 9] . Its core idea is to improve work efficiency and optimize productivity by reorganizing and optimizing the organization, composition, and operation steps in enterprise processes [10] . Its main approaches include equipment renewal, material substitution, step simplification, time sequence adjustment, etc. [10] . In process optimization and implementation, continuous improvement should be made to the process in order to obtain the best results. This theory has been applied to management by enterprises and has also achieved good results in hospital management, such as surgical management [11] , ward-nursing operations [12, 13] , chronic-disease management [14] , and others. To improve the efficiency of intravenous infusion treatment in the isolation ward, our hospital used reengineering theory to evaluate the intravenous infusion workflow, searched for the steps that could be improved, optimized the process, and achieved good results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 186, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 275, "end": 278, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 279, "end": 281, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1547, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1550, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2148, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2179, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2183, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2217, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study subjects included 30 patients treated in the isolation ward of our hospital and 30 front-line nurses from January 19 to January 30, 2020.

The possible reason was that when providing infusion treatment to patients with COVID-19, the nurses involved in the medical order processing step and intravenous admixture step after optimization did not need to wear heavy PPE; therefore, the influence on vision and hearing were reduced, and the degree of difficulty encountered was lesser than that noted previously.
