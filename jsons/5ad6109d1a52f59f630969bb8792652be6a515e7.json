            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. SARS-CoV-2 shares both high sequence similarity and the use of the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have provided bioinformatic evidence of potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. However, whether the reproductive system is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined. Here, we investigate the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testes at the level of single-cell transcriptomes. The results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicates that Gene Ontology (GO) categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission are highly enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia, while male gamete generation related terms are downregulated. Cell-cell junction and immunity-related GO terms are increased in ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells, but mitochondria and reproduction-related GO terms are decreased. These findings provide evidence that the human testis is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this rapidly spreading disease.",

The new coronavirus disease has received an official name, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the World Health Organization. It can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and infected patients have a relatively high risk of death [1] [2] [3] . It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76% amino acid sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and is likely to use the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells [4] [5] [6] . Recent studies provide structural and functional evidence that SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells is recognized by full-length human ACE2 [7, 8] . Another experimental study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 employs the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for host cell entry [5] . Collectively, structural and functional studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry.",

Liver function damage has been reported in SARS-infected and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected patients [9, 10] . A recent epidemiologic study indicates that some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have signs of severe liver damage [1] . By analyzing healthy liver cells at single-cell resolution, investigators have determined that ACE2 is significantly enriched in cholangiocytes [11] , suggesting that the virus might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Moreover, a recent study explored the composition and proportion of ACE2-expressing cells in the digestive system by scRNA-seq analysis, and its results showed that ACE2 is not only highly expressed in lung AT2 cells, the upper esophagus and stratified epithelial cells, but also in absorptive enterocytes in the ileum and colon [12] , implying that the digestive system is a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, cardiovascular and urinary systems have been reported as potential organ targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection [13] .",

However, whether the reproductive system is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined. In this study, we investigate the RNA expression profiles of ACE2 in adult human testes at single-cell resolution. Our study documents that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. ACE2-positive cells possess higher abundance of transcripts associated with viral reproduction and transmission, and lower abundance of transcripts related to male gametogenesis. Thus, the reported ACE2 expression in human testes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the male gonad and risk male reproductive dysfunction.",

Cell-cycle scores were also calculated using the Seurat CellCycleScoring function since the cell cycle phase effect was observed. The gene expression matrices were then further normalized to cell cycle scores. The Seurat RunPCA functions were used to calculate the principal components (PCs). We further performed the batch effect correction using Harmony, because batch effects among the three human testis samples were observed.

Since we could not separate Leydig and Sertoli cells as distinct clusters, we combined these two somatic cell types together for subsequent analyses. The UMAP plot revealed that ACE2 was primarily enriched in two major clusters corresponding to spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells, as displayed in Figure 2A . A violin plot further demonstrated that ACE2 was highly expressed in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Early spermatocytes, late spermatocytes, spermatids and other somatic cells had very low expression levels of ACE2, as displayed in Figure 2C . A recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for host cell entry, and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for viral spike (S) protein priming [5] . Feature and violin plots indicated that TMPRSS2 expression was concentrated in spermatogonia and spermatids with relatively low levels in other cell types, as shown in Figure 2B We further analyzed the proportion of ACE2-positive cells of human testicular cells. We found that ACE2-positive spermatogonia represented 1.28% of all spermatogonia in human testis as shown in Figure 3A , with similar expression level of ACE2-expressing cells (1.40% \u00b1 0.40%) in AT2 cells [6] . The enrichment of ACE2 in Leydig and Sertoli cells had a 3-fold higher percentage when compared with ACE2-expressing cells in AT2 cells (4.25% versus 1.40%), as displayed in Figure 3A . In addition, pseudotime analysis provided the trajectory of male germ cell development as shown in Figure 3B , and further suggested that spermatogenesis would be disrupted if spermatogonia were infected and We further analyzed the proportion of ACE2-positive cells of human testicular cells.

            "text": "Mammalian spermatogenesis is a coordinate and dynamic cell differentiation process supported by the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). It is stringently controlled in a special niche microenvironment in testicular seminiferous tubules. Sertoli cells are the only somatic cell type in the tubules and directly interact with spermatogenic cells to control spermatogenic cell differentiation through paracrine signaling [17] . The interstitial cells of Leydig are adjacent to the seminiferous tubules and produce testosterone in the presence of luteinizing hormones to support spermatogenic cell differentiation [18] . Functional abnormalities in male germ cells or these supporting somatic cells cause spermatogenic failure and male infertility. SARS coronavirus has been known to damage multiple organs including human testes. SARS can cause orchitis in humans. SARS-infected patients show testis damage and defects in spermatogenesis [14] . All SARS testes display wide-spread germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubules and leukocyte infiltration [14] . SARS-CoV-2 sharing the same receptor as SARS raises the possibility that the human testis is also a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

ACE2-positive spermatogonia express a higher number of genes associated with viral reproduction and transmission, and a lower number of genes related to spermatogenesis compared to ACE2-negative spermatogonia. ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells express higher genes involved in cell-cell junction and immunity, and lower genes associated with mitochondria and reproduction. These findings suggest that the testis is a high-risk organ vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may result in spermatogenic failure.",
