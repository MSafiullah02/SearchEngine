Expanding testing capabilities to conduct population-wide screening for COVID-19 requires innovation in diagnostic services at both the molecular and industrial scale. No report to-date has considered the complexity of laboratory infrastructure in conjunction with the available molecular assays to offer a standardised solution to testing. Here we present CONTAIN. A modular biosafety level 2+ laboratory optimised for automated RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing based on a standard 40ft shipping container. Using open-source liquid-handling robots and RNA extraction reagents we demonstrate a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing. With five OT2 liquid handlers, a single CONTAIN unit reaches a maximum daily testing capacity of 2400 tests/day. We validate this workflow for automated RT-qPCR testing, using both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and patient samples from a local NHS hospital. Finally, we discuss the suitability of CONTAIN and its flexibility in a range of diagnostic testing scenarios including high-density urban environments and mobile response units.",

Nonetheless, the capacity to perform and access diagnostic testing in most countries is still limited. Attempts to scale up testing for COVID-19 have been hampered by limited laboratory infrastructure, supply line disruption and the logistical challenge of population sampling. Since the first reports of the SARS-CoV-2 virus 2 several studies have proposed new diagnostic approaches that make use of frontier technologies to detect SARS-CoV-2. These include ultra-high-throughput methods based on next-generation sequencing 3,4 , highly informative methods using long-read sequencing 5 , molecular assays that reduce the need for laboratory infrastructure such as loopbased isothermal amplification (LAMP) [6] [7] [8] , CRISPR-Cas13 assays [9] [10] [11] , and immunology tests that detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 12, 13 . These technologies may increase the efficiency and accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the future but will require regulatory approval. National health organisations still largely rely on reverse transcriptase-qPCR (RT-qPCR) 14-16 .",

There have been separate examples of process optimisation for the assay including optimal primer/probe combinations 17 , sensitivity and analytical comparisons of commercially available qPCR kits 18 , and optimised procedures for RNA extractions 19, 20 . RT-qPCR technique is sensitive and reliable when performed in a suitable laboratory, however, the rapid deployment of set-ups and workflows capable of coping with the unprecedented volume of testing required has been a challenge for public health organisations internationally. The workflow for preparing a patient sample for RT-qPCR consists of 3 steps: 1) Sample lysis 2) RNA extraction 3) RT-qPCR preparation. In a high-throughput scenario, RNA extraction and RT-qPCR plate preparation are conducted with liquid handling robots, such as the Kingfisher (Thermofisher), CyBio Felix (Analytikjena) Nuclisens EasyMag (Biomerieux). While these robots enable high throughput processing, this approach also requires unique compatible plasticware and proprietary reagents. This has left users exposed to global competition over narrow supply chains and slowed the expansion of testing capability. No report to-date has coupled the complexity of laboratory infrastructure design and the molecular assay process optimisation to propose a standardised solution.",

For a large, multi-campus university comprising for example 10,000 staff and 30,000 students, a full-time operation of 10,000 tests per week allows every individual to be tested monthly or more frequently if we consider the majority working from home (Fig. 7) . Combined with selective quarantining, this capacity would allow a university to safely resume relatively normal teaching and research practices. (electricity, water) to be operation-ready. The addition of a dedicated, separate facility enables a hospital to increase the scale of its testing without impacting other essential in-house laboratory work and maintains the safety of the main hospital building (Fig. 8) . The flexibility of OpenCell's CONTAIN system allows hospitals to integrate the unit with their own testing process, existing reagents, waste management system, and/or workforce. CONTAIN units can be transported overseas using standard shipping infrastructure, and additional units may be deployed or moved rapidly between hospitals to react to new outbreaks or surges. Large cities make a good logistical case for large centralised testing facilities. In this scenario, we take advantage of the stackability of shipping containers and the modular nature of CONTAIN to envisage a multi-container testing centre [ Fig. 9 ]. The facility, constructed of 39 containers has the potential to run up to 72,000 tests per day at full capacity, and provide office, storage and utility space for the running of the testing centre. This facility could be built rapidly and economically to serve a spike in COVID-19 cases. Once the spike of cases has passed, the facility could then be resourcefully separated back into individual containers and distributed around the country to act as local testing facilities and follow local outbreaks.",

Our laboratories represent a fast, costeffective solution for the shortage of BSL2+ laboratory space, using standardised and widely available shipping container units. Open-source hardware (e.g. the Opentrons OT2), code, and reagents (e.g. BOMB RNA extraction protocols) permits the use of generic plasticware and easily obtained reagents, circumventing supply chain issues by adapting to local or transient shortages. The shipping container laboratory permits global transport and distribution. Land transport allows laboratories to be rapidly redistributed to locations where they are of the most utility, and little or no preparation of the destination site is required. A custom open-source data management system tracks samples through the system, using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) protocol, an international standard which enables integration into the NHS or healthcare systems in other countries such as the USA. Each laboratory is capable of running up to 2,400 tests/24 hours. In practice, considering for example two 8 hours shift this number is likely to be lower but still over 1500 and compatible with current needs.",

As with many components of RNA extraction, magnetic beads kits are in significant demand. We therefore decided to work with the open-source Bio-On-Magnetic-Beads (BOMB) extraction protocol. We made the following major changes to the protocol: removing the DNase digestion step, using a DIY guanidine thiocyanate lysis buffer over TRIzol (Thermofisher) and replacing all mixing steps with repeated pipetting. These changes removed the need for a centrifuge for phase separation and a fume hood for volatile toxic compounds. We also reduced ethanol wash volumes from 400 \u03bcL to 200 \u03bcL volumes to reduce pipetting steps.",

            "text": "When automating the modified assay, we encountered some issues that required troubleshooting. Due to the precision required at various points of this process, we wrote the OT2 protocol in Python. There is insufficient deck space in the OT2 to house the number of filter tip racks required by the protocol. To circumvent this, a box of 96 filter tips is mapped to the 96 well sample plate, and each tip is reused throughout the isopropanol and ethanol wash steps. This significantly reduces the number of tips required to extract a 96 well plate of samples. We also found that the total removal of ethanol from the final wash step was crucial to allow beads to dry. To achieve this, aspiration of ethanol is performed with the filter tips placed directly at the bottom of the well. Since this sometimes results in the loss of some magnetic beads, the tips are only placed this low for the final wash step. To reduce the chance of cross-contamination, all liquid movements are followed by an additional aspiration of 10 \u03bcL of air which acts as a buffer zone. Additionally, the OT2 deck layout has been optimised to minimise the pipette head from crossing over samples. Finally, slightly uneven volumes were occasionally observed when aspirating liquid in the multichannel pipette, we found this to be due to incomplete voiding of liquids. To solve this, excess volume, instead of expected liquid volume, is dispensed.",

As studies have shown the N1 primer-probe mix to give the lowest false positive rate compared to N2 and N3, we decided to use only N1 in the CONTAIN automated assay 17 .",

Efficiencies could be made by switching to a multiplex RT-qPCR, which would save on plasticware, time and reagents 29 . Sample pooling, which involves combining multiple samples in a single well at Station A and testing each sample individually only if the combined sample test positive, would significantly increase the number of tests that can be run by a single CONTAIN unit 30 . This approach, however, is more efficient should the expected number of positive tests be below a certain threshold. Finally, as a liquid handling platform CONTAIN could also be adapted to conduct other types of diagnostic testing, such as ELISAs.conversation and continued twitter output and Dr Rocio Martinez Nunez for their critical feedback.

Tests would be requested by a given entity, logged onto a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and monitored through all stations of the laboratory with the results collated and notified to relevant parties. An open source software application 1 using Ruby on Rails and the PostgreSQL database, deployed on the Heroku Platform-As-A-Service was developed by volunteers over a number of weeks to serve this requirement. The application was designed to satisfy the following requirements: \u2022 Logging the requests for tests from permitted entities (entities defined as members of staff or individuals with access to the platform) \u2022 Logging the collection of samples \u2022 A persistent, valid assignment of samples to a 96 well plate in preparation for laboratory steps A,B and C \u2022 Data export of sample arrangements for feeding into other laboratory hardware \u2022 Receipt and processing of qPCR test results against the validated sample assignment..",
