            "text": "Data accumulated from a number of chemosensory clinical centers suggest\nthat viral upper respiratory infection is one of the most common causes of\nanosmia/hyposmia (Mott and Leopold,\n1991). Although case studies in humans strongly support the notion\nthat viruses cause olfactory dysfunction, the actual basis for viral-induced\nloss is unknown. Similarly, the pathogenesis of post-viral olfactory loss has\nbeen more a subject of conjecture than substantive analyses. Coronaviruses are\nbut one of several families of virus that cause upper respiratory infections\nand have been implicated in post-viral olfactory loss\n(Larson et al., 1980;\nValenti, 1984;\nEvans and Kaslow, 1997).\nInterestingly, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), including the JHM and many other\nstrains, are murine coronaviruses that are neuropathic and have the capacity\nto spread to the CNS via the olfactory pathway following intranasal\ninoculation, causing fatal encephalitis or a persistent encephalopathy\n(Barthold, 1988;\nPerlman et al.,\n1989). A variant of the MHV JHM strain, termed OBLV (for olfactory\nbulb line variant), was adapted by growth on an oncogene-immortalized\nolfactory bulb-derived cell line (Gallagher\net al., 1991). In the accompanying paper, we provide a\ndetailed examination of the lesion that occurs following intranasal\ninoculation with the OBLV variant of MHV JHM and demonstrate that it\nselectively targets central olfactory structures, in particular the olfactory\nbulb (Schwob et al.,\n2001). Following infection, the bulb undergoes a massive degree of\nspongiotic change and neuronal degeneration throughout its extent\n(Schwob et al.,\n2001). Spongiotic degeneration is particularly prominent in the\nouter part of the external plexiform layer and, to a lesser extent, the\ninternal granular layer. In short, the glomerular layer is completely detached\nfrom the remaining deeper layers of the bulb. Further, there is a lesser\ndegree of damage to the lateral olfactory tract and piriform cortex. In\naddition to the central damage, there are also reflected changes in the\nepithelium as a consequence of damage to the bulb. Within the epithelium there\nis a coincident increase in immature neurons and reciprocal decrease in mature\nneurons that is highly similar to the histopathology of one set of patients\nwho complain of post-viral olfactory loss (Yamagishi et al.,\n1988,\n1990,\n1994;\nMoran et al.,\n1992).",

In fact, the notion that post-viral olfactory\nloss might be the result of damage to central structures such as the olfactory\nbulb is not new. Stroop discusses in detail the potential for a number of\nviruses to infect and damage central olfactory structures, affect brain\nneurotransmitter levels and induce behavioral abnormalities\n(Stroop, 1995). Therefore, the\npresent study examined the functional consequences of OBLV infection with\nrespect to performance on a simple air versus odor discrimination task.",

Propanol and propyl acetate were chosen since these\nodorants have been previously studied behaviorally in mice\n(Youngentob and Margolis,\n1999; unpublished data). Moreover, although specific data on the\nrelative sensitivity of the olfactory and trigeminal systems to these\ncompounds is not available in this species, electrophysiological recordings of\ntrigeminal responses in rats (Silver and\nMoulton, 1982) and human perceptual data\n(Doty, 1975;\nDoty et al., 1978) to\nqualitatively similar odorants suggest that sensitivity to these odorants is\npredominantly olfactory, with a small trigeminal contribution. Vanillin and\npropionic acid contrast with each other in that propionic acid is a strong\ntrigeminal stimulant to human observers and in rat electrophysiological\nrecordings (Silver and Moulton,\n1982), whereas vanillin is predominantly, if not exclusively, a\ncranial nerve one stimulant (Doty,\n1975; Doty et al.,\n1978).

The training\nprocedures used to shape the air-odor discrimination were similar to those\ndescribed by Slotnick (Slotnick,\n1984) and are reported in detail elsewhere\n(Youngentob et al.,\n1991a). Briefly, using standard operant techniques, mice were\ntrained to break and hold their interruption of the photobeams located inside\nthe sniffing port. Breaking the photobeams resulted in simultaneous onset of a\n2 kHz (80 dBA) tone and delivery of an odorant stimulus to the diffusing\nscreen for a maximum of 6 s. Stimulus sampling for a minimum of 500 ms\nfollowing stimulus delivery was enforced by a beam hold period of equal length\nthat was defined for the animal by the length of the 2 kHz tone. Failure to\nmaintain the minimum sampling time resulted in aborting the trial, turning off\nthe chamber lights for 6 s and resetting the inter-trial interval (6 s). After\nthe beam hold period had elapsed, the animal was trained to leave the sniffing\nport and lick the reinforcement cup for a minimum of 50 ms duration if an odor\nstimulus had been presented. This response terminated the trial simultaneously\nwith reinforcement delivery. On trials in which only air was presented, the\nanimal was required to withhold responding for the duration of the trial\n(responding in the presence of an air stimulus resulted in termination of the\ntrial). Air and odor trials were presented in random order in blocks of 20\ntrials (10 odor, 10 air) with the restriction that not more than three trials\nof one type occurred in succession. No feedback was given for errors of\nomission (i.e. not responding during an odorant trial) or, except for lack of\nreinforcement, commission (i.e. responding during an air trial) and both\nresponse types contribute to the calculation of performance data (i.e. percent\ncorrect response).

In this regard, mice inoculated with OBLV show\na general malaise that is characterized by a lack of grooming activity, a\nhunched, scruffy appearance, reduced food intake, decreased cage activity and\ndecreased responsiveness to outside stimuli, which is time limited to the\nfirst weeks following infection.

On the second\nday of testing, both animals reached criterion performance, responding to odor\nand withholding response to air trials. In contrast, the animal initially\nanosmic to its training odorant withheld responding to both air and odorant\ntrials. In short, as might be expected from a highly trained animal anosmic to\nits training odorant, the mouse responded to all stimuli as if they were air\ntrials. On the second day of testing, however, the animal's error pattern\nshifted, correctly responding to 96% of the odor trials, but responding\ninappropriately to 73% of air trials. On day 3 of testing, appropriate\nresponding to air trials rose to 88%, over the course of 10 blocks, in\nconjunction with a high level of performance on odor trials. These data\nsuggest that the animals that recovered criterion performance are learning to\ntrack either a change in odorant quality and/or intensity (relative to the\ntraining stimulus) during the testing period. Following achievement of\ncriterion performance, the animals were killed for histological analysis.",

The\naccompanying paper describes in detail the severity, timing and widespread\nextent of the damage to the bulb by comparison with the relatively mild\nchanges in the epithelium of both food-restricted and ad libitum fed\nmice (Schwob et al.,\n2001). The anatomical observations in the behaviorally trained\nmice that are the subject of the present work are entirely consistent with our\nother findings (Schwob et al.,\n2001). Thus, the olfactory epithelium in the behaviorally trained\nanimals is much less severely affected by virus inoculation than is the\nolfactory bulb. All areas of the olfactory epithelium are characterized by a\npopulation of neurons as numerous as in controls in hematoxylin and eosin\nstained sections. Specifically, none of the epithelium is rendered aneuronal\nby the infection (data not shown) (Schwob\net al., 2001). This stands in stark contrast to forms of\ntoxic lesion, such as zinc sulfate irrigation or methyl bromide exposure,\nwhich cause substantial areas of lesioned olfactory epithelium to be replaced\nby respiratory epithelium as a consequence of total or near total destruction\nof olfactory basal cells (Matulionis,\n1975,\n1976;\nHarding et al., 1978;\nBurd, 1993;\nSchwob et al., 1995).\nHowever, the neuronal population is altered somewhat from controls; as in the\nanimals that were the subject of the accompanying investigation\n(Schwob et al.,\n2001), immature, GAP-43 stained neurons were more numerous and\nmature, while OMP-positive neurons were fewer in the inoculated behavioral\nanimals as compared with controls (data not shown). The increased prevalence\nof immature neurons suggests, and the companion investigation demonstrates\n(Schwob et al.,\n2001), that neuronal proliferation is increased in the inoculated\nanimals as compared with controls. Hence, neuronal turnover is accelerated. As\nthe epithelial changes parallel the damage to and loss of cells from the bulb\n(Schwob et al.,\n2001), they are most likely not a direct effect of the\nvirus on the epithelium, but a reflection of the bulb lesion\n(Schwob et al.,\n1992).",

Activation of trigeminal fibers presumably subserves the\ndetection of chemical stimuli following nerve transection (Henton et\nal., 1966,\n1969). Likewise, some human\nanosmics detect the presence of odorants without any preservation of quality\ncoding (Doty, 1975;\nDoty et al., 1978)\nand/or distinguish pungent odorants, such as ammonia and vinegar, from\nnon-pungent ones, such as phenethyl alcohol, in the context of an odorant\nidentification task (Hornung et\nal., 1994; Kurtz et\nal., 1999).

Viral infection that produced persistent anosmia\nseverely depleted the number of substance P fibers, including both the\nfascicles at the basal lamina and the fibers that traverse the width of the\nepithelium, and markedly reduced their distribution along the tangential plane\nof the epithelium as compared with normal (Figures\n4 and\n5). The number and distribution\nof stained fibers was also reduced in the infected, osmic animals as compared\nwith normal, but was less severely affected than in the cases where viral\ninoculation produced anosmia (Figures\n4 and\n5).

The others\nare complete surgical ablation of the olfactory bulb and irreversible\ndestruction of the periphery by zinc sulfate in a limited subset of irrigated\nmice (Harding et al.,\n1978). In the case of direct damage to the periphery, it has been\nwell established that odor detection or normal food finding behavior survives\nas long as a small population of sensory neurons is spared\n(Slotnick and Gutman, 1977;\nHarding et al., 1978;\nHastings, 1990;\nHastings et al.,\n1991). As little as 5% of the normal complement of sensory neurons\nin the epithelium can support normal or near normal threshold sensitivity\n(Youngentob et al.,\n1997). Likewise, animals with relatively small remnants of one\nolfactory bulb can perform a variety of detection and discrimination tasks\n(Slotnick et al.,\n1997; Lu and Slotnick,\n1998). In contrast, the manipulation performed here leaves much of\nthe bulb intact and destroys none of the olfactory epithelium permanently.\nThus, the comparison of the anatomical and behavioral results after viral\ninoculation presents several paradoxes. First, as demonstrated fully in the\ncompanion paper (Schwob et al.,\n2001), the olfactory epithelium is not damaged to an extent that\ncan explain the persistent anosmia, given the aforementioned observations on\nbehavioral capacity following direct toxic lesions of the epithelium\n(Slotnick and Gutman, 1977;\nYoungentob et al.,\n1997). Rather, the changes in the epithelium are largely a\nconsequence of, and vary with, the severity of damage to the bulb.\nNonetheless, a large population of OMP-positive neurons is maintained even in\nthe anosmic animals and the proportion of mature to immature neurons is\ngreater than is observed in the epithelium of bulbectomized animals\n(Monti Graziadei, 1983;\nSchwob et al., 1992).\nSecond, on the order of 25% or more of mitral cells persist in the anosmic\nanimals, which also appears inconsistent with the studies cited that utilize\npartial bulb ablation. Third, the number of mitral cells in osmic animals\noverlaps the range of cell number observed in anosmic animals.",

For example, anosmia may be due to complete\nor near complete disconnection of the surviving mitral cells from the\nolfactory epithelium. Conversely, odorant detection by previously inoculated\nmice may reflect the preservation of synaptic input from olfactory axons onto\nsome of the remaining mitral cells. Other data suggest that few if any mitral\ncells retain dendrites that extend into the glomerular layer after infection\nand damage under the inoculation conditions used here\n(Schwob et al.,\n2001). However, we cannot currently conclude that all\nsurviving mitral cells are disconnected from the epithelium in the anosmic\nanimals because the extent of disconnection from the periphery could not be\nprecisely quantified in these experiments. Because the existing data suggest\nthat any differences in mitral cell connectivity between anosmic and\nosmic animals may be small, it is likely that experimental variability would\nmake it difficult if not impossible to test the hypothesis that differences in\nnumber of connected mitral and tufted cells are responsible for the behavioral\ndifferences between osmic and anosmic animals, in the light of the published\ndemonstrations that function is preserved with very small fragments of the\nbulb (Slotnick et al.,\n1997; Lu and Slotnick,\n1998).
