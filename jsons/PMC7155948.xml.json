Given that the number of patients in severe respiratory failure may soon exceed the number of ventilators currently available in Canadian hospitals, interim measures are needed to prevent rationing decisions until new ventilators are available.",

Recently, the provincial veterinary society also became engaged.",

Through this strategy, we identified at least 91 candidate anesthetic machines. These data have now been made available to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. It should be emphasized that industry partners should be informed about any redistribution of these machines as the situation evolves, to ensure the provision of the consumable items as required.",
