The success of epidemic clones, though not well understood, has been linked to certain capsular types [7, 8], carriage of a pilus islet [9] and various virulence factors [10]. Mass vaccination has reduced the occurrence of MDR Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) clones with serotypes covered by the vaccine. Reports from countries dating to the post-PCV era show a rapid reduction of PCV-serotype-related PMEN-isolates. However, some sequence types (ST) ST320, ST433, ST191 and other highly successful clones with non-vaccine related serotypes rapidly replace the disease-associated endemic clones shortly after the introduction of PCV-vaccines [11]. Capsule serotype replacement in clones targeted by PCVs has also been demonstrated [12], such as a switch from 19F to 19A in the disease-associated high-level penicillin- resistant endemic clone Taiwan19F-14 [13].",

The PCV-7 was marketed in Russia in 2009 but has never been offered for mass vaccination. The extended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with 13 serotypes was licenced in Russia in 2011 (PCV-13, Prevenar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., marketed by Pfizer Inc.), and included in the Russian National Immunization Programme (NIP) schedule in March 2014 [5, 15]. Immunizations are administered in a 2 + 1-dose schedule, with two primary immunizations given at 2 and 4.5 months and a booster at 15 months of age [15]. No additional catch-up immunization has been offered for the rest of the child population [15]. National immunization coverage data are only partially available, but a sharp increase of PCV-coverage was reported by the WHO/ United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund reporting system in the 3 years after the introduction [16]. In 2017, the rates of PCV-13 coverage were 88 and 70% for the 2nd and the 3rd doses, respectively, while the rates for the 1st dose remain unknown since 2014 [16].",

Strains were identified as S. pneumoniae by colony morphology, negative catalase reaction, optochin susceptibility, agglutination in the Pneumo-Kit slidex test (BioM\u00e8rieux, Missouri, USA), and by the bile solubility test [22].

Previous carriage studies in DCCs in Russia have described even higher overall frequencies of asymptomatic S. pneumoniae colonization [30\u201334]. Overall, we found no significant difference in the carriage rates among children with birth weights < 2500 g, birth heights < 48 cm, none or < 3 months of breastfeeding, as well as living with siblings < 5 years. Our study found an average rate of pneumococcal carriage similar to what has previously been described for populations in upper-middle-income countries at a baseline period [35]. The prevalence of carriage is independent of geographical region but strongly associated with accumulated risk factors, such as young age, high-density living conditions, and poor health conditions [36\u201338].",

These findings have previously been observed by others [39\u201341]. Young children aged 19\u201336 months expressed the highest rates of asymptomatic colonization and the widest range of serotypes. Isolates with serotype 14 (paediatric serotype) were linked to children younger than 47 months in our study. The age-dependence analysis showed a low frequency of pneumococcal colonization up to 19 months and a peak incidence at the age of 36 months with a stable decline from the age of 46 months. This tendency has previously been discovered for children living in developed and upper-middle-income countries [35], but not for children living in low-income countries [42]. The seven most common serotypes (14, 6B, 23F, 19F, 6A, 9 V, 18C) from our study were previously described in the group of the ten most common serotypes of IPD cases globally [43], and they are a part of PCV-13. Three other PCV-13-associated serotypes 1, 5 and 7F are not frequently detected among pneumococcal carriage isolates in Russia [30\u201332] nor in other geographical areas [40, 41] but were generally related to cases of IPD in infants and young children [44\u201346].",

Serotype 19A is strongly associated with PEN-resistant cases of IPD and was commonly described shortly after the introduction of PCV-7 in vaccination schedules [48, 49], leading to the inclusion of serotype 19A in the 13-valent vaccine. A high incidence of IPD due to serotype 19A has been associated with a limited number of clonal complexes (CC199, CC320, and CC276). Contrary to that, a study from Russia carried out by Mayanskiy et al. [50] demonstrated that local serotype distribution among non-invasive 19A-positive isolates can occur without vaccine pressure.",

Rates of non-susceptibility among invasive and carriage isolates changed dramatically after the introduction of PCVs in industrialized countries [51\u201353, 58]. Furthermore, non-susceptibility to PEN in invasive pneumococcal isolates after the introduction of PCVs was strongly associated with an increased mortality rate in infants and children, as well as in the elderly [2]. The study found significantly higher rates of PEN and macrolide non-susceptibility than previously reported from Russia before the vaccine implementation [31, 34]. High rates of MDR carriage was discovered during the survey. Similar to the intermediate rate of carriage, an intermediate rate of PNSP was found. Treatment with antimicrobials 3 months before sampling was not a significant risk factor for carriage of PNSP in this cohort. A high concordance between non-susceptibility to PEN and macrolides and genotypes was also noted. Remarkably, a recently published study from Russia demonstrated a significant rise in resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin and clindamycin in disease-associated nasopharyngeal isolates in response to PCV-13 implementation. The growing resistance was explained by the expansion of MDR endemic clone ST143 with serotype 14 [59].",

However, the low rates of antibiotic consumption at outpatient level do not agree with the present study. On the contrary it was found that children were intensively treated with antimicrobials prior to sampling. The low level of consumption published by ESAC should be regarded with caution due to possible bias in the reported sales and self-medication data [62].",

Our study found ST1500 with serotype 23F to be associated with PEN non-susceptibility. A study carried out in Siberia found a high rate of ST1500 carriage isolates which were susceptible to PEN thus contrasting to the Arkhangelsk isolates [32]. Differences in the susceptibility profiles among strains within the country may suggest the acquisition of resistance in response to local antimicrobial prescribing practices. Besides, 1.2% of macrolide-resistant isolates were associated with ST2991 and ST3201. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, these STs have never been associated with macrolide resistance before, which is also may be linked to a local treatment choice.",

The S. pneumoniae population was found to be highly diverse and had common features such as age-dependency, dominant serotypes and the presence of major epidemic clones. High rates of resistance were linked to high rates of antimicrobial consumption in the area. Clonal expansion of several globally distributed pandemic clones was identified in a remote part of north European Russia with low rates of migration and tourism. The effectiveness of PCV-13 introduction cannot easily be predicted. According to international experience, clonal expansion due to replacement by the globally disseminated disease-associated pandemic clones with non-PCV-13-serotypes can be expected. The authors propose setting up a high-quality population-based national/regional surveillance system for asymptomatic colonization and serotype-specific IPD rates for monitoring effects of the vaccination programme.",
