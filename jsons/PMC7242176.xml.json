Previous studies have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 disease have abnormal aminotransferase levels, which raise the possibility of significant COVID-19-induced liver injury [3, 4]. This clinical challenge is even prominent in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis \u2013 in particular, considering their immunocompromised status and worse clinical outcomes than compensated cirrhosis [4, 5]. Acute exacerbation of liver function has been described in decompensated cirrhosis clinical guidelines, although the effects of COVID-19 are not well defined [5, 6]. Since the clinical characteristics and disease course in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis are incompletely defined, in an effort to better understand this clinical scenario, we herein report three cases of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis from three hospitals in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak in China.",

Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia and prolonged prothrombin time (Table 1). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were in the normal range; and aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were slightly elevated (Table 1).

In this study, all patients were admitted to the ICU and two of them died during hospitalization. A possible explanation for this might be the poorer immune function in patents with decompensated cirrhosis, since immunodeficiency is more prominent as the disease progresses [8]. Our data were consistent with previous work suggesting that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and cirrhosis, regardless of the disease stage, had worse outcomes than patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome without cirrhosis [9].",
