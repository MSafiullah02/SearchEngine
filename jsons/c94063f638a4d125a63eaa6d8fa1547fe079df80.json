The laboratory results reflected normal lymphocyteS, normal procalcitonin (PCT 0.04ng/ml) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 96.5mg/L), a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (a-HBDH, 318IU/L), glutamyltrans -peptidase(GGT,136IU/L). The RT-PCR amplification of SARS-Cov-2 virus nucleic acid from a nasopharyngeal swab was tested for four times after admission. We had negative results except The swab of February 20, which showed ORF1ab gene positive, but N gene negative. The serum test of IgG and IgM of SARS-Cov-2 on March 5 and 7 was also negative. After the transportation to specialty hospital, IgM of SARS-Cov-2 was detected in serum, which confirmed the SARS-Cov-2 infection.After admission to our hospital ,The patient was treated with high flow oxygen(15L/min) and arbidol (0.2g, Tid) and his vital sign remained stable for the first three days, Apart from dyspnea and chest pain(Fig. 1).On February 14, He got a high fever with 39.4\u2103,accompanied with dyspnea and palpitation. A short term corticosteroid therapy was given: methylprednisone 40mg/d \u00d7 5d. Moxifloxacin was also given for anti-bacterial therapy. The body temperature turned normal. But the patient still suffered from dyspnea, palpitation and chest pain. He still CT showed inflammation absorption compared to the previous one. The lymphocytes steadily dropped. On March 3, IL-6 in serum was 9.87pg/ml. sulbactam/cefoperazone(sulperazone) was added for anti-bacterial therapy. Human serum albumin , thymosin and ulinastatin were also used. Tocilizumab was given to fight inflammation storm on March 5, The IL-6 in serum rised to141.4 pg/ml on March 7.DiscussionThe SARS-Cov-2 virus nucleic acid RT-PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection. But these test kits have many limitations.Because there are so many interference factors during the collection, preservation and transportation of the swab specimen and high false negative rates had been reported. According to the seventh edition of clinical practice guideline for COVID-19 in China, Nucleic acid detection, gene sequencing and antibody detection can confirm the diagnosis respectively. In this case, the patient had a history of fever, lived in Wuhan and had CT findings of viral pneumonia, which was a suspected case.

The co-infection of HIV gave a reasonable answer. It is widely accepted that IgM provide the first line of defense during viral infection, prior to the generation of IgG. It was reported that after SRAS infection, IgM antibody could be detected in patient blood after 3-6 days and IgG could be detected after 8 days [4] .From the limited data of COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, , 94.83% had positive lines respectively. The test time was at day 8 to day 33 after clinical symptoms appeared. The difference in individual immune response with antibody production may be an important reason for the negative result of IgM and IgG [5] . For this case, 2 months after infection symptoms appeared, IgM of SARS-Cov-2 was detected in serum. The co-infection of HIV may play an important role. HIV destroy the immune system and specific antibody responses were delayed or even vanished, which consequently resulted in a too long course of disease.
