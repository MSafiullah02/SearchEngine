That is, its functional role in each of the tissues affected in the disease needs to be clarified. This will require the use of the tissues themselves or at least the specific epithelial cell types derived from them. However, it may first be possible to more readily establish the basic structurefunction relationships of the molecule employing simpler non-epithelial cells into which CFTR can be introduced. With this in mind we have employed three such so-called heterologous expression systems, each with advantages and disadvantages. Our first aim was to generate relatively large amounts of CFTR protein suitable for structural analysis and possibly functional reconstitution. This was achieved employing the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Despite the fact that the protein produced is minimally glycosylated (apparent Mr = 140 Kd), at least some of it is functional, imparting regulated chloride channel activity on the insect cells. However, only a small proportion of the large amount of CFTR in these cells localizes to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, it has been possible to purify the protein to homogeneity under denaturing conditions, Efforts to renature and reconstitute this protein into synthetic lipid systems are ongoing. As a second system we have established Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines which stably express CFTR in varying amounts. The protein produced in these cells has the same molecular size (Mr = 170 Kd) as in the human epithelial cells in which it is endogenously expressed and localizes primarily to the plasma membrane. Coincident with the introduction of CFTR into these membranes, a regulated C1-permeability similar to that seen in the CFTR-infected insect cells and native epithelial cells appears. It has been possible to purify CFTR from CHO membranes under milder conditions but in much smaller quantities. Its function in lipid bilayers is also being assessed. As a third heterologous expression system, Xenopus oocytes which have special advantages for the study of ion channels have been used. Injection of CFTR cRNA results in the appearance of a CFTR protein of slightly larger than native size (Mr = 180 Kd), presumably because of altered glycosylation. This results in a predominatly C1-selective current constituted by low conductance channels activated by protein kinase A and has no influence on endogenous oocyte C1-channels. The finding that CFTR expression generates the same regulated low conductance C1-channel in diverse systems that do not normally have CAMP-regulated C1-permeability supports the notion that CFTR is an actively regulated anion channel.",

An equal number of non-expressors was routinely observed in all populations of oocytes; these oocytes were not excluded and contribute to the variance in average values. Random complementarity of sense DNA with endogenous or exogenous mRNA's is apparent in some experiments from the partial arrest of expression. In all cases examined, however, the same dose of antisense DNA arrested expression to a greater extent, indicating specific recognition of shark and/or Xenopus H2B mRNA ( Table 1 ). An antisense CFTR 2lmer also arrested expression in this assay, suggesting that both CFTR and H2B proteins are required for generation of CAMP-activated C1 channels by injection of SRG mRNA. Failure to observe complete arrest in these experiments might be due to interspecies sequence divergence (bovine H2B or human CFTR DNA annealed to shark or frog mRNA).",

Strikingly, co-expression of both \"half-molecules\" in the same cell leads to reconstitution of a functional STE6 transporter. In contrast, expression of either halfmolecule alone does not provide any a-factor export function. Thus, both halves of STE6 provide an essentiai contribution to functibn. Further subdivision of STE6 is currently being carried out to provide additional insight into its domainal organization. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a 1480 amino acid protein which contains five regions with amino acid sequences that are similar to previously described functional domains: two nucleotide binding domains, two transmembrane domains, and a regulatory domain (1) . To date, the functional roles of these putative domains predicted from the CFTR gene structure remain unknown. The current interest of this laboratory has been focussed on putative Nucleotide Binding Fold 1 (NBF-1) which we have referred to also as \"ATP-l\", because of its partial homology with ATP domains of known enzymes, particularly the mitochondria1 ATP synthase and adenylate kinase ( 2 , 3 ) . As a single amino acid deletion, namely phenylalanine 508 (F508), within the putative ATP-I domain is responsible f o r approximately 70% o f the known cases of cystic fibrosis, we asked four fundamental questions about this region: 1) What type of secondary structure characterizes the ATP-1 domain; 2) Does this putative nucleotide binding region really bind ATP? 3 ) Does the aF508 mutation bring about a detectable change in secondary structure of the ATP-1 domain?; 4) If so, does this change alter nucleotide binding? To answer these four questions we chemically synthesized and purified two peptides corresponding to the central region of the ATP-I domain, one peptide (PP-67) which included F508 and one peptide (PP-66) in which F508 was deleted.",

A number of investigators have verified this assumption ( 2 , 5 ) , but some radiolabelled markers may be better than others (2) at achieving this goal.

Breathing pattern has been shown to have an influence on the DF of inhaled particles in normal subjects (7) ; its role is less clear in patients with airways disease (5) . Slower breathing and breathholds at end inhalation increase deposition by time-dependent mechanisms, i.e., sedimentation or diffusion.

If the desired effect is relief of bronchial pneumonia, then, ideally, most of the aerosol should be delivered to the bronchial airways. Use of radiolabelled aerosols (as described above) allows gamma camera analysis of regional deposition in the respiratory tract ( 4 ) . A s inspiratory flow rates and particle size ( > 3pm) increase, the probability \u20acor extrathoracic deposition by inertial impaction also increases (10) ; thus decreasing the amount of drug delivered to the lung. Rapid-shallow breathing and high inspiratory or expiratory flow rates will also enhance bronchial airway deposition ( 3 ) . These breathing maneuvers are more critical for enhancing airway deposition in the normal, nonobstructed lung, where particles smaller than 3pm primarily deposit in the alveolar regions of the lung (10) during tidal breathing. However, a significant fraction of particles as small as lpm deposit in the bronchial airways for patients with airways obstruction (5, 11) . Again, these particles were hygroscopic and may have grown some in the lung. In CF patients Ilowite et a1 demonstrated by gamma camera analysis a good inverse correlation between central vs. peripheral deposition (C/P) of aerosolized gentamicin and the FEV 1 (%predicted) of these patients (5) . They also showed a good correlation between C/P ratio and the peak sputum level of gentamicin obtained by having the patients cough after breathing the aerosol. pathways, 1) transepithelial absorption into the bloodstream and 2) transport up the mucociliary escalator for subsequent clearance through the GI tract (12) . The rate of disappearance from the airways can be modeled as the sum of the rate constants for these two clearance mechanisms (12) . Transepithelial absorption of lipid insoluble solutes has been shown to be a function of solute molecular weight (13) . Absorption is slower through the bronchial epithelium than through the alveolar surface (12) . Mucociliary clearance of the inhaled solute is a function of the site of its initial deposition; with particles depositing in more proximal airways clearing much faster than those depositing more peripherally (14) . Schanker et a1 (15) reported half-times for benzylpenicillin clearance in mouse, rat, and rabbit for both aerosolized and instilled drug. It is likely that much of this clearance was by trans-alveolar epithelial absorption. We showed, however, that the combined rate of absorptive and mucociliary clearance of DTPA, a hydrophilic solute of comparable molecular weight (492 daltons) to many antibiotics, from tHe bronchial airways was similar to the absorptive clearance rate alone from the alveoli (12) . Thus clearance half times of 60 -90 minutes might be expected for antibiotics delivered as an aerosol to the bronchial airways in humans. Finally, cough following the inhalation of these aerosols will also enhance the rate of clearance from the bronchial airways (5) .",

This antagonism is due to binding the aminoglycosides by DNA present in purulent sputum (6) and interference with bacterial aminoglycoside uptake by sputum divalent cations and its high ionic strength (6) . Due to the antagonism of aminoglycoside activity by sputum a concentration 2 100 pg/ml is necessary to kill a P. aeruginosa in sputum, while 4 $g/ml will kill the same bacterium in nutrient broth (6) . Assuming that sputum is the target fluid, aminoglycoside concentrations need to be 2 100 pg/ml to eradicate P . aeruginosa. Nebulizer delivery of particles expected to impact in the medium to small airways (< 3.3 but > 1.0 pm mmd) varies twenty-fold among jet and ultrasonic nebulizers.

The peak sputum concentration was 2.72 f 2.44 mg/gm with an elimination half-life of 58 k 30 min; the tobramycin dissolved in a theoretical volume of 31 2 27 ml/kg. Achieving these sputum concentrations three times daily for three months in 21 patients decreased sputum bacterial density from a mean of lo7 to 1 0 4 m 3 cfu/gm. Local pulmonary or systemic renal or ototoxicity was not detected during or after aerosol tobramycin administration (7). 71 patients whose FVW-predicted was within 10% of the best value in the prior 6 months were randomized to tobramycin or masked placebo for 1 month, followed by a crossover to the other regimen. All evaluations were conducted in a \"blind\" fashion. Aerosol ized tobramycin reduced sputum bacterial density from to lo4.* cfu/gm.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that nebulized antibiotic ( 1 , 2 ) and mucolytic ( 3 ) therapies improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. Delivery of drug(s) directly to the lung generally allows much lower doses to be administered relative to systemic therapy and results in a lower incidence of side effects. systems capable of delivering aerosolized drug to the respiratory tract, namely the nebulizer, the metered dose inhaler and the dry powder inhaler. While each delivery system may first appear to be quite simple, there are considerable operational/delivery differences between systems and within technologies (product-to-product). The purpose of this paper is to review these differences and where appropriate, the relevant physical-chemical properties of the formulation such that drug therapy can be optimized.",

MDI's can be formulated as solutions or suspensions. Solution MDI's require the drug to be soluble and stable in the vehicle, which is a combination of propellant(s) and cosolvent, usually ethanol. Suspension MDI's contain micronized drug particles suspended in propellant and usually contain a surfactant to aid in dispersing and maintaining physical stability of the formulation. A metering valve assures that a constant dose of drug is administered with each actuation. Upon actuating the metering valve, the pressurized liquid propellants provide the basic driving force for atomization, while the actuator/mouthpiece determines the spray characteristics and affects the particle/droplet size of the resultant spray. Shaking suspension MDI products prior to dosing is necessary for proper dispersal of drug and obtaining homogeneous dosing from dose to dose. Spacers can be used between the MDI and oral cavity to minimize oropharyngeal deposition.",

The nutritional techniques and professionals involved in attaining optimal growth and health of each person with CF have changed dramatically over the past 60 years. Future advances in elucidating CF are expected to increase the role for nutrition research, care, and education in the eventual treatment of, and cure for, CF. Successful medical management of respiratory disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is based on providing effective pulmonary hygiene. Clearance of airway blockage by secretions will reduce infection, lessen parenchymal tissue damage and improve gas exchange (1) . As members of the health care team the Respiratory Therapist (RT) and Physical Therapist (PT) contribute their skills to assess, educate and treat the CF patient to optimize their respiratory and physical condition. therapy and chest physiotherapy (2). These therapies continue to evolve, and are sometimes the focus of some controversy. Aerosol therapy delivers medications directly into the airways providing topical deposition. Mucolytics are often used with aerosol therapy to chemically reduce the viscosity of secretions. Use of an ultrasonic nebulizer also improves mobility of secretions, while providing more efficacious particle size and deposition. Hand held ultrasonic nebulizers can be used for delivery of aqueous solutions, such as normal saline, bronchodialators and cromolyn sodium, but are not well suited for use with mucolytics or antibiotics due to the viscid composition of these medications. Bronchodialators, most commonly beta-2 agonists, provide relief of bronchospasm, which may be induced with use of a mucolytic or ultrasonic nebulizer. Recent studies show that the addition of an anticholenergic, such as ipratropim bromide (Atrovent), enhances bronchial dilitation in patients with CF (3,4). Antibiotics delivered by aerosol used as long-term therapy have been shown to decrease hospitalizations from recurrent pulmonary infections (5) . Recent studies have shown that Amiloride delivered to the airways by aerosol improves mucus clearance in patients with CF, and is a promising new therapy currently under investigation (6,7). The future prospects for aerosol delivery in gene replacement therapy is a focus of current research in this field. vibration, and assisted cough (8). Adjuncts to this therapy may include forced expiratory techniques (9), positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask (10,ll) or exercise. There remains some question as to the role exercise can assume in the total care regimen (12, 13) , but little question remains as to the benefit that exercise provides in improving working capacity and self image of the CF patient (14) .",

Protein malabsorption results in stool nitrogen outputs which are 2-2 % times normal tending to parallel the steatorrhoea. Reduced pancreatic amylase results in decreased starch absorption, although monosaccharide and disaccharide absorption is normal. Presumably the presence of salivary amylase and intestinal mattase prevents carbohydrate intolerance except occasionally in the very young infant. Fat malabsorption is accompanied by fatty acid malabsorption and essential fatty acid deficiency can be compounded in some children by liver disease and reduced bile acid pool.

Providers attempted to control parents' affective responses by sequencing information.

Too much information made parents feel overwhelmed, while too little caused parents to seek out other, often inaccurate, sources resulting in misconceptions and anxiety. All parents searched out sources other than the CF Center, mostly for experiential information rather than factual information. In addition to information about CF, parents sought help with the financial burden of the disease and making the transition from being told about the illness to becoming the \"teller\" to family and friends.

Specifically, mothers reported that CF caused the child (a) to be \"spoiled\" which led to misbehavior, or (b) to have symptoms of fatigue which led to misbehavior. CF was reported to affect the mother's response to child disobedience by causing her (a) to be lenient in order to avoid symptom exacerbation and child unhappiness, or (b) to be firm in cases where the child's health was involved.",

Second, although as a group children with CF may have levels of adjustment similar to those of well children, increases in illness severity are likely to be associated with increases in anxiety and depression. Finally, it appears that child discipline presents a dilemma for many mothers of children with CF. Specifically, many mothers try to be lenient in order to avoid causing unpleasantness in the child's life, but fear that their lenience causes the child to be \"spoiled,\" and thus contributes to child behavior problems. The dilemma is exacerbated in interactions involving regimen compliance, when mothers feel they cannot be lenient because the child's health may be compromised if the child is noncompliant. Training in parenting skills may benefit these mothers by teaching them discipline strategies that are neither coercive nor overly lenient.",

Finally, in view of the evidence that demonstrates the importance of overprotection on the behavioural and emotional development of the child, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms of overprotection through further research. Secondary effects of the research process include: questioning or changing long accepted clinical practice; fomenting institutional change. Psychosocial research may also raise the status of psychosocial concerns in an institution. Finally, research can be good for staff morale if caregivers are included in the development and execution of the projects. Research can enhance the richness and diversity of a job, can encourage development of new skills and prevent burnout.",

            "text": "10. The muscles of the pectoral girdle arise in complex fashion from the upper portion of the rib cage and insert variously on the scapula, clavicle, humerus and thoracic spine. It seems likely that these muscles may apply considerable forces to the upper rib cage which may affect intrathoracic pressure, the shape of the rib cage, and even the mechanical performance of the conventional chest wall respiratory muscles. However, little is known about the role played in respiration by the extensive and complex array of skeletal muscles of the pectoral girdle (1) . Recently, studies by ourselves (2-4) and others suggest (5-6) that arm posture and/or contractions of the pectoral girdle muscles alter lung volume, rib cage dimensions, diaphragm and abdominal expiratory muscle activity, and overall ventilatory capacity. For example, Celli et a1 (2, 3) observed that vertical movement of the arms in normal subjects and in COPD patients is associated with increases in transdiaphragmatic pressure and more positive end expiratory gastric pressure at a given tidal volume, suggesting that diaphragm activation is enhanced and that the abdominal expiratory muscles are more active with the arms elevated. Furthermore, Criner et a1 (4) have found that arm elevation enhances maximum static inspiratory mouth and esophageal pressures at any given lung volume in normal subjects. Augmentation of maximum static inspiratory pressure was associated with enhanced outward displacement of the rib cage but no change in the diaphragm electrical activity. Although increases in maximum static pressure with arm elevation has several possible explanations, at least one possibility is that arm elevation enhances the mechanical advantage of the pectoral girdle muscles which have an inspiratory action on the rib cage. Finally, DeTroyer and Estenne (7) have observed that voluntary activation of the pectoral major muscles in patients with C5-, spinal cord injuries (in whom diaphragm and intercostal activation is not possible) is associated with a significant reduction in expiratory lung volume. These authors concluded that the pectoral muscles may exert an important expiratory action on the upper rib cage.",

In man, the need to be non-invasive limits the assessment of important variables which define pectoral girdle muscle function on the rib cage (e.g., muscle fiber length, fiber orientation with the rib cage, etc). Hence, we used a canine model to study the mechanical action of the pectoral muscles (which are anatomically arranged similar to man) in greater detail. Preliminary data indicates that the canine muscles of the pectoral girdle (at least the deep pectoral) may indeed have an important respiratory action, however, this mechanical action is complex and depends upon lung volume and the posture of the upper extremities (8). With the upper extremities elevated, isolated contraction of the deep pectoral muscle results in inspiratory changes in lung volume and intrathoracic pressure. With the upper extremities alongside the torso, contraction of the muscle results in expiratory changes in lung volume and intrathoracic pressure. Differences in the quality and magnitude of changes in intrathoracic pressure and lung volume in the different upper extremity postures appears to be due to a realignment of the pectoral muscles with the rib cage and changes in their muscle fiber length, respectively (8).",

Unfortunately, most of these studies were performed using surface recordings of muscle electrical activity which are limited by a variety of technical problems. Recently, we have examined the EMG of the pectoralis major muscle during eupneic breathing in 3 COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure while weaning from mechanical ventilation (1 1). Pectoralis major EMG activity was measured using fine wire, needle electrodes. In all 3 subjects, we found that electrical activation of the pectoralis muscle occurred spontaneously with the onset of inspiratory flow. In addition, we have measured pectoralis major EMG activity in 5 normal subjects during voluntary inspiration from FRC to TLC. As normal subjects approached 60% of their TLC, inspiratory activity of the pectoralis major became evident. These data appear to support the notion that the pectoral girdle muscles are important agonists of the primary inspiratory and expiratory muscles when ventilatory demand is high, the mechanics of breathing are deranged, or when the primary muscles of inspiratory are placed at mechanical disadvantage by severe hyperinflation. Rehabilitative strategies that incorporate selective strength training of the pectoral girdle muscles and positioning of the arms during the activities of daily living may be beneficial in selected pulmonary patients. The respiratory muscles, like other skeletal muscles can be trained for improved performance. The first report of specific training of the respiratory muscles for improved strength and endurance appeared in 1976. Leith and Bradley were the first to carefully demonstrate that respiratory muscle function could be improved-by specific training -(1). Their study was done in normal humans but paved the way for a multitude of studies which have followed in-the past decade and-a-half. VMT has now been used in patients with neuromuscular disease, especially quadriplegia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema and cystic fibrosis ( 2 ) . The response to endurance training depends on several factors including intensity, duration and frequency of exercise. Final recommendations for the appropriate strategies to be used in ventilatory muscle training cannot be made as VMT is still in its -infancy .",

Because alinear resistances are used, the mouth pressures and consequently the inspiratory load is very dependent on inspiratory flow rates ( 6 ) . It became apparent after several years using these devices that even though smaller orifices were employed, the inspiratory load was not necessarily increased. In some cases, patients learned to minimize the inspiratory load by breathing more slowly and reducing inspiratory flow rates. This has reduced the value of many of the early studies in which breathing strategy was not controlled as it is not possible quantify the training stimulus. In cases where improved endurance was noted (that is, improved ability to breathe through a smaller orifice) it is not clear whether this was due to a real improvement in inspiratory muscle function, or due to a learned, more efficient breathing strategy. More recently, this point has been taken into consideration and several studies has shown improved respiratory muscle strength and endurance for loaded breathing after ventilatory muscle training ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) . In two studies ( 8 , 9 ) the improved respiratory muscle performance was also associated with a reduction in dyspnea. Symptoms of dyspnea as recorded by a Borg scale during loaded breathing were also reduced after six weeks of ventilatory muscle training (10).",

These include 1) improved respiratory muscle strength; 2 ) improved respiratory muscle endurance for loaded breathing; and 3 ) very probably an improvement in symptoms of dyspnea. The studies which have used controlled resistive breathing ( 7 , 8 ) have achieved the best results. Although hyperpneic training improves muscle endurance, no improvement in symptoms resulted. It is possible therefore, that the nature of the training load is important in providing both improved endurance and reduction in symptoms. Conceivably, a combined training load which provides both an endurance and strength stimulus is the best type of training to use. Studies are currently underway to evaluate this hypothesis. Until completion of this, it is difficult to give firm recommendations with respect to ventilatory muscle training. In the interim, it would seem however, that VMT with a resistive or high threshold load (30-50% of maximal inspiratory pressure) will improve ventilatory muscle function and may reduce symptoms in patients with chronic airflow limitation. For the first four decades of the care of patients with cystic fibrosis, caregivers could only watch many of their young charges develop respiratory failure and die with acute respiratory insults. Most CF patients seemed unable to tolerate mechanical ventilation1. Endotracheal intubation removed the ability of the patient to cough and to clear the airway of purulent material. Even those patients fortunate enough to be successfully extubated usually had a marked deterioration in their lung function.",

On the basis of functional criteria, epithelial cells appear to contain multiple subtypes of several important transport proteins, e.g. CI channels or K channels, which may play distinctly different roles in the life of the cell. Unfortunately, however, Nature has not provided us with an equivalent multiplicity of specific inhibitory ligands (analogous to the toxins which act on voltage-dependent channels in excitable cells) which can be used to implicate individual transporters in an integrated setting. Resolving this dilemma will require, not only the application of molecular cloning techniques to a variety of transporters, but also detailed, quantitative characterization of transport properties so that a functional fingerprint can be applied to the transport process in the cell of interest and to the cloned protein expressed in another system. 122 1991 Cystic Fibrosis Conference ithebl Cells Work W e r in G r o w A particularly vexing property of epithelial cells is that they do not necessarily retain their differentiated transport properties if they are isolated from one another (2). This behavior compels us to develop better assays for apical, basolateral and cytosolic events in the transporting cell layer (3). One approach to this problem is the use of cell layers which have been apically permeabilized by amphotericin or digitonin so as to permit some degree of access to the cell interior while nevertheless preserving the functional integrity of the cell layer. Such preparations may permit the reconstitution of differentiated function under conditions of controlled cytosolic composition. Equally important, however, is the application of relatively noninvasive probes or \"reporters\" which can be used to monitor cellular composition or membrane properties during regulatory alterations in transcellular transport.",

The degree of steatorrhea varies considerably from patient to patient. Although numerous factors likely contribute to this problem, there does appear to be a direct relationship between severity of steatorrhea and residual endogenous pancreatic enzyme secretion. Similarly, the response to enzyme replacement therapy is extremely variable as some patients correct maldigestion with small amounts of enzymes while others show little improvement on massive doses. Pancreatic Extracts Most conventional enzyme preparations consist of desiccated porcine pancreatic extracts. The lipase (colipase) content of these preparations, probably the most important determinant of effectiveness, varies from approximately 3 to 20,000 units per capsule. The patient must receive adequate amounts of a potent preparation. However, too much enzyme carries the risk of hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia due to the high purine content of pancreatic extracts. To protect the enzymes from acid/peptic inactivation, acid resistent enteric coated preparations are widely used. The early enteric coated preparations, constituted in tablet form had poor bioavailability and due to their large size were selectively retained in the Symposia Session Summaries 149 stomach. In theory, the newer microsphere preparations enter the duodenum mixed with chyme. Several groups of investigators have shown that microsphere preparations are as efficacious, or more efficacious than conventional enzymes, for treating fat maldigestion in Cystic Fibrosis. Also, there is some evidence that sequential increases in enzyme dose does improve steatorrhea, but in most studies the starting dose was extremely low. In our experience at least 30% of patients continue to have severe steatorrhea despite large doses of microsphere preparations.",

Five to ten percent undergo mechanical ventilation, and mortality remains between 4-7% (1-3). Protein calorie malnutrition, immunodeficiency, essential fatty acid ( E F A ) , and vitamin deficiencies contribute to increased susceptibility to infection, with 20% acquiring pseudomonas by 12 months. Although complications are theoretically preventable by neonatal screening and early therapy, there is no evidence that early diagnosis improves survival. Growth in infants with CF is affected by prenatal and genetic factors, pancreatic insufficiency (PI), and pulmonary disease. The nutrient deficit results from a combination of inadequate intake, abnormal loss, and an increased requirement. Malabsorption occurs mainly 2' to PI, with 80-85% lacking trypsins (to digest protein) and lipases (to digest fat), together with excess fecal bile acids; despite enzyme replacement steatorrhea does not normalize, and malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins and some trace minerals is concurrent (4).",

Since pancreatic function in infancy shows wide variation and fluctuation (ll), it is difficult to easily select those who would benefit from a predigested formula. There is good data that predigested formula is advantageous for infants with meconium ileus and neonatal surgical complications, due to the glucose polymer composition and the high levels of MCT.

Predigested formulas are particularly advantageous for infants with meconium ileus and complicated neonatal surgical courses, and those with co-efficients of fat absorption ~7 5 % . Almost every mother considers the option of breastfeeding for her newborn baby, a practice encouraged strongly by the American Academy of Pediatrics.l As reviewed by Cunningham et a1.7 breastfeeding provides protection against gastrointestinal infections, significant reductions in nongastrointestinal infections (including meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia), decreases the risk of otitis media, and may protect against certain immune system disorders seen in later life such as celiac disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Breast milk, however, which has only about half the protein and salt included in infant formulas frequently given to infants with CF may not be the best primary source of nutrients for these infants. Adverse effects resulting from breastfeeding CF infants who are not receiving pancreatic enzymes have included hypoproteinemia and edema due to malabsorption. Luder et al.3 surveyed the 124 CF centers in the United States CF Foundation Directory regarding breastfeeding recommendations. A total of 77% of CF centers recommend breastfeeding alone or in combination with pancreatic enzyme supplements and/or hydrolyzed formula. Most frequently cited reasons for not recommending breastfeeding were marked steatorrhea (2 1.5%), protein-energy malnutrition (5 1.1 %), and meconium ileus (1 1.9%).",

Routine evaluation of health and weight status during the breast-feeding period is recommended. Evaluation of medications used by women during lactation is advised. Although the available case data is limited, the nutrient content of breast milk seems to be effected by exacerbation of CF disease. The fat soluble vitamin content of breast milk has been described in only one woman with CF, and there is no information regarding total vitamin content of CF breast milk. Macronutrient (fat, protein, carbohydrate) content of human milk from healthy women with CF appears to be within normal limits, but the abnormal content of specific lipid fractions raises the possibility that the infant fed only breast milk could be subjected to a diet deficient in certain essential fats. Growth and development of infants breast-fed by women with CF should monitored frequently throughout the breast-feeding period. Disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria is most commonly found in patients with underlying pulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus (1, 2) . From an epidemiologic perspective, patients with cystic fibrosis would appear to be at high risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial disease because of bronchiectasis and diabetes. The American Thoracic Society recommends that several criteria have to be met to make a diagnosis of disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria (3) . There must be radiographic evidence of disease without other cause; at least two sputums that are smear positive and/or yield moderate growth on culture; and failure to clear the organism with pulmonary toilet. Mycobacterial disease may not be suspected in patients with cystic fibrosis in whom cough, sputum production, low grade fever, malaise, hemoptysis and an abnormal chest Xray are ascribed to their underlying disease.",

We wished to determine the incidence of mycobacteria disease in an adult US CF population to determine if there was any association of mycobacterial disease with longevity, with the severity of pulmonary disease, with the N M clinical score, with CXR appearance or with the incidence of diabetes. We recognized that the prevalence of nontuberculous rnycobacteria is lower in the Pacific Northwest than in other geographical locations in the US (1 0,l l), and felt that our results may underestimate the prevalence of infection of other areas. In December 1990 we commenced a prospective Symposia Session Summaries 161 trial of all adult CF patients at the University of Washington Medical Center.

Even individuals with normal rates of enzyme secretion have reduced rates of fluid secretion, suggesting that abnormalities in ductal electrolyte secretion are a primary cause of pancreatic dysfunction (1) . Microperfusion studies suggest that the mechanism for NaHC03 exit by the pancreatic duct depends on apical Cl/HCO, exchange to drive HCO, secretion in parallel with a C1 conductance for returning C1 to the lumen (2) . A defect in the CAMP-dependent regulation of this apical C1 conductance would impair the recycling of C1 to the lumen and abolish the driving force for HCO, exit from the cell.

They are large Type I membrane proteins and some are quite well characterized and therefore excellent as models. For Influenza hemagglutinin, which we have used most extensively, the X ray structure of the ectodomain is known. The synthesis, folding, oligomerization, and intracellular transport follow the rules and pathways of normal plasma membrane proteins. In the lecture I will go through the fate of this protein and other viral glycoproteins from co-translational folding to surface expression. I will also show what is known about the fate of misfolded viral glycoproteins: why they remain in the ER and what determines their retention and degradation. The cell biology of protein folding, oligomerization and intracellular transport is of general importance for understanding the pathology of numerous genetic diseases. In recent studies we have explored the role of signal transduction proteins, G proteins, in the regulation of vesicluar trafficking of newly-synthesized proteins to the cell surface. One of the heterotrimerie Gai subunits, ai-3 is uniquely found in the Golgi complex of epithelial cells (3). Gai-3 is a resident Golgi protein which is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of Golgi cisternae. In some epithelia, Gai-3 is also localized at the apical cell surface where it regulates Na+channels (4). In order to study the functions of Gai subunits we have overexpressed different G a subunits on Golgi membranes or at the cell surface by transfection into epithelial cells on inducible promoters (3). These cells have been utilized to study the effect of overexpression of Gai-3 on Golgi cisternae on the trafficking of a constitutively trafficked secretory heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (5). We found that overexpression of the ai-3 subunit retards HSPG secretion and causes it to accumulate in the medial-trans Golgi (5). This effect is reversed by treating the cells with pertussis toxin which specifically ADP-ribosylates, and uncouples, Gai-3. Activation and inhibition of both heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins respectively, with GTPyS, blocks intracellular trafficking at several different stages between the ER and the cell surface. These data are the first evidence that heterotrimeric G proteins are involved, not only in the regulation of ion channels and other effectors at the cell surface, but also in the trafficking of proteins to the cell surface. The possibility that Gai-3 is also coupled directly to CFTR or a related transmembrane protein on Golgi membranes is being explored.",

In this regard, the molecular-basis of CF would mlmlc that causlng the Z-form of heredltary emphysema, where a-1 antl-trypsln fails to traffic normally In liver cells, and that causing some forms of famlllal hypercholesterolemia where LDL receptor falls to reach the cell membrane. Using an IAA-94 column we purified four proteins (Mr 95, 6 4 , 40 and 27 kDa) and the column eluate was able to reconstitute C1 channels. Because the affinity of IAA-94 was only 1 pM, it was likely that some of these proteins were merely \"drug-binding\" proteins rather than C1 channels. Indeed, N-terminal sequence of the 95 kD protein showed that it is the Na,K,ATPase which is known to be inhibited by ethacrynic acid. The 27 kD protein turned out to be glutathione-S-transferase an enzyme one of those whose forms is assayed by using ethacrynic acid as a substrate. Since IAA is a derivative of ethacrynic acid, it is not surprising that we purified these proteins. The 40 kD protein was not very consistent. We made an antibody to the 6 4 kD protein which was able to deplete C1 channel activity from solubilized membranes. In pancreatic epithelial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis, the antibody stains the apical membrane and intracellular organelles such as golgi and endosomes. and the clone (called H2B) had a fusion protein of about 70 kD. The antiserum was incubated with the fusion protein and eluted. The anti-H2B antibody was also able to deplete C1 channel activity from solubilized membranes suggesting that this protein is indeed the C1 channel or some very necessary component of it. We have sequenced this cDNA; it does not have the 5' initiation site but we have an open reading frame that codes ofr 480 amino acids. By primer extension, there are about 800 more nucleotides 5' to our clone.",

Strategies for gene therapy of cystic fibrosis in the respiratory epithelium have been forthcoming with the cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene (1,2,3) followed by cDNA reconstitution of normal, regulated, chloride conductance (4, 5, 6) in cell lines derived from patients with cystic fibrosis (7, 8) . Despite these advances, little is known about the physiologic effects of CFTR expression in the various cell types of the airway. What cell(s) of the airway, ciliated, secretory, basal, or all, are normally involved in the physiologic chloride homeostasis of the airway? Do all cell types in the airway have the ability to confer CAMP regulated currents with transgene expressed CFTR? Are there detrimental effects of ubiquitously expressing CFTR in all cells of the airway? What percentage of the airway must express CFTR to regulate normal chloride conductance? These basic questions must be answered before gene therapy for the cystic fibrosis airway will become feasible. In the absence of an animal model for cystic fibrosis, addressing several of these questions becomes more difficult. Therefore we have been studying a tracheal graft model system in which intact mucocilliary epithelium can be manipulated to study the expression a CFTR transgene.",

This observation supports the existence of a progenitor cell subpopulation with tremendous regenerative potential.

EM of 42 day grafts allowed for the identification of cell types not distinguishable by light microscopy such as: intermediate cells (non-ciliated columnar without secretory granules), serous cells (non-ciliated columnar with dense secretory granules), and brush cells.

For example, the lipid composition of liposome can be formulated as to allow the liposome to destabilize in an acidic pH enviroment (6) . The pH-sensitive liposomes when endocytosed by cells release their contents into cytoplasm by fusing with and/or rupturing the endosome membrane. Recently we have also showed that protein kinase C activators can be incorporated into the liposome membrane to stimulate the expression of the delivered DNA in host cells (7) . Furthermore, antibody can be used to coat the liposome surface and direct the liposomes to a specific target (8) . However, the process of entrapping DNA into liposomes with the original protocol was somewhat complicated, time-consuming and with low efficiency (9). We have developed a new protocol with which DNA can be entrapped into liposomes by freeze-thawing a mixture of preformed small liposomes and DNA (7).",

Since synthesis of GDPmannuronic acid (a precursor for alginate) involves double oxidation of mannose, it is likely that there is a regulatory link between the state of electron transport chains and availability of terminal electron acceptors with the activity of genes controlling alginate synthesis. The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, produces a variety of extracellular products that aid the establishment and maintenance of chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients (1 ,2) . One product, exoenzyme S , may contribute to the pathogenicity of chronic infections by causing local damage and promoting the spread of the organism throughout the lung (3). In animal model systems, mutants that do not express exoenzyme S have been shown to cause little or no histological damage to pulmonary tissue (43). In contrast, infection with parental strains results in bronchiocentric lesions and extensive parenchymal changes. Treatment of bronchial fibroblasts in culture with as little as 100 ng of exoenzyme S results in cellular membrane damage and vacuolation (6).",

The requirement of a eukaryotic protein for activity is also shared by cholera toxin (ARF) and the adenyl cyclases of B. pertussis and Bacillus anthracis (calmodulin) (9) .

However, there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the response of each gene to Pi. The gene encoding PLC-N is considerably more sensitive to environmental levels of Pi (>30X repressed by Pi) than the gene encoding PLC-H (<8x repressed). Regulation of both PLC's by Pi is at the transcriptional level and dependent upon the phoB gene product which is a member of the family of two component regulatory proteins in procaryotic organisms. Furthermore, salient to the potential role of PLC production in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, we have found that the production of both enzymes is regulated at the transcriptional level by compounds that are known to play an important role in osmoregulation in procaryotic as well as eucaryotic cells. These compounds known as osmoprotectants are derived from one of the substrate products of PLC cleavage of phosphatidylcholine, the major component of lung surfactant. These osmoprotective compounds include phosphorylcholine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine. PLC-H is produced when as little as 0.7mM choline or the other osmoprotectants are added to media that contain excess Pi (ie. >lOmM). In contrast, while the production of PLC-N is not induced by these compounds in excess Pi, its production is further induced by these compounds as much as 10-20X above the levels produced in Pi limiting conditions alone. Neither PLC is produced in a Pi sufficient environment if these osmoprotectants are not present. Also, relevant to the potential role of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections in CF, is the observation that choline will completely overcome the inhibition of PLC production by concentrations of NaCl as high as 500mM. Furthermore, in contrast to the inhibition of PLC production by the high osmotic pressure and ionic strength produced by NaCl, an equivalent high osmotic pressure produced by the nonionic osmolyte sucrose, will not inhibit production of PLC. Remarkably, addition of choline to a high osmotic environment resulting from the neutral osmolyte sucrose, will enhance the production of PLC an additional 10-20X.",

It may be possible to block the production of this virulence determinant by using analogues of the osmoprotective compounds described above. Such analogues could competitively inhibit induction of PLC in the lungs of CF patients thereby reducing the availability of the natural osmoprotective compounds such as choline and betaine. It is possible that by abrogating the production of PLC, the survival of P . aeruginosa would be jeopardized in the high osmotic pressure environment of the CF lung .",

The earliest changes noted were plugging of bronchi and bronchioles by secretions without evidence of inflammation. Secondary inflammatory lesions with purulent exudate, and thickening and infiltration of airway walls with inflammatory cells were followed by bronchiolectasis and bronchiectasis. Bedrossian and coworkers (2) found mucopurulent plugging of airways in 67% of infants less than 4 months of age and in 75% of infants 4-24 months old. In these same two groups, bronchiectasis was noted in 20% and 75%, respectively.",

As discussed, the increased thoracoabdominal pressure gradient and the impaired effectiveness of the antireflux barrier in CF results in a significantly increased exposure of the esophagus to the corrosive effects of acid and pepsin. Prolonged intraesophageal pH monitoring is currently the best method for quantifying the frequency, duration and temporal distribution of GER. We monitored 8 patients with CF (ages 7-26 yr), and poor pulmonary function for a 24-hr interval and found that the number of reflux episodes, the % time pH was <4, the number of episodes >5 min in duration, and the duration of the Ion est episode were all significantly prolonged compared to published control values (8) . Fiegelson et al. (1 2yperformed incidental esophagoscopy in 49 CF patients (ages 1-38 yr) who were undergoing fibro-optic bronchoscopy -63% had reflux esophagitis and in 51 % there was frank ulceration. There was a strong positive association between the severity of respiratory disease and the occurrence of esophagitis. Cystic fibrosis has not been shown to affect gastric secretion or emptying in any fashion that would increase the volume of gastric fluid available to reflux, or the corrosive potency of that fluid. However, when it develops, esophagitis can alter motility and impair clearance of refluxed material (9) . Furthermore, enlargement of the submandibular salivary glands is common in individuals with CF (1 3), and it is possible that their total salivary output and bicarbonate secretion is reduced. This could diminish the buffering capacity of saliva, prolong the time 204 1991 Cystic Fibrosis Conference and increase the number of swallows required to neutralize and clear refluxed acid. Lastly, the tissue resistance to refluxed material may be impaired in patients with CF if malnutrition is sufficiently severe to reduce the potential for cell turnover in the esophageal mucosa.",

GER could adversely affect pulmonary function in patients with CF through a variety of mechanisms, many of which were first characterized in patients with asthma (1 0, 14, 15) . Firstly, esophageal acid infusion can induce a 10-20% increase in airway resistance (reflux-induced bronchoconstriction). This response is vagally mediated and the esophageal acid receptors exhibit a greater sensitivity in patients with reflux esophagitis. Furthermore, esophageal acid-induced bronchoconstriction seems to amplify the effect of other bronchoconstrictive stimuli. Secondly, very small amounts (0.05 ml) of intratracheal acid can produce dramatic (4-to 5-fold) transient and vagally mediated increases in total airway resistance. Lastly, larger aspirations of acidic solutions, with or without food particles, will result in a chemical and/or infectious pneumonitis. Recurrent chronic aspiration would significantly exacerbate the chronic pulmonary inflammatory process that is characteristic of CF, but has rarely been a problem in our CF clinic even in those patients receiving supplemental nighttime nasogastric tube feeding A variety of diagnostic methods are available to document the temporal association between reflux, and aspiration or respiratory symptoms (10) . We recognize that patients with CF have an increased tendency to GER (8) , that pulmonary function is significantly worse in those CF patients with, as compared to those without GER (5), and both reflux and episodes of pneumonia are reported to have been reduced after fundoplication (6) . Yet there is currently little more than anecdotal and circumstantial information in the literature to suggest that GER commonly and significantly exacerbates the pulmonary dysfunction in patients with CF. However, the potential mechanism is there and controlled studies will need to be done to clarify the situation.",

Initial therapy should be directed towards optimizing treatment of the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and medical management of the reflux. Recognizing that patients with CF present with a greater than normal anaesthetic and surgical risk, fundoplication should at the present time be reserved for those infrequent patients in whom aggressive medical management fails and there is good evidence to suggest that GER is causing failure to thrive, esophagitis, or repeated aspiration.

In the area of obesity, for example, it has been found that overweight children eat at a faster rate ( 3 ) and leave less food on their plates (4) than normal weight peers. Observational data on parent-child interactions with obese children have indicated important differences between parents and their obese and nonobese children. Mothers have been found to offer less food and fewer second helpings to their normal weight children than to the obese sibling (5) and in general, parents are more likely to attend to children's food refusal than to their requests for food ( 6 ) . Similarly, studies of parent-child interactions in children with feeding problems of food refusal have found that child food refusal is associated with parental use of coaxing and criticism to increase food consumption ( 7 , 8 ) . Few studies have examined these factors in children with CF. In Stark et al. ( 9 ) parents of CF children undergoing behavioral treatment to increase calorie consumption reported that their children ate slowly and refused a variety of foods and that they attempted to deal with these behaviors through coaxing, criticism, and often giving in to the child's refusal to eat. In a case report of four CF patients Singer et al. ( 1 0 ) reported similar observations of four CF patients and their parents during a hospitalization for failure to thrive.

With persistence of normal blood glucose levels (< 120 fasting, < 180 postprandial) insulin may be reduced or stopped and OHAs used.

With diabetes we are usually interested in achieving weight loss or preventing excess weight gain, while in CF management we are frequently working for weight gain. In diabetes, insulin i s used for glucose control, while in CF insulin is being used for glucose control and anabolic hormone. The diet recommendation for diabetes emphasize a low fat, low simple sugar diet as opposed to the diet for CF which often works toward increasing fat and allowing or encouraging ad-lib simple sugars in the diet as a way to promote weight gain. The diabetes diet encourages establishing a routine and tightly scheduled meal plan while in CF we tend to encourage an \"eat frequently, when you have time and/or are hungry\" meal plan. The approach to diabetes management over the last decade has been one of adding increasing complexity to day-to-day living schedules (frequent glucose testing, multiple insulin injections, strict meal planning, scheduled exercise) to reduce the potential for diabetes-related complications while the already very complex lifestyle o f the CF patient suggests every effort should be made to simplify all elements of the therapy. The philosophy of diabetes management has been to \"look ahead\" and maintain strict glucose control to prevent long-term complications. The more limited longevity of CF patients tends to suggest that in respect to the non-fatal medical problems, attention to more immediate goals with corresponding less concern for 20to 30-year complications might be a better approach. This would be particularly impor-tant if adding additional therapies for diabetes that might decrease attention to pulmonary care programs.",

Experience shows that CF patients can have nothing more than an occasional abnormally elevated serum glucose to frank symptomatic diabetes. The various presentations are most likely a consequence and interaction of the size of the individuals' pancreatic beta cell population and the presence or absence of metabolic stress factors that will affect tissue insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose output and adjunctive therapies (prednisone, i.v., hyperalimentation, etc.) . In the most mild situations we might see elevations in the serum glucose values only at times of significant illness or stress. Such stress-associated glucose intolerance could be due to any one or combination of factors. The most common of these would include: 1) physiological delay in insulin release after a prolonged period of decreased caloric intake, 2) mild reduction in functional beta cell number and/or responsiveness, 3 ) insulin resistance from infection and stress associated increases in cortisol and catecholamine release, 4 ) prednisone therapy, 5) i.v. hyperalimentation with high concentrations of glucose, and 6 ) nocturnal enteral feedings. A more significant reduction in functional beta cell number and/or responsiveness would lead to persistent glucose intolerance. Diabetes would be the expected eventual outcome of a further loss of beta cell reserve. In addition, a certain number of individuals with CF would be expected by chance alone to develop ketotic prone type 1 DM or type 2 DM. The family history, the presence of absence of elevated insulin levels or islet cell antibodies may be of value in differentiating these types of CFRDM. that such information would alter the therapy, such information may be of value for research purposes.",

However, we should also consider non-traditional insulin and schedules (i.e., regular insulin only before each meal or ultralente humulin with regular before each meal). In order to accommodate the frequent meals and increase size of the meal, it is important to help the patient learn how to make small and large changes inn their insulin dose to account for these diet changes.

Tight glucose control without hypoglycemia is important but not at the expense of weight loss or decreased weight gain because of a difficult meal schedule and/or decreased palatability of the diet. Meal planning should continue to be based upon the nutritional requirements and practice needed for children with CF. Diet modifications would include more regularly scheduled meals, more consistency in meal size and composition and elimination of snacks with a high simple sugar content as primary source of calories. Moderate amounts of such items could still be allowed into the regular meal as a desert if given on a routine basis such that the caloric load could be offset by an appropriate adjustment in the insulin dose. Including the desert in each meal should allow for sufficient consistency that the one and two hour post-meal glucose checks can be used to determine how well the insulin is matched to the calories. Including these simple sugar items at the end of the meal would allow additional time for the regular portion of the insulin dose given 20 minutes prior to the meal to be absorbed and be available to handle the glucose load.

Much like the investigation of the biological aspects of disease, psychosocial research aims to make the lives of patients and their families better. This may include extension of life or improvement of the quality of life. Research may be directly useful in patient care or it may be indirectly useful by expanding our knowledge base in an area.Psychosocial research can provide guidance as to areas of potential problems in patient care and can improve efficiency or cost-effectiveness of treatment. Psychosocial research should be an integral part of the evaluation of the effects of medical interventions. The quality of life that results from a treatment is at least as important to most patients as is longevity .",

Using biochemical, molecular and genetic approaches we have determined that the genome of this organism carries two genes encoding PLC activity. One gene encodes a hemolytic PLC (PLC-H) while the other encodes a nonhemolytic PLC (PLC-N). PLC-H and PLC-N share significant amino acid homology, particularly in their amino terminal regions. Both enzymes hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine, a major constituent of lung surfactant, however each enzyme has different specificities for other phospholipids. PLC-H can hydrolyze sphingomyelin while PLC-N is not active on this phospholipid. In contrast to PLC-H, PLC-N hydrolyzes phosphatidylserine.",

Based on Eisenrnan's equilibrium theory of ionic selectivity (9, 10) , the anion permeability sequence, Br-> C1-> I-> F-, suggests that CFTR forms a pore with a moderately high affinity site for anions. Our data suggest that lysine 95 and lysine 335 form at least a part of that site; when the cationic side chains of these amino acids are replaced with anionic residues, the selectivity sequence changes to that of a low affinity site:I-> Br-> C1-> F-.

The expression of the gene encoding pilin, the structural subunit of pili, is controlled by a complex regulatory network. The overall model of regulation of pilin gene expression invokes multiple interactions between positive and negative transcriptional factors. Furthermore, the newly synthesized pilin undergoes posttranslational modifications before its secretion and assembly into a functional adhesin on the bacterial surface.The alternative sigma subunit of RNA polymerase RpoN (054) is responsible for transcription of the pilin gene, as well as a number of genes encoding metabolic functions and motility (2, 3) . This sigma factor has been shown to specifically control the transcription of the pilin subunit gene and not the genes encoding the various secretion and assembly functions (4), because expression of the pilin gene under a strong E. coli promoter resulted in formation of functional pili, even in a P. aemginosa mutant with a defective rpoN gene.Sequence analysis of the clone containing the rpoN gene revealed the presence of two coding sequences for proteins that have been previously implicated in negative modulation of RpoN activity (5) .Transposon Tn5 was used to obtain a library of mutagenized P. aemginosa, and they were used to identify mutants which are unable to transcribe the pilin gene. Two different mutants were isolated. Using a radiolabeled probe derived from sequences flanking the transposon insertion, cosmids that complement both of the mutants were obtained. Restriction enzyme site mapping of the complementing cosmids revealed that the two genes disrupted by Tn5 are linked. Complete nucleotide sequence of the region showed that these genes encode new P. aeruginosa regulatory elements, however, they share significant homologies with the members of the two-component family of sensory and regulatory proteins (6). A product of one of the pilin regulatory genes, called PilR, is similar to prokaryotic transcriptional activators, such as OmpR, NtrC, DctD. The adjacent gene, pits, encodes a homologue of a group of signal sensors, which includes EnvZ, NtrB and DctB.The conserved amino acids in each of the pilin regulatory gene clusters suggests a model for transcriptional control of pilin gene expression involving a phosphorelay mechanism (7) . PilS very likely is autophosphorylated at a histidine residue near its carboxy terminus, and then transfers the phosphate onto an aspartic acid residue near the amino terminus of PilR. Phosphorylated PilR then binds near the pilin gene promoter and plays a role in transcriptional initiation by the $4 containing RNA polymerase.",

The use of oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of these children as an alternative mode of therapy that would avoid hospitalization seemed to be justified.The present study describes our experience in treating children with oral ciprofloxacin for pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis.Twenty-eight children with cystic fibrosis suffering from an acute infectious pulmonary exacerbation were enrolled in this study. Fourteen of these patients received two or more therapeutic courses of ciprofloxacin for a total of 46 courses. The mean age was 10.2 years (range 2-5-17), and they were categorized as moderately to severely ill according to the clinic scoring systems of Shwachman and Kulczyk (1958) and Taussig et al. (1973) and by the x-ray scoring of Brasfield et al. (1979) . Twelve of the patients were between 2 and 10 years of age.All patients were evaluated clinically at the time of enrollment in this study and subsequently at least weekly for the duration of treatment with ciprofloxacin.At least once a week, the following laboratory tests were obtained: complete blood cell count; serum electrolytes; blood urea nitrogen; and glucose; serum creatinine; liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT), and urinalysis. Chest roentgenogram studies were obtained at least at the beginning and end of each therapeutic course. During the past year, a determination of creatinine clearance was obtained at least once in twenty four of the twenty eight patients that had been treated since 1985.A diagnosis of acute pulmonary exacerbation was indicated by the presence of four or more of the following clinical parameters: fever >37.7OC: change in appearance, volume, or color of sputum; increased respiratory rate or dyspnea; progressive physical findings on chest roentgenogram; deterioration of pulmonary function tests; and decreased appetite and weight loss. Bacteriological cultures of the sputum were obtained before initiation of therapy by the second or third week of therapy, and after completion of the therapeutic course. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from all the patients except for one in whom P. cepacia was also isolated.Initial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was determined for all clinical isolates by the standardized Bauer-Kirby disk method using a 5 pg ciprofloxacin disk (NCCLS, 1984) . MICs were subsequently performed on 59 isolates by using the standardized broth dilutions method containing double-fold increasing concentrations of antibiotic (NCCLS, 1987) . Susceptibility t o other antimicrobics was determined by a commercial MIC system (SCEPTOR, BBL Microbiology Systems, Towson, MD). Serum concentration of ciprofloxacin was determined by a gas chromatographic method.Ciprofloxacin was administered orally at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day in two equally divided doses (dose range 38.3-45.1 mg/kg/day).Mean duration of a therapeutic course was 30.5 days (range, 21-76 days).During the first therapeutic course, the median pretreatment MIC of the strains of P. aeruginosa was 0.03 pg/ml ( 19 isolates) . The median MIC at the end of therapy had increased to 0.13 pg/ml (20 isolates). In subsequent therapeutic courses, the pretreatment MIC median value was 0.06 pg/ml (17 isolates).",

            "text": "Following treatment, the median MIC value increased to 2.0 pg/ml (16 isolates). Of these, eight isolates had an MIC of 12.0 pg/ml. A strain of P. cepacia isolated from one patient had an MIC of 2 2 . 0 pg/ml. In all but two patients, the resistance exhibited by the isolates of P. aeruginosa was transient. Follow-up cultures obtained at least 2 months after completion of therapy yield strains of P. aeruginosa with MICs of less than 1.0 pg/ml.The mean peak serum concentration at 2 hours after a dose of ciprofloxacin was 3.24 pg/ml (n=29), with a range of 1.07-5.67 pg/ml ( Table 1) .The results noted at the end of the 46 therapeutic courses were as follows: Most of the 28 patients improved and returned to their pretherapy state of health after completion of their first course of ciprofloxacin therapy.Clinical response to subsequent therapeutic courses has been less dramatic, although significant clinical improvement was noticed in all patients.Bacteriologic eradicationof P. aeruginosa fromthe sputumcultures was not achieved in any of the patients.Adverse side effects attributable to the antibiotic were as follows: Two children complained of slight diarrhea, and one patient experienced abdominal pains. A skin rash developed in one patient after exposure to sunlight. One adolescent female patient, who had a previous history of intermittent arthralgia, complained of joint pain while on therapy.In an eleven year old boy ciprofloxacin had to be discontinued due to a marked skin allergic reaction that subsided within two days after discontinuation of the antibiotic and administration of an oral antihistaminic. Roentgenograms of her ankles and knee joints revealed no degenerative changes or any other abnormalities, and the joint pain disappeared promptly after cessation of therapy with ciprofloxacin. Roentgenograms of the knees and ankles were obtained in nine of the younger patients, even though they did not have any signs or symptoms of bone or joint disease. No abnormalities were detected in these studies. Likewise, no clinical or laboratory abnormalities indicative of hematologic, liver, or kidney abnormalities were noted.The creatinine clearance determination was found to be within normal limits in all twenty-four patients tested.Oral ciprofloxacin appears to be an effective therapy for the treatment of exacerbation of bronchopulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa in child with cystic fibrosis. The results of this trial are similar to those reported with intravenous aminoglycoside and beta-lactam therapy.As with conventional therapy, bacteriologic eradication of P. aeruginosa was not achieved with ciprofloxacin, even though there was clinical resolution of the manifestations of exacerbation of bronchopulmonary infection.Children treated with oral ciprofloxacin experienced clinical improvement by the third to fifth day of therapy and were able to resume their usual activities and continue to attend school. They tolerated the drug very well, and in no instance was it necessary to discontinue ciprofloxacin because of excessive side effects. The most notable side effected occurred in a 16 year old girl, who experienced a moderate degree of arthralgia. This patient had a history of previous idiopathic episodes of arthralgia unrelated to the administration of ciprofloxacin.All symptoms disappeared after the therapeutic course of ciprofloxacin was completed.Roentgenographic studies of the knees and ankles of nine of the patients in this study revealed no abnormalities.Likewise, no signs of symptoms of hematologic, liver or kidney abnormalities were detected in these children.The development of resistant strains of P. aeruginosa during treatment in this study was comparable to that of other studies in the adult population. As in studies reported previously, the presence of resistant strains in the sputum culture of those patients often appeared to be transient.The results of this study suggest that ciprofloxacin can be used safely as alternative therapy in children with cystic fibrosis suffering from bronchopulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. The length of therapy should be similar to that of conventional therapy (usually 2 weeks, and possibly up to 4 weeks).If at all possible, an interval of at least 2 months should elapse before more of the resistant strains have disappeared from the sputum culture. Careful clinical, laboratory and roentgenographic monitoring of potential side effects should be planned for children treated with ciprofloxacin. With improvement in quality of life, longevity and the excitement over potential therapeutic interventions in cystic fibrosis, there is an unbridled optimism for the future of these chronically ill patients. We now have the opportunity to rationally treat patients based on the discovery of the CF gene and its gene product (CFTR) ( Table I ). 1-3 Biochemical interventions seem appropriate with the recent encouraging data on the use of amil~ride.~?' There is also new data on the genetically engineered use of proteases and elastases in improving lung These advances come on the heel of better nutritional supplementation, antibiotic usage and the national trails of corticosteroids and aerosol antibiotics. With all of these potential and real advances it is premature to lump all patients with cystic fibrosis as DNR (Do Not Resuscitate). Additionally, with the successful transplantation of CF patients on mechanical ventilation, as well as the improvement in transplantation in general (Table 21 , there is cause for optimism in treating patients with CF. The use of mechanical ventilation may now have a role in a disease process that has always been typified by DO NOT RESUSCITATE. There is nothing inherent about cystic fibrosis that would prevent a physician from initiating mechanical ventilation in a patient who developed respiratory failure. A recent report of an infant who was ventilated from about three weeks to six months of age with subsequent good results demonstrates that the CF lung is capable of healing1. As was discussed in this forum last year, there still is no medical, social, or ethical justification for beginning heroic and uncomfortable therapy on someone who has no hope of recovering enough to discontinue such treatment2. There recently has been considerable renewal of enthusiasm for the ability to perform lung transplantation on C F patients who have been ventilated for some period of time.Any new procedure which shows promise in the therapy of previously untreatable disease will be hailed with enthusiasm by the medical community. Just as surely, the procedure will be pushed to the limits as soon as possible by physicians who feel in desperate need to do something for their patients. It was inevitable that these caregivers would try to perform lung transplantation on patients who are on ventilators, in spite of poor results from such patients in the early days of this procedure. Reports of successful transplantation of CF patients who were on mechanical ventilation now have come from a number of centers, although most of the successes have had the good fortune to find donor grafts within a few days?. The general tenor of discussion at national meetings now is that it is quite all right to wait until a CF patient goes into respiratory failure, then ship him off to a transplantation center for definitive care, This is not all right! In fact, it is colossally unfair to the patient, the family, and the recipient center. The patient invariably arrives in bad shape, often febrile and poorly nourished. The recipient center has a limited number of choices. They can refuse the patient outright, receive the patient and place him in some sort of administrative limbo until he can be extubated, or utilize a graft that otherwise would have gone to a candidate who was a much better operative risk and who had been waiting patiently for several months for a new chance at life. Carried to the extreme, lung transplant recipients on life support may soon be given a UNOS Category One classification similar to heart recipients, meaning that they will bump all other candidates and receive the first available donor organ. There now is substantial experience at doing partial lung or lobar transplants, so the requirement for a perfect thoracic fit may no longer be so important. The net result of all of this is that an increasing number of grafts will be given to poor candidates, driving up the mortality from the procedure and depriving more suitable candidates of a transplant opportunity. Perhaps more importantly, most of the transportees will not obtain a graft and will therefore die on the ventilator at the new center far away from home and friends and after having incurred tremendous medical and travel expenses.",

            "text": "It gets worse! There now have been at least four patients who have received living donor lung tissue from a close relative. Although these were children, there was at least one instance in which a transplantation center was seriously considering using a lower lobe from each parent for a double lung transplantation for a CF teenager who was on mechanical ventilation (fortunately a cadaver donor was found before this was necessary). There have been a number of inquiries about the possibility of removal of an entire lung for transplantation into an adult relative. It is not too far-fetched to imagine a scenario in which an intubated CF patient arrives by transport with a designated tissue donor relative in tow and expects an almost immediate procedure. The Stanford Institutional Review Board pondered long and hard, then decided to permit the removal of no more than two lobes of a lung for donation4. Surgeons at the University of Chicago have decided to do a living donor transplant operation only in situations where it was not an emergency in order to remove pressure from the parents to donate.Must things inevitably get out of hand? No, not if the basic principles of successful transplantation are followed. Patients who are interested in transplantation should be referred to centers early to receive an evaluation and permit remedial procedures such as sinus surgery and the placement of gastrostomies for weight gains. Families will be able to prepare for the stress of transplantation with the guidance of center counsellors and the assistance of other transplant patients. Adequate screening of patients for potentially serious complications will permit a continued high rate of success for lung transplantation.Most centers now would intubate and ventilate a CF patient who was on their list as an active candidate, at least until that patient became septic or developed multiple organ failure. There is no reason not to ventilate a patient who has a reasonable expectation of being extubated in the near future. On the other hand, mechanical ventilation of a patient with end-stage lung disease who has no realistic hope for a lung transplant is irresponsible medicine.",
