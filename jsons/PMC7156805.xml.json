The authors provided a pertinent overview of infection risk associated with commonly used biologics to treat psoriasis in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. We agree that this time has been particularly concerning for patients taking immunomodulators/immunosuppressants who are unsure of their risk for severe disease.",

However, each medication's mechanism of action, administration method/frequency, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics are important to consider. Nonbiologic medications, including small molecule inhibitors and immunosuppressants, are typically easier to stop and restart within days to weeks due to shorter half-life. Meanwhile, biologics generally have a longer half-life and include a risk of antidrug antibody formation with treatment cessation and subsequent continuation. However, biologics also tend to be more targeted and less involved in the previously mentioned components of the viral immune response. General medication considerations are included in Table I. Although patient dependent, clinicians may consider weaning patients with stable disease off of immunosuppressants.",

(Left) (1) Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 occurs though direct contact with respiratory secretions of infected individuals.2 The virus invades host cells by binding to their receptors and fusing with the cell membrane. (2) It is hypothesized that once inside the body, the lung epithelial cells become the primary target, where the receptor binding domain of the virus spikes bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of ACE2-expressing target cells. (3) Although not confirmed, it is believed the virus dampens the initial type 1 interferon (IFN) responses, which contributes to uncontrolled viral replication. (4) Once the virus is identified, macrophages present viral components to activate and induce (5) differentiation of T cells and B cells. (6) Activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies important for neutralizing viruses. (7) The resulting inflammatory cytokines and antibodies continue to stimulate the production of additional cytokines and antibodies, which may contribute to the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d noted in those with severe disease. (8) The inflammatory cytokines and antibodies also promote the influx of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages along with additional inflammatory cytokines.
