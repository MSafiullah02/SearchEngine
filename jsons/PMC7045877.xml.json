Consequently, the KCDC reformed the system for preparing and responding to infectious diseases caused by patients returning from travel abroad [3]. This has led to the establishment of the Emergency Operations Center. In the aftermath of the MERS outbreak, KCDC has strengthened its risk communication and risk assessment strategy by introducing new divisions in the KCDC, and increasing the number of professional epidemiological investigators [3]. As a result, a MERS case where the patient had traveled abroad, was successfully contained with no further confirmed cases in 2018 [4].",
