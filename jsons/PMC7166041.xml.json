            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of cases of unexplained viral pneumonia was identified in Wuhan, a metropolitan city in Hubei province, China. Initially, most of the confirmed cases were linked with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, where numerous types of live wild animals are sold, including poultry, bats, groundhogs, and snakes. To identify the causative agent of this disease, a large number of tests were conducted, which ruled out several etiological agents that may cause similar symptoms, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), avian influenza virus, and other common respiratory pathogens. Finally, a new coronavirus, putatively named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, was identified as the causative pathogen of this outbreak. On January 20, after a visit to Wuhan, Professor Zhong Nanshan, a SARS intervention specialist, confirmed that 2019-nCoV was spreading between people1, which led to increased vigilance by the Chinese government and people. At 10:00 on January 23, Wuhan, the birthplace of the disease, declared a general closure to prevent its further spread. However, Wuhan is a major transportation hub located in the central region of the People's Republic of China with approximately 11 million inhabitants2, and the period from the end of December 2019 to February 2020 was the time of the \u201cSpring Festival travel rush\u201d. Although the Chinese government made great efforts to control the flow of people, the disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other cities, as well as other countries, likely through asymptomatic carriers3. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, the sixth public health emergency after H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), zika (2016), and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019) 4. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the related pneumonia as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 12, 20205. As the disease is highly infectious, \u201cthe law of the People's Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases\u201d lists it as a class B infectious disease, and recommends preventive and control measures similar to those against class A infectious diseases. The outbreak is ongoing, and poses a great global challenge. Health workers, governments, and the public need to co-operate globally to prevent its further spread.",

Tyrell and Bynoe called them coronaviruses because they are spherical virions with a core shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona7. Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. Members of this subfamily were genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus\n8. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals and usually cause respiratory illness in humans and gastroenteritis in animals. The gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses predominantly infect birds, but some can also infect mammals9. Six types of coronavirus have been identified in humans (HCoVs), including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. The first two belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus and the latter four to the genus Betacoronavirus\n10. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans, while the other four human coronaviruses induce only mild upper respiratory diseases in immunocompetent hosts11\n,\n12. Coronaviruses did not attract worldwide attention until the 2003 SARS epidemic, followed by the 2012 MERS outbreak and, most recently, the novel coronavirus pandemic.",

Full-length genome sequences were obtained and indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 79.6% sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV14. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 infects human lung alveolar epithelial cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis using angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as an entry receptor. Attachment to the receptor mediates the subsequent fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane, thereby allowing viral entry into the host cell15\n,\n16.",

As most of the confirmed cases were linked to direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market17, it was initially believed that the origin of the virus may have been the seafood market. Based on current sequence databases, all human coronaviruses have animal origins: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, their natural reservoir, but were transmitted to humans via intermediate host civets and camels, respectively18. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are also considered to have originated in bats, while HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 likely originated in rodents11\n,\n12. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC2113\n,\n19 and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to bat coronavirus TG137\n,\n14. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may also have originated in bats, and was then transmitted to humans via an intermediate host in the Huanan seafood market. Analysis of the genome of a coronavirus isolated from pangolins indicated that the isolated strains and SARS-CoV-2 are 99% similar. This suggests that pangolins may be potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, and the transmission and evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 may be from bat-CoV to pangolins, and then to humans. However, On February 20, 2020, the website of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences published an article that suggested that the seafood market may not have been the source of COVID-19, and that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced from elsewhere and then spread rapidly in the market. The symptom onset date for the first patient identified was December 1, 2019, and no epidemiological link was found between the patient and later cases17. Based on factors such as the incubation period of the virus, the first new coronavirus infection may have appeared in late November 2019 or even earlier.",

Because of the mild clinical symptoms during the incubation period, patients can remain mobile and carry out routine activities, leading to the spread of infection. Asymptomatic carriers can also be a source of infection25. The incubation period of the disease is 1\u201314 days, usually 3\u20137 days, and can even reach 24 days, making it difficult to screen for infections. Additionally, the disease is mainly spread by respiratory droplets and contact.

As of February 12, 2020, a total of 3,019 health workers had been infected, and accounted for 3.83% of the total number of infections27. Personal protective equipment (PPE), including fluid-resistant gown, gloves, eye protection, full face shield, and fit-tested N95 respirators, is necessary to maximize the safety of healthcare workers who need to be in contact with critically ill patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection28. A recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of new coronavirus pneumonia patients with conjunctivitis29, which suggests that ocular infection may be a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The possibility of fecal\u2013oral transmission also needs to be considered, as viral nucleic acids have been found in fecal samples and anal swabs from some COVID-19-infected patients30. On February 5, 2020, multiple media outlets also reported that a newborn infant delivered by a woman who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic in Wuhan had also tested positive for the virus 30 hours following his/her birth2. There is currently no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can undergo intrauterine or transplacental transmission31\n,\n32; however, when delivering a neonate from an infected patient or a person suspected of being infected, neonatologists should wear suitable protective equipment. Moreover, the newborns must be isolated as soon as they are suspected of being infected.",

SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe illness and death primarily in older people, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease34, possibly due to a weakened immune system that permits a faster progression of viral infection.

The mortality rate among pregnant women due to respiratory pathogens is substantially higher than that among ordinary people; for example, the 1918 influenza pandemic resulted in a mortality rate of 2.6% for the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women38. Therefore, pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be cared for in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. In this regard, experiences with illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, may also be relevant to SARS-CoV-2, including early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric antibiotics, and fetal and uterine contraction monitoring39.",

The reproduction number, R, is used to reflect the transmissibility of a virus, and represents the average number of new infections generated by each infected person, the initial constant of which is called the basic reproduction number, R0: the larger the R0 is, the stronger the transmission potential of the virus41. An R-value  >1 indicates that the outbreak will be self-sustaining unless effective control measures are implemented, while an R-value  <1 indicates that the number of new cases will decrease over time and the outbreak will eventually stop42. Compared with the R0 of H1N1 (1.25) 43 and that of SARS (2.2\u20133.6) 44, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated as 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) 2, 3.11 (95% CI, 2.39\u20134.13) 45, and 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47\u20132.86) 46 by different groups and is significantly larger than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmissibility potential and consequently the ability to cause outbreaks. It may be very difficult to contain or control the spread of this virus without adequate prevention and control measures. The effective reproduction number (Rt) quantifies the number of infections caused by each new case occurring at time t. It is typically lower than that of R0 owing to the effect of control measures in reducing transmission, and the depletion of susceptible individuals during the epidemic; epidemic decay is guaranteed only where Rt is maintained below 147.",

Based on previous studies and the experience gained from the SARS epidemic, Wang et al. applied this model to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China.

Judging from the dwindling number of newly diagnosed cases in China (Fig. 1\n), the prevention and control measures implemented were indeed effective.

In addition, a few COVID-19 patients also showed gastrointestinal symptoms30, i.e., diarrhea (3.8%) and vomiting (5.0%)33. Although studies have indicated that fever is the dominant symptom (Table 1\n), some severely or critically ill patients may have moderate, low, or even no significant fever50\n,\n51. Therefore, undue emphasis should not be placed on a patient's body temperature for disease evaluation in clinical treatment and daily screening. Most patients have a good prognosis, while a few are in a critical condition, especially the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions such as cardiac disease and diabetes52. Sepsis is the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart failure, and septic shock53.",

Studies have shown that CT has a low rate of missed COVID-19 diagnosis (3.9%, 2/51) 58 and the sensitivity of chest CT was greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs. 71%, respectively, p < 0.001) 59, indicating that CT may be useful as a standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

However, this diagnostic method has several shortcomings, such as a low detection rate and high false-negative rates. Moreover, this method is suitable only for diagnosis, and cannot be used to judge the severity and progression of the disease. Additionally, the supply cannot keep up with the demand, and it takes one day or more to obtain results, which may be detrimental to the timely treatment of patients63. The Chinese health authorities have issued the 5th version of the diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-1964. According to the updated criteria, suspected cases with imaging characteristics of pneumonia can be clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 in Hubei province. In this way, patients can receive standardized treatment as soon as possible, so as to further improve the success rate of treatment and contain the spread of the epidemic. Recently, Li et al. developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can simultaneously detect IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human blood within 15 minutes. This rapid test has great potential benefit for the fast screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections to prevent virus transmission and assure the timely treatment of patients65.",

            "text": "Identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. Current guidelines26 recommend IFN-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate, and arbidol as antiviral therapies. IFN-alpha is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that can inhibit the replication of animal and human coronaviruses71\n,\n72, while lopinavir is a proteinase inhibitor used to treat HIV infection, with ritonavir being used as a booster73\n,\n74. In Korea, the viral load of one patient was reduced and clinical symptoms improved with combined administration of lopinavir and ritonavir75. However, a randomized, controlled, open-label trial in China found that lopinavir/ritonavir cotreatment did not significantly enhance clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in seriously ill COVID-19 patients76. The efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 requires further clinical confirmation. Ribavirin, a synthetic guanosine analog and broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, is frequently used for the treatment of SARS and MERS patients77\n,\n78. Morgenstern et al. 79 reported that, compared with single treatment, a combination of ribavirin and IFN-beta inhibited SARS-CoV replication when administered at greatly reduced concentrations. However, the use of ribavirin is associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis and reduced hemoglobin levels80, indicating that ribavirin should be used with caution as a treatment for COVID-19. Multicenter clinical trials conducted in China indicated that chloroquine phosphate, widely used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases81\n,\n82, may have some efficacy against COVID-19 associated pneumonia, with acceptable safety83, 84, 85. Arbidol, a Russian-made small indole-derivative molecule, is used for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections86\n,\n87. Deng et al. 88 found that arbidol combined with lopinavir/ritonavir might delay the progression of lung lesions and reduce the viral load in COVID-19 patients. Nearly all the above-mentioned drug options are associated with the treatment of SARS, MERS, or other new influenza viruses and additional randomized, prospective studies are still needed to determine their efficacy against COVID-19.",

Since then, many other cities have also begun to regulate traffic117. Transportation quarantine has been comprehensively strengthened in passenger stations and other public places, and temperature tests have been carried out to screen for potential cases of COVID-19. In addition, strict monitoring measures have been put in place in various regions for returnees, especially those returning from Hubei province or with suspected exposure to the infection. The Chinese government has also employed numerous other coercive measures to limit population mobility, such as canceling public gatherings, closing schools, encouraging remote work, and extending the Chinese Spring Festival holidays23. The Chinese government attached great importance to the COVID-19 outbreak and invested a large amount of manpower and funds for the purchase of medical equipment, drugs, and protective equipment, and fully implement medical treatment118.

Wearing masks as a public health intervention may also help break the transmission link with apparently healthy infectious sources123, 124, 125. At present, for the public, the most direct and effective way to prevent the spread of the disease is to take protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing a medical mask, having enough rest, maintaining ventilation, and avoiding crowds.",

According to the WHO, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak, 774 of whom died. After the SARS outbreak, MERS became the second coronavirus to cause a serious global public health crisis. From 2012 to 2018, the WHO recorded 2,220 laboratory-confirmed cases, resulting in at least 790 deaths126. According to the current statistics, the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths far exceeds that of SARS and MERS and is still increasing. The reservoir host of the 2003 SARS virus was thought to be the Asian civet (Paguma larvata). The focal point of host-to-human transmission was thought to be the live animal market in Guangdong province in China, much like the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak127. The COVID-19 outbreak is another reminder of the ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans. While it is unclear whether the Huanan seafood market is the source of the current outbreak, a total ban on the illegal wildlife trade is imminent.",
