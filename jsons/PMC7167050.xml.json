            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates of Swedish children with lower respiratory tract infection [Allander et al., 2005]. Respiratory infection with HBoV occurs worldwide with frequencies ranging from 1.5% to 19.3% in respiratory samples of children [Bastien et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Neske et al., 2007; Bonzel et al., 2008; Brieu et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008; Albuquerque et al., 2009; Fabbiani et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2010; Kaida et al., 2010; Moriyama et al., 2010; Midulla et al., 2010; Miron et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010]. HBoV was also detected in stool specimens of children admitted to hospital for acute gastroenteritis [Albuquerque et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Chieochansin et al., 2008; Kapoor et al., 2009, 2010; Szomor et al., 2009; Chow et al., 2010]. Infections are known in children and adults, but children younger than 2 years appear to be most at risk of HBoV infection. HBoV was found recently in children with lower respiratory tract infection, and several studies show an association between HBoV and acute respiratory symptoms, which is consistent with a causal role [Allander et al., 2005; Kesebir et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007; Maggi et al., 2007]. Most studies confirmed a high rate of coinfections, where HBoV occurs simultaneously with other respiratory viruses, thereby making the association of HBoV with disease more complex [Allander, 2008; Schildgen et al., 2008]. There are also a few reports of the persistence of HBoV DNA in respiratory and blood samples, or prolonged shedding of HBoV in infected patients [Allander et al., 2007; von Linstow et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2010].",

Interestingly, the highest HBoV infection rate was found in children aged between 13 and 24 months. This finding agrees with previous reports, which indicate that the median age of HBoV\u2010infected children is between 13 and 18 months [Foulongne et al., 2006; Volz et al., 2007; Bharaj et al., 2010; Calvo et al., 2010; Garcia\u2010Garcia et al., 2010; Miron et al., 2010; Moriyama et al., 2010].

However, the median level of viral loads appeared to be significantly higher in patients with a single HBoV infection than in patients coinfected with other respiratory viruses (P = 0.005). These findings corroborate the results of two other previous studies [Allander et al., 2007; Brieu et al., 2008]. Allander et al. [2007] suggested that high HBoV DNA loads are indicative of a causative role of HBoV in respiratory tract infections, whereas low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding. In the present study the age of the children (12\u201324 months) and wheezing were associated with high HBoV DNA load.",

Patients with RSV and hMPV were hospitalized longer and needed longer oxygen therapy, but the differences were not statistically significant. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and recurrent wheezing were the most common clinical presentations of single bocavirus infections. These data agree with other published studies where these clinical presentations were detected commonly in HBoV\u2010infected patients. Direct comparison with other studies is difficult, because the inclusion criteria in different studies vary widely, ranging among patients suffering from acute bronchiolitis, recurrent wheezing, or unspecified respiratory tract infections.",

Second, the prevalence of viruses detected by DFA testing (i.e., Flu A/B) might indicate an underestimation of the true prevalence, because of the low sensitivity of the DFA method when compared with PCR. However, the sensitivity of DFA in RSV detection was determined in other studies (unpublished data) and did not differ to any great extent [Kuypers et al., 2006; Aslanzadeh et al., 2008]. While HBoV shedding is very frequent, the true seasonality of symptomatic primary HBoV infection is difficult to study by this approach, although we found a clear seasonal distribution of infections caused by HBoV. Finally, a control group of children of the same age would be desirable. Thus, a new prospective study was commenced at the University Medical Centre in 2009, where an age\u2010matched control group of patients was included.",
