            "text": "Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently affects nearly one-third of the world's population [1]. Highly contagious pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) can masquerade as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and escape initial diagnosis by emergency room (ER) physicians, thereby increasing the risk of nosocomial infection and further transmission to the general population [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Current screening methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) involve respiratory isolation (RI) of suspected PTB patients until 3 sputum samples obtained over 48 h are negative [6]. This expanded RI policy for all patients suspected of PTB in the United States led to the proper isolation of over 95% of PTB upon admission; however, it also resulted in an 8-fold overuse of the isolation room, and eventually led to an insufficient number of isolation rooms [7]. Under the threatening of acute lung disease such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the new H1N1 influenza nowadays, a 3-day isolation policy for waiting times for smear results for all patients merely suspected of active PTB, may prove too burdensome for most hospitals [8], [9]. Furthermore, an isolation policy based solely upon negative sputum samples may not adequately account for the truly positive sputums missed due to low organism loads [10]. Therefore, more effective diagnostic tests and/or criteria for differentiating those patients at highest risk of active PTB are desperately needed.",

CAP was defined as the presence of an acute illness of 21 days or less duration with (1) one or more symptoms such as fever >38.5, confusion, sweating aches, etc., (2) at least two or more of new or increasing cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, wheeze, new focal or diffuse signs on physical examinations, (3) CXR consistent with infection and which was neither pre-existing nor of other known cause and (4) treatment with antibiotics for pneumonia by the pulmonologists or infection clinicians [16]. Patients were treated by the ER physician, followed by either a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist.

Images were acquired during a single breath-hold 5\u20138 s long, making respiratory motion artifacts very uncommon. The images were reconstructed with a 1-mm slice thickness in the axial plane (no gap) and in the coronal plane (5-mm apart) using a high spatial-frequency algorithm, and then sent to PACS for review. All thin-section MDCT images were displayed on a monitor at the pulmonary window level setting (level, \u2212600 HU; width, 1200 HU).",
