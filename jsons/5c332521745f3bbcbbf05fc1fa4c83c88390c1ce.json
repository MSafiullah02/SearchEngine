Patients received HFNT or intubation, but non-invasive mechanical ventilation was not applied. Two weeks after ICU admission, three out of ten intubated patients have died, and half of the patient cohort required prolonged ventilatory support. Two out of ten intubated patients were extubated (and discharged), most at the second week of ventilation. Plasma procalcitonin (threshold 0.5\u00b5g/L) failed to predict mortality. Our findings suggest that an oxygenation strategy emphasising optimisation of oxygenation, intubation based on clinical criteria of hyperventilation and avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury associated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation would be life-saving in a significant proportion of patients. Table 1 compares current findings with first series of SARS-CoV2 in the ICU in China, USA, and 2009 pandemic influenza in Spain. Clinical presentation is consistent with a recent systematic review [9] , lymphocytopenia and coagulation alterations being common at hospital admission, with some important differences documented when compared with pandemic influenza in 2009 (Table 1) , as reported elsewhere [2] , and also with the first ICU series reported from Wuhan [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1082, "end": 1085, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1294, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1356, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 885, "end": 892, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1266, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Obesity was the most common comorbidity in our report, suggesting differences in western countries regarding Wuhan reports (11), followed by hypertension and chronic respiratory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diseases. The low prevalence of immunocompromised (solid organ transplants or HIV) and pregnant patients compared with severe influenza-infected patients may be associated with the interaction of coronavirus with innate immunity. Fei Zhou et al. [5] reported a risk of death above 90% in patients with high procalcitonin, which is not consistent with our findings. This can be due to different laboratory techniques, co-infection rates or degree of acute lung injury (no NIV was applied in our cohort). Although more information on procalcitonin is required [12] , our findings suggest that no prognostic information can be inferred. This early report of characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 influenza in Spain is of interest, as most information currently available is coming from large cohorts in China, or short case series from Italy or USA (5, 6, 11, 13) . An important characteristic is that in the current cohort, no patients were exposed to prior non-invasive ventilation, which was commonly performed using a facial mask in Wuhan or a helmet in Italy, with a protocol of earlier intubation based on hyperventilation unable to maintain Satv02 above 90%. Patients in this cohort were intubated a median of 7 days after onset, which is later than in pandemic influenza but earlier than in 15 to 19) days. Although 28-day mortality was not available due to the early report, 7day mortality was estimated to be lower than 15% in our cohort and 10 patients were extubated within the second week, which means that the prognosis is better with different strategies of oxygenation. In contrast with reports from China or Seattle suggesting a severe ARDS, a strategy of early intubation disclosed that SARS-CoV-2 does not lead to a typical ARDS. In our experience, two thirds of our patients have initial lung compliance > 40 ml/cm H20 postintubation being consistent with a preliminary report with 16 patients by Gattinoni et al. (6) , suggesting that ARDS is a consequence of acute lung injury associated with delayed intubation or super-infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 455, "end": 458, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 767, "end": 771, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1053, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1057, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1061, "text": "13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2135, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1497, "end": 1506, "text": "15 to 19)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Thus, non-invasive ventilation seems not recommended and early high PEEP (above 10 cm H20 is probably not the right ventilatory strategy) may be harmful. Our experience suggests avoiding spontaneous ventilation early in the ED or ward may be harmful. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 patients can be maintained with high-flow oxygen nasal therapy (HFNT) or high-concentration oxygen reservoir if they do not present extreme hyperventilation. Early on this disease, non-intubated patients may benefit from prone position before intubation. Three of our patients were managed like this without intubation and were discharged early. Recruitment manoeuvres should be contraindicated and the benefit of prone position in intubated patients and protective ventilation should be restricted to those developing acute lung injury. These findings suggest that hypoxemic vasoconstriction is the main early mechanism and patients can benefit of inhaled prostacyclin or nitric oxide (before developing tachyphylaxis).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Lastly, although we did not document pulmonary embolisms in our cohort (autopsies were not allowed), laboratory tests are consistent with endothelial injury and micro-thrombosis. Zhou et al. (5) reported serum ferritin with a median above 1400 ng/L among 54 non-survivors in a context of hyperinflammatory states. These patients should receive sCD25 measurements and a bone marrow aspirate to rule out systemic haemophagocytic lymphocytosis, which should be treated with 500 mg/kg gamma globulins/day and dexamethasone 10 mg/12 h for 4 days.

However, it is an early report illustrative of the epidemiology in South Europe, which can be compared with Wuhan and initial reports of pandemic influenza A H1N1pdm 2009 in Spain (table 1). We already expanded the ICU capacity above two-fold in March 18 th and data cannot be generalisable to patients with another acceleration phase or with different available resources, but may serve to develop contingency plans in other geographical regions. Procalcitonin technique of determination may influence values and data may not be comparable when using other methods, such as KRIPTOR\u00ae to determine plasma values.
