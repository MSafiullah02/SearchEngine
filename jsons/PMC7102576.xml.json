By January 30, 2020, the cumulative number of 2019-nCoV cases in China had exceeded the total number of previous SARS cases worldwide [29], and many new cases appeared in only one month. Currently, there are still more than 3000 new confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection daily. As of the date of this publication, the total number of confirmed domestic cases has risen to 78064 [30]. During this period, the diagnosis, isolation, admission and treatment of patients have become the biggest challenges that China and the international community need to face. It is reassuring that the vast majority of cases of 2019-nCOV are still concentrated in China, and the number of transmitting countries and regions is currently 28 (Fig. 1B), slightly lower than the number of countries that reported SARS cases [12,31]. In addition, no deaths have been reported in any country outside of China, except for the death of a pneumonia patient in the Philippines [32] (as of February 9, 2020). Since 2019-nCOV has an incubation period of 5.3\u201319 days (average of 5.2 days) [33], the effects of international traffic control measures in 2020 need to be further observed.",

Huoshenshan Hospital was successfully constructed at an astonishing speed, and started to receive patients within ten days [25]. On January 26, the Chinese government invested 11.21 billion RMB; after 11 days [34], the investment increased to 66.74 billion RMB [35] in epidemic prevention and control funds, and has deployed more than 10,000 medical staff nationwide to assist Hubei Province [27]. Back in 2003, China built the Xiaotangshan Temporary Hospital in 6 days [36], with its construction starting as late as 158 days after the first case was reported, indicating that the response to the spread of SARS-CoV was far slower than for 2019-nCoV. Similarly, in the current epidemic, China implemented main domestic response measures before WHO\u2019s announcement of the high risk of a global epidemic; while during SARS, China\u2019s establishment of temporary hospitals and financial support came after WHO\u2019s warning.",

In particular, it should be noted that on January 24, 2020, Hubei Province launched the most stringent anti-epidemic traffic control measures in human history, as measured in the number of human individuals affected. Among them, at 9 pm on January 23, Wuhan first launched traffic control [47]. On the second day, other cities in Hubei have also announced measures for epidemic prevention traffic control [48], and rail, high-speed and ordinary road traffic within the jurisdiction of the above-mentioned cities have been suspended to varying degrees, and public transportation such as buses and long-distance passenger transport within the jurisdiction of the city have also been suspended. The control measures appeared to take effect within two days: the case increase rate in other provinces across the country began to be significantly slower than the case increase rate in Hubei Province, as shown in Fig. 2\n. Compared with the case number in Hubei Province, the increase in case numbers in other provinces became significantly slower (p = 0.0001).",

Comparing domestic air passenger traffic data in 2002 and 2018 (the normal passenger traffic in the year before the current outbreak), the national passenger volume in 2018 was 7 times larger than in 2002 [49,50].

In addition, despite the unpredictability of each epidemic, the process of battling previous epidemics has brought with it valuable experience for responding to future epidemics. The 2019-nCOV epidemic has challenged the limits of our ability to handle it. As a viral infectious disease that can be transmitted through multiple channels, its onset time also coincided with the Spring Festival (the biggest national holiday in China), when over a billion people begin their annual migration in China. The outbreak also originated in the main traffic hub in China, Wuhan, where both resident and floating populations are dense.",

As shown in Fig. 3\n, during a public health emergency, the smooth coordination between the government, medical care and the masses is very important. For example, on February 3, when the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan had reached 6384 [52] and there was a shortage of medical resources, the government promptly claimed stadiums, exhibition halls and other places to establish a number of \u201csquare cabin hospitals\u201d for treating non-critical patients. This was done to free up important resources at Huoshenshan Hospital, Leishenshan Hospital and other sites to treat critically ill patients in a more timely manner [53].

In 2003, television and other media were the main communication channels for epidemic prevention information. In 2019, however, real-time information of the 2019-nCOV epidemic was transmitted in real-time through various channels throughout the country, like WeChat and Weibo like apps.
