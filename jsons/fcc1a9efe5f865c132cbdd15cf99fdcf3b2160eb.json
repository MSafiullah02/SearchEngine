Delay in ICU admission has been identified as a reason for discrepancies between real and expected deaths of ICU patients (\"lead time bias\")1. Nevertheless, no one of the available systems for predicting risk of death includes systematically this variable, except for EPEC2. Our aim has been to assess the influence on outcome of the time delay detection of EPEC METHODS. During six months of 2003, EPEC has been used for outcome prediction assesment in all consecutive admissions to our 19 beds ICU. Simultaneously, predictions by means of MPM II 0, SAPS 2 and socio demographic data were also collected. Mortality was considered during hospital stay. Time delay, in EPEC, is defined as the delay in real admission of the patient in ICU, once the ICU physician has notice of his situation, no matter where the patient was before (ED, wards, RR, OR). That means that real delay (no detected risk situation) was not captured by the system.",

Aggregation of 2 consecutive prospective randomised placebo controlled supplementation trials delivering Cu 59 \u00b5mol, Se 4.8 \u00b5mol (370 mg), Zn 574 \u00b5mol IV per day (group TE) or vehicle (group V) for 8 to 21 days depending on surface burned.

Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a severe pathological condition and is associated with high mortality. It is known that reperfusion of ischemic tissue causes damage of the DNA, which leads to the activation of Poly-(ADP-Ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) (1). PARP repairs damaged DNA in energy-consuming steps, which might lead to cellular energy-depletion and cell death. In our experiments we inhibited the enzyme PARP with the PARP-Inhibitor 5-AIQ in HS prior to reperfusion and investigated the impact of PARP-inhibition on the microcirculation of the rat liver.",

GM-CSF plasma levels increased following treatment and remained elevated in the verum group. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL 6 and PCT) had comparable baselines, but increased to higher values in the verum group. TNF plasma levels increased during the first days in the verum group compared to the placebo group. IL 10 plasma levels were persistently higher in the verum group. Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines or GM-CSF did not correlate with outcome. In nonsurviving patients IL 10 plasma levels were elevated during the first week when compared to survivors and decreased constantly over the last treatment week. Nonsurvivors of the verum group showed consistently higher IL 10 levels than the rest of the population.",

Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) is widely used in the management of patients with severe sepsis and acute renal failure. Nevertheless, short filter lifespan (< 24 hours) is still a major concern, and could be the result of a procoagulating state secondary to sepsis. The aim of this work is to study the possible relationship between antithrombine (AT) deficit and early filter's clotting, and also if supplementation of AT could increase the filter lifespan. We did also compare two different methods for supplementation : Bolus versus Continuous Infusion.",

Patients treated with a continuous infusion method had a level of AT above 60 % a longer period of time when compared with the bolus method, and obviously their filter lifespan increased further from 27,8 (bolus) to 48,5 hours. The loglinear regression with frailty is statistically significant and show a high correlation between filter lifespan logarithm and AT activity level (p<0,001).CONCLUSION. This study show that a level of AT under 60% increase the risk of early filter clotting and the filter lifespan is clearly correlated with the AT activity level. A supplementation of AT could increase the filter lifespan by more than 100%. The continuous infusion is a better method to maintain a level of AT above 60% and can increase more significantly the filter lifespan. Costeffectiveness should be evaluated shortly.",

Global mortality was 54.3% (57.7% stable vs 52.9% unstable, p ns). 42 patients (44.7%) were classified as Rs and 52 (55.3%) as NRs. Excluding mortality no differences were detected between these groups in any of the variables studied: RS 51.9\u00b112.6 years, APACHE II at CRRT initiation 21.6\u00b14.9, organs failing 3.8\u00b11.2, dose of CRRT 2.5\u00b10.5 L/h and NRs 55.8\u00b114.5 years, APACHE II at CRRT 22.5\u00b16.3, organs failing 3.7\u00b11.4, dose 2.35\u00b10.5 L/h. Rs mortality was 28.6% vs 75% in NRs (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis: age (OR 1.05, p<0.05), APACHE II at CRRT initiation (OR 1.14, p<0.05), number of organs failing at initiation (OR 1.98, p<0.05) and NRs (OR 11.54, p<0.001) were related to mortality. Selecting only patients unstable (N 68), Rs mortality was 23.7% (9 out of 38) vs 97% (27 out of 30) in NRs. Logistic regression analysis: APACHE II at CRRT (OR 1.18, p<0.05) and NRs (OR 26.5, p<0 .001) only variables related to mortality CONCLUSION. Early hemodynamic improvement after CRRT is closely related to survival and this relationship is ever stronger when considering unstable patients . This response is a better predictor of survival than APACHE II or number of failing organs",

SPAD employs standard haemodiafiltration with a solution of albumin which is then discarded. As opposed to other methods of albumin dialysis SPAD is simple to perform and does not require the purchase of specialised equipment. We have evaluated the clinical use of SPAD in patients with severe liver dysfunction.METHODS. 25 patients with severe liver dysfunction requiring intensive care underwent 48 sessions of SPAD. Median SOFA score was 13 (range 6-21), mean serum total bilirubin was 466\u00b5mol/L, and mean serum creatinine was196\u00b5mol/L prior to treatment.",
