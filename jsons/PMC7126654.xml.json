Laboratory studies demonstrated the white blood cell count (4.3 \u00d7 109/L) and blood procalcitonin level were also normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased at 23 mm/h (normal range, 0\u201320 mm/h). A swab test and chest CT scanning were performed. Chest CT images illustrated multiple patchy, cloud-like high-density shadows in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1\na and c). Three real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.",

The imaging characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia may be bifocal extra-zonal distribution, bilateral, multifocal 2, 3. With typical clinical presentation and a clear epidemiological history, 2019-nCoV infection may be strongly suspected when chest CT has the characteristics of viral pneumonia despite negative RT-PCR results.
