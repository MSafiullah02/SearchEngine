More recently, the pervasiveness of mobile computing devices [11] and other developments associated to the Internet of Things (IoT) all necessitate reflection on the role of geographic space in making information collected and stored accessible, not just indexed using words and numbers but also spatially. However, to date, not ECIR nor other IR conferences have offered a tutorial for interested researchers and practitioners, making the body of research that make up the state of the art accessible.",
