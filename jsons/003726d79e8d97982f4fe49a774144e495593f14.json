At about the same time, Scadding4 in the United Kingdom proposed the term fibrosing alveolitis, suggesting (incorrectly) that DIP and UIP were early and late phases of a single disorder. 5 There has subsequently been much discussion and controversy over what patterns should be included in such a classification system, in terms of both histology and what these patterns represent regarding clinical disease. As a result, some patterns have now been categorized according to their recognized causes; for example, GIP has been reclassified as a pneumoconiosis, the cause being exposure to cobalt during the production of hard metals or during diamond polishing (see Chapter 26).6.7 Other patterns such as LIP were reclassified as preneoplastic disorders in the context of lymphoproliferative disease during the 1980s and 1990s (see Chapter 32) , but with greater understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary lymphomas through proteomics and genomics, cases are again treated more as interstitial pneumonias.",

First, terms were being used in different ways by clinicians and pathologists, some as purely histopathologic patterns, some as clinical diseases, and some as both. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) described the same well-defined clinical entity, but had different histopathologic equivalents; IPF was said to show only a pattern of UIP,13 while CFA encompassed a wider range of patterns, including UIP and DIP'14 Second, some terms were not histogenetically accurate; for example, DIP is neither desquamative nor predominantly interstitial. Third, more recently described patterns such as NSIP were poorly characterized in terms of their clinical correlates. Yet, despite these shortcomings, evidence accumulated from around the world that recognition of these histopathologic patterns provides significant prognostic data ( Fig. 19.2 ).14-20 The 1990s also saw a meteoric rise in the importance of the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for diagnosing any diffuse parenchymal lung disease, especially interstitial pneumonias,21-23 and all these factors, therefore, led to the creation of an American Thoracic Societyl European Respiratory Society-sponsored committee comprising clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists, who then developed and proposed a consensus classification system for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (Table 19 .2) and an algorithm for its usage (Fig. 19.3) . 24 This classification, based on seven histopathologic patterns, has become the cornerstone for interpreting surgical lung biopsies in this setting, although it is not without its critics and is already undergoing refinement in relation to smokingrelated disease and new patterns of disease described since 2002.",

Typically, the physician, radiologist, and surgeon discuss the case prior to operation, to determine the area(s) where disease activity is thought to be best represented, so that the biopsy is most likely to provide diagnostic tissue. 13 ,24 Studies suggest that taking biopsies from multiple sites also reduces sampling error and provides more valuable prognostic data. 19 It is also especially important to avoid areas of end-stage lung (fortunately the days of receiving solely the tip of the right middle lobe or lingula are largely over) (see Chapter 1). Historically, such cases have always been reported as being \"consistent with IPFICFA,\" and it is true that most cases of end-stage lung are the result of UIP. However, studies looking at the ability to differentiate end-stage UIP from other end-stage disorders such NSIP have shown poor interobserver reproducibility,14 and it is preferable to classify these changes as no more than end-stage lung or honeycomb lung rather than assign a histopathologic pattern. 12 ,J4.27 As stated above, such areas can be avoided by preoperative discussion in order to select the ideal site for biopsy13.24; otherwise HRCT data are usually of more value than the biopsy. 28 Opinion is divided as to whether biopsies should be inflated with formalin upon receipt in the laboratory, in that this process improves morphology and fixation, but runs the risk of both washing out diagnostic features such as accumulation of macrophages and distorting the architecture if undertaken in too zealous a fashion. My approach is to undertake very gentle injection of formalin only. Sampling of fresh frozen tissue and for electron microscopy is also recommended in case other rare forms of diffuse parenchymal lung disease are unexpectedly found on microscopy and further investigations are required, although this tissue is not processed in the majority of cases.",

At an acinar level, the changes are characteristically subpleural or paraseptal in distribution, typically being sharply demarcated from areas of normal or nearly normal alveolar lung ( Fig. 19 .5). This low power distribution is one of the cardinal features of UIP. The other cardinal feature is localized areas of fibroblastic proliferation termed fibroblastic foci that abut the areas of established fibrosis. The fibroblastic foci comprise an abundance of plump spindle cells and little intervening collagen, compared to the poorly cellular hyalinized collagen seen in of a lung in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis shows extensive peripheral honeycombing. areas of established fibrosis ( Fig. 19.6 ). This variation in the age of fibrosis is termed by some as \"temporal heterogeneity,\" and the patchy distribution as \"spatial heterogeneity.\" These fibroblastic foci are thought to FIGURE 19.6 . A high-power view from a case of usual interstitial pneumonia shows several fibroblastic foci in continuity with areas of established fibrosis. represent the sites of repeated and continued lung damage,29-31 not least because the extent of these foci is associated with mortality and an increased rate of disease progression. 32 . 33 However, although there have been significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of IPFICFA, the exact cause remains unknown. 34 In association with the fibrosis, there is a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of usually mild and no more than moderate intensity, mainly comprising small lymphocytes with occasional plasma cells. Aggregates of B lymphocytes may also be present, although these are not usually prominent in idiopathic disease. Small aggregates of inflammation and vascularity may be seen immediately beneath the fibroblastic foci ( Fig. 19.6 ). As the disease becomes more advanced, alveolar architecture is increasingly lost with the eventual formation of cysts separated by bands of fibrosis, so-called end-stage lung or honeycombing. These dilated air spaces show varying degrees of bronchiolization and, less commonly, goblet cell hyperplasia. Features such as smooth muscle hypertrophy, type 2 cell hyperplasia, endarteritis obliterans, osseous metaplasia, and squamous metaplasia are also found in UIP, but these are likely to be secondary phenomena and are not specific to this pattern ( Fig. 19.7) . Occasionally, eosinophilic pneumonia-like areas may be seen in UIP. These patients are described as slightly younger at presentation, although prognosis appears similar to cases without such areas. How these cases relate to levels of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also unknown. 35 The histopathologic features of VIP are summarized in Table 19 .3.",

Early studies have suggested smoking as a risk factor, although more recent data argue against this.42 There is no geographic or ethnic predilection. Rarely, the disease may be familia1. 43 Symptoms include dyspnea, dry cough, and loss of weight. Inspiratory bilateral basal crackles are heard, and there is often clubbing of the fingers. Lung function tests show restrictive abnormalities. In terms of imaging, chest x-rays typically show small lung fields and irregular reticulonodular or nodular shadows at the periphery and bases of the lungs. In advanced disease, honeycomb shadows and features of pulmonary hypertension may also be seen. However, the chest x-ray has been largely superseded by HRCT since the early 1990s, and the features are virtually pathognomonic in classic cases of IPF, these being bilateral coarse irregular reticular changes that predominate in a subpleural and peripheral distribution ( Fig. 19 .8). Traction bronchiectasias and honeycomb change are also frequently seen. A ground-glass pattern may also be present. 24 Serologic investigations may show a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and there may also be antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor present in about one third of patients, although the titers are usually low compared to those patients with pulmonary fibrosis associated with connective tissue disorders abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a further investigative tool that has had impact on research and to a lesser degree management of these patients, via assessing the differential cell count within fluid injected into and then aspirated from the peripherallung. 44 ,45 In a typical patient with IPF, there is an increase in the overall cell count with excess neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils ( Fig. 19.9 ). The presence of increased neutrophils and eosinophils has been associated with a worse prognosis in patients classified as CFA,46 and more recent studies looking specifically at VIP support the earlier data,47 although neutrophils may merely reflect severity whereas eosinophils may reflect future disease progression. 48 A lymphocytosis is comparatively rare and warrants investigation of other causes of pulmonary fibrosis, particularly chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia. 44 . 47",

Of these recent trials, data suggest that interferon-Y'9-51 and N-acetylcysteine 52 ,53 may provide additional benefit to the patient, but these drugs are yet to be fully evaluated,54,55 Transplantation, often of a single lung, is an alternative treatment option, although this is clearly dependent on constraints of organ availability, Prognosis is poor, with more recent studies showing 50% survival of less than 3 years,5,14-20.36-41 Death is usually due to respiratory failure, either chronically progressive or due to an acute exacerbation (see Diffuse Alveolar Damage and Acute Interstitial Pneumonia, below), cardiac failure, or lung cancer.

However, the injurious agent or agents are not known, with viruses,60--63 occupational agents,64 gastric reflux,65 and drugs 66 . 67 all being putative candidates. However, no single agent appears to playa causative role. 34 There are also features in common with pulmonary fibrosis seen in association with connective tissue disorders, with serologic investigations not infrequently showing hyperglobulinemia and the presence of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor. 25 ,36 Other studies have shown antibodies directed against the alveolar epithelium. 68 Therefore, IPF/CFA may represent a form of autoimmune disease with the alveolar epithelium as the target tissue. Genetic susceptibility may also play a role, with functional polymorphisms for various cytokines associated with increased incidence of IPp69,70 and familial cases being associated with mutations related to the surfactant protein-C gene. 71 Considerable research effort is now concentrated on the alveolar epithelial cells as the site of initial injury. The hyperplastic pneumocytes express numerous profibrotic cytokines, including transforming growth factor-~ (TGF-~), as well as other cytokines that may inhibit cell migration and therefore repair of damaged alveoli. This lack of reepithelialization in part may also be due to increased pneumocyte apoptosis and cell death, perhaps promoted by cytokines the epithelial cells and myofibroblasts secrete, such as TGF-~. The loss of epithelium, with apposition of basement membranes and subsequent collapse likely contributes to the remodeling process, and this dysregulation of repair may also drive sustained fibroblastic proliferation in the underlying stroma. 55 As stated earlier, the extent of these fibroblastic foci correlates with the rate of disease progression and mortality.32,33 The fibroblasts show an altered typically myofibroblastic phenotype that reflects activation with regard to production of extracellular matrix proteins. Persistence of this activated phenotype likely contributes to development of chronic fibrosis and remodeling, along with a reduced capacity for degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, through imbalances between matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors. A detailed review of the various cytokines has recently been published by Thannickal et al. (Fig. 19.10 ). 55 However, although emphasis has shifted away from IPF's being a disease driven by inflammation, inflammatory cells still likely play significant roles in modulating disease. 33 gesting that the epithelium may be recognized as autoantigenic by the cytotoxic TS cells. 68 . 74 However T-helper lymphocytes are also found, and a shift from type I (generally antifibrotic) to type II (generally profibrotic) cytokine profiles may also contribute to fibrosis. 55 ,75 Other inflammatory cells such as macro phages, mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils, also likely contribute to overall disease activity.",

Occasional fibroblastic foci may further confuse the picture. However, although bronchocentricity may be absent on biopsy, it may be more easily apparent on HRCT with the advantage therein of assessing the whole lung. A similar lack of bronchocentricity and granulomas may cause less chronic cases to be preferentially classified as cellular NSIP. In both instances, undertaking biopsies from different sites obviates what is often a sampling error, and good clinical correlation will often identify other salient features, on clinical questioning, bronchoalveolar lavage, or via serologic investigations.",

However, defining SRILD is not that straightforward, as interstitial changes are complicated by emphysema of varying degree, and there may be some cases that histopathologically are closer to NSIP (see Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia, above). These areas of research notwithstanding, it is reasonable to group cases with RB, DIP, or LCG as SRILD, but only in the context of a history of smoking and appropriate radiology, and it is often useful to ascribe this term when features overlap among the various patterns in surgical lung biopsies and there is a history of smoking. However, the individual terms should be maintained within this heading, as there remain important differences between the entities therein. For example, histopathologically there are differences in severity between the RB and DIP, with an increased extent of fibrosis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and eosinophil numbers in DIP. 107 Epidemiologically, nearly all cases of RB are related to inhalation of smoke, while about 10% of DIP may be due to other causes. Clinical presentation and courses also differ, with DIP being more aggressive than RBILD and with no evidence that progression from RBILD to DIP occurS. 119 The BAL profiles of the two diseases are also dissimilar. 47 On HRCT, the micronodular abnormalities of RBILD are not seen in DIP, and although HRCT follow-up data are rare, there is evidence that DIP may progress to a fine fibrosis akin to fibrotic NSIP,107 while the only follow-up data on RB suggest it may progress to centrilobular emphysema. 103 Finally, the indications for corticosteroid treatment are often marginal in RBILD, whereas treatment is usually more active in DIP. Therefore, DIP and RBILD should continue to be regarded as separate entities, and the term smoking related-interstitial lung disease should be used with caution outside of DIP, RBILD, and LCG in patients with a smoking history until the relevance of coexistent emphysema and interstitial fibrosis are better clarified.",
