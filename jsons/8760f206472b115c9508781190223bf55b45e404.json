However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number for populations with local person-to-person transmission and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since 1 , but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two cases studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.",

Other pathogens move across population boundaries due to the movement of people. In the absence of transmission from other populations or reservoirs, the basic reproduction number -the average number of secondary cases arising from each primary case in a susceptible population -determines whether a disease will die out or persist through ongoing person-to-person transmission. Effective interventions can interrupt transmission by reducing the basic reproduction number below 1 causing the disease to die out in that population. However, any reservoir exposure or imported cases will continue to replenish the infected population, and so a disease will die out in a population if and only if the basic reproduction number is <1 and all reservoir exposure and importation are avoided. There is a rich literature in metapopulation models that capture the interactions of populations that introduce or reintroduce pathogens to one another (e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] ). However, one often only has data or interest in a single population but needs to account for external sources of infections. It is in this context that we wish to generate some simple principles or rules for estimating the reproduction number.",

Others have developed methods to account for the often large proportion of imported cases at the beginning of new epidemics, which if excluded or treated as if locally acquired would overestimate the reproduction number [7] . Though the term 'elimination' has been defined in many different ways [8] , reducing the local reproduction number below one is one measure of this progress [9] , and is a necessary step towards global eradication. Methods have been developed to estimate the reproduction number that account for the potentially large proportion of imported cases in settings where progress is being made towards elimination [9] . However none of these methods account for susceptible depletion and so are restricted to diseases with very low prevalence [5, 6, 9] or calculate the effective reproduction number [7] , which is not a threshold parameter for disease persistence. Starting with simple models and incorporating heterogeneity or multiple strains, we have derived simple rules for estimating the reproduction number in a population where the disease is at endemic equilibrium due to a combination of local person-to-person transmission and reservoir exposure or imported cases. Many of these rules only require knowledge of disease prevalence and the proportion of infections attributable to the external source. We have applied these rules in two case studies of C. difficile infections.",

Person-to-person transmission could be through direct contact, or mediated via fomites, airborne droplets, water or food provided this transmission scales with the infectious population. For our purposes a reservoir is anywhere where the pathogen persists apart from the human population, for instance a population of wild animals or livestock animals that carry the disease.

For diseases with comprehensive vaccination programs (or common diseases with lifelong immunity), almost all the population can be immune (e.g. 95%) and the proportion susceptible very low. If reservoir exposure accounts for nearly all cases but is still less than the reservoir-driven threshold (e.g. 90%), the disease could be sustained by person-to-person transmission alone if reservoir exposure was eliminated (since . . 1) and so eliminating exposure to the reservoir would not eliminate the disease from the human population.",

Disruption of the gut flora, often caused by consumption of antibiotics or proton-pump-inhibitors, allows C. difficile to proliferate in large numbers [23] . Toxigenic strains of C. difficile then produce a number of toxins that can cause diarrhoea which is often severe and sometimes life-threatening [24] .

Unfortunately, we do not have strain-level or type-level data for all strains or types. However, the article used to calculate our first estimate of the reproduction number report the proportion of infections and colonisations typed as NAP1/RT027 [27] . As the authors did not type all isolates, we assume that un-typed isolates were equally likely to be NAP1/RT027 as the isolates from similar patients that were typed, and that the proportion of NAP1/RT027 infections in those with onset <72h after admission (not reported) was similar to patients with colonisation at admission (13%). Under these assumptions, approximately 32 out of 150 (21%) colonisations or infections with NAP1/RT027 were present at admission. Of the approximately 10% of cases that were colonised or infected for some part of their hospital stay, approximately 3% were with NAP1/RT027 and the remaining 7% were with other types. Though colonisation with non-toxigenic strains appears to be protective against infection with toxigenic strains [37] , we do not have good information about the interaction of C. difficile types.

Some individuals will have higher exposure to these reservoirs (depending on diet and lifestyle factors), but this alone will not affect the reservoir-driven threshold unless those with greater exposure are also are more (or less) infectious (Section 4.3). If we heterogeneous infectiousness of those with and without symptoms, or with and without recent antimicrobial exposure, this also does not affect the food driven exposure in isolation (Section 4.2). However, communities are not homogeneous with regards to C. difficile colonisation risk, as demonstrated by the higher rates of colonisation and infection in hospitals, aged-care facilities and the very high colonisation rates amongst infants. Accounting for this heterogeneity will increase our estimate of the reservoir-driven threshold (Section 4.1).",

If only 1% of the healthy adult population is colonised, then overall prevalence is 3.0% but the reservoir-driven threshold is much higher at 81.1%. These extreme values taken from across the literature are not typical and are unlikely to coincide in a single population.

With prevalence half of the maximum reported values (i.e. (A) 14.5%, (B) 25.5%, (C) 45% and (D) 7.5%), which is still probably much higher than typical for infants in particular [41] , the reservoir-driven threshold is only 13.0%.

The risk-categories of individuals change over time as patients age or move in and out of hospitals and so a multi-patch with age structure would provide better estimates. Nevertheless, this very simple calculation serves as a back-of-the-envelope estimate for the plausible range of the reservoir-driven threshold, demonstrating that under a range of reasonable assumptions a relatively small amount of transmission from animals could be sustaining endemic disease in human populations. Our simple calculations with figures from the middle of the reported prevalence range agree with a detailed, model of hospitals and communities that found the reservoir-driven threshold was between 3.5% and 26.0% for a wide range of plausible assumptions.",

C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 (RT078) is a particularly good candidate to consider as a reservoir-driven strain. Though it is not known what proportion of human RT078 cases can be attributed to transmission from an animal source, whole-genome sequencing of isolates of this strain from livestock and humans strongly suggest frequent transmission between these groups [42] . On the other hand NAP1/RT027 which is found in livestock but appears to be more transmissible between people than other strains, might have some human cases attributable to animal sources but is less likely to be animal-driven [43] .

The rules require minimal information about the population and the pathogen of interest and could be a useful starting point or alternative to more complex models tailored to a population or pathogen. Churcher et al. have developed a statistical test using branching process theory to infer whether 1 in a population nearing disease elimination but with many imported cases [9] . Cauchemez et. al use a similar approach that accounts for incomplete case detection and the overrepresentation of larger outbreaks to estimate the reproduction number for emerging zoonoses [5] . However, their models assume almost all the population is susceptible and so are not suitable for situations where the prevalence of infection or immunity is far from zero. Moreover, the latter method assumes that the reproduction is less than one so is not appropriate in settings where is there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the reproduction number is above or below one [5] . Our model accounts for susceptible depletion and works for infections where the reproduction number is above or below one, but relies on estimates of prevalence to do so. This can pose a potential difficulty as incidence rather than prevalence is usually reported. Reliable estimates of prevalence either requires near-perfect case acquisition or surveys with large sample sizes especially when prevalence is low. Indeed a good deal of the variability in colonisation prevalence reported for C. difficile outside hospitals might be attributed to the relatively small sample sizes involved [32] .",

It does not follow that if a disease is reservoir-driven or importation driven, then interventions targeting the external source and transmission from the external source will be most effective or 'best'. The 'best' control strategy will depend on the relative effort required to prevent each kind of exposure, the impact of these interventions and metric used to compare these. If it is equally feasible and desirable to eliminate all (or most) exposure from either source, eliminating transmission from the reservoir or importation is clearly the better choice for a reservoir-driven or importation disease as this will prevent all local human cases, while preventing all person-to-person transmission will prevent only the proportion of human cases spread locally by humans. However, if only modest reductions are feasible, then targeting local human transmission may be more effective. One can calculate the normalised derivatives of equilibrium prevalence to estimate the reduction in prevalence achieved by a small reduction in person-to-person transmission or exposure to the external source. For example, in the homogenous SIS model with reservoir-exposure, a greater reduction in prevalence is achieved by reducing person-to-person transmission whenever less than half of cases are acquired from the reservoir 1 . This is true whether or not the disease is reservoir-driven. A similar rule can be derived for the SIS model with imported cases.",
