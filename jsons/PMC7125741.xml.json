Myxoma virus (MV), the causative agent of myxomatosis, belongs to the Leporipoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family [1]. In its natural host, Sylvilagus rabbits in the Americas, MV induces a mild benign infection. In European rabbits however, MV causes the systemic and lethal infection known as myxomatosis [2], [3]. The disease is endemic in the entire rabbit range in Europe since the deliberate release of MV in France (1952) as a biological control agent of wild rabbit populations. Immunization of domestic rabbits against myxomatosis is currently achieved using heterologous vaccines based on Shope fibroma virus, a less virulent Leporipoxvirus, or homologous vaccines based on cell culture-attenuated strains of MV [4], [5].",

Infected rabbits usually die within 48\u201372 h of necrotising hepatitis. RHD is responsible for high economic losses in rabbitries as well as high mortality rates in wild rabbit populations [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The etiological agent, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), is a member of the Caliciviridae family [13]. The RHDV virions are non-enveloped and icosahedral, with capsids composed of a major protein component of 60 kDa (VP60). Commercial vaccines against RHD are prepared from the livers of experimentally infected rabbits [14], since in vitro systems are not available for efficient virus propagation. In the last years, the VP60 gene has been successfully expressed in several heterologous systems [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] and has been shown to induce full protection of rabbits against a lethal challenge with RHDV.",

In order to protect wild rabbits against both myxomatosis and RHD, we constructed a recombinant virus based on the naturally attenuated MV field strain 6918 [24], that expressed the RHDV VP60 protein [25]. A linear epitope tag from the nucleoprotein of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was included within the recombinant VP60 protein to allow monitoring the spread of the recombinant virus in the environment. Following inoculation of rabbits, the recombinant virus (6918VP60-T2) induced specific antibody responses against MV, RHDV as well as for the TGEV tag. Administration of 6918VP60-T2 by the subcutaneous, intradermal or oral routes protected rabbits against lethal RHDV and MV challenges. Furthermore, the recombinant 6918VP60-T2 virus showed a limited horizontal transmission capacity, either by direct contact or in a flea-mediated process, promoting immunization of contact uninoculated animals [25].",

The oral route is considered a feasible way of vaccine administration. For example, oral vaccination is being used to control enzootic sylvatic rabies in Europe and North America by means of a recombinant vaccinia-rabies vaccine delivered by baiting [26]. An alternative strategy is the use of \u201ctransmissible vaccines\u201d, i.e., viral vectors capable of spreading within an animal population. Hopefully, the administration of a recombinant vaccine of this characteristics to a small number of captured individuals, would eventually lead to the immunization of a fraction of animals within a given population, which is sufficient to reduce the spread of the target disease. This approach might be useful, especially when the distribution, size, and turnover rate of a population precludes capture or baiting techniques as the only means for antigen delivery. The European rabbit is an example of such a population. With this in mind, we have developed a transmissible vaccine against both myxomatosis and RHD based on a recombinant MV-VP60 virus capable of spreading through rabbit populations [25]. The results obtained under laboratory conditions suggest the recombinant virus might be effective for wild rabbit immunization. However, since the proposed use of 6918VP60-T2 involves the environmental release of a recombinant virus, considerations regarding safety issues are as important as the potential efficacy of the candidate vaccine. It is for this reason that safety concerns have been at the core of the rational design of the proposed immunization strategy.",

Thus, the host restricted nature of MV minimises the risk of recombinant vaccine spreading to non-target species in nature.

Instead, we decided to use an attenuated MV field strain which was already circulating among wild rabbit populations. Strain 6918 was selected from a field survey of MV strains circulating in Spain, which were analysed for virulence and transmissibility [24]. This strain exhibited adequate biological characteristics for the development of a recombinant transmissible vaccine, as it caused a non-pathogenic infection comparable to that of cell culture-attenuated vaccinal strains, yet retaining the capacity of horizontal spreading [24].",

Moreover, the VP60 expression cassette was inserted into the MV genome using the TDS two-step selection system [28]. This procedure enables the construction of recombinant poxviruses without any marker genes inserted in the final recombinant viral genome. Thus, the recombinant 6918VP60-T2 does not harbour selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes, the widespread of which is currently regarded as a major health and environmental threat. Considering the potential risks associated with the DNA sequence inserted, it should be noted that the VP60 gene has been cloned in a wide range of heterologous systems[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] and no indication of toxicity or side effects associated to the expression of VP60 have been reported.",

Assessment of vaccine effects in immunosuppressed rabbits was considered relevant, given the incidence in nature of immunocompromised individuals due to infections, environmental or genetic causes. For this reason we assayed the effect of vaccine administration in rabbits treated with prednisolone, a potent immunosuppressor. This treatment induces depletion of circulating eosinophils and mononuclear cells, causing a strong decrease of the T-cell response with only a slight effect on B-cell function [29]. It is a commonly used procedure for the safety evaluation of veterinary vaccines [30], [31], [32]. Results showed that prednisolone treated rabbits exhibited similar symptoms to those observed in control rabbits (Fig. 2, Table 3). The only remarkable observation was that immunosuppressed rabbits showed a subtle tendency to delay the resolution of local lesions: 16\u201318 dpi vs. 15 dpi (Fig. 2). Another important aspect addressed was the effect of 6918VP60-T2 virus infection in reproduction. Results showed that recombinant virus inoculation did not alter the reproduction parameters and none of the rabbits born from vaccinated does showed myxomatosis-associated clinical signs (Table 4). In conclusion, the overall results obtained demonstrate a notable lack of adverse effects attributable to the recombinant virus, regardless of dose, route or life history stage of individuals (i.e., neonate, young, pregnant does or immunocompromised).",

The environmental release of recombinant 6918VP60-T2 virus would involve a certain number of serial passages in its natural host, even when this capability seemed to be limited to only two serial passages under laboratory conditions [25]. Should there be a tendency for the virus to evolve to a virulent state, serial passage in rabbits would cause it to do so. Accordingly, the biological stability of 6918VP60-T2 was studied by subjecting the virus to 10 serial passages in rabbits, and the results obtained (Fig. 3, Table 5) indicated the recombinant virus maintained grossly the same biological characteristics through the passages. Thus, the attenuated nature of 6918VP60-T2 seems to be a stable trait. On the other hand, the genetic analysis indicated that the VP60 gene remained stably integrated in the MV genome after serial passage in rabbits, in agreement with the previously reported results obtained after 15 serial passages of 6918VP60-T2 virus in RK-13 cell monolayers [25].",
