            "text": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a hydroxylated derivative of chloroquine, developed in 1955. It was initially developed as an anti-malarial but its mass use led to the serendipitious discovery of its anti-inflammatory action. 1 Chemically, it is an alkylated 4-aminoquinolines (4-AQ), hydroxyl derivative of 7chloro-4(-4-diethylamino-1-methyl butyl amino) quinolone, 2 which is used as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of various inflammatory and connective tissue disorders. The exact mechanism of HCQ toxicity is unknown, but it is considered owing to 4-aminoquinoline nucleus of the chemical. 3 Its toxicity is a dose and duration-dependent definite phenomenon rather than an idiosyncracy. Binding of HCQ to lysosomes and endosomes via inhibition of activation of toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9). It raises intraorganelle pH leads to ineffective degradation and storage of these toxic products and eventually cell damage. The toxic effects are due to accumulation of proteins ubiquinated by 4-AQs, which causes apoptosis, autophagy disruption, and oxidative damage.",

Mititelu et al. reported the integrity of ELM in and around fovea on SD-OCT was associated with preservation and possibility of regeneration of ellipsoid zone. ELM disruption was associated with photoreceptor remodeling and its presence was a poor prognostic indicator for reversal of toxicity on stopping the medication. 10 The baseline ophthalmological consultation is advised ideally, before starting the therapy or at least within first year of starting the therapy. 2 This helps in documenting any preexisting macular conditions and documenting patient's baseline visual functions. If high-risk factors are present, the screening can begin sooner. The recent screening recommendations on HCQ retinopathy by American Academy of Ophthalmology has recommended SD-OCT and automated field analysis as primary screening tests. 2 The screening tests recommended in this protocol can further be divided into subjective and objective tests.",

In Asian patients, perifoveal and further peripheral involvement, which might me missed in central 10e2 fields, warrants VFA 24e2 or VFA 30e2. Perifoveal and extramacular involvement is not exclusive in Asians and is seen in 12% Asian population and 2% Caucasian population. 2 It should be emphasized that these patterns have only 4 central test spots representing central macula and reduced sensitivity even in 1 central spot is abnormal. The visual fields are highly variable, but when reliable, it provides an excellent tool to detect toxicity in perifoveal and extrafoveal areas. The parafoveal visual field defect involves 2e6 degrees of central field and perifoveal visual field defects may not be detectable in 10e2 visual field testing. The most commonly affected inferotemporal macular region in HCQ toxicity extrapolates as a superonasal field defect. If VFA is uncertain, it should be retested or other objective tests should be considered. About 10% patients have visual field abnormalities with normal SD-OCT. In such conditions, repeating the visual fields or mf-ERG is considered to detect any evidence of structural damage. Objective or structural test SD-OCT may show localized areas of photoreceptor layer thinning or loss in parafoveal areas in non-Asian eyes and perifoveal, reaching up to arcades in Asian eyes. 3 The wider angle SD-OCT which can take at least central 30 is the preferred modality of objective screening in Asian eyes.

ELM loss was present at 4 years with daily dosing of 4 mg/kg/day. The prevalence of HCQ retinopathy in this study was reported 2.4% with SD-OCT alone and 4.8% with VFA alone. However, when SD-OCT and VFA were combined, the prevalence of definite retinopathy was 1.8% and possible retinopathy was 3.6% making a total prevalence of 5.4% which is less compared to the prevalence of retinopathy which is 7.5% based on large population based studies. 2 This discrepancy can be possibly due to relatively small sample size of this study and the limitation of SD-OCT in detecting perifoveal and extrafoveal structural damage to macula which are more common in Asian population 2 which can be detected easily in a wide-field OCT or mf-ERG. The role of VFA 30e2 or 24e2 is valuable in detecting these defects in absence of SD-OCT findings and can be confirmed by other objective tests such as mf-ERG. Our study also found SD-OCT based macular defect in a case using HCQ at a dose 4 mg/kg/day and a case of definite retinopathy in duration of 1 year. Thus, a study with larger sample size or multicentric study is recommended to study the impact of dose and duration on prevalence of HCQ maculopathy in Indian population where a dose of 400 mg daily might often exceed recommended daily dose of less than 5 mg/kg/day.",

VFA which establishes functional defect is complementary to SD-OCT for definite diagnosis but it is time-consuming, cumbersome, and at times unreliable. This study reflects the need of incorporating wide-field OCT or mf-ERG to detect objective changes in the screening protocol for Indian population, as the gap in the knowledge still exists about prevalence of parafoveal, perifoveal, and extrafoveal maculopathy among HCQ users.",

SD-OCT, spectral domain optical coherence tomography. one of the earliest immune-modulators developed and it has improved the quality of life of millions of patients suffering from autoimmune and connective tissue disorders. Recent recommendations of use of HCQ for treatment of cases and prophylaxis in COVID -19 contacts and involved health-care workers makes it imperative to revisit the dreaded irreversible adverse effect of the drug on central visual acuity due to maculopathy. The literature and clinical experience have proven without an iota doubt that exposure to systemic use of HCQ is a risk factor for toxic retinopathy, which is irreversible, and when advanced, can lead to permanent loss of central visual acuity.The screening for retinopathy will detect the earliest abnormalities associated with HCQ retinopathy and provide us with a fair idea about-'if to stop', 'when to stop'. Various case series estimated that over 34e40% patients on HCQ are unscreened.The most recently published 'Recommendations on screening for Chloroquine and HCQ Retinopathy (2016 Revision)' e American Academy of Ophthalmology statement and The Royal College of Ophthalmologists: Clinical Guidelines on 'Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine Retinopathy: Recommendations on screening' (February 2018) are the latest revisions.
