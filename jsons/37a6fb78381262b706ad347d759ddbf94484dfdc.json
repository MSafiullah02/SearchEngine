Given that pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be similar to SARS-CoV, most patients infected SARS-CoV-2 will express specific IgG antibody within a week to three months after infection.(9) In light of this time to seroconversion, 5 (5.4%) participants with positive antibody and 15 (16.3%) participants with borderline antibody presumed to expose SARS-CoV-2 between December 2019 and March 2020. These results provoked the hypothesis that COVID-19 had already spread at early stage of pandemic in Kyoto.

Although other researchers suggested that the differences of viral genotypes and virulence may affect the morbidity and mortality, this explanation is also not enough. National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan revealed first wave of COVID-19 pandemic derived from Wuhan, China stamped out at the end of March and second wave of COVID-19 pandemic derived from European countries spread across the country from the end of March.(12) During the second wave, Japan still has been keeping much lower morbidity and mortality than Western countries at the end of April.(13) Kamikubo et al. hypothesized that pandemic spread of low virulence type of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent exposure to mild virulence type of SARS-CoV-2 induced herd immunity that reduced the severity of high virulence type of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan.(14) The results of borderline antibody titer level of our study may reflect this hypothesis. From our results, participants with a history of seasonal common cold from winter 2019 to early spring 2020 had significantly more SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer than participants without history. This might be affected by a pre-pandemic exposure to low and middle virulence type of SARS-CoV-2.
