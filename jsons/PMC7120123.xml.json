Flavonoids are secondary plant metabolites involved in several biological processes (e.g., germination, UV protection, insecticides) and are also involved in the attraction of pollinating agents via the vivid colors of the anthocyanin pigments found in flowers (e.g., blue, purple, yellow, orange, and red) [1\u20133]. Flavonoids are found in the normal human diet composed of green vegetables, onions, fruits (apples, grapes, strawberries, etc.), beverages (coffee, tea, beer, red wine) [4, 5], and isoflavonoids are mainly found in soya bean-derived products [6].",

Other authors estimate the daily consumption of flavonoids (e.g., polyphenols) to be about 150\u20131000 mg/day [13]. A recent study in France has shown that fruits (mainly apples and strawberries) and vegetables (e.g., potatoes, lettuce, onions) account for about 28% of the daily intake in polyphenols, and that the total consumption would be over 300 mg/day [14]. Because fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and red wine are all rich in flavonoids, the focus of several research teams is now to identify which flavonoid is responsible for a given pharmacological effect and to better understand its molecular mechanism of action.",

In humans, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 are mostly involved in flavonoid hydroxylation [20]. Phase II metabolism (conjugation) involves glucuronidation, sulfatation, and methylation. The metabolism by the intestinal flora is also important and can lead to demethylation and ring fission [21]. Major differences in metabolism may exist between laboratory animals and humans, as was recently shown with the synthetic flavone-8-acetic acid which is thought to be activated in vivo in mice to anticancer active metabolites [22]. It was also recently shown that aminoflavone was activated to antiproliferative active metabolites through sulfatation [23].",

            "text": "Several mammalian enzymatic systems have been reported to be inhibited by flavonoids, for example, kinases, topoisomerase I, glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450 s, aromatase, and so on. [24]. This large number of enzymatic systems affected by flavonoids is probably responsible for the rather large pharmacological activities reported for this class of agents that we briefly mention below before focusing on flavonoids as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic anticancer agents.\nCardiovascular diseases: A recent study has shown that chronic administration of polyphenols from red wine in rats can prevent hypertension and vascular dysfunction [25]. In humans, a flavonoid-rich diet (e.g., tea, onion, apple, etc.) has been linked to a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in several studies [26, 27]. Flavonoid and isoflavone intake were found to be the main phytochemicals contributing to the low incidence of coronary heart disease in Japanese women [28].\nAntioxidant: Among the numerous pharmacological properties of flavonoids, their antioxidant action is probably the most studied. Free radicals such as the hydroxyl (OH\u2022), the superoxyde anion (O2\n\u2022 \u2013), and the peroxylipidic radicals may be scavenged by flavonoids, mainly by the flavonoids bearing a C3 hydroxyl group (flavonols). Flavonoids can also chelate metal ions. The antioxidant hypothesis is, however, being challenged because compounds with similar antioxidant properties may present different biological effects [29]. It has also been reported that flavonoids can also scavenge the NO radical [30]. This radical is formed by several cell types (e.g., endothelial cells and macrophages) and its release is due to the NO synthase activity which is important in vascular tone regulation. Because some flavonoids can inhibit cyclooxygenase, this could explain the quercetin effect in counteracting the vasodilatation of NO on the vascular endothelium [31, 32]. In this context, it is worth pointing out that some synthetic flavones have been reported to downregulate both iNOS expression and NO expression in leukemia cells [33].\nVascular protection: Polyphenols have been shown to increase the formation of NO by endothelial NO synthase. Flavonoids have also been shown to contribute to the normalization of the vascular permeability [34, 35].\nHepatoprotection: Flavonoid extracts from Silybum marianum have been used in folk medicine against liver diseases in the form of a complex mixture comprising silybin which would act on the hepatocyte membrane to prevent the uptake of toxic compounds and would stimulate hepatocyte regeneration [36]. The hepatoprotective effects of silybin and quercetin have been shown in the rat model administered a toxic dose of paracetamol (acetaminophen) [37].\nAntiallergic: Certain flavonoids, for example, quercetin, can be antiallergenic by inhibiting enzymes involved in the histamine release from mastocytes and basophils (cAMP phosphodiesterase and Ca++ ATPase) [38, 39].\nAnti-inflammatory: The immune modulation of flavonoids appears to rely on their inhibition of eicosanoids and histamine formation and on their inhibition of free radical scavenging effects [40]. Several flavonoids can modify the metabolism of platelet arachidonic acid in vitro. Myricetin and quercetin can block cyclo-oxygenases and lipoxygenases action. Hesperidin is anti-inflammatory in a rat model of inflammation induced by carragenin or dextran. The interest in flavonoids as anti-inflammatory compounds is also underlined by their lack of gastric toxicity frequently encountered with other anti-inflammatory drugs [24, 41].\nAntiulcer: Some flavonoids can protect the gastric mucosa against ulcer-causing compounds. For example, hypolaetin-8-glucose, a flavonoid found in Sideritis species is considered as an active antiulcer compound. Naringin and quercetin are also antiulcerogen in the gastric ulceration induced by ethanol in the rat. The antiulcer properties of quercetin have been attributed to its mucus production activity [42]. In addition, quercetin can inhibit the growth of the ulcer-forming bacteria Helicobacter pylori and can decrease the production of chlorhydric acid by the gastric parietal cells [43].\nAntibacterial activity: Several flavonoids have been shown to possess antibacterial activity, for example, apigenin, galangin, chrysin, naringin, epigallocatechin gallate, luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol [44]. The activity of apigenin and galangin against both sensitive and antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is particularly noteworthy [45].\nAntiviral activity: An important activity of some flavonoids is the inhibition of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For example, acacetin, apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, hinokiflavone, myricetin, quercetagetin, robinetin, robustaflavone, and quercetin, were reported to be involved in HIV entry, infection, transcription, or replication in mammalian cells [46\u201350].\n",

Silybin has been shown to prevent skin cancer in animal models, and its use in humans has been suggested because of its low toxicity [78]. Structure-activity relationships have shown that the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl on ring B appears essential for activity in the prevention of skin cancer [79]. Several green tea extracts have demonstrated the inhibition of skin carcinogenesis by oral ingestion or topical application [80, 81].

Genistein and daidzein (isoflavones found in soya beans) can also inhibit hormone-dependent or independent mammary and prostate cancers in mice [87, 88].

Based on the growing interest of the scientific community in the study of natural products use in medicine, it seems likely that the next decade will see the emergence of new improved flavonoids, because this class of compounds offers an almost unlimited resource for new cancer drug discovery.",
