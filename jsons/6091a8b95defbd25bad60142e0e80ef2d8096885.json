However, a combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been found to be effective against SARS-CoV, and both drugs could bind well to the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CL pro ). In this work, molecular complexation between each inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and pair interaction energy analyses based on MM/PB(GB)SA and FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* methods. Both anti-HIV drugs interacted well with the residues at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Ritonavir showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts, a somewhat higher binding efficiency, and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lopinavir, which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3CL pro active site. In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The interactions in terms of electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19.",

            "text": "I n December 2019, there were many cases of patients reported to have a respiratory tract infection with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. It was found that these patients most likely had an epidemiological history related to a seafood market in that area of China. 1 However, a newly causative microbial infection cannot at first be identified in public databases. On the basis of whole genome sequencing, it was revealed that this microbial pathogen is a novel coronavirus, formally named 2019-nCoV, closely related to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, so-called SARS-CoV-2. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially confirmed the outbreak of 2019-nCoV on December 31, 2019, and eventually officially named it coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. In general, coronaviruses are characterized as enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and can infect humans and several animals, including mammals and birds. 4\u22127 Nonetheless, some coronaviruses can potentially cause severe infection in patients such as the well-known outbreak of SARS-CoV in Guangdong, China, 8 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in many countries of the Middle East. 9 Likewise, COVID-19 has been confirmed to be transmitted from humans to humans and quickly spread in several countries throughout the world. 10 SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which have their origins in bats. 11 For the clinical symptoms, COVID-19 infection culminates in fatal pneumonia with the clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV infection. 1 Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 might also develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to a high rate of admission to intensive care units and ultimately death in severe cases. 7 After infection, patients presented mild to severe symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, severe pneumonia, and septic shock. 1, 7 To date, many companies and academic research groups around the world have focused on searching for and developing a specific vaccine or antiviral drug to prevent or control emerging SARS-CoV-2 infections (e.g., vaccine, monoclonal antibodies, and small-molecule drugs). However, these options need several months to years for their development. Because of the urgent need to alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of repurposed existing antiviral drugs approved for treatment of other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza is somewhat promising, 12 based on previous successes of the therapeutic treatment with two relevant human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. According to numerous previous studies, 1,7,13\u221216 the nonstructural protein of coronavirus, in particular, main proteases or 3C-like proteases (3CL pro ), is considered an attractive drug target for the treatment of coronavirus infection. The role of this protease involves the proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein and is crucial for viral replication and maturation. 17 Moreover, 3CL pro has a similar common cleavage site among coronaviruses. 18 The sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (see Figure S1 ) shows that the SARS-CoV-2 proteinase is highly conserved compared to that of SARS-CoV with a 96.1% sequence identity.",

            "text": "A combination of the two approved drugs for HIV infection, lopinavir and ritonavir (KALETRA), has been reported to be active toward SARS and MERS. 14, 19 Both anti-HIV drugs were initially purposed to inhibit 3CL pro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and they appeared to be related to clinical benefits of patients with SARS in a nonrandomized open-label trial. 17 Although ritonavir is a protease inhibitor, it is generally used to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and markedly increases the plasma concentrations of other protease inhibitors. 20 Nevertheless, whether HIV protease inhibitors could effectively target SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is under debate. This is based on the fact that HIV protease is from the aspartic protease family, whereas SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro belongs to the cysteine protease family. Previously, a theoretical study of the molecular interaction of lopinavir and ritonavir with 3CL pro of SARS-CoV suggested that these two drugs could bind well at the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . 15 To date, the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro in a complex with lopinavir and ritonavir has not been reported. Thus, in our study, we aimed to investigate the binding interactions of lopinavir and ritonavir with the SARS-CoV-2 proteinase using both molecular modeling and quantum chemical methods. It is our hope that this information can be useful for the future design or development of more specific inhibitors for the treatment of human coronaviruses. Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article with lopinavir and ritonavir bound to protomer A, the positions of the original peptidelike inhibitor were changed to the corresponding drug for each P position ( Figure 1B ,C). This modification was performed according to the similar orientation with the template inhibitor using the small molecules tool implemented in Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5 (Accelrys Inc.). The protonation states of all ionizable amino acids were assigned at pH 7.4 using the H++ web server, 22 except for the catalytic residue H41 that was set as the neutral form with a protonated delta position (HID type of AMBER format) in accordance with the common reaction mechanism of cysteine protease. 23 The chemical structures of lopinavir (ZINC3951740) and ritonavir (ZINC3944422) were downloaded from the ZINC15 database. 24 The electrostatic potential (ESP) charges of both ligands were calculated with the HF/6-31G* level of theory using the Gaussian09 program. 25 The antechamber and parmchk modules of AMBER16 were used to generate the restrained ESP charges and missing parameters of the two drugs, respectively. The bonded and nonbonded parameters for the protein and ligand were treated with the AMBER ff14SB force field 26 and generalized AMBER force field version 2 (GAFF2), 27 accordingly. Missing hydrogen atoms were added using the LEaP module implemented in AMBER16. Afterward, the TIP3P water model 28 was used to solvate each system with a minimum distance of 10 \u00c5 between the protein surface and the solvation box edge, and the box dimensions were set to approximately 114 \u00c5 \u00d7 97 \u00c5 \u00d7 92 \u00c5. The sodium ions were then randomly added to neutralize the simulated systems. The added hydrogen atoms and water molecules were minimized using 500 steps of steepest descent (SD) followed by 1500 steps of conjugated gradient (CG) methods before running the MD simulations, while the rest of the molecules were held fixed. Then, the protein and ligand were minimized by SD (500 iterations) and CG (1500 iterations) methods with constrained solvent molecules. Finally, the whole complex was fully minimized using the same procedure. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Each system was simulated under the periodic boundary condition with the isothermal\u2212isobaric (NPT) scheme, as previously described. 29\u221232 Briefly, a cutoff distance for nonbonded interactions was set to 10 \u00c5, while the particle mesh Ewald summation method 33 was employed to treat the electrostatic interactions. The SHAKE algorithm 34 was used to constrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. A 2 fs simulation time step was used throughout the MD simulation. The temperature and pressure were controlled by the Langevin thermostat 35 with a collision frequency of 2 ps \u22121 and the Berendsen barostat 36 with a pressure-relaxation time of 1 ps. For the heating step, each simulated system was gradually heated from 10 to 310 K for 200 ps with a harmonic positional restraint of 30.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 applied to the C\u03b1 atoms of the protein. To equilibrate the system, each complex was then subjected to four steps of restrained MD simulations at 310 K with harmonic restraints of 30, 20, 10, and 5 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 for 1300 ps in total and another 200 ps without any restraint. Subsequently, the entire system was simulated under the NPT ensemble (310 K and 1 atm) until reaching 100 ns. The MD trajectories were saved every 10 ps. The calculations in terms of the root-mean-square displacement (RMSD), the number of protein\u2212drug hydrogen bonds (# Hbonds), and the number of atomic contacts (# atom contacts) with the drug molecule were used to verify the stability of all investigated models as well as the structural features of each complex. The H-bond interactions were calculated using two criteria: (i) distance between the hydrogen donor (HD) and acceptor (HA) of \u22643.5 \u00c5 and (ii) HD\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HA angle of \u2265150\u00b0. The # atom contacts were counted from the number of 3CL pro atoms within 3.5 \u00c5 of each drug. To evaluate the binding affinity and the key binding residues involved in ligand binding of the protein\u2212ligand complexes, the total binding free energy (\u0394G bind ) and per-residue decomposition free energy (\u0394G bind residue ) calculations based on molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2212Boltzmann (generalized Born) surface area [MM/PB(GB)SA] methods were performed on 100 MD snapshots extracted from the last 20 ns of the MD production phase. It should be noted that the protein\u2212ligand interactions and the binding free energies were carried out using the CPPTRAJ 37 and MMPBSA.py 38 modules of AMBER16, respectively. Furthermore, the intermolecular interactions between the drug and its binding residues at the atomic level were described by pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method at the secondorder M\u00f8ller\u2212Plesset perturbation energy and the 6-31G* level of theory (FMO-MP2/6-31G*) using GAMESS. 39 The solvation effect was also treated with a polarizable continuum model (PCM were higher than those of the lopinavir model (# H-bonds of 2 \u00b1 1 and # atom contacts of 14 \u00b1 4), suggesting that ritonavir was more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (discussed in more detail below). In this work, the MD trajectories from 80 to 100 ns were thus extracted for further analysis in terms of (i) the binding affinity between lopinavir or ritonavir and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , (ii) key binding residues involved in drug binding, (iii) protein\u2212drug H-bonding, and (iv) water accessibility at the enzyme active site. Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article Predicted Inhibitory Efficiency. The susceptibility of lopinavir and ritonavir to SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro was estimated using the MM/PB(GB)SA approach on 100 snapshots extracted from the last 20 ns of simulation. Note that the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA results in Table 1 provided a similar trend in the binding free energy predictions.",

This finding was in a good agreement with the \u0394E MM results of (i) these two anti-HIV drugs in complex with SARS-CoV 3CL pro15 and (ii) darunavir and amprenavir binding to the HIV-1 protease. 43 Taken together with the solvation effect and entropic term, the binding affinity (\u0394G bind ) of ritonavir with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (\u221214.93 \u00b1 1.83 and \u221227.78 \u00b1 1.82 kcal/mol taken from the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods, respectively) was relatively higher than that of another drug (\u221210.89 \u00b1 1.89 and \u221213.83 \u00b1 1.91 kcal/mol, respectively).

To evaluate the key residues involved in anti-HIV drug binding at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , the \u0394G bind residue calculation based on the MM/GBSA method was performed. The total energy contribution from each residue associated with drug binding of both complexes is plotted in Figure 3 , and the drug orientation in the enzyme active site is illustrated in the right panel, in which the contributing amino acids are colored according to their \u0394G bind residue values.

Similarly, it was reported that the SARS-CoV 3CL pro residues (i) M49 and M165 and (ii) E166 strongly stabilized PJ207, a quinazolinecontaining compound, mainly through hydrophobic interaction and H-bond formation, respectively. 44 In line with this finding, our \u0394G bind residue calculation showed that the phenyl ring at the P1 position of lopinavir and the thiazole ring at the P2 position of ritonavir were inserted into the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , forming hydrophobic contacts with residues M49 and M165 (Figure 3) , and the O 1 atom of ritonavir was stabilized by the -NH group of E166 via H-bond formation ( Figure 6 , discussed below).

However, there is a common concern about the drawbacks of the molecular mechanics calculations, in particular electronic properties. The FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* calculation was additionally performed on the last snapshot of each complex to investigate the protein\u2212drug interactions at the enzyme active site. The advantage of this method is known to include the electron correlation, which trustworthily describes the hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bond interaction between the ligand and individual residue. 40, 47, 48 Figure 6 highlights that Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article ritonavir binding with an energy stabilization of approximately \u221212 to \u221220 kcal/mol, whereas residues G143, S144, C145, and D187 showed less energy stabilization of approximately \u22125 to \u22127 kcal/mol, most likely through dispersion and electrostatic interactions, except for residue E166, for which the impact of the solvation effect was predominantly found on the two drugs binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . As compared to the recently reported potent \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor (13b) bound to SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , 49 the anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir lack (i) the P3 moiety, (ii) an \u03b1ketoamide group located between positions P1 and P1\u2032, and (iii) polar moieties on the phenyl ring in the P1 region. However, the phenyl ring at the P1\u2032 site of both HIV-1 protease inhibitors and 13b remains the same, and the P2 (larger and more hydrophilic than 13b) and P2\u2032 (found only in HIV-1 protease inhibitors) regions of lopinavir and ritonavir strongly interacted with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro at the S2 and S2\u2032 pockets, respectively ( Figure 3) . Accordingly, on the basis of this evidence, we proposed a rational design of novel protease inhibitor(s) derived from lopinavir and ritonavir to enhance the binding efficiency with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro as follows: (i) changing the phenyl ring in the P1 region to the \u03b3-lactam ring to increase the extent of Hbond formation with residues F140, H163, and E166, (ii) introducing P3 polar moieties (e.g., pyridone ring) to form Hbonds with the negatively charged E166, and (iii) adding the reactive \u03b1-ketoamide group located between positions P1 and P1\u2032 to covalently bond with the catalytic residue C145, as depicted in Figure 7 .",

To monitor such interaction, the percentages of H-bond occupations are plotted in Figure 8 , whereas the representative structures determined from the last MD snapshot are depicted in Figure 9 .

According to \u0394G bind prediction, the susceptibility against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro of ritonavir was somewhat higher than that of lopinavir, supported by energy stabilization from individual residues that resulted from both methods: (i) M49, M165, P168, and Q189 from MM/GBSA for lopinavir and L27, H41, M49, F140, N142, G143, H164, M165, and E166 from MM/GBSA for ritonavir and (ii) H41, A46, M49, E166, L167, L187, Q189, A191, and A193 from FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* for lopinavir and N142, G143, S144, C145, M165, E166, D187, and Q189 from FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* for ritonavir. In addition, the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 were found to interact with ritonavir via hydrogen bonds. From the FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* data, the electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer were considered as the important interactions for drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19 and how fundamental knowledge at the atomic level could also be helpful for the further design or development of more specific inhibitors in treating human coronaviruses.",
