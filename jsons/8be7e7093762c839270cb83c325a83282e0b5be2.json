Previous studies with vesicular stomatitis virus identified amino acid residues within the L protein domain VI required for mRNA cap methylation. In our recent study we analyzed four amino acid residues within domain VI of the Sendai virus L protein and our data indicated that there could be differences in L protein sequence requirements for cap methylation in two different families of Mononegaviralesrhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. In this study, we conducted a more comprehensive mutational analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI, creating twenty-four L mutants, and testing these mutations for their effects on viral mRNA synthesis, cap methylation, viral genome replication and virus growth kinetics. Our analysis identified several residues required for successful cap methylation and virus replication and clearly showed the importance of the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycinerich motif in the SeV cap methylation.

The caps are required for mRNA stability, and cap methylation, especially at G-N-7 position, is required for efficient mRNA translation (Gingras et al., 1999; Horikami et al., 1984; Horikami and Moyer, 1982) . The methyltransferase (MTase) activity was originally mapped to the L protein following the characterization of two vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, family Rhabdoviridae) host range (hr) mutants. These mutants exhibited severe defects in cap methylation (Horikami et al., 1984; Horikami and Moyer, 1982) , but this function was successfully complemented with purified wild type (wt) L protein in vitro, demonstrating that L possesses the viral mRNA MTase activities (Hercyk et al., 1988) . More recently, computational analyses predicted that the L protein domain VI has a typical 2\u2032-O MTase fold and identified a putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad and a glycine-rich motif (GxGxG) as the putative AdoMet binding site (Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2002; Ferron et al., 2002; Martin and McMillan, 2002) . These predictions were experimentally confirmed by several studies with the VSV L protein leading to the identification of the amino acid residues important for cap methylation within domain VI (Galloway et al., 2008; Grdzelishvili et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005 Li et al., , 2006 .

Further site-directed mutagenesis of the glycine-rich motif and putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad by Li et al. (2005 Li et al. ( , 2006 showed that they are important for mRNA cap methylation at both the G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions. Most of previous studies suggest that the L protein uses a single AdoMet binding site for both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O MTase activity, and that, at least in VSV, 2\u2032-O methylation precedes G-N-7 methylation (Rahmeh et al., 2009; Testa and Banerjee, 1977) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 310, "end": 332, "text": "(Gingras et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 333, "end": 355, "text": "Horikami et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 356, "end": 381, "text": "Horikami and Moyer, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 638, "end": 661, "text": "(Horikami et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 662, "end": 687, "text": "Horikami and Moyer, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 850, "end": 871, "text": "(Hercyk et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1132, "text": "(Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1153, "text": "Ferron et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1180, "text": "Martin and McMillan, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1400, "text": "(Galloway et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1428, "text": "Grdzelishvili et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1444, "text": "Li et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1462, "text": "Li et al., , 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1492, "text": "Grdzelishvili et al.

SeV produces mRNA that is capped and methylated at both the G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions (Takagi et al., 1995) , but interestingly, purified SeV L protein or just its C-terminal portion retaining domain VI, catalyzed only G-N-7, but not the 2\u2032-O cap methylation (Ogino et al., 2005) . In both VSV and SeV, alanine substitutions of the lysine upstream of the glycine-rich motif (also the first lysine of a putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad) led to cap methylation defects in these two viruses Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009 ). However, while alanine substitutions at the first two positions of the glycine-rich motif (G1804 and G1806) had little effect on MTase activity in SeV (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009) , in VSV the substitutions at the homologous glycine positions G1670 and G1672 affected cap methylation at either the G-N-7 or both the 2\u2032-O and G-N-7 positions . Studies with VSV also identified a region upstream of domain VI important for cap methylation (Grdzelishvili et al., 2006) . Interestingly, the recent study showed that VSV tolerates an insertion of GFP gene between domain VI and this upstream region, and a recombinant virus with such insertion showed a normal growth in cell culture but no virion-associated activity in vitro (Ruedas and Perrault, 2009 ). The upstream region has not been studied in SeV as there is no homology in this variable region between rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses, although the L protein of measles virus (a paramyxovirus) was also reported to tolerate GFP insertion in a region just upstream of domain VI (Duprex et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 356, "text": "(Takagi et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 508, "end": 528, "text": "(Ogino et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 738, "end": 768, "text": "Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 923, "end": 955, "text": "(Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1241, "text": "(Grdzelishvili et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1523, "text": "(Ruedas and Perrault, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1828, "text": "(Duprex et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To dissect the L protein sequence requirements for cap methylation in SeV in more detail, we conducted a more comprehensive analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI and created twenty-four L mutants by site-directed mutagenesis at highly conserved positions within this domain, using sequence conservation between L proteins in Mononegavirales as a guide (Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2002) .

In this work, we analyzed the entire domain VI of SeV in more detail, targeting the residues highly conserved in most members of the order Mononegavirales (Fig. 1 ). In addition to targeting the glycine-rich motif (the putative AdoMet binding site) and the putative catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E, which also is conserved in other known 2\u2032-O MTases including NS5 protein of flaviviruses ( Fig. 1) , we also targeted residues D1799 and Y1802 located just upstream of the glycine-rich motif and conserved only in some paramyxoviruses (Fig. 1 ). Many classes of MTases of known structure contain either a conserved aspartate or glutamate, or a tyrosine residue within the beta strand that precedes the conserved glycinerich motif, but rarely do they contain both these residues. A polar residue in this position has been implicated in reaction mechanism as the fifth catalytic entity (Kozbial and Mushegian, 2005) , and we were interested in determining whether one or both of these amino acids may play a functional role in SeV MTase. We also targeted the DKDK sequence located immediately upstream of the residue D1799. Although this DKDKD sequence is present only in some paramyxoviruses, we wanted to determine whether such high concentration of aspartates and lysines and its close proximity to the glycine-rich motif may play some role in cap methylation catalysis. In addition to single amino acid substitutions, several double and triple alanine substitutions were created, and the glycines within the glycine-rich motif were changed to leucines to address a possibility that this motif, while important for cap methylation in SeV, is more tolerant to single glycine-to-alanine substitutions as compared to VSV. All told, twentyfour L mutant genes were generated in the context of the pGEM-L vector with the L gene under control of the T7 promoter for their analysis using VVT7 system (see below). In addition, we cloned these mutations into a SeV full-length antigenomic plasmid, and we were able to generate 19 infectious SeV mutants using a reverse genetics system (Table 1) .

Infectious foci were visualized by crystal violet staining or IF at 48 or 72 h p.i. Several mutants behaved similarly to rWT, while some mutants had obvious defects in growth based on their inability to form visible infectious foci ( Fig. 2A) . All of the mutants with the substitutions between positions 1795 and 1800 (DKDKDR) were capable of forming visible infectious foci and grew to rWT-like titers ( Fig. 2A and Table 1 ). The rG1804A, rE1805A, rG1806A mutants and the double-mutant rG1804A/G1806A behaved as in our previous report (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009) , i.e., they showed similar growth to rWT. Even the rE1805A mutant, which had a slight delay in growth, still grew to high titers. Additional alanine mutants in or around glycine-rich motif behaved with minor variations: the rG1808A and especially the triple mutant rG1804A/G1806A/G1808A had smaller than rWT infectious foci, but grew to a high titer (1.4 \u00d7 10 8 CIU/ml), and the rY1802A mutant had small infectious foci 48 h p.i. but at 72 h p.i. had foci size and titer similar to rWT (Fig. 2B) . In contrast to these mutants, leucine substitutions had dramatic effect on virus growth: E1805L and G1808L could not be recovered despite all effort; rG1804L was dramatically attenuated in Vero cells and infectious foci could only be detected by IF (Fig. 2C) ; and rG1806L was severely attenuated in cell culture, and even after several passages on Vero cells, titers remained extremely low (b10 2 CIU/ml) ( Fig. 2C and Table 1 ). Thus, the GxGxG motif, which in the cases of homologous MTases with the known structure is invariably located in the loop between the first beta strand and the alpha helix of the Rossmann fold, tolerates substitutions to small side chain residue such as alanine, but the bulkier aliphatic side chain of leucine appears incompatible with the structure or function of this region.

Importantly, TAP treatment clearly resulted in the release of [ 3 H]-m 7 G from SeV mRNA produced by determent-activated virions in vitro, indicating that SeV mRNA was at least partially methylated at the G-N-7 position.

However, it would be premature to make this conclusion based solely on the TAP experiments. Thus, we did not observe a complete removal of [ 3 H]-m 7 G from the synthetic Cap 0 mRNA labeled only at G-N-7 position, indicating that under our experimental conditions TAP was only about 50% effective in hydrolyzing triphosphate bridges.

We also observed that two cap methylation defective mutants, rK1938S and rK1938A/I1939L, had strong interfering effect on replication of wt SeV during superinfection. Interestingly, another cap methylation defective mutant, rK1782A, did not interfere with rWT replication indicating that cap methylation defect alone is not sufficient for this dominant-negative mutant phenotype and that some additional factors are involved. Currently, we cannot explain how K1938S mutation could inhibit the growth of rWT and further studies are warranted to explore this interesting observation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 320, "text": "(Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, a single alanine substitution at the putative catalytic K1938 position was successfully introduced into plasmids containing the SeV L gene and the full-length antigenome of SeV. However, when infectious virus particles, recovered using a reverse genetics system, were sequenced, the substitution was to serine rather than alanine. Based on the importance of this position in the catalytic tetrad, we speculate that the change to the polar serine residue led to a more favorable configuration of hydrogen bond network linking catalytic residues to AdoMet and perhaps additionally supporting proper conformation of the L protein, which may be important for its function. When tested in a VV-T7 in vitro transcription or replication systems, the K1938A mutant L had slightly lower transcription (\u223c80%) and lower replication levels (\u223c60%) as compared to rWT. Mutant virions with the K1938S substitution were defective in cap methylation (8% of rWT), but had high transcription levels (91% of rWT): apparently, a serine substitution is more favorable for the overall activity of the L protein (although not necessarily for cap methylation).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A better understanding of the biology of these SeV L mutants could lead to the rational design of live attenuated viruses and their use as vaccine, oncolytic and gene therapy vectors based on different members of Mononegavirales.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "African green monkey (Vero, ATCC# CCL-81), human lung carcinoma (A549, ATCC# CCL-185) and BSR-T7/5 cells [derived from baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells that constitutively express bacteriophage T7 polymerase (Buchholz et al., 1999) ] were used for virus infections and plasmid transfections.

Titration was done on 6-well plates (C) with the rWT infection foci visualized 48 h p.i. using 4 CN Peroxidase Substrate staining Kit (KPL) and anti-SeV primary antibodies. Representative plates are shown. Only large SeV rWT (but not mutant) infectious foci are visible at this time point.

To make synthetic mRNA containing Cap 0, uncapped mRNA transcripts were capped and G-N-7 methylated in the presence of 1.75 \u03bcM [ 3 H]AdoMet using the ScriptCap m 7 G Capping System (Epicentre Biotechnologies) based upon the tri-functional vaccinia virus capping enzyme, and purified using Spin-50 Sephadex G-50 mini-columns (USA Scientific). To make synthetic mRNA with Cap 1 but [ 3 H]-labeled only at the 2\u2032-O position, uncapped mRNA transcripts were first capped in the presence of 100 \u03bcM cold AdoMet using the ScriptCap m 7 G Capping System to make mRNA with the unlabeled Cap 0 structure (which is the template for 2\u2032-O methylation by the vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase). After purification using Spin-50 Sephadex G-50 mini-columns, the unlabeled Cap 0 mRNA was 2\u2032-O methylated in the presence of 1.75 \u03bcM [ 3 H]AdoMet using ScriptCap 2\u2032-O MTase (Epicentre Biotechnologies) based upon the vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase, and purified again using Spin-50 Sephadex G-50 minicolumns.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Cap methylation analysis using SeV detergent-activated purified virions.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "(described in detail in Materials and methods): i) [ 3 H]-AdoMet labeled VSV mRNA generated using detergent-activated wt VSV virions using in vitro transcription conditions identical to SeV; ii) synthetic SeV NP mRNA containing Cap 0 (m 7 GpppA...) structure labeled with [ 3 H] at the G-N-7 position, and iii) synthetic SeV NP mRNA containing Cap 1 structure (m 7 Gppp[m 2\u2032-O ]A...) labeled with [ 3 H]-AdoMet only at the 2\u2032-O position (2\u2032-O methylated by the vaccinia virus enzyme).
