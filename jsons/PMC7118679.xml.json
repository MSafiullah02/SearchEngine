The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. After the lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, the Taiwanese government planned to evacuate its citizens from the area by means of chartered flights. Out of the 47 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Taiwan by March 10 2020, 21 were imported. A detailed evacuation workflow was planned in order to minimize the possibility of surface environmental contamination1 - Preflight: (1) Equipment/facilities. (2) Regulation/communication. (3) Training/drills. Upon arrival at Wuhan airport: (1) Quarantine certification. (2) Self-report medical declaration. (3) Physical evaluation. Boarding: (1) Disinfection. (2) Protective clothing. (3) Boarding priority/seat arrangement. (Fig. 1\n) Inflight: (1) No inflight service. (2) Waste handling. (3) Monitor/seat-rearrangement. Upon arrival at Taiwan airport: (1) Disembark order. (2) Transport/self-health management.",

The next group to board was the red group, and finally the green. Two seats were left vacant between each passenger. During the flight, people were asked not to talk to each other, and not to consume food and drinks. Leaving their seats to go to the toilet was not allowed. Evacuees were advised to inform the medical staff if they experienced any discomfort. After landing in Taiwan, all evacuees were examined again. The throat swab samples were collected and underwent real-time polymerase-chain-reaction test by the local quarantine officers before being transported separately to designated dormitories for 14 days of self-quarantine. All of 361 evacuees were proved to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection later.",

We hope to share certain insights derived by the Taiwanese medical team during the execution of our evacuation. Our experience was limited to a short-haul flight \u2013 it takes around 3 h to travel from Wuhan to Taiwan. For flights of longer duration, there needs to be allowances made for food, beverage, and toileting needs.3 Indeed, given the restrictions imposed during the flight, certain high-risk populations, for example people who are prone to developing deep venous thrombosis or neuropsychiatric-related conditions,4 may require special precautions or medical attention. Another limitation was our workflow could not show preventive efficacy for environmental contamination or diseases transmission for SARS-CoV-2 infected evacuees. In addition, an isolation unit should be considered for in-flight emergencies or isolation.3\n,\n5\n",
