Graph embedding methods [6, 7, 13, 16] have been proposed as an effective way of learning low-dimensional representations for nodes to enable down-stream machine learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification, on these complex graph data. Most existing graph embedding methods learn node embeddings from graph topological structure only [6, 13, 16, 17]. However, nodes in a graph usually have supplementary attribute information which can be utilized in graph embedding along with the graph structure to produce more meaningful node embeddings [7, 11, 15, 21].",

For example, most knowledge graphs follow the \u201cOpen World Assumption\u201d [14] (i.e. the unobserved edges are unknown instead of untrue), so that graph structures are far from complete and many edges are missing. Also, much attribute information is abstracted from free text (e.g. users\u2019 post on social media) and is usually imprecise or ambiguous due to the limitations in data sources or abstraction tools.

Recently, several studies have been proposed to model the uncertainty present in graph data [1, 8, 11, 20]. Most of these work, including VGAE [11], and Graph2Gauss [1], focuses on modelling the uncertainty of the node embeddings by representing the nodes with a probabilistic distribution in the embedding space. Since these studies attempts to preserve the observable graph structural proximity by measuring the distance between probability distribution embeddings, uncertainty modelling of these methods can only capture structure noise. Therefore, they do not explicitly account for the node attribute noise which is common in the real-world graphs.",

RASE learns robust node representations via carefully-designed strategies, exploiting both graph structure and node attributes simultaneously. Attribute noise is modelled with a denoising attribute auto-encoder to maintain the discreteness and sparseness of textual data by introducing a noise in the input through a binomial distribution. Structure noise is modelled in the latent layer by modelling the embeddings as Gaussian distributions. To preserve the transitivity in the embedding space with a linear computational cost, 2-Wasserstein distance is used as the similarity measure between the distributions in Gaussian space. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five different real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating effective embeddings for node classification and link prediction. Moreover, we introduce a novel experimental setting to simulate random structure noise and random attribute noise to demonstrate the robustness of our model in embedding noisy graphs.",

TADW [19] incorporates text attributes and graph structure with low-rank matrix factorization. GraphSAGE [7] is a CNN-based technique that samples and aggregates neighbouring node attributes. Graph2Gauss [1] finds the neighbours in each hop up to a pre-defined number of hops which is space inefficient. Also, it uses node attributes for embedding initialization and does not explicitly preserve attributes when learning embeddings. VGAE [11] is a graph convolution network (GCN) method, which aggregates neighbouring attributes. In most studies, node attributes are only used for embedding initialization, but not during model training. DANE [4] proposes a deep non-linear architecture to preserve both aspects.",

In contrast, though DVNE, VGAE and G2G also model uncertainty in the embeddings, their performance degradation is quite significant (7.4%, 6.5% and 14.3% in AUC respectively) when the noise ratio is increased from 0% to 50%. VGAE is based on GCN, which aggregates the neighbouring attributes into a convex embedding. Thus, it is heavily affected by noisy neighbours, as errors get further exaggerated. The hop-based structural ranking in G2G is sensitive to false neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the square-exponential loss function used for pair-wise ranking in both G2G and DVNE does not have a fixed margin and pushes the distance of the negative edges to infinity with an exponentially decreasing force [1]. Hence, these methods are highly sensitive to erroneous and missing edges. In contrast, RASE is mildly affected due to its carefully designed structural loss function and the extra information learned from the neighbourhood via the transitivity property of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$W_2$$\\end{document} metric.\n",

Moreover, RASE only shows a 3.3% degradation in micro-F1, when we increase the proportion of corrupted nodes from 0% to 50%. The small degradation can be attributed to the node attribute denoising step. RASE also outperforms its non-robust counterpart, showing the effectiveness of attribute noise modelling component. GraphSAGE shows a poorer node classification performance when compared to others, which shows that noisy attributes has misled the model to learn inexact node embeddings. Negative effect of noisy attributes of neighbouring nodes in GCN\u2019s aggregation step causes the lower performance of VGAE when its performance is compared against RASE and G2G. Overall, G2G shows a modest micro-F1 decline (i.e. 4.9% from 0% to 50%), since the Gaussian node embeddings have captured the attribute uncertainty via the variance terms.\n",
