The high population density of the country exacerbates human-transmission of diseases like influenza and has been considered a potential \u201chot-spot\u201d for disease outbreaks. This was indeed the case in 2003 when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was brought to Singapore by residents returning from overseas resulting in 238 infection cases and 33 deaths [10]. Later in 2009, 11% of the Singapore population were estimated to be infected with the H1N1 influenza virus in the first 10 weeks after the epidemic began in the United States [11]. Recent proposed changes to the Infectious Diseases Act to turn away unvaccinated travelers to Singapore [12] signal awareness from authorities to protect residents from foreign disease vectors. However, adequate influenza prevention requires substantial herd immunity fostered through individuals\u2019 uptake of the seasonal vaccine. Unfortunately, experts\u2019 recognition of the value of vaccines as an effective preventive tool may not be shared equally by the public. This sentiment toward vaccines is reflected in low immunization rates as Gan [13] reports that \u201cadult vaccination rates in Singapore generally hover at below 20 percent\u201d and \u201cbelow 10 percent for those aged 50 to 69\u201d [14]. Given that disease incidence rates could be reduced with increased vaccine uptake [15], nonvaccination against infectious diseases could instead pose risks of viral spread, increasing the probability of disease outbreaks.",

In 2006, Chow and colleagues [19] noted that influenza-associated deaths in Singapore between 1996 and 2003 were the highest among older adults aged 65 and above and further estimated that the yearly vaccine uptake rate among the elderly population is not greater than eight percent. More recent figures from the 2013 National Health Surveillance Survey also revealed that influenza vaccination coverage among Singaporeans aged 50 and above ranged from 14% to 20% [20].",

Among older adults in Singapore, the most common second language used is Mandarin Chinese. Thus, all interviewers in our project had to be bilingual and conversant in English and Mandarin Chinese. While interviews were conducted primarily in English, our project team anticipated short usage of Mandarin Chinese by our participants and were trained to conduct member checks [28]. In such cases where a participant used terms or phrases in Mandarin, our interviewers conducted member checks in both English and Mandarin to best match nuances in language use. Participants were compensated with either 20 Singapore Dollars (approximately 15 US Dollars) cash or gift voucher at the end of the interviews. 76 participants who conformed to our inclusion criteria completed the interview, thus providing a robust sample and dataset from to allow for greater descriptive findings and saturation.",

Interviewers were trained to reflect upon the interviews and provided insights on participants\u2019 health misperceptions, personal background, health information seeking, vaccine information access, influenza perceptions, vaccination intentions, vaccine perceptions, social norms, nonverbal behaviors, and any other issues or outcomes from the interview. During this post-interview reflection, the researchers turned back to the audio recording as needed to amend and revise their observations. They also identified and transcribed any direct illustrative quotes from the participants and included them in their field notes while using the raw audio files to corroborate and identify any discrepancies. This approach has been noted to help minimize interviewer bias and improve cross-case comparisons following the documentation of findings [31]. Neither the field notes nor the findings were returned to the participants for comments and corrections.",

Older adults face significant challenges concerning memory recall of knowledge-based appeals, and this is exacerbated by age as linear declines in fluency, memory, and perceptual speed are observed as people grow older [46]. Older adults also tend to heuristically process complex information such as those related to health as their cognitive abilities decline with age [46]. Finucane [47] pointed out that older adults are inclined to rely more on emotion-evoking information and suggested that risk information may be portrayed with numeric displays, visuals and in narratives to enhance likelihood of message processing and increase message salience among older audiences. Orel, Spence, and Steele [48] proposed providing factual information to counteract misperceptions and discussing old age vulnerabilities to increase perceived disease susceptibility. Cummings [46] added that written instructions should be accompanied with verbal consultations with healthcare professionals to ensure message comprehension. Message tailoring to older audiences has also been recognized as an effective strategy in increasing information salience and can contribute to reducing information exposure barriers [49]. These recommendations can be incorporated into future communication to improve knowledge about influenza. Sparks and Nussbaum [50] suggested tailoring interpersonal messages to older adults\u2019 personal characteristics and information processing abilities to improve health knowledge. While their recommendation was oriented toward older cancer patients, this advice is not any less useful for encouraging vaccination among older adults now that this group\u2019s primary misperceptions about the influenza disease have been systematically identified in this study.",

News headlines commonly reiterate to get vaccinated when \u201ctravelling for your year-end holiday\u201d or before beginning \u201cstudies overseas\u201d [13]. While laudable advice, such stories may implicitly contribute to a perpetuated misperception that vaccines including those against influenza should be taken only before traveling and not as routine practice.
