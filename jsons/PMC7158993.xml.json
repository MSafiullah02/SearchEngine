A meta-analysis6 showed that urinary detection of L pneumophila had a pooled sensitivity of 0\u00b774 and a specificity of 0\u00b799. Urinary detection of S pneumoniae had a specificity of 0\u00b796 and positive predictive value of 0\u00b788\u20130\u00b796, allowing clinicians to use a narrower spectrum of antibiotics.7 Rapid antigen detection of the influenza virus in nasal or pharyngeal swabs (done in 30 min) has a low sensitivity of less than 0\u00b760; sensitivity correlates with viral load.8 However, specificity is around 1\u00b700, resulting in a positive predictive value of more than 0\u00b798\u2014high enough to make a positive result reliable for medical decisions. A negative result does not rule out the presumptive diagnosis of the physician, which should be checked by a second-line molecular test in a core laboratory.",

However, a liquid direct fluorescent antibody format (Fast-Point; Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA) is available for POC testing (appendix). It has not been approved by the FDA or the CE, but detects influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus in 25 min. The latest generation real-time PCR kits can complete molecular testing of swabs for bacterial and viral pathogens in 60 min.9 New generation real-time PCR kits are typically multiplexed assays testing as many as 22 potential pathogens in parallel.9 This new capacity of POC tests increases the number of diagnoses11 and underscores that community-acquired pneumonia can result from co-infection with several pathogens,10 which will challenge common notions about causation and management. For example, we propose that influenza and S pneumoniae have to be tested for in parallel irrespective of which one is the presumed causative pathogen. Furthermore, detection by POC testing of an abnormal increase in group A streptococci might suggest co-infection with influenza.11 Procalcitonin concentrations greater than 0\u00b75 ng/mL suggest bacterial co-infection in influenza\u2014a major risk factor for death.",
