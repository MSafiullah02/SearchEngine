Because patients in disaster areas require critical care, a robust frontline workforce is needed; thus, mobilising hospital nurses in response to disasters has become a pivotal strategy. However, hospital nurses might not feel ready and be available to care for patients during disasters despite their pre-deployment experiences with trauma, wound care, infection control or perioperative care (Evans and Baumberger-Henry, 2014). Given the importance of disaster-nursing training programmes, nurse educators and administrators have a critical need to understand how well prepared hospital nurses are to provide disaster care. To address this need, therefore, this study assessed hospital nurses' readiness for responses to disasters outside the hospital environment and identified factors influencing their disaster-readiness knowledge, skills and attitudes in Taiwan.",

The 44-item EPIQ examines nurses' familiarity with eight dimensions of emergency preparedness (Wisniewski et al., 2004). The 61-item READI was developed to assess US military nurses' readiness before providing care in a war or austere environment (Reineck et al., 2001). The 68-item DEPT was based on suggestions from the American Association of Colleagues of Nursing's Essentials of Master's Education and assesses nurse practitioners' disaster knowledge and skills (Al Khalaileh et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2015). These three instruments were used by the research team to draft a 66-item questionnaire.",

Furthermore, we found that preparing oneself to work with an unfamiliar multi-disciplinary team was one of the items in this domain significantly associated with disaster-response readiness. This finding is a matter of concern since the ability of response teams to remain effective in a dynamic disaster environment was shown to depend on trust relationships, open communication and group cohesion (Davis et al., 2007). These findings highlight the importance of providing inter-professional practice training to hospital nurses to ensure that they are well prepared in responding to disasters.",

Our results differ from a US report suggesting that Wisconsin nurses were familiar with triage and basic first-aid issues, as their mean EPIQ score was 3.15 out of 5 (Wisniewski et al., 2004). The different emergency-response capabilities may be due to different continuing education programmes in the two study samples. For example, the experiences of Chinese nurses who had been dispatched to earthquake sites support the need to equip nurses with such essential emergency nursing skills before responding to a disaster (Yan et al., 2015). Indeed, we confirmed that nurses with emergency/intensive nursing care experience reported higher scores in emergency response. Taken together, these findings suggest that hospital nurses with better emergency or intensive care nursing skills are more likely to have greater readiness for disaster responses.",

These findings are notable since concerns about personal safety and personal protective equipment were identified in a systematic review as significant factors in deciding to report for work in a disaster (Chaffee, 2009).

Similar results were found in surveys of US paediatric nurse practitioners (Goodhue et al., 2012) as well as military and government hospital nurses in Saudi Arabia (Al Thobaity et al., 2015).

In contrast, hospital nurses with disaster relief experience exhibited better scores than nurses without deployment experience, but the critical issue of maintaining their disaster-response competencies should be explored in future research. Therefore, nurse educators should provide nurses with all-hazard disaster training, so that nurses feel prepared to respond to natural or man-made disasters. Most important, given different cultural and language needs, nurses in different countries might face specific challenges. Thus, our findings not only address a national issue in assessing disaster readiness, but also warrant further study to improve hospital nurses' disaster response readiness in Taiwan and other countries.",

In addition, the study instrument was self-administered, so that self-reports of predicted nursing performance could differ from actual nursing performance. Therefore, we suggest that future studies confirm nurses'judgement by objectively measuring their performance in disaster simulations.
