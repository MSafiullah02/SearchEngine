The samples were tested by an enzyme-linked immuncxx&ent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of rotavirus antigen. Of 402 daily calves tested, 28 (7.0%) were positive, of which 21 (7.2%) were from diarrhoeic calves and 7 (6.3%) from non-diarrhoeic calves. Rotavirus infection varied from farm to farm (2.7-9.2%) and there was no positive response from any of the 32 village calves. Rotavirus was most commonly found in calves of 1 week of age or less (up to 22.2% in one group) but was not found in any cah~ later than 6 months of age. More than 80% of rotavirus-positive samples from diarrhoeic calves exhibited a titre of 128 or more (geometric mean 34.5+4.5), whereas nondiarrhoeal caives had titres less than or equal to 128 (geometric mean = 29?1.9), suggesting that rotavinas infection in calves in Bangladesh was mostly associated with diarrhoea.",

The role of the virus in causing diarrhoea, especially in young subjects, is well established (Mebus et al., 1%9; Woode and Crouch, 1978; Castrucci et al., 1988) . Although rotavirus infection in diarrhoeic calves usually involves multiple enteropathogens including Escherichiu cob, corona virus, and/or cryptosporidia (Morin et al, 1978) , single infections are not uncommon (Tzipori, 1981) . In calves, the infection is mostly associated with diarrhoea, sometimes as the primary agent, in naturally infected and experimentaIly produced cases (Mebus et al., 1%9; Woode and Crouch, 1978) and the infection varies widely depending on various factors (McNulty, 1978; Tzipori, 1981) . Calf diarrhoea (gastroenteritis syndrome) remains the most often reported clinical problem in calf management and in rural conventional cattle rearing systems in Bangladesh (Debnath et al., 1990) . This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of rotavirus infection in selected dairy farms and in conventionally reared village calves in Bangladesh, and to study the prevalence of rotavirus in diarrhoeic and age matched non-diarrhoeic calves.",

The equivalent calf population in the village could not be ascertained but was estimated to be around SO. Calves on farms A and B were Holstein crossed (Fl) with either Sindi, Sahiwal (tropical breeds) or local improved nondescript Zebu. Farm C calves were cross breeds between Sindi and Sahiwal, while most calves of the village were improved Zebu crossed with Sindi or Sahiwal. All the calves were grouped as diarrhoeic (D), having clinical diarrhoea with liquid or semi-liquid faeces, or non-diarrhoeic (N), without any abnormal fluidity of the faeces, regardless of any previous history of illness. All the calves were further categorized into four groups on the basis of age: group I, calves from birth up to 1 week of age; group II, from over 1 week to 1 month old calves; group III, calves aged over 1 month to 6 months; and group IV, calves from over 6 months to 1 year old.",

Each farm calf was bottle-fed colostrum and natural milk from their dams soon after birth, usually within 24 hours. Sick calves were usually transferred to a separate calf shed in all the dairies. The village calves were reared in the conventional way for backyard rearing systems in Bangladesh. Most farmers in the village had 2-10 cattle, the cows being used for dual purposes, i.e. draught power and milk. Their calves receive milk naturally by sucking from their respective dams. These calves usually received sufficient colostrum and milk, and occasionally roamed freely in the small grazing fields.",

A 7.22% infection of diarrhoeic calves as detected in the present study appears low in comparison with fmdings elsewhere (de Leeuw et aZ., 1980; Moerman et aZ., 1982 , Bellinzoni et uZ., 1987 . Rotavirus infection may vary widely from place to place or even from farm to farm (Tzipori, 1981) . Our findings, however, show similarity with limited observations (Debnath et al., 1987) in the area of Dhaka in diarrhoeic calves up to 1 month old. The variation in the rate of infection on different farms (p=O.O9) needs more investigation before reaching any firm conclusions. Hygiene measurement is one of the important factors, along with other interacting variables (Tzipori, 1981) . Farm B, which had the lowest prevalence (2.73%) of the virus differed significantly (p=O.O5) from farm A and was noted to have a better cleaning and disinfecting procedure than the other two farms. A higher infection rate (Table II) in the first week of life suggests widespread rotavirus in this group of younger calves. Other studies (Acres and Babiuk, 1978; de Leeuw et al., 1980) showed similar results. In farm C, infection in the non-diarrhoeic calves was relatively high (Table I) . Subclinical infection is not uncommon on premises where clinical infection occurs in calves (de Leeuw et al., 1980, Snodgrass and Sherwood, 1983) . The overall infection rate in non-diarrhoeic calves in this study corresponds with some other reports (Bellinzoni et al., 1987) . As numerous factors (Tzipori, 1981) interplay in precipitating clinical diarrhoea, it is difficult to make absolute conclusions based on the limited information we have. However, rotavirus infection has been shown to be more important than other agents in diarrhoea in young calves of around 1 week of age (4-14 days) (de Leeuw et al., 1980) . Although our findings did not reveal a significant difference in rotavirus infection between diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic calves, rotavirus was mostly associated (p =O.l) with young diarrhoeic calves.",
