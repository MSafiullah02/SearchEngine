Syndemic theory provides a useful framework for understanding how such interacting epidemics to develop under conditions of health and social disparity. Multiple historical and present-day factors have created the syndemic conditions within which Black Americans experience the lethal force of COVID-19. These factors include racism and its manifestations (e.g., chattel slavery, mortgage redlining, political gerrymandering, lack of Medicaid expansion, employment discrimination, and healthcare provider bias). Improving racial disparities in COVID-19 will require that we implement policies that address structural racism at the root of these disparities.",

The burden is most pronounced for Black Americans who make up 13% of the U.S. population but 30% of COVID-19 cases in the 14 states for which racial data were available [1] . Rates of exposure and infection with the novel pathogen may also differ by race; however, the lack of widespread testing and limited reporting of racial data make this difficult to ascertain. A variety of explanations have been offered for this emerging health inequity: Black Americans experience a higher prevalence of underlying chronic conditions, such as hypertension (57%) [2] , diabetes (18%) [3] , and obesity (50%) [4] , which predispose individuals to poorer clinical outcomes, including death, in the event of COVID-19 disease [5] . Black Americans are 1.5 times more likely to be underinsured or lack health insurance altogether than Whites [6] , contributing to delayed access to lifesaving care [7] . On April 17 th , 2020, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams even suggested Black Americans have higher substance use rates and recommended they reduce substance use, alcohol consumption and smoking to prevent COVID-19 deaths [8] . While these factors may play a role in why Black American communities face greater losses in this pandemic, decades of research to understand the disproportionate burden of HIV among Black Americans may help unmask the drivers of this inequity and improve efforts to mitigate it.",

One analysis found six-fold higher rates of COVID-19 testing in high-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia despite higher COVID-19 positive tests in poorer Black neighborhoods [16] . Such inequities are magnified by medical provider bias. A long legacy of medical mistreatment, present day racial bias in clinical decisionmaking, and minimization of Black American patients' symptoms impact access to health technologies [17] .

The preponderance of Black Americans in occupations, environments, and situations that increase exposure to the novel coronavirus is not accidental but grounded in the historical and modern-day structural violence of racism. Racism is a form of structural violence because it produces socially unjust conditions that predispose Black communities to disability and death-a reality that is both normalized and reproduced within the practices and policies of enduring public and private institutions [23] .

Counties with the greatest share of votes for Trump in the 2016 election were least likely to practice social distancing, and the greater the share of residents who denied climate change, the worse the county scored on social distancing [26] . Repudiation of science related to both climate change and COVID-19 is encouraged by the Trump administration; and both have disproportionate impacts on Black communities [27] [28] [29] . Resistance to climate change and Trump support are both high among white people in the southern United States [30, 31] , and it is no coincidence that the push to suspend stay-at-home orders and to prematurely re-open economies are being led by governors of southern states (e.g. Georgia, Texas, South Carolina).",

Improving reporting of race in surveillance and screening programs is an essential step to ensure disparities are accurately tracked. However, we do not need to wait for surveillance programs to act. The pattern is clear. To address these disparities in the short-term, we must compensate low wage service workers who have not had the option to stay at home and have kept our society functioning through this devastating pandemic. We must push for a living wage for all workers; provide universal healthcare access that is not tethered to employment or income; and demand personal protective equipment, access to testing, paid sick leave, and other basic minimums for essential workers who face life-threatening occupational exposures. While important, these actions are insufficient to address the inequities rooted in syndemic conditions.",

The racial health inequities that we are seeing have not emerged randomly nor passively; rather, they are actively produced through anti-Black racism institutionalized within the American political system. The field of epidemiology must now reckon with a heightened awareness that the system of racism is more than a passive backdrop; it is a dynamic functioning epidemic that has converged with the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate exposure, disease, and mortality among Black people in America. While science endeavors to remain non-partisan, its effectiveness in protecting the health of populations will be minimized if it is silent on the influence of politics on the disproportionate rates of illness and death experienced by Black people in this country. Our scientific approach to addressing drivers of these inequities must change in response to our awareness of systemic racism. The timeframe for change is up to us.
