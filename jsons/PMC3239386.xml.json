The mortality rate was 38% in patients given 'protective' ventilation (PEEP above the lower inflection point on the static pressure\u2013volume curve, tidal volume <6 ml/kg ideal body weight, driving pressures <20 cmH2O above the PEEP value, permissive hypercapnia, and preferential use of pressure-limited ventilatory modes) compared with 71% in patients on conventional ventilation (P < 0.001). This impressive reduction in mortality was tempered by the higher than normal mortality level in the control group, prompting the National Institutes of Health-funded Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network to set up a similar, larger (861 patients), prospective, multicenter, randomized trial in the US [21].",

Relative adrenal insufficiency is common in patients with refractory septic shock (50\u201375% of patients) [39]. In addition to such relative adrenal insufficiency and the blunted response to corticotrophin, a large body of evidence indicates that sepsis and refractory septic shock are characterized by peripheral tissue resistance to corticosteroids [40,41]. In septic patients, this can be evidenced in a variety of ways. First, global cortisol binding, which carries cortisol from the adrenal glands to the tissues, decreases in patients with severe sepsis [42]. Second, the number and binding affinity of glucocorticosteroid receptors may be reduced in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis [43], leading to a decrease in the conversion of cortisone to its active form, cortisol, particularly by IL-2 levels in the tissues. Finally, data have been published demonstrating that moderate doses of steroids may restore cell sensitivity to vasopressors [44]. This may reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response and decrease organ dysfunction. Low-dose steroid treatment is also well tolerated [40].",
