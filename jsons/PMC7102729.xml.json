To support simulation development, we hired a current Master of Public Health (MPH) student (H.O.) to be the lead author and lead facilitator of the simulation.

Assignments are released and submitted through the courseware platform. Each assignment includes a memo (see example memo, Figure 1) from the protagonist to the nurse interns requesting an analysis, report, or other deliverable. To simulate the real-time, rapid pace of an outbreak investigation, memos and assignments are released only as teams submit prior assignments. Memos alert teams to recent developments in the investigation (e.g., new cases, laboratory confirmation, etc.), and the assignments require students to respond to the outbreak as it unfolds. Assignments are all team based; there are no individual assignments in the simulation. At the end of the simulation, the lead author/protagonist delivers a brief lecture on the SARS outbreak in Canada, and the students are given the opportunity to debrief and reflect on the simulation experience and complete an evaluation. The debriefing is facilitated by the course instructor who asks the students to share their experiences and to discuss aspects of the simulation they found challenging or surprising. Debriefing sessions last approximately 15-20 minutes. Comprehensive feedback is also provided to student teams later through assessment and grading of deliverables.",

The course instructor and the TA met before the simulation to discuss the rubric and describe scenarios consistent with each score. To further minimize bias, groups were assessed multiple times throughout the simulation and received the average score from all observations. Based on student feedback, role conflict when facilitators were also asked to assess group functioning, and constraints on the amount of time facilitators could spend with each simulation group, we transitioned this assessment component from faculty to the students beginning in summer 2015, using a peer evaluation point allocation system developed at the University of Buffalo National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (Evaluating Student Case Work, 2015). The average peer participation grade was 9.9/10 (range, 8.0-10.6).

In our case, an MPH student was hired as a lead author of the simulation, with substantial involvement from course instructors. Implementation of the simulation requires at a minimum two facilitators; additional facilitation is warranted if the class size is large. Ideally, facilitators are teaching assistants or course staff who know both the simulation content and the students well. Some background in epidemiology and public health is helpful to answer questions about, for example, calculating attack rates and case fatality rates or interpreting an epidemic curve. If the simulation is staffed at a minimal level, a detailed instructor manual and use of a courseware discussion board during the simulation can help. Grading the simulation is also time consuming given the number of assignments and, in a large class, the number of teams. We shifted part of the grading burden to students by having them assess peer participation.",

For example, in some groups, each student had a laptop and worked independently. In groups where not every student had a laptop, subgroups were formed with two to three students working together on one laptop with more discussion and verbal communication. In breakout rooms with a large projection screen, students often projected work in progress from a shared Google document so that the full group could contribute. These groups demonstrated the most engagement and spent the least amount of time collating and submitting assignments.",

We debated rewriting the simulation to focus on the Ebola outbreak to capitalize on this timelines and salience. However, we quickly deemed this unfeasible given the resources needed to develop a new, high-fidelity simulation. We did mention the Ebola outbreak during debrief and linked the outbreak investigation skills needed in West Africa to the tasks and assignments the students had just completed in the simulation. We noted that student interest and engagement in the simulation was highest in fall 2014 compared with other semesters, with more students mentioning the relevance of the materials in evaluation forms.",

The lead author then served as a lead facilitator in fall 2014 and summer 2015, but we have set an explicit goal for the Course Director, Associate Course Director, and Course Instructor to be comfortable running the simulation going forward. To ensure longevity and sustainability of the simulation without compromising its validity or pedagogical value, we plan to recruit epidemiology and nursing doctoral students to join the simulation team as facilitators, expand the existing instructor manual with detailed step-by-step instructions for simulation delivery to facilitate course faculty's ability to run the simulation with confidence and ease, and transition the lead facilitator role to permanent course faculty over the next year.",

We will continue to view simulation development as an iterative process and revise it to address student feedback and the realities of class size and available time. In response to overwhelming student feedback, the next major revision we will undertake is to change the courseware settings so that teams can move through the simulation at their own pace. We are sensitive to the fact that this may diminish the \u201creal time\u201d feel of the simulation which may alter the students' overall experience in an outbreak investigation simulation. At the same time, we believe a self-paced version will facilitate implementation.
