However, the same fetus if born premature and admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), gets subjected to harmful radiations for diagnostic evaluations. As the quality of neonatal care is improving, more and more sick premature babies with complex medical conditions are now surviving. By the end of their extended NICU stays, the doses of ionizing radiation to these neonates may accumulate quickly.",

Prospective data was collected on various radiologic examinations performed for different indications during the study period. Standard Radiographic settings were used for different radiographic procedures. Conventional radiography with digital image plate was used. For Chest Radiograph, tube voltage of 65 KV, current of 0.6 mA and film to tube distance of 90 cms was used. For abdominal examination, voltage 65\u201370 KV and 0.6 mA current and for infantogram 50 KV voltage and 0.5 mA current was used. Entrance skin dose (ESD) measurement for each patient during each radiographic procedure was technically and organizationally impractical, so standard reference dose of radiation in microsievert (\u03bcsv) for each radiologic examination under NICU conditions was taken from reference ranges published by Puch-Kapst and colleagues, and for CT examinations from Huda and Vance [2, 3]. Standard reference dose used were for Babygram 23.8 microSv, Chest X-ray 14.4 microSv and for Abdominal X-ray/ umbilical venous catheter (UVC)/ umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) 17.8 microSv [2]. Effective dose of radiation exposure for a baby was calculated by adding doses from multiple examinations [1].",
