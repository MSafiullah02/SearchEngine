Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large intercase variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M 2 UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M 2 UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation subnetwork for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification subnetwork for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve",

Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods. golden standard for COVID-19 is the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, the effectiveness of those imaging-base applications is limited. Moreover, approximately 80% of patients with COVID-19 have only mild to moderate symptoms [9] , while the remaining patients have severe symptoms. Based on previous studies [5] , [10] , the imaging-based characters of COVID-19 patients are distinct to related diseases, e.g., viral pneumonia. Therefore, the severity assessment of the disease is of high clinical value, which helps effectively allocate medical resources such as ventilator. Among various radiological examinations, chest CT imaging plays an essential role in fighting this infectious disease by helping early identify lung infections and assess the severity of the disease. Previous studies show that computed tomography (CT) has the ability to provide valuable information in the screening and diagnosis [10] . In this work, CT help the clinicians to evaluate the condition of the patients in advance, by which necessary measures or treatments could better proceed, especially for severe patients in time.",

Specifically, considering that only a few slices in CT images are related to severity assessment, each input CT image is represented by a bag of 2D image patches, each of which is randomly cropped from a specific slice.

Also, several variants of U-Net have been applied to the diagnosis or severity assessment of COVID-19. Jin et al . [6] design a two-stage pipeline to screen COVID-19 in CT images, and they utilize U-Net++ [17] to detect the whole lung region and to separate lesions from lung regions. Besides, V-Net [18] is also used in various segmentation applications. Shan et al . [5] integrates human-in-the-loop strategy into the training process of VB-Net (a variant of V-Net). The human-aided strategy is an intuitive way to address the issue of lacking manual labels during segmentation in CT images.",

In the former category, many studies have been conducted to determine whether patients are infected with COVID-19 disease. For example, Chen et al . [2] exploits a UNet++ based segmentation model to segment COVID-19 related lesions in chest CT images of 51 COVID-19 patients and 55 patients with other diseases, and finally determine the label (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19) of each image based on the segmented lesions. Ying et al . [3] propose a CT diagnosis system, namely DeepPneumonia, which is based on the ResNet50 model to identify patients with COVID-19 from bacteria pneumonia patients and healthy people. In the second category, Tang et al . [4] proposed to first adopt VB-Net to separate the lung into anatomical sub-regions, and then use these sub-regions to compute quantitative features for training a random forest (RF) model for COVID-19 severity assessment (with labels of being non-severe or severe).",

MIL aims to learn a model that can predict the label of a bag accurately, and many recent studies have focused on implementing MIL via deep neural networks. For instance, Oquab et al . [23] train a deep model with multiple image patches of multiple scales as input, and aggregate the prediction results of multiple inputs by using a max-pooling operation. Besides, many studies [24] [25] [26] propose to formulate image classification as a MIL problem so as to address the weakly supervised problem. Moreover, MIL is particularly suitable for problems with only a limited number (e.g., tens or hundreds) of training samples in various medical image-based applications, such as computer-assisted disease diagnosis [27] [28] [29] [30] . For instance, Yan et al . [29] propose a two-stage deep MIL method to find discriminative local anatomies, where the first-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is learned in a MIL fashion to locate discriminative image patches and the second-stage CNN is boosted using those selected patches. More recently, a landmark-based deep MIL framework [30] CT image is first pre-processed, and multiple 2D image patches (with each patch from a specific slice) are then extracted to construct an instance bag for representing each input CT scan. This bag is then fed into the proposed multi-task multi-instance UNet (M 2 UNet) for joint lung lobe segmentation and severity assessment of COVID-19, consisting of a shared patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment. Here, the segmentation task can provide location and tissue guidance for the task of severity assessment that employs a hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy.",

Since our method is clinical-oriented with inconsistent imaging qualities, CT images used in this study are not as clean as those in benchmark datasets [33] . For example, the physical spacing of our data has large variation, e.g., from 0.6 mm to 10 mm between slices, because of the use of different CT scanners and scanning parameters. Using a common interpolation method (e.g., tri-linear interpolation) to resample a CT image into 1 mm, one will introduce heavy artifacts to the image. Besides, only a few infection regions in each CT image are related to severity assessment. To this end, we employ the weakly supervised multi-instance learning (MIL) strategy for handing these inconsistent CT images. Specifically, for each preprocessed CT image, we randomly crop a set of 2D patches sampled from 2D slices (with each patch from a specific slice) in each image to construct an instance bag, and each bag is used to represent a specific CT image and treated as the input of the subsequent M 2 UNet. In this way, the inter-slice/patch relationships can be implicitly captured by our M 2 UNet. In addition, this MIL strategy represents each 3D image through a set of 2D image patches rather than sequential slices. This can partially alleviate the problem of data inconsistency, so our method has high practical value in real-world applications.",

Conventional MIL represents a 2D image as a bag, and each bag consists of multiple regions of the input image (i.e., instances). Their overall prediction is made at the bag-level by roughly two kinds of methods, i.e., the embedding-level methods and the instance-level methods. The former learns the relationship among instances by projecting them into a new embedding space. The latter directly generates the bag-level predictions by performing voting on the instance predictions. However, both methods are inapplicable for the classification of 3D images, as 3D images contain multiple 2D image slices, and the class labels are also related to some local regions of the slices. In this work, based on the previous study on pathological images [12] , we propose a hierarchical MIL strategy in the classification sub-network of our M 2 UNet to perform severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, as shown in Fig. 3 . As mentioned in Section III-B, we represent each input 3D volumetric image as a bag consisting of a set of 2D image patches, and these patches are regarded as the instances in the MIL problem settings. Formally, we first construct a bag with n 2D patches cropped from the regional slices to represent each input CT image. Denote the i-th and the j-th 3D CT image as X i and X j , respectively, where X i = {\u03c6 ins i1 , \u03c6 ins i2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6 ins ini } and X j = {\u03c6 ins j1 , \u03c6 ins j2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6 ins jnj }. Here, \u03c6 ins kl \u2208 R d (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n k ) indicates the l-th instance of the k-th image. Then, these 2D patches (size: height \u00d7 width) are fed into the encoding module for patch/instance-level feature extraction. These instance-level features are further fed into an embedding-level MIL module, which will be introduced later. After obtaining the instance-level features, the bag/image-level feature \u03a6 i are then generated by our proposed global contrast pooling (GCP) layer in the image-level MIL module.",

Theoretically, the concept is a normalized weight to map features in instance feature space to an ordered embedding space. Specifically, in the GCP layer, we assume the bag-level feature \u03a6 i is represented by the relationship between instance features and p concepts. Here, these concepts are learned to reveal the data structure in a global perspective. The bag-level feature is then denoted as a p dimensional feature vector, with each dimension denoting the maximum similarity between one concept and all instance features. We use the cosine function to measure such relationships. Thus, the bag feature and the similarity can be written as",

Then, the data is normalized to the value of [0, 255], as used by other deep learning methods. The dataset is highly imbalanced as the number of severe patients is much fewer than the nonsevere patient. The ratio of the severe patient is less than 20% in our dataset. Therefore, we augmented the data by directly duplicated the severe cases in the training set. This can be done because the proposed method uses a random cropping strategy to construct the inputs. This makes the duplicated cases not the same to each other for the training of the network. We also use the random cropping strategy in the testing stage, by assuming that the data distribution is already well learned in training.

Obviously, diagnosis based on these images is a very challenging task. The severity of the patient is confirmed by clinicians, following the guideline of 2019-nCoV (trail version 7) issued by the China National Health Commission. The severity of the patient is categorized into four types, i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and critical. In clinical practice, patients are often divided into two groups with different treatment regimens, i.e., severe and non-severe. The segmentation of 152 out of 666 images were delineated by an AI-based software and confirmed by experienced radiologists. In this work, we employ this partitioning strategy. That is, mild and moderate are treated as non-severe, while severe and critical are regarded as severe. Therefore, the task of severe assessment is formulated into a binary classification problem.

Then, the quantitative features of COVID-19 patients, e.g., the infection volume and the ratio of the whole lung, are calculated based on the segmentation results. The prediction is done by a random forest method. Yang et al . [36] propose to aggregate infection scores calculated on 20 lung regions for severity assessment. Besides, the ResNet50+Max method [34] is also compared for patch-wise classification. ResNet50+Max is a non-MIL method, which has a ResNet-50 network architecture and performs image-level classification through max-voting. In addition, we apply the Gated Att.

Note that the results from the competing methods are directly obtained from the respective papers. As can be seen, four deep learning-based methods usually outperform two hand-crafted feature-based methods in most cases. For some specific metrics, the method in [4] achieves the Recall of 0.933, which is significantly better than the non-MIL method ResNet50+Max. The conventional MIL-based method in [35] gets a performance improvement in terms of accuracy by 8%. Three MIL methods (i.e., [35] , Cls. Only, and M 2 UNet) yield satisfying performance, and the proposed M 2 UNet achieves the best results (e.g.., the accuracy of 98.5% and F1 Score of 99.1%). However, the proposed method with multiple instances in multi-instance learning achieves the accuracy of 98.5% and F1 Score of 99.1%. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of six competing methods are illustrated in Fig. 6 . Note that this ROC curve is plotted based on the results on one fold testing data, which is slightly different from the average performance on five-folds in Table II. Table II and Fig. 6 clearly suggest that our M 2 UNet generates the overall best performance in the task of severity assessment of COVID-19 patients based on chest CT images.",

Here, we also investigate the influence of such a multi-task learning paradigm, by comparing M 2 UNet with its two single-task variants, i.e., 'Cls. Only' for classification and 'Seg. Only' for segmentation. The performance comparison in two tasks for severity assessment and lung lobe segmentation are reported in Table V and  Table VII , respectively. Table V suggests that, compared with Cls. Only, the multi-task learning paradigm used in M 2 UNet helps to improve the classification accuracy by 1.6%, while increasing the precision score by over 5% and the F1 Score by 2.5%. Notably, the F1 and precision of the Cls. Only method are already higher than 90%, which are hard to be improved. This is more valuable in this classification scheme, as the F1 score is more representative in evaluating such an imbalanced classification task.",

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment and lung segmentation of COVID-19 in 3D chest CT images. In this framework, we first represent each input image by a bag to deal with the challenging problem that the severity is related to local infected regions in the CT image. We further develop a multitask multi-instance deep network (called M 2 UNet) to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and segment the lung lobe simultaneously, where the context information provided by segmentation can be employed to boost the performance of severity assessment. A hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy is also proposed in M 2 UNet for severity assessment. Experimental results on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset demonstrate that our method achieves promising results in severity assessment of COVID-19 patients, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

It is interesting to perform a longitudinal study to investigate the progression of the disease, which is one of our future work. Since annotations for lung lobe in 3D CT images are usually tedious and error-prone, only a small number of subjects in our dataset have groundtruth segmentation. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop automated or even semi-automated image annotation methods, which will also be studied in the future.",
