[10] In brief, bladders from Sprague Dawley rats obtained from our institution's tissue-sharing program were excised and placed in a 35-mm. Petri dish containing 50 ml. of 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) and 0.1% sodium axide. The bladders were inverted and the mucosa was scraped off with a pair of glass slides. The remaining lamina propria and detrusor muscle were treated with 50 ml. of 10 mM PBS-0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5 to 6 hours for partial cell lysis. Bladders were then washed with 40 ml. of PBS before treatment with 50 ml. of 1 M. sodium chloride containing 2000 Kunitz units DNase (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) and stirred for 6 to 8 hours. With this, cell lysis was complete and all the intracellular components were released. The samples were then treated with 50 ml. of 4% sodium desoxycholate containing 0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5 to 6 hours to solubilize the lipid bilayer cell membranes and intracellular membrane lipids. This was repeated once. The resultant BAMG was washed three times with 50 ml. PBS and stored in 10% neomycin sulfate at 4C until grafted.",

Through a midline lower abdominal incision, the bladder was exposed and partial cystectomy (>50%) was performed. The full-bladder-size BAMG (approximately 9 \u00d7 6 mm. undistended) was grafted to the remaining host bladder with a continuous polyfilament-coated 8 - 0 absorbable suture for both the anterior and posterior wall. To identify the matrix borders, 4 non-absorbable monofilament 7 - 0 button sutures were placed-one each at the anterior, posterior, left and right sides, 3 to 4 mm. apart. Suture integrity was tested by instillation of saline through a urethral tube in the female rats and by puncturing the posterior host bladder wall in the male. When satisfactory closure was obtained, the abdominal wall and the skin were closed in two layers. No drainage was used and no drugs were administered. All animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions.",

Full-thickness longitudinal bladder strips of uniform size (approximately 7 mm. long and 2 mm. wide) were obtained from both the regenerates and the host bladder wall. With the former, great care was taken to ensure that only regenerated bladder from within the area delineated by the marking sutures was used. The strips were mounted in the tissue bath to a glass tissue support hook on one side and an isometric force displacement transducer (Radnoti Glass Technology, Monrovia CA) on the other by means of two spring wire clips connected with 4 - 0 braided silk. All preparations were sufficiently durable to withstand the grip of the wire clips during repeated or continuous contractions. Peak contraction values were related to the weight of each individual muscle strip.",

Forces lower than 1 mNewton (0.1 gm.) without bubble artifacts could be measured in the working chamber. The transducer signals were fed into a thermal array recorder (Gould TA 4000, Gould Inc., Valley View OH). For tissue stimulation, vertical L-shaped, custom-made platinum iridium electrodes (15 mm. long, 0.18 mm. diameter) separated by 10 mm. were used with a Grass S44 stimulator (Grass Instrument Co., Quincy MA). The tissue was mounted parallel to the electrodes at a preload of 25 mNewton (2.5 gm.), resulting in a resting tension of about 8 mNewton (0.8 gm.) at the end of a 60-minute equilibration period. A custom-made current-distribution box supplied supramaximal current of 0.14 amperes (A) at 15 V, which was sequentially delivered to two of eight chambers.",

After dehydration in graded ethanol solutions, the specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 micro m.) and stained with trichrome for collagen and smooth muscle, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for nuclei, alpha-actin for smooth muscle, and the non-specific neuronal protein gene product (PGP 9.5) for nerves. PGP 9.5 represents a major protein component of the neural cytoplasm and therefore labels more nerve fibers than other general nerve markers. [11] Enzyme histochemistry for acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE was performed after pre-treating sections with 10 (\u22125) M tetraisoproply pyrophosphoramide (Sigma) for 30 minutes to block the non-specific cholinesterase staining. The remainder of the AChE evaluation was carried out according to the method of El-Badawi and Schenk. [12] Tissue for adrenergic staining was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after embedding in OCT. It was then cut in 10-micro m. sections, mounted on Superfrost [TM] slides and air-dried. Adrenergic staining was conducted with the modified glyoxylic acid monoamine histofluorescent technique described by de la Torre and Surgeon. [13] For NADPH-diaphorase staining, slides were incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature in a buffer containing (per milliliter) 1 mg. NADPH, 0.1 mg. nitroblue tetrazolium, and 0.2% triton X-100. The reaction was terminated by washing with buffer, and the sections were coverslipped with a 9:1 mixture of glycerol/phosphate buffer (pH 8.6). Areas staining for NADPH-diaphorase were seen as a dark blue precipitate against a pale blue, nonstained background. [14]\n",

Incubation with the beta1+2 -adrenergic blocker propranolol (3 \u00d7 10\u22126 M) for 15 minutes before isoproterenol administration did not suppress relaxation, but it persistently prevented all strips from resuming spontaneous muscle activity (Figure 1C). The finding that propranolol was not able to inhibit isoproterenol-induced relaxation might indicate that isoproterenol given at the fairly high dose of 10\u22124 M was acting by a non-specific mechanism rather than by beta-receptor stimulation. The alpha1+2 -adrenergic agonist norepinephrine (5.6 \u00d7 10 (\u22124) M) also relaxed all BAMG regenerates and host bladder strips by zeroing their resting tension. Norepinephrine is not a pure alpha agonist, but can also be a potent beta agonist in the absence of a significant density of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The fact that norepinephrine relaxed the strips indicates that it was acting as a beta agonist in these studies.",

The generally uniform urothelial lining was sometimes found to be hyperplastic in cases of extensive bladder stone formation. Differentiated muscularis mucosae and spatially oriented, well-developed detrusor smooth muscle were formed by alpha-actin-positive smooth muscle cells. In the 4-month specimen, the thickness of the muscle bundles seemed to decrease toward the center of the graft, whereas revascularization appeared to be equally pronounced at the edges and in the mid-area of the BAMG regenerates. The two 8.5-month specimens, however, seemed to be characterized by a more balanced dispersion of vessels and muscle fibers throughout the graft. The number of alpha-actin-positive cells appeared qualitatively stable and the density of blood vessels seemed to decrease in comparison with the 4-month specimen. The collagen content and density of small- and large-diameter blood vessels appeared qualitatively greater in the BAMG regenerates. The opposite seemed true for the amount of smooth muscle at 4 and 8.5 months after grafting. PGP-positive nerve fibers could be found predominantly next to muscle bundles and the luminal surface of the graft. Their size and number increased over time. These light-microscopic findings were consistent with previous studies from our lab that used digitized slides for a quantitative computer-assisted evaluation of graft differentiation over time. [9] Differential nerve staining revealed that cholinergic, adrenergic and NADPH diaphorase-positive fibers were present in the host bladder wall tissue as well as in the BAMG regenerates (Figure 4\n).",
