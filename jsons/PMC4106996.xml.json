In addition, there have been two zoonotic introductions of coronaviruses into the human population over the last decade, both associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and high case fatality rates: severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS\u2010CoV; Drosten et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS\u2010CoV; Zaki et al., 2012). SARS\u2010CoV caused the first pandemic of the 21st century, resulting in c. 8400 human cases and an 11% case fatality rate (SARS Epidemiology Working Group, 2003). In addition to the impact of SARS\u2010CoV on infected individuals and the global public health community, the economic cost of the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak event was estimated at $16 billion (Brahmbhatt & Dutta, 2008). Although only 163 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of MERS\u2010CoV are currently reported, the high case fatality rate and travel\u2010related spread across multiple countries are reminiscent of the SARS\u2010CoV pandemic.",

MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific quantitative RT\u2010PCRs (qRT\u2010PCR), targeting the region upstream of the E protein gene and the open reading frame 1b, were rapidly developed and have become standards in the laboratory testing and diagnosis of MERS\u2010CoV (Corman et al.,2012a). Additional qRT\u2010PCRs targeting the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes have been developed as confirmatory assays (Corman et al., 2012b). The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for MERS\u2010CoV focuses on patients suffering febrile acute respiratory disease who have a direct epidemiological link to another confirmed case or are residents of or travelers to MERS\u2010CoV\u2010source countries (WHO, 2013c). Confirmatory laboratory testing requires a positive qRT\u2010PCR of at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target by qRT\u2010PCR combined with sequencing of a second target (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). In instances of inadequate testing or negative tests, a patient with a direct epidemiologic link to a confirmed MERS\u2010CoV case is determined to be a probable case of MERS\u2010CoV infection if they present with acute febrile respiratory illness.",

Although most cases have been clinically severe, contact surveillance has uncovered at least 27 subclinical or mild infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). The case fatality ratio of MERS\u2010CoV (43%) is much higher than that of SARS\u2010CoV (CFR 11%) (SARS Epidemiology Working Group, 2003). The average age of MERS\u2010CoV cases is 52 years, with a male\u2010to\u2010female ratio of 1.6\u20131 (The WHO MERS\u2010CoV Research Group, 2013). Both the case fatality ratio and the male\u2010to\u2010female ratio have decreased as the incidence of MERS\u2010CoV has increased, changes that may be attributed to improved case surveillance (Penttinen et al., 2013). Interestingly, over three quarters of MERS\u2010CoV cases have occurred in patients with comorbidities (The WHO MERS\u2010CoV Research Group, 2013). The most common comorbidities for MERS\u2010CoV cases have been diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cancer, and chronic kidney, heart, and lung disease (Assiri et al., 2013a). While these comorbidities likely affect disease progression and outcome, the strong correlation of chronic disease and MERS\u2010CoV may be biased by the high rate of these risk factors in the populations of the affected countries. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for instance, the prevalence of type\u2010II diabetes across ages is 31.6%, the prevalence of obesity is 31.1% (Al\u2010Daghri et al., 2011), and one quarter of adult males smoke (WHO, 2013a). Epidemiologic and pathogenesis studies will be necessary to discern how comorbidities impact susceptibility to, and progression of, MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

Since MERS\u2010CoV's identification in 2012, closely related coronavirus sequences have been detected in bats in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Eurasia, suggesting a widespread circulation of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010related viruses in the order Chiroptera (Annan et al., 2013; Anthony et al., 2013; De Benedictis et al., 2014; Ithete et al., 2013; Lelli et al., 2013; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2013). Investigations of samples from bats roosting in the vicinity of the first MERS\u2010CoV case in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, revealed the presence of a 190\u2010nucleotide RNA fragment with 100% match to the RdRp of MERS\u2010CoV in the feces of an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforates;Memish et al., 2013c).

Anecdotal evidence of MERS\u2010CoV patient contact with farm animals has been reported in a few cases (Albarrak et al., 2012; Buchholz et al., 2013; Drosten et al., 2013; The WHO MERS\u2010CoV Research Group, 2013), and so suspicions about the potential source of MERS\u2010CoV have focused on livestock common to the Arabian Peninsula, such as goats, sheep, dromedary camels, and cows. The first evidence for the existence of an intermediate animal reservoir was the detection of MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels from Oman and the Canary Islands (Spain) (Reusken et al.,2013b). Subsequent studies have detected MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and importantly, in camel serum collected in 2003 from the United Arab Emirates (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013;Reusken et al.,2013a; Meyer et al., 2014). While MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies were not detected in any other species of livestock tested, including chickens, goats, sheep, and cattle, seropositivity among camels passed 90% in every location, even in 2003 (Hemida et al., 2013; Perera et al., 2013;Reusken et al.,2013a, b; Meyer et al., 2014). The high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies across age grades suggests pervasive and early infection of camels with MERS\u2010CoV or a MERS\u2010CoV\u2010like virus. Recently, MERS\u2010CoV virus was detected by RT\u2010PCR in nose swabs from three camels in Qatar (Haagmans et al., 2013). The camels were epidemiologically linked to two human cases of MERS\u2010CoV, and viral fragments sequenced from the camels showed high similarity to sequences from the human cases (Haagmans et al., 2013). While this datum provides more conclusive evidence that dromedary camels form part of the MERS\u2010CoV outbreak picture, the direction of transmission is still unclear (Fig. 5). Transmission could have occurred from camels to humans, humans to camels, or concurrently from a third source to both humans and camels (Haagmans et al., 2013). Furthermore, the detection of MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels in regions with no reported human cases, such as Egypt and the Canary Islands, raises questions about the extent of MERS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV\u2010like virus circulation in Africa, the Arabic peninsula, and minor Asia (Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al.,2013b). Movement of camels between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is common and could contribute to the spread of MERS\u2010CoV between regions (Mukasa\u2010Mugerwa, 1981; Perera et al., 2013).",

R\n0 is a measure of the number of secondary cases generated by one case of disease in a na\u00efve population \u2013 an R\n0 of < 1 is self\u2010limiting within a population. Using the epidemiological information from 62 probable cases of MERS\u2010CoV infection, two different transmission scenarios were used to estimate the R\n0 for MERS\u2010CoV (Breban et al., 2013). One scenario was modeled on a large number of index patients per cluster, each generating a small transmission tree, reflecting the possibility that two epidemiologically linked cases could have been exposed to the same nonhuman source of MERS\u2010CoV. This scenario yielded an R\n0 of 0.60 and a yearly MERS\u2010CoV introduction rate of 22.3 (Breban et al., 2013). The second scenario, which used a lower rate of introduction with higher human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, predicted an R\n0 of 0.67 and a yearly introduction rate of 17.1 (Breban et al., 2013). A large\u2010scale analysis of full\u2010genome sequences of MERS\u2010CoV has identified multiple zoonotic introductions of the virus and distinct genomes circulating in the same geographic spaces, providing evidence for multiple zoonotic introductions and transmission dynamics in agreement with a lower R\n0 (Cotten et al.,2013b). Furthermore, a comparison of the R\n0s predicted for MERS\u2010CoV and prepandemic SARS\u2010CoV (R\n0 of 0.8) suggests MERS\u2010CoV has low pandemic potential (Breban et al., 2013). Another transmission model of 111 MERS\u2010CoV cases predicted a similar R\n0 (0.63), but warned that in the absence of control measures, the R\n0 could range between 0.8 and 1.3 and allow for self\u2010sustaining transmission (Cauchemez et al., 2013). Based on extrapolations of the incidence of disease in travelers returning from MERS\u2010CoV\u2010source countries, it was predicted that as many as 940 symptomatic cases of MERS\u2010CoV may have occurred before August 8, 2013 (Cauchemez et al., 2013). Epidemiologic studies will be necessary to assess the prevalence and circulation of MERS\u2010CoV infection in the human population.",

            "text": "By granting binding of the virus to the host cell, cellular receptors play an important role in determining the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses (Thackray & Holmes, 2004; Masters, 2006; Tusell et al., 2007). The MERS\u2010CoV spike protein is a 1353 amino acid type\u2010I transmembrane glycoprotein presented as a trimer on the surface of the enveloped virus. After translation, the spike protein is cleaved into two domains: the S1 subunit responsible for receptor binding and the S2 unit that mediates membrane fusion (Ohnuma et al., 2013; Raj et al\n2013). The S1 spike glycoprotein binds to the surface enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26). DPP4 is a type\u2010II transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the cleavage of N\u2010terminal proline\u2010containing dipeptides and aids glucose metabolism by proteolytic inactivation of incretins (Engel et al., 2003; Hiramatsu et al., 2003; Lambeir et al., 2003). DPP4 is the third exopeptidase found to act as a receptor for coronaviruses (Raj et al., 2013). Blocking the enzymatic activity of DPP4 does not affect MERS\u2010CoV susceptibility, and so the significance of these enzymes as receptors for coronaviruses is thought to lie in their widespread expression on endothelial and epithelial tissues (Raj et al., 2013). DPP4 is relatively conserved between mammalian species, allowing MERS\u2010CoV to bind to species as diverse as bats and humans (M\u00fcller et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2013). The receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of MERS\u2010CoV, the region of the spike protein that attaches to the DPP4 receptor, has been mapped to 240 amino acid residues in the S1 region of the spike protein (Chen et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). Co\u2010crystallization of MERS\u2010CoV spike protein and DPP4 revealed an interaction between the beta\u2010propeller blades 4 and 5 of DPP4 and beta\u2010strands 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the MERS\u2010CoV RBD, also known as the receptor\u2010binding motif (RBM; Fig. 6; Lu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). The RBD of the spike protein induces neutralizing antibodies, making it an important target for the development of prophylactics and therapeutics (Agnihothram et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a,b,c; Gierer et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013).",

Yet consistent with observations of SARS\u2010CoV infection, MERS\u2010CoV infection of human respiratory cells does not lead to a pronounced type\u2010I IFN response (Kopecky\u2010Bromberg et al., 2007; Kindler et al., 2013; Zielecki et al., 2013). Type\u2010I IFNs play a key role in viral immunity, and pathogenic viruses often evade innate immunity through antagonist proteins that disrupt the IFN reaction (Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre & Biron, 2006; Randall & Goodbourn, 2008; Taylor & Mossman, 2013). In MERS\u2010CoV, inhibition of type\u2010I IFNs has been demonstrated by the structural M protein and the accessory proteins encoded by ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 (Yang et al., 2013). The most potent inhibitor, ORF 4a, has been shown to inhibit type\u2010I IFN activation by blocking the interaction between the RNA helicase sensor MDA5 and viral double\u2010stranded RNA, a mechanism distinct from that employed by SARS\u2010CoV (Kopecky\u2010Bromberg et al., 2007; Niemeyer et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013).",

The reduction in the rate of MERS\u2010CoV introductions in the human population requires a comprehensive understanding of the nonhuman source of MERS\u2010CoV and the spatial and temporal dynamics of MERS\u2010CoV circulation in this source. On the other hand, interrupting the human\u2010to\u2010human transmission cycle of MERS\u2010CoV calls for an understanding of the parameters involved in transmission, such as virus shedding, stability, and routes of transmission. Although routes of transmission for MERS\u2010CoV are not well understood, the spread of MERS\u2010CoV between people in close contact settings suggests that direct contact and fomite transmission routes are likely to be involved. As stated above, the localization of MERS\u2010CoV infection in the lower respiratory tract implicates coughing and other exudates as important sources of virus shedding. In addition, the environmental stability of MERS\u2010CoV provides some information on the potential for fomite transmission. At low temperatures and humidity, both MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV virions retain viability on smooth surfaces much longer than many other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus H1N1, HCoV\u2010229E, and HCoV\u2010OC43 (Sizun et al., 2000; Chan et al., 2011; van Doremalen et al., 2013). Thus, temperature\u2010controlled settings such as hospitals may be of particular risk for fomite transmission of MERS\u2010CoV. Performing high\u2010risk patient care procedures such as intubation and manual ventilation, along with inconsistent use of surgical masks, was associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS\u2010CoV to healthcare workers (Ofner\u2010Agostini et al., 2006; Nishiyama et al., 2008). Healthcare workers are a growing cohort of MERS\u2010CoV cases, but while routes of exposure may be similar for both viruses, the MERS\u2010CoV outbreak has not been characterized by the hospital\u2010based super\u2010spreader events which defined the epidemiology of SARS\u2010CoV (Lipsitch et al., 2003).",

Thus, SARS\u2010CoV transmission could be prevented in the general population by basic public health and infection control measures, such as the isolation of patients in negative\u2010pressure rooms, active surveillance and quarantine of contacts, and the provision of education and protective equipment for healthcare workers (Twu et al., 2003; Svoboda et al., 2004).

Commercially available drugs, such as type\u2010I IFNs, lopinavir, and, at very high concentrations, ribavirin, were shown to inhibit cytopathic effect of SARS\u2010CoV in in vitro studies, with a synergistic antiviral effect described for type\u2010I IFNs and ribavirin (Chen et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004; Birgit et al., 2005). These drugs were used to varying extents on SARS\u2010CoV patients, often in combination with corticosteroids (Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013). Ribavirin is a structural analog of guanosine with broad\u2010spectrum mutagenic effects on viruses. Despite its frequent use on SARS\u2010CoV patients, ribavirin was not shown to be effective for patients, and adverse effects such as hemolytic anemia were common (Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013). Type\u2010I IFN regimens for SARS\u2010CoV patients were sometimes used as part of a multi\u2010drug regimen, and one study of 22 SARS\u2010CoV patients reported more rapid improvement of radiographic lung pathologies and better oxygenation in patients treated with IFN\u2010\u03b11 (Loutfy et al., 2003; Stockman et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2013). Speculations that immunopathology rather than uncontrolled viral replication contributed to lung deterioration during advanced SARS\u2010CoV infection favored the widespread use of corticosteroids in its treatment (Nicholls et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Hui & Sung, 2004; Cheng et al., 2013). Retrospective analysis of SARS\u2010CoV patients showed no benefit of corticosteroid administration except when critical cases were analyzed alone and death\u2010related variables were adjusted. Among these critical patients, corticosteroid therapy did significantly reduce case fatality (Chen, 2006). Similarly, corticosteroids have been used in some MERS\u2010CoV patients with severe disease (Assiri et al.,2013a; Guberina et al., 2013; Memish et al.,2013b; Omrani et al., 2013). One previously healthy MERS\u2010CoV patient who suffered ARDS, multidrug\u2010resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and suspected concomitant allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis improved rapidly when treated with the corticosteroid prednisolone (Guberina et al., 2013). The efficacy of corticosteroid treatment for other MERS\u2010CoV patients with ARDS has not been reported.",

            "text": "Therapies used during the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak have shaped investigations of treatment regimens for MERS\u2010CoV. MERS\u2010CoV shows greater sensitivity than SARS\u2010CoV to the antiviral effects of type\u2010I and type\u2010III IFNs in vitro and ex vivo (Kindler et al., 2013; Wilde et al., 2013; Zielecki et al., 2013). This greater sensitivity could be explained by mechanistic differences of IFN antagonist accessory proteins between the viruses. For instance, MERS\u2010CoV lacks a homologue of the SARS\u2010CoV ORF6 protein, which blocks the STAT1\u2010activating effects of IFNs and ultimately the transcriptional activation of downstream antiviral genes (Wilde et al., 2013). A comparison of five different IFNs has shown IFN\u2010\u03b2 to be the most potent inhibitor of MERS\u2010CoV (Hart et al., 2013). Although high concentrations of ribavirin were effective in vitro in one study (Falzarano et al.,2013a), another study found no inhibitory effects of ribavirin at a dose translatable to current drug regiments in humans (Hart et al., 2013). When IFN\u2010\u03b12b and ribavirin were used in combination against MERS\u2010CoV, however, the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of the drugs in combination were much lower than for the individual drugs. This additive effect decreased the drug requirements to concentrations potentially achievable in humans (Falzarano et al.,2013a). Interestingly, ribavirin is significantly more effective when the ExoN activity of coronaviruses is knocked out (Smith et al., 2013). Data indicate that in these knockout viruses, ribavirin has a greater ability to inhibit viral RNA synthesis and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and enzyme necessary for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which would explain the relatively high ribavirin dose needed to achieve inhibition of viral replication with MERS\u2010CoV (Smith et al., 2013).",

However, experimental infection studies in rhesus macaques showed that this animal species was susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV (Munster et al., 2013). In rhesus macaques, MERS\u2010CoV causes a lower respiratory tract infection reminiscent of mild to moderate human cases (de Wit et al.,2013b). Clinical signs of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected macaques included cough and increased respiration rate, and lung samples showed lesions characteristic of mild to marked pneumonia (Munster et al., 2013; de Wit et al.,2013b). Virus was detected throughout the respiratory tract and mediastinal lymph nodes, with viral loads higher earlier during infection. The primary sites of virus replication were type\u2010I and type\u2010II pneumocytes, main components of the alveolar architecture. Replication of MERS\u2010CoV deep in the macaque lower respiratory tract may explain the low potential for transmission of MERS\u2010CoV. Despite renal failure in some human patients, virus was absent from the kidney tissue of all macaques (de Wit et al.,2013b). A more recent characterization of MERS\u2010CoV in rhesus macaques reported transient fever in infected monkeys and demonstrated a MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibody response in the macaques starting at 7 days postinfection (Yao et al., 2013).

Doses were designed to achieve serum concentrations at or above the EC50 values determined in vitro. Treated animals did not show the clinical signs or hematological changes that developed in the untreated animals, such as breathing difficulties, decreased oxygen saturation levels, and increased neutrophil counts (Falzarano et al., 2013b). Gross pathology of lungs from treated animals was normal, while untreated animals displayed visible lesions. Histopathology revealed mild signs of bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the treated animals, with more abundant alveolar edema and severe lesions seen in the untreated animals. The MERS\u2010CoV viral load in lung samples was 0.81 log lower for treated animals compared to untreated animals. Furthermore, a lung\u2010specific host response occurred in untreated macaques but not in treated animals, with increased levels of the cytokines and chemokines IL\u20106, IFN\u2010y, and MCP\u20101. Reduced expression of inflammatory genes was observed in the lungs of treated animals (Falzarano et al., 2013b). The significant improvement in clinical score for treated animals despite relatively similar viral loads between the groups suggests that immunopathology may be a factor in the severity of MERS\u2010CoV infection. However, because the rhesus macaque model only recapitulates mild to moderate disease in humans, the effectiveness of these drugs against MERS\u2010CoV\u2010induced ARDS is unclear. Timing is also critical to the efficacy of treatment; most patients do not begin treatment until they are quite ill, whereas drug regimens in the macaques began only 8 h postinoculation. The translation of drug regimens from the laboratory to the clinic must address such discrepancies.",

The spike protein, and especially its RBD, is considered a key component in coronavirus vaccine design (Du et al., 2009, 2013b,c). A replication\u2010defective vaccinia virus\u2010based vaccine expressing the full\u2010length spike protein of MERS\u2010CoV has been shown to produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice, but virus challenge cannot be applied to the mouse model (Song et al., 2013).Vaccination with recombinant protein containing a truncated RBD of the spike protein (amino acids 377\u2013588) and the Fc of human IgG also induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies. The truncated RBD elicited higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than vaccination with a recombinant protein containing a larger fragment of the spike protein (amino acids 377\u2013662). The authors suggest that non\u2010neutralizing epitopes within the 588\u2013662 region of the polypeptide may compete with neutralizing epitopes or destabilize the formation of the RBD (Du et al., 2013b). To maximize the protectiveness of neutralizing antibodies across MERS\u2010CoV strains, the natural variation of MERS\u2010CoV spike proteins needs to be characterized and considered in the design of vaccines (Graham et al., 2013). Live\u2010attenuated viruses are another approach to MERS\u2010CoV vaccine development. A MERS\u2010CoV mutant lacking the structural E protein has been shown to be replication\u2010competent but propagation\u2010defective (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013). Development of safe and effective MERS\u2010CoV vaccines must potentially overcome the challenges that arose for SARS\u2010CoV. No in vivo testing of vaccines has been performed to date; it remains therefore unclear whether challenge with MERS\u2010CoV would illicit pulmonary immunopathology upon challenge. Creative approaches, such as the use of adjuvants that promote TH1 cell responses, need to be pursued, and potential vaccines must be rigorously evaluated in animal models (Graham et al., 2013).",

Preliminary evidence shows a direct relation between underlying comorbidities and disease severity (Assiri et al.,2013a). The observation that primary cases have been more severe than secondary cases, even when controlling for underlying conditions, might suggest that these primary cases were exposed to higher virus doses than secondary cases (The WHO MERS\u2010CoV Research Group, 2013). This could also indicate that MERS\u2010CoV is more readily transmissible from the intermediate reservoir to humans than from human\u2010to\u2010human and that milder MERS\u2010CoV cases would be less likely to efficiently transmit MERS\u2010CoV. Human\u2010to\u2010human transmission could increase if MERS\u2010CoV becomes better adapted to humans. Prolonged MERS\u2010CoV replication in immune\u2010compromised patients could increase opportunity for the virus to acquire mutations enabling efficient transmission.

MERS\u2010CoV likely originated from bats, acting as the natural reservoir. From the natural reservoir, MERS\u2010CoV spilled either directly over to humans (green arrow) or via an intermediate host (dromedary camels, purple arrow). Currently, the exact route of zoonotic transmission of MERS\u2010CoV into the human population remains unknown although the presence of MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies and the detection of MERS\u2010CoV in dromedary camels suggest that this species is likely to play a major role in the emergence of MERS\u2010CoV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that multiple introductions of MERS\u2010CoV into the human population have occurred and both zoonotic transmission events and human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (blue arrows) drive the current MERS\u2010CoV outbreak.",
