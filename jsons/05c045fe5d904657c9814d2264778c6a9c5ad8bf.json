Methods We describe our synergic experience between ENT and ICU Departments at University Hospital of Modena underlining some controversial aspects that would be worth discussing tracheostomies in these patients. During the last 2 weeks, we performed 28 tracheostomies on patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection who were treated with IMV. Results No differences between percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy in terms of timing and no case of team virus infection. Conclusion In our experience, tracheostomy should be performed only in selected patients within 7-and 14-day orotracheal intubation.",

Both percutaneous and surgical tracheostomies can be performed. Surgical tracheostomy should be indicated for BMI > 30 patients with short neck and documented thyroid gland hypertrophy. We have been always performing trans-isthmus tracheostomy with tracheal-toskin stitches on inferior margin without ETT removal to avoid accidental displacement of tracheal cannula. Cuffed non-fenestrated cannula should be used to limit diffusion of the virus. Every effort should be made not to pierce the cuff of the ETT when performing tracheostomy. Initial advancement of the ETT should be performed prior to tracheostomy window being made. Ventilation has to cease prior to tracheostomy tube insertion, which has to be swift and accurate with prompt inflation of the cuff. Most skilled ENT surgeon should perform the procedure due to the uncomfortable setting of the ICU COVID-19 room and personal protective equipment.",

There is no evidence that tracheostomy improves patient's clinical course. It is established that tracheostomy reduces the ICU stay. In the context of prolonged IMV required in COVID-19 experience, tracheostomy should be suggested to avoid potential tracheal damages within 7 and 14 days. Surgical tracheostomy should be proposed only in selected patients.",
