            "text": "years old Chinese male patient, diagnosed as advanced lung adenocarcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 19-Del mutation, after gefitinib and subsequent osimertinib treatments, was receiving a third-line maintenance chemotherapy of Pemetrexed coupled with Bevacizumab before the outbreak in Wuhan. Within epidemic epicenter, due to the overload of infected patients, most of hospitals suspended their regular healthcare services. As a result, almost all cancer patients had to be isolated at home. After three weeks delay of chemotherapy, the patient reported pain in the lumbar spine on February 9, 2020, followed by slightly dry cough 3 days after. The patient denied fever, myalgia, diarrhea, etc. Through the online consultation of an oncologist, the patient reported the current symptoms were quite similar to those seen in his past disease progression of lung cancer. On February 14, the patient chose to re-challenge osimertinib as an alternative treatment. After one day of re-challenge, those symptoms were greatly relieved. Until February 25, the patient complained of new bone pains at inconsistent sites. As the outbreak passing, medical institutions in Wuhan gradually recovered. This patient returned to our hospital on March 30, 2020. The screening of COVID-19 showed that his chest computed tomography (CT) and throat swab reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 were negative, while his serological IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were both positive, whereby the patient used to be an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier. Considering positive IgM antibody might represent the potential infectivity, the patient was placed in an isolation ward to prevent possible in-hospital transmissions. The subsequent throat swabs tests on days of March 31, April 2, and April 3 were all negative. The serological IgM antibody turned to negative on April 3, confirming the patient was recovering from COVID-19. Meanwhile, as a close contact, his wife was required to receive screening, and she tested positive alone for serological IgG antibody but negative in throat swab assay and chest CT. His wife denied any clinical symptoms and contact histories. This truth of familial transmission highlights asymptomatic carriers are indeed contagious.",
