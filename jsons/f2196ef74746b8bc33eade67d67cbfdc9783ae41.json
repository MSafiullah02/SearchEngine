A much broader approach to the movement of virulence genes is needed to recognize critical molecular level exchanges that drive the emergence of new animal and human infectious agents. We to extend our research on emerging infectious diseases to the molecular level to understand the evolution of pathogens, environmental survival, the exchange of virulence factors, and changes in host ranges. We also need for a new paradigm to broaden the meaning of the term zoonoses so as to recognize that the flow of microbes and their genes is multidirectional and includes environmental reservoirs. Modern molecular methods, especially metagenomics, are providing insights into the relationships between microorganisms and virulence genes in animal populations (both domestic and wildlife), humans, and diverse environments. Ideally a One Health approach to management of zoonotic diseases can prevent human outbreaks and minimize animal culling.",

Hospital-based surveillance for human rabies in Togo has reported 159 cases in the 10-year period from 2001 to 2010. All of the cases were diagnosed clinically, without laboratory confirmation. All patients died in hospital or were lost to follow-up after being removed from hospital by family. In May 2010, an evaluation of the national capacity for rabies surveillance in human and animal populations was done, which suggested that there is underreporting of rabies in all species. In August 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) began work with the Togo ministries of Health and Agriculture, and local human and animal health practitioners to improve rabies surveillance and prevention activities in the country. The launch of a national effort to apply a One Health approach to rabies control in Togo took place in conjunction with World Rabies Day 2010. Improving animal and human rabies surveillance will be based upon strengthening case definitions, standardizing clinical reporting and instituting laboratory confirmation. Epidemiological and sociological surveys will be done in collaboration with the FAO, to collect data on risk factors for rabies exposure and high risk behaviour post exposure to aide in strengthening rabies prevention and control. Lessons learned in creating a One Health strategy for rabies control in Togo may be useful throughout West Africa.",

National-surveillance serotyping data from 1998 to 2007 were applied to the model. Results suggested that the relative contribution of the sources to salmonellosis varied during the 10 year period, and that eggs are the most important source of disease, being responsible for over 50 % of the cases in most years. Broilers followed in importance in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2005 , while swine was the second most important source in 2000, 2004 and 2007 . Salmonella was seldom isolated from cattle and few cases were attributed to this source. The proportion of cases attributed to an unknown source varied substantially between years. We conclude that this is valid approach to attribute salmonellosis in Japan, and that and improved dataset would substantially improve results.

Reproductive diseases which cause abortion, early embryonic death, failure to conceive, and high neonatal mortality, will be chief among these. Ghana, a west-African nation with a growing economy, stable government, and active agriculture sector, is a prime example of a nation which has entered this next phase of disease control. Having recently eradicated rinderpest, this nation's cattle industry is poised to grow to meet its substantial in-country and export needs. In addition, increased efficiency of production can reduce the environmental impact of cattle production. However, in many herds, fecundity is not increasing. When we evaluated a herd in the coastal region near the capital, Accra, serology indicated that infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and trichomoniasis were prevalent at rates of approximately 38% and 45% respectively, with lower rates of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (2%), Bovine Herpesvirus-4 (8%), coxiellosis (18%), and neosporosis (6%). Ghana has been aggressively controlling brucellosis nationwide, and in the herd examined here, there was no serologic evidence of Brucella abortus. This herd had an inter-calf ratio of 2.5 years, much longer than that of developed nations. This study demonstrates that while great strides have been made in controlling major livestock diseases, more insidious reproductive diseases still may provide a barrier to obtaining national selfsufficiency and food security in the cattle industry.",

The recent highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) H5N1 is a virulent virus with the potential to cause deaths in wild and domestic birds, humans and some other species. Migration of water birds represents the main risk of carrying AI viruses over long distances and provides a complex network because different bird flyways overlap geographically. Australia is located at the East Asian -Australasian Flyway and many migratory birds come from areas in which HPAI cases have been confirmed in the recent past. Further, their migration routes bring them down the heavily populated east coast of Australia in which there are large flocks of commercial poultry.

Emerging viral diseases among marine mammals have spread at rates many times greater than the highest epidemic spread rates in the terrestrial environments, demonstrating that the marine environment is particularly efficient at rapidly spreading novel pathogens. The marine environment, however, is often overlooked as a source of emerging zoonotic diseases. To better characterize marine mammal diseases and their associations with human health, pathogens for small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises), otariids (sea lions), and phocids (seals) were prioritized among 72 microbes based upon their likelihood of marine mammal exposures, illnesses, deaths, and epizootics. High priority pathogens were then assessed for their relevance to public health. The top ten marine mammal pathogens of interest were Leptospira interrogans, morbillivirus, parapoxvirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, Pseudomonas species, West Nile virus, Uncinaria, Toxoplasma gondii, and Pasteurella species. At least 49% of all 72 pathogens were zoonotic, 17% were reportable human diseases in the U.S., and 28% were emerging human diseases. This is the first formal prioritization of pathogens among many marine mammal populations in relation to epizootic potential and human health. In conclusion, active surveillance of infectious diseases among marine mammals may not only facilitate animal conservation efforts, but may help document movement of pathogens between terrestrial and marine environments and enable prediction of ocean-based emerging diseases among humans.",

The line follows the major poultry trading route in Bangladesh. Moreover, several migratory bird stopovers were identified along the line. Directional statistics revealed that the outbreaks were introduced in the south-eastern part of the country and followed a significant south-east to north-west direction of the epidemic progression. Survival analysis of time to the first outbreak describes the temporal evolution of the epidemic. We estimated that the highest number of the subdistricts to be infected at a given week was 15. This information is of practical value and could be useful to assess possible infectiousness at spatial scale and to estimate the resources required to address an outbreak with certain magnitude at a given point in time. In conclusion, the persistence of the line of magnitude and direction over the past 3 years indicates the necessity of mobilizing maximum resources not at random, but on this line to strengthen the existing surveillance particularly prior to and in the winter months.",

Specific antigenetic data derived from ongoing swine surveillance programmes was utilised to gain insights into the origin of pH1N1 and define their relatedness to endemic strains of H1 influenza viruses in pigs. This data was utilised to guide development of assays for application to the veterinary sector for the detection of pH1N1 by the OFFLU community. A testing algorithm suitable for application to pH1N1 surveillance in animal populations was developed. The design of surveillance programmes took into account complicating factors such as potential absence of clinical signs, extended virus shedding in infected pigs and impact of prior influenza immunity. This information was important for the identification of appropriate and proportionate control measures that could mitigate against the spread of the virus both within the veterinary sector and through zoonotic infection. The widespread occurrence of influenza in pig populations since June 2009 was due to primary infection via contact with infected humans and secondary spread within pigs. Movement of virus in the interface between animals and humans in particular those occupationally exposed revealed transmission but the virus has not yet had sufficient time to genetically evolve independently from contemporary human strains, although further genetic diversity through reassortment has been detected.

Outbreaks of A(H1N1) 2009 influenza in farmed swine continue to be reported to the OIE by numerous countries around the world. In July 2009 Australia was the third such country to report A(H1N1) 2009 influenza in farmed pigs. It was also the first report of swine influenza A virus in this country. Following the first outbreak, in NSW, two further outbreaks affecting pigs were reported in Victoria and Queensland respectively. Nasal swabs and other samples collected from infected pigs in these outbreaks were subjected to virus isolation and nucleic acid purification. Sequences of all eight genes of virus isolated from pigs confirmed high homologies to A(H1N1) 2009 viruses circulating in Australia. During the Queensland piggery outbreak, diagnostic specimens were also obtained from two farm in-contact persons who developed influenza like illness following onset of illness in pigs. Haemagglutinin gene sequences showed that viruses from each person were identical to viruses from different pigs, indicating that each person could have been infected by different pigs with distinct strains of A(H1N1) 2009 virus. Gene phylogenies could also distinguish viruses from the different Australian piggery outbreaks. Pyrosequencing of discriminatory regions of all eight genome segments also showed that reassortment had not occurred in viruses from these Australian cases. This study provided opportunity to examine A(H1N1) 2009 viruses involved in probable inter-species transmission between pigs and humans. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus of the family Bunyaviridae. Transmission of RVF to humans occurs through direct contact with the blood and tissues of infected animals, and less commonly through mosquito bites and unpasteurized milk. Most infections in humans are asymptomatic or present as a self-limiting influenzalike illness. Severe disease occurs in less than 1% of infected persons. Focal outbreaks of RVF in animals occurred in South Africa in 2008 and 2009 with an epizootic in 2010. The likely mode of transmission and clinical presentation and complications in affected humans are described.",

Mostly all low-income countries are affected by at least five neglected tropical diseases simultaneously. Amongst the noticeable risk factors worthy of mention involves a high level of interaction between humans and their livestock, and possibly wildlife as seen in poor economies in developing countries. Of all human pathogens, 60% are zoonotic and attributed to animals and unlike newly emerging zoonoses that attract the attention of the developed world, these zoonotic diseases which are often endemic are by comparison neglected. This is presumably a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in underestimation of their global burden. Their attenuated importance in the eyes of administrators and funding agencies has led to a reduced output in terms of research, diagnosis and reporting of these diseases. This paper attempts to evaluate the disease burden in humans and animals of two bacterial diseases-tuberculosis and brucellosis in Sub-saharan Africa as well as highlighting their health impact in humans. The effect of the diagnostic tools used as routine tools in the health sector Sub-sharan Africa will also be assessed versus the efficacy of these diagnostic tools. Factors which are indicative of these diseases as being underreported will also be highlighted and suggestions as well as recommendation will be proffered in the light of these two bacterial diseases. This review will highlight what has been published and is currently ongoing regarding NZD. Zoonotic diseases are complex with the involvement of both animals and humans in disease transmission. Knowledge of disease transmission in animals is essential for an understanding of transmission in humans, and ultimately, for the control and prevention of human disease. However, significant research gaps exist within the current state of knowledge of zoonoses. This has considerable impact on research outcomes, particularly in disease prioritization. In order to prioritize diseases, it is necessary to make decisions based on scientifically valid information; yet disease prioritization to date has relied on the best available information that often lacks scientific evidence. Identifying these gaps would lead to an improvement in research outcomes.",

Staging at stopover sites during migration is longer than the period of infection and viral shedding, preventing bird from dispersing a virus over several consecutive but interrupted long-distance movements.

This has been facilitated by adaptation of the virus to new midge vectors that can survive the Northern winter and a link to global warming has been proposed. Despite the importance of insects in the epidemiology of the disease, many aspects of BTV replication and vector competence remain unresolved. We have used confocal and electron microscopy to investigate the relationship of the virus with mammalian and insect host cells. We have followed the infection process of BTV in sheep and correlated pathology findings with confocal imaging and shown that small capillaries in a number of organs including the skin (not previously reported as a site of viral replication) are an early site of replication of BTV. The role of the 4 non-structural proteins (NS1,2,3,3A) in mammalian and particularly insect cells is not clear. Our in vitro studies have shown novel interactions of NS2 with the cytoskeleton resulting in aberrant cell division. Future studies will focus on the insect vector using advanced imaging techniques and reverse genetics to generate novel probes (eg GFP-labelled viral proteins) to elucidate the replication process of BTV and the factors underlying vector competence. Results from these studies may be applicable to other virus/host systems.",

With the aim of constructing hypotheses that can be tested in the field, we developed a spatially structured SEIR model of HeV in wild flying fox populations, and parameterized the model with field and laboratory data. Using our model we explored three hypotheses that could explain viral persistence in flying fox populations-metapopulation dynamics, long infectious periods and waning immunity-and compared model output to patterns observed in field data. To investigate potential drivers of HeV emergence, we examined the impact of recent changes to flying fox ecology, including urban habituation, declining migratory behaviour and the physiological impacts of pregnancy and nutritional stress. Urban habituation increased the number of flying foxes in contact with humans and horses while declining migratory behaviour decreased herd immunity, allowing more intense outbreaks to occur after viral reintroduction, an effect that was more pronounced using the metapopulation model of virus persistence. Nutritional stress and pregnancy have the potential to create ''stress synchrony'' which could lead to an increased risk of viral spillover. Finally we discuss the sampling protocols that will help us develop a mechanistic explanation for the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence.",

It also highlights the need for further work to determine the distribution and diversity of viruses in the Genus Henipavirus and their epidemiology in reservoir hosts. Nipah virus (NiV) emerged in Malaysia in 1998 as a respiratory and neurologic disease in pigs and caused a severe febrile encephalitis in humans associated with a 40% mortality rate (n = 265). Ten Nipah virus outbreaks and several sporadic cases in Bangladesh (case fatality rate&71%; n = 122) and two outbreaks in West Bengal, India associated with Nipah virus (case fatality rate&55%; n = 96) have been reported since 2001. Serological evidence and viral isolates suggest that several genera of bats may become infected with henipaviruses. Bats of the genus Pteropus are considered a primary natural reservoir for Nipah virus and other related henipaviruses throughout a large part of their range, including regions where human infections have occurred. In Bangladesh, Nipah virus outbreaks in humans show a strong seasonal and spatial pattern. While domestic animal amplifying hosts may also play a role in human infection, several outbreaks appear to involve direct bat-to-human transmission, in some cases via a food-borne route. To characterize the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of Nipah virus in Pteropus giganteus and the ecology of P. giganteus in Bangladesh in order to assess the risk of Nipah virus spillover to humans and livestock. Coordinated investigation of zoonotic agents in human, livestock and wildlife populations is important for assessing the risk of spillover from wildlife to human or livestock hosts. Preliminary data on Nipah virus in bats offers insight into risk management for spillover.",

Coronaviruses have been identified in 36 of these species and anti-coronavirus antibodies have been detected in an additional seven. It is suspected that a previously unrecognized large diversity of coronaviruses is present in bats. The identification and characterisation of coronaviruses found in Australasian bats is essential to advance our understanding of this diversity and elaborate on the ecology and evolution of bat coronaviruses, and to inform global biosecurity preparedness. We tested 2,195 Australasian bats, sampled between 1997 and 2009 for evidence of coronavirus infection. We have identified four coronaviruses in seven species of Australian bats and detected anti-coronavirus antibodies in an additional 18 species from Australia, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. This evidence of coronavirus infection increases the known global distribution of bat coronaviruses into Australasia. We also identified the inter-species transmission of a Group 1 Australian bat coronavirus from bats of the genus Miniopterus to Rhinolophus, which supports the hypothesis that Rhinolophus spp. may be more likely to foster host shifts than other species of bats and may pose a risk for the emergence of SARS-like and other bat coronaviruses. This inter-species transmission also indicates that we have detected the precursors required for the emergence of an Australian bat coronavirus; however, given the lack of evidence for the establishment of coronaviruses in Australian Rhinolophus spp., this appears unlikely.",

In Hong Kong, astroviruses were detected from 36% to 100% of Miniopterus bats in a single habitat during different seasons in a year. The genetic diversity of astroviruses in bats in this single habitat was remarkably high. The mean value of RNA polymerase gene nucleotide sequence differences of astroviruses in M. magnater and in M. pusillus was 26.4% and 25.1% respectively. For comparison, a similar analysis for different serotypes of typical human astroviruses worldwide shows about 10-15% nucleotide difference. Taken together, these observations suggest virus persistence in the bat population, rather than repeated epidemic sweeps caused by successive novel astroviruses.",

Available sequencing data indicate that during the 2010 outbreak of RVF in South Africa, most cases resulted from infection with very closely related virus strains, however, compared to previous large outbreaks of the disease in the country, incidence and fatality rates in humans appear to be unusually high. Diagnosis of brucellosis in endemic country like India is routinely carried out by ELISA in cattle; RBPT and STAT in sheep and goats, pigs and human; and isolation and PCR in limited studies. In this study, separate indirect ELISA protocols have been standardized for sheep and goats, pigs and human, using smooth LPS antigen from B. abortus S 99 . Random serum samples {sheep (n = 1702); goats (n = 2362); pigs (n = 1734) and human [n = 499 -comprising of 123 blood donors; 179 veterinarians and 197 having pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)]} from different states of the country were screened using the standardized indirect ELISAs. Prevalence percentage of anti-Brucella antibodies in pigs (22.43%), goats (5.14%), sheep (6.22%), and veterinary professionals (40.79%), patients having PUO (11.67%) and blood donors (4.87%) were recorded. To overcome the problem of using separate iELISA for diagnosis of brucellosis in each species, a common iELISA for both livestock and human using recombinant protein-G has been standardized. On comparative evaluation of 400 sera samples (50 each RBPT positive and 50 negatives from cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and human), the relative diagnostic sensitivity of the assay varied from 100% in pigs followed by 92% in both human and sheep and goats, and 88% in cattle. The relative diagnostic specificity ranged from 100% in human and cattle to 96% in pigs and sheep and goats. The study revealed prevalence of brucellosis in livestock, its transmission to humans in endemic regions is obvious and its implications are enormous. A common ELISA reported useful for screening both human and animals and aid the present diagnostic procedures in both veterinary and medical professionals and public health. Some Mycoplasma species are considered pathogens in human and animal medicine, while others are considered opportunistic pathogens.

In spite of the early success of etiological studies and molecular characterization of this new virus, efforts to identify the exact animal origin of SARS-CoV have been less successful. Although there was strong evidence suggesting infected masked palm civets as the source of human infections that precipitated the SARS outbreaks, infection in this and other mammalian species in animal markets was more likely a reflection of an 'artificial' market cycle in na\u00efve species. The discovery of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) in Chinese horseshoe bats in China has focused global attention on bats as the most likely natural host of the SARS-CoV responsible for the human outbreaks. In vitro studies on ACE2 molecules, a known functional cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, indicated that bats other than those in the genus Rhinolophus may also be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and hence could potentially act as the natural reservoir host. Based on these and serological studies of different bat species, infection experiments were conducted in the BSL4 animal facility at AAHL using two Australian species, Rhinolophus megaphyllus and Pteropus alecto. As predicted from the receptor studies, successful infection was established in Pteropus alecto in the absence of clinical signs. Further laboratory studies, in conjunction with more extensive field investigation, are required to provide insight into the elusive key first step of SARS emergence, the jump of SARS-CoV from reservoir species to an intermediate host.",

The primary focus of our research group has been on investigating the relationship between the highly pathogenic henipaviruses and pteropid bats since the discovery of flying foxes as the natural host of HeV in Australia. Recently, primary cell lines from four different species of bats (one pteropid and three micro bats) were established. These cell lines will be essential tools for our study of bat immunology and host-virus interactions. Here, we will present data to demonstrate that these cell lines are also very useful for isolation of both known and unknown bat viruses. These cell lines, in conjunction with improved sampling strategies in the field, has lead to multiple isolation of HeV from bat urine samples collected in several locations across Queensland, including those associated with human and horse spillover events. This is a significant outcome since, despite an intensive search over many years, there had only been one isolation of HeV from bat samples previously. This HeV-targeted surveillance program has also led to discovery of a number of novel viruses including paramyxovirus, herpesvirus and adenovirus. Our continuing investigation of virus infection dynamics in bats will improve the understanding of bat-virus interaction and, hopefully provide insight into the key factors which trigger spill-over events of bat-borne zoonotic viruses.",

Pathogen flow into wildlife was often traced to these seasonal activities and provided a window on the infection in livestock, and contributed to spread but not overall persistence. The reason being that landscape change has significant impacts on demographics of wild species, their behaviour and host potential. This was fortunate, in the case of rinderpest but this may not be so for an increasing number of infections with multiple hosts.

A study was undertaken to assess infectious disease surveillance and preparedness analysis across the public and animal health sectors in Tanzania, focusing on two districts. This was undertaken by rapid situation analysis, field surveys and the identification of the location of surveillance points by GPS and the next-generation Android driven mobile telephones. Analytical mapping was undertaken using EpiCollect, Google-earth and ArcView. Although there were unique sector specific issues, the surveillance and reporting hierarchy was similar for the two sectors with the district being the hub. Both sectors had vertical programmes surveillance systems which were centrally coordinated from Ministry Headquarters. In the public health sector, the focal point for disease surveillance was a health-facility and the surveillance system was based on the IDSR model, by which the 13 priority diseases were categorised into 3 groups. The frequency of disease reporting depended on the category of the disease. For the animal health sector surveillance was community based and priority diseases were categorised into 4 groups. The response in the public health sector was a function of the district medical office whereas for the animal health sector it was vested with the zonally-located veterinary investigation centres, which on average cover some 20 districts. There was no formal, routine collaboration between the two sectors although in the case of disease emergencies such cross-sector collaboration was readily triggered. A new protocol is being developed with the collaboration of the two sector Ministries for One Health surveillance. Mobile technologies are being employed as the technology enablers.",

Surveillance and control of transboundary animal diseases remains a major challenge for animal production in developing countries. This has become a major public health issue for the developed world with the SARS episode in 2003 and again recently with the threat of pandemic influenzas. Innovative methodologies are greatly needed to evaluate the socioeconomical added value of animal disease surveillance adapted to the specific socio-economic contexts of the developing countries. This should come with the integration of modeling (risk-based surveillance; spatio-temporal immunity levels), socio-economy and epidemiology. Since the emerging and endemism of avian influenza H5N1 subtype in several countries in South East Asia, surveillance networks have been setup and are running but the outcomes of such investments (financial and human resources) have not been carefully evaluated. The objective of our research programme is to develop a novel methodology to evaluate the socio-economical added value of animal disease surveillance and more especially H5N1 surveillance network in South East Asia. In order to do so we apply and integrate different methodology based on social sciences (Social Network Analysis (SNA); participatory approaches), public and animal health economies (DALYS, QUALYS, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit methods) and epidemiology (risk analysis, spatial modeling). Results such as the use of SNA to evaluate the role and positioning of the different actors of the surveillance network will be presented and discussed during the conference. Such study allows the understanding of interaction between actors and the benefit they get with the outcomes of the surveillance network. The aim of this work is to provide valuable tools to decision makers to help them evaluate the best surveillance program to implement within their animal disease risk management policy. Extension off this work to evaluate the socio-economical added value of intervention programs (e.g. vaccination) is ongoing.",

Disease control measures including livestock and poultry quarantines and commodity movement restrictions may disrupt market continuity and food security. In the case of egg production, facilities often do not have sufficient capacity to store eggs or egg products for prolonged periods. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working proactively to ensure products and animals move securely and safely during animal disease outbreaks. The U.S. Secure Egg Supply (SES) plan is one such initiative to ensure food availability, food security and animal health protections through continuity of business planning. The SES plan includes proactive risk assessments performed prior to any HPAI outbreak to facilitate timely permitting decisions for egg or egg product movements during an outbreak. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of the One Health approach to HPAI emergency response planning based on the SES plan and the proactive risk assessments. The active surveillance, movement control and product specific biosecurity components of the SES plan provide a high degree of confidence that eggs and egg products from HPAI control areas are not contaminated and support animal disease control and food safety. The HPAI disease transmission models used in the proactive risk assessments are consistent with and developed in collaboratiion with an interagency workgroup for public health risk assessment for consumption of HPAI contaminated meat and eggs. This approach, combining production biosecurity, food safety and security, and animal health emergency response demonstrates the importance of coordination of risk management and risk mitigation decisions across multiple agencies and disciplines.",

The keeping of pet dogs and cats occurs on a vast scale in developed nations, but is also commonplace in developing countries where there is closer interrelationship between these species and wildlife and domestic production animals and poultry. Additionally, many developing nations face the vast public health issues related to stray dog and cat populations. These companion animals are closely integrated into family units worldwide and share the human domestic environment. There is already clear recognition of the importance of small companion animals as reservoirs for major zoonotic diseases such as rabies and leishmaniosis. However, the potential for these pet animal species to act as reservoirs for many emerging zoonoses is not fully appreciated. For example, the cat has been shown to be susceptible to SARS coronovirus, and both H5N1 and H1N1 influenza virus infections, and has the potential to act as a mammalian species for influenza virus reassortment, leading to novel human infections. Companion animals are also susceptible to infection by West Nile virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and others. The risk of emergent zoonotic infection in companion animals is now compounded by the unprecedented increase in the global movement of these species through international pet travel schemes. The WSAVA One Health Committee has a unique opportunity to impact in this area. The WSAVA Assembly provides the means of rapidly disseminating electronic information to a global network of frontline companion animal practitioners in all areas of the world. This communication network may prove invaluable in educating and advising in the face of any global infectious disease pandemic involving a companion animal reservoir. For this reason, the WSAVA One Health Committee includes representation from the CDC and OIE. More importantly this global network may act as an international disease surveillance network-providing early warning of disease clusters through national representatives back to the One Health Committee. Establishment of an effective global companion animal infectious disease surveillance network would require major investment, but should remain a key goal of the One Health community. Health data -whether it be diagnostic, surveillance, research or biosecurity related, exists in multiple diverse databases and other record keeping systems that are typically integrated poorly or not at all.",

Value chain analysis can provide information on volume, on type of products, on the people engaged, the relationships linking people, and the practices at each node. How these value chains operate is dictated by human behaviour and actions, which if understood provide critical insights into risk management. There are two benefits from looking more closely at the poultry value chains:",

Aside from many others, the so called 'viral hemorrhagic fevers' present a particular threat to our health systems. Most of the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fevers are zoonotic in origin and remain a major challenge for animal (wildlife, livestock) and human health worldwide. Many countries have established infectious disease centers with primary responsibility for disease surveillance, reference microbiology and quality assurance, and preparedness and response to these threat agents. However, the development of countermeasures is still in early stages and has not yet produced effective licensed products. This paper discusses the development of proper animal disease models and the utilization of live attenuated and replication-deficient vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by hantaviruses, filoviruses and arenaviruses. Despite promising vaccine candidates the mechanisms of protection remain largely unknown, but certain correlates of protection have been identified. Remaining issues such as safety and licensure are either currently addressed or need to be addressed in the future. The minimum goal would be the approval of emergency vaccines for the use in humans within the next few years.",

There are approximately 70 physicians for a population of 6 million persons, and only 5 veterinarians nationally with 21 livestock officers to assist them. This lack of human and animal health care capacity has handicapped zoonotic disease prevention and control, particularly for rabies, which is endemic in Sierra Leone. In 2007, the Animal Science Department of Njala University established Animal Health Clubs (AHCs) in five local schools as a One Health approach to empowering communities to improve their lives. AHCs provide basic training in animal husbandry, nutrition, sanitation, environmental hygiene, and the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, particularly canine rabies. In September 2010, with support from the Government of Sierra Leone and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Rabies Day activities were held nationally to support ongoing AHC health activities, including community participation, health education and theatre. AHCs provide a One Health model for community development under challenging conditions which may be adapted and applied in other developing nations.

Every reported calf with hemorrhagic syndrome was investigated: Blood samples were taken from the dam and the calf, and investigated for thrombocytes, leucocytes and blood parasites, and specific pathogens. When the calf died, necropsy was performed at the Animal Health Service in Deventer. The farmers and the veterinarians answered a questionnaire. The questions were focused on general information of the farm, the use of medication and vaccinations and routine management of the calves. All epidemiologic and diagnostic data were analysed. With international cooperation, many known infectious agents were ruled out. The calves developed the haemorrhagic disease, caused by a thrombocytopenia, because of bone marrow depletion. The exact cause of this depletion is still unknown, but the use of a certain vaccine in the dam, was identified as a very high risk factor. Further research is ongoing. Following these preliminary results, a specific vaccine was withdrawn from the European market. Emerging infectious diseases are a major challenge to the safety of the world in the 21st century. Renewed effort, resources, scientific innovations, as well as new degrees of scientific integration are required to meet this challenge. Animals are the source of more than 70% of these emerging infections. Outbreaks of avian influenza, SARS-CoV, Henipah and Ebola virus have often put negative focus on the role of wild animal populations in the transmission and maintenance of these emerging diseases. Whereas the focus often has been on the public health aspect of these emerging infectious diseases the environmental impact is equally important, with special concern for endangered wild animal populations.",

In the urban site, 11% of blood samples were positive for Bartonella species by isolation vs. 21% in the rural site. 18% of urban rodents tested positive for human pathogenic leptospires by PCR. Pathogen prevalence differed significantly by rodent species and trap site. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease highly endemic in Latin America, particularly in the Peruvian Andes. It is caused by the gastrointestinal parasite Echinococcus granulosus and its life cycle includes dogs, sheep and humans. Because of its close association with both animal species and people, this disease provides us with an excellent example for a One Health approach with inter-professional cooperation and thus, effective control measures should be aimed at both animal and human hosts alike. Our main initiatives in the highlands of Peru consist of designing a Knowledge Attitude and Practices (KAP) survey to identify potential risk factors predisposing infection in people and to design an appropriate control program. Control measures include treatment of dogs with praziquantel, health education and reduction of stray dog populations. Other goals include studying the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus in dogs and people as well as other zoonotic diseases harboured by dogs. This study incorporates intimate cooperative work between all health professionals at a local level and a strong interaction with at-risk populations. Preliminary results showed a very high prevalence of infection in humans and animals alike and ideal conditions for the transmission of the parasite from dogs to people and livestock, thus warranting a comprehensive approach to control the disease involving both physicians and veterinarians. Other factors favouring human infection include significant poverty, lack of education about CE and practices that are conductive to infection such as feeding infected sheep offal to dogs or the close interaction between children and pets.",

The aim of this study was to assess Leptospira prevalence in four wild mammal species in the French West Indies (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, Mus musculus and Herpestes auropunctatus) and the subsequent risk for humans and domestic animals. In 2000, wild mammals were trapped in different biotopes (with and without freshwater) and sampled for blood examination by serology (MAT) and for bacteriology (culture of kidneys and strain characterization (PFGE)). Evidence of leptospiral infection was found, by serology and/or isolation, in 65 (40%, 95% CI: 32.4-47.6) of the 160 animals investigated in Guadeloupe and 28 strains (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis, Sejroe and Ballum), were isolated from 71 noncontaminated cultures. This study pointed out that specificity between the host and Leptospira serogroups could be more (M. musculus and Ballum) or less strict (H. auropunctatus and Serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae, Sejroe or Australis). The presence of leptospires appeared to be determined by the availability of freshwater in the habitat. This is the first report of bacteriological and serological findings in wild mammals of the island. Four common species of Guadeloupean wild fauna were shown to extensively excrete leptospires of the main serogroups encountered in human and animal infections. These wild mammals widely infest leisure (forest) and working areas (banana and sugar cane plots), where workers are usually without any protection, but also houses (e.g. mice). This situation implies a need for prophylactic health measures.",

Actions taken to minimise contamination can cause physiological stress, and it has been shown that sub-lethal stress can augment L. monocytogenes virulence and may facilitate persistent contamination. This study aimed to compare the mechanisms facilitating persistent contamination by L. monocytogenes strains recovered from a food factory survey. Isolates recovered from a food factory were characterised using multilocus typing. Relevant attributes thought to enable persistent environmental contamination were compared, including biofilm production and the proteomics of alkaline stress adaptation. Biofilm production during temperature/pH stress was assessed by colourimetric assay and electron microscopy. A temperature response was observed, as was environmentally induced homogeneous biofilm production by non-clonal L. monocytogenes strains. Importantly, it was concluded that biofilm production does not determine the persistent L. monocytogenes phenotype. Qualitative and relative protein abundances following alkaline adaptation were compared using MudPIT. Findings showed alkaline adaptation involves cytoplasmic acidification, energy and cell wall adjustment, and stabilisation of cellular processes. No difference in these mechanisms was evident between strains; however the response was greater in persistent contaminants. Results of this study imply food facilities can induce/ select for the persistent L. monocytogenes phenotype. This may be caused by operational complexity within these facilities, leading to concentration fluxes of growth limiting challenges, and subjecting the strains to sub-lethal stresses. This requires consideration when assessing food factory operations, and for the development of effective risk mitigation strategies. At the time, the two forms of human disease where threatening to converge in the north of the country, which would have resulted in a public health nightmare. The programme facilitates control of human disease through an innovative community-based livestock spraying intervention known as ''restricted application technique'' (RAP). Combining scientific research with corporate and local commercial interests, SOS has grown into a significant partnership between the Ugandan government, medics, veterinarians, academia and the private sector, resulting in local business creation and significant institutional and policy change in Uganda.

After 9 Years and Challenges Ahead Dato Dr. C.P.Ramachandran Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a vector-borne, chronically disabling parasitic infection causing Elephentiasis, Lymphedema, and Hydrocele. The infection is endemic in 83 Countries worldwide, with more than 1.2 billion people at risk and 120 million already infected. Since the year 2000 the global programme to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) has targeted elimination of LF by the year 2020. In its first 9 operational years, the programme has scaled-up to provide more than 2.7 billion treatments through annual, single dose mass drug administration (MDA) to over 695 million individuals living in 52 LF-Endemic countries. Not only the GPELF drugs prevent the spread of LF, they also stop the progression of disease in those already infected, especially in children. In addition, since two of the three drugs used for LF elimination have broad anti-parasitic properties, treated populations are also freed from both intestinal worms and from skin infections with Onchocerca, lice and scabies. To better understand the public health benefit of this ongoing global health initiative an analysis was made of the programme data made available to W.H.O. by participating countries. Between 2000-2009 GPELF prevented LF disease in an estimated 8.7 million newborns who would otherwise have acquired LF, Thus averting in their lifetime nearly 6.6 million cases of Hydrocele, 4.1 million cases of Lymphedema and sub-clinical disfase. In conclusion conservative estimates show that the GPELD has had an unprecedented public health impact on both LF and other neglected tropical diseases and it justly deserves the accolade of ''a best buy'' in global health. The challenges ahead will also be discussed. Hydatidosis, a neglected zoonosis, is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. Adult E. granulosus parasites live in the intestine of dogs. Eggs expelled with faeces are infective to a wide range of animals, including man. Dogs are infected through predation or scavenging. Human hydatidosis is a severe chronic disease that often requires surgical treatment. Though various control tools are available, hydatidosis remains a heavy burden in many developing countries where extensive sheep breeding is practiced.",

This has considerable impact on the population dynamics and ecology of many Australian species of waterfowl, which are thought to form the reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIV) but may also be important carriers (and possibly reservoirs) of other diseases (e.g. bursal disease, Newcastle disease). During the wet, waterfowl numbers increase with many serologically naive juveniles entering the population. During the subsequent period of drought, bird densities increase in the few remaining wetlands. We hypothesise that it is during this period of increasing densities of naive birds that the population's viral prevalence of some infectious diseases may increase dramatically. Indeed, there exists a remarkable and suggestive coincidence between outbreaks of fowl plaque and Newcastle disease in Australian poultry farms and the periods of drought following a very wet period. In other words, we suspect a link between increased risk for disease outbreaks in poultry farms and the hypothesised high in the prevalences of the viruses causing these diseases in waterfowl. Given that poultry farms may provide ideal conditions for development of high-pathogenic strains, there is also a reciprocal risk for wildlife involved during these periods.",

VPH is also an essential discipline to address endemic or so-called ''neglected zoonotic diseases'' through its systematic, multidisciplinary focus and better management of interactions between humans, animals and the environment. Through the One Health approach, VPH has expanded beyond strictly veterinary limitations to engage resources of public health and hygiene in a more effective manner, engaging a variety of sectors and professionals.

Following challenge pigs were monitored daily for disease and viral shedding.

Evidence of virus shedding and replication of virus in internal organs in the absence of clinical disease represents a potential risk to farm, veterinary, and abattoir workers.

After understanding and mastering the basic concepts of biology, pathology, and medicine through comparative medicine approach, student doctors recognize early their professional role in public health arena: emergence of zoonotic diseases; bio-and agroterrorism threats; international veterinary medicine; animals, especially wildlife, as sentinels for human health; farm animal industry with large scale food safety challenges that include residues, zoonotic agents, and contaminants; bioaccumulation of the pollutants and heavy metals; human-animal bond that brings various animal species in the close contact with people. Historically, veterinary medicine recognizes its role in global health (veterinarian's oath), but the recognition from the public health domain, and especially human medicine, is very slow and sporadic. In the light of recent zoonotic disease outbreaks and new health challenges in the modern world, there is a need for change. With the political and scientific support, the education needs to take a leadership role in bridging the gap between different medical professions. Policymaking needs to start with education, and centered team approach is the key. Industry and organizations (CDC, WHO, AFIP), public/animal health centers and MPH programs should follow by re-structuring their internship and externship programs with this more inclusive interprofessional team-approach. One novel model already exists: Interprofessional Education program at Western University of Health Sciences (USA) with two objectives: awareness of interprofessional teamwork and all inclusive approach to different medical professions centered around global health issues via Problem Based Learning. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI H5N1) is a recognized threat to the global community and continues to have a severe impact in several developing countries. Indonesia is one of these with over 794 HPAI outbreaks in poultry and a case fatality rate of 83% among the 168 confirmed human cases. Realising the cost and risk of ongoing outbreaks, the aim of this research was to identify high-risk movements and practices for HPAI among chickens and ducks in Bali and Lombok -Indonesia. As part of this research, we investigated community perceptions of HPAI through interviews with 618 respondents (poultry vendors, collectors, and buyers) at 17 live bird markets in Bali and Lombok during 2008-2009. The results highlight unfavourable community perceptions toward HPAI and recommended biosecurity measures, to practices related to the management of sick and dead birds and to the management of birds during transportation and at live bird markets, activities that pose a high transmission risk. In Lombok, an island that has not experienced extensive poultry outbreaks, poultry vendors and collectors considered HPAI to be ''not significant'' and ''only seen on TV''. Respondents in Bali and Lombok reported consumption of sick birds to be safe and considered mixing birds of different species and from different sources to not be problematic. A positive perception in terms of biosecurity along the market chain was a strong preference for purchasing healthy birds. Reducing HPAI at source and preventing its spread through the market chain requires extension targeting these perceptions.",

This is not the observed occurrence, and might intuitively be plausibly explained by the overall decreasing density of flying foxes from north to south. However, if the geographic occurrence of equine incidents only reflects probability of effective contact, high horse density in parts of central NSW should still have supported Hendra incidents to date, notwithstanding a lower flying fox density. Similarly in Queensland, on the basis of horse density alone, there should have been a greater proportion of incidents in SEQ than FNQ, whereas the observed proportions are more or less equal.

Collaboration between health, agriculture and food-safety agencies is necessary to detect and prevent foodborne diseases. In 2000, the Australian Government established a national network-OzFoodNet-to enhance surveillance of foodborne diseases. Prior to the establishment of the network, there was no formalised national surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks or systematic analysis of notification data. We examined the burden of foodborne disease using information from applied research, disease surveillance, and foodborne disease outbreaks. 5.4 million cases of foodborne disease were estimated to occur annually, costing society $AUD1.2 billion. To learn about the causes of foodborne disease, the network conducted case control studies, such as Shiga Toxin producing E. coli associated with eating hamburgers and working with animals; and hyper-endemic Salmonella Mississippi in Tasmania transmitted from drinking untreated water and contact with native animals and birds. The network conducted surveillance of over 1000 foodborne disease outbreaks throughout Australia, highlighting trends in high-risk foods and settings. These included emergences of Salmonella outbreaks associated with eggs, and outbreaks associated with internationally-distributed foods, including sesame-seed products, oysters and semidried tomatoes. Collaboration with Food Standards Australia New Zealand and other government agencies have proven important for the development of food safety policy. Australia has participated in international collaborations to understand the burden of foodborne disease and strengthen food safety, as well as international outbreak investigations. Networks are an important means of strengthening surveillance to prevent foodborne diseases. A key economic driver behind southern African transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) is nature-based tourism that seeks to maximize returns from marginal lands in a sector where southern Africa enjoys a global comparative advantage. Naturebased tourism (photographic safaris, trophy hunting, etc.) now contributes about as much to the GDP of southern Africa as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries combined -a remarkable and relatively recent development documented by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, the management of wildlife and livestock diseases (including zoonoses) within the envisaged larger transboundary landscapes remains unresolved and an emerging policy issue of major concern to livestock production, associated access to export markets, and other sectors, including public health, in the region. Essentially, the TFCA concept and current internationally accepted approaches to the management of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) are largely incompatible. The TFCA concept promotes free movement of wildlife over large geographic areas, whereas the present approach to the control of TADs is to use vast fences to prevent movement of susceptible animals between areas where TADs occur and areas where they do not, and to similarly restrict trade in commodities derived from animals. A new policy paradigm is needed to help resolve the incompatibility between (a) current regulatory approaches for the control of diseases of agro-economic importance and (b) the vision of vast conservation landscapes without major fences-now that SADC countries have chosen to pursue transfrontier conservation initiatives in the interest of regional risk-diversification of land-use options and livelihood opportunities.",

Following a recommendation of the Chadian Ministries of Health and of Livestock Production as well as mobile pastoralist communities, we have facilitated the implementation and assessed the feasibility and costs of joint human and livestock vaccination services in communities who previously were not covered by public health services, but where livestock vaccination was done regularly. A team of physicians and veterinarians shared transportation and cold chain to reach the remote families during several campaigns. Next to vaccination, other health services were offered on the sites, including appropriate information. Combined health and veterinary vaccination reduced operational costs and were highly valued by all partners involved, particularly the livestock keeping families. Based on the positive outcomes of these pilot campaigns, Chadian public health and veterinary officials had workshops to discuss policy formulation on integrated services in rural areas. By optimizing the use of limited logistical and human resources, public health and veterinary services can be strengthened, especially at the district level.",

A multi-disciplinary team with expertise in veterinary epidemiology, wildlife medicine and ecology, animal health, human health, sociology, economics and communication developed applied modular training methods and materials based on specific learning objectives and problem based learning exercises including case studies. A total of sixty participants from human health, agriculture and environmental sectors from nine countries participated in both training modules. Evaluation of teaching methods and relevance to participants was conducted. Thirty-one of 35 (88%) participants agreed or strongly agreed that the Animal-Human-Environmental interface training would contribute to improved multi-sectoral collaboration and 28 of 33 (85%) respondents indicated that the module was relevant to current situations and needs in their respective countries. Eleven of 11 (100%) and nine of 11 (75%) respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the Socio-Economic-Communications module lectures either was useful or that exercises increased their awareness, respectively. Classroom exercises and case studies will need to be further adjusted to address feedback and suggestions from participants and trainers.

However, contaminated poultry is a transmission factor in humans for which Campylobacter is most common cause of gastroenteritis. Therefore the presence of drug resistant strains in poultry might provide a niche for the spread of antibiotic resistant human infections. This study describes the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of chicken isolates of Campylobacter jejuni. A total of 600 chicken cloacal swabs, collected from different poultry farms were screened. Isolates were characterized for antibiotic susceptibility and analyzed for integron analysis and resistant determinants of commonly available drugs. 81% samples were found positive with Campylobacter jejuni, of them resistance against tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, sulfonamides and erythromycin was high. In agreement with R-phenotype, they possessed class I integron with 1650 bp variable region assorting R-cassettes for tetracyline and sulfonamide. Further characterization revealed amino acid substitution at 6 different places in QRDR and downstream region of gyrA gene pertaining fluroquinolone resistance. Out of them 3; L133F, V149I and A157 V are first time observed. Erythromycin resistance (MIC > 32 lg/ml) was observed in 18% cases with 3 different mechanisms including A2075G mutation in DMV region of 23SrRNA, V80I and V121Ala amino acid substitutions in rplD gene leading to structural modification in L4 ribosomal protein which provides the first evidence for the role of L4 ribosomal protein modification equally important with change in DMV region for R-type.

However, despite intensive surveillance, we still know very little about the role individual wild birds (and their populations) play in the transmission and maintenance of these viruses. Traditionally, combinations of single-location surveillance and historical migration patterns have been used to estimate the degree to which different species may be involved. However, this broad scale approach tends to neglect the ecology of the virus, and just as importantly, the ecology of the host. Over 100 species have been found infected with these viruses worldwide, with many more purportedly negative for the disease. Using data from ten years of wild bird surveillance in the Netherlands we catalogued the ecological properties of each species sampled, in order to determine whether infected species are ecologically separated from those that are not. Using stable isotope analysis of feathers and blood components, we also examine whether infection risk of individuals within a species known to be infected by AIV can be attributable to antecedent foraging habitats. The use of an aquatic habitat is strongly associated with infection risk at all levels analysed, including individuals and populations of a single species, and between species. These unique findings underscore the usefulness of stable isotope methods in disease ecology, particularly when compared to broader-scale inter-species patterns, and the potential role of host ecology in transmission and maintenance of AIV.",

Few studies focus specifically on bats, which may be why bats are so under-represented in bushmeat projects. This study began to answer a few of unknown questions about bats as bushmeat, including the discovery of an extensive trade system for bat meat that stretches more than 400 km across south-eastern Ghana. Our interviews also helped to identify ''risk factors'' for contact with bats. Members of certain regions, rather than of certain tribes, are more likely to hunt and consume bats; bat consumption also may increase with increasing age. Various hunting and butchering methods may increase the likelihood of contact with bat blood and therefore increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. Understanding the human groups at risk of pathogen transfer, the possible modes of transfer, and the importance of bushmeat meat socially and economically are all crucial to developing efficient and effective management plans.",

These diseases emerge from wildlife or livestock, and include HIV/AIDS, SARS, H5N1 avian influenza and the new H1N1 strain of flu. Diseases emerge when environmental and demographic changes alter our relationship with animals, and provide new ways for pathogens to spread to people. Despite recent outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 and H1N1, the world's pandemic prevention strategy fails to take the broader view as it focuses so intensely on the machinations of each strain, and on the politics of surveillance, reporting, and trade regulation. For zoonotic diseases the key factors that drive their emergence are a combination of human changes to the environment, agriculture, healthcare, and changes in demography, all against a background of a large pool of potential new zoonoses. The EcoHealth Alliance is fostering the growth of a collaborative initiative across Bangladesh and India among both ministry officials and scientists. The initial step was a meeting with high-level officials that helped identified mid-career decision-makers in the relevant ministries (Wildlife/Forestry, Health, Agriculture), in universities, research institutes and NGOs across India and Bangladesh who are interested in this critical issue. To bring these people together, we organized the 1st South Asian Transboundary Conservation Medicine Network meeting West Bengal, India during 4-6 November 2009 and drafted the One Health Alliance of South Asia (OHASA) Bengal Declaration. We are working with the relevant authorities to propose a strategy to prevent the spillover of these pathogens by advising wildlife traders of the risk of infection and working with them to find alternative solutions to high-risk activities. The objective of this symposia is to present the advances and current perspectives of OHASA of building a long-term cross-border collaboration in emerging diseases and one health. We hope that OHASA will serve as the basis to combat emerging infectious diseases in South Asia and represents a key example for other countries to work collaboratively to predict and prevent the next pandemic.",

Expectedly, recent instances of intersectoral collaboration at national and sub-national levels were materialized in the wake of crisis situations like H5N1, SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. Recently, recognition of interconnectedness of various sectors has grown thus giving support to this call to coordinated action. Several mechanisms are being explored to promote these linkages in routine settings including in policy formulation, research, outbreak response and control of endemic zoonoses like rabies. An environment of strong political will, evidence-based policy innovations, clearly defined roles and responsibilities of agencies, coordination mechanisms at all levels, and a culture of open information exchange rooted in the ''One Health'' approach have been observed as the factors contributing to early success of these models.",

The country has a high density of human population with wide spread poverty in particular in rural areas. The high animal and human density has brought human and animal population in very close proximity creating potential threat of transmission of disease agents from animal hosts to human host. Major diseases having zoonotic and economic importance frequently noticed in the country are Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Newcastle Disease (NCD), Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD), Anthrax, Rabies, Brucellosis,Tuberculosis, Salmonellosis, etc. Furthermore protozoal and diseases caused by different type of worms are common in the country. Bangladesh has experienced many outbreaks of Nipah and Nipah like diseases. Among the zoontic diseases the presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza was first declared by the Government of Bangladesh in 22 nd March 2010. Since then 358 outbreaks have been recorded in Bangladesh. Out of these 358 outbreaks, 54 occurred in backyard settings and the rest 304 outbreaks occurred in commercial setting. The highest number of outbreaks were observed in 2008 and the number of outbreaks reduced in the following years. It appears from the pattern of last outbreak that most of the outbreak occurred during winter season. A single human case was detected in the country in 22 nd June, 2008 but the affected boy was recovered. Anthrax is a century old problem in Bangladesh. An outbreak of human case were detected in the northern part of Bangladesh. An animal anthrax case was reported in 19 August from Shahjadpur subdistrict of Serajganj district. Since then 8 districts and 18 upazilas were affected. Awareness meetings were held, communication materials distributed, check points instituted, multisectoral committees formed to control and contain the spread of the disease.

A major focus for this Committee will be addressing the key position of small companion animals as reservoir populations for zoonotic infectious disease and the potential for these species to be involved in the emergence of new pandemics. However, the second remit of the committee will be to promote the importance of comparative medicine and the major insights that might be achieved through study of spontaneously arising disease in small companion animals. To date the wide spectrum of human degenerative, neoplastic and immune-mediated diseases has been modelled using experimental rodent systems. This diseases in such models must often be induced by experimental manipulation or genetic modification. The value of comaparative studies in small companion animals, particularly the domestic dog, has not been fully appreciated. The dog is a relatively long-lived species that may spontaneously develop the full range of idiopathic diseases that affect man. This in part relates to the fact that pet dogs are now fully integrated into the domestic environment and share numerous human lifestyle factors that predispose to such diseases. For example, the single most significant health-related issue facing the human and canine populations in developed nations is obsesity. The neoplastic, allergic, autoimmune and age-related degenerative diseases of the dog are extremely close clinical and pathological mimics of the equivalent human disorders. In recent years there has been rapid development of the scientific tools for the study of canine disease, including gene expression and snp microarray technology permitting large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). The major advantage of investigating the genomic basis of disease in the canine model is the fact that the diseases of interest are often tightly breed-associated and that the phenotypic characteristics of dog breeds have been achieved through close inbreeding -meaning that canine breeds are also genetically restricted. These advantages have been recognized by establishment of the European LUPA consortium that is currently investigating the genetic basis of a series of canine diseases that are models for the equivalent human disorders. The WSAVA has long recognized the benefits to be gained from refining the phenotypic definition of small companion animal disease and has established expert panels to address the classifciation of diseases affecting the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. The WSAVA One Health Committee will continue to promote comparative medicine and will work to bring together stakeholders from the veterinary and medical research communities and funding bodies that might support such comparative research.",

There is a need to promote and maintain ethical awareness among life scientists about the security implications of their work, while acknowledging that it can (and usually does) serve a broader health purpose. The challenge for governments and the scientific profession is to reduce biological weapons risks while maximizing the research output necessary to resist infectious diseases. A possible solution to this governance dilemma is the formulation and adoption of an Australian Code of Conduct on Biosecurity. The Australian Government takes a traditional, 'top-down' approach to risk reduction by enforcing legislation including the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976 and the National Health Security Act 2007. Legal mechanisms aimed at preventing the harmful misuse of pathogens may be necessary, but they are not sufficient. The law does not (and probably cannot) offer guidance for scientists deciding, for example, whether to pursuing particular lines of research or communicate research results. These are best regarded as ethical rather than legal issues. A biosecurity code of conduct would be a 'bottom-up' governance mechanism, sensitive but not beholden to the interests of scientists. It would provide a framework for decision-making in such areas as: education and awareness-raising, dual-use aspects of research and publication, and internal accountability and oversight.

The powerful spirit of lots of encouraging meetings must now be transformed into the development of a sustainable 'one health' strategy on a global and a multitude of local platforms. Our study aimed at determining the opportunities of implementing the 'one health' concept as a mutual strategy for a better integrated health system in a small and assessable country like Switzerland. 18 participants, selected from a range of stakeholders, opinion leaders and policy makers in the field of human, animal and environmental health in Switzerland were involved in this study by using semi-structured in-depth interviews in the period of April to July, 2010. The personal contact of the author with these most relevant key experts stimulated their interest in 'one health'. The interviews led to identifying areas where such an integrated approach already exists and/or could be developed. They also revealed administrative and cultural barriers. The results led to the conclusion that, despite a broad acceptance of the concept, finding leaders who are committed to boost the concept will remain a challenging task. Building bridges between sectors and disciplines requires a subtle and empathic approach. In order to successfully put the idea of 'one health' into action, a framework of relevant stakeholders and a road map for future activities are needed. The experiences and lessons learnt in Switzerland will be of interest to other countries and help communicate and further promote the 'one health' concept.

Country level needs assessments have been conducted in South and Southeast Asia since 2008 to support curriculum development for a regional veterinary field epidemiology training program.

These particular drivers correspond to environments or land use zones in which diversity of species is reduced but number of individuals of the selected species are increased. This increases the epidemic potential of suitable pathogens where they arise. Diseases of and from wildlife are a particular concern as species adapt to these human modified environments. Equally disturbing is the loss of biodiversity, driven primarily by natural habitat loss; loss of productive land to urbanization; and the growth of energy intensive cities in which the majority of the world's population live, often in substandard conditions. Considerable co-benefits are likely to be associated with efforts to decrease environmental potential for emerging infectious diseases.

Under Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED 2005), a unique zoonoses framework has been developed to guide collaboration between human and animal health sectors. This framework can be used to address any zoonotic disease events and emergencies. It covers all areas of work including risk reduction, surveillance for information sharing, coordinated response, and collaborative research. Rather than calling the establishment of a new programme, the framework strengthens links between human and animal health sectors, clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each and take advantages of the resource and expertise within existing structures. As both sectors continue to build capacity within their own fields, the zoonoses framework avoids duplication to create a practical and sustainable coordination mechanism. A joint Guide has been published by WHO, FAO and OIE in 2008 . Countries implementing the Guide for example in Laos and Mongolia, has experienced successful response and coordinated actions for risk reduction interventions to anthrax. In Philippines, the mechanism has brought the two sectors together to contain Ebola reston in pig population quickly with further collaboration in research to identify natural reservoirs and possible mode of disease transmission. The coordination mechanism is the way forward to manage zoonoses risk at the human-animal interface. Under APSED 2010 and within the concept of ''One Health'' the coordination mechanism will further be strengthen and link with food safety, environment, wildlife and other relevant sectors. Global health security (GHS) implies a marked reduction in the disease burden in humans and animals, old and new. The proposed and currently developing FAO contribution to the initiative requires effective emergency response mechanisms to redress new outbreaks and endemic disease burdens and, ultimately, will have to address the root causes of disease emergence at the human-animal-environment (HAE) interface. The latter implies a broadening of the health management approach to incorporate the notion that health security cannot be viewed in isolation from the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In much of the developing world, food and health security are critical to the livelihoods of the more vulnerable groups in society (MDG 1 and 3) . Similarly, health management applies to husbandry and marketing practices in food and agriculture, thereby improving maternal and child health and the fight against diseases (MDGs 4, 5 and 6). A more robust health management and secure safe supplies of food not disrupted by market shocks, outbreaks or natural disasters. There will be a need to clarify the drivers of disease flare-up at the HAE interface, critical control points along complex food chains, farming landscapes and ecosystems, thus GSH also includes incorporation of the natural resource base for wildlife and ecosystem health (MDG 7 and 8). Successful management of all interactions would lead sustainable disease control strategies adapted from an ecosystem approach. Finally, enhancing health management adequate to achieving GHS requires collaboration and partnerships, from local to global (MDG 8). FAO, OIE and WHO are leading by example.",

We validate the added value of ''one health'' through practical implementation: By a ''one health'' approach: A) The detection of sources of emerging zoonoses is accelerated by joint human and animal survey design. B) In an African city we can show that rabies control in dogs is more cost-effective than human post-exposure treatment after 6 years. C) If all benefitting sectors contribute to the cost of control, brucellosis mass vaccination in Mongolian livestock becomes highly profitable to public health and to society as a whole. D) Joint animal and public health services serve children and women with preventive and curative interventions in remote rural areas not covered otherwise by public health. These examples show clearly an added value of cooperation compared to both medicines working separately. Evidence for an economic, social and ecological added value of inter-sectoral collaboration between animal and human health serves as a ''blue print'' for work claiming to be under a ''one health'' paradigm, allowing identifying points of leverage improving animal and public health. Examples are: Joint surveillance of communicable diseases, Joint cancer registries for animals and humans, Integrated surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, Joint health services and packaged integrated control of zoonoses.",

Global environmental change, globalization, economic growth and increased demand for food and energy; increased travel and migration -these drivers are complicating disease control and public health on many different fronts. Achieving changes in these areas has requires collaborative and coordinated action from more than just health and agricultural sectors -there implications for finance, education, planning, and more.

Zoonotic threats in food have also emerged as a major concern for the country. The efforts made by Vietnam to mitigate the impact of these health problems and improve health and well-being of people and animals have been evaluated positively by the international community. However, these efforts still lack coordination and inter-sectoral collaborations between related fields of expertise. We present here the current practice of managing zoonoses in Vietnam on the one hand, and on the other hand propose an EcoHealth framework to better manage zoonotic threats in the food system. In this approach, research, evidence-based interventions, and management of zoonotic food-borne diseases are conceived from interdisciplinary spirit combining human and animal health, environmental and social perspectives. Such an approach requires cross-sectoral collaboration from related fields such as health, agriculture, commerce, education and involvement of the communities with socially and culturally accepted measures for intervention tailored to local context. The challenge of applying an EcoHealth approach in developing country settings is also presented.",

Diversified wild bird species including the global endangered or threatened species have been killed by these viruses. The outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Qinghai lake China in 2005, caused the death of thousands of wild birds, especially the bar-headed goose. Qinghai Lake may become the natural epidemic disease reservoir of this AI because they may maintain the viruses and spread them through wild bird migration, of course, the lake may also face the risk of this disease. This suggests wild birds and their habitats especially waterfowls and wetlands conservation are seriously challenged by HPAI H5N1 prevalence, and a conservation strategy in maintaining the eco-health of this International Important wetland is urgently necessary. The risk for introduction of H5N1 in and out of the Qinghai Lake was revealed that it would be high during spring (April and May) and autumn (September and October), however, species diversity and abundance were different at each location around the Lake. The results finally recommended the conservation priority in geospatial perspective under the eco-health program. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been confirmed in multiple countries in West and East Africa, yet to date, southern Africa has remained free of the disease. With its dependence on imported food products -including poultry, promotion of and extensive intraregional trade patterns, locally porous borders and limited resources to enforce disease control regulations, it is crucial to public authority efforts to prevent entry of the disease into the region that they are focused on those highest risk points. But with so many products entering the region and then quickly being redistributed, how does one analyze this market-driven 'shell game'?",

Partners included the Department of Livestock Services, Dhaka City Corporation, market committees, transporters serving the markets, and the private market vendors. The objectives were to institutionalize a feebased cleaning program to reduce viral load, minimize the spread of HPAI, and document lessons learned to share with the FAO and others working on similar efforts. STOP AI provided, on a cost-sharing basis with the partners, spraying equipment, cleaning materials, waterlines, drainage, and electricity infrastructure, trained group leaders and vendors on C&D procedures, and provided oversight in preparation for the winter 2009 peak season for HPAI. The program demonstrated the benefits of C&D to the market committees managing the markets, the market vendors, and operators of delivery vehicles. Prior to the C&D program, stall cleaning in both markets consisted of sweeping and washing only with water and spraying disinfectant directly on live birds or organic matter, neither of which is an effective means of preventing HPAI. Previously, no vehicle C&D took place in the markets. The most significant lesson learned was that securing assurance of the local governments and the market committees to supply C&D service was not adequate to institutionalize the service. Continued demand for C&D from the vendors and drivers who accepted the value of the service was essential.",

The containment of HPAI has been constrained by high population density in key Delta poultry production areas, weak biosecurity practices, ineffective enforcement and movement controls, and inadequate responses by the GoE. The result has been a significant absence of trust between the GoE and the industry. STOP AI bridged the gap by organizing workshops with many of the largest producers and key GoE officials to discuss the regulatory environment and ways to reduce the HPAI threat. As a result the GoE is reconsidering several regulations that producers claim are ineffective and unrealistic such as minimum distance between production units, and requiring vehicle drive-through dips for vehicles. The producers also voiced objection to the regulation that existing farms must move to meet the regulatory minimum distance of 500 meters between production units. The workshop discussions also revealed discontent among producers of biosecurity standards required to obtain an operating license. The regulations go well beyond internationally recognized best practice, may be ineffective, and may not be feasible for many producers. This results in numerous unlicensed producers essentially making them invisible to GoE health and safety authorities. It is a significant barrier to cooperation among poultry producers and between producers and the GoE. Another promising outcome has been the agreement by the large producers and GoE representatives to participate in a series of STOP AI facilitated meetings in October and November establish consensus on meaningful and realistic biosecurity standards.",

As compared to so-called ''safe'', mass-produced industrial poultry products, the Vietnamese public generally prefers the taste and texture of ''traditionally-raised'' native poultry grown under ''backyard'' conditions (where disease and food hygiene are highly unpredictable). This STOP AI activity has established a number of integrated poultry supply chains which provide the discriminating consumer with the right combination of poultry ''taste + quality + safety'' coming from semi-confined, free-range production systems. Project training in production efficiency and biosecurity suppress HPAI (and many other diseases) and give the farmers potential for higher profits. Food safety testing and marketing support are also provided. The STOP AI project and the farmers have also co-invested in small-scale hygienic slaughterhouses and cold chain transport, which enable more direct selling to retailers. Products coming from these supply chains are branded with a project logo -''Naturally Vietnam'' -and only farmers internally certified by the project are permitted to sell under this private label. Our paper will examine how this activity seeks to convince the Government and private sector that increased investment in certifiable schemes for safe native products, coupled with increased enforcement against unsafe/uncertified products and slaughterhouses, are valuable tools to be employed in the re-structuring of Vietnam's poultry industry in an HPAI environment.",

Interventions were carried out in partnership with live bird market and producer associations and with local municipal government. STOP AI provided, among other items, initial supplies of cleaning and disinfection equipment, model metal cages for holding birds in the markets, and plastic poultry transportation cages that could be easily cleaned and disinfected. Participating markets and model farms were then used as in situ training facilities for poultry sellers, transporters and producers, with support from STOP AI-trained national consultants. Target outcomes included; establishment of improved biosecurity measures in the sales and processing areas of LBM's to reduce potential human exposure to H5N1 virus, formation of cadres of informed marketers and producers capable of disseminating biosecurity messages among fellow association members, and thereby wide-scale introduction of low cost, effective biosecurity measures across the smallholder poultry sector. Challenges, opportunities and lessons learned regarding formation and use of private sector and municipal government partnerships to reduce disease risk are highlighted and discussed. Recent studies in Indonesia indicate that commercial production is a major vehicle for H5N1 transmission among poultry and from poultry to people. Therefore, being able to engage and motivate private sector farmers is critical for reducing disease threat to humans, food sources, and livestock. Between 2008-2010, the USAID-funded Community-Based Avian Influenza Control Project (CBAIC) developed and tested models to reduce the risk of H5N1 transmission in Indonesian commercial poultry through training, one-on-one technical assistance, and farm commodity support. This approach was implemented in 330 broiler farms with total annual production of 17 million birds in West Java, an area reporting the majority of H5N1 cases in animals and humans in Indonesia.",

Notable reminders of just how vulnerable the increasingly interconnected world is to such diseases have emerged in recent decades. They include HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 avian influenza, and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. The speed with which these diseases can surface and spread presents serious public health, economic, and development concerns.

The EPT program draws on expertise from across the animal-and human-health sectors to build regional, national, and local capacities for early disease detection, laboratory-based disease diagnosis, rapid disease response and containment, and risk reduction. These efforts target a limited number of geographic areas, known as ''hot spots'', where new disease threats have emerged in the past. In this symposium, the panel and participants, will discuss the investments and issues involved with moving towards a global surveillance and response system for emerging zoonotic diseases, including a ''One Health'' strategy for wildlife pathogen discovery, risk determination through the use of geo-temporal models, and strengthening capacities for investigating and responding to disease outbreaks. Work over the past two decades has shown that the process of zoonotic disease emergence is essentially an ecological one in which anthropogenic factors drive the spillover and spread of wildlife microbes in human hosts. Because these 'drivers' of emergence are measurable, and to some extent their future trajectory is known, analysing them provides a basis from which to predict the patterns of future zoonotic disease emergence. In this talk, I present an approach to identify the regions where the next emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are most likely to emerge (EID 'hotspots') and our current efforts to refine our recently published work (Jones et al. Nature 2008), with updated driver data, and new analyses. Using data on human travel and trade patterns we can take this strategy further by identifying the hotspot regions which are most likely to propagate the spread of a new EID. This research may provide a cost-effective strategy for pandemic prevention, by allowing us to allocate global resources to the regions where the next pandemic is most likely to originate. The large sets of data on zoonotic disease risk and pathogen discovery to be collected through the USAID EPT program will provide a unique opportunity to test the efficacy of this approach. As part of this strategy, we have set up a series of large-scale transects across disease 'hotspots' where our USAID-funded 'PREDICT' group is conducting targeted wildlife surveillance. These surveillance transects represent gradients of deforestation, population density, biodiversity (of hosts and pathogens), agricultural intensification, and other factors that are important in disease emergence. The aim of this approach is to ultimately produce far more accurate predictions of where the next emerging zoonoses are most likely to originate, and from which species of wildlife.",

Rapid human population growth and environmental changes have resulted in increased numbers of people living in close contact with animals. The resulting increased contact has altered the ecological balance between pathogens and their human and animal hosts. We have built a One Health team with a SMART (Strategic, Measurable, Adaptive, Responsive, and Targeted) surveillance vision responsive to the fact that zoonotic pathogens account for the majority of emerging infectious diseases in people, and that more than three quarters of these are the result of wildlife-origin pathogens. Our approach employs integrated risk modelling, molecular diagnostics, and intensive field studies to detect novel diseases with pandemic potential early, giving health professionals the best opportunity to prevent emergence or control epidemics at the source of spill-over. It also targets important sentinel species at active human interfaces in hotspot regions to improve surveillance efficiencies. Our targeted and adaptive wildlife disease surveillance system includes the introduction of new technologies at the local level, as well as the use of cutting-edge information management and communication tools with the potential to bring the world closer to realizing an integrated, global approach to emerging zoonotic diseases. Our team is assisting in the development of global capacity to monitor diseases at the animal-human interface and has implemented a risk-based approach to concentrate efforts in surveillance, prevention, and response at the most critical points for disease emergence from wildlife. Hormonal control of reproduction is common in human and veterinary medicine. For example, hormonal manipulation is a key tool for zoo and wildlife veterinarians to manage animal populations. Yet in animal and human applications, contraception is not without risks. The Contraception Health Surveillance Program (CHSP), associated with the Wildlife Contraceptive Center at the St. Louis Zoo (http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/scienceresearch/contraceptioncenter/), has been collecting, evaluating, collating, and interpreting the findings from reproductive tracts from both contracepted and non-contracepted zoo mammals for over 20 years. For example, the progestin melengestrol acetate (MGA) has been effectively used in zoos for critical population control, with the understanding that safety and efficacy would be evaluated as the product was used. Recent CHSP studies have revealed elevated risks of mammary and uterine disease in big cats and severe uterine lesions in canids subjected to prolonged MGA use. This information has an immediate impact on the management of endangered species, but also provides valuable comparative data. Fully understanding the breadth of hormonal control mechanisms across species can impact the management of reproduction in many species, including humans, but may also demonstrate the pitfalls of inappropriate extrapolation between species. In the future, animal reproductive disease monitoring may also reveal the effects of hormonally active environmental contaminants. In summary, monitoring the reproductive health of zoo and wild animals not only impacts the effective and safe management of these often endangered populations, but also can provide powerful comparative insights into the effects of both regularly prescribed and inadvertent exposure to hormonally active compounds. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic disease that crosses national borders and leads to considerable public health and economic impact. It is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) and spreads over different climatic zones. There is a concern that RVF could spread further due to global climatic changes.",

However many infections can be transmitted through semen if not cared properly. There is high risk of infectious agents S138 Abstracts being transmitted between animals via the venereal route or by use of infected semen. For national and international trade the transport of genetic material in small frozen packages and with prolonged viability for the purpose of A.I. is convenient and advantageous. A condition of cryopreservation designed to prolong the life of spermatozoa also often prolongs the life of many infectious organisms too. This technique may result in potentially widespread dissemination of infectious diseases through cryopreserved semen. Semen can be contaminated by preputial smegma, skin, atmospheric contents and diluents. The different types of organisms encountered in the semen are Bacilli, Diptheriods, Micrococci, Coliform, Streptococci, Staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Actinomyces, Proteus, Yeast, Viral Agents and Mycoplasma etc. Other contagious organisms that infect cows through semen are Brucella, Vibrio, Trichomonas, Leptospira and Mycobacterium. Tuberculosis, John's disease and Brucellosis have been reported to be of great concern for human health which can be transmitted to human accidentally or due to unhygienic handling of infected semen at the time of A.I. The pathogenesis of these diseases involve all the body systems. Brucellosis and Tuberculosis are considered very important in semen due to their greater public health significance.

            "text": "The protection of human and animal health lies in combating with several emerging and re-emerging diseases from time to time. In recent years, both the species have suffered from several such diseases mostly as anthropozoonoses, Avian influenza virus (avian species to man), HIV 1 (primates to man), Sin Nombre virus and Hantaan virus (rodents to man), Ebola virus in monkeys, West Nile virus (birds to human), Nipah virus (bat to pig to human), Haniba virus (pigs and human) and monkey pox (rat to dog to man) are some of the examples. India too has witnessed such diseases in the form of outbreaks. Avian influenza has been a focus of both national and international concern due to its emergence as pandemic which has considerable economic impact on animal production as well as adverse effects on human health. Globally, Italy (1999 -2000 , Dutch (2003) and Canada (2004) have encountered serious epidemics. In India, the worst affected state West Bengal lost thousands of birds resulting in serious economic losses in 2007-2008. The emerging and re-emerging nature of the disease is attributed to nature of virus, its mutation, perpetuation in susceptible host and its transmission between animals and to human as well. Chikungunya and Dengue are the major re-emerging diseases in recent months which have become a serious problem to reckon with. The prevention and control of such diseases lies in serological, virological and biotechnological diagnostic capability, development of vaccines and breaking down the transmission mode by any means to protect human health. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), so named for its blood-curdling, nocturnal shrieks and snarls, is the largest of the carnivorous marsupials. Wild devil populations have crashed since the emergence of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), an invariably fatal tumour transmitted between devils by biting. Elegant cytogenetic and genomic experiments demonstrate that the infectious agent is the neoplastic cell itself. This somatic cell parasite exploits the devil's paucity of genetic diversity to out-manoeuvre the immune system, enabling tumour transmission by allograft. The emergence of DFTD has had a profound effect on the conservation status of the devil; populations have diminished by up to 90% with alarming rapidity and extinction is projected to occur within 25-35 years. This trend confounds prevailing theory, which suggests it is unlikely for a single-host pathogen to cause extinction of a wild species. DFTD's tendency to remain prevalent even as devil numbers dwindle poses a challenge for disease management. Nevertheless, strong multi-disciplinary collaborations have made considerable progress in understanding the aetiology of DFTD, ultimately informing conservation efforts. High-throughput sequencing technology is proving essential to conservation genomics and, in the case of the devil, the recent elaboration of the devil/DFTD transcriptome has equipped conservationists with the means to judiciously manage insurance populations. Additionally, in providing a gene-level insight into DFTD pathogenesis, this data brings us closer to preventative or curative therapy. With progressive habitat fragmentation and introduced species contributing to the tenuous future of the devil, continued efforts to mitigate the extinction of this important species are crucial.",

The Luminex xTAG open platform is well suited for the development of custom multiplex assays for syndromic surveillance and index case diagnosis. Nipah virus (NiV) is a bat-borne paramyxovirus capable of infecting humans and a range of domestic animals. NiV first emerged in 1998-9 in Malaysia and Singapore, with over 200 people infected and a case fatality rate of approximately 40%. This outbreak was characterised by transmission of infection from bats to pigs and pigs to humans, with no documented human to human transmission. A divergent NiV strain emerged in 2001 in Bangladesh and India and has since resulted in numerous outbreaks of human disease, with nearly annual occurrence and mortality rates higher than 90% in some outbreaks. In contrast to the Malaysia strain, human to human transmission of NiV Bangladesh has regularly occurred and there is no recognised host intermediate to bats and humans. Higher virulence and an increased incidence of respiratory involvement in human cases of infection with NiV Bangladesh, compared with NiV Malaysia, may facilitate human to human transmission. No in vivo or in vitro comparisons of the two viral strains have been reported to date. This study compared features of infection and viral shedding between the Malaysia and Bangladesh NiV strains in a mammalian infection model using ferrets as a human surrogate. Two groups of ferrets were infected with either NiV Malaysia or NiV Bangladesh to test the hypothesis: NiV Bangladesh is capable of human to human transmission, as characteristics of infection, tissue tropism, and shedding differ from NiV Malaysia. Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are closely related paramyxoviruses that have independently emerged in the past 15 years. Pteropid bats, the natural animal reservoir of these viruses, have not been observed to show clinical signs associated with infection, however spill-over events from these animals have led to clinical disease in several mammalian species including humans, horses, and pigs. Infection in humans can present as a rapidly progressive severe meningoencephalitis often resulting in death. Several animal models have been developed for use in studies of disease progression, transmission, preventatives and therapeutics including guinea pigs, hamsters, pigs, horses, monkeys and ferrets, but the lack of a mouse model has severely limited the opportunities for pathogenesis research.",

Thus far our results suggest that aged mice may be uniformly susceptible to infection of the central nervous system when challenged by the intranasal route. These studies may form the basis of a new animal model that can be used for investigating the mechanisms by which viremia is controlled and henipaviruses cross the blood-brain barrier resulting in encephalitis. Along with determining the basis of age susceptibility, this model offers great promise in contributing to development of improved treatment options for human cases of disease.

It was conducted from 2006 to 2009, on 1039 cows from 2 to 10 years of age. Blood sample was collected from each cow and the sera obtained were analysed to determine antibodies against N. caninum using competitive ELISA kit multi -species (VMRD Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA).The eating habits of families at risk were recorded, particularly the consumption of unpasteurized or pasteurized milk.

The milk produced in semi -intensive herds is drunk unpasteurized, while that produced in intensive farms is pasteurized. Because of the eating habits of the senegalese population including the consumption of undercooked meat and unpasteurized milk, the risk of contracting neosporosis is real. Therefore, the morphological and biological similarities between Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii require routine screening of women who have several miscarriage and of immunosuppressed patients with lesions known as ''cerebral toxoplasmosis'' diagnosed by medical imaging.

Flocks were visited every 4 weeks from the beginning of the laying period until their seroconversion or up to 6 months of lay. An epidemiological questionnaire was filled-in with the farmer and 20 ducks were randomly sampled for blood examination. Only flocks that were seronegative at the first visit were included (n = 151 flocks with natural mating or artificial insemination). Survival analysis was performed on the data. Several risk factors of introduction of AIV were identified, such as: type of production link with artificial insemination practice, presence of poultry farms in vicinity, lack of disinfection practices (of the air ante-room and of the eggs stocking room, of the ground outside the house) and disinfection of the building done by the farmer instead of an hygiene specialist. Likewise, some events increase risk of contamination of flocks such as manure spreading near the barn, presence of rodents in the house or of wild birds close to the building and introduction of vehicles in the building when litter is introduced. This is one of the rare studies, producing original data about AIV and domestic ducks, that will provide keys to increase the sanitary level of this production regarding all AIV infections.",

Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a bovine disease caused by a virus (LSDV) of the capripoxvirus genus in chordopoxvirus sub -family and poxviridae family. LSD is a transboundary disease and has high negative impact on both international trade and rural economy. In terms of spatial distribution, LSD was first confined to sub -Saharan Africa but recently it has spread to neighbouring regions such as Madagascar, Mauritius (2008 ) and Middle East (2007 , 2008 , which is an indication of its potential to occur in other disease -free parts of the world. Within the sub -Saharan Africa, LSD was mostly reported in Southern, Eastern and other countries of West Africa. According to initial data including the recent distribution map (AU -IBAR) in 2008, the Central Africa region had only reported non -georeferenced cases in Cameroon, despite the fact LSD was the most declared disease on the continent during the same period of time. This communication reports on field and laboratory investigations following a case history of a massive and severe skin disease observed in September 2009 within a N'dama Cattle ranching in the West of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In this process many species of birds were held in close proximity providing optimum conditions for disease transmission. Efforts to prevent the spread of disease were either absent or focused exclusively on Exotic Newcastle Disease. In this study, a review of the literature was made to determine the impact of the wild parrot trade on the spread of viral diseases. Nine DNA viruses and five RNA viruses were found to have disseminated globally in wild caught parrots. The impact of each virus varied widely. Some viruses caused significant disease in recently imported birds, but never became established in aviculture. Others became enzootic and continue to cause disease. The success of these viruses was the result of their ability to establish unapparent infections in some species, allowing infected birds to pass undetected into new collections and continents. The impact of these viruses on native parrots in countries where they were introduced is uncertain, but may be real. Of concern is the recent documentation of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in parrots being submitted for rehabilitation in Brazil and the detection of Avian Bornavirus and 2 genotypes of Psittacid Herpesvirus in pet parrots in Australia. In conclusion, the trade in wild caught parrots has resulted in the world-wide dissemination of an extraordinary number of viruses, with little notice by regulatory agencies.",

Whole genome DNA sequence analyses showed that SCHU P0 and P5 harbored one nucleotide deletion in both pdpC1 and pdpC2 genes. In contrast, SCHU P9 possessed intact pdpC2 gene. Indeed, intact PdpC protein was detected in only SCHU P9 by western blotting analysis. No other mutations were observed. We concluded that PdpC contributed to pathogenecity of F. tularensis SCHU.",

Prevention of Coxiella burnetii shedding in cattle is a critical point for controlling the spread of the pathogen between animals, and from animals to human.

Vaccination with a phase 1 vaccine has been shown to be effective to prevent shedding in susceptible animals, even in infected cattle herds, making pivotal to identify them prior to vaccination. Thus, the objectives of this study were to describe the distribution of within-herd apparent seroprevalence among cows and nulliparous females and to explore the association of management practices and herd characteristics with these seroprevalence.",

To ensure optimum compliance with disease control response it is important to understand what drives and inhibits such behaviours. The A/H1N1/09 ''swine flu'' pandemic has shown that public reaction to novel vaccinations, and low levels of perceived threat result in poor uptake of vaccination. Simply having a vaccine available is not enough to guarantee uptake. This presentation will compare two streams of data: one from public health, with data collected in 2007 and 2010 relating to population willingness to adopt protective health behaviours in the event of a future influenza pandemic, e.g. mask wearing and receiving vaccination, and a second from an emergency animal disease, with data collected during the 2007 equine influenza outbreak and a year later, and additional data collected in 2010 on biosecurity behaviour, e.g. hygiene and access control. Analysis of factors influencing the uptake of these behaviours identifies a range of common drivers and barriers. Lower levels of threat perception and fearfulness and low personal vulnerability, attitudes towards response effectiveness and past experience are important in current and future practices, as are a number of demographic factors.",

The exact mechanism of pathogenesis for these viruses is unknown. Henipaviruses encode several proteins from the P gene (SB, C, V and W), of which V and W have been demonstrated to antagonise the innate immune response. Viral proteins that act as interferon antagonists are important virulence factors, and their identification and characterisation should provide valuable insights into viral pathogenesis. It has been hypothesised that the pathogenicity of henipaviruses is related to the ability of the virus to circumvent the host interferon response via the combined action of the P-gene products. Due to the limitation of conducting infection experiments in a high containment laboratory, previous work by others on the henipavirus P gene products, specifically looking at innate immunity, has used transient expression of transfected single genes. This study outlines the suspected roles of these proteins during live virus infection studies conducted at Biosafety Level 4 and confirms that there are differences between the results determined by single gene transfection studies and the live virus infection studies. We will present data examining the interferon response of henipavirus infected human and bat cell lines, analysing both the interferon production and signalling pathways. Flaviviruses are arthropod-transmitted viruses that belong to the Flaviviridae family. Flaviviruses have worldwide distribution and are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, causing severe encephalitic, haemorrhagic, and febrile illnesses in humans and animals. Molecular assays such as PCR based techniques have been increasingly used for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. A real-time PCR detection system was developed for rapid detection and differentiation of members of flaviruses. The PCR uses a pair of primers targeting a region (around 270 nt, depending on different strains tested) at the N terminal end of NS5 gene. Thirteen flaviviruses belonging to different serogroups were tested by the PCR assay, including several viruses of public health importance, such as West Nile virus (New York 99) (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Kunjin virus (KUNV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE), Yellow fever virus (YFV) and Dengue virus (DENV). Following high resolution melting curve (HRM) analysis of amplified PCR products, flavivirus could be distinguished at the species (or serogroup) level. The utility of this assay was further evaluated using serum samples from pigs experimentally infected with JEV. The sensitivity of PCR-HRM assay compared well with species-specific real-time TaqMan PCR assays for detection of JEV and WNV. The method combines broad spectrum realtime PCR with product-specific identification to enable simultaneous detection and grouping of flaviviruses. It would provide an alternative to multiple type specific real-time PCR assays or conventional PCR amplification-sequencing approaches. High throughput testing can be performed.",

We recently documented an epizootic of avian beak and keratin disorder among Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus), and other non-migratory bird species in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In affected birds, the keratin layer of the beak becomes grossly overgrown, often accompanied by abnormal skin and feathers. We investigated the pathology of this disorder in order to describe underlying physiological changes and identify possible mechanisms and causative agents. Examination of keratinized tissues using histology and scanning electron and x-ray microscopy revealed evidence of a keratin maturation problem in multiple tissues. We measured beak growth rates in captivity and documented significantly faster growth in affected birds. The deformities may also be indicators of other systemic health problems, suggested by high, unexplained mortality rates and increased susceptibility to secondary infectious agents, evidenced by skin lesions of bacterial and/or fungal origin. Occurrence of this disorder across a growing geographic area with apparent epizootic clusters raises concern about underlying environmental factors, including contaminants, infectious agents, and nutrient availability. Presence of deformities in ecologically dissimilar species indicates that etiological agents of this disorder occur across a broad environmental gradient, including both terrestrial and coastal systems. Resident avian species serve as important ecological indicators; an epizootic of this scope has implications not only for bird populations, but also for wildlife and human health.",

Recent studies have documented that the active form of vitamin D [1,25(OH) D3] is a potent, pleiotropic hormone that targets 200 human genes responsible for a wide variety of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and function. The hypovitaminosis D pandemic (about 1 billion people are affected worldwide) has been linked to the pathogenesis of many degenerative, inflammatory, metabolic and malignant diseases. The limited quantity of vitamin D in food, insufficient sun exposure, wearing traditional veils and dark skin are among the main contributors of hypovitaminosis D. Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high and rising in the general population (30%-80%), particularly in older adults, children, women of child-bearing age and people of low socioeconomic status, even in sunny countries. However, the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of chronic illnesses remains uncertain. Studies and metaanalyses of effectiveness of vitamin D administration on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, cancer, falls and fracture prevention produced discrepant results. The major unresolved issues include also (1) the mechanism of action of vitamin D (role of calcium, calcium-sensing receptor, PTH, fibroblast growth factors), (2) the optimal level of serum of 25(OH) vitamin D, (3) the need of enrichment of food products, (4) the optimum dose, type of vitamin D and route of administration, (5) the need for calcium co-administration, and (6) when to check 25(OH) vitamin D level and how to adjust the dosage. Correcting hypovitaminosis D may have a significant effect on health worldwide, but further studies are required to define optimal practice.",

Whilst theoretically appropriate, the dissemination of MRSA ST-398 in animals and food products in countries outwith the UK and minimal dedicated surveillance for MRSA in farm animals is an indication to explore further the potential hazard of MRSA in meat products to which dogs may be exposed. This pilot study aimed to identify if and at what prevalence Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA were present in meat samples and dried pig ear treats. Meat (n = 100) and dried pig ear (n = 50) samples were obtained from butchers, supermarkets and pet shops in a defined geographical region in the UK.

The recovery of NTM surviving the cooking process warrants further investigation. Australia's beef food safety policy changed on 1 March 2010 allowing BSE positive countries to apply for access to the Australia beef market. The new policy is a result of scientific evidence indicating that the BSE epidemic in cattle peaked in 1992 and that measures to reduce the risk of exposure to the BSE agent through the food chain can be effective. Under the new policy, risk assessment and country categorisation will be conducted by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to ensure that beef and beef products from a country will not pose a risk to the health of Australian consumers. The key objectives addressed by FSANZ were to: (1) develop an evidence-based risk assessment process that is comparable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) methodology but incorporates criteria around traceability and identification; (2) develop methods for in-country inspections to verify country BSE control measures; and (3) set up effective collaboration between FSANZ and Biosecurity Australia (BA) who, in a parallel process, conduct Import Risk Analyses to assess animal biosecurity concerns. In meeting these objectives, effort has focussed on ensuring that an appropriate methodology which is consistent with scientific data on BSE risk factors and considers the interests of key stakeholders was developed. Several countries have submitted applications for BSE food safety risk assessment and assessment protocols and criteria, according to objectives described above, have been established and applied to the information provided by the applicant countries to determine their BSE risk status.",

The majority of newly graduated physicians were recruited to work in health centers and people were asked to refer to health centers not to be wandered in the corridors of the hospitals. The outcome was a predictable confusion for the patients and the physicians. The physicians thought about the money and the salary they earned in the early ages of post graduation and the people were relieved to refer to physicians in no time. The problem of drug and surgeries became critical for government in general and the people, in particular. The language and cultural interactions reduced the extent rapport between both groups.

Nurses represent the largest group of public health workers worldwide and often are the only human health professionals in rural communities of less developed countries where emerging disease threats are highest. In many countries, nursing is not yet a major partner in the planning and development of One Health frameworks and strategies. This presentation provides theoretical and practical information from nursing (both art and science) that will strengthen the interdisciplinary thinking, cross training, and collaboration needed to adequately prepare for and respond to emerging infectious diseases. Nursing is by tradition and academic foundations a holistic discipline, incorporating systems theory, complexity theory, social change theory, and social network theory into practice at the individual, community, and policy levels. In the most remote communities in the world nurses practice in villages ''where the forest meets the farm'' and are often the first observers of and responders to emerging infections in animals and humans. Thus nursing is well prepared to lead interdisciplinary teams to improve response capacity for emerging infections. The University of Minnesota School of Nursing (USA) is engaged in bi-directional learning partnerships with East and Central African universities within the context of a One Health initiative that includes nursing, veterinary medicine, medicine, public health, agriculture, wildlife ecology, and education.

A risk can be rated as unacceptable, severe, medium, low or negligible. Newly developed biological material such as live vaccines must pass different application levels before first use: contained application under laboratory conditions, field application, and commercial application. This can be seen as a stepwise approach in risk assessment during the development process. In recent decades, not only risk communication and the pharmacovigilance network have been improved globally but the different national animal disease control programmes are increasingly being respected.

The six countries include Cambodia, Yunnan and Guanxi Provinces of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by each country's Minister of Health formalized this collaboration in 2001. A new MOU was signed in May 2007, reinforcing the MBDS partnership. MBDS facilitates new and stronger relationships to influence the way health officials in the region interact with each other. MBDS helped establish a working relationship between WHO country offices in Asia. The MBDS Network demonstrates systems that facilitate compliance with the International Health Regulations through development and testing of guidelines and protocols with multiple sectors at border sites. Data from routine surveillance on priority diseases in each site are exchanged through the national coordinators and the adjacent province's site coordinator. Reports of suspected outbreaks are also conveyed as appropriate. Information exchanges are carried out daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly across border provinces. Cross-border teams made up of health, customs, immigration, and border officials established in 2006 facilitate several activities including dengue fever investigation between Laos and Thailand; typhoid investigation between Laos and Vietnam provincial sites; avian influenza investigation of cases in humans, triggered by the discovery of an infected Laos citizen in Thailand. The joint Thai-U.S. CDC Field Epidemiology Training Program, Mahidol University, and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization -TropMed programs coordinate annual training for MBDS participants. Members of MBDS are working to create and maintain existing field epidemiology capacity via a new Southeast Asia network -called The International Group for Epidemiology and Response (TIGER). The network produces graduates and tracks capacity building of field epidemiology training program (FETP), FE(lab)TP, FE(vet)TP, with particular attention to the increasing formal and informal scientific communication among MBDS countries and mentoring countries.Communication between the lists of ProMED-mail and ProMED-MBDS will permit the reporting of important outbreaks that are occurring in the region and allowing for an early notification of outbreaks within the region (http://www.ghsi.org/projects/mbds.html).",

The anaphylaxis to red meat/s was usually delayed by several hours and commenced within approximately six months of the allergic tick bite/s. The authors concluded that the majority of cases of the rarely occurring condition of mammalian meat allergy are preceded by sensitisation to tick bites (p < 0.001). These patients were all residents of the peninsula region of Sydney, an area endemically infested with a number of tick species, however, the tick which is usually involved in allergic reactions in humans appears to be Ixodes holocyclus. Reports of this complaint along the length of the eastern seaboard prompted us to identify potential ecological drivers promoting this association.Candidate ecological drivers:1. Increasing tick numbers:Ixodes holocyclus is widely distributed along the entire eastern seaboard of the Australian continent (Storer et al. 2005 ) and the natural host for Ixodes holocyclus is the bandicoot. Global warming may conceivably expand the length of the tick breeding cycle or increase habitat.",

The success of the tick's ability to induce Th2 responses;The more increasing the population, the more requirements of protein content foods is needed. The residues of different drugs in meat and milk, not only brings pharmaceutical resistance, but it may cause cancer, poisoning, intense allergies, gastrointestinal infections, hepatic, hormonal, audition and vision damages. As a result, a general understanding of different drugs and their critical times is really necessary for all authorities and who are involved in animal and public health activities.Different categories of drugs have different periods to excrete from the bodies of domestic animals and poultry that are known as the forbidding time or slaughter avoidance. Important examples are: from antibiotics group Oxytetracycline remains 18 days in red meat, 120 hours in milk and 1-5 days in poultry meat; Enrofloxacin 7 days in red meat,168 hours in milk and 9-18 days in poultry meat and Sultrim 7 days in red meat, 120 hours in milk, and 5-10 days in poultry meat. From the category of antiparasite, Rafoxanide remains 28 days in red meat and 12 hours in milk. Oxytocin (from hormonal drugs) remains 3 days in red meat and 120 hours in milk; and Trichlorophen (Neguvon) (from poisons) remains 7 days in red meat. Diuretic drugs such as Furosemide remain 2 days in red meat, 48 hours in milk and 35 days in poultry meat. Tranquilizer/sedative drugs such as Rampon (xylazine) remain 3 days in red meat and 72 hours in milk. In this article the time required excreting the different categories of drugs will be separately discussed. According to the high level of Sarcocystosis, related economical losses due to condemnation of slaughtered ruminants and the wide distribution, more stringent monitoring and surveillance should be adopted in such conditions.",

This study used computer-assisted telephone interview method (CATI system). Among them, 669 parents completed the survey. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, and multiple regressions.The findings showed that only 14.9% knew the health promoting school program policy. Although 91.3% parents agreed to attend in HPS programs, 74.4% parents had no free time to involve in each HPS activities. According to multiple regression analysis, It was found that parents' self-efficacy and subjective norms significantly predicted parents' participated HPS program intention. (Adjusted R2 = 0.269) According to the research results, most of parents lacked of cognition about the HPS policy and efficacy of attending HPS program. For increasing the family participated intention on HPS program, We suggest that HPS programs should enhance parents' self-efficacy and normative belief through school health policy. The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccination rate was the highest (82.9%) among Taiwan's health care workers (HCWs) in OECD countries. Taiwan CDC conducted the study to explore the HCWs behaviors and opinions during H1N1 pandemic in 2009.To explore H1N1 vaccination perception and behaviors among HCWs. A total of 1123 HCWs included physicians, nurses, and pharmacists were interviewed by using structure questionnaires on telephone from October 23-27. The interviewed hospital units included internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. Chi-square test was used in the analysis.The correct recognition of H1N1 was higher (>80%) in HCWs than general population. The health information was mainly from hospital/clinic, and followings mass media and government health education promotion. The CDC's publication for HCWs had significant effects. The acceptance rate of H1N1 vaccination among HCWs was 72.3% and doctors were the highest. High acceptance rate also implied high vaccination rate. The willingness for H1N1 vaccination was significantly associated with occupation (p < .001), gender (P < .001) and age (P < .05). 12.1% HCWs would not receive H1N1The aim of this study was to analyze the policies regarding pandemic avian influenza control in three Southeast Asia countries, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two aspects of policy formulation were explored; poultry vaccination and antiviral stockpiling with Oseltamivir for human. This paper explores, through a comparative analysis of policy formulation, why different approaches were adopted in some countries from others in one policy arena.It was found that while Indonesia and Vietnam introduced poultry vaccination programs, Thailand rejected this policy approach. By contrast, all three countries adopted similar strategic policies for antiviral stockpiling. Given the highly pathogenic avian influenza, economic imperatives are of critical importance. While Thailand's poultry economy is large and primarily an export economy, Vietnam and Indonesia's are domestic. The introduction of a poultry vaccination policy in Thailand would have threatened its potential to trade and thus, had a major impact on its economy. Powerful domestic stakeholders in Vietnam and Indonesia, by contrast, were concerned more about maintaining a healthy domestic poultry population. Evidence on vaccination was drawn upon differently depending upon strategic economic positioning.With influenza A H5N1 endemic in some countries of the region, these policy differences raise questions around regional coherence of policies and the pursuit of an agreed overarching goal, be that eradication or mitigation. Moreover, while economic imperatives have been critically important in guiding policy formulation in the agriculture sector, questions arise regarding whether agriculture policy is coherent with public health policy across the region.",

A total of 8191 healthy adults with different professional fields (5253 males and 2959 females) voluntarily admitted to annual physical check-up between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. Blood samples and ultrasound-proved fatty liver sonography results were collected.The prevalence of NAFLD for this study population was found to be 49.1%, the prevalence revealing a statistically significant decrease with increasing population age (p < 0.001). Males exhibited a greater prevalence of NAFLD than did females (57.7% vs 33.9%, p < 0.0001). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, in addition to male gender (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.17-1.50), an older age (OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.03-1.05), higher BMI (OR = 4.79, OR = 15.51, , higher GPT(OR = 3.21, 95%CI: 2.59-3.97), computer and mathematical occupations (OR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.20-1.74), architecture and engineering occupations (OR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.29-1.72), presence of hypertension",
