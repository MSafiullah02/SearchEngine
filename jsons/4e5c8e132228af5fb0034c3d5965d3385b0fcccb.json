Since the first descriptions of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the tonsils and in the nasopharynx put forth by Schmincke [63] , Regaud and Reverchon [60] , and Reverchon and Coutard [61] , the transitional cell carcinoma, defined for the first time by Quick and Cutler [56] , as well as anaplastic carcinoma or indifferent cell carcinoma have been classified separately from keratinizing or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx [13, 17, 18, 64] . Yeh [72] , after having evaluated 1000 biopsies, rejected the definition of lymphoepithelioma as a separate entity and classified them as transitional cell carcinomata which infiltrate local lymphatic tissue. In concurrence with Wang et al. [70] , Yeh could see no better healing process or prognosis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lymphoepithelial differentiation. In contrast to these observations, von Ilberg et al. [41] ascertained that different clinical processes and a better prognosis exist for lymphoepithelial carcinomata than for other nasopharyngeal carcinomata. Chiang and Jung [14] , who classified 159 cases as squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma (lymphoepithelial type carcinomata were included in this category), or anaplastic carcinoma, saw no correlation between histological type and tumor spread.",

Four of the examined tumors presented the typical picture of a Iymphoepithelioma of the Regaud type with development under the epipharynx epithelium, tendency to spread downwards into the adjacent connective tissue and a relatively sharp definition between the epithelial part of the tumor and lymphatic tissue (Fig. 1 a) . The tumor cells were arranged in the form of wide bands with pointed extensions. They were often bordered by a row of narrow connective tissue cells, not however by a distinct basal membrane. Within the cell bands the atypical squamous epithelium was characterized by the following: cytoplasm of varying extent with occasional marked lightening of the cytoplasmic ground substance, polymorphous, chromatin dense nuclei, as well as some large and bubble-like nuclei and the presence of one or two large dark nucleoii (Fig. i a, b) . Cel3s with two nuclei or with a single huge nucleus also occured. Mitosis with partly atypical figures were frequent ( Fig. 1 a) . Only single lymphocytes and immunocytes could be recognized directly between the epithelial tumor cells. The lymphatic tissue beside the epithelial bands consisted for the most part of immunocytes ( Fig. 1 a) . Only in one case, an epithelium type having spindly extensions had developed in places ( Fig. 1 b) .",

In the case of the lymphoepithelial carcinoma, the tumor cells showed varying features; besides interlocking structures of tumor cells wider interstitial gaps with a basal membrane like substance and collagenous fibrils were observed. The immunocytes with their marked ergastoplasm frequently lay cap-like against the epithelial elements. The occasionally enlarged ergastoplasm of the tumor cells contains isolated myelin figures, doublings of the membranes also appeared. Coil-like, intertwinned, fine filamentary cytoplasmic inclusions could not be interpreted. In mitotic figures, even during the telophase, extended spindle forms with extraordinary long tubules could be observed. Those particle inclusions which could be easily distinguished from multivesicular bodies will be reserved for the second part of the discussion. In the low differentiated squamous cell carcinoma there also appeared many short bundles of tonofilaments and occasional keratohyalin The carriers of the five carcinomata examined electron microscopically showed an increased antibody titer against the Epstein-Barr virus, which is regarded as significant for the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although such titer increases have also been determined in Burkitt lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis and leukemia. Schmauz et al. [65] saw themselves in a position to estimate the therapeutic success for nasopharyngeal carcinoma by considering the different titer levels. This control possibility appears all the more significant due to the fact that is difficult to detect the spreading of these carcinomata by clinical-morphological methods as they frequently show primary invasive growth and no ulceration of the surface mucous epithelium.",

            "text": "The morphological findings which pathogenetically link up an EBV infection with human tumors are based on the evidence of particles similar to herpes virus, Duff [57] , the infection with the oncogenous virus brings about a malignant transformation of the normal cell, with incorporation of the viral genom into the cellular DNA, whereby a neoplasm without viral replication is induced. An increased serum antibody titer against Epstein-Barr virus is one of the \"fingerprints\" of the virus contact. A viral capsid protein is suspected as antigen [33, 36] . However, the fact that sufficient capsid protein is subsequently produced to maintain the serum antibody level or cause it to increase, is not explained by this theory. But, apart from this, there exist examples of neoplastic diseases in animals as well as in humans triggered by DNA viruses in where viral particles, including those of the herpes type have been found in tissue [2, 5, 12, 20, 24] . Nadol [52] explained the lack of morphological virus evidence in tissue from nasopharyngeal carcinoma by stating that the concentration of viral particles in tumor tissue is so minimal that they cannot be detected by electron microscopy. Moreover it is possible that the sensitive DNA viruses could lose their morphological visible- [20, 44, 47] . Thus it would be understandable that virus particles were found in transformed lymphocytes of tissue cultures from Burkitt lymphoma and from nasopharyngeal carcinoma [15, 22] as it is assumed that the propagation of virus particles is promoted within the tissue culture [36] . Arnold et al. [5] were also of the opinion that DNA viruses could be detected morphologically especially when the viral DNA either accidentely or because of cellular death is ejected again from the cellular DNA.",

On a differential diagnostic basis, perichromatin granules can definitely be eliminated because of the constant size of the particles we described and because of their differentiated structure. Hypertrophied ribonucleoprotein granules can also be easily distinguished from the particles. However, the morphological distinction from nuclear pores with their many shapes especially within mitotic figures and pathological mitoses can present difficulties. Numerous reports about the pores of interphase nuclei have been available [1, 21, 25, 28, 50, 66] , but no pertinent investigation results were available to us concerning the size of nuclear pores in the prophase of mitoses and above all within pathological nuclear dividing figures such as appear in the tumors. Even the data about pore diameters vary considerably according to the animal species or tissue type examined before [--26, 28, 29, 48, 49] . With regard to the number of nuclear pores, perhaps comparisons can be drawn to the nuclei of HeLa-cetls, in which [,11, 24] nuclear pores per g2 were counted [49] . The number of particles in the nuclei of tumor cells of the examined neoplasms is 40~45 per ~t 2. Occasionally, pores with a diameter of 85-90 nm are found in the nuclear sections. With the exception of some passing ribosomal groups no central dense area could be detected within the pore lumen. Therefore tangential sections of such pores would essentially have to produce the picture of a double ringed figure, whose diameter should measure approximately 90 nm. The thin membrane, which spans the pore opening can not simulate the picture of a central core in tangential cut. Moreover, it must be noted that in tangential sections of nuclei with the usual thickness of approximately 60 nm only unsharply defined chromatin substance will be displayed, as too little of the nuclear membrane material is struck as the rays pass through to allow a sharp depiction of a membrane structure. Thus, one arrives at the picture of a \"membraneless\" nuclear section (Vogell, personal communication). This means that in the case of tangential sections of nuclear pores the pores can also appear as unsharply defined openings on the edge of the nuclear chromatin. Based on these reconstruction considerations of sections, it is our opinion that a distinction can be made between nuclear pores and the virus like particles which we have presented. In this connection it must once again be pointed out that the particles in some nuclei were so diffusely distributed over the nucleoplasm, that considering the constant particle size, the discussion about pores of the nuclear membrane can be abandoned.",

In this regard, many authors have already pointed out the importance of individual immunological defects, racial and constitutional factors. From a morphological point of view we would like to pursue speculatively a thought expressed by Zur Hausen [76] about this question. Zur Hausen considered it possible that facultatively oncogenous viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus can enter into cells through infection of these cells with another virus by means of a carrier mechanism. Structures which we have detected in the same tumor cells offer support for such a pathogenetic consideration. Some of these structures were classified as Corona viruses, others resembled structures of the Oncorna viruses. Finally, it must be pointed out again that other cytoplasmic nuclear inclusions indicate a participation of viruses in the transformed cells: namely a multiplication of ribosomes [62] , a distribution of the chromatin on the edges of the nucleus [53] , intracytoplasmic tubulo-reticular inclusions [3, 8] , and the appearance of spherical \"nuclear bodies\" [11] . We interpret our findings as substantiation for the thesis that viruses have a pathogenetic and probably even an etiologic significance in the formation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
