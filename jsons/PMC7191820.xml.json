They mentioned that hypoxia or toxins could destroy ATP since phosphorylation chain accelerates causing in accumulation of pyruvate and increased in Lactate level [13]. However, in a study on carbon monoxide-poisoned patients, although it was shown that serum lactate increases at the beginning of CO poisoning and this increase is compatible with patients\u2019 blood CO level and severity of neurologic symptoms, there was no statistically significant difference in neurological symptoms in study groups. This study concluded that serum lactate was not a beneficial criterion for intoxication determining (Spearman\u2019s test r = 0.3) [14] that is not in line with our study. Mozaffari et al. also mentioned that serum lactate was higher in patients who had died in toxicology ICU although their main focus was on ventilator-associated pneumonia and no direct correlation had been checked [15].",

It seems that Lactate and CK can be used in determination of prognosis in acute poisonings as Manini and colleagues had previously claimed [8].",
