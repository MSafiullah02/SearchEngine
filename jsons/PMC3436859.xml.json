            "text": "Bats make up approximately 20% of the extant mammalian diversity and are the second most species rich mammalian lineage after rodents [1]. The order Chiroptera is divided into two suborders: the Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera. These two lineages are estimated to have diverged approximately 58 million years ago [2]. Megachiroptera consists of a single family, the old world fruit bats, while Microchiroptera includes 17 families of echolocating bats. Bats have a wide geographic distribution and exploit a variety of environmental niches, being absent only from the polar regions. Bats are also hosts to numerous viruses, many of which are highly pathogenic to humans and other mammals yet appear to cause no clinical consequences in bats [3-8]. This group of mammals also shares a variety of unique characteristics that likely facilitate the persistence and spread of the viruses they carry. Highly social species, bats live at much higher densities than other mammals. They are the only mammals capable of powered flight and have long lifespans relative to their body size [9]. Despite their diversity, unique characteristics and role as natural reservoirs for viruses, bats are also the least studied of all mammalian taxa and there is little information available on antiviral immunity in any bat species.",

            "text": "Bats are the natural reservoir hosts of more than 80 viruses, with new viruses or viral sequences of bat origin being discovered each year [9,10]. RNA viruses account for the overwhelming majority of known bat viruses, many of which are among the most deadly known to man, including Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and SARS-like coronaviruses [9]. Many of these viruses, which cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans and other mammals, appear to cause no clinical diseases in bats under natural or experimental infection. The most studied example is the henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses) which are members of the family Paramyxoviridae. Nipah virus has a mortality rate of 40-90% in humans and close to 100% in experimental animal models (cats and hamsters). Yet, infection of Pteropus vampyrus (the natural reservoir host of Nipah virus in Malaysia) and P. poliocephalus (a related bat species native in Australia) by a high dose of Nipah virus, failed to result in clinical signs of disease [7,8,11]. Other examples of experimental infections of bats including Ebola Zaire, Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses have not resulted in any symptoms of disease despite the presence of viral RNA in tissues [3-6]. Experimental infections of P. poliocephalus with Nipah virus have demonstrated the presence of serum antibody and viral shedding in the absence of clinical symptoms of disease [11]. The only viruses that have been demonstrated to cause clinical symptoms of disease in bats are rabies virus and the closely related Australian bat lyssavirus [12,13]. However, results of experimental infections are inconsistent with only a small proportion of bats succumbing to infection, and rates of sero-conversion and virus recovery from tissues were reported to be very low [13]. The long co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has likely resulted in the adaptation of the bats immune system to cope with viral infection. One hypothesis is that the innate immune system rapidly controls viral replication to very low levels that cause no clinical consequences to bats, but still results in viral shedding and subsequent spillover to other species. However, as little information currently exists on any aspect of bat immunology and few bat-specific reagents exist, this hypothesis remains untested.",

Bats were among the organisms sequenced as part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Mammalian Genome Project. These genomic resources are an important step forward in identifying the genes that are involved in antiviral immunity in bats and in providing insights into other unique life history characteristics. There are currently two publicly available bat genome sequences: one from the megabat P. vampyrus and a second from the microbat Myotis lucifugus. Both bat genomes were initially sequenced to low coverage (2.6X for P. vampyrus and 1.7X for M. lucifugus, though a draft quality assembly of the M. lucifugus genome based on 7X coverage sequencing is now available). Additionally, the annotations were predominantly based upon comparative data. Despite these shortcomings, these projects have an important role to play in revealing the mechanisms that have evolved to allow bats to remain asymptomatic to so many viral diseases.",

P. alecto belongs to the family Pteropodidae and is closely related to P. vampyrus[14]. These two species are reservoirs for a variety of closely related viruses, the most important of which include the henipaviruses, Hendra virus in P. alecto and Nipah virus in P. vampyrus[10]. A number of important resources have now been developed for P. alecto, including cell lines from a variety of tissues [15]. We have also begun to identify some of the genes involved in immune responses in this species and carry out functional studies in bat cells [16-21]. To begin to characterise the immune gene repertoire of P. alecto, we sequenced the transcriptome of bat immune tissues and mitogen-stimulated cells using the Illumina platform. To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the transcriptome of any species of bat. Our analysis of the P. alecto transcriptome provides information on a variety of immune genes not previously identified in any bat species and represents an important starting point for examining the antiviral activity of these molecules.",

The first was obtained using total RNA extracted from a juvenile male flying fox thymus. Due to its role in central tolerance, the thymus expresses a large proportion of the proteome and therefore allows for the identification of a broad range of genes, including those involved in the immune response. To enrich for sequences corresponding to cytokines and innate immune genes, the second dataset was derived from pooled total RNA obtained from mitogen-stimulated spleen, white blood cells and lymph node and unstimulated thymus and bone marrow obtained from one pregnant female and one adult male flying fox. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Ionomycin, which stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; PolyIC, a TLR3 ligand; PHA, which triggers T cell activation and PMA, which activates T and B cells.",

Conflicting results have been reported using complete mitochondrial genome sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships with support for a sister relationship between Chiroptera and Fereungulata (Carnivora, Pholidota, Perissodactyla and Cetartiodactyla) or a relationship between Chiroptera and Eulipotyphla [28-30]. Analysis of the nuclear gene, protamine P1, as well as large genomic datasets, has provided evidence that bats are sister to a clade containing Perissodactyla, Carnivora, and Cetartiodactyla [31,32]. The volume of sequence data generated by transcriptome sequencing provides the opportunity for larger scale sequence comparisons than previously possible using the few full length bat genes available or by comparison with the limited whole genome sequence data. Our results support the comparative analysis of retroposon loci which has also demonstrated that bats share a sister relationship with horses, forming a clade with Carnivora [27].",

Of eleven previously identified P. alecto TLR genes [18], only TLR5 was absent from the oases assemblies, however it was present in the MIRA assembly, which used a lower coverage cut-off and is useful for identifying genes with low expression levels.

The only NLRs identified in the bat transcriptome datasets were NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5) and NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). NLRC5 is a recently identified NLR proposed to function as a positive and negative regulator of antiviral immune responses [36]. NLRP3 (also known as NALP3) is activated by a variety of danger signals including viral and bacterial infections and environmental irritants. Activation of NLRP3 in turn activates caspase-1 in the inflammasome which proteolytically cleaves the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into active mature peptides [37]. The identification two NLRs with associations with antiviral immunity in the bat transcriptome is remarkable and provides a starting point for understanding the role of NLRs in antiviral immunity in bats.",

Type I (including IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2) and III (IFN\u03bb) IFNs are induced directly in response to viral infection and play a role in the earliest stages of the innate immune response. Type I (\u03b1) IFN and its receptor (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) were identified in the bat transcriptome datasets (Additional file 3). Although type III IFNs, IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb2 are up-regulated in stimulated bat cells [21], neither of these genes were identified in our datasets, likely reflecting a low expression level in our samples. The IL-10R2 chain of the type III IFN receptor was present in the bat transcriptome, but its partner chain IFNLR1 was not found.

The Mx family of GTPases trap essential viral components, and in so doing prevent viral replication at early time points. Although the full spectrum of Mx antiviral activity is unknown, representatives of both RNA and DNA viruses have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of Mx [40]. A full length transcript, encoding a 667 amino acid protein was identified in our bat transcriptome datasets and found to be orthologous to Mx1 based on comparison with known mammalian Mx1 and Mx2 family members (Figure 4a and data not shown). Bat Mx1 contained the highly conserved tripartite GTP-binding domain found in all mammalian Mx proteins. In addition, a dynamin family signature and putative leucine zipper motif were found near the C terminal end, represented by a stretch of evenly spaced leucine residues. The bat protein was also conserved in the region identified as the stalk of human MxA including Loop 2 which is associated with antiviral activity. Consistent with other species, Loop 4 of the MxA stalk is the least conserved region of the bat Mx protein [41]. Loop 4 has been reported to be proteinase K sensitive and may play a role in lipid binding [42,43] (Figure 4b). Bat Mx1 does not contain the stretch of basic amino acids (K/R) near the C terminal end associated with nuclear localisation of mouse Mx1, consistent with the bat protein remaining localised within the cytoplasm [44]. The conservation of key residues important in antiviral activity is consistent with the bat Mx1 playing a role in antiviral immunity similar to other species. The identification of the sequences of important ISGs will now allow us to determine whether functional differences in the initiation and regulation of these proteins account for the differences in susceptibility of bats to viral infections compared to other mammals.",

Two families of NK receptors that bind classical MHC class I ligands have been identified: the killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIRs), which are encoded by genes in the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC), and the killer cell lectin like receptors (KLRs), which are encoded by genes in the natural killer complex (NKC). Different lineages of mammals make use of genes from the two different superfamilies to carry out analogous functions. KIRs are used preferentially by primates, cattle, domestic cats, dogs and pigs [45,46]. Similarly, the KIR-like receptors, marsupial immunoglobulin-like receptors (MAIRs) and chicken immunoglobulin-like receptors (CHIRs), have expanded in marsupials and chickens respectively [47,48]. Although CHIR-AB binds IgY, the ligand for the majority of CHIRs is unknown and the presence of a charged transmembrane residue and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), are consistent with the possibility that they play a role in NK activity [49]. Rodents, horses and platypus are the only species so far described that have expanded the KLRs, represented by the Ly49 family [50-52]. In the bat transcriptome dataset, no transcripts with homology to KIRs or Ly49 receptors were identified. In bony fish, novel immune type receptors (NITRs) which contain an N terminal variable domain and a C terminal Ig domain have been identified as the primary activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by NK cells [53]. NITRs were also used to search the bat transcriptome but failed to identify any orthologous transcripts. The failure to find KIR or Ly49 like receptors in the bat transcriptome may reflect low expression levels of these genes resulting in their absence from our datasets. However, BLAST searches of the publicly available whole genome sequence of the closely related pteropid bat, P. vampyrus revealed no evidence of KIRs or Ly49 receptors. As this is a low coverage genome (2.63X), further work is required to determine whether pteropid bats have KIR and/or Ly49 receptors. Overall, the absence of these important NK receptors from our datasets warrants further investigation into the nature of NK cells in bats.",

The CD94/NKG2A heterodimer generates inhibitory signals whereas the CD94/NKG2C heterodimer generates activating signals within NK cells. Both CD94 and NKG2A were identified in the bat transcriptome, however NKG2C transcripts were not identified, possibly reflecting the low abundance of transcripts of this gene in our datasets. Two and 37 NKG2A transcripts were identified in the thymus and pooled datasets respectively and six transcripts corresponding to CD94 were identified in the pooled dataset. Two of the longest NKG2A sequences were aligned with NKG2A and NKG2C sequences from human and mouse. As shown in Figure 5a, the bat genes display highest conservation with other NKG2A genes including the presence of conserved ITIM motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, designated by I/V/L/SxYxxL/V indicating that they are likely functional inhibitory receptors [55]. The more divergent NKG2D, which binds MHC class I chain-related genes, MICA/B, and the UL16 binding proteins (ULBPs) in human [46], was also detected.",

The absence of key cysteines in both of the bat CD94 sequences may have implications for the formation of heterodimers with NKG2 and for the unique folding of the CD94 chain. Combined with our failure to detect KIRs or Ly49 receptors, our data may provide the first evidence for the presence of atypical NK cell responses in bats.

As the sequences were obtained from multiple individuals, it is not possible to confidently distinguish between alternative isoforms, alleles and in some cases, loci. However, clustering the remaining contigs with open reading frames (ORFs), there are clearly at least 9 distinct MHC class I genes expressed. The majority of class I contigs contained the \u03b11 or \u03b12 domain or partial sequence corresponding to both domains and were used for further sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of contigs with the most complete \u03b11 or \u03b12 domains were aligned with human HLA-A (Figure 6). All of the bat class I sequences contained a unique three amino acid insertion in the \u03b11 domain that appears to be bat specific. As shown in Figure 6, the bat transcripts display amino acid variation in their \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains, corresponding to the peptide binding region. However, they appear to be remarkably conserved from residues 131 to 175 of the \u03b12 domain.

The insertion at the end of the \u03b11 domain is not present in class I sequences from other mammals and includes two in frame stop codons that would prevent translation beyond the \u03b11 domain (Figure 6). This sequence was confirmed by RACE PCR and transcripts were detected in a variety of tissues including lymph node, spleen, liver, lung, heart, kidney, small intestine, brain and salivary glands, thus providing evidence that they are not an artefact of the transcriptome assembly (data not shown). Comparison with the closely related P. vampyrus whole genome sequence available in Ensembl revealed that the 84 bp insertion is identical to the beginning of intron 2 of a P. vampyrus class I gene. MHC class I splice variants that retain intron sequence and result in the translation of a truncated protein have been identified in other mammals, including soluble splice variants of human HLA-G that plays a role in immunoregulation at the feotal-maternal interface [57]. Further investigation will be required to determine whether the bat gene encodes a soluble protein corresponding only to the \u03b11 domain or whether it represents a transcribed pseudogene.

The unannotated contigs contained a total of 3266 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp. Of these, 92.6% (E-value < 10-3) aligned to the closely related P. vampyrus whole genome sequence and represent highly divergent homologues or bat specific genes. The remaining loci represent either misassembled contigs or bat-specific transcripts that are located in sequencing gaps in the low coverage P. vampyrus genome sequence. The 3266 long (>300nt) ORFs were searched for conserved domains using profile hidden Markov models with hmmscan (HMMer v3; http://hmmer.org/) obtained from the Pfam database [69]. This identified 345 ORFs containing 214 unique domains, including several defensins, antimicrobial peptides and DNA-binding domains. Searches using domain models from the Pfam-B database, identified a further 437 unique, predicted-conserved domains in 733 ORFs. A further 2188 ORFs remained unannotated. A high proportion of these were rich in cysteine, tryptophan and proline, and prolines frequently appeared in low complexity regions (additional file 4: Figure S2a and b). Further characterisation of these unannotated transcripts will provide insight into whether they are functionally significant and in particular whether any unique bat specific transcripts are involved in the antiviral immune response.",

Despite the central importance of bats in harbouring a variety of viruses with the potential to spillover to other species, very little is known about antiviral immunity in bats. Next generation sequencing provides the opportunity to survey genes that are conserved between distantly related species as well as to provide insights into novel adaptations through the identification of previously unidentified transcripts. To identify genes involved in the immune response, we carried out a transcriptome analysis of thymus and immune cells and tissues of the Australian black flying fox, P. alecto. This study represents the first survey of expressed bat immune genes and complements existing low coverage bat genome sequences. Our analysis provides a broad overview of the bat transcriptome and contains representatives of all of the major classes of immune genes. The results are consistent with bats having all of the components of the immune system present in other mammals. The majority of these correspond to genes that have not previously been described in any species of bat and thus represent an important resource for future investigations into antiviral immunity in bats.",
