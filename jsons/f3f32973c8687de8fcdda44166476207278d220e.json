The aim of BioASQ is the promotion of systems and methods for highly precise biomedical information access. This is done through the organization of a series of challenges (shared tasks) on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering, where different teams develop systems that compete on the same demanding benchmark datasets that represent the real information needs of biomedical experts. In order to facilitate this information finding process, the BioASQ challenge introduced two complementary tasks: (a) the automated indexing of large volumes of unlabelled data, primarily scientific articles, with biomedical concepts, (b) the processing of biomedical questions and the generation of comprehensible answers. Rewarding the most competitive systems that outperform the state of the art, BioASQ manages to push the research frontier towards ensuring that the biomedical experts will have direct access to valuable knowledge.",

MEDLINE/PubMed currently comprises more than 20 million articles with more than 2 new articles published in biomedical journals every minute 1 . This wealth of new knowledge is essential for scientific progress in biomedicine and can have a high impact on public health. However, ensuring that this knowledge is used in a timely manner by the biomedical experts is necessary for maximizing the benefit of the society. BioASQ 2 is a series of international challenges (shared tasks) and workshops focusing on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. The BioASQ challenges [7] are structured into complementary tasks and sub-tasks so that participating teams can focus on tasks relevant to their area of expertise, including hierarchical text classification, machine learning, information retrieval and multidocument summarization amongst many other areas. BioASQ is also unique in requiring that the participating systems answer biomedical natural language questions by searching in both structured data (e.g. ontologies, databases) and unstructured data (e.g., biomedical articles).",

The BioASQ challenge has been running on an annual basis since 2012. The workshop has been taking place in the CLEF conference till 2015. In 2016 and 2017 it took place in ACL, in conjunction with BioNLP. In 2018 and 2019, it took place as an independent workshop in EMNLP and ECML-PKDD conferences respectively.

Both these tasks have been running since the first year of BioASQ, but this is the first year for BioASQ to extend beyond the English language, by challenging the community to semantically index biomedical content in Spanish.

In effect, this is a classification task that requires documents to be automatically classified into a hierarchy of classes. A training dataset of about 14,9 million annotated articles is already available for task 8a and testsets with newly published articles will be released weekly, before the NLM curators annotate them. The systems will assign MeSH labels to them, which will be compared against the labels assigned by the curators. Evaluation in Task 8a: As the manual annotations become gradually available, the scores of the systems are updated. In this manner, the evaluation of the systems participating in task 8a is fully automated on the side of BioASQ and thus can run on a weekly basis throughout the year. The performance of the systems taking part in task 8a is assessed with a range of different measures. Some of them are variants of standard information retrieval measures for multi-label classification problems (e.g. precision, recall, f-measure accuracy). Additionally, measures that use the MeSH hierarchy to provide a more refined estimate of the systems' performance are used. The official measures for identifying the winners of the task are micro-averaged F-measure (MiF) and the Lowest Common Ancestor F-measure (LCA-F) [2] .",

This is also a classification task that requires questions to be classified into classes from multiple hierarchies. Subsequently, in the second phase of task 8b, the participants are given some relevant documents and snippets that the experts themselves have identified (using tools developed in BioASQ [6] ), and they are required to return 'exact' answers (e.g., names of particular diseases or genes) and 'ideal' answers (a paragraph-sized summary of the most important information of the first phase per question). A training dataset of 3,243 biomedical questions is already available for participants of task 8b to train their systems and about 500 new biomedical questions, with corresponding golden annotations and answers, will be developed for the five testsets of task 8b.",

For the exact answers in phase B, different evaluation measures are used depending on the type of the question. For yes/no questions the official evaluation measure is the macro-averaged F-Measure on questions with answers yes and no. For factoid questions, where the participants are allowed to return up to five answers, the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is used. For List questions, the official measure is the mean F-Measure.
