            "text": "HA is a type I glycosylated protein, which is responsible for virus entry to host cell. Functional HA protein is a homotrimer structurally composed of a stem region and a globular head region in each monomer. The head region bearing N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, SA) binding pocket is critical for receptor attachment, and contains most antigenic determinants. The stem region undergoing conformational changes is responsible for low pH-triggered membrane fusion [10], and plays an important role in cross protection against heterosubtypic IAV infection [11]. N38 glycan at this region is critical for elicitation of cross-group antibody responses [12]. HA of diverse IAV subtypes that originated from different species presents distinct receptor-binding preference. For instance, human viruses prefer binding to SAs attached to cell-surface-associated \u03b1-2,6-linked galactose, whereas avian viruses prefer \u03b1-2,3-linked galactose [13,14,15]. Residue substitutions in the receptor-binding site (RBS) of HA is crucial in determining receptor-binding properties [16]. For instance, amino acid substitutions of S138A/G186V/T221P/Q226L within the RBS affected receptor-binding properties of avian H7N9 HA [17], while G186V was reported to be pivotal for the avian-specific strain to acquire human receptor-binding capacity [18].",

Each NA tetramer consists of four identical polypeptides, and each polypeptide contains an N-terminal, a hydrophobic membrane domain, a stalk region, and a globular head domain. NA can cleave SA from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins. While HA mediates virion-SA attachment and fusion, NA is responsible for terminal SA residues cleavage [19]. N-glycolyl and O-acetyl modification of SA could reduce binding affinities of both NA and HA [20]. In addition, NA possesses at least two calcium binding sites [21]. Gene analysis of these Ca2+ binding sites reveals that they are related to NA thermostability, further suggesting a correlation between NA thermostability and virus adaption [22]. Furthermore, NA is also the major antigenic target of the host humoral immunity, and NA-specific antibodies function in limiting virus egress via interfering with the sialidase activity have drawn wide attention for development of antiviral therapies [23,24].",

NP mediates nuclear import of the vRNP complex, the PB1 subunit has the catalytic polymerase activity, the PB2 subunit contributes to cap binding, and the PA subunit is required for cleavage of the capped oligonucleotides. The complex is required for the transcription and replication of the viral genome [26]. The structure, functions, and modulation of the IAV RNA polymerase complex were further discussed by Te Velthuis and Fordor [27]. However, the mechanism of vRNP assembly remains largely unknown and several host proteins were reported to be involved during IAV infection [28,29,30]. Recently, eleuthe roside B1 was demonstrated to be able to inhibit the vRNP in vitro [31].",

The conserved M1 bears a positively charged nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif RKLKR, which is essential for membrane binding, virus replication, nuclear export of the vRNPs, and self-polymerization [33]. M2 is a type III integral transmembrane proton channel, structurally containing three domains: an amino-terminal ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain [34]. It is essential for uncoating the vRNP complex within the endosome, the process of which is essential for viral entry [35]. Moreover, in its retrograde migration route from the membrane to the cytoplasm, M2 was shown to prevent endosome fusion with the lysosome, suggesting new roles of the protein in the host cytoplasm after infection [36].",

It is also considered as the key factor to antagonize host immune system [39], since it could inhibit activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I proteins (RIG-I), interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase of the innate immunity via blocking nuclear export of host messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [40,41,42]. The mechanism underlying is revealed by determination of crystal structure of the NS1 and nuclear RNA export factor 1-nuclear transport factor 2-related export protein 1 (NXF1-NXT1) complex that NS1 could prevent mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex via binding of NXF1-NXT1 to nucleoporins [43]. Conserved RNA secondary structures at RNA positions 82-148 and 497-564 are essential for NS1 protein expression, thus affecting viral reproduction and virus\u2013host interaction processes [44]. A detailed description of structure and function of the NS1 was reviewed by Han and his colleagues [45]. NS2, also known as NEP, contains a nuclear export signal and is responsible for chromosome region maintenance 1 (Crm1)-dependent nuclear export of RNPs in the infected cells [46,47]. Crm1 contains leucin-rich nuclear export signals (NES1 and NES2) [47,48], which are important for the NS2Crm1 interaction [46,48]. In addition, interaction of CHD3 and NES1 was identified to be important in the NS2-mediated vRNP nuclear export [49].",

On the other hand, lack of proof-reading function of viral RNA polymerase results in accumulated point mutations during successive replication of the viral genome.

Most seasonal IAV infections are minimally symptomatic, while severe infection causes damage to host immune responses, thus resulting in lung inflammation and injury [53]. The virus itself, IAV\u2013host interaction, as well as a need for next-generation IAV prevention and control strategies attract extensive attention worldwide. Understanding the virus\u2013host interaction can facilitate investigation of antiviral measures.

The virus is capable of interspecies transmission to new species. However, no interspecies transmission of the bat IAVs has been reported so far [54]. Furthermore, the high frequency of mutations and recombination increases the risk of IAV adaptation in humans. Besides three pandemic subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2), other subtypes, including H5N1, H5N6, H7N7, H7N9, N9N2, and H10N8 could cross the species barrier and cause human infections [55,56,57,58]. Several effect factors are essential in IAV host switch events, including the receptor-binding properties of HA [16], as well as cellular receptors [59,60,61,62]. Long and his colleagues summarized the role of host factors in IAVs adaption to humans, and the review is recommended here for further reading [63].",

ML is also applied in characterization of distinct host tropism protein signatures [70], and prediction of amino acid changes for interspecies transmission [71]. These studies provided measures in identification of potential high-risk strains. In addition, the nucleotides and dinucleotide compositions of viruses play important roles in prediction of viral host species [72]. Combining gene sequencing technology and ML methods, researchers applied large IAV genomic datasets to analyze species selection bias of IAV mono-/dinucleotide composition and predict human-adaptive swine or avian IAVs [73,74].

Though alveolar epithelial cell is the primary target cell for IAVs, different IAV subtypes have different patterns of viral attachment (PVA). For human IAVs, Alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as immune cells such as alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, are major target cells for an established infection [75,76]. Two seasonal IAVs and pandemic H1N1 virus, preferred to attach to ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells in the upper respiratory tract (URT), and avian IAVs, take H5N1 for instance, attached seldom to these cells [77]. In the lower respiratory tract (LRT), human IAV H1N1 and H3N2 attached to more cell types than avian IAV H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian IAV (HPAIV) strain. However, H5N1 could bind to type II pneumocytes [78]. Considering the fact that metabolism in the type II pneumocytes is quite active, infection of HPAIVs is more likely to cause severe pneumonia [78]. Other research on low pathogenic avian IAVs (LPAIVs), which generally do not cause severe pneumonia, showed that these viruses usually attach to human submucosal gland cells, thus can be cleared by the mucus [79].",

            "text": "IAV infection starts from recognition of SA by HA protein, though in vitro research claimed that these N-linked glycans were not essential for virus entry [80]. The cleavage of HA precursor protein HA0 into HA1 (containing receptor binding domain) and HA2 (containing fusion peptide) in low pH environment during HA transport is critical for virion internalization [81]. Some research showed that type II transmembrane serine protease such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4), Homo sapiens serine protease DESC1 and Homo sapiens transmembrane protease, serine 13 (MSPL) can cleave human and avian IAV HA proteins at an arginine residue [82]. In addition, for avian IAVs, HA0 of HPAIVs can be cleaved by subtilisin-like protease, while that of LPAIVs is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases [83] or thrombin [84]. Therefore, in avian IAVs, the cleavage sites are considered to be the major determinants for virus virulence [85], and RNA folding in the cleavage region could be an important factor for virulence determination [86,87].",

The acidic environment of the endosome also activates M2 ion channel, hence acidifies the viral core, resulting in entrance of vRNP complex into the host cell [34]. Replication of viral genome does not require a primer but a full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), which is essential for the newly formed vRNP complex. The viral RNA polymerases first bind to the 3\u2032 end and the 5\u2032 end of the segmented viral RNA and cRNA, respectively, then start replication with the help of the 5\u2032 cap of host pre-mRNAs via a PB1-PB2-mediated \u201ccap snatching\u201d mechanism [27,89]. The conserved segment-specific nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral genome could modulate genome expression and replication during infection [90]. In addition, dephosphorylation at a specific position of the H1N1 NS1 protein results in attenuated virus replication [91].",

To uncover host dependency factors that are necessary for IAV replication, numerous large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screens and genome-wide CRISPR/Cas 9 screen were performed [29,100,101,102,103]. For instance, SON DNA binding protein was important for IAV virion trafficking in an early infection stage and CDC-like kinase 1 facilitated AIV replication [29]. USP47 facilitated viral entry, whereas TNFSF12 (APRIL) and TNFSF12-TNFSF13 (TWEPRIL) helped with viral replication [101]. Using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, several genes of sialic acid biosynthesis and related glycosylation pathways were involved with H5N1 infection [102], and WDR7, CCDC115, and TMEM199 were essential for viral entry and regulation of V-type ATPase assembly [103]. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was applied to explore host\u2013virus interactions, revealing a correlation between defective viral genomes and virus-induced host transcriptional programs [104].

NK cells are large granular lymphocytes, making up 10% of the resident lymphocytes in the lung. After recruitment from the blood, NK cells interact with DCs and macrophages to secret various cytokines and restrict infection via lysis of the IAV-infected cells. The lysis process is mediated by interaction between NK receptors p46 (most NKp46) and IAV HA protein expressed by the infected cell [116,117]. Interestingly, liver NK cells other than lung NK cells possessed a memory phenotype to protect mice against subsequent IAV infection, though the lung NK cells are important in control of primary IAV infection [118]. However, NK cells are also shown to exacerbate IAV pathology, since depletion of NK cells led to increased resistance to high dose H1N1 infection in mice [119,120]. The contribution of NK cells to anti-IAV defense in mouse models was later shown to be strain and dose dependent. In addition, the host genetic background also played an important role [121].",

TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which may be released by cellular stress and cell death [105] and unidentified RNA structures in phagocytosed cells infected with IAVs [129]. In macrophages and dendritic cells, TLR3 interacted with TIR-domain-containing adapter, then activated the serine-threonine kinase I\u03baK\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), the process of which further led to expression of IFN-\u03b2 [130]. In addition, an over-reacting TLR3 activation promoted IAV pathogenesis, which could be reduced by a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON) functioning as a TLR3 inhibitor, resulting in restrained viral loads both in vitro and in vivo [131]. TLR7 recognizes single stranded RNA (ssRNA). In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), after activation of TLR7 during IAV infection, IRF7 or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) were activated via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) to induce type I IFNs [132]. In avian macrophages, activation of TLR7 produced pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 [133]. In addition, in mouse models, TLR7 played an important role in activation of NK cells [134]. It was also shown to be involved in development of adaptive immunity to prevent IAV infection [135,136].",

For instance, MxA GTPase from the Mx family could retain viral genome from entry to the cytoplasm via blocking the function of IAV NP. In addition, in vitro research found that avian IAVs were more sensitive to MxA than human IAVs [151,152]. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) were identified to block IAV entry via altering the cellular membrane properties to interfere with viral fusion, and amplified the activation of immune cells [153]. Guanylate-binding protein 3 (GBP3) of IFN-inducible GTPases inhibited IAV replication via binding to the viral polymerase complex [154]. Members of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family are also involved in cellular anti-IAV processes. For instance, TRIM14 could interact with IAV NP for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus restricting IAV replication in a type I IFN and NF-\u03baB independent manner [155]. TRIM22 degraded IAV NP via polyubiquitination, thus resulting in inhibition of IAV infection [156]. TRIM 25 regulated the re-localization of RIG-I and was responsible for RIG-I ubiquitination as well as RIG-I-mediated IFN production [157]. TRIM32 recognized IAV PB1 protein and reduced its polymerase activity [158]. TRIM41 targeted NP for ubiquitination and degradation in vitro [159]. For further reading on other ISGs, several reviews regarding IFN responses during IAV infection are recommended here [160,161]. A general description of activation of innate immunity and IFN signaling pathway after IAV infection is illustrated in Figure 1.",

            "text": "In order to counter IFN-stimulated antiviral proteins, IAV viral proteins apply multiple strategies. For instance, HA protein was shown to trigger ubiquitination of IFNAR to attenuate the type I IFN signaling pathway [162]. The follow-up work showed that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) functions as an interacting partner of HA protein to mediate the HA-induced IFNAR degradation [163]. NS1 is the most important IFNs antagonist protein via mechanisms including inhibition of the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, suppression of protein kinase R (PKR), phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinases (IKK) \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the NF-\u03baB pathway, interruption of the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 [39,115], and degradation of OTUB1 [138]. Phosphorylation of NS1 is crucial for its function of antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 expression, since dephosphorylation at position 73 and 83 of the protein induced a high level of IFN-\u03b2 [91]. Non-structural protein PB1-F2, identified from a+1 open reading frame (ORF) of PB1 gene segment [164], is multifunctional in deregulation of type I interferon [165,166]. It counteracted RLR-mediated activation of IFN pathway not only by targeting mitochondrial MAVS [115,165,167], but also by binding to the DEAD-box helicase DDX3 to induce proteasome-dependent degradation [166]. Furthermore, PB1-F2 interacted with mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM) to mediate formation of autophagosome, thus inducing complete mitophagy, which is critical for MAVS degradation [167]. Novel PA-X protein could also modulate innate immune responses. A review regarding the function of NS1 and PA-X proteins in antagonizing host innate immunity is recommended here [114].",

Through the activation of Ag-bearing DCs, na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th7, regulatory T cells (Treg cells), follicular helper T cells, and killer cells. Th1 and follicular helper T cells are the most abundant CD4+ T helper cells. They can secret antiviral cytokines, regulate CD8+ T cell differentiation, promote B cell activation, and maintain immunological memory [182,183]. Th17 cells induced pulmonary pathogenesis and could decrease mortality of IAV-infected mice [184,185]. In addition, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, expanding in the late stage of IAV infection with a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent manner, could efficient eliminate IAV-infected airway epithelial cells, resulting in lower viral titers [186]. New surrogate markers CD49d and CD11a were used to explore the kinetics of IAV-specific CD4 T cells responses, revealing endogenous CD4 T cell response to primary IAV infection is predominantly composed of T-bet+ cells [187].",

After activated by DCs, CD8+ T cells undergo rapid expansion, differentiation, and migration to the infected sites. In general, to establish effective primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, CD4+ T cells play an essential role, with a mouse model as an exception [188]. CTLs produce cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes (GrA and GrB) to induce apoptosis and interrupt IAV replication [189]. In addition, CTLs produce cytokines, such as TNF, FASL, and TRAIL, which recruit death receptors to induce apoptosis [190]. In addition, IL16 deficiency enhanced the Th1 and CTL responses upon IAV infection [191]. Furthermore, as CD8+ cells could last for two years in murine models, IAV-specific memory CTLs reacted specific to epitopes in conserved IAV proteins [192]. In the nasal epithelia, they could prevent the spread of the virus from the URT to the lung [193]. To establish memory CD8+ T cells, autophagy plays an important role [194], while the function of CD4+ T cells in memory CTL responses is \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d. A recent study showed that CD4+ T cells promoted IAV-specific CTL memory at the initial priming stage of viral infection [195]. Grant and her colleagues summarized and discussed the importance of CD8+ T cell immunity against IAVs [192], and this review is recommended for further reading.",

Several factors such as nitric oxide (NO), cytochrome c, and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) can activate this pathway, and the key player of this pathway is proteins in the bcl-2 family, which are activated by stress signals and then release apoptotic factors via destabilizing the mitochondrial membrane [200,201], resulting in release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Cytochrome c then binds to apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and forms a complex with pro-caspase 9 (then cleaved into caspase 9), the function of which is to cleave its effector pro-caspase 3 [202]. In addition, SMAC, localizing in the cytosol, could initiate activation of caspase 9 via blocking the activity of IAP [203]. The extrinsic pathway is regulated by extracellular ligands acting on transmembrane \u201cdeath receptors\u201d: the first apoptosis signal (FAS) receptor-FAS ligand (FASR/FASL) and the TNF-\u03b1TNF receptor 1 (TNF\u03b1/TNFR1) [199]. In the FASR/FASL model, FAS ligand binds to its receptor FASR [204], forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with pro-caspase 8, resulting in activation of caspase 8 and downstream activation of other caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) [199]. In the TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 pathway, TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) is activated after binding of TNF\u03b1 to TNFR1, leading to recruitment of FADD and receptor interacting protein (RIP) [205]. FADD then associates with pro-caspase 8 to form the DISC, resulting in activation of caspase 8 and apoptosis.",

NP protein induces host apoptosis to favor viral replication through interaction with ring finger 43 (RNF43) [208], apoptotic inhibitor 5 (API5) [209], or clusterin [111]. PB1-F2 also induced apoptosis and promoted viral replication through dysregulating mitochondrial potential [206]. Furthermore, M1 promoted apoptosis by binding to heat shock protein 70, thus activating caspase and the subsequent apoptosis [210]. In addition, NS1 expression was reported to induce apoptosis in MDCK and HeLa cells [211]. However, mutant IAV lacking the NS1 gene could induce apoptosis in cultured cells [212]. The function of NS1 in inhibiting apoptosis may be explained by its ability to inhibit type I IFN [213,214]. These data demonstrate sophisticated mechanisms of IAV in regulating host apoptosis. Furthermore, the role of these viral proteins in apoptosis suggests that these proteins may present suitable targets for anti-IAV therapies. A comprehensive review on influenza A virus-induced apoptosis discussed by Ampomah and Lim is recommended here [181]. In addition, recent in vitro research found that apoptosis was induced at early IAV infection stage, while later the cell death pathway was shifted to pyroptosis. The switch process was promoted by the type I IFN-mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway through expression of the Bcl-xL gene [215].",

Accordingly, viruses antagonize the immune system through multiple measures to establish a successful infection. Considering the high frequencies in genome mutations and recombination, vaccination is the most effective way to defend against the viruses via inducing cross-protective antibodies and/or enhancing immune responses. Several studies in vaccine development have tried to enhance host immune responses. For instance, vaccine candidate containing HA targeted to chemokine receptor (porcine MIP1\u03b1) was shown to enhance T cell responses, resulting in a strong and cross-reactive cellular immunity in vaccinated pigs [216]. Another example is an attempt to intranasally administer a polyanhydride nano vaccine (IAV-nanovax), which could promote robust lung-resident germinal center (GC) B cells with lung-localized IAV-specific antibody responses as well as lung-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [217].",
