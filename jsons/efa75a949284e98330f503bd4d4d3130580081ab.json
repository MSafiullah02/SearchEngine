In a review of recent literature, thrombocytopenia was present in 2 of 14 cases (14%) of COVID-19-positive patients undergoing neuraxial procedures with a lowest reported platelet count of 81,000 \u00d7 10 6 /L. 1 Although a \"safe\" platelet count for neuraxial anesthesia is imprecise, 2,3 it is generally accepted that a platelet count of 70,000 \u00d7 10 6 /L carries a low risk, and even lower levels can be considered for those at high risk for general anesthesia. 1 At our institution, we observed an unexpected case of severe maternal thrombocytopenia (24,000 \u00d7 10 6 /L) in a 31-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) at 29 weeks and 6 days of gestation who presented for emergent cesarean delivery. The patient initially presented to the COVID-19 testing annex outside the emergency department (ED), after experiencing a cough for 1 week and developing a fever overnight of 102\u00b0F with decreased fetal movement at home. There were no contractions, leakage of fluid, or vaginal bleeding. She was directed to the labor and delivery triage for immediate evaluation.",

A decision was made for immediate cesarean delivery. On preanesthetic evaluation, the patient reported a history of normal spontaneous vaginal delivery and bipolar disorder for which she had been on lamotrigine and gabapentin (off-label use). Prenatal laboratories from 5 months ago showed hemoglobin 13.5, hematocrit 40.2, and platelet count 212,000 \u00d7 10 6 /L. Given clinical urgency indicated by category III FHR tracing, high respiratory risk associated with general anesthesia in a gravid patient with COVID-19, as well as the need to minimize potential health care worker exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) during urgent airway instrumentation, 2 we elected to proceed with spinal anesthesia as routinely performed in most elective and emergent cesarean deliveries. 4 After intrathecal administration of 1.6 mL 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine, 0.2 mg preservative-free morphine, and 15 \u00b5g fentanyl, the obstetrical team proceeded immediately with primary low-transverse cesarean delivery, and a baby girl (1330 g) was delivered with Apgar scores 3/5/7 at 1/5/10 minutes of life. The newborn was born vertex without crying and limp. There was absence of any breathing effort despite initial measures of drying, stimulating, placing over a warm mattress, and covering with plastic protection. Positive pressure ventilation was initiated, followed by intubation with 2.5 endotracheal tube, which resulted in improvement in tone and few spontaneous respiratory efforts.",

Thrombocytopenia was present at a higher rate in patients with severe disease (57.7%) compared to nonsevere disease (31.6%). 6 Although these recent observations appear to suggest that thrombocytopenia is more prevalent in severe cases, an unexpectedly severe case of thrombocytopenia can also exist in nonsevere COVID-19 disease, as seen in our patient who had no signs of viral pneumonia on CT and required no supplemental oxygen throughout her hospitalization.",

Other etiologies of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia during pregnancy include gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, and immune thrombocytopenia. 3 Several mechanisms of COVID-19-associated thrombocytopenia can be postulated. One hypothesis is direct infection of bone marrow cells by the SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting platelet synthesis. Destruction of bone marrow progenitor cells via cytokine storm in a relatively mild case of COVID-19 in our case seems rather unlikely. Alternatively, it is possible that platelet destruction is immune mediated. Interestingly, quinine-based antimalarial medications are one of the leading causes of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP). Quinine-dependent antiplatelet antibodies might bind noncovalently to specific platelet surface antigens. Hydroxyquinoline therapy was not initiated, however, in our case. Neither lamotrigine nor gabapentin is implicated in DITP to our knowledge. Finally, thrombocytopenia might occur secondary to a concomitant thrombotic and consumptive process involving platelet aggregation and microthrombi formation, which are implicated in COVID-19.",
