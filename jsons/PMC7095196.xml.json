During the early evolution of the plaque, perivascular inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) invade the substance of the white matter and are thought to play a critical role in myelin destruction.2 This process is followed by extensive gliosis by astrocytes and aberrant attempts at remyelination with oligodendrocytes proliferating at the edges of the plaque.1 In addition, immunoglobulins are deposited within each plaque.3\n",

This function is of particular importance because CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize foreign antigen in the context of class II (HLA-DR, la) or class I (HLA-ABC) MHC gene products, respectively. The class II gene products, found primarily on macrophages and B cells, are important in presentation of antigen to T cells.

Thus, class I and II MHC-positive astrocytes might play a role in local antigen presentation to T cells.

In contrast, for non-blood-relatives living together (for example, husband and wife), the concordance for MS is not increased above chance. Studies in twins have shown greater concordance between monozygotic twins than between dizygotic twins.12, 13, 14, 15 Many monozygotic pairs, however, are discordant for MS, a strong argument that genetic influence is insufficient for the development of MS.

One theory is that these disorders may have an autoimmune basis. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model of MS has prompted investigation of the autoimmune basis of human demyelinating diseases.16 EAE can be induced by injection of central nervous system myelin or its components along with adjuvants. From the EAE model has evolved the concept that the primary target in MS may be myelin and not the oligodendrocyte.17 In addition, the disease can be transferred to naive animals with cells enriched for T lymphocytes reactive to the basic protein component of myelin.17, 18, 19 Therefore, attempts have been made to determine whether an immune response to normal myelin develops in patients with MS. To date, efforts to measure such a response in patients with MS have failed even though these responses can be detected in patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis.20\n",

For example, in JHM virus infection in mice the demyelination seems to be the result of direct cytopathic injury of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells.50 In contrast, in rats the demyelination by JHM may be a consequence of autoimmune mechanisms by which sensitized T cells recognize myelin antigens.51 In visna virus, macrophages that are persistently infected are actively involved in the demyelinating process.53 With infection by Theiler's virus, viral antigens have been detected on the inner and outer glial loops of oligodendrocytes such that an immune response seems to be directed against viral or \u201cnovel\u201d antigens on the surface of these glial cells.54, 55, 56 These experiments emphasize that viruses from different \u201cfamilies\u201d may induce primary demyelination, probably by unique mechanisms.44\n",

            "text": "The recent discovery, in Japan57 and in the Caribbean,58 that chronic progressive myelopathy may be the result of persistent infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has stimulated speculation that viruses may be implicated in MS. Koprowski and associates59 reported that serum and spinal fluid samples from patients with MS in Sweden and in Key West, Florida, contained antibodies reactive with viral protein (p24) of HTLV-I. Others have failed to detect any antibody to HTLV-I, II, or III in patients with MS.60, 61 In Japan, however, investigators62 found that 11 of 46 patients with MS reacted to purified HTLV-I proteins by Western blot analysis. The discrepancies in the results may be due to differences in sensitivity of various methods. Recently, Reddy and associates63 amplified and molecularly cloned HTLV-I sequences from DNA of lymphocytes from patients with MS. Confirmation of these results by other investigators will be necessary before a firm statement can be made about its role in pathogenesis.",

During the course of viral infections of the central nervous system, specific viruses in \u201csusceptible\u201d patients may not be cleared by the immune system. Viruses may then persist in oligodendrocytes (myelin-producing cells) and injure these cells either by direct effects or by becoming targets of immune-mediated destruction. Oligodendrocytes infected by virus may express viral antigen (V), processed viral antigen (P), or novel antigens (N) on their surfaces. Immunoglobulins secreted by B cells may be directed at viral or novel antigens and thus result in injury to oligodendrocytes by complement, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages. Processed viral antigens (peptides) may be expressed on surface of oligodendrocytes and be presented to CD4+ cells in context of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (la antigens). These CD4+ cells (class II-restricted cytotoxic T cells or \u201chelper\u201d T cells) could directly injure oligodendrocytes or help B cells. Novel virus-induced antigens may be expressed on surface of oligodendrocytes and be seen in context of class I MHC antigens by CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T cells). These CD8+ cells may injure oligodendrocytes in an effort to clear viral infection or by interacting with normal host proteins. The final consequence of these mechanisms would be injury to the oligodendrocyte. The initial pathologic process could be in the inner and outer glial loops of myelin-producing cells such that destruction of myelin would occur before visible structural damage to the oligodendrocyte (\u201cdying-back gliopathy\u201d). This process would result in primary demyelination.
