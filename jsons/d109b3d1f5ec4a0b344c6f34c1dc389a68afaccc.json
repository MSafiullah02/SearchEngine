Although more than 85% of feedlots in the United States use a vaccination protocol for viruses that contribute to the develop ment of BRD, the number of cases has not decreased (Gifford et al., 2012; APHIS, 2013) . Therefore, ef fective prevention and/or early detection strategies for BRD must be developed to reduce its incidence in cattle. Prevention and diagnosis of BRD is further aBSTRaCT: Bovine respiratory disease complex (i.e., shipping fever and bacterial bronchopneumonia) is a multifaceted respiratory illness influenced by numer ous environmental factors and microorganisms. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is just one component of BRD complex. Because BRD is moderately heritable, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of BRD through genetic selection. The objectives of this study were to determine the heritability and associative genetic rela tionships among immune system traits (i.e., cortisol, total IgG, IgG isotypes, and IL8) in cattle monitored for BRD incidence. At an average of 83 d after weaning (219 d age and mean = 221.7 kg [SD 4.34] ), crossbred Bos taurus steer calves (n = 2,869) were received at a commercial feedlot in southeastern Colorado over a 2yr period. At receiving, jugular blood samples were col lected at 212 (yr 1) and 226 d (yr 2) of age for immune trait analyses. The BRD phenotype was defined as a binomial variable (0 = no and 1 = yes) and compared with immune system traits measured at receiving (prior to illness onset). An animal identified as BRD positive exhibited \u2265 2 clinical signs (i.e., eye or nasal discharge, cough, lethargy, rapid breathing, acute interstitial pneu monia, or acute upper respiratory syndrome and/or a rectal temperature > 39.7\u00b0C). Heritability and genetic correlation estimates for categorical variable BRD, cor tisol, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IL8 were estimated from a sire model using ASREML. Heritability estimates were low to moderate for BRD (0.17 \u00b1 0.08), cortisol (0.13 \u00b1 0.05), IgG (0.15 \u00b1 0.05), IgG1 (0.11 \u00b1 0.05), IgG2 (0.24 \u00b1 0.06), and IL8 (0.30 \u00b1 0.06). A moderate negative genetic correlation was determined between BRD and cortisol (r g = \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.32).

However, when exposed to acute stressors, the immune system will react in an immunoprotective manner (SalakJohnson and McGlone, 2007; Carroll and Forsberg, 2007; Dhabhar, 2009 ). In our study, cor tisol was measured after shipping, which would con stitute an acute stressor. Therefore, this may, in part, explain why there was a negative genetic correlation between cortisol and BRD. Additionally, McGlone et al. (1993) determined that there was a moderate pheno typic correlation (r p = 0.35, P = 0.036) between natural killer cell cytotoxicity and plasma cortisol concentra tions. It is possible that cortisol secretion after an acute stressor versus a chronic stressor is a different trait from a genetic standpoint; therefore, phenotypic relation ships observed in previous research may not translate to a genetic observation. Therefore, more research must be conducted to elucidate these effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 378, "text": "(Jericho, 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 379, "end": 401, "text": "Slocombe et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 505, "end": 537, "text": "(SalakJohnson and McGlone, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 538, "end": 565, "text": "Carroll and Forsberg, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 566, "end": 579, "text": "Dhabhar, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 802, "end": 823, "text": "McGlone et al.

Immunoglobulin G2 antibod ies have also been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of cattle becoming infected with respiratory bovine coronaviruses (Lin et. al., 2000 (Lin et. al., , 2001 . As IgG1 makes up the majority of total IgG and has a differing mode of regulation compared with IgG2, it is plausible that the genetic relationship between IgG1 and IgG2 with BRD would differ. To date, genetic relationships between BRD status and total IgG or isotypes of IgG have not been reported in the literature. These results suggested that negative selection pressure for IgG and IgG1 and positive selection pressure for plasma cortisol may result in progeny less susceptible to developing BRD. This is the first description of a genetic relation ship between BRD and IL8. Interleukin 8 is a cyto kine that serves as a chemoattractant signal, recruiting neutrophils to the sight of infection (Hull et al., 2001) . Phenotypically, Caswell et al. (1998) demonstrated that IL8 expression was upregulated in lesions of pneu monic pasteurellosis in beef calves. It was concluded that IL8 is integral to the recruitment of neutrophils to establish lesions in cattle with pneumonia. In vitro, low levels of Pasteurella haemolytica, a Gramnegative bacterium associated with BRD, induced high concen trations of IL8 (Morsey et al., 1996) . Similar to previ ous phenotypic reports, there appears to be a moderate positive genetic correlation between IL8 and BRD. Therefore, genetic selection against IL8 may decrease a steer's susceptibility to developing BRD. Although a moderate genetic correlation existed between BRD and IL8, further investigation is warranted to deter mine if IL8 is useful as a predictor of BRD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 25, "end": 46, "text": "Mallard et al.

Similar ratios would be expected for cattle, but immunoglobulins 3 and 4 were not measured; therefore, specific ratios could not be determined.

Because of this relationship, strong genetic correlations were expected between total IgG and isoforms, which was confirmed given the \u22650.83 \u00b1 0.09 genetic correlation. Also, there was a strong genetic correlation between IgG1 and IgG2 (0.55 \u00b1 0.16).

Results sug gested that selection for IL8 will have little impact on total IgG or isoforms and vice versa.

Therefore, a decrease in cortisol levels should increase IL8 production, po tentially leading to increased pain and inflammation. However, because only a low genetic correlation was observed, the genetic relationship between cortisol with IL8 appeared to be minimal at best in these animals.
