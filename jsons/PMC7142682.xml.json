Due to the requirement for enhanced infection control measures, procedure time for suspected and confirmed cases is dramatically longer than usual. This workload planning requires new waiting time norms for elective and urgent procedures, careful vetting of requests, and patient assessment through hospital rounds and IR clinics. A senior duty IR is assigned every day to vet requests and optimize procedure planning based on clinical needs and operational capability. Nonurgent procedures in patients suspected of infection or patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are deferred until patients can be deisolated (21). Personal contact between clinical teams and IR teams is reduced. For example, where personal consultations for procedures and imaging interpretations were previously common, these contacts have been converted to phone consultations as far as possible. Nonurgent cases such as embolization of arteriovenous malformations and angiomyolipoma, fallopian tube recanalization, uterine fibroid, and benign prostatic hypertrophy embolization have been postponed by 1 or 2 months. Urgent cases and oncology-related treatments are given priority.",

Potentially acute situations may arise during the procedure (eg, collapse during embolization of acute bleeds requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation). It is important to anticipate these and plan dedicated protocols for various scenarios. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there is potential for aerosol generation during chest compressions; hence, the use of PAPRs is recommended.

In one of the newer hospitals, a real-time locating system (RTLS) is in place. Radiofrequency identification tags are provided to all staff and patients, which log their physical locations at all times. This requires extensive investment in infrastructure but is by far the most robust method for contact tracing. Close contacts of confirmed cases (eg, those expected to have been within 2 m of the individual for at least 30 minutes and without appropriate PPE) are placed on home quarantine for 14 days with twice daily temperature and symptom surveillance. Those with appropriate PPE at the point of contact are allowed to continue working if the hospital infection control team has assessed the risk of transmission to be small. This risk assessment is necessary because otherwise large numbers of HCW could be quarantined for exposure to an undiagnosed COVID-19 patient who subsequently tested positive for the virus.
