Characterizing the spread and distribution of such contaminants so as to minimize worker exposure to them, and to maximize the effectiveness of field procedures used in removing contaminants, has been a priority. During the anthrax outbreaks, for example, extensive environmental sampling was done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with over 100 individuals involved in taking approximately 10,000 environmental samples. Between 4% and 50% of environmental samples taken from a given site were positive, depending on location sampled [SMW03] . Thus there was a high degree of variability in sample results depending on sampling location. Further, many sites continue to undergo remediation to remove all traces of Bacillus anthracis. If optimal sampling locations could be determined where bacteria were most likely present, and if environmental sampling were done at these locations, it is possible that the cost of complete building remediation could be significantly reduced.

The equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for dispersion of the contaminant (gas, liquid droplets, or solid particles) throughout the environment are solved iteratively on a high-resolution mesh until the imbalances in the equations (the residuals) decrease to an acceptably small number (iterative convergence).

Contaminant transport experiments in buildings can validate and improve MZ modeling.

Adaptive sampling is one of a family of techniques, including kriging, that estimate a field at a spatial resolution higher than what is initially known. CFD may be useful to investigate the accuracy of such estimates, through its high-resolution rendering of fields. These may be viewed as populations, from which samples may be drawn for the adaptive sampling process whose estimates can then be compared to the population. Also, CFD shares with MZ the prediction of transport. Whereas an adaptive sampling routine might look neutrally in all directions from a local maximum to find other high values, the numerical airflow model would predict that higher values occur downwind of a source.

The predictions obtained from adaptive sampling from the CFD grid of values will be compared to CFD mean values. If the use of adaptive sampling can be demonstrated successfully, CFD will be used to generate grids for a variety of contaminant situations, on which further adaptive sampling will be carried out and compared to CFD predictions.

It is not proposed to use a CFD solution for the test room as information for the wider field of contaminants and potentially contaminated environments. Rather, the specifics of the process of arriving at the CFD solution, when validated, provide information about how that same process would perform for airflow in another occupied space. To require laboratory validation for every new situation is an unnecessary burden. The aim is to first validate CFD in a situation that is feasibly measurable, then to also apply CFD in the situation of interest not amenable to direct validation. CFD is capable of tracking particles of any reasonable aerodynamic diameter from their source to their fate on a surface. Its ability to accurately predict a tracer gas field in a test room says much about the fidelity of computed particle paths in a building. On the other hand, CFD/MZ methods may provide imperfect predictions in a real-world workplace. Perhaps by combining data and CFD/MZ values, predictions of concentrations of contaminants in unsampled units may be obtained that are better than those produced by either geostatistical methods or CFD/MZ methods by themselves. Since there is also no guarantee that the assumptions required for second-order stationarity and ergodicity (which ensure convergence of the average of the sample values to the mean for large samples) will be met, it may be that alternative modeling approaches including transformation of data or considerations of lognormality may be needed.

To the extent that the modeled CFD/MZ data explain all variation, the additional contribution from the rows and columns might be unnecessary. Another plus of this approach would be that it does not seem to require stationary data. If the explanatory components from the model adjust for all changes in the mean, then the residuals will be stationary [Cre93] . Variograms can be fit to the residuals and these can be combined with the mean structure (from the model for the fitted mean) to obtain the full model for prediction of unsampled locations, in order to determine sampling locations for the second phase of sampling.

However, for other locations, where the presence of the substance is less likely, the need for probability sampling is greater. The question is how to sample and how many samples to take, to accurately assess the risk to workers. Epidemiological information such as where an index case spent time can be helpful, but limiting sampling to a specific area is often hard to justify, due to the variety of pathways for contaminant transport.

Modeling of the contaminant concentration field using a deterministic approach such as CFD or a probabilistic spatial analysis approach could help to determine appropriate sampling locations on the grid.
