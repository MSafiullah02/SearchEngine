The application of plant virus vectors is of potential interest to the worldwide, multibillion dollar, grape and wine industries. These applications include grapevine functional genomics, pathogen control, and production of beneficial proteins such as vaccines and enzymes. However, grapevine virus biology exerts certain limitations on the utility of the virus-derived gene expression and RNA interference vectors. As is typical for viruses infecting woody plants, several grapevine viruses exhibit prolonged infection cycles and relatively low overall accumulation levels, mainly because of their phloem-specific pattern of systemic infection. Here we consider the biotechnology potential of grapevine virus vectors with a special emphasis on members of the families Closteroviridae and Betaflexiviridae.",

A main promise of viral vectors is their abilities to replicate and to produce high levels of virus-derived mRNAs and proteins with no need for stable plant transformation resulting in genetically modified plants. These abilities are particularly strong in positive-strand RNA viruses that directly replicate mRNAs using their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RdRp recognition signals present in viral RNAs. In contrast, plant hosts, similar to all other cellular organisms, do not replicate their mRNAs, but rather transcribe them from their DNA genomes. The only known RNAs replicated by plants are small interfering RNAs or siRNAs that are derived from double-stranded RNA produced by the host RdRp that is nonhomologous to viral RdRps (Shabalina and Koonin 2008) .",

The TMV vector is characterized by a fast infection cycle and extremely high levels of virus-encoded protein accumulation in infected cells and plants. The major drawback of this vector is a relatively low genetic stability that results in a rapid loss of the inserted foreign genes. To mitigate this drawback, streamlined/deconstructed TMV vectors delivered by agroinoculation were designed (Gleba et al. 2014) . By avoiding genetic bottlenecks of the virus systemic transport that favor deletion of foreign inserts, massive direct agro-infection of whole plants has deflected the virus infection cycle toward rapid protein production. By deleting the TMV capsid protein gene required for systemic infection, the host cell resources were redirected to mass production of the recombinant protein, thus elevating the yield to 80% of the total soluble protein in leaf tissue or 5 g per kg of the \"wet\" leaf biomass (Gleba et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "The RNA interference (RNAi) machinery is one of the molecular signatures of eukaryotes that has likely emerged as an antiviral host defense response and has subsequently diversified to fulfill a multitude of additional functions (Shabalina and Koonin 2008) . Unlike animals, plants do still rely on RNAi as a major way to withstand viral infections. In a counter-defense response, a variety of diverse RNAi suppressors have evolved in plant viruses (Csorba et al. 2015) . As a result, modulation of virus infection process by the interplay between plant RNAi and viral suppressors results in a spectrum of virus infection cycle scenarios ranging from host immunity to extreme susceptibility, depending on specific virus-host combinations and environmental conditions. One of the rather counter-intuitive outcomes of such interplay is virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), a process whereby insertion of a recombinant nucleic acid fragment into virus genome triggers RNAi-mediated degradation of the RNAs possessing identical sequence. The VIGS approach is now widely used in functional genomics via transient silencing of the endogenous plant genes and assessing the resulting phenotypes. Although several plant viruses infecting both dicots and monocots were developed into VIGS vectors (Lacomme 2014) , one derived from TRV appears to be the most potent and most widely used in such studies (Bachan and Dinesh-Kumar 2012) .",

In vineyard settings, most of the grapevine viruses are transmitted either by invertebrate vectors, such as mites, mealybugs, or nematodes, or by grafting and top working, processes that are prohibitive for the use of engineered virus vectors. Furthermore, the systemic spread of the viruses in grapevine upon initial infection is slow, on a scale of months, another obstacle to facile development of useful virus vectors. Here, we will consider the most promising approaches to overcoming these problems and paving the way to broader implementation of the virus vector technologies suited for grapevine.",

Based on phylogenetic analysis, genome architecture, and transmission by distinct insect vectors, this family is classified into four virus genera: the aphid-transmitted Closterovirus, the mealybug-transmitted Ampelovirus, the whitefly-transmitted Crinivirus Karasev 2000) , and Velarivirus for which no insect vector is known (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Martelli et al. 2012) .

Originally, such a clone has been developed for Beet yellows virus (BYV), a prototype closterovirus (Dolja 2003; Peremyslov and Dolja 2007) . Due to the large size of BYV genome (15.5 kb), this development has been done in three steps. First, a full-length cDNA clone was generated and demonstrated to be replication-competent upon protoplast transfection with in vitro transcripts, allowing mapping of the replication-associated genes (Peremyslov et al. 1998 ). At the time, it was the largest cDNA clone available for any RNA virus. However, because this clone was defective in virus cell-to-cell movement, screening of additional BYV cDNA clones has been done, yielding variants competent in cell-to-cell movement ). Finally, due to relatively low infectivity of RNA transcripts upon mechanical inoculation, the viral cDNA has been cloned into a binary plasmid useful for agro-inoculation, a more efficient inoculation technique aided by agrobacteria that launch viral cDNA into plant cell nuclei, jump-starting its transcription followed by RNA translation and replication (Prokhnevsky et al. 2002) .",

Using these vectors was paramount to the identification of genes contributing to genome replication (Peng and Dolja 2000; Peremyslov et al. 1998) , virus cell-to-cell movement (Alzhanova et al. 2000; Peremyslov et al. 1999 Peremyslov et al. , 2004b , virion assembly (Napuli et al. 2000 Peremyslov et al. 2004a) , as well as the interdependence of the latter two processes (Alzhanova et al. 2001 (Alzhanova et al. , 2007 . Finally, two genes contributing to BYV systemic transport (Peng et al. 2003; Prokhnevsky et al. 2002 ) and a gene coding for a strong RNAi suppressor (Reed et al. 2003) were also identified, thus completing the functional characterization of the BYV genome (Dolja 2003) . It was later found that co-expression of strong suppressors of RNAi with the BYV cDNA increased the number of primarily infected cells upon agro-inoculation by up to three orders of magnitude, thus boosting the efficiency of this process (Chiba et al. 2006) . This phenomenon emphasized a critical role of a host RNAi defense in the virus invasiveness, that is, the ability to establish infection in the primarily inoculated cells.

            "text": "The studies of BYV provided the bulk of knowledge on the engineering of the closterovirus genome required to generate an analogous cDNA clone of GLRaV-2. There were, however, several features that distinguish the two viruses and had to be investigated before this task could be successfully accomplished. Unlike BYV, which has one papain-like leader proteinase that is required for efficient genome amplification and systemic infection (Peng et al. 2003; Peng and Dolja 2000) , GLRaV-2 has two such proteases that have likely evolved via gene duplication and functional divergence (Meng et al. 2005; Peng et al. 2001 ). Similar to other members of the family Closteroviridae, BYV is transmitted by aphids, whereas no aphid or other insect vectors are known for GLRaV-2, which, in agricultural settings, is transmitted exclusively by grafting or top working (Angelini et al., this book). This latter feature of GLRaV-2 is a positive attribute in regard to its vector potential, because it mitigates regulatory concerns for the uncontrolled spread of the modified virus via biological vectors. Perhaps, the most prominent biological differences between the two viruses is that BYV naturally infects several herbaceous hosts and is capable of exiting the phloem into surrounding tissues, whereas GLRaV-2 is only found in grapevine, where it is limited to phloem, similar to other grapevine viruses from the genera Ampelovirus and Velarivirus (Martelli et al. 2012) . Importantly, grapevine is a perennial woody host that is recalcitrant to mechanical inoculation by viruses, likely due to leaf hardiness defined both in physical and chemical terms. It should be emphasized, however, that unlike other closteroviruses of the leafroll disease complex, GLRaV-2 can be mechanically transmitted (albeit with difficulty) to a herbaceous plant, Nicotiana benthamiana, a promiscuous experimental host for a vast variety of plant viruses including BYV.",

            "text": "Because GLRaV-2 accumulates in N. benthamiana to higher levels than in grapevine, this convenient herbaceous host was used to isolate the virus, to sequence its genome and to engineer the first-generation full-length GLRaV-2 cDNA clone (Liu et al. 2009 ). Similar to the most advanced BYV clones, this GLRaV-2 clone possessed a strong 35S promoter derived from Cauliflower mosaic virus for viral cDNA transcription upon agro-inoculation ( Fig. 31.1) . A ribozyme sequence has been inserted downstream from the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide of the viral cDNA to facilitate release of the authentic viral RNA from a primary transcript, the termination of which was directed by the nopaline synthase terminator. This clone was tagged by insertion of the GFP open reading frame (ORF) downstream from the translation initiation codon of the viral capsid protein gene. Thus, a GFP-encoding recombinant subgenomic (sg) RNA has been produced under control of the native GLRaV-2 sgRNA promoter to direct GFP expression ( Fig. 31.1) . To restore expression of the GLRaV-2 capsid protein, a BYV sgRNA promoter that directs capsid protein expression in this closely related virus has been inserted downstream from the GFP stop codon (Liu et al. 2009 ). As was originally demonstrated for TMV (Donson et al. 1991) , the use of heterologous sgRNA promoters from similar viruses to express recombinant genes is superior to duplication of homologous promoters because the latter induce high rates of homologous recombination and rapid loss of the inserted genes.",

This virus-host combination has been used to determine contributions of the GLRaV-2 leader proteinases to polyprotein processing, RNA amplification, and long-distance transport (Liu et al. 2009 ). It was also found that each of the leader proteinases is required for virus invasiveness defined as an ability to establish infection in the primarily inoculated cells in grapevine. However, LR-GFP failed to establish systemic infection in the virus' natural host, grapevine, suggesting that propagation in N. benthamiana might have resulted in selection of a virus variant fit to reproduce in this herbaceous host, but not in grapevine. To test this possibility, the entire viral cDNA clone has been reassembled using cDNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription of the GLRaV-2 genomic RNA present in the infected grapevine. Only the fragments with a consensus sequences were used in this process to avoid incidental mutations that could emerge during error-prone virus replication or cDNA generation. The resulting reassembled cDNA clone vLR2-GFP contained as many as 75 single nucleotide differences compared to that of the N. benthamiana-propagated LR-GFP. Some of these differences could be due to natural variation between the two virus isolates used in this work, whereas others could have resulted from propagation of the original isolate in N. benthamiana. Strikingly, the vLR2-GFP was systemically infectious in grapevine upon vacuum agro-infiltration of the whole micropropagated plantlets that were transferred to soil following this process (Kurth et al. 2012) .",

Even in potyvirus vectors, in which there is selection pressure for the maintenance of the polyprotein-encoding open reading frame, a few weeks long propagation of the vector infection results in consistent appearance of variants with truncation or total loss of the expression cassette (Dolja et al. 1992; 1993) . This overall genetic instability was attributed to spontaneous nonhomologous recombination that shortens virus vector genome and gives the resulting variants competitive advantage over the intact vector genomes. The vLR2-GFP vector exhibited much greater genetic stability in a course of infection in grapevine. Only a fraction of vector-infected plants showed deletions within the expression cassette at 1 year postinoculation, providing an ample time window for using this vector for both research and applied purposes (Kurth et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "Further boost to the utility of vLR2 vectors was their ability to elicit strong virusinduced gene silencing (VIGS) response in the infected grapevine. Given that BYV and GLRaV-2 possess strong suppressors of RNAi (Chiba et al. 2006; Reed et al. 2003) , the VIGS capability of vLR2 was rather surprising. This capability was demonstrated via insertion into vLR2 expression cassette of the cDNA sequences derived from the endogenous grapevine genes encoding the enzymes required for chlorophyll biogenesis, phytoene desaturase (PDS), and subunit I of magnesiumprotoporphyrin IX chelatase (ChlI) (Kurth et al. 2012 ). The few hundred nucleotideslong fragments of the PDS or ChlI ORFs were engineered into vLR2 in either forward or reverse orientation (Fig. 31.1e) ; each of the four resulting vector variants caused strong VIGS response upon grapevine infection. This response was manifested as yellow or white chlorosis due to chlorophyll photobleaching that initially appeared along the leaf veins where virus replicated, gradually spreading into other leaf tissues (Fig. 31.1f ). Upon growth of the vines, VIGS symptoms appeared in cyclical manner apparently reflecting complex pattern of virus spread, VIGS response, and plant growth and differentiation. Once again, VIGS was well pronounced in plants for long periods of time, in excess of 17 months postinoculation (Dolja and Koonin 2013) . Although the mechanisms underlying unusual genetic stability of the vectors derived from closteroviruses including GLRaV-2 and CTV are not known, it seems possible that, similar to coronaviruses, closterovirus replication-associated polyproteins contain RNA-processing enzymatic domains with the proofreading activities (Denison et al. 2011) . By reducing the number of mismatches, and/or the replicase-template dissociation rate, these very large replication complexes could therefore reduce the frequency of deletions via copy-choice mechanism.",

However, the utility of such vectors could be limited by at least two important features related to the virus biology. One such feature is transmissibility by the insect vectors. For instance, GLRaV-1 and GLRaV-3 are transmitted by several mealybug and soft scale insect species raising a serious regulatory concern with the release of corresponding recombinant viruses into agricultural settings. Another problem is the relatively high pathogenicity of GLRaV-1 and GLRaV-3, each of which severely affects vine productivity and also results in gradual decline of infected plants (Maree et al. 2013) . Thus, tagging each of these viruses with a reporter such as GFP could be useful for investigating molecular and cellular biology of virus infection, but practical utility of the corresponding vectors is questionable at best.",

Furthermore, GLRaV-7 is not known to be transmitted by any vector organisms. Sequencing of the entire ~16.5 kb GLRaV-7 genome followed by phylogenetic analysis showed substantial divergence from each of the three previously established genera of the family Closteroviridae (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012 ). On the other hand, this analysis revealed a significant relatedness of GLRaV-7 with two other unclassified closterovirids also not known to elicit pronounced disease symptoms, Little cherry virus 1 and Cordyline virus-1 (Jelkmann et al. 1997; Melzer et al. 2011) .

Interestingly, the photobleaching phenotype exhibited in grapevine differed considerably from that in N. benthamiana. The photobleaching was not confined to the vascular tissue but rather was observed uniformly at leaf margins and later on the entire leaf blade (Muruganantham et al. 2009 ). This is quite different from the photobleaching induced by the GLRaV-2-based vector (Kurth et al. 2012) . In theory, both viruses are restricted to the phloem tissue and are expected to exhibit similar phenotypes when used to silence the PDS gene in grapevines. It remains to be elucidated if the difference in the phenotype due to silencing of PDS between the two viral vector systems is a reflection of the inherent difference between the two viruses, the different delivery systems, or the grapevine cultivars that were used by the two research groups.",

This offers significant advantage over viruses that have closed spherical structure. Lastly, infection with GRSPaV, at least with certain strains of the virus, causes no or very mild symptoms in most commercial grape cultivars. This is a very important consideration when choosing a virus as a vector because delivery of vectors derived from highly pathogenic viruses would lead to disease and symptoms that will interfere with the intended purpose of the vector (Zhang et al. 1998; Meng et al. 1998 Meng et al. , 1999 Meng et al. , 2005 Meng et al. , 2006 Meng and Gonsalves 2007) .

Importantly, the GFP-tagged variant successfully expressed GFP in both N. benthamiana and grapevine. Interestingly, the GFP-tagged clone was unable to move systemically in N. benthamiana. Perhaps GRSPaV has coevolved with and adapted to the grapevine host and as such is unable to move systemically in this herbaceous plant. This GFP-tagged variant was very slow at systemic movement in the grapevine, as demonstrated in a preliminary study (Meng et al. 2013) . Evidently, further testing of this GFP-tagged variant and the wild-type clone in different grapevine cultivars is necessary before the potential of GRSPaV as a protein expression or VIGS vector can be clearly established.",

An ability to tag virus genomes with reporter genes that has been pioneered in the potexvirus and potyvirus models (Chapman et al. 1992; Dolja et al. 1992 ) facilitated investigation of the virus infection cycle, including virus transport and interactions with the host. There is, however, an area of plant virology that is poorly explored due to difficulties of launching infections of the woody plants using viruses engineered to express reporter proteins. It is not known how these viruses manage to sustain multiyear infections in the voluminous and hostile environment of these plants. Are there aspects of virus-host interactions that are unique to woody and perennial plants compared to annual herbaceous plants? Rather intriguing initial insights to this question were provided using comparative genomics and the best developed models of woody plant viruses, CTV and GLRaV-2. In a CTV-citrus model, visualization of infection using the GFP reporter revealed complex and host species-specific patterns of virus-host interactions mostly reflected in the ability of the virus to spread systemically and from cell-to-cell in distinct phloem tissues. These patterns, as well as virus pathogenicity, are defined, in a large degree, by the CTV-specific genes that are dispensable for successful infection in some host species, but not in others (Dawson et al. 2013) . Although more limited, similar studies using GFP-tagged GLRaV-2 showed that the tandem leader proteinases L1 and L2 play grapevine host-specific roles in virus invasiveness (Liu et al. 2009 ); a likely function of these proteins in virus systemic spread in its natural host is yet to be explored.",

Sometimes, as is the case for CTV, such genes are found in only a single virus (see above). In other instances exemplified by AlkB (a gene encoding RNA demethylase), such genes are more broadly, but not universally, distributed among diverse viruses infecting woody or perennial plants (Martelli et al. 2007; van den Born et al. 2008) . Although it is assumed that AlkB could play a role in protecting viral RNA from methylation by enzymes that may constitute a host defense from long-term virus infections, the exact function of AlkB is yet to be addressed by means of reverse genetics. Although not all of the grapevine-infecting viruses possess AlkB, some of them, including GLRaV-3, GVA, and GRSPaV, do. Even though most of these questions pertain to fundamental research, answering them will facilitate both the practical application of virus-derived vectors and control of viral diseases.",

An additional potential benefit is that gene silencing triggered by VIGS is applicable to mature plants thus allowing the targeting of genes that could induce embryonic lethality if shut off permanently. As discussed above, the remarkable genetic stability of vLR2 VIGS variants provides years-long experimental window sufficient to determine phenotypes associated with seasonal development, e.g., flowering or berry ripening (Dolja and Koonin 2013) . On the other hand, it appears that the vLR2 has only a limited utility for producing beneficial proteins, e.g., \"edible vaccines,\" in grapevine, due to relatively low levels of recombinant protein expression and patchy distribution patterns throughout the plant, especially in berry clusters (Kurth et al. 2012) .",
