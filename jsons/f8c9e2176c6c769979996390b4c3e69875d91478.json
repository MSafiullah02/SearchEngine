It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus' pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 \u00b5M and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to >10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.",

Autophagy also functions as the first line of defense to cleanse the cell of invading pathogens such as viruses, and plays an important role in mediating the innate immune response (19) . The activation of autophagy engulfs virions inside host cells via the formation of autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with acidic lysosomes to form autolysosomes through a pH-dependent mechanism. The autolysosomal contents are then degraded by the lysosomal hydrolases. This entire autophagy cycle is called autophagic flux and plays a key role in processing invading viruses. In Drosophila, for example, NF-kB activation during Zika virus infection leads to elevated levels of Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes and increased autophagy in the brain (20) . Unfortunately, some viruses have developed mechanisms to escape autophagy (21) , avoid the immune response (22) , and hijack the autophagosomes for viral replication (23, 24) . Viral hijacking of the endocytic pathway for viral entry and utilization of the autophagic machinery for their replication has been reported (24, 25) . However, some conflicting data has demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication is independent of autophagic mechanisms (26) .",

One in particular is the disruption of the early steps in the viral life cycle including the release of the virus from the endosome when endocytosis is used for viral entry (31, 32) . Given the fact that the basic properties of CQ and similar molecules lead to their accumulation in acidic compartments and raise their pH, viruses that depend on low acidic pH for entry, uncoating, and replication can no longer execute these functions.

In this assay, host cell death is a consequence of the viral infection and cell viability is a surrogate readout for viral infection that can be measured with a range of cell viability assays. All compounds were tested in doseresponse, and 'hit' antiviral compounds are those that protect the host cells from viral CPE. To increase infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE assay, we used a clone of Vero-E6 that had previously been selected for high ACE2 expression (35) . The cell viability measurements were normalized to cells not infected with the virus (100% activity) and untreated cells infected with virus (0% activity; virus completely kills cells). As a counter-assay, all compounds were tested against cells not exposed to virus, in order to identify compounds that exerted cytotoxicity against Vero E6 cells.",

In Vero-E6 cells, increases in intracellular LC3B spot, also called spots, were concentration-dependent for all of the compounds except for mefloquine (Fig. 4A,B) . CQ, HCQ, and hycanthone treatment produced maximal spot counts, while ROC-325 and clomipramine produced a submaximal increase of 80% and 40%, respectively. Mefloquine was ineffective at inducing LC3B spot accumulation. Increases in LC3B spots indicate an accumulation of LC3B that is localized to the autophagosome when autophagic flux is blocked. The potent effect of CQ and HCQ on LC3B spot counts was apparent in all cell lines tested ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S1 , 3, 5) . Based on nuclei counts, CQ, HCQ, clomipramine, and ROC-325 were not cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (50 \u00b5M for all except for ROC-325 at 25 \u00b5M). In line with the drug toxicity data from the CPE assay, mefloquine was completely toxic at 50 \u00b5M, while hycanthone killed approximately 60% of cells at 50 \u00b5M. The compound CC50 data was consistent between the two assays.",

            "text": "New anti-viral drug repurposing opportunities are necessary for pre-clinical and clinical evaluation for treating COVID-19. In this work we have identified several autophagy inhibitors that can protect against CPE of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells. ROC-325 (38-40) and clomipramine (41, 42) display autophagy inhibitor activity that can completely prevent SARS-CoV-2 CPE without any significant inherent cytotoxicity. Hycanthone, an FDA-approved schistosomicide and oxidative metabolite of lucanthone (43) (44) (45) , and mefloquine (46) (47) (48) both showed moderate levels of activity against SARS-CoV-2 CPE, but did exhibit drug-induced cell toxicity at the highest drug concentration tested (up to 30 \u00b5M) . The autophagy inhibitor verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative used in the clinic as a photosensitizer (49), did not inhibit CPE of SARS-CoV-2, and was not tested in follow-up autophagy assays. To confirm whether CPE protecting compounds interrupted cellular autophagy and lysosomal function, we examined their effects on autophagy marker LC3B (50) (58) . The potencies of drug protection against virally-induced cell death can be lower than in other assays that directly measure viral load. Nevertheless, this study confirms that SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells results in cell death similar to other reports, and that CPE can be suppressed by blocking autophagy with small molecule inhibitors to the same extent as positive control remdesivir (59, 60) . Recently, a drug-repurposing screen of FDA-approved compounds, using a similar CPE assay with SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells, found clomipramine (IC 50 5 .93 \u00b5M; CC 50 >30 \u00b5M) and mefloquine (IC50 7.11 \u00b5M; CC50 >18.5 \u00b5M) to be active with low toxicity (61) . The same study found HCQ to be more active than CQ with an IC50 of 9.21 \u00b5M and 42.03 \u00b5M, respectively. Mefloquine was also found to be active in another SARS-CoV-2 CPE screen using Caco-2 cells with an IC50 of 14.1 \u00b5M (62) . In our study, the SI was calculated using the ratio of the EC50, the half-maximal effective concentration, and the CC50, the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration. Between the CPE and the autophagy assays there was good correspondence in the cytotoxicity measurements by CellTiter-Glo and nuclei counts, respectively. The SI is an important measure for future preclinical development, as it provides insights into the potential clinical safety of a compound at a cellular level. From this work, we show that CQ, HCQ, clomipramine, and ROC-325 were less than 50% cytotoxic at all concentrations, whereas mefloquine and hycanthone were cytotoxic at the highest concentrations with mefloquine being the most cytotoxic.",

ORF-8b also forms aggregates in cells that caused ER stress and lysosome malfunction, which could be responsible for reduced clearance of viral particles by autophagic flux (63) . The nonstructural protein 6 (NSP-6) of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, significantly increased the number of autophagosomes in host cells (28) . The SARS-CoV accessory protein ORF-3a has three transmembrane domains that insert into the lysosomal membrane causing lysosome function dysregulation and necrotic cell death (27) . Recently, Benvenuto and colleagues analyzed 351 available SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences and discussed that the mutations in NSP-6 may modify the virus' activity for inducing autophagy, though experimental data was not presented (21) . It appears paradoxical that viral infection inhibits autophagic clearance while autophagy inhibitors, also known to block autophagosome to lysosome fusion, suppress viral infection. Our data, combined with the reported mechanism of action for CQ as an antiviral, suggest that these autophagy inhibitors may interrupt the early steps in the viral life ROC-325 was originally developed as an orally available inhibitor of autophagy designed to incorporate the chemical motifs of HCQ and lucanthone, with the goal of both improved autophagic inhibition and consequent single-agent anticancer activity (39, 45) . ROC-325 is a preclinical candidate, with low in vitro and in vivo toxicity and strong anti-cancer properties (40, 70) . Our study shows that it may also be a candidate for repositioning as a treatment for COVID-19. Clomipramine, a centrally acting, FDA-approved, tricyclic antidepressant used for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain (71, 72) may also be an interesting preclinical candidate with its existing regulatory status easing a path towards use in the clinic, although the human Cmax does not cover the CPE EC50. Because most of these compound EC50 values were higher than their human plasma concentrations at the clinically efficacious doses, they likely will not be efficacious as single agents for the treatment of COVID-19 (Table 2) . Indeed, toxicity with CQ and HCQ has been reported and caution has to be taken with its clinical application because of potential cardiotoxicity (73) . Furthermore, a large observational trial did not find a reduction in death of patients taking HCQ, which suggests that large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the true benefit to patients with regard to decreased mortality rate and duration of hospitalization (74) . However, the sum of this work indicates that targeting steps of the viral life cycle in cells with molecules similar to CQ, focusing on their anti-autophagic properties, could be a valid drug discovery strategy for combating SARS-CoV-2. The compounds described here also have value as research tools to better understand the interplay between host autophagy pathway and viral live cycle.",

Furthermore, individual drug concentrations can be lowered in combination therapies to prevent the toxicity seen at higher doses when treating with a single drug. Further tests of the drug combination therapy using SARS-CoV-2 animal models will be needed to confirm the therapeutic usage of these compounds.",

We found that the activities of autophagy inhibition as measured by LC3B spot counts correlated well with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 measured in the CPE assay for ROC-325, clomipramine, hycanthone, and mefloquine. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that ROC-325 and hycanthone are efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. The 72 h SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay measures the phenotypic consequence of viral infection and replication in cells (51-53). SARS-CoV-2 can induce cell death (54-57) after 48 to 72 h of infection, and thus cell viability is a surrogate measure of viral replication in vitro. However, there are limitations to the CPE assay including its dependence on the host response and the fact that it is an indirect measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The phenotypic outcome can also vary depending on culture conditions and viral multiplicity of infection (MOI), number of virions that are added per cell during infection",

However, more work is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of action for these autophagy inhibitors in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and the impact at the different stages of the viral life cycle. Other host targets for viral inhibition include the point of entry with clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus (65), p38 MAPK involved in viral replication (66), post-translational processing of viral proteins in the Golgi apparatus (67), and budding of the virus from the infected cell (68, 69).",
