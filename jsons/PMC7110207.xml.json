Supplementation increased progeny weaning BW and increased fertility of heifer progeny (Stalker et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2007). Corn crop residue (CR) remaining after grain harvest provided a winter grazing alternative more economical than feeding harvested forage (Adams et al., 1996). Further, CR grazing reduced breakeven costs of weaned calves or finished steers compared with systems relying on winter grazing of dormant cool-season pasture supplemented with harvested forage (Anderson et al., 2005).",

One hundred nine pregnant, spring-calving cows (498 \u00b1 15 kg initial BW) between 3 and 5 yr of age were stratified by age and weaning BW of their previous calf and assigned randomly to treatment in yr 1. Cows remained on the same treatment for the length of the study, unless removed due to reproductive failure or injury. Pregnant 3-yr-old cows were stratified by age and weaning BW of their previous calf and assigned randomly to treatment to replace cows removed from the study and to increase numbers as forage availability allowed.

Dietary nutrient composition was estimated from masticate samples obtained from 3 esophageally fistulated cows per field. Cows were withheld from feed for 12 h, then fitted with screen bottom bags after removal of the esophageal plug. Cows were allowed to graze for about 30 min to obtain samples. Masticate samples were freeze-dried and analyzed for CP (AOAC 990.03, 1990), NDF (Van Soest et al., 1991), and ADF (AOAC 973.18, 1990). Supplement nutrient composition, including UIP concentration of the feedstuffs, was calculated from tabular values (NRC, 1996). From late November until early March each year, cows grazing winter range were divided into four 32-ha upland pastures; 2 pastures received PS, 2 did not. Upland range sites at GSL are dominated by little bluestem [Andropogon scoparius (Michx.) Nash], prairie sandreed [Calamovilfa longifolia (Hook.) Scribn.], sand bluestem (Andropogon hallii Hack.), sand lovegrass [Eragrostis trichoides (Nutt.) Wood], and blue grama [Bouteloua gracillis (H.K.B.) Lag. Ex Griffiths] (Adams et al., 1998). From November to March each year, cows grazing CR were maintained in 4 fields; 2 fields received PS, 2 did not. Cows were shipped approximately 84 km to corn residue fields on November 15th and returned to GSL on February 25th the following year. The corn fields were irrigated, planted in April, and harvested in October, with an average annual yield of 12,544 kg/ha. On a pasture or field basis, cows received the equivalent of 0.45 kg/d of a 28% CP (DM basis) supplement 3 times/wk or no CP supplement from December 1 until February 28 on WR or until February 25th on CR. The supplement contained 62.0% dried distillers grains plus solubles, 10.6% wheat middlings, 9.0% cottonseed meal, 5.0% dried corn gluten feed, 5.0% molasses, 3.0% calcium carbonate, and 2.0% urea on a DM basis (Table 1). Additionally, the supplement was formulated to meet vitamin and trace mineral requirements of the 3-yr-old cows and supply 80 mg\u2022animal\u22121\u2022d\u22121 of monensin (Rumensin, Elanco Animal Health, Indianapolis, IN).",

All nonfeeding costs, including veterinary charges, implant cost, trucking, and yardage were charged at an additional $0.50/d. The sale value of steers at slaughter was calculated from the average carcass base price and grid adjustments reported by USDA Agricultural Marketing Service for each individual slaughter date (USDA-AMS, 2008b,c). These prices were used to calculate the total cost of feeding and were added to the cost of the steer calf at weaning to arrive at a total feedlot cost.

For variables where the interactive effect of winter grazing and PS is significant (P \u2264 0.05), with the exceptions of precalving BCS and carcass value, the difference between the interaction of CR-PS and CR-NS is not different (P > 0.05). Thus, only the difference between WR-PS and WR-NS will be discussed hereafter. Cow BW and BCS after the winter grazing period and before parturition were affected by the winter grazing system and CP supplementation. Cows grazing CR between November and March were 42 kg heavier (P < 0.001) than counterparts grazing WR. In addition, cows receiving PS during late gestation, from December until March, were 23 kg heavier (P < 0.001) than NS cows. In particular, cows grazing WR with NS were 37 kg lighter (P = 0.02) and had BCS approximately 0.37 points less (P = 0.10) than similarly grazed cows receiving PS. These results are similar to Stalker et al. (2006), who reported cows grazing winter range lost 29 kg and 0.6 BCS if not PS, but maintained both if they received 0.45 kg/d of 42% CP supplement during this period. Calving date was nearly 5 d later (P = 0.01) for NS cows grazing WR compared with all other treatments. This is in contrast to Stalker et al. (2006), who found cows supplemented in late gestation calved later than nonsupplemented cows. However, in that study, cows did not remain on the same treatment for all 3 yr of the study; rather a switchback design was utilized. Thus, because calving date is delayed in the current experiment where cows remained on the same treatment for 3 yr, it may represent a cumulative carryover effect of continued nutritional stress. There were also at least 16% fewer (P = 0.03) WR-NS cows that calved in the first 21 d compared with all other treatments, reinforcing the increase in calf birth date. Perhaps this is a reflection of differences in conception date, which would indicate WR-NS conceived later in the breeding season.",

This is somewhat surprising because previous research using the same cowherd did not find differences in calf birth BW due to supplementation of dams grazing winter range (Stalker et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2007). Once again, this may be a cumulative effect of remaining on the NS treatment. The differences, although significant, are rather small in the current study. In an earlier study, heifers offered a high energy ration 100 d before calving gave birth to heavier calves than heifers offered a low energy diet (Corah et al., 1975). Additionally, increasing BCS before parturition has been demonstrated to increase calf birth BW (Spitzer et al., 1995; Stalker et al., 2007). The increase in prepartum BCS demonstrated in this study and by Stalker et al. (2007) resulted from CP supplementation during late gestation. This provides evidence supplemental nutrition, including energy or CP, during late gestation can increase cow BCS and calf birth BW. Calf BW in May was increased (P < 0.001) by CP supplementation if cows grazed WR but not CR. This may indicate a differential effect of CP on fetal programming of nutrient-restricted dams, resulting in efficiency differences of the calf as we demonstrate no effect of PS on May milk production.",

The weaning BW difference mirrors the improvement observed in May calf BW between the same groups.

The difference was nearly one-half of a grade and may represent an economically important change, as will be discussed further. Whereas there was only a tendency (P = 0.07) for a difference, steers from CR cows with NS had a decreased ratio of marbling per unit of yield grade, indicating they may be less valuable when marketed on a grid basis. Perhaps more importantly, a greater proportion (P = 0.04) of steers born to PS cows achieved USDA quality grades of Choice or greater. Notably, the magnitude of difference was only 8% if their dams grazed WR, but 23.6% if their dams grazed CR over the winter. In addition, more (P = 0.03) steers from PS dams graded USDA Modest or greater than steers from NS dams. Although dam grazing system did not affect (P = 0.57) quality grade, these data highlight a potential fetal programming effect of late gestation supplementation on subsequent steer progeny intramuscular fat deposition. Using only cows grazing WR, Stalker et al. (2006) were unable to identify any significant differences in steer progeny feedlot or carcass performance. However, they did note a tendency (P = 0.16) for increased proportions of steers grading USDA Choice or greater if their dams were supplemented with CP during late gestation, with a comparable magnitude of difference achieved in the current study. The increase in percentage grading USDA Choice with PS, without a concomitant increase in yield grade, translated into a $47 advantage (P = 0.005; Table 7) in carcass value over steers from NS cows.",

            "text": "As stated previously, fetal programming may explain the improvement in percentage USDA Choice with dam PS. Fetal growth progresses rapidly during the last trimester of gestation. Added nutrition during this period may alter the site of nutrient deposition. Early work by Smith and Crouse (1984) suggest glucose is the primary substrate utilized by intramuscular adipocytes. Furthermore, concentrate diets may increase the glucose uptake of intramuscular adipose cells (Rhoades et al., 2007). This is potentially due to increased insulin associated with concentrate feeding. Thus, under low quality range conditions when ruminants are increasingly insulin insensitive (Waterman et al., 2007), concentrate supplementation may increase insulin and subsequent glucose uptake of intramuscular adipocytes. Some data indicate a positive effect of a high concentrate diet early in life on quality grade at slaughter (Schoonmaker et al., 2003; Meyer et al., 2005). Feeding a high concentrate diet to early weaned steers increased serum insulin relative to high roughage diets (Schoonmaker et al., 2003). Grazing cows on improved pasture during late gestation increased the number of subcutaneous adipocytes in subsequent steer progeny relative to cows grazing native range (Underwood et al., 2008). Conversely, when ewes were nutritionally restricted during early gestation, adipose tissue volume was increased (Bispham et al., 2003). There appears to be a differential effect of maternal nutrition on fetal adiposity during various periods of gestation.",

(2006) did not find a positive effect of CP supplementation on quality grade; however, the supplement used contained approximately 42% CP (31% UIP) from predominately sunflower (50%) and cottonseed (48%) meals. The current study utilized a supplement containing 28% CP (48% UIP) from predominately DDGS (62%), wheat middlings (11%), and cottonseed meal (9%). Thus, increased UIP concentration may have changed AA supply and glucose production, affecting preadipocyte development and the propensity for developing intramuscular fat later in life. Increased CP in the ration has been shown to increase starch digestion and absorption in the small intestine along with increasing insulin concentration (Lopez et al., 2001). These data suggest a potential fetal programming effect of late-gestation cow supplementation on subsequent steer progeny intramuscular fat deposition.",

There was no effect (P > 0.68; Table 5) of winter grazing system on percentage of steers treated for illness in any period. Furthermore, whereas PS did not affect (P = 0.91) health from birth until weaning, more (P = 0.05) calves from NS cows received treatment for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) between weaning and slaughter than steers from PS dams. Studies have demonstrated calves receiving treatment for BRD have decreased quality grades compared with steers not receiving treatment (Gardner et al., 1999; Busby et al., 2004). Busby et al. (2004) indicated one treatment reduced carcass quality (445 vs. 465 marbling score, treated and untreated, respectively; where 400 = small0), and subsequent treatments reduced it further. Treating calves for BRD also increased the propensity for grading USDA Standard, and the presence of lung lesions at slaughter were associated with reduced quality grades (Gardner et al., 1999). In the current study, nearly 10% more steers (P = 0.05) from NS cows required treatment for BRD and PS improved marbling scores (444 vs. 492 marbling score, NS and PS, respectively; P = 0.004). Thus, PS may have influenced quality grade through calf health. To our knowledge, this is the first report of maternal nutrition during late gestation influencing calf health after weaning without an effect on preweaning health.",

Not only does nutrition of the dam affect calf birth BW and early BW gains, but this difference also persists through weaning and slaughter. This may indicate more than a transient change in physiology. It also appears maternal CP supplementation influences health of steer progeny in the feedlot. This hypothesis is further supported by an alteration in fatness and quality grade of steer progeny. It appears CP supplementation improves value of calves at weaning and the value of steers at slaughter regardless of winter grazing treatment. As rising input prices continue to affect cow/calf production, beef producers will turn to alternative feed sources. It is imperative to understand not only how these changes will affect the dam, but also what the lifelong effects may be on the calf.",
