Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show typical absorbance traces at 250 and 405 nm of the R298A mutant during the experiment at a substrate concentration of 200 mM. After fitting the 250 nm signals to the continuous size-distribution model, it was obvious that the R298A mutant was monomeric (2.1 S) in the absence of substrate (Fig. 1c , solid lines), whereas it was dimeric (2.8 S) at a substrate concentration of 200 mM (Fig. 1c, dashed lines) . Somewhat surprisingly, at a substrate concentration of 40 mM the major species (2.3 S) of the R298A mutant was located between the monomer and the dimer (Fig. 1c, dotted lines) . According to previous studies, these results suggested that the R298A mutant is a rapid self-association protein, similar to wild-type M pro (Cheng et al., 2010) . These observations using AEC confirmed the substrate-induced dimerization of the R298A mutant. Moreover, after calculating the initial velocities from signals at 405 nm and then fitting them to the Michaelis-Menten equation (inset in Figs. 1b and 1d) , an apparent K m of 380 mM and an apparent k cat of 0.012 s \u00c01 were calculated. These values are very close to those for wild-type M pro from AEC analysis . This confirmed that the dimeric R298A protein is functionally the same as that of wildtype M pro . However, based on the crystal structure of the monomeric R298A mutant (Shi et al., 2008) , the transition from monomer to dimer should be impossible because of the dramatic rotation of domain III and the formation of a short 3 10 -helix from an active-site loop; these changes result in the catalytic machinery being frozen in a collapsed state. Furthermore, recent studies suggested that the R298E mutant maintained N-terminal autocleavage activity comparable to that of wild-type M pro , although it did cause complete dimer dissociation and disruption of trans-cleavage activity . This indicated that N-terminal autocleavage of M pro is not dependent on a 'mature' dimeric protease, but on an (c) Substrate-binding cavities mapped onto the current structure. Both protomers show a large and deep cavity (magenta surface representation) near the catalytic dyad, which is essentially the same as that in wild-type M pro at pH 7.6, although wild-type M pro at pH 6.0 shows one active protomer and one inactive protomer (Yang et al., 2003) . The cavity was calculated using DS Modeling 1.7 (Accelrys) and was drawn using Discovery Studio Visualizer 2.5 (Accelrys). 'intermediate' or 'loose' dimer (Chen et al., 2010) . On the other hand, we have expressed and purified an R298A mutant with an N-terminal extension similar to that of the R298E mutant . However, the mutant lost its transcleavage activity (less than 0.8%) and failed to form a dimer even in the presence of peptide substrates ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 1 ) . Efforts to crystallize the N-terminally extended R298A mutant were also unsuccessful. To delineate the mechanism for the conversion of M pro from an inactive monomer to a functional dimer, we next determined the crystal structure of the dimeric R298A mutant at a resolution of 2.09 \u00c5 (Table 1) . It is important to note that we used an R298A mutant with an authentic N-terminus and a C-terminus with eight extra residues (LEH 6 ) for convenience in purification.

There is a minor change in orientation between the two copies of domain III and therefore the r.m.s.d. value decreases to 0.28 \u00c5 when domain III is excluded. The overall structure of the dimeric R298A mutant is similar to other structures of SARS-CoV M pro reported previously. For example, the r.m.s.d. between equivalent C atoms of this dimeric structure and the structure of wild-type M pro at pH 8.0 is 0.59 \u00c5 (Yang et al., 2003) .

Unfortunately, we cannot observe the complete electron density of the peptide substrate, even though there is some residual electron density near the His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad of subunit A (green mesh in Fig. 2d) . To evaluate the possible substrate-binding mode in this structure, we generated a model with the P3-P1 substrate residues (Val-Leu-Gln) based on the structure of the C145A mutant (Hsu, Kuo et al., 2005) . In the model, the side chains of P1 Gln and P2 Leu are able to fill the residual electron density and an O atom of the carboxyl group of P1 Gln is located in the oxyanion hole (Fig. 2d) . In contrast, in subunit B there is no residual electron density at the same position, suggesting that the statuses of the two active sites in the dimer may not be identical, although the amide N atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 in each subunit are oriented into the oxyanion hole. In addition, most of the residues in the active site, including Phe140, His163, Glu166, His172 and the catalytic dyad His41/Cys145, are in the same positions as those of wild-type M pro (Yang et al., 2003) .

This rotation allows steric hindrance between the two copies of domain III during dimerization to be avoided. The variability of the mutual domain arrangement suggests that conversion from the monomeric form to the dimeric form is feasible.

Most importantly, the key stacking interaction between the rings of Phe140 and His163, which is important to prevent His163 from being protonated (Yang et al., 2003) , are maintained (Fig. 2d) . This ensures that His163 can efficiently interact with the side chain of P1 Gln. In contrast to the collapsed substrate-binding site in the R298A monomer (Shi et al., 2008) , there is a large and complete substrate-binding pocket in each subunit (Fig. 3c) .

Interestingly, we found that there is a hydrogen-bonding interaction between residues Ser284 and Thr285 0 in the I-J loop, while there is a water molecule between the two Thr285 residues in the structure of wild-type M pro (Fig. 4b) . The direct contact between the two I-J loops leads to a shift of the I and J helices, further causing the change in the orientation of the whole domain III. This observation also suggests that the two copies of the folded domain III are able to bind to each other by this interaction at the initial stage and to wait until the swapping of the -helix to form a three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer or a more stable and super-active octameric M pro Kang et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 165, "text": "(Yang et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 166, "end": 183, "text": "Zhu et al., 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1199, "text": "Kang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 494, "text": "(Fig. 4a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 720, "end": 729, "text": "(Fig. 4b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Reorganization of the dimer in the R298A mutant"}, {"text": "Furthermore, in the present structure each domain III is even closer to domains I and II of the other subunit, although subunit A shows a larger change in orientation than subunit B.

A similar assembly can also be observed in the structures of authentic wild-type M pro (PDB entry 2h2z) and its complex with a peptide aldehyde inhibitor (PDB entry 3snd), although in these two structures the Arg298 residues do not interact with Ser123 of the other subunit (Figs. 4c and 4d; Xue et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011) . This suggests that M pro may not require all of the possible intermolecular interactions for dimerization, especially in the presence of substrates or peptidyl inhibitors. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that Glu166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate-binding site to the dimer interface (Yang et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010) . In our structure, the interactions between the mainchain amide of Ser1 with the carboxyl group of the Glu166 side chain of the other subunit provide direct evidence to explain why the mutation at Glu166 blocks substrate-induced dimerization of M pro (Cheng et al., 2010) .
