As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses depend on cellular cofactors, and in that sense, a definition of the \u201cinfectious particle\u201d would include not just the virally encoded proteins but also the cellular proteins that enable replication to occur. Moreover, the cellular tools that are available to the virus will depend on cell type, cell cycle status, differentiation state, and extracellular mediators that may influence metabolism (e.g., cytokines and hormones). Such differences may affect how the virus replicates and spreads. For example, certain cell types may be able to alter viral replication in an effort to limit the cytopathicity that might otherwise result from an unrestricted infection. Recent evidence indicates that central nervous system (CNS) neurons possess survival skills that influence the replication of neurotropic RNA viruses and moderate the activity of the resulting antiviral response",

Engagement of the T cell receptor with the peptide-loaded MHC leads to perforation of the target cell membrane, delivery of cytolytic granules, and apoptosis of the infected cell [1]. In most tissues, the loss of infected cells is accompanied by enhanced uninfected cell division to replenish the cell population. However, this may not be an optimal strategy for clearance of all viral infections, especially those in tissues with little capacity for renewal, such as the CNS [2, 3]",

Collectively, these properties of the CNS contribute to an \u201cimmune privileged\u201d environment under normal conditions. Nevertheless, activated T lymphocytes patrol the CNS parenchyma [5, 6] and are recruited into the brain after infection by many neurotropic viruses [7\u20139]. In some circumstances, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, such inflammatory responses are associated with marked CNS damage [8]. In others the immune response is able to resolve an infection without apparent damage to the host (e.g., the immune-mediated clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) [10]. These data suggest that the CNS has unique strategies to recruit the immune response following a pathogenic challenge and to promote clearance mechanisms that prevent or limit immunopathology. Understanding how these defenses work and how chronic CNS disease occurs when they fail is of paramount importance in the development of appropriate therapies to prevent or reverse virus-induced neuropathology",

Such engagement results in leukocyte activation and increased adhesion to capillary endothelia. In the brain, infection by a number of viruses has been correlated with a rapid and robust induction of chemokines from multiple resident cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells [13\u201317]. Moreover, specific chemokine neutralizing antibodies and knockout mice have been valuable tools in demonstrating the crucial role chemokines play in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS. For example, Lane et al. [15] showed that administration of RANTES neutralizing antisera to C57BL/6 mice infected with neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) reduced macrophage accumulation and resultant demyelination as compared with control mice, implicating a protective role for RANTES in this model system",

            "text": "Whether neurons contribute to the recruitment of leukocytes to the CNS after viral infection has not been established. To address this issue, we used a transgenic mouse model in which viral infection was restricted to CNS neurons. In this system, a human measles virus (MV) receptor, CD46, was expressed specifically in CNS neurons under the transcriptional control of the rat neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter [18]. NSE-CD46 transgenic mice supported infection by MV-Edmonston and adult mice mounted aggressive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses that protected them from neurologic impairment and death [19]. We recently showed that MV challenge of NSE-CD46+ mice results in a potent induction of T cell\u2013recruiting chemokines in infected neurons. We used RNAse protection assays to show induced expression of the chemokines IP-10 and RANTES in infected adult brains and in infected primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Confocal microscopy studies further demonstrated that viral antigens and chemokines colocalize in infected neurons (unpublished data). In vivo depletion of IP-10, RANTES, and monokine-induced interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 from immunocompetent adult mice reduced the infiltration of T cells in infected mouse brains by up to 60% and was correlated with increased neuronal MV infection. Thus, these studies suggest that neurons may play a crucial and early role in the host response to infection by triggering the rapid production of chemokines that help to alert and focus the antiviral response to the infected CNS",

Walker et al. [20] first speculated that CD8 T cells produce a factor that slows human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in the absence of cell death. Subsequently, Guidotti and colleagues [21, 22], by using transgenic mice that expressed the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome in hepatocytes, showed that CTL-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 noncytolytically inhibited HBV replication [21, 22]",

Monocyte/macrophage-elaborated cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 are also involved in the resolution of viral infections. Not only does IL-12 skew the T helper response toward a Th1 profile, it can directly promote noncytopathic recovery from neurotropic infection by regulating nitric oxide synthesis [26, 28, 38]. Thus, cytokines contribute to viral clearance directly (by inhibiting virus replication) and indirectly (e.g., by inducing other inflammatory cytokines).

In susceptible fibroblasts, MV infection is highly productive and cytolytic; viral spread occurs by the production of extracellular progeny and by the fusion of infected cells with adjacent uninfected cells. In neurons, MV spread occurs in the absence of extracellular virus, syncytia formation, or neuronal lysis. Decreased virus production correlates with an inability of MV to form buds at the neuronal plasma membrane [42]. MV transmission throughout these neuron cultures is not inhibited by neutralizing antibodies, paralleling rabies studies in which neutralizing antibodies are less effective in preventing spread in neurons than in nonneuronal cells [43]. Together, these data indicate a novel mechanism of MV transmission in neurons [42, 44]. EM studies of neuronal infection with wild type MV strains revealed the presence of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) at the neuronal synapse [42, 45], supporting earlier observations by researchers who used mouse-adapted strains [46, 47]",

Thus, while neurons may place restrictions on viral replication to limit cytopathicity, viruses may in turn encode proteins that facilitate neuronal transport. Of interest, while the CD46 receptor is required for initial MV entry in the NSE-CD46 transgenic system, it is not needed for subsequent neuron-neuron spread [42]. The lack of requirement for CD46 may mean that the hemagglutinin protein that interacts with the cellular receptor may also be dispensable for neuronal infection, although for other RNA viruses that spread via the synapse, such as rabies, a requirement for the viral surface proteins was noted [49]",

The opposite occurs in NSE-CD46 transgenic mice after MV infection: Infection of neonates is lethal but infection of adults results in viral clearance [18, 19]. In both cases, the differential outcome of infection is due to immunologic differences: In the LCMV-infected adult mice, for example, death is due to a vigorous CTL response that results in choriomeningitis, edema, and mortality [41]. However, age-related differences in response to viral infection may also be due to the differentiated status of the infected neuron [51]. For example, infection of mouse neurons with the A7(74) strain of Semliki Forest virus causes mortality in neonatal animals but not in adults due to the inability of virus to bud from adult neurons [52, 53]. While the exact nature of this abortive infection remains under study, the metabolism of rapidly dividing neurons differs substantially from that of fully differentiated nondividing neurons. Differences such as axonogenesis and myelination likely have a significant impact on the mechanics of viral replication",

This \u201csudden change\u201d in the dynamics of CNS infection is a third possible way in which persisting neurotropic infections may cause disease.

Viral RNA isolated from patients who died of MV-induced SSPE consistently contained biased hypermutations in the envelope-associated genes, matrix, fusion and hemagglutinin [63, 64], which may be associated with induction of CNS disease.

Neurons possess strategies to curtail viral replication, rapidly recruit the antiviral immune response to the brain parenchyma, and exploit noncytolytic effector mechanisms of viral clearance. Further efforts to understand how the neuronal microenvironment alters the virus life cycle will affect our understanding of both viruses and neurons. Moreover, the presence of many subpopulations of CNS neurons implies that neurons in different regions of the brain may respond to viral infections in unique ways. A better understanding of the complex interaction between pathogens and the immune response in the brain will contribute to the development of therapies to prevent or reverse viral infections of neurons and the diseases they cause",
