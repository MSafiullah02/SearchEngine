Ecohealth is anthropocentric, but has an emphasis on optimising ecosystem health to benefit human health. It is traditionally applied in a development context: socioeconomic development activities give rise to social factors (e.g. poverty reduction) which improve health but also ecological factors (e.g. natural resource depletion) which threaten health. These factors are exacerbated by social inequity factors (Charron 2012b). Ecosystem approaches use an action-research framework informed by six principles: systems thinking, transdisciplinarity (incorporating nonacademic knowledge of communities and decision makers), multi-stakeholder participation, sustainability, social and gender equity and knowledge-to-action (Charron 2012b).",

            "text": "Ecological approaches to public health, represented mainly by the field of environmental health, seek to understand and mitigate physical and social environmental factors affecting health. The effect of the environment on health has long been recognised: in the 18th century, Vicq d\u2019Azyr linked climate and geographical circumstances to epidemics (Bresalier et al. 2015). However, the germ theory of disease brought about the era of infectious epidemiology (Susser and Susser 1996a), with its reductionist focus on the specific pathogens causing disease diverting attention away from environmental determinants (Bresalier et al. 2015). In the twentieth century, infectious epidemiology gave way to chronic disease epidemiology, which highlighted behavioural risk factors for disease (Pearce 1996; Susser and Susser 1996a). The ecological approach to public health was revived in the 1970s due to increasing appreciation of social environmental factors, e.g. poverty, poor education, unequal power resulting in health inequality (Dakubo 2010). The Lalonde report laid the foundations for the revival: it set out biological, physical and social environments, behavioural and healthcare as the four fundamental determinants of health (Lalonde 1974), and the 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion advocated health promotion using an ecological approach (WHO 1986). More recently, the field of eco-epidemiology has emerged (Susser and Susser 1996b), which focusses on the interactions between physical and social environmental factors. Emerging in the late nineteenth century, the field of ecology studies the interactions of populations, communities, and biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem (Odum 1971). The ecology-and-health approach can address more complex problems than the traditional environmental health approach, specifically interactions between health determinants and indirect effects on health. This was furthered by the emergence of human ecology (Parkes et al. 2003).",

The first International Ecohealth Forum was held in Montreal in 2003, and in 2004, the IDRC founded the Ecohealth journal, merging previous journals Ecosystem Health and Global Change and Human Health. The IDRC established the International Association for Ecology and Health (IAEH) in 2006, to organise the Ecohealth movement globally and curate the journal (Charron 2012a). Other important international initiatives include the International Panel on Climate Change which addressed the health risks of climate change and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment which identified the links between ecosystem services and human health (Parkes 2011; Charron 2012b).",

Virchow founded the field of cellular pathology, whilst Osler played a key role in both medical and veterinary education (Kahn et al. 2007).

This disease emerged in Malaysia and was first realised to affect pigs and humans through the work of medical and veterinary virologists. Fruit bats were then identified as a major wildlife reservoir of Nipah virus. Pig farming in fruit tree plantations where bats used to forage led to pigs consuming fruit contaminated by bat saliva containing the virus, developing respiratory symptoms and subsequently transmitting the virus to farmers. This led to control strategies based around keeping pigs away from plantations. However, ecosystem studies were required to reveal the ecological drivers of plantation colonisation by fruit bats, such as the potential association of bat movements with deforestation, and highlight the broader issue of ecosystem management (Daszak et al. 2001; Field et al. 2001; Chua et al. 2002; Pulliam et al. 2012).",

In the years before 1997, it was found that butchers slaughtered water buffalo, infected with echinococcosis tapeworm cysts, in open sites along the Bishnumati River. Offal was consumed by dogs, the cysts they contained developed into mature tapeworms, and tapeworm eggs were shed in dog faeces. Humans were exposed to tapeworm eggs from dogs straying into houses and use of contaminated river water, with serious illness resulting from cyst formation in organs. The programme introduced significant changes including improved slaughtering practice hygiene by community engagement of butchers, indoor slaughterhouses, regulated slaughter waste disposal, opportunities to sell slaughter waste, improved housing in contaminated areas and conversion of riverbanks into community gardens.",
