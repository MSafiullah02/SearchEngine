            "text": "Besides medical personnel, members of the general public have been trained to perform CPR. Manual external CPR involves chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute for all age groups, at a depth of at least 5 cm in adults, and at least 1/3 of the depth of the anteroposterior chest diameter in infants and children below the age of puberty. Often a child is brought to the attention of a health-care professional or death investigator, and the etiology of injuries, in particular CPR versus inflicted blunt force trauma, becomes a crucial issue. Perpetrators may claim that injuries were caused by CPR, either by themselves or by emergency personnel. It is important to understand those injuries known to be secondary to CPR in order to better identify and classify inflicted injuries of child maltreatment.",

            "text": "\n\nRetinal Hemorrhages (RHs): Previous studies and collaborative research have concluded that CPR alone does not cause retinal hemorrhages in children with normal coagulation and platelet count (Odom et al. 1997). In patients with nontraumatic illnesses and coagulopathies, small, punctate retinal hemorrhages may be present (Odom et al. 1997). Infants found unresponsive invariably undergo resuscitative efforts, often for prolonged periods of time. Forensic pathologists must be aware that retinal hemorrhages can be seen in infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly, following cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and are not specific for abusive head trauma. Infants found unresponsive without evidence of head trauma or natural disease processes that have had CPR, especially those with restoration of circulation, can have RHs that may be few in number or numerous with extension to the ora serrata (Fig. 14.5a\u2013d) (Tatum et al. 2012).\nVisceral Injuries: Several studies report no visceral injuries to children secondary to CPR (Matshes and Lew 2010a, b; Price et al. 2000; Feldman and Brewer 1984; Cohle et al. 1995). Others report that, if present, these CPR-related injuries are not significant or life-threatening (Matshes and Lew 2010b). Abdominal visceral injury is uncommon (Price et al. 2000); however, if present, note if abdominal compressions were performed (Waldman et al. 1984).\nRib Fractures: Unlike adults, ribs in children are flexible and more resilient to fracture. In the absence of radiographic evidence of underlying bone disorder, unexplained rib fractures are indicative of abuse. Often rib fractures are associated with other signs of abuse and/or different stages of healing. However, recent studies using axial radiography have shown rib head fractures related to CPR, especially using the two-handed \u201ctwo thumbs encircling hands\u201d technique (Matshes and Lew 2010a; Reyes et al. 2011). Length of compression time does not appear to correlate with an increased chance of rib fractures. Below is a more in-depth discussion of this challenging area in differentiating rib fracture from resuscitation versus inflicted trauma.\n",

Prior to the introduction of the preferred two-handed compression technique in 2006, there were only three reported cases of resuscitation-related injuries in children (Maguire et al. 2006). Compared to an adult, the rib cage of a child has greater elasticity and plasticity due to incomplete bone development and therefore may be able to tolerate larger degrees of pressure before a fracture occurs.",

Most abusive rib fractures are believed to occur from anteroposterior compression, with the hands wrapped around the infant\u2019s chest, produced by excessive squeezing or indirectly generated by shaking. Although abusive compression can cause anterolateral rib fractures, it has been attributed to injuries of the posterior ribs near the costovertebral junction and may involve the rib head, rib neck, and posterior rib arc. The compressive force levers the posterior ribs over the transverse processes of the spine (Kleinman and Schlesinger 1997; Bulloch et al. 2000). Since one-handed CPR is typically performed with the child on a firm surface, this posterior levering should not occur.",

This is especially true with the two-handed technique, given that significant anterior compression may be produced (Matshes and Lew 2010a; Reyes et al. 2011). Resuscitation-related rib fractures are usually located either anteriorly or anterolaterally and are often multiple, linear, bilateral, or symmetrical (Fig. 14.7). These fractures usually occur near ribs 4 and 5 but have also been reported in ribs 2 through 9, the clavicle, and the sternochondral junction (Bush et al. 1996; Betz and Liebhardt 1994). If resuscitative efforts are unsuccessful, CPR-induced posterior rib fractures often have minimal associated hemorrhage and may be difficult to identify unless the parietal pleura has been reflected (Fig. 14.8).\n\n\n",

Fresh rib fractures may be missed by radiography, but can be detected at autopsy by stripping the parietal pleura from the thorax and carefully examining each rib by visual inspection and manual palpation. Often the rib fractures will be subtle, bending or buckle fractures, with little or no associated hemorrhage. Microscopic examination of resuscitation-related fractures should show no surrounding tissue reaction with minimal associated extravasated blood histologically (Dolinak 2007; Weber et al. 2009).",
