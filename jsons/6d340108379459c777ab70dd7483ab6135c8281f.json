            "text": "Asthma is characterized by abnormalities in lung function, variable airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) 1 ; among others, a significant correlation exists between the degree of AHR and both clinical severity and medication needs for asthma. 2 A number of stimuli, including respiratory viruses, are able to induce AHR. 3 Increased AHR to histamine in healthy subjects after upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) lasting up to 6 weeks was observed more than 20 years ago. 4 Human experimental infections with human rhinoviruses confirmed that increased AHR to nonspecific stimuli is observed for up to 4 weeks after a viral infection in allergic subjects. [5] [6] [7] Furthermore, AHR after viral infections has been documented in animal models of paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus infections. [8] [9] [10] Most asthma exacerbations in children are associated with URIs, attributed in their majority to rhinoviruses. 11, 12 Virus-induced AHR is increased in atopic individuals compared with in healthy control subjects. 5, 13 Moreover, atopy is one of the strongest risk factors for the development and persistence of asthma, especially in childhood. 14 More than 60% of asthmatic children are atopic, whereas the presence of atopy at the age of 12 months increases 3 to 4 times the risk for asthma persistence during later childhood and adulthood. 15, 16 There are suggestions that genes responsible for atopy and AHR act together to develop the full asthma phenotype. 17 Furthermore, it has been proposed that the defective epithelial repair cycle, which is characteristic of asthma and strongly correlates to AHR, is amplified by exposure to T H 2 cytokines. 18 Nevertheless, our current understanding of the mechanisms connecting atopy, AHR, and asthma is still incomplete. The classical model of sensitization and exposure to particular allergens 19 can only partly explain the epidemiologic observations. More recently, we and others have shown that the response of atopic asthmatic individuals to rhinovirus infection is defective, with a suboptimal T H 1 response and a shift toward a T H 2 phenotype. 20, 21 Such a response might lead to incomplete viral clearance and inflammation persistence, potentially perpetuating AHR. 22 On the basis of the above, we hypothesized that atopy could be a risk factor for prolongation of AHR after respiratory viral infections. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the duration of AHR in children with asthma after naturally occurring respiratory infections and assess the role of atopy as a risk factor in this respect.",

In our study, when the duration of AHR was assessed after a single infection, either in the subgroup of subjects who did not have additional infection for up to 11 weeks, or by means of a simple regression model, it was 7 weeks on average, ranging from 5 to 11 weeks. This time span is still longer than previously reported in human subjects (10 days to 6 weeks) 4,34 and comparable with time spans reported studies prospectively evaluating postviral AHR in experimental animals (2-22 weeks). 8, 10, 35, 36 Nevertheless, when AHR was assessed in the long term after multiple colds, a considerable proportion of atopic subjects remained hyperresponsive for considerably longer, in some cases more than 6 months. This is consistent with the notion that additional, naturally occurring colds might further prolong AHR, as recently shown in an experimental animal setting, 37 and might prove important in considering the natural history of the disease, as well as management of such patients. Therefore although our hypothesis that atopy might lead to postviral AHR prolongation was shown not to be directly true because there was no difference in AHR duration after a single infection, the total duration of AHR was in fact significantly longer in atopic than nonatopic children and that was associated with an increased number of colds, as well as asthma episodes. Patient characteristics did not differ between the groups at baseline; it cannot be excluded, however, that subclinical inflammation might have been greater in atopic subjects, which were slightly, but not significantly, more hyperresponsive at baseline.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that viral infection induces greater changes in nonspecific AHR in patients with respiratory allergy than in healthy control subjects. 5, 7, 38, 39 Accordingly, it has been assumed that after a viral infection, the response to allergen exposure might be exaggerated, a notion elegantly confirmed by using segmental bronchial provocations with allergen. 40, 41 Furthermore, clinical studies have shown synergy between viral infection and allergen exposure in sensitized individuals. 42, 43 Nevertheless, other studies have shown that allergen exposure does not necessarily augment virusmediated responses. 44, 45 This might also be the case in the atopic population of our study, who, even though they were sensitized to pollen allergens, had more symptoms during the fall and winter months rather than during the pollen season. This was not completely unexpected because all our subjects were selected for a postinfectious asthma phenotype during the 2 previous years, apparently reporting symptoms only after colds and not after allergen exposure. Certainly, the possibility that unidentified allergens might have contributed to some exacerbations cannot be completely excluded. However, the fact that the identified allergens did not seem to influence the outcome, although the number of colds and subsequent asthma exacerbations during the study was higher in atopic children, suggests that an increased susceptibility to viral infection might be a more plausible mechanism for prolongation of AHR in that group. Previous evidence suggests that the immune response to rhinovirus is defective in atopic asthmatic individuals, with reduced IFN-g production, 20, 46 which might be associated with increased susceptibility to symptomatic virus infections. In fact, rhinovirus-induced IFN-g production is strongly associated with AHR in patients with asthma. 21 There is a longstanding speculation that allergic subjects, asthmatic subjects, or both have more respiratory infections than the healthy population. 47 Most studies have compared respiratory symptoms after URI in atopic and healthy individuals. In a recent longitudinal cohort study, Corne et al 48 showed that subjects with atopic asthma are not at greater risk of a rhinovirus infection than healthy individuals but have more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms. 48 On the other hand, even within an atopic population, the outcome of an experimental rhinovirus infection is closely associated with levels of T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines. 46 It is possible that any effects of atopy on the susceptibility to respiratory viral infections might differ between adults and children, in which cytokine responses, including IFN-g responses, do not mature before late childhood. 49, 50 Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that primary epi-thelial cells derived from atopic subjects are more susceptible to ex vivo rhinovirus infection than cells from healthy control subjects. 51 A weakness of the present study is that PCR viral identification was performed only for the first reported cold and not for subsequent colds. Nevertheless, it is without doubt that respiratory viral infections are the cause of the common cold, whereas the association of colds with subsequent asthma exacerbations is also well established. 11, 12 The degree of airway responsiveness is indicative of asthma severity and counts as an indirect marker of airway inflammation. 2, 52 In this respect prolongation of virusinduced AHR might well reflect persistent airway inflammation after multiple insults. Perpetuation of subclinical airway inflammation could have a substantial effect on the risk of asthma persistence, relapse later in life, or both, providing a possible mechanism for the well-established role of atopy as a major risk factor for the persistence of asthma and AHR from childhood to adulthood. 53, 54 In conclusion, the duration of AHR in children with intermittent virus-induced asthma ranges from 5 to 11 weeks after a single infection but might be considerably prolonged with repeated infections. Atopic subjects present with more symptomatic colds and thus cumulatively have significantly more prolonged AHR. Prolongation of virus-induced AHR in atopic subjects might help explain the well-established role of atopy as a risk factor for asthma persistence.",
