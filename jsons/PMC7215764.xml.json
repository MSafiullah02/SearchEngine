ICT is growing significantly and developing rapidly and accounts for an increasingly larger part of the world of work due to its potential benefits (autonomy, flexibility, transport, and cost savings, and even as a means for epidemiological containment for certain illnesses, such as coronavirus Covid-19) [2,3,4,5]. The Third European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER 3) [6] highlights that one of the earliest and greatest impacts of digitalization is increased flexibility for workers in terms of workspace and time, which points to a significant immediate and future growth in this kind of working.",

This is not only because it makes formal and informal communication within the organization more difficult, but also seems to limit the possibilities for organizational promotion and support [24], which may give rise to disappointment, distress, and alienation [25].

Specifically, the prior studies show unfavorable differences for women in several factors, like mental overload and difficulties with work\u2013life balance [35,36,37]. These differences are associated with a variety of factors linked to the modality of online work and to responsibilities distributed according to gender roles. Working from home increases the number of hours of work [7] and blurs the boundaries between the family and the workplace. In the case of women, schedule is restructured according to family needs, which can be explained from the perspective of traditional gender roles. According to this perspective, women are, mostly, responsible for family duties, thereby generating an overload of work in both fields [38,39]. Furthermore, women must deal with high levels of stress in both domains, which frequently leads to considering the option to stop working or professional resignation [28].",

The continuous presence of the labor demands related to developing mental fatigue [17] have serious consequences for the cognitive and emotional processes of individuals, whose efficiency and performance are notably reduced [34,47]. At the same time, this aspect is related not only to the tasks, but also to the main tool of online teaching, namely the effective management of ICTs, which involves permanent training and updating of knowledge, skills, and abilities in the face of the rapid and vertiginous quantitative and qualitative changes in the technological field, in an effort to avoid techno-stress [48]. On the other hand, in the current global pandemic of Covid-19, the importance of this training and updating of online teaching strategies and tools for all educators can be appreciated at the different educational levels, in light of the mandatory cancellation of face-to-face teaching and the difficulties that this is causing for all teachers.",

This is closely related to the tasks assigned to them in accordance with traditional gender roles, which underline their greater responsibility in the family [2]. Most domestic tasks are \u201clow-control-schedule\u201d [54], which means they must be carried out despite interference, so that female teachers try to reorganize their activity around satisfying these family demands, and are forced to increase their schedules thanks to the possibilities of ICTs or, alternatively, reduce family time [38], as noted above. This eventually leads to work overload and high levels of stress, which are enhanced by the blurred boundaries between work and family, resulting from online education, work spikes, and time pressure linked to short and strict deadlines, all of which make it more difficult to reconcile the two fields.",

Consequently, it seems important to discover to what extent workers perceive the definition of their role, the goals they must meet, the activities they must do, and how those activities are scheduled, as well as the evaluation system.

Those researchers warn of the risks derived from turning telecommuting into an abstract activity mediated by a computer; in other words, turning it into a dehumanized activity that can eventually cause a significant degradation of social skills for interacting adaptively with others. Since it is usually women who tend to take advantage of teleworking [1], this lack of social recognition mainly affects them and is linked to the lack of approval of non-domestic work for which they are considered to be the main person responsible. In this sense, Casta\u00f1o [63] states that teleworking may contribute to making women\u2019s work invisible, as it is now completely developed in the personal area. Finally, and in agreement with Pocock [64], it is understood that identifying the reasons why these psychosocial risk factors and the consequences associated with mimicry affect women online teachers more than men (generating higher levels of stress), requires a global approach focused on exploring the interrelations between multiple work, technological, social, and individual factors, which will be the subject of further research.",
