            "text": "Interdiffusion, which occurs in the presence of chemical potential gradient and results in net transport of mass, is an omnipresent but important phenomenon in a variety of materials processes, e.g., solidification, solid solution, aging, corrosion, mutual interaction between coatings and matrix, and so on [1\u20136]. Accurate interdiffusion coefficients (or interdiffusivities) are necessary for comprehensive understanding of these materials processes that helps to improve the property and performance of the target materials [7\u20139]. Moreover, accurate interdiffusion coefficients are also important parameters encountered in numerous equations of physics and chemistry [10, 11], and different types of numerical simulations based on Fick\u2019s law for quantitative characterization of various physical, chemical and materials processes [12\u201319]. In general, the interdiffusion coefficient, also known as the chemical diffusion coefficient, is composition- and temperature-dependent. In a binary system, there is only one unique type of interdiffusion coefficient, while in a ternary system, a 2 \u00d7 2 interdiffusivity matrix (two main and two cross interdiffusivities) exists. As the component number increases, the size of such interdiffusion matrix increases dramatically, not to mention that they are composition- and temperature-dependent. Accordingly, it is really a challenge for efficient storage and usage of interdiffusivity matrix of composition and temperature dependence in industrial materials that are typically multicomponent [14, 15].",

The atomic mobilities are represented by its underlying physical/mathematic models [20\u201324], and the related model parameters can be assessed on the basis of the experimental diffusivity data phase by phase in the framework of the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) technique [25] and stored in the atomic mobility database phase by phase [26\u201328]. From atomic mobility database together with the consistent thermodynamic database, one can calculate interdiffusivities of the corresponding system at any compositions and temperatures. The key point for establishment of accurate atomic mobility database for the target materials is attributed to the large amount of high-quality experimental diffusion coefficients, especially for the ones due to their efficient determination, in individual phase. However, to acquire large amount of high-quality interdiffusion coefficients, especially in multicomponent systems, is still very challenging.",

For metallic solids, the solid-state single-phase diffusion couple technique is widely used to determine the interdiffusion coefficients. The intuitive demonstration of the preparation of solid/solid diffusion couple and the basic procedure for evaluation of interdiffusion coefficients are presented in Fig. 1. For more detailed information on the diffusion couple technique, one can refer to some nice publications [29\u201332]. Ideally, the standard diffusion couple technique in combination with the electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and some other advanced techniques [30] can result in high-quality experimental composition profiles (note: they are actually a series of scattering data points). However, one should bear in mind that (1) the effect of grain boundary diffusion should be eliminated. One can either utilize the single-crystal samples or employ the long enough homogenization period and/or high enough homogenization temperature to let the grains grow large enough (i.e., at least longer than the diffusion distance during the subsequent annealing stage of diffusion couple) for polycrystal samples and (2) the effect of preparation methods for diffusion couple on the composition profiles at the initial state should be also considered. This is a very tricky task. A typical treatment is to have a relatively long annealing period to ease the effect of the initial composition profiles on the finally evaluated interdiffusion coefficients. Moreover, another superior treatment is from the very recent work by Chen et al. [32], who included the initial composition profiles as the initial state in the numerical inverse method. With the measured high-quality composition profiles, two more preconditions should be fulfilled in order to further determine the high-quality interdiffusion coefficients, i.e., the reasonable computational method for the evaluation of interdiffusion coefficient and that for the quantification of uncertainties.",

            "text": "Currently, the computational methods widely used for calculating interdiffusion coefficient in the literature can be divided into two categories. The first category includes the Boltzmann\u2013Matano [33] and other related methods [34\u201340]. However, it is very difficult to apply the traditional Matano-based methods to evaluate the interdiffusion coefficients in quaternary and higher-order systems. Recently, some efforts have been made to extend their applicable capability, for instance, the pseudo-binary and pseudo-ternary methods developed by Paul and his colleagues [39\u201341]. One more important point related to the computational methods is that the adopted fitting function for the composition profile entails the influence on the obtained results. Considering the diversity of the experimental composition profiles, there are a variety of options for the fitting functions [42\u201347]. Even for one set of composition profiles, different fitting functions may lead to different interdiffusion coefficients [48]. Thus, it is of general interest to find a common function for all types of composition profiles in diffusion community. The second category refers to the numerical inverse methods [49\u201354], of which the essence is to solve an inverse problem. To take the experimental composition profiles as the result of a functional of interdiffusion coefficient matrices, such a functional is inversely determined by minimizing the misfit between the model-predicted and experimental composition profiles [55]. The advantage of the numerical inverse method rests with its computational efficiency and general applicability in systems with any number of components, but the accuracy for the interdiffusivities obtained from the numerical inverse method strongly depends on the numerical algorithms and convergence, which attracts the recent research interests.",

It also fits well with the aims of the popular Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) projects nowadays [59\u201361]. The \u201chigh-throughput\u201d determination should be achieved in both experimental and computational aspects. In the experimental aspect, the usage of advanced diffusion multiple technique [62], which is an assembly of numbers of subdiffusion couples, can provide relatively much more experimental composition data at once, compared with the single diffusion couple. As for the computational aspect, the numerical inverse method, which can retrieve the composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusion coefficients along the entire diffusion path of diffusion multiple/couple, may realize this goal [54].",

Latest developments of different methods are highlighted in the respective sections. Thereafter, several typical application cases with the features of high efficiency and high quality in determination of interdiffusion coefficients in Ni-based superalloys, face-centered cubic (fcc) high-entropy alloys and newly developed fcc AlCoCrFeNiTi high-entropy superalloys are demonstrated in \u201cCase studies on high-throughput determination of interdiffusion coefficients\u201d section. Discussion on the related diffusion properties, including the possible substitution of Re in Ni-based single-crystal superalloys and the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy/high-entropy superalloys, is also carried out. In \u201cUncertainty quantification for high-quality interdiffusion coefficients\u201d section, summary and highlights on quantifying the uncertainties of the interdiffusion coefficients evaluated using the two categories of calculation methods are speculatively laid out. Finally, the conclusions of this review are drawn. Furthermore, the future development directions related to the high-throughput determination of high-quality interdiffusion coefficients in metallic solids are also pointed out.",

Thus, for a ternary system, there are four independent unknowns, but only two equations [i.e., Eqs. (5) and (6)] for one diffusion couple. For determining the interdiffusivity matrix in the ternary system, Kirkaldy and Young [34] extended the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method to the ternary systems by carefully designing two diffusion couples of which diffusion paths have at least one common intersection point, as schematically shown as, for example, Points S1 and/or S2 in Fig. 2. At the common intersection point, one can have another two equations like Eqs. (5) and (6). Then, the four unknowns in the ternary interdiffusivity matrix can be explicitly solved. If the interdiffusion fluxes in Eqs. (5) and (6) are solved by the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method [i.e., Eqs. (2) and (3)], one can refer it to be the Matano\u2013Kirkaldy method [34]. However, if those are solved by the Sauer\u2013Freise method, one can refer it to be the Whittle\u2013Green method [63]. Though either the Matano\u2013Kirkaldy or the Whittle\u2013Green method has been widely used to determine the interdiffusion coefficients in ternary systems for the past years [45, 46, 64\u201373], there are two major constraints for this type of methods. One suffers from their low efficiency because only one set of interdiffusivity matrices at one intersection point can be obtained for two diffusion couples. For the sake of the composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients in a ternary system, a large number of diffusion couples should be designed and prepared. However, the other constraint is owing to the difficulty in applying these types of methods in quaternary and higher-order systems since it seems impossible to design the diffusion couples with a common intersection in quaternary and higher-order systems.",

            "text": "In order to overcome the dilemma, some efforts have been made to extend the applicability of the traditional Matano-based methods. The first successful trial was from Dayananda and Sohn [35] in 1999, who proposed one approach for evaluating the average interdiffusion coefficients over specifically selected distance/composition ranges along the diffusion path of a single diffusion couple. One code, namely MultiDiFlux, was accordingly developed by Dayananda and his colleagues [74]. With the Daynanada\u2013Sohn method, the amount of diffusion couples can be largely decreased, and the computational efficiency increases. However, only limited average interdiffusion coefficients can be determined, and their reliability depends largely on its variation within the specified composition range, which limits the wide application of the Daynanada\u2013Sohn method. For the purpose of determining the composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients in a ternary system using a single diffusion couple, Cermak and Rothova [75] extended the Daynanada\u2013Sohn method [35] by making the distance/composition interval sufficiently small. With a sufficiently small interval, the authors [75] claimed that the average interdiffusion coefficients can approach the truly composition-dependent values with an arbitrary required accuracy. However, Cheng et al. [76] mathematically verified that the interdiffusivities evaluated by the Cermak\u2013Rothova method [75] are still the average ones, but not the truly composition-dependent values. Another important contribution to the extension of Matano-based methods is from Morral and his colleagues [38, 77, 78], who introduced the concept of the square root diffusivity, and its relation to the interdiffusion coefficient in ternary and higher-order systems. However, according to such square root method, the composition interval over the diffusion couple should be small enough, and the resultant interdiffusion coefficients are constant. Similar to the average interdiffusion coefficient, the evaluated constant interdiffusion coefficients limit the wide applicability of the square root method considering its low efficiency.",

Their diffusion paths of the three varying components projecting over an isothermal section (like P2 and P3 in Fig. 2) should have at least one common intersection point, similar to the one in ternary systems, i.e., S1, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The compositions of the three varying components should be modified following the similar strategy as in the pseudo-binary method, and the modified composition profiles of the three components are then fitted separately [40]. One more additional step in the pseudo-ternary method is required to take the average value of the composition profiles of all the components with constant composition [41]. With the modified compositions, the interdiffusion fluxes for the solute components in the pseudo-ternary systems can be thus calculated according to Eq. (7). Meanwhile, the two equations similar to Eqs. (5) and (6) can be deduced based on the modified compositions as [40],8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\tilde{J}_{{\\text{A}}} = - \\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{AA}}}}^{{\\text{C}}} \\frac{{{\\text{d}}M_{{\\text{A}}} }}{{{\\text{d}}x}} - \\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{AB}}}}^{{\\text{C}}} \\frac{{{\\text{d}}M_{{\\text{B}}} }}{{{\\text{d}}x}} $$\\end{document}J~A=-D~AACdMAdx-D~ABCdMBdx9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\tilde{J}_{{\\text{B}}} = - \\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{BA}}}}^{{\\text{C}}} \\frac{{{\\text{d}}M_{{\\text{A}}} }}{{{\\text{d}}x}} - \\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{BB}}}}^{{\\text{C}}} \\frac{{{\\text{d}}M_{{\\text{B}}} }}{{{\\text{d}}x}} $$\\end{document}J~B=-D~BACdMAdx-D~BBCdMBdx\nfor one pseudo-ternary diffusion couple. Here, A, B and C are the components with varying compositions alongside the diffusion region of the fictitious A\u2013B\u2013C pseudo-ternary systems. After that, the standard Whittle\u2013Green method can be utilized to compute the interdiffusion coefficients at the common intersection point of every two pseudo-ternary diffusion couples. A demonstration of the pseudo-ternary method in a real case from Esakkiraja et al. [41] is presented in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the measured composition profiles and their diffusion paths of the ternary Co\u2013Fe\u2013Ni and pseudo-ternary Co\u2013Fe\u2013Ni(Mo) diffusion couples annealed at 1100 \u00b0C for 100 h are displayed. The interdiffusion coefficient matrices of the ternary Ni\u2013Co\u2013Fe system and the pseudo-ternary Ni\u2013Co\u2013Fe (Mo) system at the corresponding intersection points along the diffusion paths can be then calculated [41]. The recently developed pseudo-binary and pseudo-ternary methods act as the important extension of the traditional Matano-based methods and can be employed to evaluate the interdiffusion coefficients in quaternary and higher-order systems, e.g., the high-entropy alloys [40, 41]. However, one should bear in mind that the strict pseudo-binary and/or pseudo-ternary diffusion couples need to be carefully designed if the pseudo-binary and/or pseudo-ternary methods are to be used. Moreover, according to the recent comment by Belova and Murch [83], one should be careful about the difference between the interdiffusion coefficients evaluated using the pseudo-binary/-ternary method and the actual ones, especially in multicomponent systems.",

The advantages of these functions lie in the convenience of implementation, though they are considered to be prone to over-fitting [48]. One example was given by Zhong et al. [54], in which the interdiffusion coefficients of fcc Cu\u2013Sn alloys at 873 K were evaluated using the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method based on the same composition profile but fitted with different fitting functions, including the single, double and triple Boltzmann functions, as presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the experimental composition profile due to Xu et al. [86] can be well reproduced by different fitting functions. However, different fitting functions may lead to different fitting degrees, resulting in the interdiffusion coefficients with noticeable difference. A single Boltzmann function tends to produce the average interdiffusion coefficient, while the superposition of the Boltzmann function generally produces the complicated relation between the interdiffusion coefficient and composition.",

The numerical inverse method falls into the category of inverse problem or inverse coefficient problem. In fact, the inverse problem, as a well-studied topic in mathematics, is about reasoning the causes from the observations [87\u201390]. With the initial state of a diffusion couple and the composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients, the predictions to the composition profiles of a diffusion couple can be imitated or simulated, namely the forward problem. In practice, the diffusion couple or diffusion multiple method together with the composition measurement techniques (like EPMA) provides the observations of the composition profiles. The inverse methods basically perform the reasoning of the coefficients in the governing equations by adapting the coefficients of interest to produce the predictions, which should agree satisfactorily with the observations, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The inverse problem can be generally cast into the framework of the PDE-constrained optimization problem,10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\theta  = \\arg \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{\\theta } \\sum\\limits_{l} {\\left\\| {\\tilde{c}_{l}  - c_{l} \\left( \\theta  \\right) } \\right\\|} _{2}^{2} $$\\end{document}\u03b8=argmin\u03b8\u2211lc~l-cl\u03b822",

            "text": "In 2002, Bouchet and Mevrel [49, 91] applied the numerical inverse method to evaluate the interdiffusion coefficients in ternary systems. In their work, the polynomial equation was employed to model the relation of the interdiffusion coefficients with the composition [49]. Moreover, Bouchet and Mevrel\u2019s work is featured with its treatment to solve the diffusion equations of a ternary system, following the convention proposed by Fujita and Gosting [92] on usage of the Boltzmann\u2019s similarity variable. Fujita and Gosting\u2019s convention can give an exact solution of the equations for free diffusion in three-component systems [92] and provide incredible convenience for making predictions to the composition profiles, assuming that the volume change on mixing and the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficients are negligible. However, it is well known that for most practical systems, the interdiffusion coefficients are generally considered as composition dependent. To overcome such a constraint, Bouchet and Mevrel converted the partial differential equations of the Fick\u2019s second law for a ternary system into the ordinary differential equations and made predictions to the composition profiles based on the reformulated equations [49]. With the predictions, the genetic algorithm was adopted by Bouchet and Mevrel for reasoning the coefficients of preset polynomial equation related to the interdiffusion coefficients so as to mimic the experimental composition profiles with the satisfactory fitting goodness. As claimed by Bouchet and Mevrel [49], a quite strict convergence criterion was applied though the finally obtained predictions deviate against the originally imitated composition profiles to a certain degree.",

Such forward simulation method also falls to the category of numerical inverse method, as processes of this method accord with the essence of inverse problem. Different from the general inverse problems related to the Fick\u2019s laws, the forward simulation method cooperates with the internal solver for the moving boundary problem or sharp interface model for the predictions of the composition profiles in the reactive diffusion couples/multiples. Accordingly, an open-source package, implemented with Python language, for the forward simulation method was also released in 2019 [94]. Though the forward simulation is advanced in calculating the interdiffusion coefficients for single phase or multiple phases in the diffusion couples/multiples, it is currently limited to the binary systems [51, 93\u201396]. It is worth mentioning that the diffusion multiple technique has been frequently adopted in Zhao\u2019s group [95, 96] to provide the possibility for high-throughput determination of interdiffusion coefficients in the single/multiple phases of the diffusion multiples. One typical application in Ni\u2013Mo system from Zhao\u2019s group [94] is displayed in Fig. 8. It can be seen from the figure that based on the experimental composition profiles in one Ni/Mo reactive diffusion couple annealed at 1100 \u00b0C for 800 h, the composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients of different phases in the Ni\u2013Mo system at 1100 \u00b0C evaluated from the forward simulation method are in good agreement with those derived from the Sauer\u2013Freise method.",

In the pragmatic numerical inverse method, the composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusion coefficients are related to the atomic mobilities, which are expressed in the CALPHAD-type formalism [20], following the conventional Manning\u2019s equation [97, 98]. The real CALPHAD thermodynamic descriptions may be used for providing the thermodynamic factor, which can promote the evaluation of the physical atomic mobilities. However, whether the realistic CALPHAD thermodynamic descriptions are used or not does not affect the accuracy of the obtained interdiffusion coefficients. In favor of robotizing the procedures to retrieve the reliable composition-dependent interdiffusivities from the experimental composition profiles of single or multiple diffusion couples, a free-accessible C++ code for High-throughput Determination of Interdiffusion Coefficients (HitDIC) [54] was developed based on the pragmatic numerical inverse method and released worldwide in 2017 through the Web site: https://hitdic.com/. For the past years, the pragmatic numerical inverse method (using HitDIC) has been widely applied in different series of alloys with any number of components [99\u2013102] and will be specifically introduced in the \u201cPragmatic numerical inverse method and HitDIC software\u201d section.",

The CALPHAD-type thermodynamic descriptions were employed by Kucza et al. [50, 103] for the sake of evaluating derivatives of the chemical potential with respect to composition. But in many cases that no CALHAD thermodynamic descriptions are available in the literature, the authors [103] utilized the Miedema model [104, 105] to provide the thermodynamic parameters, which should be not so accurate as those from the CALPHAD assessment. For the kinetic part, Kucza et al. [50, 103] introduced a coefficient matrix of which the parameters characterize the diffusion interactions among the components of the target system. The tracer diffusivities were then roughly approximated by the linear dependence on the evaluated coefficient matrix, of which the terms were assumed as constants [50, 103]. What\u2019s more, a program based on the Mathcad platform was also developed by the authors [50, 103]. It should be noted that this method was only used by Kucza et al. [50, 103] to evaluate the tracer diffusivities, instead of the interdiffusion coefficients. Moreover, the accuracy of their obtained tracer diffusivities strongly depends on the quality of thermodynamic descriptions.",

In their numerical inverse method, both the experimental tracer and chemical diffusion concentration profiles were employed to retrieve the parameters in pairwise mobilities. It is worth mentioning that with the tracer diffusion experiments, the quality of the obtained tracer diffusivities/mobilities can be ensured. Thus, the method from Gaertner et al. [106] is superior to the one proposed by Kucza et al. [50, 103]. But again, no interdiffusion coefficients were predicted by Gaertner et al. [106]. Moreover, the meticulous details on the modeling of the inverse processes, which is very important for the reliability of the assessed parameters to be shown in \u201cPragmatic numerical inverse method and HitDIC software\u201d section, were also absent in Ref.

The default values of the weights, i.e., wi, are set to be 1, and they can be customized according to the importance and reliability of the experimental properties. Scaling is generally in need as the magnitude of deviation contributed from the different experimental sources is remarkable, while wx and wJ are responsible for rescaling different types of experimental properties. Consideration of multiple optimization criteria falls to the multiobjective problem, which can be also resolved with the readily proposed PDE-constrained optimization framework, providing profound stability and uniqueness for the desired computation results. One nice example is demonstrated in Fig. 9, in which the model-predicted composition profiles and interdiffusion fluxes of solute B in a hypothetical A\u20130.01B/A\u20130.99B (in mole fraction) binary diffusion couple, annealed at a certain temperature for 7200 s, based on five different sets of binary interdiffusivities, are presented. It can be inferred from Fig. 9 that the interdiffusion fluxes, being more sensitive to the fitting goodness than the composition profiles, are then suggested as one of the promising alternatives as the optimization criteria [53].",

In 2017, the HitDIC software for the high-throughput determination of interdiffusion coefficients was released, which fully demonstrates the powerful capability of the numerical inverse method to reason the interdiffusion coefficients of multicomponent systems [54]. Figure 10 presents the computational framework of HitDIC. As indicated in Fig. 10, the composition profiles of all the diffusion couples are handled by the observation module, while the thermodynamic and atomic mobility databases are utilized by the simulation module. Computation of the deviations between the observations and predictions generated by observation and simulation module, respectively, is processed by the error module, producing overall metric of fitting goodness. Minimization process is executed under the optimization module to pursue satisfactory values of the parameters of interest in the atomic mobility database, which minimizes the cost function provided by the error module. Once the values of the parameters of interest are determined, the interdiffusion coefficients with respect to the composition can be further evaluated according to Eqs. (13)\u2013(16). Briefly, HitDIC program is designed to execute over the readily made project by users; meanwhile, usage and demonstration of the HitDIC software are also available in https://hitdic.com.",

A profound evidence of the equivalence of the two methods, i.e., numerical inverse method and Boltzmann\u2013Matano method, is from Xu et al. [99]. As illustrated in Fig. 11, based on the same sets of experimental composition profiles, the interdiffusion coefficients of fcc Ag\u2013In binary alloys at 873 K, 973 K and 1073 K were calculated by using both the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method with distribution functions and the numerical inverse method with HitDIC. As can be seen in the figure, very good agreement between the interdiffusion coefficients evaluated using the two methods is obtained, indicating that the accuracy of the interdiffusion coefficients evaluated by means of the numerical inverse method can be guaranteed. Moreover, similar conclusion can be drawn in ternary systems, as demonstrated in Fig. 12. The interdiffusion coefficients of fcc Ag\u2013In\u2013Cu alloys at 1073 K are evaluated based on the same sets of experimental composition profiles using both the Matano\u2013Kirkaldy method with distribution functions and the numerical inverse method with HitDIC and compared with each other in Fig. 12. Again, very good consistency in the main and cross interdiffusion coefficients of fcc Ag\u2013In\u2013Cu alloys evaluated using the two methods can be clearly seen.",

Inverse problems are typically ill-posed, and the deduced reason, i.e., the desired interdiffusion coefficients for the Fick\u2019s second law, is sensitive to the variation in the original dataset, i.e., the experimental composition profiles, or having multiple feasible solutions. Such an essence of being ill-posed cannot be generally resolved using the advanced optimization algorithms which are insufficient to sort out the \u201cbest\u201d from the equivalent ones. However, enriching the diffusion information for inverse problem, e.g., increasing the number of diffusion couples being concerned and/or adopting interdiffusion fluxes as addition optimization criterion, does help reduce the severity of being ill-posed or limit the possible solutions. When sufficient diffusion couples are supplied, numerical inverse method is able to come up with interdiffusion coefficients which are independent with level of noises contained by the experimental data [53, 54].",

            "text": "Beyond enriching experimental data, one convention adopted frequently in the community of inverse problem is to apply prior assumptions to restrict the solutions [89], like the parameter selection and regularization. Taking the numerical inverse method proposed by Chen et al. [52] as an example, the model for \u201catomic mobility\u201d parameters is subject to a nested model, i.e., Eq. (16). Following the CALPHAD convention, it is assumed that the less interaction parameters are utilized that the better generality of the assessed values of the interaction parameters. The problem arises as it is hard to balance between the extrapolation and explanatory capability of the proposed models. The criteria regarding both the objectives, e.g., information criteria [113], are therefore required to weigh between the fitting goodness and the number of effective parameters for the sake of joint parameter selection and parameter estimation. The satisfactory solution is further obtained by resolving the reformulated optimization problem with a proposed criterion as the surrogated objective. The regularization is generally served as another tool for preventing overfitting while improving the generality of the assessed model and estimated parameters [114, 115]. The generality is of special importance for CALPHAD modeling, which always emphasizes the parameters of lower order systems for extrapolating and predicting the states and properties of higher order ones. Similar to the parameter selection, a surrogated objective function is formulated by introducing penalty on L1/L2 norm to the original objective function.",

The creep deformation behavior of Ni-based single-crystal superalloys controls the service life of turbine blades [117], which significantly benefits from the alloying effect due to the complex constitution of superalloy. According to the empirical and/or semiempirical relations proposed in Refs.[117\u2013120], the interdiffusion coefficients of solutes are one of the key factors determining the creep resistance of the Ni-based superalloys. For the purpose of optimizing and even improving the creep properties of Ni-based superalloys, accurate determination of interdiffusion coefficients in Ni-based superalloys is invaluable and indispensable. For the past decades, extensive researches have been devoted to this direction. The readers can refer to the very recent summary of the current status of the interdiffusion databank in the Ni-based superalloy by Zhang et al. [31] for detailed information. Here, only a demonstration on how to perform the high-throughput determination of interdiffusion coefficients in Ni-based superalloys, as well as some meaningful results, is given as follows.",

Taking fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr system by Chen and Zhang [121] as an example, a fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr diffusion multiple was carefully prepared by means of the hot-pressing technique and subject to annealing at 1173 K for 180 h. The backscattered electron (BSE) image for the microstructure of the fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr diffusion multiple is demonstrated in Fig. 13. As can be seen, with single/multiple ensemble, one set of binary Ni\u2013Cr composition profiles and four sets of ternary Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr composition profiles at 1173 K can be harvested, as shown in Fig. 14. In the calculation procedure, the advantages of using atomic mobility parameters with physical meaning as the fitting parameters in the pragmatic numerical inverse method were applied to evaluate the composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficient matrix surface in Ni-rich fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr systems at 1173 K, as displayed in Fig. 15. The validation of the obtained interdiffusion coefficients can be verified by the consistency between the model-predicted composition profiles in the diffusion multiple and the experimental ones. Moreover, it should be noted that all the measured composition profiles in ternary Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr system were addressed simultaneously in the same optimization process, resulting in one self-consistent set of atomic mobilities for fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Cr phase at 1173 K. Such self-consistent set of atomic mobilities together with the thermodynamic descriptions can be used to predict the reasonable interdiffusion coefficients over much wider composition range.",

[8, 110, 122, 123] performed a series of experimental measurements of interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni\u2013X and Ni\u2013Al\u2013X alloys (X = Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir or Pt) to discover potential substitutional elements for Re in the new-generation single-crystal Ni-based superalloys. For binary systems, the diffusion couple technique in combination with the Matano-based methods was employed to determine the composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni\u2013X systems. As for the ternary systems, multiple diffusion couples together with HitDIC software in the framework of pragmatic numerical inverse method were utilized to conduct the high-throughput measurement of composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusivity matrices in fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013X systems. The reliability of the determined interdiffusivities was validated by comprehensively comparing the model-predicted profiles of composition or interdiffusion flux for each diffusion couple with the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, the comparison with the interdiffusivities evaluated using the traditional Matano\u2013Kirkaldy method as well as those from the literature and in boundary binary systems was conducted. Reliable interdiffusion coefficients over the concerned composition ranges were therefore obtained. The typical results of fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Re and Ni\u2013Al\u2013Os systems are presented in Fig. 16, in which the three-dimensional main interdiffusivity surfaces, i.e., \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{AlAl}}}}^{{{\\text{Ni}}}}$$\\end{document}D~AlAlNi, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{ReRe}}}}^{{{\\text{Ni}}}}$$\\end{document}D~ReReNi in fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Re system, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{AlAl}}}}^{{{\\text{Ni}}}}$$\\end{document}D~AlAlNi, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tilde{D}_{{{\\text{OsOs}}}}^{{{\\text{Ni}}}}$$\\end{document}D~OsOsNi in fcc Ni\u2013Al-Os system, at 1473 K, 1523 K and 1573 K, are included. From such 3D interdiffusivity surfaces, one can clearly see the change in the main interdiffusivities with the compositions of solutes, and also temperature. A comprehensive comparison of the evaluated interdiffusion coefficients in binary fcc Ni\u2013X and ternary fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013X alloys is illustrated in Fig. 17. As can be seen, in binary systems, the diffusion rate of Os is always lower than that of Re over the investigated temperature range i.e., from 1473 to 1573 K, while in ternary systems, the diffusion rate of Re is lower than that of Os at 1473 K and 1523 K but is slightly higher at 1573 K. Thus, in terms of diffusion coefficients, it was highly proposed that Os might be the potential substitute for Re in the new-generation Ni-based single-crystal superalloys [8], which triggers the subsequent extensive studies on the Ni-based superalloys with element Os [124, 125].",

            "text": "The high-entropy alloys, or multiprinciple element alloys, which open a new door for exploring the novel alloys, are gaining more and more attention in materials community nowadays. It was reported that the sluggish diffusion is responsible for endowing the high-entropy alloys with outstanding properties at high temperatures, e.g., mechanical, magnetic and electrochemical characteristics [126]. In 2003, Tsai et al. [127] performed the first measurement of diffusivities in fcc CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys by using the quasi-binary diffusion couples together with the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method, and their results supported the core effect of sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys. However, Paul [128] commented on the method used by Tsai et al. [127] and questioned their derived diffusion data. Thus, whether the sluggish diffusion exists in the high-entropy alloys is still in question. In order to reveal the nature of diffusion behaviors in high-entropy alloys, it is necessary to perform large amount of accurate measurement of diffusivities in high-entropy alloys, as one of the research hot spots in the materials community [8, 9, 102, 103, 127, 129\u2013133]. All the related literature reports up to now can be divided into two categories. The major one contributes to the determination of interdiffusion coefficients in fcc high-entropy alloys [8, 9, 102, 103, 127, 129\u2013133], while the minor one contributes to the measurement of tracer diffusion coefficients in high-entropy alloys [134\u2013136].",

The typical results in fcc CoCrFeMnNi and CoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys are presented in Figs. 18 and 19, respectively. Chen et al. [129] prepared a CoCrFeMnNi diffusion multiple schematically displayed in Fig. 18a using the hot-pressing technique. After annealing at 1373 K for 120 h, four groups of composition profiles in fcc CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys were measured from such a diffusion multiple using EPMA technique. The corresponding quinary main interdiffusivities in the Co\u2013Cr\u2013Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ni HEAs at 1373 K are determined by the pragmatic numerical inverse method and shown in Fig. 18b. As for fcc CoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys, a simplified sandwich-type diffusion multiple, schematically displayed in Fig. 19a, was employed by Wang et al. [101]. In total, three such sandwich diffusion multiples were prepared and subjected to annealing at 1273, 1323 and 1373 K for 72 h. The typical results of the composition profiles, interdiffusion fluxes and interdiffusion coefficients are presented in Fig. 19b.",

[129], as shown in Fig. 20. In terms of the interdiffusion coefficients, it can be found that the binary interdiffusivities are larger than the ternary ones and are much larger than the ones for quinary systems. When it comes to the tracer diffusion coefficients, the tracer diffusivities of Ni in quinary alloys are lower than the data in binary alloys but larger than the values in ternary and quaternary alloys. Thus, it was concluded that the sluggish diffusion characteristic of Co\u2013Cr\u2013Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ni HEAs exists from the point of view of interdiffusion coefficients, rather than the tracer diffusion coefficients [129]. Moreover, a similar conclusion was also drawn by Wang et al. [101] for the fcc Co\u2013Cr\u2013Cu\u2013Fe\u2013Ni HEAs.",

[137] reported a novel superalloy, i.e., AlCoCrFeNiTi-based high-entropy superalloy (HESA), which owns the composition space in between the traditional Ni-based superalloys and HEAs. HESAs were found to possess comprehensive mechanical properties attributed to their similar microstructure to the conventional Ni-based superalloys (i.e., fcc-\u03b3 and L12-\u03b3\u2032 precipitates) in combination with the similar properties to the traditional high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Meanwhile, with few or even no refractory elements, HESAs are with much lower density as well as lower cost than the traditional superalloys. In order to further validate whether such novel HESAs can be a candidate for substituting the traditional Ni-based superalloys, the creep resistance, which was reported to be related to diffusivities in the \u03b3 matrix [138], is one key factor. Thus, there is also a need to measure the accurate interdiffusion coefficients in the fcc AlCoCrFeNiTi alloys.",

            "text": "Up to now, only several reports about quantifying uncertainties of the interdiffusion coefficients in binary systems have been covered [55, 56]. In 2007, Ben Abdellah et al. [55] made a first attempt to quantify the uncertainty of interdiffusion coefficients in binary system evaluated using the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method. However, Ben Abdellah et al. [55] considered the error sourced from the measurement of composition to be constant. Moreover, uncertainty propagation through the fitting procedure was not taken into account, as well as the uncertainty sourced from the determination of the Matano plane. Later, Lechelle et al. [56] advanced the uncertainty of interdiffusion coefficients in the framework of the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method considering both fitting and experimental errors together with their propagation in the evaluation of interdiffusion coefficients. But the fitting function for composition profiles is prescribed by Lechelle et al. [56], and thus derived parameters and relation to the uncertainties are not generalized with other fitting functions, e.g., distribution functions. As a broad generalization, such reports generally calculate interdiffusion coefficients based on Boltzmann\u2013Matano method and its variances and quantified the uncertainty from the frequentist point of view. The uncertainty propagated from sources to the results is measured by means of the mathematical relations between the sources of uncertainty and the interdiffusion coefficients, while quantifying the quantity of uncertainties together with the derivatives of mathematical relations. Another alternative for quantifying the uncertainty of various computation processes can be fulfilled from the point of view of Bayesian inference. Boettinger et al. [57] performed the analysis of uncertainty differently by using the Gaussian process to simulate the effect of the noises on the calculated interdiffusion coefficients, belonging to the category of Bayesian inference. New efforts on quantifying the uncertainties among the interdiffusion coefficients from the point of view of frequentist and Bayesian inference [145] are subsequently summarized as follows.",

Knowledge of uncertainty of the Matano position is considerable, which is to be resolved for the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method. Confidence interval for the slopes and interdiffusion fluxes can also be calculated according to the formalism of error propagation, as illustrated in Fig. 22b, c. It is worthy of mentioning that the estimated confidence intervals due to the two different approaches for the evaluation of the interdiffusion fluxes distinguish from each other, as shown in Fig. 22c. Thus, the distinguishable difference among the confidence interval of the interdiffusion fluxes is finally inherited by the evaluated confidence interval for the interdiffusion coefficients, shown in Fig. 22d. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 22d that the evaluated interdiffusion coefficients using the Boltzmann\u2013Matano and Sauer\u2013Freise methods are exactly the same and consistent with the true values, which locate well in the confidence intervals of the evaluated interdiffusion coefficients using the two methods.",

[58] in order to draw the posterior distributions of the \u201catomic mobility\u201d parameters, i.e., in the fcc Ni\u2013Al\u2013Ta alloy, as shown in Fig. 25. Generally, the \u201catomic mobility\u201d parameters with the determined uncertainties can be applied for profiling the uncertainty of the interdiffusion coefficients, together with the thermodynamic descriptions. As a fact that \u201catomic mobility\u201d is more favorable of being stored in the kinetic database, such a backward propagation process is not intended to be demonstrated in the current context. Nevertheless, Bayesian inference is able to come up with the probability density proportional to a known function, to which the explicit relation and derivatives with respect to the concerned parameters are not the prerequisite. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, i.e., Metropolis\u2013Hasting algorithm, usually converges slowly. Sufficient iterations for random walks, i.e., 10000 for problem with three parameters of interest, are demanded to offer a good representation of the target posterior distribution. Therefore, the convergence diagnostics is helpful in preventing the unexpected waste of computing resources and time, as well as offering convincing evidence for the assessed values and uncertainty for the parameters of interest.",

It can be finally concluded that the recent fascinating progress makes the high-throughput determination of high-quality interdiffusion coefficients in metallic solids feasible now. Moreover, the reliable high-throughput computational methods/tools and the resultant high-quality interdiffusivity databank, together with the diffusion multiple technique for high-throughput measurement, generally constitute the solid infrastructures of the MGI [59, 60], ICME [154], and even machine learning projects for novel materials design.

The fact that datasets for diffusion properties are sparse in the high-dimension composition space is urging on advanced techniques beyond intuitive understanding the potential effects on the materials performance.
