Although the Geneva Protocol (which has been ratified, acceded to, or succeeded to by 137 State Parties as of March 15, 201332) banned the use of biological weapons, it did not proscribe the research, production, or possession of biological weapons, and many of the State Parties to the treaty reserved the right to retaliate in kind should they or their allies be attacked. In addition, no provision was made for verification and compliance was voluntary. A number of countries agreeing to the Geneva Protocol began or continued biological weapons programs after becoming treaty signatories. These included Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.17 The United States did not ratify the Geneva Protocol until 1975 after it had ended its biological weapons program.25\n",

It consisted of a major center in Pingfan, Manchuria, termed Unit 731 with more than 3000 scientists plus smaller units at a number of other sites in China. Another center (Unit 100) worked primarily with animal and plant diseases, including glanders, sheep and cattle plague, red rust, and mosaic plant diseases. More than 10,000 prisoners died as a result of experimental infections or execution after experimentation.25, 33 At least 11 cities in China were attacked during World War II using, variously, anthrax, cholera, Shigella, Salmonella, and plague organisms to contaminate food and water supplies. For example, fleas were infected with plague bacteria and released by aircraft over cities. Data regarding the success of Japan's efforts to infect civilian populations is sketchy. Large outbreaks of cholera and plague are known to have occurred, but it is believed that transmission in any given area was not long sustained. The extent and sophistication of the Japanese program came to be known after the war when Japanese scientists were offered amnesty from war crimes prosecution for the information provided. This information served as an impetus for the expansion of biological weapons programs in a number of countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Canada.",

In conjunction with these activities, medical countermeasures were developed, including vaccines and antibiotics, to protect scientists and military personnel; technical advances were made that permitted large-scale fermentation and storage of agents. Studies of animal responses to infection were conducted at Fort Detrick, in atolls in the Pacific, and at desert sites in the United States. Experiments using aerosolized simulant organisms were conducted in a number of cities to study survival time of organisms and patterns of dispersal.34\n",

Accordingly, verifying adherence to and compliance with the BWC by State Parties has proven challenging. For example, the Soviet Union became a State Party to the BWC in 1975. However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s serious concerns arose regarding the biological weapons capability of the Soviet Union.17 Through defectors, it was learned that the Soviet Union maintained a biological weapons program that was far more extensive and sophisticated than any had imagined at the end of the Cold War.38, 39, 40 After the establishment of the BWC in 1972, the Soviet Union created a civilian research program called Biopreparat to conduct\u2014under the guise of legitimate research\u2014offensive biological weapons\u2013related research not permitted under the BWC. The program included a system of 18 research laboratories and centers employing up to approximately 60,000 staff at its height. One of the larger and more sophisticated of its facilities, the Vector State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, referred to as VECTOR, was a 4000-person, 30-building complex with high-security biological facilities for laboratories and isolation of human cases. It was at VECTOR where, during the 1980s, the technical problems were solved for the large-scale production of smallpox virus intended to be used as an offensive weapon.",

After the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) in 1991, U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 established, among other things, the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) to carry out on-site inspections of Iraq's biological, chemical, and missile capabilities and to oversee their destruction, removal, or procedures to render them harmless.46 In April 1991 under its initial declaration (as required under U.N. Resolution 687), Iraq declared that it did not have a biological weapons program and in August 1991 declared to the first biological weapons inspection team only that it had conducted \u201cbiological research activities for defensive military purposes.\u201d47 It was not until July 1995, after 4 years of UNSCOM investigations and \u201cin the light of irrefutable evidence\u201d that Iraq admitted for the first time that it had an offensive biological weapons program.47 However, Iraq initially denied weaponization. It took a defector to begin to uncover the full extent of the Iraqi program. In August 1995 General Hussein Kamel, who had responsibility for all of Iraq's weapons programs, defected to Jordan and began cooperating with UNSCOM. Subsequently, Iraq admitted to \u201ca far more extensive biological warfare programme\u201d than previously admitted including weaponization.\u201d47\n U.N.

A notable case occurred in September 1984, when members of a religious cult, the Rajneeshees, deliberately contaminated salad bars located along a stretch of an Oregon interstate highway with Salmonella typhimurium (now Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi). Although there were no deaths among the 751 persons who became ill, 45 were hospitalized.49 The public health investigation of this incident initially failed to determine how the salad bars became contaminated. It was not until 1 year after the outbreak that dissension among the perpetrators led law enforcement officials to discover the contamination was deliberate with the ultimate goal of disrupting a local election.2 This episode illustrates the difficulty in differentiating an ordinary foodborne outbreak from a small-scale biological weapons attack conducted by non\u2013state actors.",

Determining how to focus limited resources is a key to such efforts. Two critical elements are used to assess and estimate which biological organisms are of greatest concern: threat assessment and risk assessment. Threat assessment is the process of assessing the likelihood that a particular intentional hazard will occur by estimating potential adversaries' capabilities and intentions.55 This is a particularly difficult task with respect to biological weapons. Potential adversaries pursuing a biological weapons capability encompass a diffuse set of state and non\u2013state entities (e.g., terrorist groups, criminal networks, individuals), which are difficult to identify and gather information on.56 To achieve a tactical and strategic advantage, potential adversaries strive to maintain secrecy, making it difficult to gain insight into their specific intentions and capabilities. In addition, it is extremely difficult to differentiate biological weapons research and development from legitimate research and development efforts. These factors make it difficult to develop threat assessments that are accurate and actionable. In addition, the biological weapons threat continually evolves as a result of advances in science and technology and as a result of adversaries adjusting their strategies and tactics in response to a nation's perceived vulnerabilities. Accordingly, there are substantial difficulties in identifying potential aggressors, let alone estimating their intentions and capabilities.",

Ideally, early identification of a biological attack could come from sensitive and specific pattern recognition of illnesses or a surveillance system for identification of environmental pathogens. However, an effective system does not currently exist. This means that early detection of a biological attack will primarily rely on front-line clinicians and laboratorians. In the United States, federal, state, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as many health care systems, have taken steps to improve surveillance capabilities to detect unusual biological outbreaks and cases. And in recent years, improved surveillance systems at the international, national, and local levels\u2014including an improved network of public health laboratories\u2014have enabled the detection of outbreaks of novel infectious diseases with an exceedingly small number of cases.72 Despite these improvements, it is still highly likely that the first identification of a biological attack will be the diagnosis of patients by an astute clinician. Clinically suspect cases require prompt laboratory confirmation, which is an essential step for any public health response. Thus, through a variety of educational approaches and training programs, emphasis has been placed on assuring that clinicians, particularly emergency medicine and infectious disease specialists, are knowledgeable of biological agents of greatest concern, know of the importance of prompt reporting to public health officials, and have access to laboratories that are prepared to provide rapid disease diagnosis.",

The effects of the latter are readily apparent, allowing early approximations to be made as to the geographic extent of the problem and the number and nature of casualties to be expected. Needed response efforts can thus be gauged and initiated immediately. For biological weapons, however, the incubation period of biological agents means there is an inherent delay from the time a covert attack is launched until the realization that an attack has occurred\u2014most likely by the identification of sick patients. The varying incubation periods of the disease inevitably mean a delay in gauging the magnitude and scope of the attack and deploying appropriate response efforts on the basis of the epidemiology of the ensuing outbreak. However, the epidemiology of a disease outbreak from a biological attack can differ greatly from a natural disease outbreak, which can complicate event investigation and response efforts. For example, simultaneous attacks with an aerosolized biological agent in several locations could generate a large, complex geographic distribution of cases complicating efforts to develop an epidemic curve. In addition, exposure to a large inoculum of aerosolized biological agents could result in atypical disease presentations and clinical courses (e.g., shorter incubation periods, compressed and severe disease course). Furthermore, on the basis of experiences after the anthrax attacks, it is to be expected that there will be widespread apprehension, fear, and concern about the possibility of further cases\u2014either from the spread of a contagious agent and/or from sequential attacks. Many may live in fear that they or their families will be the next victims. Experience shows that this inevitably complicates event investigation and response efforts.8, 9, 74, 75 For example, in the 2001 anthrax attack it was not until more than 2 weeks after the initial anthrax-laden letters were sent through the U.S. Postal Service that the index case was diagnosed and reported.7, 76 By that time nine cases of anthrax had actually occurred (two inhalational and seven cutaneous). As health and law enforcement authorities subsequently worked to determine what had happened and to implement appropriate response measures, additional anthrax-laden letters were sent (3 weeks after the initial letters), resulting in an additional 13 cases of anthrax (nine inhalational and four cutaneous).",

Reviews of past epidemics indicate that the most essential factor is effective leadership and competent, frequent, and open communication with the public, the press, professionals, and others concerned in dealing with the epidemic. This is an area that is too often neglected. The 2001 anthrax outbreak illustrated the problems resulting from inadequate lines of communication.83 Health departments at all levels were overwhelmed by requests for information from the public, from health professionals, and especially from the media. None had experienced an epidemic threat such as this, and none were prepared. Frequent, authoritative, up-to-date reports through the media to the public proved absolutely vital, but it took time before a pattern for these became established. The need for communication between and among professionals was clear, and this is now being addressed in part by the national Health Alert Network, which is financed by federal preparedness funds.84 It was also apparent that command centers were required to coordinate and direct operations and to facilitate the flow of information, but these took time to become established and to begin to function well. Sophisticated centers are now in place in the Secretary's Office at HHS, the CDC, and in many states and cities; they are now staffed on a 24-hour-per-day, 7-day-per-week schedule. Information and education materials have been prepared with respect to Category A diseases and are available throughout the health system.

This was the case in all countries that reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Experience has shown that quarantine measures are seldom effective and, in fact, often lead to more serious problems as many seek to flee an area or deny the presence of possible cases in family or friends, thus precluding appropriate containment measures.85\n",

It defines a tiered system of laboratories for the identification and verification of biological agents. At the base of the network are approximately 25,000 sentinel laboratories composed of hospital and commercial diagnostic laboratories. These form the base of the network providing routine diagnostic services and ruling out the presence of biological threat agents in Biosafety Level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 environments. The American Society of Microbiology works closely with the CDC and sentinel laboratories to provide needed protocols and training for laboratorians. The sentinel laboratories refer questionable samples to the second tier of approximately 150 reference laboratories that function as high as BSL-3 for further identification and investigation. This tier includes state and local public health, military, veterinary, agriculture, food, and water testing laboratories. Additionally, certain countries, such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and South Korea, have their own reference laboratories. Final confirmation of a threat agent is done at national laboratories capable of functioning at BSL-4 if needed. These laboratories have capabilities to conduct specialized strain characterization and bioforensics and are found at the CDC, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and Naval Medical Research Center.",

In 2005 the system was expanded to increase outdoor air sampling in each city and to add indoor facility monitoring. The estimated 10-year cost of the current system is $0.6 billion with an annualized cost of $80 million. A proposed expansion of the program to include more cities with more detection devices per city would increase the annualized cost to $200 million.95 Although the system has not reported any false-positive results, it has had several \u201cBioWatch Actionable Results\u201d due to detection of airborne, naturally occurring DNA in the environment. Such identification, if declared before further information was known, could have caused considerable public concern.

Routine smallpox vaccination had stopped in 1972 coincident with progress in the smallpox eradication program and a decreasing risk of importation of the disease. Only 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine remained in storage. It had been produced in 1978. This amount was woefully insufficient to cope with epidemic smallpox should the virus be released. The old vaccine had been a crude preparation produced on the skin of calves and would not meet the standards of a contemporary vaccine. After the 1980 declaration that smallpox had been eradicated, vaccination stopped everywhere and all production facilities were dismantled or converted to other uses. It was estimated then that 5 to 8 years would be required, after traditional vaccine development protocols, to develop, produce, and license a new vaccine, grown, as are contemporary vaccines, in tissue cell culture. The pathway from discovery through development, production, and final FDA approval of a new product is costly, as well as time consuming, with a price tag estimated to be between $800 million and $1.2 billion.104\n",
