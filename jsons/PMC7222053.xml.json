Survivorship research places an emphasis on optimizing physiological, psychosocial, and functional outcomes for cancer survivors and their families [4] such as the well-documented treatment-related side effects; pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reductions in aerobic capacity; and deleterious alterations in body composition [5, 6].",

Survivors and their supporters can attend a weekend long health education and behavior retreat to improve the likelihood of change and maintenance in health behavior in a supportive community of other people with cancer. During the weekend, attendees can participate in guided hikes, yoga, classes on nutrition, physical activity, stress, sleep management techniques, and facilitated workshops on behavior change and habit formation. All programming is evidence based, taught by experts in the area, and based on the theory of behavior change. Retreats are an opportunity for survivors and their supporters to take the time to rest, reflect, and refocus on their health while providing the ability to connect with other survivors to increase their social support.",

We therefore utilized a single group pre- and post-test study design that aimed to evaluate attendance at a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat on health-related quality of life, physical activity, and psychosocial health 3 months post-retreat in cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the educational workshops, social support, and goal-setting workshop would improve quality of life, physical activity, and the associated psychosocial domains. The aim of this study is to evaluate Knights Cabin Cancer retreats on the quality of life, physical activity, and psychosocial health of participants at a 3-month follow-up. This evaluation will improve Knights Cabin programming and provide future direction for Knights Cabin research.",

The multidimensional focus of Knights Cabin programming is based around the health behavior components that are rooted in evidence regarding their impact on cancer survivor health in either a physical or psychosocial domain in addition to counseling on adherence to the behavior. The retreat begins with an introduction to behavior change using the theory of planned behavior due to its extensive research with cancer survivors [9]. Over the course of a weekend retreat, cancer survivors and their supporters are engaged in education on physical activity and nutrition, sleep hygiene, mindfulness workshops, stress management, and participate in activities such as yoga and hiking. All activities are done as a group with survivors and their supporters following a detailed schedule that factors in time for both educational and participatory events as well as leisure time, time blocks for educational components, and participatory events average 90 min (Table 1). All education provided is based on current evidence-based guidelines in the field of oncology and presented by volunteers with expertise in the area such as yoga instructors, certified exercise physiologists, dieticians, and sleep experts. At the end of the retreat, cancer survivors engage in a goal-setting workshop focusing on health habit change based on influencing different constructs of the theory of planned behavior such as social support or physical activity enjoyment. Individuals primarily chose to plan their health behavior changes around physical activity due to the emphasis placed on the importance of physical activity in cancer survivorship.",

Self-esteem was assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [29] which has a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 and test-retest of 0.88 and a construct validity of 0.46 to 0.71 [30]. Depression was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale [31]. In an evaluation with a cancer population, the CES-D had a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.89 and a test-retest score of 0.57. The correlations between the CES-D and other depressive assessments were between 0.65 and 0.77 [32].",

The low response rate and missing data is a weakness of this analysis as we were only able to make pre-post comparisons on the 51 participants who completed follow-up questionnaires. One of the reasons for low response rate may be due to not providing sufficient email reminders regarding questionnaire completion. Three email reminders were added in at later retreats which dramatically improved completion rates. In addition, confidentiality was achieved by having individuals use initials only when completing baseline and follow-up questionnaires; however, due to inconsistency in the initials, there was further loss of data due to an inability to match data. Additionally, it should be noted that there were no corrections for multiple comparisons in analysis due to the small sample size. Other potential limitations of this pilot work are a lack of data to provide evidence regarding other health changes that may have occurred between attending a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat and the time of completing a follow-up questionnaire. For instance, participant feedback suggests that there may have been some additional health challenges, such as cancer reoccurrence, which occurred during this 3-month follow-up that could have affected program impact; however, this was not captured. Lastly, there is no comparative control group, and therefore, we are unable to know whether the changes observed would have occurred independent of attending a retreat.",
