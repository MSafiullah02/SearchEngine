A Fpat7_ motif of 41-PGKK(N/S)KK has previously been identified in the N protein as the functional nuclear localization signal (NLS); however, the biological consequences of N protein nuclear localization are unknown. In the present study, the role of N protein nuclear localization during infection was investigated in pigs using an NLS-null mutant virus. When two lysines at 43 and 44 at the NLS locus were substituted to glycines, the modified NLS with 41-PGGGNKK restricted the N protein to the cytoplasm. This NLS-null mutation was introduced into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV. Upon transfection of cells, the NLS-null full-length clone induced cytopathic effects and produced infectious progeny. The NLS-null virus grew to a titer 100-fold lower than that of wildtype virus. To examine the response to NLS-null PRRSV in the natural host, three groups of pigs, consisting of seven animals per group, were intranasally inoculated with wild-type, placebo, or NLS-null virus, and the animals were maintained for 4 weeks. The NLS-null-infected pigs had a significantly shorter mean duration of viremia than wild-type-infected pigs but developed significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Mutations occurred at the NLS locus in one pig during viremia, and four types of mutations were identified: 41-PGRGNKK, 41-PGGRNKK, and 41-PGRRNKK, and 41-PGKKSKK. Both wild-type and NLS-null viruses persisted in the tonsils for at least 4 weeks, and the NLS-null virus persisting in the tonsils was found to be mutated to either 41-PGRGNKK or 41-PGGRNKK in all pigs. No other mutation was found in the N gene. All types of reversions which occurred during viremia and persistence were able to translocate the mutated N proteins to the nucleus, indicating a strong selection pressure for reversion at the NLS locus of the N protein in vivo. Reversions from NLS-null to functional NLS in the tonsils suggest a possible correlation of viral persistence with N protein nuclear localization. These results show that N protein nuclear localization is non-essential for PRRSV multiplication but may play an important role in viral attenuation and in pathogenesis in vivo.

Soon after, PRRS virus (PRRSV) was isolated as the causative agent for the disease in the USA and in The Netherlands (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . PRRSV has quickly become endemic in nearly all pig-producing countries and is now considered one of the most economically important pathogens of swine worldwide. PRRSV grows preferentially in porcine alveolar macrophages and establishes a persistent infection of up to 5 months in infected pigs (Allende et al., 2000; Wills et al., 1997) .

In our study, seroconversion was detectable by 10 days post-infection in all virus-infected pigs, but virus neutralizing antibody titers were significantly higher in P129-GG infected pigs by 3 weeks postinfection. A typical immune response to PRRSV in pigs is characterized by early production of non-neutralizing antibodies followed by the delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies between 2 and 4 weeks post-infection, which then persist at low levels. Moreover, typical titers of serum neutralizing antibodies are between 2 and 12, titers which are considered unusually low in comparison with those induced by viruses of other families (Labarque et al., 2000; Loemba et al., 1996) .

Shedding of virus from persistently infected animals is a main factor which makes the control of PRRS difficult in the field (Allende et al., 2000; Wills et al., 1997) . The mechanism of PRRS virus persistence is unknown. During persistence, structural genes are generally variable, with the exception of the N gene which is considered genetically stable (Allende et al., 2000) . The genetic stability of the N gene has also been observed for EAV during persistence in stallions (Hedges et al., 1999) . It is interesting to note that the EAV N protein also specifically localizes to the nucleus upon infection (Tijms et al., 2002) . In the present study, both wild-type and P129-GG viruses persisted at least for 1 month in the tonsils of pigs. Surprisingly, all P129-GG viruses isolated from the tonsils of infected pigs harbored mutations at the NLS locus. In all cases, one or two nucleotide changes occurred, and these changes led to amino acid alterations from glycine to arginine at position 43 or 44 of N. The preferential mutation to arginine is explained by the fact that a single nucleotide change from FG_ to FA_ will code for arginine, whereas two nucleotide changes are required to code for lysine. No silent mutations were found in more than 18 plaques examined. The arginine mutation at position 43 or 44 reverted the NLS-null virus to a functional phenotype. Indeed, the N proteins containing an arginine mutation at 43 or 44 were all found to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus. The observation that 41-PGRGNKK was positive for NLS function was unexpected, since it deviates from the ''pat7'' motif definition of a proline followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues (K or R) out of four (Rowland et al., 1999 . In order to accommodate all functional sequences, the NLS motif of North American genotype PRRSV N proteins is herein expanded and redefined as a ''pat8'' motif: a proline followed within three residues by a segment containing at least three basic residues (K or R) out of five. The corresponding sequences in isolates VR-2332 and P129 are 41-PGKKNKKK and 41-PGKKSKKK, respectively. The most common functional NLS revertant found in tonsils during the present study, 41-PGRGNKKK, conforms to the pat8 (but not the pat7) pattern. A review of sequences in Genbank reveals that nearly all North American PRRSV isolates conform to the pat7 motif, but there are three exceptions. Genbank accession numbers AF043951, AY209228, AY262352 describe field isolates with NLS sequences of 41-PGKNNKKK, 41-PGKKNMKR, and 41-PGKKNNKR, respectively. The pat8 motif encompasses these and all other known North American PRRSV N protein sequences (over 70 at the time of this analysis).
