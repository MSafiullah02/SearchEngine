            "text": "Coronavirus belongs to the family of coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. There are four groups of coronaviruses (Zhu & Zhang, 2020): alphacoronaviruses infect mammals (human coronavirus NL63), Betacoronaviruses infect mammals (SARS CoV, MERS CoV, Bat CoV), gammacoronaviruses infect birds (avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus), deltacoronaviruses infect both birds and mammals (porcein delta CoV). Four viruses 229 E (alpha), UC 43 (beta), NL 63 (alpha), and HKU1 (beta) cause common cold symptoms. COVID\u201019 is a betacoronavirus (Zhu & Zhang, 2020). Bat coronavirus HKU4 is also a betacoronavirus. It is a large (27\u201332 kb), enveloped, positive\u2010stranded RNA virus. Its viral genome is packed inside a helical capsid formed by nucleocapsid protein and is surrounded by an envelope. The virus has four proteins: membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), spike protein (S), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Spike forms large protrusions on viral surface, giving it a crownlike appearance, and hence the name corona. Spike protein mediates the entry of the virus into host cells (Lellan & Wrapp, 2020). It is also the critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and is a major inducer of host immune response (Li, 2016). Spike protein is in charge of receptor binding and subsequent viral entry into the host cells. Therefore, it can be the major therapeutic target. It binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) or CD 26. The former is more for SARS and the latter is for MERS. CD 209 L is the alternative receptor with lower affinity to respiratory tract (Song et al., 2019).",

Their structural analysis predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus uses ACE2 as its host receptor. They have further stated that a single mutation significantly enhances the ability of nCoV (Wuhan) to bind with human ACE2 (Zhu & Zhang, 2020).",

Lopinavir and ritonavir, which are protease inhibitors, and oseltamivir neuraminidase are under study. Remdesivir, which interferes with viral polymerase, can be tried (it has shown efficacy against MERS) (Wan et al., 2020).Vaccine trials need to be started. Antibodies raised against the S1 subunit can be protective, so can antibodies against the RBD fragment. Spike protein\u2010based vaccine will also produce antibodies and will offer protection. Passive antibody transfer from convalescent sera of recovered patients will have polyclonal antibodies, and their plasma can be transfused. A new idea of target viral receptor protein on cell surface ACE2 and RBD protein can be attached to an Fc fragment and can be used to attack the virus. Extracellular domain of ACE2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin G, Fc domain may hold promise (David Fedson, 2016). ACE2 Fc fusion protein against COVID may neutralize the virus and prevent lung injury. It can also be used to give passive immunity to health care workers. All these are still highly experimental. An interesting paper (Hoffmann et al., 2020) mentions the use of a drug called CAMOSTAT acting on TMPRSS 2 protein, which could prevent viral entry as the virus uses the protein.Based on the structure of the virus, the presence of ACE2 as the receptor, which facilitates entry of the virus, and based on work done in SARS, ARDS, and sepsis by Fedson (2016), some treatments can be hypothesized. A large body of experimental and clinical research done on treating patients with pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, influenza, and Ebola (with lung injury) suggest that statins and angiotensin receptor blockers might be effective in COVID\u201019 infection. Statins are known to have lipid\u2010lowering and also anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities on cytokines, chemokines, complement cascade, and coagulation factors. Thus, the host response to COVID\u201019 resulting in lung injury may be controlled with the use of statins. Hypercytokinemia is not directly associated with viral replication, but it can be variability in host response. Early use of statins could prove beneficial. Other anti\u2010inflammatory drugs can be used. Chloroquine is being tried too.We also hypothesize that the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) available for clinical use as antihypertensives can be potential drugs to be given for control of viral spread of novel coronavirus (Wuhan) infection. An unpublished observation by one of us (M.P.) is that people using losartan or telmisartan (ARB) as antihypertensives get fewer attacks of cold and flu\u2010like illnesses. Both these drugs also do not produce cough as the side effect so commonly seen with ACE inhibitors. Losartan and telmisartan strongly binds to the AT1 receptors more than valsartan (Phadke & Saunik, 2020). Therefore, the use of the former could be suitable in the treatment of coronavirus disease. The mode of administration in addition to being given orally could be in the form of a nasal spray. Published literature is scant on this information. Clinicians and scientists may consider the use of losartan or telmisartan in therapeutic doses for preventing the virus entering the host cell and spread of infection. Rapid clinical trials are the need of the hour. In mice, experimentally infected with H5N1 influenza, treatment with ARB (Losartan) improved survival (Kruse, 2020).\n",

Thus, the use of ARB (telmisartan and losartan) to be given in therapeutic doses along with zinc to control viral replication warrants attention. ACE2 receptors are widely expressed on epithelial cells of alveoli, trancheobronchial free and may help virus entry (Song et al., 2019). Therefore, the use of ARBs in the form of nebulization can be tried.",
