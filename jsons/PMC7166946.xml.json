            "text": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a wide variety of different etiologic agents among viruses and bacteria. With increasing availability of specific and sensitive diagnostic assays using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), it has become clear that the etiological diagnosis based on signs and symptoms is unreliable, since the clinical presentation of different causative agents is often similar, especially in immunocompromised patients [Ison, 2012; Hirsch et al., 2013]. Of note, this limitation also applies to periods of higher pretest probability as during epidemics, as reported previously [Dumoulin et al., 2009; Grondahl et al., 2014]. Therefore, rapid and correct identification of RTI agents is important for infection control and treatment strategies. Although near\u2010patient testing is available and particularly important for treating influenza [Khanna et al., 2009; Beckmann and Hirsch, 2015], negative results are not satisfactory, especially for immunocompromised patients [Ison, 2012; Hirsch et al., 2013]. This challenge is most conveniently tackled by NAT for multiple pathogens in parallel. Multiplex NAT platforms are able to detect different viruses and bacteria in a single assay, but are often technically demanding in preparation, processing, and read\u2010outs, which increase the hands\u2010on\u2010time (HOT) and affect the turn\u2010around\u2010time (TAT) [Caliendo, 2011]. In 2009, we routinely introduced the RespiFinder platform [Reijans et al., 2008] to identify respiratory pathogens in symptomatic children and adults [Dumoulin et al., 2009; Nickel et al., 2009; Sidler et al., 2012], which detects 22 different pathogens using a multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification (MLPA) coupled to capillary electrophoresis (RF\u201022). However, the procedure is demanding with considerable HOT and the current TAT of 8\u201316 hr is limiting its clinical utility, especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Therefore, we compared the RF\u201022 with the NxTAG\u2010respiratory pathogen panel (NxTAG\u2010RPP), which combines a multiplex RT\u2010PCR with bead hybridization for detection and identification of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria associated with virus\u2010like RTI.",

MFI values above the threshold for a particular pathogen indicated a detectable target (positive result). The limit of detection was target dependent and indicated by the manufacturer. RF\u201022 served as the primary reference test. Discordant results led to re\u2010testing using local in\u2010house quantitative PCRs (QNAT).

In this study, we present the direct comparison of our current routine assay, the RespiFinder\u201022\u00ae (RF\u201022) with the novel NxTAG\u2010RPP for RTI specimens from symptomatic adults and children. The overall concordance between both assay results was high with 263 (93.3%) samples and an overall positivity rate of more than 50%. The leading pathogens were rhino\u2010/enterovirus, parainfluenzavirus, influenzavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (Fig. 1B). The pathogen\u2010specific results were highly concordant for parainfluenzavirus\u20101, \u20102, \u20104, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H3), influenza A (H1N1), influenza B, human coronaviruses 229E and HKU1, and Legionella pneumophila (\u03ba\u2010value 1.0) (Table IIA), whereas adenovirus, rhino\u2010/enterovirus, human bocavirus, para\u2010influenzavirus\u20103, and human coronaviruses OC43 had slightly lower \u03ba\u2010values of \u22650.9. The most striking differences were observed for human coronaviruses NL63 (\u03ba\u2010value 0.83) and M. pneumonia (\u03ba\u2010value 0.80), which is still interpreted as an almost perfect agreement though the positivity rate was too low to draw conclusions. All discordant results that were verified by QNAT were associated with high cycle threshold (CT) values, indicating low genome loads (data not shown). The detection of additional rhino\u2010/enterovirus was the single most important cause for discordance and seems to result from a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG\u2010RPP compared to RF\u201022. Clearly, the role of rhino\u2010/enterovirus detection, particularly in dual infections, requires additional studies as pointed out recently [Milano et al., 2010; Piralla et al., 2014]. NxTAG\u2010RPP suffered from occasionally invalid results due to a low bead count, which disappeared with more hands\u2010on experience of the technicians. Failure of the RF\u201022 with invalid internal controls or other technical issues were seen in less than 2%, and required repeat testing. The specimen types consisted mostly of nasopharyngeal swabs, but BAL was submitted in one fourth of the cases, which requires an invasive procedure typically applied to patients with significant clinical problems. Of note, no difference was seen in the rates of discordant results in BAL (5/76; 6.6%) versus NPA (14/199; 7.0%).",

While CE marking has been obtained in the meantime, costs cannot be addressed at present. However, the ease of handling and HOT were clearly in favor of the novel NxTAG\u2010RPP. This is largely due to the lyophilized master mix in the sealed ready\u2010to\u2010use microtiter plates, and the bead technology, including PCR and hybridization in one step, which reduces the HOT to less than 30 min.
