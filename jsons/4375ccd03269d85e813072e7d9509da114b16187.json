Based on in vitro data, CHOICES (CHlorOquine and Imatinib Combination to Eliminate Stem cells) was an international, randomised phase II trial designed to study the safety and efficacy of imatinib (IM) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) compared with IM alone in CP-CML patients in major cytogenetic remission with residual disease detectable by qPCR. Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to either arm. Treatment 'successes' was the primary end point, defined as \u22650.5 log reduction in 12-month qPCR level from trial entry. Selected secondary study end points were 24-month treatment 'successes', molecular response and progression at 12 and 24 months, comparison of IM levels, and achievement of blood HCQ levels >2000 ng/ml. At 12 months, there was no difference in 'success' rate (p = 0.58); MMR was achieved in 80% (IM) vs 92% (IM/HCQ) (p = 0.21). At 24 months, the 'success' rate was 20.8% higher with IM/HCQ (p = 0.059). No patients progressed. Seventeen serious adverse events, including four serious adverse reactions, were reported; diarrhoea occurred more frequently with combination. IM/HCQ is tolerable in CP-CML, with modest improvement in qPCR levels at 12 and 24 months, suggesting autophagy inhibition maybe of clinical value in CP-CML.",

Upregulation of BCR-ABL drives disordered myelopoiesis through aberrant metabolism and expression of downstream signalling pathways [3, 4] . Despite a targeted therapeutic approach, disease persistence is driven by a small residual BCR-ABL1 positive (+) stem cell population [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . This can lead to disease progression to the more acute form, termed blast crisis, which carries a very poor prognosis [10] . Measures to enhance the elimination of residual disease are therefore required to further improve outcomes and increase the number of patients obtaining deep molecular remission (DMR; defined as \u22654-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels) who can be considered for discontinuation of TKI treatment and long-lasting treatment-free remission (TFR) [11] [12] [13] .",

HCQ plasma levels were aiming to achieve a trough concentration of >2000 ng/ml at the time points described above. Only 47.1% (n = 8/17) achieved this trough HCQ plasma concentration at any time point during the 12 months of IM/HCQ treatment. There was no correlation Success' rates were determined by \u22650.5 log reduction in BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio between arms. Patients who withdrew before assessment or who had an increase in dose prior to assessment were classified as 'failures'. Complete molecular response (CMR) was defined as undetectable BCR-ABL1 in the presence of at least 10,000 ABL1 control transcripts. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined a BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio consistently \u22640.1% IM imatinib, IM/HCQ imatinib and hydroxychloroquine between the likelihood of achieving treatment 'success' and achieving this trough HCQ concentration (Fig. S1B) . Autophagy inhibition was additionally determined ex vivo using the lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B-II) levels as a marker of autophagosomes. Bone marrow and PB samples were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months (Table S2 ). In line with recent findings demonstrating increased autophagy flow in primitive CML cells [23] , the number of LC3B-II puncta was significantly increased in BM-derived CD34+ samples, when compared with PB mononuclear cells (p = 0.002) (Fig. S2A ). LC3B-II puncta were often undetectable in PB and, as expected, ex vivo HCQ treatment was required to determine LC3B-II expression (Fig. S2B) . We demonstrated no linear correlation with trough IM/HCQ levels and degree of LC3B-II levels (data not shown). We did not demonstrate a reduction in colony-forming cell or long-term culture-initiating cell potentiation with IM/HCQ compared with IM alone (Fig. S2C, D) .",

Furthermore, the incidence of progression to blast crisis under TKI treatment ranges between 0.7 and 4.5% per annum [25] [26] [27] . One mechanism postulated to contribute to this lack of TKI response is the phenomenon of disease persistence, which suggests that despite a targeted therapeutic approach, BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms are being exploited to sustain the survival of CML LSCs [5, 28, 29] . Autophagy has emerged as a critical factor in resistance to a number of chemotherapeutic agents and is an attractive approach in targeting CP-CML LSCs [15, 16] . In CML, reports suggest that BCR-ABL is a negative regulator of autophagy, with autophagy being induced following in vitro TKI treatment, and in vitro pharmacological autophagy inhibition enhances the effect of TKI on functionally defined CML stem cells [15, 30] . Other studies have demonstrated that BCR-ABL promotes autophagosome formation and that autophagy is essential for BCR-ABL-dependent leukemogenesis [31, 32] , suggesting that BCR-ABL may affect autophagy differently during malignant transformation and progression, as has been suggested in other malignancies [33] . Together, this suggests that combination treatment with TKI and autophagy inhibition may lead to higher rates Fig. 3 Butterfly plots illustrating the prevalence of selected haematology and biochemistry toxicities and adverse events during the first 12 months of treatment and during follow-up.

However, it is well documented that in CML patients with an IM-induced complete cytogenetic response, a minimum of a half-log increase in BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio (including loss of MMR) is a significant risk factor for future loss of complete cytogenetic response [34] . It was, therefore, felt that a reduction of this magnitude would be clinically significant. There was no statistical difference in 'success' rates between IM and IM/HCQ arms at 12 months. However, there was an increasing trend towards MMR in the IM/ HCQ arm, and the number of 'successes' was 20.8% higher with IM/HCQ at 24 months (one-sided p = 0.059 two-sided p = 0.090).",

This is particularly relevant in view of the kinetic response that exists during TKI therapy, with a steeper slope and 'faster' kinetics noted until MMR is achieved. At trial entry, 47.2% and 31.3% of patients were not in MMR in IM and IM/HCQ arms, respectively. As stated above, however, combination treatment demonstrated a higher proportion of treatment 'successes', which is therefore likely to represent clinical significance. To evaluate this further, in a post hoc analysis, we demonstrated that those patients with 'high' expression of BCR-ABL1 (defined as >0.0305%, as based on the median level at trial entry) in the combination treatment arm were more likely to achieve both treatment 'success' and DMR at 12 and 24 months, suggesting that further research into autophagy inhibition in combination with TKI is warranted in those patients not achieving optimal treatment milestones on TKI alone.",

This is intriguing as patients at 24 months were no longer taking combination treatment, suggesting that the effect of autophagy inhibition was long-lasting. We could hypothesise that this is due to alterations in the quiescent phenotype of the CML LSC leading to greater TKI response with prolonged use. This is similar to other trials targeting CML-LSCs where deeper and significant BCR-ABL1 transcript response was seen on prolonged follow-up (5 years) [35] . However, we did not establish autophagy inhibition in in vitro assays at 12 or 24 months, and in future work in this field, perhaps extending ex vivo assays to later time points, as well as including alternative cellular mechanisms, such as senescence, could be considered to more clearly define the changes in the functional properties of CML stem cells as a result of prolonged treatment of patients with autophagy inhibitors and continuing subsequent therapies.",

There are increasing barriers in recruitment to CP-CML studies. Firstly, this is generally a 'well' population, who tolerates TKI treatment, has few follow-up appointments, and is challenged with a low rate of progression. Clinical trials in CP-CML confer increased hospital attendance, with more procedures, including bone marrow aspirates that are psychologically unappealing. However, as demonstrated by the frequent molecular recurrence seen in patients attempting TFR [11, 12, 36, 37] , there is an unmet clinical need to develop therapies capable of targeting the CML LSC which is believed to be the cause of molecular recurrence, and enable more patients to obtain DMR and successfully maintain TFR.",

Diarrhoea and fatigue were the main reasons for dose reduction of HCQ, both recognised adverse effects [39, 42] . Interestingly, compared with IM alone, no patients developed musculoskeletal AEs with IM/HCQ compared with 8/ 29 on IM, in keeping with its known clinical utility in rheumatological disorders [43] . To our surprise, 4/29 patients developed hyponatraemia with IM alone. Although not identified as a significant toxicity in the IRIS clinical trial (NCT00006343) [44] , hyponatraemia is recognised as an uncommon adverse event (>1:1000 to <1:100) of imatinib therapy [45] .",

Plasma levels of HCQ were taken to determine therapeutic dosing, with target trough levels >2000 ng/ml. However, very recently published in vitro data from our group indicates that even if this was accomplished, at this trough concentration (equivalent to 5.9 \u00b5M) complete autophagy inhibition may not be achieved [23] . These data were not available when the trial was conducted. Furthermore, consistent HCQ plasma concentrations were not achieved within our trial population and large interpatient variability in HCQ levels has been demonstrated in a recent clinical trial, in combination with everolimus, in renal cell cancer [38] . Together, this perhaps explains the lack of correlation with in vitro assessment; an issue that has been previously demonstrated within solid tumours [46] [47] [48] . A major drawback to HCQ dose optimisation and ultimate achievement of autophagy inhibition is the risk of adverse effects when using higher doses for longer durations, particularly retinopathy [39, 49] . Retinopathy is unlikely to occur with dosages less than 6.5 mg/kg/day within the first 10 years of therapy [40] ; we demonstrated no cases of retinopathy.",

Our study suggests that clinically achievable doses of HCQ are unlikely to achieve a sufficient trough plasma concentration to accomplish meaningful autophagy inhibition.
