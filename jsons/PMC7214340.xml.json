This is supported by a number of studies suggesting a relationship between viral dose and severity of disease [43]. The specific method of discarding disposable equipment should be in accordance with local policy, followed by hand hygiene [44]. In order to minimise human error, the CDC has advised a trained observer, with the sole responsibility of ensuring adherence to correct procedure, to supervise the donning process.
