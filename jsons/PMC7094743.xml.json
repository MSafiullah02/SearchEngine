Typical presentation was defined as the presence of non-toxic appearance with coryza, cough, and respiratory distress with wheezing for the first time. Infants with suspected bronchiolitis without wheezing or with an associated diagnosis of otitis media are not reported in this study. We excluded infants with previous wheeze/bronchodilator therapy, children with previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease, aspiration, neuromuscular disease, or chronic systemic disease, infants with prematurity <35 weeks gestation, infants with a birth weight <2500 g, or infants who underwent neonatal ventilation >24 hours.

All enrolled patients were treated with 2 to 3 consecutive nebulizations of 2.5 mg/dose of albuterol (suspended in 2 mL normal saline, via Hudson Updraft nebulizer with oxygen flow 8 l/min). Thereafter, all children underwent chest radiography. To evaluate the impact of radiography on management, immediately before the radiograph the ED staff and fellows were asked about their intended use of antibiotics and disposition if no chest x-ray were available. The radiographs were interpreted by the ED staff physicians/fellows according to predetermined criteria for simple bronchiolitis, complex bronchiolitis, or diagnoses inconsistent with bronchiolitis, according to a definition, and classified by the study nurse into these 3 categories on the basis of the physicians\u2019 responses. The study nurse then recorded the ED physicians\u2019 radiograph interpretation and subsequent disposition decision and antibiotic therapy given on the basis of this interpretation. To minimize the possibility of a significant change in the clinical status between the pre- and post-radiograph management plans, these plans were recorded immediately before and after the procedure, respectively. All radiographs were read at a later date by the primary study radiologist, who is considered to be an expert in lung disease (D.M.), according to the same criteria as used in the ED. A second senior staff radiologist (P.B.) also read the initial 242 radiographs to validate the \u201cexpert\u201d reading. Both study radiologists knew the patients were suspected of having bronchiolitis, but were blinded to details of the presentation, the ED interpretation of the films, the readings of the other participating radiologist, and the routine interpretation by staff radiologists not participating in the study. All enrolled children received a follow-up telephone call 1 week later about subsequent diagnoses and dispositions.",

One study did not report rates of airspace disease and only included children whom the admitting physician thought needed radiography,25 although another study included patients as old as 18 years, most of whom did not have bronchiolitis.11 A smaller bronchiolitis study by Farah et al26 found that 17% of infants had \u201cpathologic\u201d radiographs that included atelectasis. Because atelectasis is an integral part of bronchiolitis that rarely changes management, we have included atelectasis in the simple group. Furthermore, few children in Farah\u2019s study had fever or low oxygen saturation, and the association between these characteristics and radiographic outcomes could not be determined. Mahabee-Gittens found crackles to be the only independent predictor of pneumonia in young children with wheezing.33 This study was retrospective, radiographs were performed in only half the study population, and many children had wheezed previously.",

Ideally, the decision to do the radiography should be made after an appropriate review of the expected benefits of this procedure in each child (eg, in children with toxic appearances or those with unusual presentations or prolonged clinical courses). Also, our study had only 1 radiograph with lobar consolidation, and identification of any predictive factors for this high-risk feature was impossible. Although our recommendations are likely generalizable to non-pediatric EDs, some of our colleagues working in these settings may not feel as confident in diagnosing typical bronchiolitis and may have a lower threshold for radiography. Likewise, our colleagues in community hospitals can apply these results to their patients, provided they feel comfortable with the clinical diagnosis and adequate follow-up is provided.",
