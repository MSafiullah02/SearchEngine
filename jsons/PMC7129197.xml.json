Vaccination remains the principal means of control for seasonal infections and is the core strategy in pandemic influenza virus preparedness. The vast majority of influenza vaccines are produced in embryonated hens\u2019 eggs, using decades-old technology, with one egg resulting in approximately one trivalent vaccine dose. While egg produced vaccines have a long history of safety there are issues of bioburden using this production system and a very small proportion of vaccines have an allergic reaction to egg protein [3], [4]. The logistics of egg production require a 6 month lead time before vaccine production can begin. This lengthy lead time results in a manufacturing inflexibility and can result in vaccine shortages as occurred in the 2004\u201305 influenza season.",

The cell line must be permissive for a wide range of influenza viruses and permit their replication to high titer. The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) which has been used in public health surveillance programs, because of its sensitivity and productivity for influenza virus detection, fulfils these requirements [8], [9]. The public health requirement for hundreds of millions of doses of influenza vaccine is facilitated by the use of cells selected for suspension growth in large capacity fermentors [10]. Additional selection of the cells for growth in animal origin free (AOF) media excludes a significant potential source for the introduction of viruses, like those that may be present in bovine serum, during the manufacturing process.",

            "text": "While MDCK cells provide significant advantages in vaccine production, the safety of vaccines derived from these cells is of paramount importance. MDCK cells were derived in the late 1950s from the kidney of a normal Cocker Spaniel. Similar to many continuous cell lines, MDCK cells display a variable capacity to produce tumors when injected into immunocompromised animals [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Tumorigenicity is the ability of injected cells to produce tumors consisting of the same cell type in an immunocompromised animal. Oncogenicity is the ability of cellular elements to transform the cells of the injected animal into neoplastic cells that then grow into host animal-derived tumors [16]. The MDCK-33016PF cells used in the manufacture the Novartis cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine Optaflu\u00ae are tumorigenic in immunocompromised (Nude) mice. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that no residual cells are present within a vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that procedures are in place to ensure that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses. Additional steps in the manufacturing process have been introduced to inactivate viruses and to remove or inactivate functional and potentially oncogenic DNA. We report here on the studies conducted and the multiple and redundant processes used to ensure the safety of an MDCK-33016PF cell-derived influenza vaccine with respect to issues of tumorigenicity and oncogenicity.",

The results of these studies, which mimic the manufacturing process, indicate that in a worst-case challenge, BPL and polysorbate-80 are each capable of reducing the number of viable cells at least 10-fold. The cationic detergent, CTAB, had the strongest effect on cells with a complete destruction of cell cultures within 5 min. The extent of depletion of living cells by CTAB was shown to be \u22654 log10. However, the toxic effect of the reagents on cell viability during processing would likely be much higher than observed in the experimental approach, since the retention period of cells with each reagent would be much longer during the processing than in the experimental approach. Considered from this point of view the reduction capacity of the chemical moieties is unquestionably underestimated and a much higher depletion rate is anticipated.

In addition to reducing the size of the DNA, BPL markedly reduces its ability to serve as a template for DNA polymerases [17], [18], [19]. It was noted by these later authors that, under specific conditions, BPL treatment abolishes all traces of DNA activity when evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

There is, undoubtedly, DNA greater than ca. 200 bps, but the amount is below the level of detection of the CGE method, and there may be some DNA approaching 1000 bps in length, which is sufficient to potentially encode for an oncogenic protein. Therefore, a mathematical (statistical) modeling approach was used to estimate the potential amount of long DNA sequences. Using this approach, the distribution of DNA lengths before BPL treatment was estimated, as was the relative number of breaks induced by the BPL treatment. The distribution of DNA lengths following BPL treatment was then evaluated by a mathematical model similar to that of Bose and Git [20]. The results of this evaluation provide an estimate of the relative amounts of DNA greater than a chosen length, e.g., 500 bps or 1000 bps, that were below the level of detection of the CGE methodology. The model indicated that, for each of the three production runs evaluated, >99.99% of the residual DNA is below 300 bps in length and that the amount of DNA >500 bps approaches zero.",

The risk of this occurrence is, for all practical purposes, zero. MDCK-33016PF cells are partly killed during the replication of influenza virus and multiple specific steps in the manufacturing process remove or inactivate remaining cells. These processes include centrifugation, filtration, chemical inactivation and membrane disruption (viral splitting). The filtration steps, BPL virus inactivating stages, and viral splitting activities have been specifically investigated to determine their ability to remove or inactivate cells and each operates through orthogonal mechanisms. Collectively, the evaluated steps have the capacity to reduce cellular concentration by \u226541 log10 (validated data \u226535.6 log10). Given that up to approximately 10 million cells are required to produce one dose of vaccine, the risk of an MDCK-33016PF cell being in one vial is less than \u223c10\u221234.",

Viruses from these families may also establish latent infections or, become integrated into chromosomal DNA following abortive replication. In addition, viruses might be introduced into the cells from the virus seed, through human contamination or via raw materials. These viral risks were countered by two independent approaches.

A more definitive analysis for the presence of oncogenic DNA viruses is provided by degenerate PCR capable of broad detection of herpesviruses and polyomaviruses. These methods have been shown to be capable of detecting new viruses [24] emphasizing their utility in this role. The possibility of detecting oncogenic herpesviruses is enhanced by induction procedures that can result in genome amplification and recrudescence from latency.

Since these experiments were conducted, Khan and colleagues have formulated a specific algorithmic approach for the exclusion of retroviruses in vaccine cell substrates [30]; the studies conducted here are in accord with that approach. The PERT assay for retroviruses is a highly sensitive method for the detection of this family of viruses and does not rely on specific genome information.

Compared to existing egg-derived vaccines, the MDCK cells used to produce vaccine virus from influenza virus strains isolated in eggs do not introduce new or higher virus-associated risk, as the host spectrum of MDCK cells is similar to that of embryonated eggs. Using a simple risk scoring algorithm to estimate and compare the risks of adventitious agents when different cell substrates are used for virus isolation and vaccine manufacturing, MDCK cells used to produce vaccines from egg-derived isolates gave either the same or lower risk scores than embryonated eggs used for isolation and production [31].",

Burns reported in 1991 that DNA could be directly oncogenic in experiments using high levels of plasmid containing the activated HRAS gene [33]. More recently, scientists at the FDA have made important contributions by demonstrating the quantitative limits to direct DNA oncogenicity [34], [35]. In their initial studies, 12.5 \u03bcg of a plasmid capable of expressing both ras and myc were required to induce tumors in mice [35]. More recently, they have lowered this oncogenic level for a dual oncogene plasmid to 1 ng [36]. These recent data have reduced the safety margin estimate for 10 ng of high molecular weight DNA but methods to reduce the size or functional activity of DNA, like BPL treatment, can increase the safety factor (i.e. inverse of risk) by 107\n[36].",
