Although RSV-induced bronchiolitis is nearly always preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, it is not clear why an RSV infection becomes more severe in some cases. An interesting question is whether there could be differences between the nasal immune responses of RSV-induced bronchiolitis and RSV-induced upper respiratory tract infection.",

Increased levels of typical Th2 markers, such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and RSV-specific IgE, have been found in nasal lavage samples during bronchiolitis in infants [Welliver and Duffy, 1993; Garofalo et al., 1994] . In line with the increased levels of ECP, higher peripheral blood eosinophil counts have also been observed [Garofalo et al., 1994; Ehlenfield et al., 2000] . In addition, stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed enhanced Th2 cytokine responses in infants during RSV bronchiolitis compared with controls [Roman et al., 1997] . Proinflammatory and Th1 responses have also been found in infants with bronchiolitis. For example, the cytokines interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and IL-8, and chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a) and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were found in nasal lavage and blood samples during RSV bronchiolitis [Abu-Harb et al., 1999; van Schaik et al., 1999; Brandenburg et al., 2000; Garofalo et al., 2001; Sung et al., 2001; Tripp et al., 2002] . During upper respiratory tract infection in infants, elevated levels of proinflammatory and Th1 cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) have been observed in nasal samples [Noah et al., 1995] . Limited data are available comparing RSVinduced bronchiolitis and RSV-induced upper respiratory tract infection.",

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was based on the diagnosis of RSV infection in the presence of clinical symptoms and radiological findings characteristic for lower respiratory tract disease. In nearly all cases, the associated respiratory problems required hospitalisation of the affected children. Eight infants (median age, 26 weeks) were selected for comparison. They had participated in a prospective birth cohort study and presented with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms caused by RSV without bronchiolitis. None of the children with upper respiratory tract infection went to hospital. Physical examination was performed and nasal brush samples were taken from the upper respiratory tract infection group within the first few days after the onset of infection (median, 3 days). This was done within 24 hr after arrival in the hospital for the bronchiolitis group. To obtain baseline measurements, nasal brush samples were taken from all infants with upper respiratory tract infection and from 11 of the 14 infants with bronchiolitis during the convalescent phase of the disease (2 to 4 weeks later). The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus University Medical Centre Rotterdam. Written informed consent was given by all parents for participation of their child in this study.",

            "text": "IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine, and its effect is closely related to that of IL-1, i.e., the induction of TNFa, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), ICAM-1, Fas ligand, and several chemokines and the inhibition of IL-10 and IgE production [Nakanishi et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001] . IL-18 is also involved in antiviral mechanisms and is, in combination with IL-12, a powerful inducer of IFNg production from T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells [Dinarello, 1999] . IL-18 can therefore stimulate Th1 responses. In these nasal brush samples, an increase was observed in IL-18 and IL-12 responses during bronchiolitis, but this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the numbers of IFN-g positive cells. Garofalo et al. [2001] did find higher levels of IFN-g protein in nasopharyngeal samples of infants with RSV bronchiolitis compared with RSV-induced upper respiratory tract infection. It is possible that the increase in the expression of IFN-g per cell was too small to be detected in this study due to the immaturity of the children's immune systems. This is supported by the observation that when mononuclear cells or T lymphocytes from cord blood are stimulated with mitogen, lower levels of IFN-g protein are produced compared with cells isolated from adult blood [Chalmers et al., 1998; Pit et al., 2000] . However, the approach in the present study did not allow us to determine whether levels of IFN-g expression rather than cell numbers could have been upregulated. Despite this uncertainty, the observation of increasing numbers of IL-18 and IL-12 positive cells during RSV-induced bronchiolitis could explain the underlying mechanism of increased IFN-g production observed during general bronchiolitis in children [van Schaik et al., 1999] . With respect to the other proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, there was no similar distinction between bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Although IL-6 responses are increased during the acute phase of an RSV bronchiolitis compared with convalescence, this increase has also been observed for upper respiratory tract infection. There were no differences in the number of IL-8 positive cells. However, others have found increased levels of IL-8 protein in nasal samples during bronchiolitis [Abu-Harb et al., 1999] . Noah et al. [1995] found elevated protein levels for both cytokines in nasal pharyngeal samples of infants with upper respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, levels of IL-6 and IL-8 proteins in plasma were higher in infants with severe, as compared with mild, RSV infection [Bont et al., 1999; Brandenburg et al., 2000] . This discrepancy with the findings in this study is probably a consequence of the differences in the methods used to detect changes in the immune response. Where this study determined changes in cell numbers, the other studies examined protein levels.",

            "text": "Nasal brushes are easy to carry out in infants and can adequately document cellular immune responses in the nose. In these brushes, it was observed on the basis of morphology that cytokines are not only produced by inflammatory cells but also by ciliated epithelial cells. This is in line with other studies indicating that cytokines are produced by epithelial cells after infection with RSV [Arnold et al., 1994; Fujishima et al., 1998 ]. This explains the higher percentages of cytokine-positive cells observed in cytospins in the present study, as would be expected purely on the basis of the number of inflammatory cells present in such samples. A possible caveat of the study is the age difference between infants in the two groups, which could have skewed the results. Although cytokine responses could depend on the age of the child [Buck et al., 2002] , no evidence was found that the IL-18 data were affected. As shown in the Figure 4 , no age-related maturation of IL-18 responses was observed, either in infants with bronchiolitis or in infants with upper respiratory tract infection. Moreover, at baseline (convalescence), numbers of IL-18 positive cells did not differ between the two groups, and there was no age-related maturation. This shows that the differences in IL-18 response between the two groups are not due to differences in age, but rather that this response represents an increase in IL-18 positive cells in children with severe RSV-induced infection. Similarly, possible confounders, such as gender, birth weight, duration of pregnancy, cigarette smoking by the parents, and allergic disease in the family of the children, did not differ significantly between the groups and did not affect the results (data not shown).",

It would be interesting to determine whether this nasal increase in IL-18 could be a direct reflection of the immune response in the lower airway during RSV bronchiolitis or the severity of infection. A potential link between IL-18 expression and severity of disease has been postulated before. During tuberculosis, for instance, higher levels of IL-18 were found in patients with high-grade fever compared with patients without fever [Yamada et al., 2000 ]. An additional example of the link between IL-18 and severity of disease was observed in asthmatic patients. In patients with asthma, not only were IL-18 levels significantly higher in serum during an acute exacerbation than on remission days, but IL-18 levels were also related inversely to peak expiratory flow . Although patients were excluded who were positive for some of the respiratory viruses (RSV, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus), the study did not look for the most prevalent inducers of respiratory infection and asthma exacerbations, namely rhinovirus and coronavirus [Nicholson et al., 1993; Makela et al., 1998] . It is therefore possible that the increase in levels of IL-18 during exacerbations is a direct reflection of a respiratory viral infection.",

This has often described as accompanying bronchiolitis [Garofalo et al., 1994; Ehlenfield et al., 2000] . Until recently, the increase in numbers of eosinophils was thought to result from enhanced Th2 responses during infection [Roman et al., 1997] . The present study could not confirm this hypothesis, as no Th2-skewed response during bronchiolitis were observed. A previous study in our group showed that RSV-stimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes taken during bronchiolitis produced predominantly Th1, and some Th2, cytokines, whatever the clinical severity of the underlying disease [Brandenburg et al., 2000] . Similar results were recently published by Tripp et al. [2002] , who found an increase in both RSV-specific Th1 and Th2 cytokine-positive T lymphocytes during bronchiolitis compared with controls. On the other hand, the present data do suggest an alternative explanation for the observed eosinophil influx. IL-18 has been shown to induce the expression of the eosinophil chemoattractants RANTES and eotaxin [Campbell et al., 2000; Alaaeddine et al., 2001] . In combination with the increase in levels of ICAM-1 expression by IL-18 [Yoshida et al., 2001] , this cytokine could be responsible for the eosinophilia observed during and after bronchiolitis.",

RSV bronchiolitis was characterised by a strong increase in cells positive for the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. The increase in IL-18 positive cells is specific for bronchiolitis, as a similar increase could not be detected in RSV-induced upper respiratory tract infection. Although IL-6 and IL-12 responses also increased during bronchiolitis, these were not different from patients with upper respiratory tract infection. The strong IL-18 responses during bronchiolitis could be a direct reflection of the severity of infection and could explain the eosinophilia frequently observed during bronchiolitis.",
