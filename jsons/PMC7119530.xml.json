            "text": "Canine parvovirus-2 (CPV 2) causes a highly contagious and often fatal disease in dogs characterized by haemorrhagic diarrhoea and vomiting. CPV 2 emerged in 1978 as the cause of a new disease in dogs throughout the world, when it spread rapidly in domestic dog populations as well as in wild dogs with high morbidity (100%) and frequent mortality up to 10% (Appel et al., 1978). Between 1979 and 1981, the original CPV 2 strain of the virus was replaced around the world by a different genetic and antigenic strain termed as CPV 2a (Parrish et al., 1985). The two viruses differed in 5\u20136 amino acids, which constitute two different neutralizing antigenic sites on the surface of the capsid. In 1984, a further different antigenic strain was detected, which differed in only a single epitope compared to CPV 2a and designated as CPV type 2b (Parrish et al., 1991). These viruses become distributed globally and replaced original CPV 2 type, indicating that they must have been under strong selection (Decaro et al., 2007). CPV 2 has been isolated for the first time in India by Ramadass and Khadher (1982) and subsequently several outbreaks of the disease have been reported from different parts of the country (Kumar et al., 2003, Phukan et al., 2004, Biswas et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The laboratory diagnosis of infection with CPV 2 relies on the detection of antibody, the virus or both from animals suspected of infection. Antigen detection in faecal samples can be done by agarose gel precipitation test, virus isolation, counter immuno-electrophoresis (CIE) test (Ramadass and Khadher, 1982), virus neutralization test, haemagglutination (HA) test, electron microcopy (EM), fluorescent antibody test (FAT), antigen-capture sandwich ELISA or viral DNA detection by PCR (Mochizuki et al., 1993, Pereira et al., 2000). The HA test is simple, inexpensive and easy to perform but requires continuous supply of red blood cells of porcine origin, and the presence of non-specific agglutinin in faeces makes the HA test less reliable for CPV detection (Mochizuki et al., 1993). Recently, the PCR technique has been used increasingly for the diagnosis of several viral infections. However, conventional PCR methods are time consuming and suffer from carry over contamination. To overcome this problem, real-time PCR employing Taq Man probe (Decaro et al., 2005) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Ho-Seong et al., 2006) have been used for the diagnosis of CPV 2 infections in dogs with varying degree of sensitivity and specificity. In this study, real-time PCR employing SYBR Green has been developed for the detection and quantitation of canine parvovirus particles in faecal samples.",

Amplification was performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) and initial denaturation was done at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. The cyclic conditions consisted of 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 2 min and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min (Nandi et al., 2009). A total of 47 faecal samples were screened and 22 samples were found positive. In the positive cases and in positive control, a DNA band of 681 bp in length was visualized in 1% agarose gel under UV transilluminator.",

In this study, the development of a simple and rapid SYBR Green based real-time PCR for the detection and quantitation of CPV 2 DNA in the faeces of dogs. The real-time quantitative PCR is based on continuous optical monitoring of a fluorogenic PCR reaction (Heid et al., 1996). The CPV 2 real-time PCR assay was demonstrated to be more sensitive than both the HA and conventional PCR, being able to detect as few as 10 copies of CPV 2 DNA. This real-time PCR was highly reproducible and standard curve was linear over a range of seven orders of magnitude, from 10 to 108 copies, allowing a precise calculation of CPV 2 DNA in samples containing a wide range from 10 to 109 copies of viral DNA. Although there are various qualitative methods available for the diagnosis of CPV 2, the quantitation of number of virus particles in faecal samples can be done by quantitative real-time PCR. The standard procedure was followed for absolute quantitation of CPV particles by plotting the standard curve with a known number of targets DNA and corresponding Ct values were obtained.",

The SYBR Green based real-time PCR demonstrated greater sensitivity over HA assay and conventional PCR as it detected the samples with low copy number of virus found negative in other two assays. Real-time PCR has several advantages over conventional PCR, allowing a large increase in throughput and enabling simultaneous processing of several samples. The CPV 2 real-time PCR assay will also help in gaining new insights into the pathogenesis of CPV 2 infection, with particular regard to the amounts of CPV shedding in infected dogs or in animals challenged during vaccine trials. The possibility of determining precisely the duration and the amounts of viral shedding in the faeces is of fundamental importance to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines. Therefore, the real-time PCR can be a valuable diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity and can detect virus shedding during the initial stages of infection in dogs as well as in carrier animals and accordingly, the appropriate prevention and control strategy can be implemented.",
