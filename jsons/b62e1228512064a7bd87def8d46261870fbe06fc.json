To do this, a state of the art on collaborative decision-making, on ontology engineering and on collaboration engineering has been done. An eight-step ontology development methodology was adopted and implemented to build the ontology. A corpus made up of more than seventy-seven (77) documents was the starting point for the extraction of terms from the ontology and the UML (Unified Modeling Language) language served as a description language of our ontology. This ontology is intended to be the starting point for a facilitation support system in a Collaborative Decision Making process.

This decision-making is done most often in a collaborative way, hence the Collaborative Decision Making. Making collaborative decision-making can have significant benefits such as efficiency, taking into account all stakeholder proposals. However, a collaborative Decision Support System (GDSS) and the attitudes that encourage interaction and sharing are necessary to achieve these benefits. To do this, a number of approaches have been developed; most of them emphasize the need to use an automated tool. However, the use of predefined processes is essential because it allows gaining a substantial advantage of all the resources (human, technology, time, \u2026) mobilized for the decision making. An approach called Collaboration Engineering provides tools for designing collaborative processes for practitioners that can do without the intervention of a facilitator when using these processes [6] .",

Indeed, there are several works in the literature that argue UML can be used as an ontology description language because of their similarity [8, 9, 18] . In addition, we selected this solution because it allowed us to merge steps 5 and 6 of the methodology. In addition, UML would facilitate the implementation of the group decision making tool.",
