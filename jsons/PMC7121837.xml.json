The need for potentially effective \u03b2-lactam antibiotics as well as more effective \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors has motivated synthetic organic and medicinal chemists to design new functionalized 2-azetidinones. Besides their clinical use as antibacterial agents, these compounds have also been used as synthons in the preparation of various heterocyclic compounds of biological significance [3\u20137]. The potential use of some \u03b2-lactams as therapeutic agents for lowering plasma cholesterol levels has been documented as well [8, 9]. Extensive studies of the human leukocyte elastase (HLE) inhibitory mechanism and the biological activity of this class of compounds have also been published [10].",

            "text": "The emergence of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics is a serious clinical challenge [11\u201316]. Among these classes of antibacterials, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are still the most commonly used, over 50 years after their initial introduction. The most common mechanism for resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is the ability of bacteria to produce \u03b2-lactamases [17\u201321]. These enzymes hydrolyze the \u03b2-lactam moiety in the drugs, inactivating the antibiotics. Studies of amino acid sequence homology have identified four distinct classes of \u03b2-lactamase: A, B, C, and D [22]. Among these, classes A and C are currently the most important in human disease [21]. A successful approach to overcoming the adverse action of these enzymes has been the coadministration of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors together with the typical \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as pennicillins [21\u201324]. Unfortunately, this approach has been compromised by the discovery of new variants of \u03b2-lactamases, resistant to the inhibition afforded by known inhibitors [25\u201330]. Therefore, the development of novel \u03b2-lactam inhibitors to withstand inactivation by the ever-increasing diversity of \u03b2-lactamases has thus been a continuous and still on-going battle.",

Because LE has the potential to degrade some structural proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as elastin, fibronectin, and collagens, excess of LE activity has been involved in a number of pathological conditions that lead to the impairment of ECM organization, including rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and tumor progression [32]. LE also activates the proenzymatic form of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 [31], massively released by the PMN leukocytes and instrumental to their extravasation [33, 34]. A number of \u03b2-lactams, compounds widely used as antimicrobial drugs, have been identified as inhibitors of these serine enzymes, in particular LE [35]. Inhibitors of LE, and in particular of HLE, have a core structure of a four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring. Most of them are based on the cephem nucleus or are bicyclic compounds, such as clavams and cephalosporins. More recently, monocyclic \u03b2-lactams variously substituted have also been studied.",

Several investigators have suggested different models to predict the stereoselectivity, but their proposals were in conflict to some extent [126\u2013131]. An interesting contribution to the interpretation of the stereoselectivity in the \u03b2-lactam formation was done by Xu and coworkers [118]. They proposed a model based on a kinetic analysis of the cis/trans ratios of reaction product. Based on their results the origin of the relative stereoselectivity can be described as follows: a) the stereoselectivity is generated as a result of the competition between the direct ring closure and the isomerization of the imine moiety in the zwitterionic intermediate; b) the ring closure step is most likely an intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the enolate to the imine moiety, that is obviously affected by the electronic effect of the ketene and the imine substituents; c) electron-donating ketene substituents and electron-withdrawing imine substituents accelerate the direct ring closure, leading to a preference for cis-\u03b2-lactam formation, while electron-withdrawing ketene substituents and electron-donating imine substituents (EDG) slow the direct ring closure, leading to a preference for trans-\u03b2-lactam formation; d) the electronic effects of the substituents on the isomerization is a minor factor influencing the stereoselectivity (Scheme 48 and Fig. 2).\n\n",

The reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond was easily achieved by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of Raney Nickel W-2. Finally, treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and triethylamine involved the formation in situ of the N-trimethylsilyl derivatives which, treated with tert-butyl magnesium chloride, gave the expected (\u00b1)-2-azetidinones.",

The enhanced conformational flexibility of the carboxylate of the homologated penam derivative could enable the molecule to fulfill the geometric requirements of both A and C classes of serine \u03b2-lactamase. The longer chain might also enable the carboxylate to penetrate deeper into the positively charged pocket. In the second instance, they have hypothesized that placing a double bond in direct conjugation with the nitrogen, but exocyclic to the five membered ring, might also enhance acylation efficacy.

The additional carbon could allow greater conformational flexibility, thus allowing the carboxylate of structure I to occupy a space similar to that occupied in a typical cephalosporin substrate. It may be noted, however, that the compounds having the exocyclic unsaturation (II and III, Fig. 29) did not display a significant ability to inactivate either class A or class C serine \u03b2-lactamases. This could be due to the conformational rigidity imposed by the exocyclic unsaturation. These compounds were slowly hydrolyzed in buffered aqueous media and this hydrolysis was accelerated in the presence of the class A serine \u03b2-lactamase, thus indicating that they were good substrates. As in the penems and carbapenems, the unsaturation present on the five-membered ring (endocyclic or exocyclic) presumably further activated the \u03b2-lactam moiety towards hydrolysis. This could explain the reduced hydrolytic stability of structures II and III (Fig. 29).",

            "text": "Bacteria need to adhere to host tissue in order to cause disease. Many pathogenic bacteria assemble pili, i.e., extracellular protein organelles, to mediate attachment to host epithelial cells. Pilus assembly is performed by periplasmic chaperones, which bring subunits to the outer cell membrane where they are incorporated in the growing pilus [323]. A drug inhibiting pilus formation, termed a pilicide, would therefore have the potential of being an effective antibiotic. It has been shown, both by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [324] and by X-ray crystallography [325, 326], that synthetic peptides from the conserved C-termini of the pilus proteins are bound by the PapD chaperone (found in uropathogenic Escherichia Coli, which is the main cause of urinary tract infections). Thus, it has been found that PapD binds polypeptides by anchoring the peptide carboxyl terminus to the side chains of Arg8 and Lys112 (Fig. 30), two residues that are invariant in all periplasmic chaperones and are required for pilus assembly. On the basis of the crystal structures of peptide-PapD complexes [325, 326], \u03b2-lactams have been selected as potential chaperone inhibitors with the requirement of having different stereochemistry than the original penicillin\u2019s, thus having a chance to withstand enzymatic degradation by penicillin-resistant bacteria. The overall strategy consisted in creating small organic molecules with a rigid framework, which would locate the pharmacophores in the right position in the space [57]. In addition, this class of compounds allowed hydrophobic substituents (indicated by R) to interact with the chaperone while maintaining the important anchoring to Arg8 and Lys112. Moreover, the crystal structures showed that the C-terminal carboxyl group was within such a distance from Lys112 that replacing it with an aldehyde would allow an imine to be formed with Lys112.\n",

Curiously, most of this activity is directed towards Staphylococcus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These \u03b2-lactams showed a different behavior compared to all other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [327]. Rather than interfering directly with cell wall biosynthesis, through irreversible acylation of penicillin binding transpeptidases, these compounds seemed to affect cellular processes through transfer of the N-organothio group to a bacterial thiol. It has been also noted that these lactams exert antiproliferative properties against only a narrow range of bacterial genera, most significantly, Staphylococcus (including MRSA), Micrococcus, and Neisseria. This selectivity seems to be related to the levels and types of cellular thiols present in each microbe that is sensitive to the lactams, not to whether the microbes are Gram positive or Gram negative classes. The anti-Bacillus properties of a selected number of differentially substituted \u03b2-lactams based on the structure of Fig. 31 were also investigated by the same authors in 2006 [328].\n",

In general, lipophilic acyloxy or alkoxy groups at the C-3 carbon of the lactam ring led to the strongest growth inhibition properties against each of the seven Bacillus microbes examined. The most important substituent influencing the anti-Bacillus activity, as in the case of MRSA, was found to be the N-organothio moiety, with the sec-butylthio group having the best overall bioactivity. The mechanism of action of these lactams in Bacillus most likely paralleled that in Staphylococcus, with transfer of the N-organothio substituent from the lactam to a cellular thiol occurring within the cytoplasm of the bacterium [328]. Recent findings in 2007 indicated that N-thiolated-\u03b2-lactams react rapidly within the bacterial cell with CoA through in vivo transfer of the N-thio group to produce an alkyl-CoA mixed disulfide species, which then interferes with fatty acid biosynthesis. The studies on CoA disulfide reductase showed that the CoA thiol-redox buffer was not perturbed by these compounds; however, the lactams appeared to act as prodrugs. The evidence that these \u03b2-lactams inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis in bacteria, and the elucidation of CoA as a primary cellular target, offers opportunities for the discovery of other small organic compounds that can be developed as therapeutics for MRSA and anthrax infections [330]. The same authors have found in 2008 that these lactams also possess antifungal activity against Candida and other fungi by exerting powerful cytostatic effects that disrupt the structural integrity of cytoplasmic membranes. The mode of action and structure-activity trends of these lactams as antifungals parallel that previously seen in their antibacterial studies [331].",

Preliminary results of the antibacterial activity of some of these 4-alkyliden-\u03b2-lactams have disclosed the opportunity for the application of molecular modeling to relate chemical structures to antibiotic activity and to point out structural modifications that might increase antibiotic potency. Despite significant advances in the elucidation of the structures of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the overall structural basis for multidrug bacterial resistance has not been clarified. PBPs are a heterogeneous family of enzymes with transpeptidase and transcarboxylase activities involved in the synthesis and cross-linking of the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which is fundamental for the maintenance of bacterial cell morphology and integrity. On the basis of these considerations, the authors adopted a molecular modeling approach to identify attractive drug candidates and to contribute to the rationalization of functional group effects on the SARs. Thus, a series of \u03b2-lactams have been synthesized such as compounds of Fig. 34, that exhibited an inhibitory effect, generally more marked against Gram positive pathogens, although the spectrum of activity varied.\n",

For instance, sulfones showed considerably greater activity than the corresponding sulfides or \u03b2-sulfoxides, resulting the latter inactives [339].

The starting step, in all cases, is considered to be the \u03b2-lactam ring-opening performed by the OH of the Ser-195 belonging to the enzyme catalytic triad (Ser-195, His-57, Asp-102), to form the complex I. If the C-7 substituent is a chlorine atom, the expulsion of the 3\u2032-acetate, followed by loss of HCl and Michael addition of His-57 imidazole ring to the N-1 nitrogen, led to the inhibited complex II. However, when the C-7 substituent is a poorer leaving group, such as methoxide (III, Scheme 118), crystallographic data suggested that this group is not lost but the thiazoline ring-opening reaction generated an inhibited species. At this point, it is not possible to discern if there is a second covalent linkage between the inhibitor and the enzyme (IV, Scheme 118) or, alternatively, if a critical salt bridge between the released sulfinate and the His-57 imidazole is formed. In this latter case, the hydrolysis of the intermediate V is presumably slowed as the imidazole moiety is not properly aligned to deliver water to the serine carbonyl ester.",

They have also reported that C-4 unsaturation on the \u03b2-lactam ring raised the inhibitory activity towards these proteases, with selectivity over LE by 3-[1-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)ethyl] derivatives, and over the gelatinase MMP-2 by C-3-unsubstituted 4-[1-ethoxycarbonyl]ethylidene-\u03b2-lactams. Some catechins (vegetable secondary metabolites of the flavonoid family), and in particular those with a galloyl group (I, Fig. 35), have been shown previously by the same authors, to exert a very powerful inhibition of LE activity [341\u2013343], but their absorption, bioavailability, and metabolic fate awaited full clarification. Thus, in 2005 a number of monocyclic \u03b2-lactam derivatives with a galloyl moiety-like group in different positions were synthesized and tested [290]. Some of these, such as the N-galloxy-4-alkyliden-\u03b2-lactam (II, Fig. 35) appeared to exert an improved anti-LE activity.\n",

A series of 4-alkylaminocarbonyl-1-alkoxycarbonyl-2-azetidinones and 4-(alkoxycarbonyl)-2-azetidinones, bearing various carbonyl and thiocarbonyl functionalities at the N-1 position, have been prepared [351]. The results showed the potential interest towards N-thiocarbonyl-2-azetidinones as reactive structures for the design of novel elastase inhibitors. However, an electron-withdrawing substituent (activating group) placed at the C-4 position (or the C-3) was systematically required to reach a good level of enzyme inhibition. For instance, compound I of Fig. 36 was a good reversible inhibitor of PPE and HLE, acting most probably like 3-halide-1-alkoxycarbonyl-2-azetidinones (I, Scheme 119).

However, the C-4 substituents might not behave only as a leaving group, but they were involved also in the interactions with the enzyme S\u2032 subsite. The C-4 stereo-configuration requirements depended, then, on the nature of the substituents [364].",

The cis geometry of the rigid four-membered ring forces the three side-chains together into a fixed geometric configuration, enabling, presumably, the complementarity with subpockets of the receptor. Although the molecular weight of compound I is relatively high, its compactness provided some hope that the series might show significant oral absorption [381].

The phenylalkyl group at the C-3 and the monosubstitution at the C-3 and the C-4 positions seem to be less critical. A N-aryl group seems to be required, but there is considerable tolerance for the substitution at the phenyl ring.

While this 2-azetidinone together with compound I of Fig. 42 (SCH 48461) are extremely potent inhibitors of cholesterol absorption in vivo, the precise biological mechanism by which this inhibition takes place has yet to be discovered [383]. Data presented previously have suggested that there was a molecular target for these compounds, which has been designated as the CAI binding protein (CAIBP). The initial approach of Burnett and coworkers has been to use radiolabeled binding compounds for the identification of subcellular localization sites in intestinal cells [140, 389]. Having some knowledge of where the compounds were binding, they hoped to identify any specific proteins that had high affinity for this class of CAIs using other techniques. Based on their extensive SAR developments of the azetidinone CAI series, in 2002 the same authors have found that the two best structural sites for elaboration, while maintaining in vivo activity, were the N-aryl ring and the pendant aryl ring. For sensitivity reasons, their initial binding studies required radioiodinated analogs and thus, targets II and III (Fig. 43) came to the fore [140].\n",

Since it has been discovered that compound I (SCH 58235) in vivo exists predominantly as its glucuronide [388], in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanism of action, neither the free phenol nor the glucuronide could be precluded as the bioactive species. Therefore, the corresponding iodinated glucuronide of derivative V was required. This compound, depicted as VI in Fig. 43, has shown significant reduction of hepatic cholesterol esters. Thus, the same group of researchers has designed and prepared a number of potent CAIs with fluorescent absorption and emission properties making them suitable for use as biological tools in the investigation of the mechanism of action of this important class of new pharmacological agents [139].",

The antihyperglycemic effect of test compounds was evaluated by monitoring their effect on blood glucose and liver glycogen contents [390].

Several important SARs have been observed. First and most significantly, the N-methylthio group was required for the apoptosis-inducing activity of \u03b2-lactam I, (Fig. 45). In the second instance, an increase in the number of carbons on the N-alkylthio group was inversely proportional to the apoptosis-inducing ability of these \u03b2-lactams. Moreover, replacement of the N-methylthio moiety with an N-benzylthio group (IV, Fig. 45) also decreased the apoptosis inducing activity by ~70%. Another SAR was found for the chlorophenyl group in \u03b2-lactam I. Among the isomers I, II, and III, having a chlorine group in ortho-, meta-, and para-positions, respectively, on the phenyl ring, \u03b2-lactams II and III were less potent than \u03b2-lactam I (by ~20%).

The pathway of proteasome inhibition by the \u03b2-lactam III followed that of omuralide and salinosporamide A, that consisted in the acylation of a catalytically active threonine of a proteolytic \u03b2-subunit. This acylation was made irreversible by ring closure involving the chloroethyl group as an electrophile, as in the case of salinosporamide A [407], since treatment of III with methanolic base afforded the bicyclic pyrrolidine IV (Fig. 47). These results, together with the observation of proteasome inhibition in vitro, and the indefinite stability in neutral aqueous solution suggested that compound III was a worthy candidate for further biological evaluations.",

No appreciable influence of the absolute configuration, either at the C-4 or at the 1-phenylethyl substituent, on the inhibition of viral replication, was observed. The presence of an aromatic group at the 1-acyl substituent seemed to be important for the antiviral activity, as deduced from the lack of activity of the tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative g and the presence of activity of the benzyloxycarbonyl analog f, (Fig. 50). This latter compound showed the highest anti-HCMV activity within the \u03b2-lactam series, but with a very narrow therapeutic window, having a cell toxicity value close to the IC50 data for viral inhibition [263]. Interestingly, removal of the carbonyl group from the \u03b2-lactam ring, most likely acting as the serine trap, resulted in an azetidine derivative with anti-HCMV activity comparable to that of the reference compound ganciclovir [281, 419].",

The contributions examined are those published from 2000 till date; the literature survey was organized by type of reaction, and, among them, by year. The synthetic strategies reported are based either on novel methodologies or on already known but efficient and versatile protocols. An alternative methodology, reported in a separate paragraph, was the modification of preexisting groups linked at the different positions of the 2-azetidinone ring. Considering that the core structure of four-membered cyclic amide is the common feature of the antibacterial compounds, and that their biological and pharmacological activity are strictly related to the substituents linked to this small heterocycle, the modification of these linked groups not only afford new \u03b2-lactam derivatives, more complex and polyfunctionalized, but can produce molecules even more efficient in their activity. For this reason, a single paragraph of this chapter was focused on the studies reported in literature concerning the SARs of the \u03b2-lactams examined, with the aim of highlighting the possibility of designing new and even more efficient \u03b2-lactam compounds.",
