The legal basis for this was section 25(4) of the German Infection Protection Act. Because of legal regulations, no COVID-19 death was exempted from this order, even if its clinical cause seemed obvious. The case series demonstrated herein consists of 12 consecutive autopsies, starting with the first known SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013positive death occurring in Hamburg (the second largest city in Germany, with 1.8 million inhabitants). All autopsies were performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians was informed about the study (no. WF-051/20). The study was approved by the local clinical institutional review board and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. In all deceased patients, postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) and a complete autopsy, including histopathologic and virologic evaluation, were performed. Clinical records were checked for preexisting medical conditions and medications, current medical course, and antemortem diagnostic findings.",

In brief, full-body computed tomography was performed from top to thigh (slice thickness, 1 mm; pitch, 1.5; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAs), complemented by dedicated scans of the thorax with higher resolution (slice thickness, 0.8 mm; pitch, 1.0; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAS). We performed external examinations and full-body autopsies on all deceased persons with SARS\u2013CoV-2 positivity (PCR confirmed) as soon as possible after taking proper safety precautions (using personal protection equipment with proper donning and doffing), following guidelines from the German Association of Pathologists, which are closely aligned with relevant international guidelines. The recently published recommendations for the performance of autopsies in cases of suspected COVID-19 were taken into account (10). The interval from death to postmortem imaging and autopsy (postmortem interval) ranged from 1 to 5 days. During autopsy, tissue samples for histology were taken from the following organs: heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, brain, prostate and testes (in males), ovaries (in females), small bowel, saphenous vein, common carotid artery, pharynx, and muscle.",

The Ct (cycle threshold) value for the target SARS\u2013CoV-2 RNA (fluorescein) and whole-process RNA control (Cy5) was determined by using the second derivative maximum method. For quantification, standard in vitro\u2013transcribed RNA of the E gene of SARS\u2013CoV-2 was used (12).

Also, because of pathologists' potential risk for SARS\u2013CoV-2 infection, very few autopsies have been performed worldwide (18).

The coagulation system may be activated by many different viruses, including HIV, dengue virus, and Ebola virus (20, 21). In particular, coronavirus infections may be a trigger for venous thromboembolism, and several pathogenetic mechanisms are involved, including endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased levels of von Willebrand factor; systemic inflammation, by Toll-like receptor activation; and a procoagulatory state, by tissue factor pathway activation (22). In a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19, high plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed (23). The direct activation of the coagulation cascade by a cytokine storm is conceivable. With COVID-19, severe hypoxemia develops in some patients (24). Thrombus formation under hypoxic conditions is facilitated both in animal models of thrombosis and in humans. The vascular response to hypoxia is controlled primarily by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, whose target genes include several factors that regulate thrombus formation (25). Lastly, indirect causes, such as immune-mediated damage by antiphospholipid antibodies, may partially contribute, as speculated by Zhang and colleagues (26).",

The histopathologic changes in most of our cases with diffuse alveolar damage as the main finding resemble those described by Xu and colleagues (7) and Barton and colleagues (8), who reported single cases; Zhang and colleagues (26), who reported on lung biopsy in a patient with SARS\u2013CoV-2 positivity; and Tian and colleagues (27), who described macroscopic and histologic pulmonary findings in 2 patients with lung cancer who received positive results on SARS\u2013CoV-2 testing. However, the full-blown picture of diffuse alveolar damage seems to be more prevalent in younger patients with fewer preexisting diseases and longer survival, whereas older patients with more comorbid conditions tend to die in the early stages of the disease.",

Of interest, in most patients with disease, high titers of RNA were also detected in postmortem samples. The clinical relevance of this is not yet clear. Clearance of viral RNA from blood 7 days after transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with substantial clinical improvement, but studies have not shown a correlation between viremia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 (28, 29). As in patients with SARS\u2013CoV-1, in whom viral replication could be detected in other organs, including the liver, kidney, spleen, and cerebrum (30), we detected viral RNA at high titers in other organs (liver, kidney, and heart) in 5 patients. These data suggest that SARS\u2013CoV-2 may spread via the bloodstream and infect other organs. To prove this, replication intermediates must be detected.",

However, both the clinical and postmortem observations agree well with the current knowledge about SARS\u2013CoV-2 pathology. This includes the sex and age distribution as well as the preexisting conditions among the patients, but also the histologic findings. Second, although viral titers in swabs (pharynx) taken longitudinally up to 7 days after death remained similar, we lack data on how postmortem processes affect viral titers and dynamics in different tissues and body fluids. Moreover, the quantitative PCR assay used cannot discriminate between genomic and subgenomic RNA. As stated earlier, to prove viral replication, detection of replication intermediates or antigenomic RNA would be necessary.",

When hemodynamic deterioration occurs in a patient with COVID-19, pulmonary embolism should always be suspected. That patients with COVID-19 who have increased D-dimer levels, a sign of coagulopathy, may benefit from anticoagulant treatment seems plausible (31). As demonstrated in our cohort, this might be important for hospitalized patients and outpatients. In this context, some professional societies have already made recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for patients with COVID-19 (32). Robust evidence, however, remains scant, and further prospective studies are urgently needed to confirm and validate these results.",
