            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of cats caused by Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) strains. Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV) is a low pathogenicity FCoV that induces mild enteritis in cats. In contrast, the FCoV strains able to induce FIP are known as FIP virus (FIPV) (Pedersen, 1995). The FIPV arises from the FECV by a series of genomic mutations (Vennema et al., 1995, Rottier, 1999) and acquires the ability to infect, and to replicate within, macrophages. Infected macrophages transport the virus through the body (Pedersen, 1995). The frequency of these mutations increases in FCoV-endemic catteries (Heerewegh et al., 1997). Susceptibility to FIP depends also on individual factors such as age, sex and genetic predisposition (Foley and Pedersen, 1996). In a favourable environment, the infection is characterized by a \u201csusceptible\u2013infective\u2013susceptible\u201d (SIS) model: susceptible cats are infected but are not able to mount an immune response and become susceptible again (Foley et al., 1997). Cats that mount a good cell-mediate immune response show a degree of resistance to further infection. The activation of B cells leads to the production of antibodies. In vitro, antibodies increase the viral uptake by macrophages (Hodatsu et al., 1993), while in vivo they induce immune complexes formation and deposition (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980). During the disease a functional shift of T helper cells from Th1 to Th2 occurs (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998). The number of lymphocytes decreases in lymph nodes (Kipar et al., 2001), in the lesions (Kipar et al., 1998, Paltrinieri et al., 1998) and in blood (Sparkes et al., 1994, Pedersen, 1995). The cause of lymphocyte depletion seems to be lymphocyte apoptosis, most likely due to the release of pro-aptoptotic factors from phagocytes (Haagmans et al., 1996). In contrast, a Th1 cytokine response (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998), and a follicular hyperplasia in lymph nodes (Kipar et al., 1999) have been reported in cats resistant to the infection. Circulating lymphocyte subsets have been analysed only in few cats with FIP and strong individual variations have been reported (Knotek et al., 2000).",

            "text": "In contrast, cats from Group 2 were most likely living in FCoV-endemic groups. The repeated or the recent appearance of clinical forms of FIP in these catteries suggested the endemic presence of FCoVs and of persistent or recurrent faecal shedders of the virus (Addie and Jarrett, 1995, Kass and Dent, 1995, Heerewegh et al., 1997, Addie and Jarrett, 2001). The simple contact with the virus does not necessarily mean that the cats become infected: nevertheless, electrophoretic changes and fluctuations of some acute phase proteins (Giordano et al., in press), histological changes in lymphoid organs (Kipar et al., 1999) and increases of B-cell stimulating cytokines (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) have been reported in cats that do not develop the disease. This suggests that these cats may come into contact with the virus, most likely due to the shedding of FCoV by the affected cat or to increased fecal shedding among the cats (Heerewegh et al., 1997, Addie and Jarrett, 2001). The analysis of lymphocyte subsets supports this hypothesis. Although of variable severity, changes in total and differential lymphocyte counts were detectable in FCoV-exposed cats. These findings were most likely due to the different prevalence of FIP in the groups. Cats form sub-group 2A (high prevalence of FIP) had a moderate but persistent decrease in T cell subsets, more evident for CD4+. In sub-group 2B (mild prevalence of FIP), T cell subsets, and in particular CD8+ cells, were also reduced. However, in this group all lymphocyte subsets were transiently increased after the appearance of a case of FIP inside the cattery. In sub-group 2C (low prevalence of FIP but recent diagnosis of a case of FIP) the numbers within all lymphocyte sub-populations, and in particular CD8+ cells, were higher than in controls. These findings confirm that the appearance of a clinical form of FIP in the group is followed by increased number within all T cell subsets in the cats that did not develop the disease. This is in agreement with the recent detection of FCoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cells in cats with prolonged survival times after FCoV infection (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2002). In contrast, the low T cell counts detected in catteries with high prevalence of FIP suggests that the decreased number of these cells might be involved in differences in disease susceptibility among cats. This hypothesis is supported by the results recorded in cats with FIP, which had extensive lymphopenia with decreased numbers within all the lymphocyte subsets, in agreement with previous reports on blood (Knotek et al., 2000) and on tissues, where advanced FIP lesions were found to have less CD4+ lymphocytes than recent ones (Paltrinieri et al., 1998). Compared to controls, the percentage of CD5++CD21+ cells was significantly lower in cats with FIP, while the percentage of CD4++CD8+ cells was close to the percentage of CD5+ cells. Although the decreases in CD5++CD21+ cells was not significant (high S.D.), a similar decrease was also recorded in non-symptomatic cats from Group 2A, in which the prevalence of FIP was very high, and in cats from Group 2B after the appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery. This finding has been previously interpreted as a consequence of early apoptotic changes, which might alter membrane antigens, by a yet unidentified mechanism (Potter et al., 1999). Apoptosis of lymphocytes has been reported to occur during FIP, most likely due to the release of pro-apoptotic factors from phagocytes (Haagmans et al., 1996). It is possible that early apoptotic changes might be responsible for this finding in FIP-affected cats. However, the possibility that in FIP-affected cats the percentage of non-T\u2013non-B lymphocytes increases cannot be excluded. These findings, together with previously reported defects of T cell function (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998, Knotek et al., 2000) might play an important role in the development of FIP.",

This might reduce the diagnostic relevance of changes in circulating lymphocyte subsets in cats with FIP. Nevertheless, the decrease in T cell counts had a high sensitivity, thus reducing the possibility to have false negative results, but a low specificity, as usually occurs for changes with high sensitivity (Jacobson, 1991). \u201cFalse positive\u201d cats (cats without FIP with decreased T cell subset counts) might thus be detected. Moreover, the low PPV recorded does not allow cats with reduced lymphocyte subsets as being affected by FIP. On the contrary, the high NPV associated with a normal flow cytometry (and in particular with regards to CD8+ counts) may identify cats that are not affected by FIP.",
