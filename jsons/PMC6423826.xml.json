            "text": "Leptospirosis is a well-known zoonosis which causes outbreaks particularly in tropical countries. The causative organism is a spirochete of the genus Leptospira. History of leptospirosis is likely to extend to ancient times which is evident by Chinese texts describing \u201crice field jaundice\u201d [1]. In 1886, Adolph Weil describes a syndrome consists of jaundice, splenomegaly, renal dysfunction, conjunctivitis, and skin rash [2] and few years later, Inada described the causative organism of Spirochetosis icterohaemorrhegica [3] now known as leptospirosis. The classical untreated disease is described as a biphasic illness with initial acute leptospireamic phase followed by immune phase. Most cases are self-limited, but some patients develop fatal complications with severe disease. Jaundice and renal failure (\u201cWeil\u2019s disease\u201d), pulmonary hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), uveitis, optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis are well known complications [4]. After the resolution of febrile phase with the clearance of leptospiremia, the immune phase can occur in less than 10% of patients. However, atypical presentations are reported more frequently in the recent history [5]. In Sri Lanka, these differences of clinical presentations has been observed and attributed to micro-geographic changes [6]. There are more than 250 serovars of Leptospira which have been classified in to more than 31 serogroups and the different clinical manifestations are partially attributed to specific serovars. Understanding and identifying the varying clinical presentations of leptospirosis mimicking other diseases is important in clinical practice for early treatment and management. In this case series, we describe a series of male patients with severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement, presented to a single medical ward during a period of one month. Here we define cardiac involvement as positivity of at least one of following criteria. They are, 1) transient echocardiogram abnormalities during the illness 2) elevated troponin I titer which came down with the recovery of illness, 3) transient electrocardiogram changes during the illness.",

Case number 1 showed evidence of myocarditis in 2 D echocardiogram at the time of shock. Case number 4 had possible evidence of myocarditis whereas case number 2, 3 had normal echo findings. Case number 5 had severe mitral regurgitation in his 2D echocardiogram. All these echocardiogram were performed while the patients were in shock. Repeat 2D echocardiograms performed after three weeks of recovery were completely normal except in case number 4 and 5. Number 4 had mild left ventricular hypertrophy with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction and number 5 had trivial mitral regurgitation. In addition to these various echo findings all of these five patients had more or less positive cardiac troponin I titre which came down with the recovery of illness. Case number one and two developed atrial fibrillation which needed intervention for normalization. Case number three had mild T wave inversions in anterior leads which was dynamic in serial electrocardiograms. Case number 4 and 5 had only sinus tachycardia. All five patients had shock by definition and the most probable explanation is cardiogenic shock due to cardiac involvement of leptospirosis. Though not commonly reported, myocarditis in severe leptospirosis may not be a rare complication.",

Presence of unexplained cardiogenic shock, positive cardiac troponins, variable ECG changes are included for these criteria in addition to several other criteria [10]. Definitive diagnosis of myocarditis ideally should be established by histopathological, immunological and immunohistochemical criteria for which myocardial biopsy is required. This is not practical in most settings as these investigations are not routinely done and not required for patient management. In this case series none of the patients underwent histopathological or cardiac MRI diagnosis of cardiac involvement due to lack of resources in the hospital. Due to wide variability in presentation and non-specific clinical findings, many cases of myocarditis likely to go undetected. As an example, study conducted examining 24 hearts from patients who had died due to leptospirosis has revealed myocarditis in 96% of cases histologically. Endocardial inflammation had been observed in 50% of cases [11]. In Sri Lanka, myocarditis has been reported previously as a complication of leptospirosis [12, 13] and around 7\u201315% of confirmed cases are being reported as having this complication [6, 14, 15]. However, in most of the previous studies, the details of diagnosis of myocarditis was not clearly given. In our case series, histological diagnosis or cardiac MRI to diagnose cardiac involvement was not possible due to lack of resources in the hospital.",
