            "text": "Autoimmunity is an evolving process in which autoimmune responses shift in time not only against other determinants of the initiating antigen, but also against other self\u2010antigens (1\u20134). Determinant spreading, leading to the expansion of cohorts of autoreactive cells, is thus the hallmark of such a pathogenetic mechanism (3). How autoreactivity against a self\u2010epitope is triggered and how it spreads to other determinants of the same or of other self\u2010antigens, and what parameters can precipitate such drifting and lead to disease, is less clearly understood (5). For example, in autoantibody animal models, whether transgenic or otherwise obtained, escape of autoreactive B cells from clonal deletion or anergy alone is not sufficient to allow the development of a B cell\u2010dominant autoimmune disease, while additional factors such as infections, cytokines, help by T cells and others are required (6\u20138). Although the correlation may not be universally valid (9), its support to the hypothesis that T cell help and T and B cell cooperation are important for the onset of certain autoimmune conditions derives from many studies where model animals are immunized with modified self\u2010antigens or with cross\u2010reacting antigens mimicking self.",

            "text": "Immunization with a self\u2010protein normally fails to stimulate antigen\u2010specific T or B cells because of the establishment of tolerance mechanisms at the thymic or peripheral level which make any potential autoreactive determinant invisible to the immune system. Such a state of unresponsiveness to self\u2010antigen, however, is not absolute as breakage of tolerance can be attained by different approaches and at different levels. For example, mice immunized with synthetic peptides derived after the primary sequence of a self\u2010protein can activate unscheduled peptide\u2010specific Th cells, suggesting that ignorance rather then tolerance may play a role in some cases (10). Similarly, it is possible to activate an autoantibody response by using a modified self\u2010protein as an antigen (10\u201314). Breaking of B cell tolerance towards a conserved self\u2010protein such as ubiquitin has been achieved by inserting a foreign T cell epitope (11,12). Tolerance may also be broken by using cross\u2010reactive foreign antigens, such as cytochrome c, having limited sequence diversity to the murine protein (10). The latter reports illustrate how B cell responses to self are limited by lack of appropriate T cell help. The question arises as to whether determinant spreading occurs as a secondary response to activation of T cells by the heterologous epitope inserted into the chimeric self\u2010antigen. Dalum et al. (12) reported that if determinant spreading occurs in their system, it is only associated with and maintained by the exogenously administered modified antigen carrying the foreign determinant. In fact, in their case, a decline in the autoantibody titer occurred after suspension of immunization with modified ubiquitin, whilst the presence of endogenously produced ubiquitin would have suggested the possibility of a continuous stimulation of autoantibody\u2010producing B cells and thus progression towards a true autoimmune status. However, induction of tissue damage or other cytopathic effects were not reported in animals in which autoantibody production was triggered by inoculation of a modified self\u2010antigen carrying heterologous help. On the other hand, as the self\u2010antigens used in these cases (ubiquitin and cytochrome c) were ubiquitously expressed in the body of the animals, tissue damage was not examined in specific target tissues. Therefore the question could not be resolved as to whether breakage of tolerance by means of immunization with modified or cross\u2010reacting ubiquitous self\u2010antigen can precipitate the onset of an autoimmune syndrome in the absence of other inducing factors. To further investigate this aspect, we chose in this paper to use the murine \u03b1 glutathione\u2010S\u2010transferase (mGST) as a self\u2010antigen. In fact, the expression of mGST is restricted to a few sites, and particularly to the liver and lymphocytes, therefore allowing study of the effects of breaking of tolerance in a specific target organ. GST protein isoforms and genes from different species have the additional advantage of being very well known from a structural point of view, can be easily manipulate by insertion of a foreign helper epitope and can be rapidly purified to homogeneity. Furthermore, a well\u2010characterized mixed helper/B cell epitope, pep23, was chosen to provide heterologous help on the basis of its ability to induce a response in BALB/c animals; the latter strain was in turn used because there is no evidence in the literature that it may spontaneously develop a liver\u2010specific autoimmune disease. Our results indicate that, under our conditions, immunized animals develop anti\u2010mGST autoantibodies, epitope spreading to self\u2010determinants and inflammatory cell infiltration, but no signs of the onset of clinical autoimmune symptoms.",

In conclusion, these results suggest that T cell reactivity against the foreign epitope may spread to mGST\u2010specific determinants, thus providing the help acquired to break B cell tolerance.",

As a control of the effect of bacterial contaminants, animals immunized with schistosomal GST expressed in bacteria and prepared under the same conditions were examined. Furthermore, as a control of the effect of pep23, animals immunized with 23GST were likewise analyzed. Coded liver samples were processed by a histologist and anonymously examined by a pathologist. Conclusions of the blinded analysis performed in all livers from immunized mice exhibiting self\u2010reactivity showed the frequent presence of neutrophil infiltrations accumulating in small foci reminiscent of a mild hepatitis\u2010like situation (Fig. 6A, a\u2013c). Livers from non\u2010immunized mice (Fig. 6B, a) or mice immunized with the schistosomal GST23 protein (Fig. 6B, b and c) exhibited only normal parenchyma, but no infiltrations, thus indicating that the phenomenon observed is correlated with active immunization against self\u2010determinants, and with the presence of anti\u2010mGST antibodies and of self\u2010specific T cells. The finding in this case of specific cells infiltrated into liver tissue is in agreement with published evidence that autoreactive T cells are generally only a small component of these infiltrates, although they may play a major regulatory role (20). The general conditions of the animals before killing were good and no signs of viral infections or other diseases, such as loss of weight or hair, was apparent. This observation, in addition to further supporting the notion that the presence of inflammation signs is due to the induction of an autoimmune humoral and cellular response, also indicates that the treatment is not sufficient per se to precipitate overt functional organ damage and clinical symptoms.",

In most cases, however, the mechanistic role of autoantibodies in the initiation or maintenance of the autoreaction process is still unclear and, sometimes, production of autoantibodies may simply reflect a secondary event with no or little pathogenetic relevance (22). In recent years, models [including liver (23,24)] are emerging by which disease results not only from breakage of tolerance, leading to generation of an anti\u2010self repertoire, but from the breakdown of additional control systems which should normally keep autoreactive effector cells in check (25). Transgenic mice models suggest the existence of at least two checkpoints, one controlling the activation of autoreactive B and T cells and the spread of recognition of the initial cross\u2010reactive determinant to self\u2010determinants, and another determining the transition from autoreactivity to overt disease (25). For example, breaking peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocyte tolerance in a transgenic mice system fails to induce organ\u2010specific autoimmunity unless a second event occurs, such as infection of the organ by a pathogen (26).",

In addition to transgenic animal models, it was shown that in normal animals immunization with conserved foreign cytochrome c can also lead to the activation of autoreactive anti\u2010cytochrome c antibody\u2010producing B cells and, coincidentally, to activation of T cell clones directed against self cytochrome c (10). Breakage of B cell tolerance has also been obtained by immunization with a highly conserved protein, i.e. ubiquitin, in which a T cell epitope [ovalbumin (OVA)325\u2013336] had been inserted by recombinant DNA technologies in order to provide linked help. Such a chimeric protein elicited a strong autoantibody response against self\u2010ubiquitin. A concurrent response of T cells specific for the OVA determinant and for the self\u2010determinants carried by the ubiquitin moiety was induced (11). The continued presence of the immunogen, however, seemed to be required for the maintenance of the autoreactive state. Similarly, anti\u2010self\u2010autoantibodies and T cells can be stimulated by mice immunization with a hybrid ubiquitin carrying not only a Th cell epitope, such as a universal T cell epitope from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also a foreign B cell epitope derived from HIV\u20101 gp120 (13).",

            "text": "In all instances mentioned above, autoreactivity was triggered against an ubiquitously distributed determinant. Although epitope spreading to self\u2010determinants was described, no effect on organ autoimmunity deriving from these treatments, and no information concerning the initiation and maintenance of an autoreactive response leading somehow to disease, was reported. We have developed here an experimental model analogous to that applied by Dalum et al. (12) and Lohnas et al. (13), but in which a mGST is used as a self\u2010carrier in place of ubiquitin. The use of GST provides potential advantages due to the availability of a series of structurally related GST molecules (sharing significant\u2010to\u2010poor sequence identity depending on the organisms of origin) for which there is an extensive knowledge of the three\u2010dimensional structure (16). Most notably, different to ubiquitin and cytochrome c, GST can exhibit a distinct tissue specificity of expression, thus allowing us to address organ\u2010directed rather than systemic autoreactivity. In the present case, we have chosen to use a murine \u03b1GST protein produced in the liver (15). Murine \u03b1GST was engineered so to encompass a heterologous sequence derived from HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase, and including both a Th and a B cell determinant (19), as in the model of Lohans et al. (13) Immunization of mice with such a recombinant antigen leads to production of antibodies directed against murine GST determinants and to Th self\u2010epitope spreading. We also found that the presence of foreign help was no longer required after the initial immunization and that self\u2010reactivity could be boosted by successive exposure to murine GST devoid of heterologous help. No evidence of poor competition of autoreactive B cells for limiting help was observed, different from what was found upon immunization with ubiquitin carrying both foreign T and B epitopes (11), a difference probably attributable to the characteristics of the B cell epitopes used in the two studies.",

The recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes may in fact be important in clearing an infection or disposing of cellular debris, but may also produce host damage (27). Neutrophil infiltration has been reported, for example, in liver during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010induced inflammation (27). In our case, infiltrations seem to be related directly to the immunizing potential of the antigen rather than to endotoxic shock, because, on the one hand, we tested the absence of LPS in the murine GST preparations used and, on the other hand, schistosomal, non\u2010self\u2010GST, prepared and administered under the same conditions, was unable to trigger both antigen\u2010specific autoreactivity and neutrophil infiltration. Treated mice, however, did not progress further and their health conditions remained normal even after repeated immunization with self\u2010antigens and prolonged stabulation in good practice conditions, suggesting that other events are required to move to the next checkpoint in the progression of the autoimmune disease (7,25), related perhaps to pathogen infections or to other environmental factors. However, although treated animals were monitored for >6\u20138 months, it should be considered that the clinical signs of autoimmunity may follow the appearance of antibodies by a considerable length of time, thus suggesting that observation of immunized mice should be prolonged to the entire lifespan of the animals. Studies by Matesic et al. (27) also suggest that the genetic predisposition to the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration response may play an important role in controlling disease progression. Thus, induction of organ\u2010specific autoreactivity by means of immunization with chimeric self\u2010GST may constitute a useful model for the understanding of liver autoimmune disease and for the identification of precipitating environmental or genetic factors.",
