These travel restrictions, combined with potentially reduced HCT donor availability (due to infection, quarantine, and constraints on travel to collection centers) and complex allograft processing logistics (ie, donor assessment, collection, and on-schedule delivery for fresh infusion), directly impact a transplantation center's ability to infuse fresh donor cells into intended recipients on the scheduled day of transplantation. Recognizing these challenges, both the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) [9] and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) [10] initially issued a strong recommendation that all unrelated donor (URD) products be delivered and cryopreserved at transplantation centers before initiation of patient conditioning. On March 23, 2020, the NMDP informed transplantation centers that starting on March 30, 2020, cryopreservation of URD grafts would be required before initiating conditioning in transplant recipients [10]. Many transplantation centers have instituted similar practices for HCT using cells from related donors.",

A mixed method of direct matching and propensity score matching was applied before the analyses to obtain a control groups with similar clinical characteristics. The propensity score is the probability of a given patient to receive the cryopreserved graft, based on that patient's observed covariates. The propensity score was predicted for each patient using logistic regression accounting for following risk factors: disease histology (acute myelogenous leukemia versus acute lymphocytic leukemia versus chronic myelogenous leukemia versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia versus myelodysplastic syndrome versus non-Hodgkin lymphoma versus Hodgkin lymphoma), Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (\u226590% versus <90%), HCT-Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (0 versus 1 to 2 versus \u22653), conditioning intensity (MAC versus RIC/NMA), donor type (MRD versus haploidentical related donor versus 8/8 matched URD versus \u22647/8 URD) and recipient race. Two patients with equal propensity scores meant they had similar probabilities of receiving a cryopreserved graft. The distributions of estimated propensity scores between cryopreserved and fresh grafts were examined. We then matched each recipient of a cryopreserved graft with controls receiving fresh grafts, by matching on 4 covariates: graft type (BM versus PB), DRI (low risk versus intermediate risk versus high risk), recipient age (within 5 years), and propensity score (within 1 standard deviation from the pooled sample). The following procedure was adopted to find a maximum of 4 fresh graft controls for each cryopreserved graft case:1.Identify all potential matched controls for each case.2.Assign the control with the smallest age difference with the case. If there were multiple controls with the same age difference, assign one at random.3.Repeat steps 1 and 2 four times, to identify 4 controls.\n",

The marginal Cox model was applied to evaluate the main treatment effect while adjusting for the potential correlation within each matched pair. The assumption of proportional hazards for the main risk factor (cryopreserved graft versus fresh graft) for each outcome was tested by adding a time-dependent covariate. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P values were reported for each clinical outcome of interest, comparing the cryopreserved graft treatment group with the fresh graft group. Because of the large number of comparisons performed, only Pvalues <.01 were considered statistically significant a priori.

Using the CIBMTR database, we evaluated the 2 approaches retrospectively, using available data to adjust for known covariates. The most important finding of our analysis is that OS out to 2 years was virtually identical with fresh grafts and cryopreserved grafts. Second, there was no evidence of significantly delayed hematopoietic recovery or higher risks of either acute or chronic GVHD with cryopreservation. Marginal increases in relapse/progression and marginal decreases in chronic GVHD and DFS are of uncertain significance given the multiple comparisons in the study and the fact that this was not a randomized study. In fact, a key piece of information was unavailable to us, which is why these grafts were cryopreserved. One can reasonably assume that this was not a random decision. Although some delays might be precipitated by donor scheduling issues, many were likely influenced by clinical events necessitating requiring a delay in transplantation, and these events themselves might be indicators of prognosis (eg, delay because of the need for chemotherapy to achieve better pretransplantation disease control). Given this background, the similar survival outcomes are particularly reassuring.",

Administration of ptCY potentially mitigates the risk of GVHD by targeting alloreactive T cells that are rapidly proliferating early after stem cell infusion, and by relatively sparing regulatory T cells and leaving the nondividing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells unaffected [20]. Whether the proliferation kinetics of thawed alloreactive T cells different from those of fresh cells is not known. Murine data suggest that freezing and thawing of regulatory T cells results in loss of CD62L expression and a reduced capacity to protect against GVHD [26]. In addition, limited data indicate that cryopreservation can increase the sensitivity of porcine PB mononuclear cells (stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate) for IFN-\u03b3 production, but not for IL-6 production [27]. Despite these preclinical observations, our analysis did not reveal any clinically relevant differences in hematopoietic recovery kinetics, acute GVHD risk, or OS between fresh versus cryopreserved grafts for patients undergoing ptCY-based allo-HCT. Limited data in allo-HCT (with non-ptCY-based GVHD prophylaxis) using either BM 2, 3, 4, 5 or PB [6,7] as the graft source also show no impact of cryopreservation on hematopoietic recovery, GVHD, or survival outcomes. Although of uncertain clinical significance, the observations of lower chronic GVHD and DFS warrant further investigation, especially probing the impact on the freeze-thaw cycle on functional profile of immune effector cells. However, in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating cryopreservation of all URD grafts and the majority of related donor products, our data do not show a net safety signal against the use of ptCY-based platforms with frozen products. In this ongoing global outbreak, the ability to cryopreserve allografts has obvious logistical advantages, the most important being the ability to secure a graft before myeloablative therapy in a transplant recipient. Even under normal circumstances, it is sometimes advantageous to ensure the availability of an optimal stem cell dose before the start of conditioning (eg, in the setting of major donor/recipient weight discrepancy and/or advanced donor age).",

            "text": "We must acknowledge the limitations of our analysis. Despite propensity score matching, our analysis cannot adjust for unknown clinical parameters influencing the decision to use cryopreservation. We cannot assess the impact of cryopreservation on graft viability (compared with a fresh graft) or examine functional characteristics of thawed immune effector cells. We also acknowledge that chronic GVHD rates across both cohorts in the current analysis are higher than those originally reported with ptCY [20], likely a reflection of increased use of PB grafts in clinical practice [28]. BM grafts were underrepresented in our study, and thus we suggest caution in interpreting these results.",
