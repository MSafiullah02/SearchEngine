This methodological review introduces unique taxonomies to synthesize over 80 AD algorithms based on these six themes: (1) CCU; (2) Physiologic Data Source; (3) Harvested data; (4) Data Analysis; (5) Clinical Evaluation; and (6) Clinical Implementation. Review results show that most published algorithms: (a) are designed for one specific type of CCU; (b) are validated on data harvested only from one OEM monitor; (c) generate Signal Quality Indicators (SQI) that are not yet formalised for useful integration in clinical workflows; (d) operate either in standalone mode or coupled with CED or PD applications (e) are rarely evaluated in real-time; and (f) are not implemented in clinical practice. In conclusion, it is recommended that AD algorithms conform to generic input and output interfaces with commonly defined data: (1) type; (2) frequency; (3) length; and (4) SQIs. This shall promote (a) reusability of algorithms across different CCU domains; (b) evaluation on different OEM monitor data; (c) fair comparison through formalised SQIs; (d) meaningful integration with other AD, CED and PD algorithms; and (e) real-time implementation in clinical workflows.",

            "text": "Artifacts are extraneous signals with randomly varying amplitudes, frequencies and duration that interfere with physiologic signals acquired in clinical settings [24] . Longitudinal studies [25] [26] [27] [28] infer that Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) patient monitors have relatively simplistic built-in data preprocessing for Artifact Detection (AD). In this paper, the term AD encompasses one or more of the following mechanisms: (a) identification, detection or annotation of artifacts, (b) elimination of artifacts or artifact-laden data and (c) suppression or filtering of artifacts e.g., by using ensemble averaging or adaptive filtering [29] . The terms noise and cleaning have been used in publications as alternatives for the terms artifacts and AD respectively. OEM monitors typically come with a black box approach to preprocessing artifacts in physiologic data. Clinicians debate the reliability of OEM monitor data as they deduce that some built-in algorithms employ a reductionist approach that oversimplifies complex human physiology [30] . Artifacts can mimic physiologic data [31] [32] [33] , adding to the challenge of distinguishing between the two. As a result, data logged by OEM monitors remains impacted by artifacts [34] [35] [36] . This increases false alarm rates in monitors [36] [37] [38] , which leads to staff desensitization [30, 39, 40] . Clinicians cannot rely on analysing artifact-laden monitor data [41] , which in the past has resulted in incorrect diagnoses [33, 42] ; unnecessary therapy; surgery and iatrogenic diseases [32] . Independent research groups have developed a variety of post processing techniques to address the problem of artifacts in OEM monitor data. Fig. 1 shows the AD configurations reviewed in this paper. The purpose of AD is identical in any configuration, i.e., to assess and enhance the quality of physiologic data. Fig.  1 depicts Signal Quality Indicators (SQI) among other output variables. Latest AD research shows increasing interest in devising SQIs [43] [44] [45] [46] . This paper conducts a critical review of the development and utility of SQIs.",

This taxonomy, tabulated in Table  I , reveals that almost all techniques are evaluated in a single domain, with the exception of [23] which is evaluated in the ICU, PICU and OR. In general, trends in physiologic signals display similar dynamics across CCU domains [53] . This drives the hypothesis that AD algorithms could be modified for use across different critical care settings. However, domain specific information such as types and frequency of data, and patient demographics such as range of age, weight and medical condition may be directly, or indirectly, hard coded in the algorithm. Therefore, it is important to consider the original domain of clinical application prior to attempting application elsewhere.",

Therefore, knowledge of the monitor OEM and model is important for recognizing different biases introduced in the data. Some studies may collect data under certain inclusion and exclusion criteria as shown in Table II . Sample size is almost always given in the literature.

Frequency of the data is restricted by analog to digital sampling capability of the monitor [58] . Storage frequency depends on data logging capabilities of both the OEM monitor and the hardware and software mechanism used for storing study data.

According to Imhoff et al.

A new definition for multivariate analysis has emerged in recent research, and as such should be appended to the above as: (d) an algorithm is multivariate if it analyses different metrics derived from the same physiologic signal. Examples of multivariate type (d) research on the PPG is found in [59] and on multi-lead ECG in [34, 50, [60] [61] [62] [63] A uniquely different approach to multivariate analysis is found in [64, 65] , where two different data streams were acquired from the same probe making their physiologic correlation easier to exploit.",

            "text": "The Data Analysis theme characterizes the focus of each algorithm as: (1) stream; (2) patient; and/or (3) disease-centric. A stream-centric algorithm aims to indicate, quantify or improve signal quality of the data stream for increased reliability. Although the term patient-centric has broad implications in health care, it means here that the algorithm was trained on patient specific data and is therefore heavily tailored to each sample patient in the study. For example, baseline data from a particular patient may be required to instantiate an algorithm. BioSign [66] is an example of a realtime, automated, stream and patient-centric system. It produces a single-parameter representation of patient status by fusing five dimensions of vital sign data. A disease-centric methodology focuses on identifying or predicting a specific disease or a clinically significant outcome. The bradycardia detector in [67] and the prognostic tool for Late Onset Neonatal Sepsis (LONS) in [68] are both examples of stream and disease-centric approaches. The clinical contribution taxonomy reveals two unique configurations of AD: (i) Standalone AD and (ii) Coupled AD. As Fig. 1 illustrates, standalone AD techniques typically output filtered or original physiologic data, annotations and SQI. Standalone techniques are labeled as AD under clinical contribution in Table II . Coupled AD techniques are coded as part of algorithms that identify and/or filter artifacts similar to standalone AD techniques with the additional ability for CED or PD. Coupled AD configuration is shown in Fig. 1 and documented under clinical contribution in Table II. Signal Quality is a key element in this taxonomy. Missing segments, error, noise and artifacts inevitably affect data quality thus adversely impacting analytic accuracy and reliability [69] . To address this issue, Clifford et al. [70] recommend that an SQI calibrated to provide a known error rate for a given value of the SQI be made available for each datum. Nizami et al. [71] infer that it suffices for SQIs to be available at a frequency relative to the requirement of another AD, CED or PD application that consume the SQIs. The latter is particularly relevant when down sampled data is required by CED or PDs.",

            "text": "It is hypothesized that the performance of post processing AD algorithms can improve by consuming streaming SQIs output in parallel for each data stream by patient monitors [72] . However, use and delivery of SQIs is not yet standardised across OEM monitors. For example, in case of a lead disconnection the Philips IntelliVue (Philips, Germany) monitor outputs a random value above 8 million in data streams such as the ECG, IRW, HR, RR, SpO 2 and BP. This also generates a corresponding alert type of 'medium priority technicalalarm'loggedatavalueof\"2\".However,thisvalue is qualitative and not quantitative. The Delta, Gamma, Vista, Kappa and SC6002 -SC9000 monitor series (Dr\u00e4ger Medical Systems, Lubeck, Germany) output an SQI value between 0-100% for the electroencephalography (EEG) channel. This SQI is calculated using sensor impedance data, artifact information and other undisclosed variables. The same monitors also output a fixed label 'ARTF' indicating artifact on any monitored data stream [73, 74] . For example, the monitor classifies QRS complexes only at ECG values > 0.20 mV for widths > 70ms. An artifact condition 'ARTF' may be declared when the ECG signal does not meet these minimum criteria. Although OEM monitors may output signal quality information, there is no logical way to compare the SQIs produced by different monitors. Two confounding reasons are: (1) difference in quantification of SQI; and (2) lack of literature on proprietary algorithms. This reduces researchers' ability to determine how data has been affected from acquisition to logging. As a result, a post processing AD algorithm may need to be strictly matched to input data sourced from a particular OEM monitor as shown in Fig. 1 . Comparative studies led by Masimo [75, 76] declare that its 510 (k) FDA approved RADICAL SET technology has the highest quality measure called Performance Index (PI) as compared to 19 other OEM POs. In these publications, Masimo defines and calculates PI as the percentage of time during which a PO displayed a current SpO 2 value that was within 7% of the simultaneous control value. However, the Masimo SET technology does not automatically evaluate or log this quantitative SQI. Another quality measure called Dropout rate (DR) was calculated in [76] , which equals the percentage of measurement time during which no current SpO 2 values are displayed. Although Masimo SET showed equal or worse DR than two Datex-Ohmeda POs, the reasons for this data loss are not discussed by Masimo. Independent research groups that compared OEM POs in [55] [56] [57] neither researched the effect of the difference in data characteristics on SQIs nor did they mention if the POs output SQIs. Through a recent discourse in [77] on historic developments of the Masimo SET technology, its OEM has replied to Van Der Eijk et al. [56] , claiming greater accuracy in unstable conditions, such as motion artifact and low perfusion, leading to lower false alarm rates. However, [77] does not describe any SQIs that can be consumed meaningfully by other AD, CED or PD applications. This review recommends that AD algorithms that produce SQIs, such as PI and DR amongst others, be evaluated upon data acquired in [55] [56] [57] to contribute towards future AD research.",

This theme reviews clinical evaluation methods bases on this taxonomy: Data Annotation, Mode and Performance Metric. Results are given in Table II , in the top half of each cell of column four. There are no rules that define gold standards for clinical evaluation of AD performance. Each study sets its own gold standard against which its performance is evaluated. This includes evaluations of OEM monitors. Annotated physiologic data, where available, typically serve as the gold standard for validation studies. Events of interest in the data, such as artifacts and clinically significant events, are marked in realtime or retrospectively. The onus of perceiving what constitutesan\"event\"isontheexpertreviewers,whoidentify the event to the best of their knowledge. Inter-reviewer variability is the significant [78] or subtle [27, 79] difference known to arise when the same dataset is annotated by different reviewers. Retrospective data annotation has been supported by video monitoring in [27, 31, 36] . Video monitoring is only useful when the event is visually perceptible such as sleep movements, certain seizures and routine care. However, it cannot capture crucial physiologic changes such as HR deceleration or BP elevation. The advantage of real-time annotations is recording of richer and more accurate content with input from staff on duty. However, this can be costly and requires cooperation from busy staff. Study data is either collected in real-time from patient monitors or acquired in an \"offline\"mode for secondary analysis from existing databases. Review results show that majority of AD techniques were validated on offline patient data and very few were tested in real-time CCU environments. Table II also documents the types of performance metrics used in each research. It shows the common trends that will help future researchers to design and compare different algorithms by evaluating them using the same metrics. Numeric comparison of these performance metrics can be found elsewhere in [37, 43, 48, [50] [51] [52] . Performance metrics need to be interpreted very carefully since statistical significance, or absence thereof, is not always representative of clinical significance, or absence thereof. For example, one missed clinical event may not signify a statistical difference in the sensitivity of one OEM monitor over another. However, the same event could be very important clinically and crucial that it not be missed even once. Theoretically, a missed event or a false alarm are caused by artifacts of various types; for example, motion artifact and power line or optical noise induced in an attached or detached sensor. Studies that collected real-time annotated data or video monitored data, such as [27, 31, 36, 80-86] among others, can utilise the same data sets to develop and validate SQIs. Compatible SQIs can be used to compare performance of different AD algorithms and OEM monitors. Performance metrics, for example sensitivity and specificity in alarm studies, can be re-evaluated taking into consideration the SQI at each alarm instance",

GE Intellirate TM monitor (Milwaukee, WI, USA) issues asystole, bradycardia and tachycardia alerts by fusing ECG, ABP and PO data. It was evaluated by GE on a small population of 55 CCU patients in 2002 [87] . The evaluation was critiqued in [88] for lack of description of patient demographics and algorithm specifications. GE has republished the exact same study in 2010. The Saphire clinical decision support system [89] uses Intellirate TM technology, but does not evaluate it. Multi-lead ECG arrhythmia detection is deployed by GE in Datex-Ohmeda Bedside Arrhythmia Monitoring (Milwaukee, WI, USA), MARS Ambulatory ECG system and MARS Enterprise (Freiburg, Germany). MARS uses the OEM's EK-Pro Arrhythmia Detection Algorithm which has been evaluated in over 2000 monitored hours spanning at least 100 patients.

CIMVA (Therapeutic Monitoring Systems Inc., Ottawa, Canada) is a patented multi-organ variability analytics technology developed by Seely et al. [95] [96] [97] [98] . It is an online tool comprising of multiple coupled AD and CED algorithms with SQIs. Its AD performance is evaluated in [97] . CIMVA research can benefit from the recommendations made in the next section regarding common interfaces and formalised SQIs. This will allow for new AD, CED and PD algorithms to be integrated and tested as part of the CIMVA architecture. Otero et al. have implemented TRACE, a graphical tool which allows clinicians to edit monitoring rules and criteria in realtime. Coupled AD and CED algorithms based on fuzzy set theory input these customized criteria to generate patient alarms in [81, 99] , and detect sleep apnoea in [100] . Given its promising results, evaluation of TRACE against similar OEM monitors is recommended. The research conducted in 1999 by Schoenberg et al. [54] was integrated as part of the commercially available iMDsoft Clinical Information System [101]. However, algorithmic details and evaluation were never published. Artemis is a real-time data analytics system currently undergoing clinical evaluation in multiple NICUs around the globe [102] [103] [104] . As part of the Artemis framework, Nizami et al. [71] present SQI processing to improve the performance of coupled AD and CED algorithms for LONS. Ongoing Artemis research includes AD [80] ; CED of Apnoea of Prematurity [5, 15, 105] ; as well as pain management [9] . Adoption of the structured approach to AD recommended in this review can enhance the clinical performance of coupled AD and CED in Artemis. The coupled AD and CED algorithm for Bradycardia by Portet et al. [67] was evaluated on offline NICU data with the intent of integration with the BabyTalk project. BabyTalk's proof of concept has been described in several publications [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] . However, latest research by Hunter et al. in 2012 [111] infers that a long road lies ahead, including necessary clinical trials, before BabyTalk could be implemented in real-time clinical workflows. Several new AD and CED algorithms can be tested to improve outcomes of this project by incorporating formalised interfaces as recommended in this review. The patented HeRO\u2122 system (Medical Predictive Science Corp., Charlottesville, VA, USA) that scores neonatal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for predicting LONS is developed using coupled AD and CED algorithms [68] . It conducts a multivariate type (d) analysis of the ECG with multiple coefficients yielding a more sensitive result [84] . The algorithms in this 510 (k) FDA approved device have been extensively described and evaluated both offline and in realtime by Moorman et al. [84, [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] . This pioneering research has shown promising reduction in neonatal mortality by 2% in a randomized control trial on 3003 preterm babies across nine NICUs in the US [114] . The drawback of this trial was a 10% increase in blood work and 5% more days on antibiotics in the monitored infants. Ironically, this constitutes the original problem this research set out to resolve in [119] . It is recommended that other variability measures, such as those of RR as in [10] and PPG as in [123] , be evaluated in comparisonwiththeHeRO\u2122HRVscoretocomeupwith(a) individual scores for each data type; and (b) a composite score that exploits sensor fusion for improved outcomes. BioSign [66] has been evaluated retrospectively and in real-time in a number of clinical studies including randomized control trials in Europe and the US before 2006. However, no later publications could be located.",

This necessitates modification for validation and reuse in a different CCU domain. Algorithms may be hard coded to input OEM specific data types and frequency. This limits their use with different OEM monitor data. They may be validated under certain inclusion/exclusion criteria which need to be considered when applying the techniques in other contexts. Acquisition and sampling frequency play an important role in patient management since a critically ill patient's condition may deteriorate to a life threatening extent within seconds. Reusability is deterred when such implicit limitations are not expressed. Therefore, adoption of a standardised structured approach for design and reporting of standalone and coupled AD research is recommended. Conformity to generic input and output interfaces will ensure presence of all pertinent information. These interfaces, with common definitions for data type, frequency, length and SQIs, shall allow for matched selection and composition with other AD, CED or PD algorithms. Results from the first three themes are useful in selecting one or more AD algorithms that fulfill data requirements of given CED or PD techniques. Selected AD algorithms can be mixed and matched to discover optimal compositions for varying clinical requirements.",

Moreover, studies validating their use in different CCU domains and patient population are scarce. The resulting unknown bias imparted in OEM data leads to inevitable variance in analytic results which can effect clinical decisions. This variability can be decreased if monitors output comparable standardised SQIs. As of yet, SQIs do not conform to any standards and are derived differently in each publication, whether it be SQIs delivered by OEM patient monitors or by AD algorithms developed by independent research groups. Interestingly, none of the reviewed algorithms reported using SQIs provided by OEM monitors. Clinical utility of SQIs can be enhanced by using formalised definitions such that SQIs output by different preprocessing and post processing AD algorithms are comparable as well as compatible. An SQI matched to the same set of definitions is also proposed as a requirement at the input of AD, CED or PD algorithms. The objective is to enable the AD, CED or PD algorithm to compare the incoming SQIs generated by one or more AD techniques with their required SQI value. The CED or PD algorithm may then accept or reject incoming data segments based on fulfillment of the required SQI value. In conclusion, standardised SQIs are vital to allow informed clinical choices concerning use and validity of physiologic data.",
