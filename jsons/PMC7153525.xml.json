Depending on the machine used, the amount of hydrogen peroxide gradually builds up to 300\u2013750 ppm (1 ppm = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126) and is held there for 20 min. The most time-consuming part of the procedure is de-gassing; it usually takes 4 h before the decontamination room is safe to enter. But the masks are safe to wear after that, because the hydrogen peroxide decomposes into oxygen and water. Using the Bioquell Z-2 hydrogen peroxide vapor generator (Fig. 4\n), the Duke staff can disinfect 1250 masks per cycle, and 2500 per 12 h shift [1].",

Designed specifically for household use, the method involves two steps (Fig. 2). The first step calls for steeping used masks in hot water at a temperature >56 \u00b0C (typically 60\u201380 \u00b0C) for 30 min. The temperature and timing are based on guidance from the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China for killing the COVID-19 coronavirus [2]. In the second step, essential to restoring the electrostatic charge critical to their filtering function, the masks are dried with a standard\u2014but non-static\u2014hair dryer for 10 min. Successful regeneration is confirmed by sprinkling the mask with small scraps of paper\u2014if the paper sticks, the electrostatic charge has been restored.",

And on 31 March, 3M committed to doubling their worldwide output yet again and producing 600 million masks annually in the United States [16]. Even so, comparing this source of supply (600 million) to the potential need (3.5 billion) there is a clear gap. It is highly likely that masks will need to be reused, and multiple times. The United States is getting some help in closing the gap. On 2 April, the city of Boston received a well-publicized shipment of 1.2 million masks from China, with more reportedly on the way [17].",
