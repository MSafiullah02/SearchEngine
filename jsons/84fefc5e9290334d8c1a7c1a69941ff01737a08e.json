However, in contrast to DL, the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the N protein of DS has not been determined. In addition to differences in their pathogenicity, of the ten monoclonal antibodies specific for the N protein of the DL variant of 3HM, four do not recognize the N protein of the DS variant or A59, while the remaining six react strongly with A59 and show only weak reactivity to DS (3). Conversely, none of the seven monoclonal antibodies specific for the N protein of MHV-A59 distinguish the DL and DS variants of 3HM (Gilmore, personal communication). These studies suggest that the N protein differs among these three closely related strains of MHV. To address this question we examined the relatedness of the N proteins from the 3HM variants DL and DS and compare them to the N protein of the prototype A59 strain by comparing the [3H ] -leucine-and [3H ] -phenylalanine-labeled tryptic peptides using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

[3H] -phenylalanine labelling (panels Dr E and F) was used to examine nine additional peptides. Thus, the use of both[3H ]-phenylalanine and [3H] -leucine resolved the majority of the phenylalanine and leucine containing tryptic peptides in the N protein. The [3H] -leucine and [3H] -phenylalanine maps from DL and DS are virtually indistinguishabl% in agreement with the oligonucleotide fingerprints; however, there are small but significant differences between the two 3HM variants and A~9. The analysis of the tryptic peptides of the [32p]-labeled N proteins derived from infected cells is shown in Figure l~ panels G~ H and I. Very few [32p] -peptides were observed. DL and A59 could be clearly distinguished by the elution profile of the two phosphopeptides. Only a single peak of [32p] -label was detected for DS. The[32p]labelled peak at fraction 2 does not correspond to any [3H ]-labeled peptides and mayrepresent either a hydrophilic unresolved peptide or free phosphate. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the peak at fraction 2 represents free phosphate~ it is more likely an unresolved peptide for three reasons. First~ no acid-catalyzed decomposition of phosphopeptide to free phosphate occurred during our isolation procedure because identical maps were obtained when acetone or ethanol were substituted for trichloroacetic acid during protein isolation. Second, the equivalence between the counts eluted at fraction 2 and those retained on the column for [32p] -labeled A59 and DL strongly suggests that each peak contains a peptide. Third~ examination of the nucleic acid sequence of the genes encoding the N proteins suggests that twelve serine-containing peptides lacking leucine and phenyalanine could be derived by tryptic digestion. Of these, four would contain six amino acids or less.The data suggest that A~9 and 3HMunequivocably differ in the phosphorylation site on the peptide retained on the column.We believe that the N protein of all three viruses are also phosphorylated on a second small hydrophilic peptide not retained on the column. We cannot at present determine if these peptides are identical. Irrespective of this, we conclude that the three viruses differ in at least one site of phosphorylation on the N protein.Since phosphorylation of N is known to occur on serine residues (8,12),and since the nucleic acid sequence predicts the presence of 22 possible serine-containing tryptic peptides (1,i I), the paucity of [32p]-labeled peptides indicates that phosphorylation occurs at only one or at most a very few of the possible sites on the N protein. We conclude from our data that the phosphorylation of the MHV N protein is exceedingly specific and that the phosphorylation sites on the N proteins derived from the three virus strains are different. Particularly interesting is the finding that the N proteins of the two plaque morphology variants of 3HM differ in phosphorylation pattern. This observation might account for the difference in the antigenic determinants of the N proteins of DL and DS detected by monoclonal antibodies specific for the DL variant (3). Although the sequence of the N protein of DS is not yet known, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of DL and A59 suggest that there is only one nonhomologous region containing a serine residue (between amino acids Ala-136 and Ala-162). Analysis of the sequence divergence in this region suggest that tryptic digestion would yield a hexapeptide from A59 and an octapeptide from DL. Based on predictions of hydrophilicity the A59 peptide would be expected to elute faster from the HPLC than the JHM peptide (6). Although direct proof is lacking, these data suggest that a site of phosphorylation of A59 occurs at serine-135 and of JHM at serine-136. Our data predicts that an analogous serine residue will be absent from DS. Confirmation will await complete sequence analysis of the N gene from DS. It has been suggested that, in addition to possible roles in regulating viral gene expression and genome replication (2), phosphorylation of viral proteins may play a critical role in the assembly of enveloped viruses (~). To determine if there is indeed a difference in the phosphorylation of the N protein which could be correlated with viral maturation, we compared the [32p]-labeled tryptic peptide maps of A59 N proteins derived from purified virions, cellular membranes and the cytosol of virus-infected cells. No difference could be detected (data not shown), suggesting that complete phosphorylation of the N protein occurs immediately following the synthesis of the protein, in agreement with the previous kinetic studies of the phosphorylation of the N protein (I~). These results indicate that phosphorylation of the N protein of murine coronaviruses is a very specific process, since only one or at most two of the 22 serine-containing tryptic peptides are phosphorylated. The sequences around the phosphorylation sites on the N protein from different MHVs were found to be different from each other. The biological significance of such variation of phosphorylation sites is not clear, but it may contribute to the antigenic differences in the N proteins of these viruses demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies (3; Gilmore, personal communication).",
