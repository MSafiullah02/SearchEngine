They have since become New Zealand's most important vertebrate pests, with current numbers estimated at 70 million. Occupying more than 90% of the country (Cowan, 1996), they represent a serious threat to the conservation of native forests and native wildlife. They also play a role in the spread of bovine tuberculosis (Sutherland et al., 1996) with resultant losses in primary production.",

These viruses would either be pathogenic to brushtail possums, or suitable as vectors for the delivery of contraceptive antigens. An electron microscopy (EM) survey of brushtail possum intestinal contents (Rice and Wilks, 1996) revealed the presence of four types of viruses: adenoviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses and coronavirus-like particles. Other reports of viruses of the brushtail possum include a papillomavirus (Perrott et al., 2000) and a retrovirus (Baillie and Wilkins, 2001). Of these viruses, the adenovirus was selected as the most promising candidate for further investigation as a possible gene delivery vector.",

Embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated via the chorioallantoic membrane, the allantoic cavity, and yolk sac routes. Between three and seven passages were performed in each of these culture systems. There was no evidence of viral replication in any system. A molecular-based approach using degenerate PCR primers was, therefore, used to obtain DNA sequence information. In this paper, the sequence analysis of an adenovirus partially purified from the intestines of a brushtail possum is described. Adenoviral sequences obtained by PCR from intestinal contents of brushtail possums from different regions of New Zealand are also compared.",

The results of the phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that the brushtail possum adenovirus is a new member of this proposed genus. This preliminary classification is important for the design of further degenerate primers, as sequence alignments with members of the Atadenovirus genus will be more important than those with members of the other adenovirus genera. A definitive classification, however, may only be possible when complete gene sequences for the hexon and protease genes are available for analysis, along with the presence or absence of certain genus-specific genes. Examples of the latter would be the p32K gene, present only in atadenoviruses; the E1b regions, present in both atadeno- and mastadenoviruses; and the absence of proteins V, IX and the E3 region in atadenoviruses.",
