In this article, I link processes of becoming with those of place. Drawing on research focused on copper exploration and the junior mining sector, I describe the way resource potential is articulated through three distinct practices of placing: the placing of resource prospects within narratives of copper deficits; the placing of resource prospects in space; and the placing of resource prospects in juxtaposition to other projects. These promotional taken-for-granted practices within the junior mining industry not only underscore the way resource potential is tied to spatial and temporal narratives, but illustrate that the locus of resource potential is found in areas beyond the underground.",

            "text": "\"Resources are not, they become.\" This insight from Erich Zimmermann's (1933) work on resource economics has resonated across scholarship on resource geography over the past two decades. Zimmerman examined the way natural resources come in and out of use based on shifting social demands. His work shows how natural resources -as elements of the biophysical world that have a social value -are connected to cultural, political, and economic processes. The notion of resource \"becoming\" draws attention to these complex social relations, locating the origins of resource emergence in society instead of in an autonomous, disconnected nature. As economic and social interests change over time, so too do the elements that are defined as resources. The underlying appeal of \"becoming\" is that it focuses on process, troubling assumptions of resource permanence. Expanding on Zimmermann's insights, scholars have outlined how resource becoming includes not only the work of the social imagination, but also the material means of knowledge production that create resources as objects of calculation, investment, and value.",

Focusing on mineral resources, I trace how sites of mineral exploration are placed within commodity narratives, in space, and in relation to other resource projects. The prospect of resource potential, I demonstrate, stems from the way exploration companies situate particular targets of exploration within wider sites and temporalities of resource provisioning. While scholars have drawn attention to the practices of calculation, measurement, and labor through which certain subsoil domains become resources, my analysis draws attention to the relational elsewheres of resource potential. I show how potential in one location is engendered through particular practices of placement. I utilize place here, then, not as a noun, as in much of the rich literature on place, but as a verb, to place. Just as scholars have shown how places are dynamic, tied to narrative formation, and articulated through selective incorporation of external processes (Massey 1995; Hoelscher 2003; Martin 2003) , placing resources is a process that links areas of exploration with extralocal narratives, sites, and associations. I develop this argument through an analysis of metallic minerals and the junior mining sector.",

            "text": "So-called \"juniors\" are small mining companies that seek investment to explore mineral resource prospects around the globe. It is through these actors, social spheres, and investment mediums that the majority of metallic resources (gold, copper, nickel, silver, etc.) become mineral commodities. In contrast with the considerable body of scholarship on mining giants like Newmont, Rio Tinto, and BHP Billiton (Welker 2014; Rajak 2011; Kirsch 2014) , there has been much less written about junior companies, which number in the thousands (for exceptions see Tsing 2000; Majury 2013; Author 2016) . Unlike the giants, junior companies are not focused primarily on mining; they are more interested in resource speculation and exploration. Some junior companies produce viable mining operations, but most produce very little. If successful, they often sell out to or partner with larger mining companies. Even junior companies that fail to identify a viable mineral deposit are often successful in garnering investment along the way. \"Placing resources\" encapsulates the tactics that these junior companies employ to promote themselves and their projects. The data I present center primarily on copper, but the dynamics I discuss are widespread across the minerals that underpin the junior sector.",

It illustrates the multiplicity of actors within the public sphere who navigate uncertain and contested fields of knowledge and politics.

Yet unlike the public realms and diverse political contexts examined in previous work, the sphere in which junior mining companies promote their projects to potential investors is more confined. Moreover, the grids of space and time in which junior companies place their projects are largely constructed by the junior companies themselves. The value of \"placing\" as a theoretical framework, therefore, stems not only from its descriptive accuracy, but from the way it centers on the agency and actions of junior companies.",

            "text": "Placing resources is at root a process of producing potential. Potential refers to the capacity or latent ability to become something in the future. As Giorgio Agamben argues, however, potential also means impotentiality, or the equal likelihood of something not happening (Agamben 1999: 177-184; Agamben 1995: 44-48) . In other words, potential evokes a field of possible outcomes between un-becoming and actualization. A helpful illustration of the dialectics of potentiality comes from Mette Svendsen's (2011) study of fertility clinics in Denmark, where couples are asked to donate unused embryos for biomedical science. It is the blank space of disposal, the prospect that this biological material would otherwise be thrown away, that helps donating couples envision alternative potentials for embryonic cells within fields of biomedical science. The articulation of potentiality, Svendsen shows, is thus one that arises from the resetting of particular narratives that place cell material into new temporal and ontological fields of possibility. Like the blank spaces that help produce new understandings of potential for embryonic cells, the impotentiality of resource exploration -the notion that sites of mineralization might produce nothing of value -is embedded within the work of junior mining companies. This resonates with Ian Hacking's description of speculation -\"a playing with and restructuring of ideas to give at least a qualitative understanding of some general feature of the world\" (Hacking 1983: 213) . Placing resources describes the way junior mining companies \"play with\" and \"restructure\" commodity narratives, notions of space, and comparative projects to elicit \"qualitative understandings\" of potential for their exploration targets.",

Building on this work, my examination calls for more focused consideration of ontologies of resource potential. Theorization of resource ontology includes, of course, underlying questions of potential, as Kama's (2019) analysis of \"unconventional resources\" effectively shows. Rhetorically parsing out potential is nevertheless a useful way to avoid some of the pitfalls associated with discourses of resource inevitability -the powerful notion across popular, political, and academic spheres that resource presence means eventual resource extraction (Nader 2004; Chapman 2013; Hughes 2017) . Junior companies, after all, may describe their projects as resources, but what they are really asking investors to do is to see their projects as having resource potential. In her analysis of oil exploration in Sao Taome y Principe, Gisa Weszkalnys (2015) describes how the prospect of petroleum depends upon \"observations of potential\" to ward off doubt that nothing is really there (Weszkalnys 2016) . In a competitive marketplace of investment, junior companies likewise require continuous observations of potential, which may or may not relate directly to the subsoil domains they are targeting. Just as recent work asks about the locus of energy (Rajak 2011) . In this way, these large and small gatherings embody a shared social world that assorted actors refer to as \"the junior mining space.\" Both the PDAC and VRIC conferences feature commodity and market assessments by industry research firms as well as a group of industry analysts called metal writers, who offer their assessments of junior companies for an annual fee. Hundreds of junior companies occupy booths on the large convention floors, pitching their projects to potential investors, handing out one-page information sheets and multi-page documents In the next section of the paper, I examine discourses of future copper deficits that are projected to arise due to increased demand, decreased supply, and smaller numbers of projects coming online. I explore place as a practice of narrative alignment, through which junior companies interested in copper place their prospects within storylines of copper demand. In the following part of the article, I analyze place as a practice of location, examining the ways that junior companies locate their projects in space by positioning their exploration targets in relation to existing mines or other sites of exploration. In the final part of the article, I examine place as a practice of juxtaposition, outlining the ways that junior companies selectively compare their projects, or elements of their projects, with other junior companies as a way to foster distinction and value. These distinct variations of place, including situating, locating, and juxtaposing, capture the spatial and temporal ways in which juniors cultivate notions of resource potential.",

World consumption of copper totaled around 22 million tons in 2017. By 2028, according to sources compiled by Schwartz, the world will demand between 4 to 8 million tons more, with even further rates of growth by mid-century. Part of this increase will come from China, the world's largest consumer of copper. A more profound source of demand, Schwartz detailed, will come from the centrality of copper in a world increasingly defined by electrification and the utilization of carbon-free power.",

From his emphasis on horses and automobiles in New York to his reiteration of the projected increase in copper content across green infrastructure, Schwartz was visibly animated about the future importance of copper. His repeated emphasis on the differences in copper content between various items underscored his point that the upper limits of potential copper usage are unknown. Though his presentation centered on copper demand, Schwartz's enthusiasm was really about copper supply, and the prospect of copper deficits that such a shift in modern infrastructure would bring about. As he then illustrated, predictions of increased copper demand parallel forecasts of dwindling copper supply. The world's largest copper mines, Schwartz explained, are reaching the end of their productive lives. What is more, discovery of new copper deposits has not kept pace to offset these potential declines. As Schwartz outlined, this signifies a potential difference between global demand and global supply of nearly 10 million tons of copper by 2030. Thus, three storylines of increased demand, decreased supply, and limited discovery converged in Schwartz's presentation to comprise an overall discourse of projected copper deficits. This is the discourse of copper that junior mining companies try to place their projects within.",

These forecasts tend to say more about contemporary issues and anxieties than they do future resource constraints. While most in the junior mining industry take the prospect of copper deficits as a given, this assessment is not universal across all fields of mineral geology. Recent scholarship suggests that existing copper mines are more than able to supply copper needs well into the future Jowitt 2018a, 2018b) . Reflecting a similar point, one industry analysis from the London-based CRU Group even raised the possibility of a future copper surplus (Mining Journal, 4/9/19). The price of copper is less in 2019 than it was in 2014. Trade disputes between the US and China, combined with slowing economic growth, as well as anxieties about the coronavirus, indicate strong headwinds facing copper in the near and short term. The immediate horizon of price uncertainty underscores the extent to which predictions of future copper deficits (and elevated copper prices) represent what Jane Guyer has termed \"evangelical time,\" the orientation towards long-term horizons that obfuscate more medium-term timescales (Guyer 2007). Consistent with Guyer's notion of future horizons marked by change, temporalities of copper deficits take as a given major political and economic transformations. Discourses of copper deficits are evangelical, in Guyer's sense of the term, in that they imagine a world after -after major shifts in energy production and distribution have taken place.",

Images at the bottom of slide compared the copper content of \"old technology,\" a coal fired power plant (1.3t per megawatt) and a 1970s automobile (15kg), and \"new technology,\" a solar farm (6.8t per megawatt) and electric car (60kg).",

Optimistic forecasts of future copper demand suggest an increase of around 20-25% by 2030. Unlike the incremental yearon-year uptick in demand displayed by aggregate figures of projected copper use, the difference between 15 and 60 is more dramatic. In the same way that a social world defined by horses could not fully anticipate a world defined by automobiles, the increase from 15 to 60 suggests that the future world of copper usage may even be beyond our current forecasts.",

A common framing is found in the promotional pamphlets of Trilogy Metals, a junior company with exploration projects in northwest Alaska. Echoing its investor presentation that I attended in 2018, Trilogy's 2018 investor pamphlet opens with bolded text that says, \"Copper = Energy.\" A series of bullet points in relation to hi-tech energy and the Paris Climate Accord underscore interest in copper. Bolded text at the bottom page encapsulates the argument: \"Copper is the Green Metal of the Future,\" with \"Copper\" highlighted in brown and \"Metal\" in green. Trilogy's 2019 investor pamphlet went one step further, its first page adorned with images of a solar panel, a windmill, and an electric car (Figure 1 ). Like Trilogy and Carube Copper, the twitter feeds of junior explorers with interests in copper feature a stream of imagery associated with green infrastructure. Sierra Metals, a company with exploration projects in Peru and Mexico, for example re-tweeted (in early 2018) an infographic that compared the copper content between a VW Golf (20kg) and Chevrolet Bolt (82kg).",

The sense of equivalence between Chile and Ecuador becomes a proposition whereby Chile's history of copper mining morphs into Ecuador's present mineral potential and future resource extraction.

In other words, junior companies not only place their flagship projects in relation to existing mines and sites proven mineralization, but also in relation to more speculative areas. These are often located in the same district as the flagship project, but not always. For example, Candente Copper's flagship project in Peru is called Canarico Norte, which the company describes as a feasibility-stage project with measured and indicated resources. Alongside Canarico Norte, Candente is also promoting Canarico Sur, a copper-gold-sliver prospect, which the company defines through a language of unknown potential. The meaning of Canarico Sur is less about what areas of mineralization have been explored and more about the spaces that have not.

These projects taken together, Trilogy argues, constitute \"exploration upside\" across the entire district -meaning the district is one where exploration is on-going and potential ever-present. Even as Trilogy has outlined plans to construct a mine based on the Arctic site, it continually tethers that project into ongoing speculation and more \"open\" resource potential. Of interest to how we understand resource potential is the temporal story that comes with this practice of placing. Aligning these primary projects alongside ones of even greater uncertainty connects future extraction on the flagship property with future exploration in other locations. This produces a temporal horizon of exploration that continually resets the temporalities of potential. Even as companies advance exploration in one site, drawing increased focus to questions about scope of mineralization, mineral grade, and economic feasibility, they deflect some of that attention elsewhere, enfolding the potential of the speculative sites into understandings of the flagship project.",

The language of \"blue-sky\" exploration is one that presumes blankness -there could be nothing here. But against that blankness, \"blue-sky\" invites \"what if\" scenarios of imagined potential: What if these areas of geophysical conductivity are the first signs of extensive mineralization?

On a large poster on one side of the company's booth, Xanadu promoters showed a cross section of the Zaraa project, its most advanced exploration site. It was placed directly next to a cross section of SolGold's Cascabel project in northern Ecuador. In this case, however, the logic of the comparison was not to draw on the reputation of the Cascabel to indicate the promise of the Zaraa project, but to make that comparison so as to set the Zaraa project apart. The Cascabel deposit is fairly deep, situated some 600 meters underground, a location that raises concerns about the deposit's economic viability. Underground block-caving, as opposed to open-pit mining, requires a higher grade of mineral content to be economically viable. In contrast, Xanadu's Zaraa deposit is significantly closer to the surface. Placed side-by-side, the depth of Cascabel helped frame the significance and meaning of Zaraaa, and Xanadu's argument that its project represented one the best \"near surface\" or \"shallow copper projects\" in the world. Near surface is a marker of potentiality, the notion that the subsoil position of Zaraa makes it more likely that its copper mineralization will become a viable copper mine.",

Half-jokingly, I asked, \"But what you really seem to be saying is that Zaraa is better than Cascabel?\" He laughed knowingly. This precipitated a conversation about investment. The geologist admitted that, in a world of limited investment capital, the juxtaposed image was an argument that investors should prioritize Xanadu due to the accessibility of the Zaraa deposit. The notion of \"shallow copper\" runs throughout Xanadu's promotional material. Numerous bubble graphs highlight the seeming uniqueness of Xanadu's projects by placing these projects on graphs that show depth and copper content for existing mines and ones in development. As I saw at VRIC 2020, Regulus Minerals, with copper exploration projects in Peru, likewise used a graph that compared the depths of its exploratory drill holes with those of SolGold to articulate an argument of near surface.

The remaining were from known mining sites from around the world.

This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork that I have conducted since 2016 at global mining conferences. This includes the large annual meeting of the Prospectors and Development Association of Canada (PDAC), held in Toronto, and the smaller Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC). The five-day PDAC meeting, with an average of 25,000 attendees, and the three-day VRIC meeting, with an average of 4,000 attendees are spaces where financial investors and mineral exploration companies situate themselves and each other within overlapping storylines of global markets and subsoil resources. Venues like PDAC and VRIC are important arenas of cultural production in the way they establish and reinforce industry norms, practices, and expectations",

An associated map situates the Kutcho Property in relation to these mineral properties in northern British Columbia. Two are symbolized as \"producing\" mines while four others are marked as \"permitted development\"projects. Kutcho Copper exemplifies the subtle, if overt, ways junior companies locate their projects in space (Figure 2). Kutcho's account of northern British Columbia as a \"Top tier mining jurisdiction with major mines and permitted projects\" depicts the legal context as amenable to mineral extraction and therefore a low-risk political environment. Indeed for the junior mining sector, British Columbia is often described as a \"safe jurisdiction.\" In highlighting other sites of exploration and extraction that are located nearby, Kutcho seems to be reinforcing this point: If other companies have no legal or political trouble permitting mineral projects, then neither should we.Placing resource prospects in relation to other sites of exploration and extraction is also a way to engender inherent notions of resource potential. Adjacent sites of past mining or present exploration help naturalize the area's subsoil as one of mineral possibility. Kutcho describes how the company's prospect is located within the \"King Salmon Terrain,\" which it defines as a belt of geological activity known for massive sulfide copper deposits(Kutcho Copper 2018:   13). To locate a project in proximity to an existing mine or other sites of exploration presumes an underlying geological connection or equivalence between these places. In this way, neighboring mines like \"Red Chris\" and exploration projects like \"Brucejack\" not only validate the Kutcho exploration target, but instill a degree of expectation about further exploration. This sort of locational rendering is ubiquitous amongst junior exploration companies.Apart from its primary ventures in Jamaica, for example, Carube Copper recently announced its acquisition of three exploration properties in southern British Columbia. In its investment portfolio, Carube lists these properties as being, \"Favourably located in the Cascade Magmatic Arc, a rapidly emerging copper gold porphyry belt in Southwest B.C.\" (CarubeCopper 2018:18). Upon a map of southern British Columbia and Washington State, Carube superimposes what it defines as this geological terrain (Figure 3). In doing so, the company not only specifies its three exploration properties within this space, but also highlights four other \"known copper deposits.\" In a similar vein, the junior company Broadway Gold Mining narrates its copper-gold Madison Project as being located in \"the legendary Butte-Ananconda mining region\" of southwestern Montana (Broadway Gold 2018). A company-produced map further defines this \"legendary\u2026mining region\" by locating the geographic proximity between the Madison Project and existing mines run by Montana Mining and Barrick Gold (Figure 4).",
