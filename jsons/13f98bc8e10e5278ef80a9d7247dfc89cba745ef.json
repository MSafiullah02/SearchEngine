            "text": "Lymphoma is the most common malignant neoplasia in domestic ferrets, Mustela putorius furo. However, imaging findings in ferrets with lymphoma have primarily been described in single case reports. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe imaging findings in a group of ferrets with confirmed lymphoma. Medical records were searched between 2002 and 2012. A total of 14 ferrets were included. Radiographs (n = 12), ultrasound (n = 14), computed tomography (CT; n = 1), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 1) images were available for review. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 5.2 years (range 3.25-7.6 years). Clinical signs were predominantly nonspecific (8/14). The time between the first imaging study and lymphoma diagnosis was 1 day or less in most ferrets (12). Imaging lesions were predominantly detected in the abdomen, and most frequently included intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy (12/14), splenomegaly (8/14), and peritoneal effusion (11/14). Lymphadenopathy and mass lesions were typically hypoechoic on ultrasound. Mild peritoneal effusion was the only detected abnormality in two ferrets. Mild pleural effusion was the most common thoracic abnormality (3/12). Expansile lytic lesions were present in the vertebrae of two ferrets with T3-L3 myelopathy and the femur in a ferret with lameness. Hyperattenuating, enhancing masses with secondary spinal cord compression were associated with vertebral lysis in CT images of one ferret. The MRI study in one ferret with myelopathy was inconclusive. Findings indicated that imaging characteristics of lymphoma in ferrets are similar to those previously reported in dogs, cats, and humans. C 2013 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",

            "text": "L YMPHOMA IS the most common malignant neoplasia in domestic ferrets, Mustela putorius furo. Following insulinoma and adrenocortical neoplasia, it is the third most common neoplasia of domestic ferrets overall. [1] [2] [3] [4] In ferrets, lymphoma can be classified based on tissue involvement, including multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and extranodal. [1] [2] [3] The presentation and organ distribution of lymphoma has been associated with the age of onset. 5, 6 Mediastinal lymphoma is more prevalent in young ferrets, particularly less than 1 year of age. These ferrets tend to have an acute presentation and may present with dyspnea. Ferrets with mediastinal lymphoma may also have multicentric involvement. 2, 5, 6 Ferrets 3 years of age and greater have a variable presentation with multicentric disease being more prevalent. Clinical signs in older ferrets may be chronic and nonspecific depending on organ involvement. Some ferrets may have intermittent signs over several months, while others may be asymptomatic with lymphoma being diagnosed incidentally, detected either during routine physical examination or during evaluation of comorbidities. [1] [2] [3] Despite lymphoma being common in domestic ferrets and the use of radiography and ultrasonography being touted as part of the minimum database in the diagnosis of lymphoma, 1, 7 imaging findings in ferrets with lymphoma have been limited to a few case reports. 1, 2, 5, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] The goal of this retrospective study was to describe radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a series of ferrets with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma.",

The imaging reports generated by a board-certified veterinary radiologist at the time the study was performed were also reviewed. Ferrets were excluded if the imaging studies were unavailable for review. Any imaging studies obtained after the reported start of clinical signs until a diagnosis was achieved were included. In addition to the reported ultrasonographic findings, the maximal splenic and lymph node thicknesses were measured from the available images if they were not reported. As splenomegaly is common in ferrets, most frequently due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, 2 splenomegaly was subjectively graded as within incidental variation (\"incidental splenomegaly\") and larger than expected for \"incidental splenomegaly.\" Those with subjectively normal spleens or \"incidental splenomegaly\" were referred to as normal for the purposes of this paper, unless otherwise specified. Retrieved CT images were reconstructed with a high-frequency high-resolution algorithm (bone algorithm with edge enhancement) in 1.25 mm slice thickness.

Both aspirates and biopsy were performed in two ferrets, and both aspirates and necropsy in one ferret. One ferret in this study was previously described. 8 The median age at the time of lymphoma diagnosis was 5.2 years (range 3.25-7.6 years). Eight of the ferrets were neutered males, and six were spayed females. Prior disease histories included adrenal disease (n = 5), cardiovascular disease (5), cutaneous mast cell tumors (4), diarrhea (3), insulinoma (2), cataracts (2) , and one each of granulomatous lymphadenitis secondary to mycobacteriosis, renal insufficiency, and a chronic pelvic limb abscess. Cardiovascular disease included second degree atrioventricular block (3), systemic hypertension (1), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (1) , and in one individual both aortic insufficiency and arteriosclerosis. For most ferrets, the time between the first imaging study and a diagnosis of lymphoma was 1 day or less (12/14) . In one ferret each, the time between the initial imaging study and final diagnosis of lymphoma was 7 days and 6.9 months. The duration of clinical signs prior to reaching the diagnosis of lymphoma ranged from less than 1 day to 8 months with a mode of less than 1 day and a median of 6 days. Clinical signs include lethargy (n = 9), diarrhea (8) , inappetence (7), weight loss (6), ataxia (4), lameness (1), and vomiting (1) .

Sonographically the soft-tissue components of the mass were homogeneously hypoechoic. Cortical irregularities and disruption, consistent with lysis, were also present. Histopathology of the mass following limb amputation was consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma. This ferret was previously described. 8 Vertebral lysis was apparent radiographically in two of the three ferrets with T3-L3 myelopathy. In one of these two ferrets, there was geographic lysis of L1 involving the majority of the vertebral body and a pathologic fracture of the cranial end plate (Fig. 6) . Other radiographic changes present in this ferret included splenomegaly and decreased abdominal serosal detail likely due to poor body condition. On ultrasound, peritoneal effusion, splenomegaly with splenic nodules, and lymphadenopathy were detected. At necropsy, intramedullary lymphoma was found in the L1 vertebra with epidural extension of the tumor. Lymphoma was also found affecting the spleen, liver, pancreas, and FIG. 6.

            "text": "Multicentric lymphoma was the most common presentation in this study. This is consistent with prior reports in which multicentric lymphoma is the most common presentation in ferrets older than 3 years of age. 1, 5, 6, 12 The most common imaging findings in this study were intraabdominal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly with mildto-moderate peritoneal effusion. Lymphadenopathy consisted of multiple enlarged, predominantly intra-abdominal lymph nodes, particularly including the mesenteric lymph node. Only one ferret had peripheral lymphadenopathy, consisting of enlargement of the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes, in addition to abdominal lymphadenopathy. Lymph nodes greater than 6.2 mm thick sonographically were generally appreciable radiographically as round to oblong, soft-tissue nodules or masses in their respective locations. Of the three ferrets in which sonographically detected lymphadenopathy was not appreciable radiographically, only one had a lymph node thickness greater than 6.2 mm. That ferret also had a large, retroperitoneal mass that likely accounted for a lack of visualization of the enlarged mesenteric lymph node due to silhouetting and displacement. Previous studies in normal ferrets using ultrasound have reported the normal thickness of mesenteric lymph nodes as 5.3 \u00b1 1.39 mm and 7.6 \u00b1 2.0 mm. 13, 14 Given that some radiographically visible lymph nodes measured as small as 6.2 mm (which is within the reported normal ranges for mesenteric lymph nodes) it is possible that normal lymph nodes may be radiographically appreciable. In the authors' experiences, however, visualization of normal, small abdominal lymph nodes on radiographs of ferrets is uncommon. Normal abdominal lymph nodes are not radiographically distinguishable in dogs and cats. 15, 16 Although some lymph nodes in this study that were considered abnormal measured within the reported normal ranges, there were other changes to those nodes to suggest pathology, such as hypoechogenicity. In dogs and cats, sonographic changes that have been associated with malignancy include an increase in maximal short and long axis diameter (enlarged), an increase in short-to-long axis length ratio (more rounded appearance), hypoechogenicity, hyperechoic perinodal fat with an irregular nodal contour, and heterogeneity. [17] [18] [19] Similar to previous reports, the spleen was the most common extranodal site of neoplastic infiltration with lymphoma in the current study. 5 In a prior study splenomegaly was attributable to neoplastic infiltration in 67% of ferrets with lymphoma and extramedullary hematopoiesis in 33%. 5 In general, splenomegaly secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis is common in ferrets. 2 To the authors' knowledge, there is no reference for normal splenic size in ferrets using ultrasound. Grossly the normal spleen has been reported to measure 5.1 cm in length, 1.8 cm in width, and 0.8 cm thick. 20 Given that these are gross measurements, however, they were likely obtained postmortem. Splenic size is variable and decreases postmortem, so these measurements may not be translatable to antemortem studies with sonographic measurements. 21 The smallest splenic thickness in this study was 0.8 cm; using the gross measurement guidelines all spleens in this study would be considered enlarged. The degree of splenomegaly was therefore subjectively characterized as within incidental variation and larger than expected for \"incidental splenomegaly\" based on the authors' experiences. Of the seven ferrets in which splenic cytology was available, lymphoma was confirmed in the four ferrets in which the spleen was considered abnormal and cytology was performed. Of the three ferrets spleens in which cytology was performed and the spleen was considered within incidental variation, lymphoma was identified in one, and extramedullary hematopoiesis was confirmed in the other two.",

Mycobacteriosis can be diagnosed on cytology and biopsy of the affected lymph node or organ. 25 Granulomatous inflammatory syndrome is a newly recognized systemic disease associated with coronavirus that causes inflammation in the spleen and lymph nodes. 23 This syndrome results in a severe granulomatous disease that can affect the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Unlike lymphoma, it is usually seen in younger ferrets, but like lymphoma, clinical signs are nonspecific and depend on the organ that is affected. Patients with this syndrome usually have polyclonal gammopathy that can also be seen with Aleutian's disease virus and lymphoma. Definitive diagnosis requires cytology or biopsy of the affected organs. 23 Aleutian's Disease is a parvovirus that can cause lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. As with lymphoma and granulomatous inflammatory syndrome, Aleutian's Disease can cause a polyclonal gammopathy. Ferrets with this virus usually present with generalized signs of illness (lethargy, weight loss) as well as neurologic signs such as paresis or tremors. 24 Aspirates and biopsy samples of lymph nodes and the spleen can be difficult to interpret as the disease causes lymphoplasmacytic inflammation that can be easily confused with other diseases such as small cell lymphoma and Epizootic Catarrhal Enteritis. 24 In the one ferret with colonic lymphoma, there were minimal imaging findings including poor abdominal serosal detail and mild peritoneal effusion. At postmortem, lymphoma with mucosal erosions was detected in the colon. Segmental lymphoplasmatic enteritis was identified in the small intestines. This ferret presented cachexic, hypotensive, anemic, had melena, and died within 24 h of presentation. Given that melena is referable to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the clinical findings in this ferret could have been attributable to both Helicobacter mustelidae gastritis and lymphoma. It is also possible that lymphoma was present in other portions of the gastrointestinal tract, but was not detected postmortem.",

Hepatic lipidosis, identified in four ferrets, was not associated with radiographic or sonographic changes and may have been due to inappetence. 26 Given these findings, ultrasound does not appear to be sensitive for the detection of hepatic lymphoma in ferrets. Sensitivity of ultrasound for hepatic lymphoma has also been reported to be low in dogs, cats, and humans. 27, 28 One of two ferrets with renal masses had probable renal lymphoma based on the response to treatment.

An alternate possibility is that lysis may be relatively easier to detect in the lumbar spine where there is less superimposition of structures over the vertebrae, compared to the thoracic vertebrae where the ribs proximally are superimposed on the vertebrae. In humans with primary bone lymphoma, three radiographs patterns are described: the lytic-destructive pattern, which is predominantly lytic with or without a lamellated or interrupted periosteal reaction or cortical lysis; the blastic-sclerotic pattern in which there are mixed lytic and sclerotic regions; and \"near-normal\" findings in which there are only subtle radiographic changes and additional imaging (scintigraphic bone scans or MRI) is required. 29 Osseous lesions seen in the ferrets of this study and the prior reports are similar to the lytic-destructive pattern, and had cortical disruption. This is also the pattern most typically seen in canines and felines with osseous involvement from lymphoma or other round cell neoplasms. Diffuse central nervous system infiltration with lymphoma was present in one ferret. As lymphoma outside of the central nervous system was only detected in accessory adrenal tissues, this ferret presumably had a primary central nervous system lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in dogs and cats has not been reported to have an extraparenchymal vs. an intraparenchymal predilection. 30 In humans, lesions with primary central nervous system lymphoma are most frequently intraparenchymal, and metastatic central nervous system lymphoma is more frequently extraparenchymal. 30, 31 In this ferret, the meninges and choroid plexus were involved in addition to the brain and spinal cord. Protracted clinical signs in that ferret consisted of variable paraparesis and lumbar pain over 8 months from the start of clinical signs to the final diagnosis of lymphoma at necropsy. Gradual progression of signs and the protracted clinical signs suggests a relatively slow-growing process. Prednisone, administered for palliative treatment, was started approximately 3 months after the initial clinical signs. Radiographs and ultrasound, performed prior to starting prednisone, had minimal, nonspecific findings. Magnetic resonance imaging, performed 1 month after initiation of the prednisone regimen and 5 months prior to the diagnosis of lymphoma, was inconclusive. Administration of prednisone prior to the MRI may have resulted in partial regression of lymphoma, therefore making it more difficult to identify; however, the ferret did not demonstrate improvement of the clinical signs so whether prednisone affected detection of neoplastic infiltration or not is speculative. Additionally the MRI was limited in that only T2w images were obtained. Perhaps if additional sequences were performed, particularly T1w postcontrast images, or if a follow-up MRI was performed at a later date, meningeal or parenchymal abnormalities may have been detected. Also because the necropsy was performed 5 months following MRI, it is likely that the extent of the lesions seen postmortem had progressed com-pared to at the time of imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions in dogs and cats with primary central nervous system lymphoma (compared to white matter) have been reported to be predominantly T2w hyperintense with indistinct margins, T1w hypointense, contrast enhancing, had perilesional hyperintensity on FLAIR consistent with perilesional edema, and had a mass effect. 30 In humans, lesions have similar signal characteristics (compared to white matter) being T2w hyperintense, T1w iso-to hypointense, and contrast enhancing. 30, 31 These findings are considered nonspecific in dogs, cats, and humans, and lesions may not be detected with MRI at the onset of clinical signs. 30, 31 Two ferrets had no clinical signs referable to lymphoma. In one ferret, the owner palpated a markedly enlarged abdominal lymph node. Radiographic and sonographic findings consisted of multicentric lymphadenopathy, peritoneal effusion, a renal mass, a hyperechoic liver, and \"incidental splenomegaly.\" In the other ferret, progressive lymphocytosis was detected during routine treatment and monitoring of adrenocortical disease. Lymphoma was identified in the peritoneal effusion of that ferret. Additional sonographic findings included a multicentric lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly with splenic nodules, a cystic hepatic mass, and a renal mass (sarcoma).",

            "text": "Although this study describes the imaging findings in a small number of ferrets with lymphoma, it provides an important source of information for practicing clinicians. The small number of ferrets able to be included during the time frame of the study likely reflects that imaging is not performed in every ferret with suspected or confirmed lymphoma, and that a definitive diagnosis was not always attained prior to treatment in individuals with suggestive clinical and imaging findings. Ultrasound-guided aspirates of lymph nodes, spleens, and aggressive osseous lesions performed in ferrets of this study were each diagnostic for or strongly suggestive of lymphoma. Although aspirates are often the initial tissue sampling procedure, previous reports have cautioned the use of lymph node aspirates in the diagnosis of lymphoma as inflammatory and reactive changes may be misinterpreted as lymphoma. 1, 3 This is particularly true of the gastric lymph node in ferrets with gastrointestinal signs. A false positive diagnosis of lymphoma is considered not likely to have occurred in the ferrets included for in this study. Lack of a definitive diagnosis (i.e., false negative results) from aspirate samples likely resulted in exclusion of some individuals from this study. Analysis of the frequency of misdiagnosis and nonconfirmatory aspirate samples in patients with lymphoma was not performed. This study was also limited in that histopathology was not performed on all organs in each individual, and therefore, whether or not the changes seen were each attributable to lymphoma cannot be confirmed. Additionally, because ultrasound findings were based on the reports and images obtained; some structures were unable to be reassessed. This is particularly the case in which multiple lymph nodes were affected. Images of each lymph node may not have been attained, the imaging report may not have been complete in describing which nodes were affected, and measurement performed retrospectively on the available static images may not have reflected the actual maximal nodal thickness in that individual.",
