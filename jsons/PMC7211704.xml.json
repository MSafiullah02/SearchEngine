The evidence is based on the observations from South Korea, China, and Italy, where a considerable percentage of patients who were otherwise asymptomatic, regarding respiratory symptoms, developed anosmia and hyposmia; and hypogeusia was also a common complaint (5, 6% of 214 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients) [1].",

These complaints referred to the usual sensations, without corresponding abnormal findings in the oral area (such as excessive mucus secretion).
