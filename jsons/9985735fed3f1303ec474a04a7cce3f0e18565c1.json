To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.",

For each n-CoV genome, we calculated the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), in the form of a 61-component vector. In Fig  A1, we show the heatmap and the associated clustering of these vectors. Despite the high mutation rate that characterizes 2019-nCoV genome [30] , [4] , the overall codon usage bias among 2019-nCoV strains appears to be similar. Moreover, their associated vectors did not cluster according to geographic location, thus confirming the common origin of these genomes. Therefore, we will consider a unique vector to represent 2019-nCoV in the following analyses. Figure 1 . Clustering of the RSCU vectors associated to coronavirus. Analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence was closer to SARSr-CoV as in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree shown in Figure A3 .

Interestingly, analysis of codon bias in coronavirus genomes reveal that the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence has a clear origin from other beta-CoV's and is closer, specifically, to SARSr-CoV, consistent with their phylogenetic relationships ( Figure A3 ). In line with previous observations, we show that the mean CpG relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed [27] . Specifically, GGG, GGC, CCG (pyrimidine-CpG) and ACG (purine-CpG) present a very low frequence of occurrence, probably due to the relative tRNA abundance of the host. In fact, in human the abundance of tRNA in codons GGG, GGC, CCG and ACG are respectavely: 0, 0, 4 and 7.",

The corresponding gene products including S protein regulates virus attachment to the receptor of the target host cell [2] ; the E protein functions to assemble the virions and acts as an ion channel [18] , the M protein plays a role in virus assembly and is involved in biosynthesis of new virus particles [17] the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA [19] .

In Figure 4 , we show separately the ENC-plots obtained for the five genes (M, N, S, E, and RdRP), together with the Wright's theoretical curve, corresponding to the case when the codon usage is only determined by the GC3s [29] . We would like to point out that if mutational bias, as quantified by GC-content in the generally neutral 3rd codon position, is the main factor in determining the codon usage among these genes, the corresponding point in the ENC-plot should lie on or just below Wright's curve. In Figure 4 , all distributions lie below the theoretical curve, an indication that not only mutational bias but also natural selection plays a non-negligible role in the codon choice in all genes. This is exemplified by the violinplots in Figure 5 of the distances between the genes and Wright's theoretical curve. Genes N, S, and RdRP are more scattered below the theoretical curve than those of genes M and E, implying that in the latter the codon usage patterns are pretty consistent with the effects of mutational bias. Interestingly, data points corresponding to the gene N, which is the major viral structural component needed to protect and encapsidate the viral RNA, is localized around GC3=0.5 (See Figure 4 ). This means that the displacement under the curve most likely reflects the selective pressure exerted on this gene. Conservely, all other genes show a displacement towards lower values of GC3-content, thus corroborating our previously mentioned observation that coronaviruses tend to use codons that end with A and U (see section 2.3).",

Specifically, in line with the ENC-plot analyses, the genes S and RdRP present the largest deviations of their regression lines from the bisector lines and, therefore, a stronger action of natural selection.

In this analysis, the GC1 or GC2 values (ordinate) are plotted against the GC3 values (abscissa), and each gene is represented as a single point on this plane. In this case, the three stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) and the three codons for isoleucine (ATT, ATC, and ATA) were excluded in calculation of GC3, and two single codons for methionine (ATG) and tryptophan (TGG) were excluded in all three (GC1, GC2, GC3) (Sueoka 1988 ). For each gene, we separately performed a Spearman correlation analysis between GC1 and GC2 with the GC3. If the correlation between GC1/2 and GC3 is statistically significant, the slope of the regression line provides a measure of the relative extent to which natural selection and mutational bias affect CUB of these genes (Sueoka 1999) . In particular, if the mutational bias is the driving force that shapes CUB, then the corresponding data points should be distributed along the bisector (slope of unity). On the other hand, if natural selection also affects the codon choice of a family of genes, then the corresponding regression line should diverge from the bisector. Thus, the extent of the divergence between the regression line and the bisector indicates that the extent of codon choice due to the natural selection.",

Each gene in 2019-nCoV (taken as a reference) was confronted with the homologous gene in one of the 30 coronaviruses considered in this analysis. Each pair of homologous genes is represented by a point in the Forsdyke plot, which correlates protein divergence with DNA divergence (see Methods in [8] for details). The protein sequences were aligned using Biopython. The DNA sequences were then aligned using the protein alignments as templates. Then, DNA divergences and protein divergences were assessed as axplained in Methods in [8] by counting the number of mismatches in each pair of aligned sequences. Thus, each point in Forsdyke plots measures the divergence between pairs of homologous genes in the two species, as projected along with the phenotypic (protein) and nucleotidic (DNA) axis.The first step in each comparison is to compute the regression line between protein vs. DNA sequence divergence in the Forsdyke plot getting values of intercept and slope for each variant of gene. To test whether the regression parameters associated with each variant are different or not, we have followed a protocol founded by F-statistic test, considering a p-value \u2264 0.05.",

So a low biased codon usage pattern might allow the virus make use of several codons for each amino acid, and might be beneficial for viral replication and translation in the host cells. The The ENC-plot analysis reveals that natural selection plays an important role in the codon choice of the five conserved viral genes here considered: RdRP, S, E, M, and N. However, genes N, S, and ORF1ab are more scattered below the theoretical curve than those of genes M and E, implying that in the latters the codon usage is under more strict control by mutational bias. According with this analysis, the genes S and RdRP present the largest deviations of their linear regressions from the bisectors lines in the neutrality plot analysis that implies a stronger action of natural selection. Conversely, the regression line for the gene M is closer to the bisector than the other genes, meaning that this",
