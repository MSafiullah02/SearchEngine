During the next few months, spread of the new virus to pigs was described from countries all over the world, and several studies have shown the reverse zoonotic potential, i.e. transmission from infected humans to pigs, of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Hofshagen et al., 2009, Lange et al., 2009, Brookes et al., 2010, Forgie et al., 2011). In a recent study, 49 different introductions of H1N1pdm09 virus from humans into swine were identified globally during 2009\u20132011 (Nelson et al., 2012). Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that pigs are highly susceptible to infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and that the virus is transmitted readily between immune-na\u00efve pigs (Lange et al., 2009, Brookes et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Influenza virus infection of pigs is associated with high morbidity within infected herds (up to 100%), but mortality is typically low (less than 1%) (Van Reeth et al., 2012). Experimental studies with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have shown the clinical signs of infection to include a sudden onset and short course of fever, inappetence, lethargy, coughing, dyspnea, and nasal discharge (Lange et al., 2009, Brookes et al., 2010). Recent reports of pigs naturally infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have shown more variation in morbidity and signs of disease (Howden et al., 2009, Forgie et al., 2011, Holyoake et al., 2011). In a Norwegian field study clinical signs of disease were generally mild, and in more than half of the infected herds no clinical signs were observed by the farmers (Gr\u00f8ntvedt et al., 2011). Influenza viruses can act synergistically with other viral and bacterial pathogens to cause porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) (Thacker, 2001, Kim et al., 2003, Hansen et al., 2010). The observed inter-herd variation of clinical signs of influenza-like illness (ILI) reported from Norway may have been influenced by synergistic co-infections, although the Norwegian pig population has documented freedom from important respiratory pathogens like Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Lium et al., 2012).",

A minor epidemic of infection in the human population occurred between July and August, and the peak of infection was reached during October and November the same year. From December onwards, the number of cases steadily decreased (Herrador et al., 2012). The first occurrence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in a Norwegian swine herd was recorded on 10 October 2009 (Hofshagen et al., 2009). Prior to this the Norwegian pig population was documented free from swine influenza subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 (Lium et al., 2010). Within a few months the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had spread to more than one third of swine herds in the country, including closed nucleus herds with high levels of biosecurity (Gjerset et al., 2011). This indicated risk factors for infection other than the import of live pigs into the closed nucleus herds. The national surveillance programme for specific virus infections in swine for 2010 showed that 41% of herds tested had antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, while 48% were seropositive in 2011 (Lium et al., 2012). This strongly indicates that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is established as an endemic infection in the Norwegian swine population.",

The national surveillance program provided documentation on the historic freedom from swine influenza viruses (Lium et al., 2010). The outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus prompted an extraordinary surveillance program, where a larger screening of the population was initiated using serological laboratory methods to monitor the virus exposure in the herds. All the nucleus and multiplier herds were included in this serological screening. In additions, herds with suspicion of an active infection were tested for the presence of viral antigens. The main diagnostic criterion for a positive herd was having at least one virus positive sample or three or more blood samples (out of 20 or more) positive for antibodies against influenza A virus. If only one or two of the first 20 samples from a herd were seropositive, the herd was retested with blood samples from 20 previously untested pigs, and concluded positive if at least one of these samples were positive. The number of samples collected from each herd was based on an expected within-herd prevalence of 20%. Data from the initial phase of the Norwegian outbreak showed within-herd prevalence ranging from 5 to 100% (mean 59%) (Gjerset et al., 2011). The sample size selected provides a 94% confidence of detecting a within-herd prevalence of 0.2 by using a test with 95% sensitivity (Tse et al., 2012).",

This might also have contributed to reducing spread of disease between individual herds. However, the preventive effects of restrictions on animal movement was likely to be limited at the population level because in 60% of positive herds, farm personnel did not detect or report any signs of influenza in pigs, and thus were not subject to restrictions (Gr\u00f8ntvedt et al., 2011).",

This impression was verified by respondents\u2019 remarks during the telephone interviews in this study. Human vaccination in Norway started on 19 October 2009 with an AS03 adjuvanted monovalent vaccine against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (Pandemrix\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a., Rixensart, Belgium). Vaccination of personnel in close contact with swine production was recommended by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on 23 October (Folkehelseinstituttet, 2009, Herrador et al., 2012). By 26 October, a positive diagnosis for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 had been verified for 23 out of 51 (45.1%) tested herds (Hofshagen et al., 2009). By the end of 2009, 35.8 per cent (91/254) of all herds tested in Norway were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Gjerset et al., 2011). Although there was a high compliance of vaccination among farm personnel in the present study (range 70.4\u201391.2%), the possible protective effects on human-to-pig transmission was likely reduced due to late implementation.
