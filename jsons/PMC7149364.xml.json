Agriculture, the advent of City-States, European expansionism, and modern globalization have all had profound effects on the ecology of humans (Mcmichael, 2004). Our changing dispersal, demographic, and contact patterns have impacted both commensal and pathogenic organisms. Fruit flies in the genus Drosophila, numerous Yeast species, Escherichia coli and other human commensals tracked our expansion throughout the world (Keller, 2007, Pamer, 2007). However, pathogenic species followed too. In the 1700s and 1800s, smallpox and measles \u2013 spread to the Americas by European explorers \u2013 decimated indigenous populations (Mcmichael, 2004, Cliff et al., 1993). At the turn of the last century, the 1918 flu killed between 20 and 40 million people worldwide in little over a year (Noymer and Garenne, 2000). Troop movement during WWI played a critical role in the emergence and spread of that virus (Oxford et al., 2002). Today, we are beset by the human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic, the threat of pandemic avian influenza, hepatitis C, Ebola, tuberculosis, and myriad neglected tropical diseases (Mcmichael, 2004, Morse, 1995, Worobey et al., 2008, Hotez, 2014). The critical factors uniting the spread of commensal and pathogenic species, the emergence of new diseases, and the rapid spread of pandemic strains are the increasing density and connectivity of our populations, coupled with the evolutionary lability of many parasites, for example, bacteria and viruses (Scarpino et al., 2015, Galvani and May, 2005, Pourbohloul et al., 2009, Stoddard et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Modern travel patterns, heterogeneity in population density, variable immunity, and changing proximities to wild and domesticated animals interact to drive complex patterns of disease transmission and emergence (Galvani and May, 2005). SARS and SO-H1N1 spread rapidly around the globe, but because of heterogeneity in contact patterns and immunity, these diseases were not the disasters predicted early in the epidemics (Pourbohloul et al., 2009, Meyers et al., 2005). A similar situation also occurred during the 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where models with more realistic human contact patterns predicted yielded more accurate predictions (Scarpino et al., 2015). The threat of wildlife disease and its spillover to humans and our food is also becoming an increasing concern (Weiss and McMichae, 2004, Frenzen, 2004, Chua et al., 1999, Daszak, 2000). Changes in hunting and agricultural practices alter contact patterns between wildlife and domesticated animals (Daszak, 2000, K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008). The result has been both the spillover of highly virulent diseases, such as Nipah virus and Ebola, and recombination between human and animal strains of influenza (Weiss and McMichae, 2004, Chua et al., 1999, Daszak, 2000).",

            "text": "The emergence of HIV in central Africa illustrates both the importance of evolution and changing ecology on the epidemic potential of novel pathogens. The European reorganization of central Africa \u2013 from a dispersed collection of villages to a system with large urban areas \u2013 fundamentally changed human social contact patterns in the region (Figure 1\n; Hance, 1970; Worobey et al., 2008). Recent genetic evidence suggests that in some of these emerging cities, HIV epidemics were raging by the late 1950s or early 1960s (Worobey et al., 2008). Using historical census data (Hance, 1970), the author compared the rates of population growth, urbanization, and HIV infection \u2013 as reconstructed from HIV genomic data by Worobey et al. (2008) \u2013 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Gabon. Strikingly, the rate of increase in HIV infections lags the rate of urban growth, while the rate of population growth remains essentially constant (Figure 2\n). This result highlights the importance of both changing host ecology, in this case the urbanization of central Africa, and pathogen evolution in the emergence of new diseases (Schrag and Wiener, 1995, Antia et al., 2003, Weiss and McMichae, 2004, Holmes, 2009). In the next section, the author discusses modern methods for studying the dynamics of infectious diseases using genomic data and then in the following sections the author illustrates the role of these new methods in studying emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The primary tool for modern population genetic inference is coalescent theory, which provides a retrospective, mathematical framework for relating genetic variation to historical evolutionary processes (Wakeley, 2008). Coalescent theory permits the study of the evolutionary history of a population by sampling individuals in the present (Drummond et al., 2005, Wakeley, 2004, Wakeley, 2008). Consider a population in which individuals are related by a shared ancestry rooted at their \u2018most recent common ancestor (MRCA).\u2019 Going forward in time and starting from the MRCA, the population diverges with lineages forming and dying. Looking backwards, lineages fuse, reducing in number until only a single lineage remains; the coalescent is a quantitative, probabilistic framework for determining when lineages join, or \u2018coalesce,\u2019 backwards in time (Wakeley, 2008, Fu and Li, 1999). Because the coalescent considers neutral genetic variation, all pairs of existing lineages are equally likely to coalesce (Wakeley, 2008, Kingman, 1982a, Kingman, 1982b). The result is a genealogy tracing the current individuals backwards in time to the MRCA. The parameters of a coalescent model describe this stochastic, genealogical process. The rate that these lineages are born and die is also a function of the nonneutral evolutionary forces acting on the population and demographic processes (Wakeley, 2008). Therefore, selection, demography, and other evolutionary processes will leave signatures in the shape of genealogies (Wakeley, 2008, Drummond et al., 2005, Parsch et al., 2001, Nei and Takahata, 1993). The expected coalescent time and the rate of coalescent are both highly sensitive to changes in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. As a result, coalescent theory can be used to extract information about phenotypic evolution from the genetic variability of populations.",

            "text": "Applying coalescent theory to the study of infectious disease dynamics presents a number of challenges (Frost et al., 2015). First, sequences are typically sampled serially, as opposed to the classical application of coalescent theory where sequences are collected from a single time-point (Koelle and Rasmussen, 2012, Volz, 2012, Stadler et al., 2012). Second, unlike many traditional applications, often a large fraction of infected individuals are sampled (Volz, 2012). Third, complex population dynamics emerge from an epidemic process. In two recent papers, Volz et al. (2009) and Volz (2012) derived the coalescent for structured pathogens undergoing complex population dynamics. The models in (Volz, 2012, Volz et al., 2009) allowed for: (1) the nonlinear growth rate of pathogen populations during epidemics, (2) birth and transmission rates that change during an epidemic and are not always proportional to population size, and (3) the changing variance in the number of transmissions per infected individual. Using the novel coalescent framework developed by Volz et al. (2009), Rasmussen et al. (2011) demonstrated that with a model for the rate of coalescence, it was possible to infer historical epidemiological patterns from simulated sequence data. The statistical methods developed by Rasmussen et al. (2011) are Bayesian particle filter methods, which, once an equation exists for the rate of coalescence, can approximate the likelihood of a model given a genealogy.",

(2009) and Volz (2012) coalescent models can have arbitrary structure, but critically this structure must be static during the course of evolution. Consider a mutation increasing the transmissibility of a pathogen. As this mutation spreads, the transmission dynamics change. This effect can be easily visualized in the transmission tree, where hosts are connected if one host\u2019s pathogens seeds infection in an uninfected host (Figure 3\n). Because two pathogen lineages cannot coalesce unless they come from a shared host, changes in the transmission tree will affect the rate of coalescence for pathogens.",

The H3N8 strain had acquired a mutation that increased its ability to transmit between mammalian hosts (Anthony et al., 2012). Because influenza infects the gastrointestinal tract of birds and the upper respiratory track in mammals, transmissibility had been a barrier to species jumping. Variation in infection location is primarily caused by differences in the sialic acid binding site of influenza infecting avian and mammalian hosts (Fergusson et al., 2003, Smith et al., 2009, Suzuki et al., 2000). However, reassortment of influenza strains with different cell-type specificity and evolution in hosts with mixed sialic acid types, such as pigs, can facilitate spillover (Fergusson et al., 2003, Smith et al., 2009, Suzuki et al., 2000). Sequence data from the harbor seal outbreak suggests this as a mechanism for increased transmissibility (Anthony et al., 2012).",

During the 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, surveillance efforts primarily detected cases that were treated in healthcare facilities, and may have missed a sizable fraction of infections (Meltzer et al., 2014, WHO Ebola Virus Response Team, 2014). Initially, the CDC estimated for every Ebola case reported in Sierra Leone and Liberia, as many as 2.5 times as many cases went unreported (Meltzer et al., 2014). Accurate outbreak projections and assessments of intervention strategies depend on reliable estimates of underreporting rates. However, underreporting can be a very dynamic process, potentially varying in time, space, and/or with outbreak size, and driven by intrinsic properties of the pathogen, human behavior, diagnostic practices, and the healthcare infrastructure.",

From these data alone, one cannot estimate the rate of underreporting without making strong modeling assumptions and, even with such assumptions, we often lack statistical power to make precise estimates. However, underreporting can cause a mismatch between incidence estimated from case data and incidence reconstructed from genetic data using phylodynamic methods. For example, if there is a constant level of underreporting, case count data will reflect lower transmission rates and lead to underestimation proportional to the underreporting rate. However, the extent of genetic variation among viral sequences taken from the same set of cases will reflect the true, larger population size of circulating viruses, and lead to estimates closer to the true incidence. This is true even if viral sequences are only collected from reported individuals, assuming reported and unreported individuals are mixing with each other. In a phylodynamic analysis of Ebola virus genome sequences, Scarpino et al. (2015) estimated that underreporting of cases may be between 0\u201370%, with the most likely value being 17%.",

However, for others, such as SARS, Ebola, and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus host factors seem to play a larger role in regulating spread. Although a pathogen\u2019s often rapid rate of evolution can contribute to its epidemic potential, these high rates also facilitate the application of phylodynamic methods to the study of emerging infectious diseases.
