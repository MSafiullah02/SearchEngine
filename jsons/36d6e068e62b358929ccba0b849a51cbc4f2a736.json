The present study evaluated the possibility of plant originated approved 117 therapeutics against the main protease protein (MPP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 including drug surface analysis by using molecular docking through drug repurposing approaches. The molecular interaction study revealed that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where Azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp (-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of SARS-CoV-2. After the comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41, C145, and M165 of MPP played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372, A375, W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction surface of S proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors. ADME analysis also strengthened the possibility of screened plant therapeutics as the potent drug candidates against SARS-C with the highest drug friendliness.",

Similar to SARS and MERS, non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like protease coronavirus main protease, papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), structural proteins (e.g. spike glycoprotein) and accessory proteins were investigated in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 where non-structural proteins constitute two-thirds of the entire genome [10] . Among the structural proteins, Nucleocapsid (N) protein is prerequisite for RNA genome assembly where Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins are associated in viral assembly in the host environment [11] . Moreover, Spike (S) protein is mainly responsible for the viral entry into the host cell, and that is why spike protein is now being considered as a major therapeutic target for drug and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [12] . Again, The S protein interaction with the human ACE2 interface has been revealed at the atomic level, and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a main factor of coronavirus transmissibility in human to human [13] . On the contrary, coronavirus main protease (M pro) or 3C-like proteinase (3CLP) was reported for their ability to cleave the polyproteins into individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription [14] . The 3CLP is autocleaved initially from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme leading the translation of the messenger RNA [15] . Then the 3CLP cleaves all the 11 downstream non-structural proteins. As 3CLP plays a vital role in the replication cycle of virus in the host, it has been reported as the attractive target against the human SARS virus [16] . RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, other key target protein of SARS-CoV-2 catalyses the synthesis of viral RNA possibly with the support of other non-structural proteins as co-factors [17, 18, 19] .",

Hence, extensive in silico studies were performed to identify potential drug candidates, for example, Prulifloxacin, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, and Tegobuvi, were identified as repurposing candidates against COVID-19 by looking for drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease [28] . Again, Nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor was also predicted to be a potential inhibitor of COVID-19 main protease by another computational-based study [29] .",

Recent studies prioritized MPP inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 i.e. alpha-ketoamide, Hydroxy, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Favipiravir to evaluate their potency as drug [58, 59, 60] . Several in silico approach was also adopted to screen putative drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 [61, 62] . However, all these experiments used either main protease proteins or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 as probable drug targets. In this study, we screened potential natural therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 MPP, RdRp and spike protein by molecular docking approach. Here, Rifampin, Azobechalcone and Azobechalcone were determined as top most drug candidates as they interacted with SARS-CoV-2 MPP, RdRp and spike protein with lowest negative binding energy had the highest negative binding energy (-16.3 kcal/mol, -15.9 kcal /mol and -14.4 kcal/mol respectively. However, comparative analysis revealed the superiority of 5 drug candidates i.e. Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine, Fangchinoline against SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 4 ). The common drug surface hotspots were analyzed along with modeling of pharmacophore which is very important step for drug discovery. Three amino acid residues i.e. H41, C145, and M165 played the crucial role for the interaction of MPP with its inhibitors (i.e. Rifampin, Amentoflavone, Cepharanthine) (Table 1) .",

Most importantly, the binding patterns of spike protein with Isolophirachalcone, Fangchinoline and Tetrandrine were significantly similar. This study revealed the possibility of these amino acids to efficiently interact with drugs, though requires validation in wet lab trials. ADME analysis of top drug candidates reveled no undesirable consequences by these compounds. Various physico-chemical parameters, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics properties and water solubility were determined (Table 5 ). In addition, no BBB permeant were identified among the top most inhibitors of MPP, RdRp and spike protein. The consequence of association of the natural inhibitory drugs of three key proteins with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) suggests that no substantial inhibition can occur.
