            "text": "In contrast to methods like Raman spectroscopy, DLS is based on elastic electromagnetic scattering of the dispersing particles. The electric field component of laser light waves is interacting with sample molecules by inducing oscillating (point source) electric dipoles within the molecule at the same frequency, resulting in the emission of light. Light is scattered spherically in all directions, while maintaining nearly constant energy of the photons. Most samples of interest for a biochemist, like proteins in solution, are much smaller than the wavelength of the applied DLS laser (<0.1\u03bb) allowing light penetration and isotropic scattering according to the laws of Rayleigh scattering (Barnett 1942) named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. The scattered light is typically not coherent and the spherical waves interfere with each other. The intensity of scattered light I depends on other setup parameters such as the wavelength \u03bb, the scattering angle \u03b8, the distance from the scattering particle s, the refractive index n of the medium and the particle radius r:6.2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$I = I_{0} \\frac{16\\pi^{4}}{\\lambda^{4}}\\frac{1 + { \\cos }^{2}\\theta}{2s^{2}}\\left(\\frac{n^{2} - 1}{n^{2} + 2}\\right)^{2} r^{6}$$\\end{document}I=I016\u03c04\u03bb41+cos2\u03b82s2n2-1n2+22r6\n",

            "text": "The average value of I over all scattering angles is commonly called scattering cross section. The scattering intensity is notably inverse proportional to the forth power of the laser wavelength, which makes a shorter wavelength very attractive for the detection of otherwise weakly scattering molecules. However, an increased intensity of \u201cbackground\u201d reflections of laser light can obviously reduce the sensitivity of the instrument again. Further, the focal lengths of lenses should be shortened as possible, according to I ~ s\u22122. Also probe position and fiber cables should be optimized accordingly. For additional optimization, glass surfaces may be coated with a thin layer of MgF2 or a similar solid material with low refractive index, to minimize reflection of laser light. Further, the light scattering intensity depends on the sixth power of the particle diameter. Consequently, larger particles contribute to the total scattering intensity exponentially more with increasing size, making DLS particularly sensitive for clustering (very large oligomers or unspecific large aggregates) compared to smaller molecules. When the diameter of the particles increases to the size regime of the laser wavelength, the particles create shape dependent anisotropic Mie scattering (referring to the German physicist Gustav Adolf Mie) distorted in forward direction (Mie 1908). One example is sun light scattered by spherical lipid droplets in diluted milk. For particles significantly larger than the wavelength, surface reflection becomes predominant and the scattering cross section, which determines how much light is scattered by the particle, only weakly depends on the light frequency.",

D and subsequently rh values with standard deviations can be directly obtained from the CONTIN algorithm (Provencher 1982), which is solving the inverse Laplace transform of the ACF for the size distribution analysis. As an alternative, a cumulant analysis of the ACF (Frisken 2001) can be applied, which provides polydispersity index (PDI) and the intensity weighted Z-average size value. PDI can express the homogeneity of the radii: For a Gaussian size distribution of a single particle species the width or standard deviation (\u03c3) of an individual rh peak is squared and divided by the square of the mean size to yield the PDI. The distribution of rh values can commonly be weighted by molecular mass, volume, particle number or scattering intensity.",

Also extensive optimization of solution additives or ultra-centrifugation typically helps to minimize polydispersity and undesired peak broadening. High-throughput additive screens for optimization of the solution dispersity are supported by experiments in multi-well plates, which are ideally covered by transparent oil rather than by foils to hinder evaporation of aqueous solutions.

To also ensure that rh is not concentration dependent, typically in an artificial manner, the diffusion constant D can be determined at different concentrations. Those diffusion constants should be evaluated by a Debye plot. A linear dependency of D on the concentration allows to extrapolate D to a value at infinite dilution (unbiased by attractive or repulsive interactions), similar to the extrapolation of size parameters in X-ray scattering data processing. A high correlation value of the ACF at correlation time values of nearly zero (y-axis intercept), which is considered as an essential \u201csignal-to-noise ratio\u201d parameter, will obviously improve the accuracy of the ACF evaluation. However, if the sample concentration is too high or the solution becomes nearly non-transparent, the ACF and the applicability of DLS will suffer from multiple photon scattering. The calculation of an ACF can generally be completed in around 2 s. Nonetheless, static DLS experiments are typically running for 10\u201330 s and are repeated several times for averaging and verification. Scattering intensity data of weakly scattering molecules can to some extend be statistically improved by prolonging the measurement time. Required minimum concentrations heavily depend on several parameters of the instrumentation, most obviously laser intensity and detector sensitivity. Commonly, a monomeric protein of 30\u201340 kDa has a sufficient scattering intensity at concentrations of around 1\u20132 g l\u22121 (or around 50 \u00b5M) in a typical cuvette DLS instrument. For larger proteins the concentration can be reduced according to I ~ r6.\n",

            "text": "Based on the considerations before, DLS is most suitable to study macromolecule degradation, disassembly, homo- and hetero-oligomerization, polymerization (also enzyme-catalyzed), clustering and amplification in real-time. Examples are the pH-dependent dissociation and hydrolysis of Apoferritin (Jaenicke 1987), human prion protein (PrP) aggregation upon specific proteolytic cleavage or UV irradiation (Georgieva et al. 2004; Redecke et al. 2009) stages of protein crystallization (Dierks et al. 2008; Meyer et al. 2012; Oberthuer et al. 2012; Schubert et al. 2017), monitoring density of cell culture (Loske et al. 2014), assembly of lipid nano discs (Petrache et al. 2016) and pharmaceutical kinetics (F\u00e1vero-Retto et al. 2013). For some of these experiments the option to adjust the temperature is essential and also allows to investigate and optimize the thermal stability or assembly of a native biological macromolecule. Figures 6.3 and 6.6 further display DLS data of crystallization processes exemplified by the protein mistletoe lectin I (ML-I) from Viscum album and ferritin. After addition of the precipitant solution larger clusters and nanocrystals are forming while the smaller protein oligomers observed in the beginning are still highly abundant. Typically 2\u20134 major fractions of particles sizes are observed in parallel towards later stages of crystal growth, recognized for different proteins with different solution composition.\n",

However, it is well established that below a critical velocity the ACF of scattering particles for a nearly laminar flow is dominated by Brownian motion and the resulting hydrodynamic radii are consequently not significantly different compared to static samples. The application of DLS under shear flow conditions and in a microfluidic channel, both mathematically and via an initial experimental approach with regard to flow channel dimensions, shear rate, velocity profile of the Poiseuille flow and Doppler shift interferences has been verified (Destremaut et al. 2009). The obtained theoretical approximation of an ACF with some geometrical restrains underlined the applicability of DLS in flow mode. The DLS experiments in this study were performed in a widened channel segment of a microfluidic PDMS chip with dimensions of 500 by 700 \u00b5m. Further stopped-flow DLS experiments have already been performed to study stages of protein folding (Gast et al. 1997) and characterize spherical latex particles in flow utilizing a specific fiber optic laser probe (Leung et al. 2006). This experimental setup is potentially indicating a huge variety of further applications to count and determine the size of macromolecules in place and in flow.",

The applicability of sample solutions in shear flow to DLS is also interesting due to the altered oligomerization, fiber formation or aggregation of protein molecules recognized under shear flow stress, which is still lacking some understanding (Bekard et al. 2011; Dobson et al. 2017).",

The respective data sets can be analyzed by utilizing a particular 3D cross correlation DLS setup (Medebach et al. 2007; Block and Scheffold 2010). It contains a split laser beam, which essentially hits the sample particles typically at two different angles with the same scattering vector. A potential contribution of multiple scattering is expected to vary for the two scattering pattern recorded in parallel, whereas the contribution of single scattering remains constant. Thereby, a cross-correlation of two intensity pattern can identify and suppress multiple scattering. Alternatively, for highly dense colloidal suspensions, gels or biological media, which scatter even stronger, diffusing-wave spectroscopy is most suitable (Zakharov et al. 2006).",

The underlying principle is the quantification of the Doppler effect of the light scattered by particles migrating in the electric field: The light scattered by particles in the direction of migration, i.e. towards the oppositely charged electrode, is upshifted in its frequency, while the frequency in the opposite direction is downshifted.

Moreover, a variety of distinct techniques to complement data based on light scattering is available, including but not limited to Taylor dispersion analysis, microscopic nano particle tracking, SAXS or small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), native mass spectrometry, native gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation or analytical size exclusion chromatography to obtain certain size information of (biological) particles (see for example Boivin et al. 2016). SAXS and SANS as well as electron microscopy techniques or even native ion-mobility mass spectrometry are superior in analyzing the shape of molecules at moderately low resolution in solution, Taylor dispersion analysis is capable of determining the size of small compounds, also <1 kDa, and native mass spectrometry is known for high mass accuracy. However, DLS (and SLS) has huge advantages in terms of sample preparation/consumption, experimental effort, particle size range or instrumental adaptability respectively, especially for long-term time-resolved experiments and in an authentic solution environment for biomolecules. Some of the described in situ DLS instruments can monitor sample volumes around or even below 2 \u00b5l. A strongly curved drop surface for very small solution volumes might hinder the laser alignment in those cases. The option to apply DLS to solutions and suspensions in nearly laminar flow\u2014with some restraints as mentioned\u2014is another mayor benefit in combination with chromatographic purification, automated analytical pipelines and high-throughput or iterative sample analysis.",

Moreover, the applicability of DLS and scattering intensity measurements to hydrogel environments was evaluated (Rochas and Geissler 2014). Dynamic light scattering can also be applied to verify oligomerization and crystallization of Macromolecules in preparation for experiments under microgravity conditions. Studying macromolecular interactions and symmetry under microgravity conditions has always been attractive, e.g. to obtain crystals of superior size, lattice homogeneity and maximized diffraction capability (Drebes et al. 2016). Gels or microfluidic chips, which are \u201cdown to earth\u201d tools to partially mimic microgravity conditions, can be combined with in situ DLS as mentioned before to follow the crystal growth. Further, time-resolved experiments in outer space like at the International Space Station could be monitored by DLS in this context. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration research institute applied a DLS technique to detect clinical eye cataract in an early stage (Ansari et al. 2000).",
