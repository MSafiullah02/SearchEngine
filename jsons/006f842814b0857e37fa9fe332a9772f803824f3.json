Therefore, patients are recommended by national health advisory services to continue with their current treatment to prevent disease flares and practice self-isolation to prevent infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Importantly, both of these behaviours are associated with poor disease-related outcomes (such as high disease activity, pain and fatigue) and cardiometabolic risk factors (such as obesity and insulin resistance) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 2 . Among patients with rheumatic diseases, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and are likely to be exacerbated by physical inactivity and prolonged periods of sitting. Children and adolescents with rheumatic diseases are also commonly hypoactive compared with healthy peers owing to disease manifestations and symptoms and to overprotection by parents and health-care professionals 3 . The negative clinical effects of inactivity for paediatric patients include muscle atrophy and weakness, fatigue, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, reduced physical capacity and function and poor quality of life 3 .",

Sustained physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour are typically associated with poor physical and mental health and increased disease-specific and all-cause mortality risk 4 . Even brief periods of exposure to these behaviours can be deleterious; for example, a 2-week reduction in daily steps from ~10,000 to ~1,500 steps lead to impaired insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, increased visceral fat and decreased fat-free mass and cardiovascular fitness in healthy adults 5 . Interestingly, a bout of moderate-intensity exercise does not counteract the detrimental effects of 4 days of inactivity, suggesting that individuals can become 'resistant' to well-known exercise-induced metabolic adaptations 6 .",

Such evidence has led to the contemporary abrogation of the 'bed rest paradigm' for rheumatic diseases and has guided new approaches to clinical practice that emphasize physical activity as an important part of therapy to improve patients' symptoms 7 . Given that physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour will potentially increase as a function of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with rheumatic diseases who are already hypoactive might be at particular risk of worsened disease activity and symptoms, general comorbidities and poor quality of life (Fig. 1) .",
