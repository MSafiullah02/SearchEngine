Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be valuable especially if performed early, yielding a diagnostic pathogen in 55% of patients [4] . However, because bronchoscopy may cause respiratory deterioration with less than half of them revealing definitive diagnoses, other modalities should be considered for diagnosis of pulmonary infection in HSCT patients. These include noninvasive strategies such as nasopharyngeal washings or swabs sent for immunofluorescence antibody or multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for respiratory viruses and culture, blood cultures, sputum studies, and imaging studies (chest radiography and computed tomography (CT)). During the pre-engraftment phase (0-30 days post-HSCT), the transplant recipient develops defects in mucocutaneous barriers as well as neutropenia, which predisposes to bacterial and fungal (especially Candida) infections. In a study of 427 consecutive allogeneic HSCT recipients, bacterial pneumonia developed in the first post-HCT month in 4%, fungal pneumonia in 9%, and viral pneumonia in 2%; 4% percent of patients who had suspected pneumonia had no specific organism identified [9] . The most common bacterial organisms causing pneumonia were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Community acquired respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and parainfluenza may also cause pulmonary infections, with RSV the most common. Untreated RSV pneumonia is associated with a high mortality (up to 80%). Treatment consists of aerosolized ribavirin and IV immunoglobulin. More recently, influenza A subtype H1N1 infection in HSCT patients was associated with a 28-day mortality rate of 7 and 19% at 4 months post diagnosis [10] .",

Prophylaxis with voriconazole or posaconazole is recommended for HSCT patients who remain neutropenic for >14 days and those on immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD. Screening measures in high risk patients include pretransplant ferritin level >1000 ng/mL, Aspergillus galactomannan, serum beta-d-glucan, or serum Aspergillus PCR testing. Imaging with high resolution chest CT is recommended with radiographic findings such as halo sign (nodule surrounded by ground-glass attenuation), hypodense sign (low density within nodules), and cavitation in late stages suggestive for aspergillosis. Treatment of choice is voriconazole, although there is increased risk of secondary infection with mucormycosis. Failure with voriconazole alone may require treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, combination therapy (echinocandins with voriconazole), or surgical intervention. Despite therapy, survival at 1 year is 20%. Other fungal species such as Zygomycetes (Mucor, Rhizopus), Fusarium, and Scedosporium require surgical resection of localized lesions.

Older patients, positive CMV serology, allogeneic grafts, and GVHD are risk factors. Although ganciclovir has been used for CMV prophylaxis, it causes myelosuppression. Recent studies have shown comparable viral clearance with valganciclovir [4] . The gold standard for diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is by lung tissue biopsy demonstrating viral inclusion bodies. However, CMV may be diagnosed presumptively by PCR testing of blood or bronchoalveolar fluid, clinical symptoms (fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia), and CT imaging demonstrating ground glass attenuation, parenchymal opacification, or innumerable small (<5 mm) nodules. Treatment requires ganciclovir and CMV immunoglobulin. Treatment failure is associated with high mortality (>90%) particularly for those patients who progress to respiratory failure.",

PERDS is attributed to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, IL-8 and IL-6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin that precedes neutrophil engraftment. Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been identified as a risk factor. Major criteria for diagnosis include fever without infectious etiology, rash involving more than 25% total body surface area and pulmonary edema. Minor criteria include hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, weight gain of 2.5% of baseline body weight, and transient encephalopathy. Three major criteria or two major criteria and one minor criterion are typically required for diagnosis. Discontinuation of G-CSF is recommended as well as corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1-1.5 mg/kg/day) for severe cases.

It is hypothesized that DAH is induced by neutrophil infiltration of the lung accentuating alveolar hemorrhage induced by chemotherapy/radiation or occult infection. The diagnosis of DAH is suggested by dyspnea, nonproductive cough, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates of the middle and lower lung zones, and confirmed by progressively bloody BAL fluid samples from three separate lung subsegments [4] .

            "text": "Noninfectious pulmonary complications in the late posttransplant phase include bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) especially in those patients with chronic GVHD [4] . Bronchiolitis obliterans occurs mainly in allogeneic transplant recipients, with an average incidence of 8%. Risk factors for BO include progressive chronic GVHD, age >20 years, prior evidence of airflow obstruction, respiratory infections, unrelated donor, total body irradiation >12 Gy, low pretransplant serum surfactant D protein level, and NOD2/CARD15 genetic polymorphism. Several pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested including lung injury caused by conditioning regimens, injury secondary to infectious etiology, recurrent aspirations-microaspirations or due to esophagitisassociated GVHD, or donor T cells targeting epithelial cells of bronchioles, leading to inflammation and damage. The majority of patients report dry cough and wheezing. Up to 25% experience upper respiratory tract symptoms; conversely, 20% of patients are initially asymptomatic. Diagnosis is made based on clinical characteristics, chest CT findings (air trapping, hyperinflation, ground-glass opacities), pulmonary function tests (PFTs) demonstrating new onset airflow obstruction, and no evidence of infection (including negative BAL). Biopsy is generally discouraged as the disease is patchy and peripheral, and samples may not show pathology. Patients may experience slow progression with occasional exacerbations. Some patients may develop recurrent respiratory infections and colonization with Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus, while others may progress rapidly to respiratory failure within a few months. Treatment is aimed at slowing and stabilizing the disease with recommendations based on small trials and expert opinions. Generally, high dose corticosteroids are given; adjunctive therapies include augmentation of immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, and potentially macrolides. Promising new directions include use of inhaled corticosteroids, extracorporeal photodynamic therapy, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies. Lung transplantation has been successful in a minority of patients. Mortality is 18% at 10 years, whereas attributable mortality in those with GVHD is 40% at 10 years. Age over 60 years, progressive chronic GVHD, disease relapse, respiratory viral infections, and rapid deterioration of PFTs are associated with higher mortality [5, 6] .",

Clinical presentation includes fever, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Diagnosis is made by clinical characteristics, radiography showing patchy peripheral consolidations/ground glass opacities, PFTs with restrictive pattern with no airflow obstruction, decreased diffusing capacity, and negative infectious workup including negative BAL.

In the event an unfavorable outcome is expected, transition to palliative care measures should be discussed with these patients and their families early in the ICU course.
