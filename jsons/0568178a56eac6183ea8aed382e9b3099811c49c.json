If this new trend continues at this pace, I hope that the number of confirmed cases could decline by next week. However, will this plague go away as easily as we would want it to be? If the third tide comes back, all hope is gone and the vicious cycle begins again.",

However, what if the coronavirus that comes back is not the same as the previous one and, therefore, we are not ready for the immunity against it? Nightmares begin again. It's even worse.",

Although the rally of religion, politics, and fellowship is now banned, the possibility of another outbreak is minimized, but there is still a trigger. I think there are two main types. One is an outbreak from a school, the other is from a nursing home or a long-term care facility (I will exclude a cruise ship because at least it can be quarantined at sea). The former will not need any further explanation and, above all, the latter is more concerned. In the former case, healthy young people are the main members, but in the latter the people have lots of handicaps such as old age and underlying chronic diseases. Rather, even now, although small and intermittent, news of a few outbreaks at a nursing home or long-term care facilities is being heard. What if this explodes on a massive scale?",

However, if a new wave by mutants begins in China, we will have to seriously discuss the restriction of entry from China again. As we have already been greatly affected by this plague, I think we should ban immigration from China to prevent further spread at that time.",
