            "text": "COVID-19 or the novel coronavirus is a rapidly spreading global pandemic, which as of April 14, 2020 has affected about 2.1 million people and claimed over 126,000 deaths globally (Johns Hopkins, 2020). After originating in Wuhan, China, it led to a massive loss of life and work in European countries such as Italy, France, and Spain. While there is no treatment available, the focus has been to contain the spread through national lockdowns and quarantines (Hamzelou, 2020). The current epicenter of COVID-19 is the US with over 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths till April 14, 2020, with a rate of increase in reported new cases of over 30,000/day. While China has been able to effectively control the spread since the end of Feb, 2020 (Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020), the entire world has the eyes on the second most populated country, India, which houses about 17.7% of the world population. Till 14th April, there has been a total of 11,490 cases and 398 reported deaths all over India, with increase in reported new cases of over 1000/day. This worsening situation warrants immediate study of the emerging evidence and patterns about the disease to contain it effectively, and to also be prepared for future outbreaks.",

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that the spread of COVID-19 is expected to be more in the cold and temperate climate as compared to the warm and tropical climate, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory flu virus (Bloom-Feshbach et al., 2013). Multiple viruses from the Coronaviridae family, including the SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV, also demonstrate seasonality and preference for low temperature and humidity (Casanova et al., 2010). The stability of SARS CoV-2, which is responsible for COVID-19, has been reported to be similar to that of SARS CoV-1 on various types of inanimate surfaces in specific weather conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2020). Sajadi et al. (2020) investigated the average monthly temperature and relative humidity in different parts of the world from Nov, 2019 to end of Feb, 2020 and observed the spread mainly in the countries lying in between latitudes 30\u201350\u00b0 North, and having relatively similar weather patterns (temperature in the range of 5\u201311 \u00b0C and relative humidity in the range of 47\u201379%). In another study, Oliveiros et al. (2020) investigated the effect of temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed on the rate of COVID-19 spread in China between Jan 23 to Mar 1, 2020. The rate of increase and doubling time of the number of cases were determined and compared with the weather variables using linear regression analysis. The results indicated that the doubling time of the number of cases was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with humidity. However, these correlation values were very low (R2 < 0.18) to draw any strong conclusion. Precipitation and wind speed were found to exhibit no correlation with the doubling time of the number of cases. Bukhari and Jameel (2020) studied the effect of humidity and temperature on the emerging worldwide cases of COVID-19 between Jan 20 and Mar 19, 2020. The results indicated absolute humidity (AH) to be a better metric than relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T) to study the spread. It was also observed that 90% of the new cases until 21 Mar 2020 had occurred within a specific range of AH (4 to 9 g/m3) and T (3 to 17 \u00b0C). While this information on the global trend is valuable, to date, no relationships between weather and COVID-19 spread have been established for any specific country. Further studies at the local level may help improve our understanding on the realistic effect of weather on the viral spread.",

We characterized the distribution of new cases reported between Jan 1 and Apr 9, 2020 across all US states marked with varying daily weather parameters. Through statistical analysis, we were able to identify the vulnerable ranges of weather parameters and validate them for different time intervals, and against worldwide findings. Using our results, we predicted the risky states in India, which could possibly be more vulnerable for the transmission of COVID-19 in the recent and upcoming months in 2020. We anticipate our findings to not only be beneficial to the policymakers in US and India, but also countries which are going to experience vulnerable weather conditions in 2020, to prepare medically, socially, and financially against mass spreading of COVID-19.",

These specific ranges were selected based on earlier claims of weather based worldwide spread (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020), and to compare our results with existing literature (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020). The vulnerable ranges of AH (in g/m3) and T (in \u00b0C), which led to the highest number of new cases, were identified and compared with worldwide trends. Based on our findings, AH was employed as a superior prediction metric, and its relationship with the monthly average number of new cases was studied across all US states, to understand if the time interval of studied parameters has any effect on the weather and spread relationship. Finally, the vulnerable AH range determined for the US states was used to predict which Indian states would be more vulnerable for the transmission of the disease. The available and projected AH and T data of each Indian state was averaged over each month starting Jan 1, 2020 and ending Dec 31, 2020, and the vulnerable states across 12 months in 2020 were identified.",

A majority of the Indian states were reported, based on the available and projected weather data, to experience AH > 9 g/m3 throughout 2020. In Jan, 2020, the states namely Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan were found to lie in the ranges of 3 < AH < 4 g/m3, 4 < AH < 5 g/m3, 6 < AH < 7 g/m3, and 7 < AH < 8 g/m3 respectively. Chandigarh and Haryana were in the same range of 8 < AH < 9 g/m3. Based on the vulnerable AH range identified for the US, Jammu and Kashmir was found to be the only Indian state to lie in such a range. Going from Jan, 2020 to Feb, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir was still found to be in the vulnerable AH range of 4 to 6 g/m3. Also, Sikkim stayed within 3 < AH < 4 g/m3. Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan were found to move to an 8 < AH < 9 g/m3 range, and the new state Gujrat also lied in this same range. In Mar, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir moved to 6 < AH < 7 g/m3 range and Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan still lied in 8 < AH < 9 g/m3 range. However, Sikkim moved from previous 3 < AH < 4 g/m3 range into vulnerable 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 range. In Apr, 2020, none of the states were projected to be in the vulnerable 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 range. In May 2020, except Sikkim, all other states will experience AH > 9 g/m3. In Jun, 2020 through Sep, 2020, AH across all Indian states are expected to be above 9 g/m3. In Oct, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir is again expected to come back to 8 < AH < 9 g/m3 range, and Sikkim to 6 < AH < 7 g/m3 range. Further in Nov, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir will be again in vulnerable 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 range along with Sikkim. Finally, in Dec, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir will stay in vulnerable 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 range and Sikkim will move to AH < 3 g/m3 range. As the total new cases reported, as of Apr 9, 2020, in India are low (i.e., 6725) and majorly in states with AH > 9 (e.g., Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu), we did not attempt to identify any relationship between AH and new cases within the study timeline.",

In the US, once the number of new cases in a 10-day interval went over 10,000, the majority of the cases were found to be reported in states experiencing absolute humidity (AH) in a narrow range of 4 to 6 g/m3, and temperature (T) in a wider range of 4 \u00b0C\u201311 \u00b0C. Considering AH as a better parameter than T to study the relationship between weather and COVID-19 spread, we found that the vulnerable 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 range for 10-day intervals were generalizable to monthly study intervals. Also, our results lied within the literature reported AH ranges worldwide (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; Chan et al., 2011). Assuming the US model to represent the world findings, we classified risky Indian states with expected 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 through all months of 2020.",

The vulnerable ranges identified in the current study lie within these ranges. In another study by Bukhari and Jameel (2020), majority of the new cases around the world were found to be in countries with 3 \u00b0C < T < 17 \u00b0C and 4 < AH < 9 g/m3.
