Thereafter, the cells were labeled with the Catchmatrix Reagent containing bispecific antibodies for CD45 and IFN-\u03b3, which was secreted by the stimulated target cells during the secretion period. After the secretion phase, the cell surface-bound IFN-\u03b3 was targeted by the Enrichment Reagent, which contained IFN-\u03b3-specific antibody conjugated to superparamagnetic iron dextran particles (MACS\u00ae MicroBeads), thus allowing subsequent immunomagnetic cell separation. The unlabeled cells (CCS negative fraction) passed through the built-in magnetic column, whereas the Microbead-labeled cells (CCS positive fraction) were retained in the magnetic field. Afterwards, the magnetic field was turned off and the target cells were eluted into the target cell bag. The entire process took only 12 hours for cell manufacturing.",

            "text": "In the majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, severe lymphopenia developed (lymphocyte count <0.8\u00d710 9 /L), which correlated with disease severity; 6-9 thus, candidates for adoptive T cell therapy may not require lymphodepleting preparative chemotherapy. Nevertheless, bidirectional alloreactivity is a concern. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the CCS enriched product is depleted of na\u00efve T cells, thereby limiting the risk of GVHD. In previous studies of HLA-mismatched virus-specific T-cell therapy, GVHD was not a barrier, 10-12 as the clinically effective dose was as little as 5x10 3 virus-specific T cells/kg, which was considerably lower than the clinical threshold for GVHD. For the T cells to be effective for virus control, they must act fast before complete donor-cell rejection. In this regard, the CCS system selects functionally rather than phenotypically and preferentially enriches those T cells that can secrete IFN\u03b3 within hours after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides by the nature of memory recall response. In contrast, de novo alloreactivity takes several days to develop, and could be longer in severely lymphopenic patients with severe COVID-19. Phenotypically, the CCS isolated cells are enriched for CD56+ T cells, CD4+ TEM cells, and CD8+ TEM and TEMRA cells, all of which are known to have potent and rapid pathogen response (thus captured preferentially by the CCS system). 5, 13, 14 For pandemics caused by novel pathogens, development of specific vaccines for active immunization takes time; however, passive immunity can be acquired immediately via blood component transfusion from recovered patients. In this regard, promising preliminary data have been reported on the use of plasma therapy for COVID-19. 3 Conceivably, our adoptive Tcell therapy approach can be easily combined with plasma infusion from the same donor or different donor. T cells are a \"living drug\" and can expand in vivo, which is in contrast pharmacokinetically to antibody, of which the level universally drops after infusion because of consumption or natural metabolism. Accordingly, a unit of donor's blood may potentially treat more patients and the therapeutic effects of T cells may be more durable than that of plasma therapy. For a dose of 5x10 3 SARS-CoV-2 T cells/kg, the cells from the donor with mild symptoms could provide sufficient cells for 3 adult recipients; correspondingly, the donor with severe symptoms could potentially benefit as many as 6 recipients. Pharmacodynamically, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells may be used alone or synergistically with plasma therapy to establish immediately an adaptive immune status mimicking that after successful vaccination. Under the protection of adaptive immunity, the body will not depend solely on innate immune .

[15] [16] [17] Coronavirusspecific T cells have been shown to be crucial for virus clearance and may dampen further damage to the lung by the dysregulated, overactive innate immunity. [17] [18] [19] [20] For the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells to be effective, the donor cells must share some HLA with the recipient for proper viral antigen presentation to the donor TCRs. Previous studies have demonstrated that viral-specific T cells from donors who shared only one HLA were efficacious. 21 With just two random donors, we estimated that more than 90% of the Singapore Chinese population will share at least one HLA allele with the manufactured cells (Supplemental Table 2 ), 22, 23 suggesting that our approach is feasible for both small-scale and large-scale, off-the-shelf delivery model and manufacture-on-demand model with simple ethnic-group matching. 24 In 2018, Chinese made up 74.3% of the Singapore population. Our future goal will include recruiting some Malay and Indian donors into the pool as their ethnic groups constitute the other 13.4% and 9.0% of the Singapore population, respectively. 25 This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; therefore, product variability and clinical utility of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells have yet to be determined. Nevertheless, we provide fundamental first proof-of-principle data herein demonstrating that it is feasible to produce clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use. These virus-specific T cells can be isolated from the blood of convalescent donors rapidly and efficiently using SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides and an automated medical device which is commonly available worldwide. The entire tubing-set is a closed system and thus reduces the requirements for cleanroom in lower-income regions. Extending from therapeutics to diagnostics, our data showing that virus-specific T cells can be detected easily after brief stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides suggest that a diagnostic assay can be developed, particularly for patients similar to Donor 2 who had mild symptoms and might gone undiagnosed without a history of family contact.",
