However, this is based on a number of small studies from China in women who developed mild COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, in which the majority were delivered via caesarean section.(2,6,7,11) It is unknown whether vaginal birth or uterine contraction increases the risk of mother to child transmission.(4,7,11) Similarly, the effects of the virus on the foetus in the first and second trimester or in patients with moderate-to-severe infection is unknown.(2,4,7) In one study in Wuhan, one newborn tested positive in 36 h of life \u2013 there is uncertainty if the newborn acquired the disease postnatally or perinatally.(12)",

A rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines, as well as ongoing education, should diminish anxiety amongst health-care workers.(27) Ongoing refinement of protocols and procedures is warranted as the extent of the pandemic in our setting unfolds and the available literature changes. These should happen concurrently while still delivering appropriate care to the current and future patients within the unit. South Africa is a low-to-middle income country, and the lack of resources available means we cannot increase our capacity, staffing numbers or available equipment.
