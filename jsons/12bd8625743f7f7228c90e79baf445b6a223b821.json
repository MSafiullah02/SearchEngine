Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a product derived from the plasma of thousands of donors used for treatment of primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, neuroimmunologic disorders, and infectionrelated sequelae. IVIG provides passive immune protectio n against a broad range of pathogens. Hyperimmune globulin, in contrast, is derived from individuals with high antibody titers to specific pathogens and has been used successfully in the treatment of infections, such as cytomegalovirus and H1N1 influenza. Here, we review the mechanism and utility of IVIG and hyperimmune globulin in viral infections, and consider their usage in COVID-19 infection (Table 1) .",

The S protein forms a homotrimer that protrudes from the viral surface. Receptor binding is mediated by the S 1 subunit through the receptor binding J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f domain (RBD). After binding to the ACE2 receptor, proteolytic activation of the S 2 subunit mediates the fusion between the viral and the cellular membranes(1). Due to the essential role of S glycoprotein in cellular infection, antibodies that bind to S 1 and S 2 can prevent infection (Fig. 1) , as demonstrated in cell cultures by incubating virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody and quantitating reduction in viral intracellular RNA levels (2) . A neutralizing antibody can stop viral replication by blocking receptor binding, preventing wall fusion, or preventing uncoating of the virus once inside the cytoplasm.",

Additionally, the presence of IgG dimers in IVIG may block activating Fc\uf067R on innate immune effector cells(11) (Fig. 1 ). There is a case series on IVIG usage The study suggests that IVIG led to significant improvement in leukocyte and platelet counts, but acknowledges that there was no control group to objectively evaluate responses (14) . A single center retrospective study in Singapore found that adult SARS patients treated with a regimen of pulse methylprednisolone (400 mg) and IVIG (0.4 mg/kg) daily for three consecutive days had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.41 for mortality compared to the untreated group, with a trend towards earlier recovery. However, this finding was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.14-1.23; P=0.11). Furthermore, this result was confounded by the concurrent use of steroids (15) . There are two case reports of IVIG used in MERS. One patient received IVIG with high-dose corticosteroids due to thrombocytopenia, with resulting improvement in platelet count. Similar to the previous study, there was concurrent steroid use and, moreover, the patient's overall clinical co urse is unknown (16) . Thus, the field lacks strong evidence to support the use of IVIG for the treatment of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS.",

There is an urgent need for effective interventions presently. Performing a randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm in the midst of a deadly pandemic is extremely challenging. Until herd immunity develops against SARS-CoV-2, preferably by means of effective vaccines, the global population will remain at risk. Past experience has demonstrated that vaccine development needs to be performed cautiously to avoid potential exacerbation of disease (i.e. ADE). Use of hyperimmune globulin has demonstrated clear effectiveness in the treatment of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

            "text": "Evaluation of serum from MERS-CoV patients demonstrated that high antibody titers against MERS-CoV were only likely to be present in patients who had severe disease and those titers waned within six months following recovery. Mild or asymptomatic patients with MERS exhibited no serologic response(4). These observations demonstrate the importance of verifying high antibody titers in potential convalescent serum donors. Some cross-reactivity was observed in five patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV in vitro, but not with other coronaviruses, have begun to characterize the antibody response seen in patients with COVID-19. To et al. evaluated serum antibody responses in 23 SARS-CoV-2 patients in Hong Kong. The majority of patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG 10 days after symptom onset and 100% of patients were positive for anti -RBD IgG 14 days following symptom onset. Severe disease was associated with earlier production and higher titer of anti-RBD IgG(5). More recently, the kinetics of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were described in 285 patients with COVID-19. In this cohort, the median time required for the development of anti-viral IgG and IgM was 13 days after the start of symptoms, and all patients developed anti-viral IgG within 19 days(6). While there was over a four-fold log difference found in the anti-viral IgG levels among patients, there was no correlation between anti-viral IgG levels and clinical outcome measures (lymphocyte numbers, C reactive protein levels, or duration of hospitalization)(6). As neutralization activity of the anti-viral antibodies was not tested, variability in antibody effectiveness may have contributed to the lack of correlation between anti-viral IgG and clinical outcomes(6). The use of seroconversion as a biomarker of acquired anti-viral immunity requires determination of the antibody levels indicative of prior infection(7-10). Serial antibody testing during the course of COVID-19 infection in 41 patients within this cohort revealed that 71% either seroconverted or demonstrated a four-fold increase in IgG-specific antibody titers, meeting the established criteria for serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection(6). As it is infeasible to test all individuals throughout the course of COVID-19, further evaluation of immune J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f responses in asymptomatic, mild, and severe SARS-CoV-2-infected patients will be needed to quantify the levels and persistence of antibody titers that confer anti-viral immunity. Recently, Quniti and colleagues in Italy have reported their experience with COVID-19 infection in seven patients with primary immunodeficiency, two with X-linked agammaglobulinemia and five with common variable immune deficiency (CVID), genetic diagnoses unknown (Article in Press, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.013). All patients were maintained on IVIG. Interestingly, both agammaglobulinemia patients had mild disease of short duration. In contrast, all five CVID patient had more severe, prolonged COVID -19 infection with four patients requiring mechanical ventilation and one death. CVID patients were noted to have more comorbidities. Although the experience is quite limited, the milder course in the agammaglobulinemia patients suggests antibodies or B cells may aggravate COVID-19 infection. Alternatively, CVID",

The patients received IVIG at 0.3-0.4g/kg/day for 5 days. They all had normalization of temperature within two days of treatment, and alleviation of respiratory symptoms within five days. Confounding factors include the concurrent usage of antivirals in two of the three patients and steroids in one patient, as well as the lack of case-matched control patients(12). While the recovery of these patients is encouraging, it is important to consider the difficulty of performing adequately controlled studies in the early days of a deadly pandemic.The use of IVIG has been reported in the treatment of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. A systematic review of treatment effects in SARS patients, including IVIG or convalescent plasma, has been reported. Five studies of the use of IVIG or convalescent plasma given in addition to corticosteroids and ribavirin were evaluated. These studies were deemed inconclusive since the effects of IVIG or convalescent plasma could not be distinguished from other factors that included comorbidities, stage of illness, and the effect of other treatments(13). In a single-center prospective study of SARS infection in Taiwan, IVIG was administered for leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, or if there was rapid progression of disease on radiography. A total J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of 40 patients received IVIG, of whom 22 had severe cytopenias, with one patient having evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",

            "text": "Similarly, antibodies against the S protein of a coronavirus may facilitate entry into host cells, likely through the Fc\uf067R, resulting in increased viral loads. Wan et al demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against MERS-CoV can bind viral S protein, inducing a conformational change that promotes proteolytic activation of the S protein and viral entry. Further, the mAb was also able to mediate viral entry through uptake by Fc\uf067R(21). Recently, animal models evaluating SARS-CoV infection in macaques has J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f demonstrated that antibodies against the S protein can activate Fc\uf067R in M2 macrophages in the lung, triggering an exaggerated inflammatory response with the release of large quantities of IL-6 and IL-8, recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung,leading to acute lung injury (ALI), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and death(22). This model recapitulates the lung damage observed in lung tissue of deceased SARSinfected patients. In fact, plasma derived from these patients has been shown to trigger release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages. This process was blocked using anti-Fc\uf067R antibodies, implicating this Fc\uf067R-mediated pathway in ALI and DAD.",

Additionally, antibody-bound virus can be internalized through Fc\u03b3 receptors, enhancing viral replication.
