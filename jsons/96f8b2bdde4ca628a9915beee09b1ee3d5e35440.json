To analyze the linkage between LDV envelope proteins, M/VP-2 and VP-3, which may play an important role in viral infectivity, we generated specific antibody against M/VP-2 that has not been reported in previous studies. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of LDV strain C (LDV-C) ORF6, which encodes M/VP-2, was chemically synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The peptide was immunogenic in rabbits and induced antibody specific for viral protein. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis of virion M/VP-2 in infected macrophages showed that the antibody was able to react specifically with authentic virion protein. The immunoreactive antibody against LDV M/VP-2 described in this study will be useful for further studies of the specific roles of the envelope proteins in arterivirus assembly and infectivity. q R\u00e9sum\u00e9 L'explication de la structure antig\u00e9nique des prot\u00e9ines d'enveloppe des Arteriviridae, dont le virus de la lacticod\u00e9hydrog\u00e9nase (LDV) fait partie, devrait permettre de mieux comprendre le m\u00e9canisme de la stricte sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 des cellules h\u00f4tes. Pour analyser les liens entre les prot\u00e9ines d'enveloppe du LDV, \u00e0 savoir M/VP-2 et VP-3, qui jouent certainement un r\u00f4le important dans le pouvoir infectant du virus, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un anti-corps sp\u00e9cifique de la M/VP-2 dont il n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention dans les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.

L'anticorps immunor\u00e9actif avec la M/VP-2 du LDV d\u00e9crit dans cette \u00e9tude va s'av\u00e9rer utile dans les \u00e9tudes qui vont \u00eatre conduites sur le r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cifique des prot\u00e9ines d'enveloppe dans l'Arteriviridae et dans son pouvoir infectant. q",

The larger protein is a primary envelope glycoprotein (VP-3; encoded by ORF5) that is generally heterogenous in size (25 -40 kDa) due to varying amounts of glycosylation [4] . Li et al. [5] have postulated that LDV VP-3 may be the virus attachment protein. Their studies have shown that the neutralization epitope is located in the very short ectodomain of the primary envelope glycoprotein, and that the epitope is associated with polylactosaminoglycan chains, which may affect the binding of neutralizing antibodies to the LDV virions.",

Since breakage of the disulfide bond(s) in virions resulted in a loss of viral infectivity, the linkage between M/VP-2 and VP-3 seems to be required for host cell entry, perhaps by generating the virion receptor attachment site. Further analysis of the functional properties of VP-3-M/VP-2 heterodimer envelope proteins of LDV will require antibodies directed specifically against each envelope protein. Although much effort has been invested toward the generation of several specific antibodies against LDV VP-3 [7] , almost no antibodies that react consistently with virion M/VP-2 have been produced in studies using various immunological methods of analysis such as immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. It has been reported that anti-LDV antibodies raised in mice to peptides of ORF6 protein weakly immunoprecipitated in vitro-synthesized ORF6 protein, but even these antibodies did not consistently react with virion M/VP-2 [8] . As a first step to examine the biological and functional properties of LDV M/VP-2, we prepared newly generated specific antibody against LDV ORF6.",

For this reason, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the LDV-C ORF6 protein was screened according to Hopp and Woods method [10] for predicting an antigenic region on the basis of hydrophilicity plots. A peptide H 2 N-CVLGGKKAVSKG-COOH, corresponding to the residue sequence 151-161 in the C-terminal region of LDV-C ORF6 protein, had an extra cysteine-NH 2 residue on the N-terminus; this residue was added to allow coupling to the carrier, and was chosen and synthesized by the solid phase method based on Fmoc-chemistry [11] following carrier conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as described in a report by Liu et al.

However, in spite of successful production of the specific antibody against virion M/VP-2 achieved in this study, obtaining specific antibodies against M/VP-2 has been very difficult. Other researchers have reported similar difficulties; for example, Coutelier et al. [18] were unable to detect an anti-M/VP-2 response in infected mice, despite a strong response to VP-3. Moreover, in another study, antisera consistently reactive to virion M/VP-2 were not obtained by immunization of animals with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated synthetic peptides against the C-terminal region of ORF6 protein, which was the same antigenic site chosen in this study [8] . Failure in generating such antibodies may have been due to the immunization methods. It has been reported that KLH and BSA may activate cell mediators such as antigen-presenting cells by different mechanisms due to their respective sizes and their capacities to concentrate in lymphoid centers [19] . Previous study has also shown that peptides coupled with KLH could mimic epitopes present on the native protein structure more accurately than they could those coupled to BSA, with the result that peptides coupled to KLH more efficiently stimulated the immune response [20] . In the same study, it was also reported that plasma raised from peptide coupled to KLH reacted with MHV spike glycoprotein, as shown by Western blotting, whereas the plasma raised from BSA-conjugated peptide reacted only with carrier protein or with spike glycoprotein and carrier protein. A more likely explanation for the difficulty in production of anti-peptide antisera against LDV ORF6 protein may be that linear epitopes do not form a significant part of the antigenic structure, and that conformationdependent epitopes predominate.",
