Some monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, receptor inhibitors, and growth factors may preferably induce acute, violent, early events with an overall low frequency, but with serious and life-threatening capacity. In fact, these reactions represent one of the major limitations to therapeutic efficacy of this new set of drugs. Different mechanisms of action, only partially known, are implicated in the various syndromes, although most of them may be related to highly specific receptor targeting causing immediate massive release of specific factors, such as in the cytokine release syndrome, or of intracellular active components of neoplastic cells, such as in the tumor lysis syndrome.",

Later on, it has been related to cytokines' action on vascular permeability and identified also as vascular leak syndrome (VLS) [2] . In its acute phase (leak phase), up to 70 % of plasma is extravasated. Prodromic signs such as malaise, weight gain, fatigue, weakness and myalgia may occur; pyrexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting may follow. The Leak phase is characterized by prolonged hypotension, edema (face, trunk, extremities) hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, oliguria, thirst, and cool skin. Complications such as ischemia, renal failure, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and rhabdomyolysis may also occur at this stage. During the postleak phase, symptoms revert rapidly; fluids are recruited into circulation and diuresis increases; the massive fluid rebound induces diffuse visceral edema, usually not present in the leak phase. Therefore, pulmonary edema and cardiopulmonary failure are the consequent complications during the postleak phase. Their severity and frequency may be influenced by the usual high volumes of fluids administered during the leak phase to compensate extravasation.",

Endothelial injury and apoptosis or cell retraction have been suggested on the basis of morphological and functional studies, although not conclusive. The vascular damage may involve activation of endothelial cells and leukocytes, intercellular adhesion, and most importantly the massive release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Their effect greatly increases vascular permeability allowing fluids, proteins, and electrolytes to flow into interstitial spaces, producing edema, hypoxia, and multiple organ failures (mainly pulmonary, cardiac, and renal). Therefore, multifactorial mechanisms have been postulated as: (1) initial toxic effects on vascular endothelium integrity; (2) activation of endothelial cells and leukocytes; (3) additional secretion of cytokines and inflammatory mediators consequent to cell activation; (4) increased damage by activated leukocytes and secondary reaction of newly formed mediators [3] [4] [5] .",

Although initially observed after mouse-derived mAbs infusions, more frequently as mild to moderate reactions, subsequent and prolonged experimentation encountered dramatic consequences, even with fully humanized mAbs [9, 12, 13] . Candidate targets able to induce CRS are those widely diffused on T cells (CD3, CD52), CD20, activated T cells (CD25), B cells (CD20), and monocytes (CD52). However, not all biomedicines are associated with CRS. For example, basiliximab is considered as a low inducer of CRS because it targets the IL-2Ra chain lacking the capacity of intracellular signaling and therefore being not able to burst violent cytokine releases, such as those causing CRS. Alternatively, some biomedicines may induce less typical reactions reported in anecdotal episodes and in the postmarketing settings yet not identified as CRS.",

Therefore, intercellular binding and/or additional releases of other CRS-inducing factors from tumor cells might play additional roles in CRS manifestation, particularly when a high burden of specific tumor targets are involved. Major effects were seen in releasing TNF-a and IL-6 in the presence of EpCAM-positive tumor cells, with a smaller activity on IL-2 and a nonsignificant action on IL-12 and IL-1. In this case, no histamine release or complement activation was observed during experiments, thus indicating the exclusive role of cytokines in the development of typical CRS. Altogether, the in vitro cytokine release stimulation on effector cells and the protective effect exerted by some corticosteroids in the same in vitro assay are a further proof-of-concept of mAbmediated CRS pathogenesis and of the efficacy of steroid (pre) medication in mitigating its effects in vivo.",

However, some of these agents, such as IL-2 and anti-CD3 (muromonab) or CD20 (ibritumomab, ofatumumab, rituximab, and tositumomab), have the capacity of activating their target cells soon after therapy initiation and before destroying them. Therefore, in the presence of relevant tumor burdens with high cell turnover, such as T cell lymphomas and acute leukemia, they may cause, although infrequently, a ''double storm'' in sequence, first through massive cytokine release (CRS) and then by vast tumor cell lysis (TLS). Very rarely, as documented for example during antiCD52 (alemtuzumab) therapy, CLS, CRS, and TLS can follow like incoming shock waves.",

The etiology of noninfectious forms is unknown. Genetic defects in T and NK cells cytotoxicity, the latter related to perforin deficiency encountered especially in SJIA, have been identified. High levels of macrophage stimulating (M-CSF, IFNc, and MCP-1), or macrophage-derived (IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFa) cytokines, and of T-derived products (IL-2 and IL-2R) are usually present, while IL-1 is not always elevated, although its role in developing the syndrome is revealed by beneficial effects of IL-1 antagonist, such as anakinra. However, a number of iatrogenic inducers/boosters have been suspected, such as acetylsalicylic acid and other NSAIDs, gold salts, sulfasalazine, and biomedicines with high capacity of cytokine release, including TNF-a releasers. Interestingly, the latter seems to play an additional role in dyscoagulative disorders [28] [29] [30] [31] . Cases of MAS or exacerbation of underlying states of HPS, including cytopathic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) have been reported after treatment with etanercept, rilonacept, tocilizumab, anakinra, and alemtuzumab [32, 33] . However, a direct relation between treatment and MAS induction is not always evident. For example, in cases where MAS was associated to alemtuzumab a reactivation of EBV and CMV viruses occurred, thus indicating a possible immunosuppressive effect of the biomedicine as an indirect cause of MAS activation. In other clinical situations, such as after anakinra treatment, the agents seemed to ameliorate MAS, but in other occasions they acted as inducers of macrophage activation. In one case of CHP evolving into a severe HLH with elevated circulating IFNc, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-18, but also of the antiinflammatory IL-10, etanercept was partially effective, yet produced aphasia and hemiparalysis that resolved after treatment discontinuation [34] . The subsequent treatment with anakinra was very effective in controlling the syndrome. Such biomedicine was equally effective in Still's disease and SJIA, but in other cases of JIA failed or led to induction of MAS [35] [36] [37] . It must be stated that anecdotal reported cases of similar conditions are difficult to compare per se. Observations during controlled studies are rare and often refer to different clinical situations.",
