With high divergence in sequence due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, HCV is classified into 7 phylogenetic clades designated from genotype 1 through 7, with more than 30% divergence based on nucleotide sequences and over 70 subtypes within an individual genotype (Simmonds, 2013, Simmonds et al., 2005). Chronic HCV infection is estimated to affect about 170 million people worldwide or ~3% of the world\u2019s population (Lavanchy, 2009). In addition, there are 3 to 4 million new yearly infected cases coupled with 350,000 patients dying from HCV-related diseases (Shepard et al., 2005, WHO, 2012). Despite the fact that HCV was identified over two decades ago, there is still no therapeutic vaccine for HCV infection and treatment regimen for chronic infections are limited with various serious side effects as well as high treatment cost (EASL, 2011, Hayashi and Takehara, 2006). Thus, identification and discovery of new, innovative, and effective treatment is highly desirable in order to curb the spread of HCV.",

The ORF is translated into a precursor polyprotein of approximately 3000 residues which is then co- and post-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases into at least three structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), a small ion channel protein (p7), and six non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (Lin et al., 1994, Lindenbach et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Although ample studies suggest a strong tie between chronic HCV infection and liver damage, the mechanisms involved are still not well established. A combination of viral cytopathic effects (CPE) and host immune responses are believed to contribute to the liver injury observed in HCV infection (Guicciardi and Gores, 2005, Park et al., 2012). While HCV is not a cytolytic virus, studies have demonstrated that hepatocyte apoptosis plays a major part in the host anti-viral defense mechanism against HCV as it prevents viral replication as well as aids in the elimination of virus-infected hepatocytes (Lim et al., 2012). Similarly, a number of recent studies using the HCV cell culture (HCVcc) system (Lindenbach et al., 2005) have shown that HCV can have direct CPE and induce cell death in the form of apoptosis in hepatocytes (Deng et al., 2008, Mateu et al., 2008, Mohd-Ismail et al., 2009, Walters et al., 2009, Zhu et al., 2007). It is believed that HCV modulates host apoptosis by interacting with a couple of host factors. Ectopic expression of the individual viral proteins in cell culture as well as using the subgenomic replicon system, have shed more light on the contributions of the individual viral genes to host apoptosis (see review (Aweya and Tan, 2011)). For instance, using a NS3-5B subgenomic replicon, Lan et al. (2008) showed that the HCV non-structural proteins are key modulators which sensitize human hepatoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Similarly, data from our laboratory have previously demonstrated that the HCV core protein is pro-apoptotic and a novel BH3-only viral homologue (Mohd-Ismail et al., 2009) while more recent data demonstrated that the small ion channel protein, p7, induces apoptosis in Huh7.5 cells in a caspase-dependent manner involving both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (Aweya et al., 2013). As the various HCV-encoded proteins play a different role in modulating host apoptosis by interacting and interfering with different host factors and/or cellular events, understanding how this intricate host-viral interaction is regulated so as to prevent premature death of infected cells and to establish persistent infection would be essential in understanding the disease pathogenesis and for instituting an effective treatment regimen.",

Using an apoptosis-specific PCR array, we successfully identified 9 apoptosis-related genes that were differentially expressed during HCV infection. Of the 9 genes, BIK, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein of the Bcl-2 family, was consistently up-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level. Depletion of BIK using small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not affect the growth of Huh7.5 cells but significantly decreased HCV RNA replication as well as the viral release indicating the importance of BIK expression during HCV infection. In addition, by utilizing the lentivirus system, we showed that transduction of NS5B of genotype 2a (JFH1 strain) into Huh7.5 is sufficient to induce an up-regulation of BIK. Finally, using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we showed the co-localization and interaction of BIK and NS5B in infected cells, respectively, suggesting that BIK may be recruited or interacting with the HCV replication complex via NS5B to assist in the viral replication and release.",

Samples were collected from three time points for analysis (2, 4, and 6 d.p.i.). Four independent experiments were performed and the mean fold change of the mRNA levels as compared to mock was determined. Genes with \u22653 fold changes and p<0.05 at the mRNA level in at least one of the time points were selected for further verification. Upon validation using TaqMan qPCR, 9 genes were identified from the data that showed consistent up- or down-regulation upon HCV infection (Fig. S1). Using TaqMan qPCR method, we obtained a similar trend, although in general, a higher fold change in transcript level for most of the differentially expressed genes, especially at the 6 d.p.i. time point was observed, indicating that the TaqMan qPCR is more sensitive compared to the SYBR green system (Fig. S1) (Cao and Shockey, 2012). Further validation using Western blot analysis indicated that BIK showed consistent up-regulation at the protein level in two of the three time points that were examined and thus was selected as the focus of this study. As shown in\nFig. 1, a significant increase in the mRNA level of Bik was observed as early as 2 d.p.i. (Fig. 1A) while the increase in protein expression was not seen until 4 and 6 d.p.i. (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, both qPCR and Western blot analysis supported the PCR array data where infection with HCV leads to up-regulation of BIK expression. The tissue culture adapted J6/JFH-1-P47 virus has accumulated several mutations to achieve high infectivity in tissue culture system (Bungyoku et al., 2009). To determine whether the up-regulation of BIK is applicable to the parental HCV strain, a similar 6-day infection course was repeated using the J6/JFH-1-P1 virus. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, the level of BIK was also increased at both the mRNA and protein levels albeit to a lesser degree than in the P47-infected cells, with the most significant difference observed during 6 d.p.i. (Fig. S2). As the parental P1 virus is not tissue culture adapted and does not exert a similar level of CPE in host cell as the P47 virus, this result is as expected (Deng et al., 2008). Thus, infection of Huh7.5 cells with HCV induces up-regulation of BIK independent of the mutations from the tissue culture adaptations in the J6/JFH-1-P47 virus.",

The level of knockdown was assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-transfection (d.p.t.). As shown in\nFig. 2A, the endogenous BIK level was successfully depleted and sustained for up to day 8 post-transfection in the siBIK treated cells as compared to the control siRNA group (siCtrl) (Fig. 2A). Upon successful knockdown of BIK, cell viability assay was performed at the indicated time points between siBIK- and siCtrl-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the siBIK-mediated depletion of BIK in Huh7.5 cells did not adversely affect the cell viability across the four measured time points as both the siCtrl- and siBIK-treated cells had similar proliferation rates (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that depletion of endogenous BIK was attainable with 20 nM of siRNA for up to 8 days without affecting the viability or proliferation of the host cells.",

To examine the cells\u2019 response to apoptosis stimulus from HCV infection, siBIK- or siCtrl-treated Huh7.5 cells were infected with HCV J6/JFH-1-P47 and cell viability assay was performed at 0, 2, 4, and 6 d.p.i. Immunoblot analysis revealed successful knockdown of BIK as well as a sustained HCV infection, as indicated by the HCV core protein level (\nFig. 3A). When the caspase-3/7 activity was measured, as an indication for the induction of apoptosis, HCV infected siBIK-treated cells showed a significantly lower caspase-3/7 activity at 4 and 6 d.p.i. as compared to the infected siCtrl-treated cells (Fig. 3B). To substantiate our observed attenuated apoptosis induction in siBIK-treated cells, TUNEL assay was performed to measure the nuclear DNA fragmentation in the infected cells as an indication for apoptosis (Gavrieli et al., 1992). Given that the caspase-3/7 activity assay was only significant on 4 and 6 d.p.i. (Fig. 3B), the TUNEL assay was performed for these two time points. As seen in Supplementary Fig. 3, there were more TUNEL positive cells in the HCV-infected siCtrl-treated cells than the HCV-infected siBIK-tread cells (Fig. S3), which further corroborated the caspase-3/7 (Fig. 3B) results that BIK-depleted Huh7.5 cells were less susceptible to HCV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, when cell viability test was performed, depletion of BIK did not significantly affect the proliferation of Huh7.5 cells infected with HCV, as both HCV-infected siBIK- and siCtrl-treated cells had similar cell viability with proliferation rate progressively inhibited to the same extent by HCV infection when compared to their corresponding mock-infected cells (Fig. 3C). Even though the infected siBIK-treated cells had a reduced level of apoptosis (Fig. 3A, Fig. S3), their viability and proliferation remained unchanged as compared to the siCtrl-treated group.",

Huh7.5 cells were transfected with either siCtrl or siBIK and on 2 d.p.t. HCV infection was performed at MOI of 2 for another 6 days. Data analysis from the qPCR assay showed a significant decrease in the level of HCV RNA replication in the infected siBIK-treated cells as compared to the infected siCtrl-treated cells (\nFig. 4A) on 4 and 6 d.p.i., indicating that BIK is essential for HCV replication in the host cells. A similar inhibitory effect, although not as drastic, was also observed at the protein level as shown in Fig. 3A. Reduction in the HCV core protein level in the siBIK-treated cells was observed especially on 6 d.p.i. (54% of the siCtrl sample) where the decrease in HCV RNA level was most significant (Fig. 4A). When the release of viral particles was examined using IFA, the number of infectious HCV particles released from the siBIK-treated cells was significantly lower on 4 and 6 d.p.i. when compared to the siCtrl-treated group (Fig. 4B). However, the reduction in viral release, although statistically significant, was not as drastic as compared to the decrease in viral RNA replication (Fig. 4A), as only less than 1log decrease was observed in the viral release results. This discrepancy has been observed by others as well where the amount of viral RNA does not always correlate with the number of infectious viral particles released into the supernatant (Park et al., 2013). Nonetheless, our results still support the fact that BIK depletion affects HCV RNA replication and the release of infectious HCV particles into the culture supernatant even though the effect on the latter was not that drastic.",

Preliminary screening from our laboratory suggested that ectopic over-expression of NS5B via transient transfection in Huh7.5 cells led to increase BIK mRNA level (Fig. S4). In order to confirm this observation, lentivirus packaging the HCV NS5B gene was generated and used to transduce Huh7.5 cells. Samples collected at 72 and 96 h post-transduction showed that NS5B-transduced cells contained higher level of BIK at both the transcriptional (\nFig. 5A) and translational stages (Fig. 5B) for both time points as compared to the control vector-transduced sample. Samples from both the control vector- and NS5B-transduced cells were also probed with anti-GFP antibody to confirm the integration and transient expression of the EmGFP gene from the pLenti7.3 vector (Fig. 5B). This result indicated that HCV NS5B protein alone can induce BIK expression in Huh7.5 cells. To determine whether NS5B can induce apoptosis and thus indirectly induce BIK expression, the caspase-3/7 activity was examined in both the control vector- and NS5B-transduced samples at 4 different time points. As shown in supplementary Fig. 5, the caspase-3/7 activity was similar in both sets of samples across all four time points, suggesting that NS5B did not indirectly induce the expression of BIK by activating apoptosis (Fig. S5).",

The fact that NS5B alone is sufficient to up-regulate BIK expression in Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 5) led us to speculate whether NS5B interacts with BIK or both were localized within the same compartment to allow for an interaction. To ascertain this, immunofluorescence analysis were performed so as to determine the localization of BIK and NS5B during HCV infection. Confocal images revealed that both BIK and NS5B co-localized in the ER of HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells (\nFig. 6) confirming our speculation that NS5B maybe recruiting or interacting with BIK at the replication complex in the ER to assist in HCV replication. To confirm a possible interaction between NS5B and BIK, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis was performed using mock and P47-infected Huh7.5 cell lysate with NS5B antibody. As shown in\nFig. 7A, NS5B protein is only present in the P47-infected cell lysate and the level of BIK was increased in the infected sample (Fig. 7A). Using anti-NS5B antibody, BIK was successfully precipitated from the P47-infected cell lysate while absent in the mock lysate (Fig. 7B). To rule out the possibility of BIK unspecifically binding to the protein A beads or the antibody, 1A9, a species matched non-related antibody against SARS spike protein (Ng et al., 2014), was used as a negative control. Our results thus showed positive co-precipitation of BIK with NS5B antibody and not with the control antibody (Fig. 7B). Hence, both the immunofluorescence and Co-IP data confirmed that BIK interacts physically with NS5B and possibly the HCV replication complex.",

            "text": "The molecular characterization of the factors important in HCV infection and HCV-induced apoptosis is not only important in understanding the mechanisms and pathogenesis of the disease but also to provide new targets in the development of novel antiviral therapies. For HCV-induced apoptosis, both host and viral factors have been implicated, however, the molecular mechanisms and the specific factor(s) which perpetuate this process remains largely unknown. The Bcl-2 family members are the major molecular players in programmed cell death (Edlich et al., 2011, Hardwick and Soane, 2013), with some BH3-only proteins reported to play a role in HCV infection (Simonin et al., 2009). The BH3-only pro-apoptotic members, which are the allosteric regulators of the Bcl-2 family members, are known to bind strongly to the pro-survival members through their BH3 domains thereby antagonizing their pro-survival function (Chen et al., 2005). HCV infection has been shown to activate apoptosis through the induction of cell-death related genes and caspase activation (see review (Aweya and Tan, 2011)). Using gene profiling analysis, Walters et al. (2009) revealed that the induction of apoptosis-related genes was linked to the viral load and that this induction of apoptosis was in response to the cell cycle arrest caused by the HCV infection. Among the apoptosis-related genes identified was the Bcl-2 family BH3-only protein, NBK/BIK, the gene of interest in this study that was also identified in our PCR array analysis (Fig. 1). An elevation of BIK expression has been reported in a number of viral infections including HCV infection (Chinnadurai et al., 2008, Subramanian et al., 2007, Walters et al., 2009). However, the functional significance and the molecular mechanisms leading to the up-regulation of BIK expression in HCV infection remain unexplored.",

            "text": "When the effects of BIK depletion on the host cell following HCV infection was examined, no significant difference was observed in the cell viability between the infected BIK-depleted and the control cells, as the proliferation of both infected groups were inhibited to the same extent by HCV relative to the mock (Fig. 3C). A similar observation was made by Urban et al. (2008) where they reported that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in a number of BH3-only proteins, including Bim, Bik, Bmf, BAD, Puma, Noxa or a combination of Bim and BAD (Bim/BAD DKO), died in response to Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection in a similar manner as wild-type MEFs. This thus gives us quite an intriguing contrast because, while the loss of pro-apoptotic BIK protected against HCV-induced apoptosis, there was no significant effect on the cell viability upon HCV infection (Fig. 3B). A couple of reasons could account for this unusual dichotomy. First, it has been demonstrated that there is a diversion of cells to autophagic cell death when there is deficiency or block in apoptosis (Rashmi et al., 2008). Thus, it is probable that the decrease in apoptosis in the HCV-infected BIK-depleted cells is compensated for by an increase in autophagic or other forms of cell death. Recent studies have identified that the Bcl-2 binding partner, Beclin-1 may serve as a link for the crosstalk between the apoptotic and autophagic signaling pathways (see review Gordy and He, 2012). Pattingre et al. (2005) showed that one way of regulating autophagy activation is by sequestering the key inducer of autophagy, Beclin-1, by the Bcl-2 family proteins. A more recent study reported that BCLAF1, a Bcl-2 interacting protein, induces autophagic cell death in myeloma cells by displacing Beclin-1 from Bcl-2 protein (Lamy et al., 2013). Our PCR array screening identified BCLAF1 as one of the genes that were up-regulated during HCV infection and was also validated by TaqMan qPCR (Fig. S1). In the absence of BIK, the increased BCLAF1 expression could in turn activate the autophagic cell death pathway which could possibly explain why the absence of BIK did not have an impact on cell viability (Fig. 3C) despite a significant decrease in apoptosis induction (Fig. 3B, Fig. S3). In addition, the functional redundancy within the BH3-only proteins (Bouillet and Strasser, 2002, Coultas et al., 2004, Happo et al., 2012, Villunger et al., 2003) could also be accountable for the lack of effect of BIK depletion on cell viability in HCV-infected cells.",

            "text": "Viral replication is generally affected by the ability of the virus to counteract pro-apoptotic signals induced by host cells, since premature cell death of infected cells would prevent the production of progeny virions. It is therefore expected that in the absence of pro-apoptotic BIK, viral replication will be enhanced. Interestingly, BIK-knockdown suppresses HCV RNA replication (40% to 50% cf. control) and production of HCV particles (ca. 65% cf. control), suggesting the possible role of BIK in HCV RNA replication (Fig. 4). In order to understand which step in the virus life-cycle that BIK could be involved in, the effects of individual viral proteins on the expression of BIK were determined. Our results show that the expression of NS5B alone is sufficient to increase Bik expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5). So what is the functional significance of BIK up-regulation during HCV infection? The HCV replication complex is in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (El-Hage and Luo, 2003) where BIK is known to be localized (Mathai et al., 2002). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that in HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells both BIK and NS5B are localized in the same compartment within the ER (Fig. 6). Further analysis using Co-IP showed a positive interaction between BIK and NS5B (Fig. 7B). This raises some further interesting questions as to whether NS5B is involved in the recruitment of BIK to the replication complex to assist in HCV replication. Interestingly, several critical interactions between cellular factors and the replication complex of HCV have been reported. For example, HCV NS5A has been shown to specifically interact with the host cell protein TBC1D20 (a Rab1 GTPase-activating protein), depletion of which severely impaired HCV replication and prevented the accumulation of viral RNA (Sklan et al., 2007). Similarly, the interaction of HCV NS4B with Rab5 (also a Rab GTPase) was demonstrated to be crucial for HCV replication (Manna et al., 2010, Stone et al., 2007).",

BIK-depleted Huh7.5 cells are protected against HCV-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, but did not protect the cells against the inhibitory effects of HCV infection on cell viability. More importantly, the data suggest that BIK is essential for HCV RNA replication and viral release as knockdown of BIK significantly affected HCV viral replication and release. BIK is therefore an important host factor that plays a vital role in the host cells\u2019 response to HCV infection and may influence some aspects of the viral life cycle independent of its role in regulating apoptosis during infection. Lastly, both BIK and NS5B are shown to interact as well as co-localized in the same compartment within the ER where the HCV replication complex occurs. It is therefore conceivable to postulate that the interaction between BIK and NS5B in the replication complex is essential for HCV replication. Future work would be done to substantiate this hypothesis.",
