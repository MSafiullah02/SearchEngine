The morning trauma meeting was moved into a large lecture theatre where all members of staff could maintain the 2-m physical distance. The lecture theatre had video conferencing capabilities, allowing staff to participate virtually from another location. As the cases of COVID-19 were detected at the trust it was decided to further restrict attendance in person to just the on-call and theatre teams. The first half of the trauma meeting was run as usual, discussing new admissions and planning the trauma list. The latter half of the meeting was devoted to a daily update on the local cases of COVID-19; the latest local and national advice on practice, and any adjustments to the departmental guidelines. A further virtual meeting for the whole department was introduced at the end of the day to discuss issues, raise concerns and answer questions.",

All clinics were conducted by telephone consultation, and only seeing patients face-to-face when necessary (e.g. plaster change, wound reviews). Where possible patients had their radiographs on an outpatient basis, they were reviewed and patients contacted. Patients attending for change/removal of plaster were either discharged directly or reviewed face-to-face depending on clinical need. To reduce the need for attendance to hospital, patients were placed into a splint/boot in preference to plaster if possible.",

A Senior House Officer (SHO) and registrar were on site from 0800 to 2000, with a Resident Medical Officer (RMO) on overnight with off-site registrar cover. Anecdotally there was a moderate decrease in total trauma referrals, mainly due to less minor trauma presenting to hospital as the public was self-isolating and trying to avoid hospitals. The major trauma, large bone and joint fractures thus far have only seen a very minor decrease. A mini C-arm has been relocated to the fracture clinic in order to offer early manipulation and plaster as the Emergency Department became more focused on respiratory referrals. This remains an evolving duty, and as members of the team become redeployed to the Intensive Care Unit, we are expecting this model to change.",
