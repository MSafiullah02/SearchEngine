Clinicians need to be mindful of the toxicity of a wide variety of possibly unfamiliar substances being tested or repurposed to treat COVID-19. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These two medications may precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias, necessitating cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and in severe cases, treatment with epinephrine and high-doses of diazepam. Recombinant protein therapeutics may cause serum sickness or immune complex deposition. Nucleic acid vaccines may introduce mutations into the human genome. ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.",

We rely on industry or news reports if no other source of information was available. Our discussion here presents our knowledge of novel therapeutics as publicly known in early April 2020. Supervising Editor: Mark B. Mycyk, MD This article will discuss some therapeutic options against SAR-CoV-2, using the life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the mechanism and toxicity of each agent. We will discuss (1) viral cell entry inhibitory (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, APN01), (2) viral replication inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors, nucleotide analogs), (3) nucleic acid vaccines, and (4) miscellaneous medications (azithromycin, ACE inhibitors, and ibuprofen).",

The European Medicines Agency recommended restricting their use pending the outcome of clinical trials [15] . The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT), the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), and the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) recommended in a joint press release that use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should occur only under the direction of a medical provider, for an FDA-approved indication, or as part of a trial for the treatment of COVID-19 or as part of an approved hospital protocol [16] .",

In a retrospective study of 191 patients with chloroquine toxicity, a serum potassium lower than 3.0 mmol/L was correlated with mortality, and the serum potassium decreased as serum chloroquine levels increased [39] . The linear relationship between serum potassium and chloroquine concentrations suggests that hypokalemia reflects an effect of chloroquine itself, although the severely ill patients also received epinephrine infusions (beta-adrenergic agonists can cause intracellular potassium shifts). Total body potassium stores are not expected to be depleted in the setting of chloroquine toxicity, raising concern for rebound hyperkalemia as toxicity resolves. As such, some clinicians recommend less aggressive potassium repletion, supplementing normal daily potassium with 80 mEq per 24 h [39] , though if severe hypokalemia is present, it would be reasonable to replete, while observing for rebound hyperkalemia. The treatment for acute toxicity from hydroxychloroquine is thought to be the same as for acute toxicity from chloroquine.",

            "text": "APN01 (Apeiron Biologics) is a recombinant human ACE2 protein first developed to treat SARS [49] . It may treat COVID-19 by preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry and reducing acute lung injury. It does so by acting as a soluble molecular decoy for SARS-CoV-2, preventing the virus from binding to cellular ACE2 in a dose-dependent fashion [50] . ACE2, in vitro, is the essential receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry [51] and also serves to maintain normal lung physiology. When the virion binds to cell surface ACE2 this lung protective signalingis lost. By preventing ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 interaction, and therefore restoring physiologic ACE2 signaling, APN01 may reduce acute lung injury [52] . A randomized unblinded clinical trial is underway in China to investigate the efficacy of APN01 to reduce viral load and the duration of COVID-19 symptoms [53] .",

Toxicity from recombinant proteins, in general, arises from inadvertent activation of the immune system (unintentional immunogenicity) and binding of the recombinant proteins to other cell surface receptors triggering cellular signal transduction cascades that were not consciously targeted (off-target binding). Unintentional immunogenicity can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies that can deposit in tissues as immune complexes. For example, immune complexes can deposit in the kidney impairing the kidney's ability to filter out toxins and recover electrolytes. If the immune system treats the recombinant protein as an antigen, treatment may precipitate serum sickness. Off-target binding of APN01 could modulate renin-angiotensin signaling, altering blood pressure and organ perfusion. One abstract provides evidence that up to 1.2 mg/kg per day caused no immunogenicity or cardiovascular toxicity in three healthy human volunteers [54] .",

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate is a toxicity of nucleoside analogs that has a high mortality.

If severe toxicity occurs, the offending agent should be stopped.

At this time, however, there is no direct clinical evidence of any impact of ACE inhibitors on the clinical trajectory of those with COVID-19. A retrospective study from Wuhan, China identified hypertension, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease as poor prognostic factors, but did not isolate the relative risk attributable to taking an ACE inhibitor [1] . The worse outcome in this study of patients on ACE inhibitors may reflect the generally poor outcomes of patients with multiple comorbidities. No patient should abruptly discontinue an ACE inhibitor except at the direction of a physician. Blood pressure rapidly rises in the first 48 hours after ACE inhibitor discontinuation [104] , which could precipitate hypertensive emergencies and subsequent acute pulmonary edema.",
