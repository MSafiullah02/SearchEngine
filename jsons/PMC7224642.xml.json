The first cases of respiratory infections of unknown origin emerged in Hubei province (Wuhan, China) in December 2019. The WHO officially announced on February 11, 2020 that the outbreak is caused by the novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus that has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while its associated disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)1. SARS-CoV-2 shares phylogenetic similarities with other coronaviruses, including the one responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2. COVID-19 has quickly turned into a global pandemic, unprecedented in the modern world. As immunosuppressive drugs are prescribed to a greater number of patients, concern exists for increased morbidity and mortality in patients infected with COVID-19 treated with these medications.

Indeed, MMF decreased immune response to influenza vaccine19. Little is known about time to immune recovery from last dose of MMF. Given that MMF suppresses the adaptive immune response, important in fighting viral infections, MMF could potentially increase the risk of viral infections; however, MMF inhibits viral genome replication and gene transcription of Influenza A and B20.

Infections are a well-characterized complication of steroids. A meta-analysis evaluating 71 controlled trials found significantly increased infection rate in patients receiving corticosteroids25. Additionally, although dose less than 20 mg daily are not considered sufficiently immunosuppressive to preclude live vaccinations, treatment discontinuation of 1 to 3 months is recommended prior to live vaccinations for patients on higher daily doses26. Although there is no clear evidence of effects of prednisone on SARS-CoV-2, prednisone has been linked to unfavorable clinical outcomes in other viral infections. For example, prednisone was found to result in significantly higher incidence of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in pH1N1 patients as well as an increased risk of subsequent critical illness or death. Interestingly, patients who were given corticosteroids after the onset of SARI did not have worse outcomes27. Prednisone is known to be beneficial in management of some viral infections: for example prednisone used with acyclovir decreases pain in herpes zoster28. Intriguingly, use of steroids in herpes zoster patients has shown to lead to decreased level of IL-629, an inflammatory cytokine known to be significantly upregulated and a possible therapeutic target in COVID-1930,31. Recent presentations have examined the use of glucocorticoids in COVID-19. Although observational studies failed to provide sufficient evidence for use of steroids in treatment of COVID-19 associated lung injury, there are reports of positive clinical experience with SARS and COVID-1932,33. Based on available data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest that the preemptive discontinuation of prednisone be considered. Patients on prednisone should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infections, we recommend immediate cessation of their prednisone.

Although the duration of AZA effects on the immune system is unclear, hematopoietic recovery was observed after at least 40 days from last dose in CD-1 mice34.

Rituximab can cause B-cell depletion via: 1) Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis; 2) complement-mediated cell lysis; 3) growth arrest, 4) B-cell apoptosis40. Additionally, rituximab may also result indirectly in substantial but reversible depletion of CD4+ T cells41. Rituximab is avoided in patients with chronic hepatitis -B, -C, or HIV. Based on international guidelines, and experience with increasing risks of other types of infections, use of rituximab is being cautioned in the setting of this pandemic, as it may increase the risk of worsening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, according to the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, patients currently receiving treatment with rituximab should take all measures possible to isolate to reduce their risk of infection (msif.org, last accessed March 18, 2020). Currently, given the novelty of COVID-19, there is no study specifically examining the effect of rituximab on the risk of developing infection with COVID-19 in any cohort of patients. In addition, there is no study to our knowledge looking at the risk of acquiring other types of coronavirus that have emerged previously (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, etc). Based on limited data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease rituximab. Given that rituximab can decrease the number of B-cells for over 6 months42, physicians and patients should discuss the possibility of delaying rituximab injections based on individual cases. Patients on rituximab should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infections, we recommend temporary cessation of their rituximab.

Serious side effects of MTX have mostly been reported in the rheumatology literature: bone marrow suppression, liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and increased risk of infections. The lower dermatological dose of MTX (5-15 mg/week) is also thought to carry an increased risk and severity of infection, especially compared to biologics43. Although duration of MTX immunosuppression after its last dose is unclear, RA patients showed improved immunogenicity of influenza vaccination 2-weeks after MTX cessation44. Regarding viral infections, MTX is known to increase incidence of herpes zoster in RA patients45. Additionally, reactivation of hepatitis B upon withdrawal of low-dose MTX in RA patients has also been reported, leading to the screening practice for viral hepatitis prior to initiation of MTX46. Despite evidence of increased infection risk, there is no evidence about the impact of continuing or withholding MTX during an infection on outcomes. Intriguingly, in vivo studies demonstrated MTX inhibits replication of RNA viruses such as Dengue virus and Zika via inhibition of purines and pyrimidines synthesis47,48. There is no data on possible effects of MTX on COVID-19.

Binding of type I IFN to its receptor lead to activation of JAK kinases which then activate the STAT transcription factors to upregulate antiviral immunity49. Selective JAK-inhibitors (JAKi), including ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, are now being used in dermatology. A protective role for IFN-1 against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, has been previously elucidated in vitro\n50 and in vitro\n51. Of particular concern, STAT-1 deficient mice are more susceptible and develop more severe and disseminated infection when exposed to SARS-CoV as compared to wild type mice52,53. A possible role of IFN in the treatment of SARS has been previously suggested54. The potent immunosuppressive effects of tofacitinib were also shown by the almost double rate of herpes zoster among RA patients treated with tofacitinib as compared to those treated with biologics55. Additionally, tofacitinib has been shown to decrease response to pneumococcal vaccination56. Interruption of tofacitinib for 2 weeks improves response to vaccination56. There are no data on effects of JAKi on COVID-19. Based on available data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest discontinuing oral JAKi.

Available evidence of potential worsening of viral diseases with oral JAKi and prednisone exists, although no clear data are available for CVOID-19. We also recommend careful consideration of delaying rituximab infusion on a case to case basis, given that rituximab can lead to prolonged decreased number of circulating B cells. In general, reinstitution of any immunosuppressant should be considered only after a negative COVID-19 test and complete resolution of all COVID-19 related clinical signs and symptoms.
