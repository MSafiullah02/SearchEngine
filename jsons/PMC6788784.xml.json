Paclitaxel is an anti-tubulin drug that causes microtubule stabilization. In the peripheral nervous system, administration of paclitaxel results in distal axonal degeneration, secondary demyelination, and nerve fiber loss.(Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014; Sahenk et al., 1994).",

While most chemotherapy (CTX) drugs do not cross the blood-brain-barrier, they readily penetrate the blood-nerve-barrier and bind to and accumulate in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and peripheral axons.(Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014; Park et al., 2013) In addition to its direct neurotoxic effects, CTX can induce neuroinflammation through activation of immune and immune-like glial cells. In fact, a growing body of preclinical evidence suggests that immune cells (e.g., macrophages, lymphocytes) and glial cells (e.g., Schwann cells) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain.(Krames, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017) This activation of the immune system results in the release of inflammatory mediators, within the DRG and dorsal horn, (Krames, 2014) that enhances neuronal excitability and results in pain hypersensitivity in peripheral neurons (Makker et al., 2017).",

For the second approach (i.e., Expression Profile Analysis (EPA)), we compared our whole transcriptome pattern of DGE between breast cancer survivors with and without CIPN to a database of publicly available and well annotated gene expression experiments to identify other systems and studies with similar patterns. For this analysis, we used demographic, clinical, and gene expression data from our previous study (Kober et al., 2018b).",

As noted in a review on the role of cytokines in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN),(Wang et al., 2012) pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a critical role in the development and maintenance of painful peripheral neuropathy. Consistent with our findings of a differential perturbation in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, several lines of pre-clinical evidence suggest that the administration of paclitaxel is associated with the activation of immune and immune-like cells in both the PNS and CNS. For example, following the administration of intravenous paclitaxel in rats, the number of activated macrophages in the DRG, peripheral nerves, and Schwann cells increased and was associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia.(Peters et al., 2007) Macrophage infiltration results in the production and release of a number of cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL6)) and chemokines. In addition, Schwann cells release TNF-\u03b1, IL6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).(Ozturk et al., 2005) All of these molecules contribute to neuroinflammation.(Sommer and Kress, 2004; Tofaris et al., 2002).",

In the most recent preclinical study,(Sun et al., 2017) expression of IL17 in the spinal cord was evaluated following spinal nerve ligation. During the maintenance phase of neuropathic pain, mRNA expression levels of IL17, IL1\u03b2, and IL6 were significantly increased in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of animals with the nerve injury. The authors concluded that IL17 may contribute to neuropathic pain by promoting the proliferation of astrocytes and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While no studies were found on the role of IL17 in CIPN, astrocytes appear to play a role in the development of this chronic pain condition.(Robinson and Dougherty, 2015; Robinson et al., 2014).",

In addition, leptin expression can be regulated by cytokines.(Carniglia et al., 2017) While no studies were found on associations between leptin and CIPN, in a rat model of chronic constriction injury, administration of a leptin antagonist prevented the development of injury-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia.(Lim et al., 2009) In a mouse model of partial sciatic nerve ligation,(Maeda et al., 2009) leptin production was induced in the adipocytes that were present in the epineurium of the injured nerve and leptin was necessary for tactile allodynia associated with the ligation. In addition, leptin enhanced the production of cyclo\u2011oxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and matrix metalloprotease-9 from macrophages that suggests that adipokines activate macrophages that contribute to the development of neuropathic pain. However, in another preclinical study, leptin exhibited protective effects in a model of sciatic nerve injury.(Fernandez-Martos et al., 2012).",

Of particular interest is the growing body of evidence that suggests that one member of this pathway (i.e., NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)) is involved in various types of neuropathic pain.(Khan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2018; Pu et al., 2018; Tonkin et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019) Of note, in a recent preclinical study of PIPN in rats,(Jia et al., 2017) paclitaxel increased the expression of and activated fragments of caspase-1 and IL1\u03b2 which suggests activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expression of NLRP3 was located in CD68 macrophages that infiltrated the L4\u20135 DRG and sciatic nerve. The authors concluded that their findings suggest that the administration of paclitaxel induced mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species production that resulted in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in peripheral nerves and contributes to PIPN (Jia et al., 2017).",

It is important to note that while our survivors' DGE profile was derived using blood samples, the preclinical findings came from a different species (i.e., rodents) and different tissues (i.e., spinal cord, DRG). Gene expression differences across tissues are mainly driven by a small number of genes,(Mele et al., 2015) suggesting that gene expression changes in one tissue may provide insights into gene expression patterns in another tissue. Changes in gene expression in whole blood have been used as a marker for neuronal injury.(Tang et al., 2003) In addition, gene expression patterns in blood, hippocampus, and pre-frontal cortex show broad levels of co-expression.(Witt et al., 2013) Given the recent interest in evaluating for concordance and discordance in the expression of genes that represent known biomarkers and therapies across tissues(Kosti et al., 2016), the controversy about whether changes in GE in peripheral blood reflects changes within the PNS and CNS (Colleoni and Sacerdote, 2010; Seok et al., 2013; Jaggi et al., 2011), and our findings of similarities between human whole blood and pre-clinical models of neuropathic pain in neuronal tissue (i.e., rat DRG (GDS2439) and mouse SC (GDS2159)), future research should evaluate for genes that are similar and unique to these tissue types in relation to PIPN. Another point worth noting is that in some of the preclinical studies that were identified using EPA, differences in GE were evaluated days to months after the nerve injury. This evaluation time frame is consistent with a more chronic pain phenotype and perhaps is more relevant to our cohort of survivors who had PIPN for 3.8 (\u00b13.9) years. The EPA analysis did not evaluate for any specific preclinical or human studies of CIPN or PIPN.",

While our sample size was relatively small, we had an extremely well characterized sample of breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN. Of note, no differences were found in the total cumulative dose of paclitaxel that these survivors received. Although not significantly different between groups in this study, exercise regularity may contribute to differences in differential gene expression between breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN. Given that an evaluation of differences in gene expression from DRG neurons cannot be done in living individuals, like others,(Langjahr et al., 2018; Uceyler et al., 2007) we evaluated for differences in RNA expression using peripheral blood. Some limitations of using whole blood to evaluate for patterns of expression in other tissues include: blood shows the largest number of uniquely expressed genes (Mele et al., 2015); blood has the smallest number of expressed transcripts across tissues;(Consortium, 2015) and baseline blood does not share similar whole-transcriptome pattern with DRG, as well as other CNS or PNS tissue.(Ray et al., 2018).",

Despite the limitations of the analyses of RNA from blood, we did observe profiles of DGE and perturbations in these processes, which suggest persistent damage and/or changes in the PNS. Given that these survivors had PIPN for approximately four years, our findings suggest that chronic neuroinflammation is involved in the maintenance of this neuropathic pain condition. Future studies need to evaluate for differences in epigenetic changes (i.e., methylation, microRNA) between survivors with and without PIPN, which may reflect changes in regulation patterns.",
