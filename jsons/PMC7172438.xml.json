Foreign bodies could be small toys, coins or foods like fish bones and meat bolus with or without bones (e.g. lamb meat). Pharygo-oesophageal FBs with sharp edges (e.g. a piece of chicken bone) or button batteries need to be prioritized due to risk of perforation if not treated appropriately. The vast majority of swallowed FBs pass through the digestive tract and are egested often undetected. The main complications of foreign bodies are aspiration, migration of foreign body, oesophageal perforation and abscess. Plain radiographs with lateral view can help in the diagnosis and localization of the foreign body. The FBs are removed under general anaesthesia in case of children. In the case of adults, FBs can be removed with different techniques ranging from flexible or rigid angled nasoendoscopy and curved forceps under local anaesthesia to flexible oesophagoscopy and rigid endoscopy under general anaesthesia.15\n",

The manoeuvre involves compression of upper abdomen to exert pressure on the diaphragm and subsequently on the lungs to expel the FB. In infants, it involves lying the child on an adult's knee and pressing firmly on the upper abdomen. Peak incidence of inhaled FB is between 1 and 3 years of age and there is typically a history of choking episode. If the child is well enough then a chest x-ray will help with diagnosis and localization of FB. The main complications of untreated tracheobronchial tree FBs are pneumonia and pneumothorax. In the acute emergency with a compromised airway, high flow oxygen and Heliox (i.e. helium and oxygen) buys time for definitive treatment. Removal is achieved by the ENT surgeon aided by senior paediatric anaesthetist using a bronchoscope and optical forceps under general anaesthesia. Once the FB is removed, meticulous examination of the tracheobronchial tree must be undertaken to exclude fragments or further FBs or any anatomical variations. The child should be closely monitored for 24 hours. Children with a history of inhaled foreign body and persistent respiratory symptoms should be assumed to have a foreign body in the lung and managed appropriately.",
