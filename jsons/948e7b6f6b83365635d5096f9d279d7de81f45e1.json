Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases. Using the bioinformatics and structural modeling approach, we modeled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminal regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modeling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated proton channel. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds. Additionally, two distinct \"core\" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral proton channeling activity which may play a critical role in viral infection. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for LAV development and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.",

The emergence of human coronaviruses in the 21st century with enhanced pathogenicity was seen in the case of SARS-CoV-1 mediated infection in 2002, reporting almost 8000 detected cases worldwide and a mortality rate of 10 %. This was followed by MERS-CoV mediated near-pandemic in 2012 infecting almost 2500 people worldwide with a mortality rate of 36% (5) . The ongoing novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the other hand, has a lower fatality rate in comparison with the previous coronavirus outbreaks, but a higher human-to-human contagion efficiency than the previous ones (6) . This has led to the spread of this infection worldwide, across continents, affecting millions.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have four main structural proteins-(i) Nucleocapsid protein (N), (ii) Spike protein (S), (iii) Membrane protein (M), and (iv) Envelope protein (E). The E protein is the smallest of all the structural proteins of 8-12 kDa and is involved in a wide spectrum of functional repertoire (7) . It comprises of three domains: (i) short hydrophilic N-terminus domain consisting of 7-12 amino acids, (ii) hydrophobic transmembrane domain which is around 25 amino acids long, and (iii) long hydrophilic C terminal (8) (9) (10) . The hydrophobic transmembrane domain oligomerizes to form pentameric ion channels in the ERGIC (ER-Golgi Intermediate compartment) membrane having low or no ion selectivity (11) (12) (13) . A \u03b2-coil-\u03b2 motif present in the C terminal of E protein contains a conserved proline residue (14) which is indispensable for its localization in the ER-Golgi complex (15) . Previous studies show that the last 4-5 residues of SARS-CoV E protein form a PDZ-binding motif, deletion of which resulted in revertant mutants and reversal of its pathogenicity (16, 17) . This, interestingly, points to a potential target for the development of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs): generating certain mutations in the E protein while keeping the PDZ-binding motif intact (7) . During the viral replication cycle, the virus incorporates a small proportion of the viral E protein expressed within the infected host, into the virion particles (18) . The larger proportion of E protein is localized at the sites of mammalian intracellular trafficking, the ER-Golgi network and the ERGIC (19) . This localization in the intracellular trafficking components of the host cell helps in the assembly of viral structure and budding (19) . Coronaviruses lacking the E protein produced virion particles with crippled maturation and were incompetent in forming new virion particles (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . The role of the E protein as a non-specific ion channel on the ER-Golgi membrane of the host cell has also been suggested (12, 13, 19) . Recent studies have shed light on a large number of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and identified two classes of small molecules -mRNA translation inhibitors and Sigma factor 1 and 2 receptor regulators, which showed antiviral activity (5) against novel SARS-CoV-2.",

The development of therapeutic approaches is being hindered due to the lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms and molecular players responsible for this novel viral infection (5) . The possibility of E protein being a vaccine candidate has already been explored with the MERS-CoV; certain mutations towards the C-terminal end combined with mutations in the NS1 protein resulted in a stable vaccine against the virus, overcoming the pathogenesis of the revertant mutants (16) . Since CoV E-protein forms pentameric non-selective ion channels in the membrane (11) (12) (13) , we modeled the SARS-CoV-2 E protein using the SARS-CoV-1 NMR structure (10) as the template. M2 viroporin of Influenza A virus has been reported to function as a proton channel with a water-hopping mechanism in a conformational dependent manner (25) . Similarly, we identified key amino acid residues lining the inner luminal side of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, and subsequent water docking models suggest that the pentameric structure is able to form dynamic closed and open states. While it calls for detailed studies, the E-protein presents a potential target for the development of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) and other therapeutic strategies to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.",

E protein of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in April (Accession number: QII57162.1) was used as the search reference. Some E-proteins specific to bat (HKU3-7), human SARS 2018, bat SARS_RsSHC014, bat BtRI-BetaCoV, human SARS-CoV-1 and human SARS-CoV-2 (Accession number: QII57162.1) show a high degree of conservation in their amino acid composition ( Fig. 1b ) . In comparison, we also looked at the conservation of amino acids for the spike proteins ( Suppl. Fig. 1a ), M-proteins ( Suppl. Fig. 1b ) and protein 7a ( Suppl. Fig. 1c ). The candidate E-proteins from different origins were closely associated when we plotted the evolutionary distance ( Suppl. Fig. 1d ). All the selected sequences of Spike proteins, M proteins, E-proteins, and protein 7a were selected based on a 90-100% sequence identity . The amino acid composition indicated that the E-proteins have a larger proportion of Leucine (LEU) and Valine (VAL) compared to either the Spike or the M-proteins ( Fig. 1c i-iii ). Of particular interest was the increased disparity index among spike proteins compared to the E-proteins ( Fig. 1d i-ii) . The value of the disparity index close to 1 (red) indicated larger differences in amino acid composition bias than expected only out of chance probability and evolutionary divergence (26) . Using the amino acid composition, we calculated the probability of accumulating mutation for a particular residue as a proxy of mutability. We found that leucine (LEU, 0.189 \u00b1 0.132), valine (VAL, 0.25 \u00b1 0.13) and serine (SER, 0.461 \u00b1 0.091) ( Fig. 1e ; indicated by $$) of the E proteins have lower than 50% chance of mutability compared to spike proteins (LEU (0.626 \u00b1 0.004), VAL (0.652 \u00b1 0.004) and SER (0.632 \u00b1 0.006)) ( Fig. 1e ). Given the role of E proteins in viral infection (19) , we think that E-proteins present to us a relatively stable viral protein that demands greater investigation to elucidate its mechanistic insights and features.",

Based on homology modeling, we obtained 16 different structural models from both the GalaxyWEB ( Suppl. Fig.  2a -p ) and SWISS-MODEL ( Suppl. Fig. 3a-p ) . The model obtained from GalaxyWEB spanned the entire protein (1-75) but the five residues (PDLLV) in the C-terminal end of the protein were removed which reduces the structural flexibility of that region improving the MolProbity parameters. The model obtained from SWISS-MODEL spanned from 8-65 residues similar to the NMR structure. All the models from both these protocols and the template structures were validated using MolProbity. The GalaxyWEB models were chosen based on the following observations: (i) they spanned a longer region of the protein (Fig.  2g -i, ii) and (ii) they had better validation scores (Clash score and MolProbity score). The final structural model ( Fig. 2 b-i) was chosen depending on the structural validation parameters obtained from MolProbity ( Fig. 2h-green ) .

The distances of the terminal guanidino group of the side chain of ARG 38 with the phosphoryl group of the charged headgroup of ceramide ( 2.32 \u212b; Fig. 5c ) and the carbonyl group of the charged headgroup of phosphatidylcholine ( 2.29 \u212b, Fig. 5f ) were calculated.

The pore volumes of all the putative states of E-put respectively ( Fig. 6c ) showed an increase in pore volume during the transition from the closed discontinuous state ( Fig. 6c-i ) to continuous channel states 1 and 2 ( Fig. 6c-ii-iii ) . The volume finally decreases when the conformation returns back to the closed discontinuous state ( Fig. 6c-iv) . The water docking phenomena performed in SWISS-DOCK with all the three putative conformational states further validates this hypothesis ( Suppl. Fig. 6a-i-iii ) . As a molecular mechanism of how these physical states might be achieved, the orientations of the bottleneck residue PHE 26 in all the three states were analyzed: (1) Closed discontinuous state ( Fig. 6e-i, side view, Suppl.  Fig. 6b-i-iii ) (2) Continuous channel state 1 ( Fig. 6e-ii, side view, Suppl. Fig. 6c-i-iii) (3) Continuous channel state 2 ( Fig. 6e-iii, side view, Suppl. Fig. 6d-i-iii ) . We observe a particular recurring change in the PHE 26 orientation during the putative conformational changes from discontinuous closed to the continuous open state and back to the closed discontinuous state ( Fig. 6e-iv, side view, Suppl. Fig.  6b-iii) . On the other hand, the orientation of the PHE 4 residue across the three conformations acts as a gate regulating the putative closed and open states of E-put ( Suppl. Fig. 6e ). The conformational changes during its transition from the putative closed to open states in the E-put protein could be a biophysical mechanism of regulation of the pore, resembling that of influenza A M2 viroporin (25) .",

We have identified various component residues of the pentameric E protein lining its luminal surface which might take part in various molecular events during its conformational changes and corresponding functionalities. The ARG 38 seems to act as the hook of the protein anchoring it to the mammalian ER-Golgi membrane. The orientation of the residues of the hydrophobic funnel (LEU 37, ALA 36, ILE 33) enables water molecules to travel inside the funnel without any critical steric clashes. This is evident from the large distances of their side chains from the docked water molecule, which is beyond the H-bonding limit and short-range interactions limit as well.",

The bottleneck is followed by a hydrophobic pocket which we call the central core, lined by ALA 22 and LEU 18. ASN 15 and GLU 8 are the polar/charged residues present below the central pore which are at H-bond forming distance from water molecules inside the luminal surface of the pore. The N-terminal end of the E-put protein has a gate-like region mediated by PHE 4. The proposed intermediate structures of the E-put which were two of the 16 GalaxyWEB outputs, had MolProbity and Clash score in the following order: Closed discontinuous state < Continuous Channel state 1 > Continuous Channel state 2 > Closed discontinuous state. The Continuous Channel state 1 and 2 have less stability and possibly higher energy states than the closed discontinuous state. This change of conformation of E-put protein is mediated by the PHE 26 at the bottleneck region which changes its orientation during the transition to the intermediates and PHE 4 which attains closed and open conformations during respective intermediates. The change in pore volume among the conformations also aligns with our hypothesis of intermediate states regulating the E-put protein. All these in silico findings show that the E-put protein may act as a proton channel. The movement of the protons is mediated by the formation of continuous chains of water clusters via a water-hopping mechanism partly similar to the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus as reported by Acharya et al., 2010 (25) .",

It is to be noted that the protein is highly hydrophobic and has a transmembrane domain which increases the difficulty of protein purification and crystallographic studies. However, they can be easily targeted for site-directed mutagenesis or deletion of a functional domain. LAV is a vaccine strategy that takes advantage of the existing virulence of the virus but consists of one or more mutations or deletion of specific regions of the protein resulting in the loss of its pathogenic activity. As a result, the host is able to generate immunological memory to eliminate existing viruses and provide future protection. A possible strategy could be the deletion of the transmembrane domain of the E-put protein, keeping the ER-Golgi targeting sequence in the C-terminal intact, which might lead to attenuation of the virus. Secondly, site-directed mutagenesis of the residues like ASN 15 and GLU 8 could also eliminate its channeling activity. In addition, mutation of PHE 4 and PHE 26 can render rigidity to the structure affecting its ability to change its conformation during its functionality.",

The radius of the bottleneck region of the E-put protein was calculated with the centroid of the triangle formed by the different orientations of PHE 26 in closed or open conformation. The distance from the vertices of the triangle thus formed from the centroid was then used to calculate the effective radius. All the medians meet at a point inside the triangle, called the centroid. The distances of the three vertices from the centroid are equal to two-thirds of the length of the median passing through the respective vertices. The distances of each of the vertices from the centroid are considered as the pore radii of the protein in three different directions. The average value of all these radii is calculated as the effective pore radius of the protein.",
