Depending on the type of aircraft, about half of the cabin air is recirculated. The other half is fresh air that is supplied by engine compressors, cooled by air-conditioning packs, and then blended with recirculated air. As a reference point, an office building may recirculate between 65 and 95% of its air. Older aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and McDonald-Douglas DC-9 do not recirculate air. It is only with the fuel crisis in the 1970s that modifications were made to newer aircraft to decrease the amount of fresh air brought into the cabin by the engines, thereby decreasing fuel consumption.

Interestingly, aircraft cabin microbial aerosols were reported lower during night flights when presumably there was less passenger activity and were higher during daytime flights when passengers were more likely to get out of their seats to walk up and down the airplane aisle.",

The cabin milieu is much like that of a desert environment (12-21% humidity). Relative humidity can be between 5 and 35% on most aircraft. The low humidity is caused by the frequent renewal of cabin air with outside air. With outside air temperatures being well below 0\u00b0 F (\u221218\u00b0 C), little appreciable moisture or heat is brought into the cabin. Air bled off the engines must be circulated and warmed to bring it to a comfortable range. Exposure to this environment for prolonged periods is known to cause dehydration due to insensible water loss as well as to exacerbate respiratory conditions. It is of interest to note, however, that the low humidity can actually inhibit bacterial and fungal growth.",

It is important to document the level of infectiousness of the source passenger. In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, factors such as anatomic involvement, positive acid-fast bacilli smears, history of transmission, and prior treatment of the source case must be considered. Further, the proximity to the source case and duration of exposure all figure into the post-exposure notification algorithm. Literature clearly reflects that proximity to the source case is one of the most important variables in the transmission of infectious disease. Thus, a passenger traveling in first class need not necessarily be notified of a source case seated in the rear of the aircraft in the coach section. Similarly, those whose exposure was limited to less than 8 hours are very unlikely to need notification.",

However, US public health agencies led by the CDC have taken a more active role and now may require airlines to release electronic passenger data by issuing a Directive Order in the event of a confirmed possible exposure in-flight. In addition, there is now a requirement for the commander of an aircraft destined for a US airport to report immediately to the nearest CDC Quarantine Station any death or illness among passengers or crew, prior to arrival.

Although it is not easily transmitted to humans, more than 500 human cases have been reported since 2003 in parts of Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, with a case mortality rate of about 60%. Transmission of avian flu H5N1to humans usually involves direct contact with infected birds, but if the virus mutates and becomes more easily spread from human to human (e.g., airborne by the respiratory route), this could start an influenza pandemic or worldwide outbreak of disease. Avian influenza H7N9 virus continues to cause severe outbreaks of disease on poultry farms in China, in other Asian countries, and in the US. So far, human cases reported from Asia have not led to sustained human-to-human transmission. Considering the possibility of an avian flu pandemic in the future, IATA in cooperation with the CDC developed guidelines for airline personnel meeting passengers arriving from known outbreak areas, as well as for airline cleaning and maintenance crews who may potentially be exposed. All guidelines emphasize basic hygiene practices to prevent becoming ill, such as hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, separation of any ill passengers and providing them with a surgical mask or tissues to cover the mouth and nose, use of disposable gloves when handling blood or body fluids, and prompt reporting of the illness to public health authorities. Specialized personal protective equipment such as respirators or gowns is not recommended except in direct patient-care situations, although the use of surgical masks when around symptomatic individuals in public areas may be considered. Specialized passenger screening techniques such as thermal screening to identify febrile passengers when pre-boarding that were utilized during the SARS epidemic in some international locations are not being recommended at this time.",

Cases of DVT have been reported following long train and automobile trips.

As per figures published by the American Heart Association, sudden cardiac death occurs in about 1000 people per day in the United States. The chance of survival in such an event is less than 1 in 10. As in the teaching for all basic and advanced rescue personnel, the adage \u201cshock first and shock fast\u201d is of paramount importance. With ventricular fibrillation being the most common and the most treatable rhythm disturbance found at time of cardiac death, the importance of AEDs cannot be understated.Image 5\n",

All flight crew members including pilots receive training in the location, function, and intended use of AEDs, and flight attendants receive initial and recurring training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of AEDs every 2 years. This far-reaching regulation has gone a long way in making air travel safer for the thousands of passengers who fly with medical conditions both known and undiagnosed.",

The behavior of the flying public reflects on the informality, self-indulgence, and permissiveness of modern society. Passengers engaging in personal grooming and hygiene tasks, including changing baby diapers in the close quarters of the economy class seat row, demonstrate gross bad manners. Crying babies and unruly children may cause nearby passengers to feel irritated and miserable. Alcohol intoxication, side effects of recreational and even prescribed drugs, sleep deprivation, jet lag, and/or mental stress may create acute psychological problems in certain passengers during air travel that could possibly result in injury to others who try to intercede. While airlines continue to work on ways to prevent, manage, and control passengers behaving badly, individual travelers who are affected should exit their seats if possible and quietly ask for assistance from a flight attendant, rather than directly confronting the person or persons creating the disturbance. Chapter 16, \u201cTravel with Chronic Medical Conditions,\u201d and Chapter 17, \u201cMental Health and Travel,\u201d also contain advice on neuropsychiatric conditions and travel.",
