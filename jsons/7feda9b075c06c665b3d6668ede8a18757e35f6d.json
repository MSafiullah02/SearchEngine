In the early 1990s an arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV), was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease. Since then research has progressed substantially. Most recently \"porcine high fever disease\" was reported in China starting in 2006 with PRRSV being a critical virus associated with high morbidity and mortality (20%) associated with this syndrome which in 2010 is still causing severe pathology in pigs in China, with spread to Vietnam and Cambodia. This volume contains a series of reviews that highlight the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology, vaccinology and host genetic control. This paper provides a brief historical review of PRRS and the associated PRRSV. It presents areas of research gaps that inhibit current progress towards PRRS elimination through production of effective vaccines and current plans for PRRS elimination or eradication programs. It is hoped that this discussion will stimulate further collaboration between researchers and swine veterinarians throughout the world to provide answers that enhance our understanding of PRRS and PRRSV in an effort to eliminate this economically important disease.",

A similar clinical syndrome was initially described in Germany in 1990 and spread to other countries in Europe over the next few years. Despite several reports describing a number of different agents as the cause of this disease, the causative agent remained unknown leading to the name \"mystery swine disease\" in the U.S. and either \"porcine epidemic abortion and respiratory syndrome\" or \"blue-ear pig disease\" in Europe. The latter name refers to the cyanosis or blue-reddish coloration of ears of pigs with this disease. Once the etiology of this \"mystery\" disease was established the name swine infertility and respiratory syndrome (SIRS) was suggested by North American investigators while the Europeans preferred porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). The latter name is now the accepted name for the syndrome.",

The 15 kb genome consists of two large open reading frames ORF 1a and 1b that comprise 75% of the viral genome and are translated and processed into 14 non-structural proteins (nsp) that exhibit replicase, protease and polymerase activities required for viral replication (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . As described in several articles in this issue, reverse genetics and infectious virus clones have become the predominate tools for understanding nsp function (Faaberg et al., this issue; Fang and Snijder, this issue; Sun et al., this issue; Yoo et al., this issue) . In this issue, Fang and Snijder (this issue) explore the functional characterization of the key nsp encoded enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis, the nsp9 RNA polymerase and nsp10 helicase, the induction of replication-associated membrane rearrangements (nsp2 and nsp3), and a replicative endoribonuclease (nsp11). Yoo et al. (this issue) note that at least four viral proteins have been studied as viral antagonists of host defenses: N as a structural protein and three non-structural proteins, nsp1 (nsp1\u2423 and nsp1\u2424), nsp2, and nsp11. Fang and Snijder (this issue) identified the nsp3-8 region as possibly containing PRRS virulence factors. An important element in virus replication, the 5 and 3 untranslated regions are explored by Sun et al. (this issue) using infectious clones. This set of reviews affirms how the technical advancements offered by reverse genetics are already leading to important developments for the understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis and for the design of novel vaccine approaches.",

They include three N-glycosylated minor envelope proteins (GP2a, GP3 and GP4), ORF 2b that encodes a non-glycosylated minor protein 2b (Wu et al., 2001) and the major envelope glycoprotein GP5 that forms a heterodimer with the membrane non-glycosylated protein M (Mardassi et al., 1996; Snijder et al., 2003) . The heterodimer consisting of the GP5 and M proteins is required for infectivity of arteriviruses (Snijder et al., 2003) ; 2b is also essential for virus infectivity and likely functions as an ion channel to facilitate uncoating of the virus . The three main structural proteins N, M and GP5 are required for particle formation and viral infectivity, whereas the minor proteins (GP2a, GP3 and GP4) are essential only for viral infectivity (Wissink et al., 2005) . One additional structural protein N, or nucleocapsid protein, is encoded by ORF7 and is highly immunogenic and has served as the main diagnostic protein to detect antibodies to PRRSV (Dea et al., 2000) . The N protein is found in both the cytoplasm (viral particle assembly) and the nucleus where it has an important role in antagonizing cellular gene function. Dokland (this issue) explored the structural biology of PRRSV and affirmed that based on detailed structural analyses this arterivirus is more closely related to coronaviruses than previously thought.",

            "text": "The virus can persist in pigs for long periods of time. The first reported evidence of persistence was transmission of PRRSV from an infected sow to susceptible pigs 99 days post-infection (Zimmerman et al., 1992) . Others have detected (either by virus isolation or swine bioassay) virus in tonsil and lymph nodes up to 132 days after birth in pigs infected in utero (Benfield et al., 2000; Rowland et al., 2003; Rowland, this issue) ; and from 105 to 157 days post-infection in young pigs (Allende et al., 2000; Horter et al., 2002; Wills et al., 1997b) . High levels of viral RNA are present in lymphoid tissues in acutely infected pigs and over time viral loads decrease by 1000-fold or more in tonsil and lymph nodes the primary sites of viral persistence (Xiao et al., 2004) . The mechanism of persistence is not completely understood but likely includes the emergence of viral variants which can escape host defenses (Rowland et al., 1999) . Studies using mutations in viral genes or the use of chimeras have established potential roles for certain nsp and structural genes in viral virulence and attenuation. Strains with mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the N protein produce lower levels of viremia, a shorter duration of viremia in pigs, higher levels of neutralizing antibodies and reduced viral persistence in tonsils of pigs compared to pigs given the wild-type virus Pei et al., 2008) . Experiments using reverse genetics indicate that virulence is probably multigenic involving nsp3-8 proteins and GP5 Wang et al., 2008) . These latter studies indicated that certain PRRSV chimeras produce attenuated clinical signs in either a respiratory (Wang et al., 2008) or pregnant sow model . Finally, the highly virulent strain of PRRSV responsible for the outbreak in China in 2006 contains a unique 30-amino acid deletion in the nsp2 coding region that was presumed to be responsible for the increased virulence of these PRRSV strains. However, a recent study by Zhou et al. (2009) indicates that the nsp2 deletion is not associated with virulence of the high fever disease isolates. As reported in this issue, deletions in nsp2 can attenuate replication and virulence (Faaberg et al., this issue) .",

PRRSV strains are now divided into two genotypes, European genotype (Type 1) and North-American (Type 2), both genotypes circulate globally (Kimman et al., 2009; Zimmerman et al., 2006) . Strains within each genotype also vary considerably with sequence differences as high as 20% (Han et al., 2007; Meng, 2000; Nielson et al., 1999) . The most variable structural protein is GP5 with 50-55% amino acid homology between North American and European isolates (Mardassi et al., 1996; Meng et al., 1995; Nielson et al., 1999) . In this issue Shi et al.

Shortly after infection, most antibodies are non-neutralizing and are principally targeted to N and nsp2 proteins. Neutralizing antibodies appear as early as 2-4 weeks after infection but usually do not peak until several weeks to months later (Lopez and Osorio, 2004) . The role of neutralizing antibodies has been debated principally because viremia persists in the host in the presence of neutralizing activity. The postulated role of antibody evasion strategies, such as immunodominant \"decoy\" epitopes that produce non-protective immune responses and \"glycan shielding\" have been recently reviewed and discussed (Kimman et al., 2009) .

The key question is how to deal with the heterogeneity of PRRSV field isolates and provide cross-protection among heterologous strains of virus. The concept of \"heterologous\" in terms of PRRSV vaccines remains undefined.

Thus, the potential for aerosol spread through respiratory and oropharyngeal excretions within swine confinement units is a distinct possibility. In this issue, Kittawornrat et al.

Early laboratory experiments to prove aerosol transmission were disappointing and the conclusion was that aerosol transmission was not common and difficult to achieve over short distances of 1.0-2.5 m (Lager and Mengeling, 2000; Otake et al., 2002; Wills et al., 1997a) . In contrast, observations in the field were that extensive efforts to eliminate and eradicate PRRSV from swine herds, while initially successful, always seemed to result in re-infection of these herds and the only explanation appeared to be area spread through aerosols. In this issue, Dee et al. (this issue) describe the use of air filtration systems in the field as an effective means to reduce transmission.",

Through the efforts of many scientists throughout the world a better understanding of the virology, pathogenesis, immunology, genetic resistance, epidemiology and vaccinology has been gained. Within three years after the discovery of the PRRSV, a modified-live vaccine became available and was quickly used throughout swine producing areas in the world. The question of what drives the evolution of this virus in the field and how to provide cross-protection versus heterologous field strains remains an important and unresolved question.",

            "text": "Despite our lack of understanding of the innate and acquired immune response to PRRSV, it should be remembered that the host eventually eliminates the virus. Experimental evidence indicates that PRRSV is eventually eliminated from the host and persistent infection rarely last more than 200 days (Murtaugh, 2009) . Veterinarians have used this information to develop the concept of \"herd closure\" as a means to eliminate PRRSV from herds. In herd closure all animals are exposed to PRRSV by vaccination or inoculation with virulent virus and then the herd is closed to all animal entry for 200 days. When na\u00efve gilts are introduced into these herds they remain negative. If there are re-breaks, it is almost always with a virus of a different genotype thus indicating a new outbreak (Murtaugh, 2009 ). This protocol is being used in \"regional elimination programs\" throughout the U.S. in an effort to eliminate PRRSV from less dense swine areas. The combination of vaccines, herd closure, biosecurity protocols and filtration units on swine housing to prevent area spread may well become the protocol for elimination of this virus in regional areas, as reviewed in this issue by Morrison et al. (this issue) .",
