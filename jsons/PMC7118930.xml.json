Poor IAQ may cause various health problems leading to morbidity, disability, disease, or even death [4], [5]. In addition to indoor contaminant sources, incursion of outdoor pollutants through ventilation or infiltration is another significant factor in IAQ [5], especially for natural ventilation through open windows in residential buildings [6]. Meanwhile, many new environmental problems has emerged in densely populated areas because of the increasing presence of high-rise residential (HRR) buildings, even though the housing problem is solved to some extent [7]. A good understanding of the mechanism and characteristics of airborne pollutant transmission and dispersion in and around the building is thus the perquisite for architects and building managers to employ effective indoor air pollution control strategies [8], particularly during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases.",

            "text": "A special airborne transmission route called inter-flat (or inter-unit) transmission, namely air cross-contamination between flats within the same building, was identified during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and started to be investigated in 2003. Using epidemiologic analysis, experimental studies and airflow simulations, Yu et al. [20] first revealed the high probability of an airborne spread of the SARS virus in one residential block. Then, Li et al. provided further analyses in an HRR building [21] and a hospital [22], where the largest outbreak happened, to show the dispersion through interior doors and window leakage. On the other hand, smaller-scale SARS clusters occurred in several other HRR buildings, such as in Wing Shui House and Hing Tung House [23], where the most affected households were located along the same vertical blocks on different floors. Similar case can also be observed in Germany [24], and it is common for residents to detect the cooking odors from neighbors. Based on these facts, Niu et al. [25] first proposed the possible transmission of inter-flat air cross-contamination under the condition of single-sided natural ventilation through openings. Such single-sided case usually exists in densely occupied residential buildings where there may be only one open window for one small cellular room. This inter-flat transmission and dispersion, driven by wind turbulence and/or temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air, may be a valid route due to the short dispersion distances between flats and the large openings involving considerable airflow exchanges.",

Later, a series of wind tunnel tests [31], [32], [33], [34] and numerical simulations [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40] was carefully performed to study the inter-flat airborne transmission and dispersion dominated by wind effect.

In such case, a pressure difference between indoor and outdoor air occurs, as shown in Fig. 1(a). As a result, the buoyancy (or stack) effect is created, where the higher interior pressure at the upper part drives outflows while the lower interior pressure at the lower part drives inflows. When the indoor and outdoor air temperatures equalize, the pressure difference is nearly zero and thus no driving force is produced for ventilation.

Based on the analysis of the meteorological information from the nearby stations of the building with SARS clusters, low wind speeds (<3 m/s) can be observed, especially during evening and dawn time (around 0.1 m/s) [26]. Such windless case indicates that the buoyant plume is the dominant driving force for building ventilation. Besides, local residents are likely to open windows for night-time cooling instead of using air conditioners during that season. In view of these facts, Niu et al. [25] first proposed the hypothesis that on windless days, the warm airflow escaping from the upper part of the window in the lower floor may mix with outdoor fresh airflow and partially re-enter the lower part of the window in the upper floor, as shown in Fig. 2\n. A further hypothesis was also proposed by Niu et al. [25] that for multi-storey HRR buildings, there exists a \u201ccascade\u201d inter-flat flow starting from the lower floor and ending at the top floor when buoyancy effects dominate (Fig. 2).",

In particular, pure buoyancy-driven single-sided natural ventilation through a lower and upper opening in a three-storey building was simulated by Allocca et al.

An indoor contaminant source at a lower flat can be a considerable contributor to concentrations in the vertical adjacent upper flat under certain meteorological conditions. In general, both on-site measurements [26] and numerical simulations [29] have revealed that, when buoyancy effects dominate, the re-entry ratio of exhaust air from a lower flat to the adjacent upper flat can reach up to about 7%.

[28]. In spite of different assumed conditions and definitions of the resulting mass fractions, both experimental and simulation studies have found that the concentration level is generally lower by about two orders of magnitude in the upper room than in the lower room. Similar results can also be observed from Gao et al. [30], who further investigated the dispersion of expiratory aerosols in such case through Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. In addition, as the temperature difference increases within a reasonable range, the corresponding mass fraction will increase (Fig. 3), which can be attributed to the stronger buoyancy forces. On the other hand, the concentrations of the upper flat did not change linearly according to the increase of temperature differences, and the mass fraction may stop increasing as the temperature difference exceeds a specific threshold. This can be explained by the dual roles of natural ventilation in built environments, namely a positive role of dilution and a negative role of transmission [28].",

Actually, the pollutants from a lower flat may re-enter into other flats further above [29]. As for a multi-storey HRR building, the cascade transport driven by buoyant plumes has not been studied and discussed either. Besides, for the existing CFD simulations, the airflow field was generally obtained based on steady-state models with heat released constantly from the internal walls, while the buoyancy-driven natural ventilated flows are inherently unsteady [30]. Thus, more sophisticated modeling, including the location of heat source, is needed to provide more accurate predictions, which is expected to be explored in the future.",

Fig. 4\nshows the general airflow pattern around a bluff body, which has been thoroughly examined by many researchers [58], [59]. As wind impinges a building, airflow separates at building edges, generating recirculation zones over downward surfaces and extending into the downwind wake. The flow pattern near the windward wall is divided into three regions: a front stagnation region at about two-third of the building height, an upward separation region above it, and a downward vortex region below it. At leeward walls, a kind of vertical vortices is formed with a general flow direction from bottom to top. In general, various flow patterns, such as impingement, separation, reattachment, recirculation, vortex-shedding, etc., are involved along the building surface. Therefore, unlike the unidirectional transmission process in the buoyancy-dominated case, the wind-driven inter-flat transmission behaviors can be varied depending on the pollutant source location and the contaminant concentration distribution along the building surface.",

Then, Liu et al. further designed detailed experiments to investigate such dispersion mechanism regarding mean concentrations with residents' behavior of window opening [33] and concentration fluctuations [34]. Considering the uncontrollable atmospheric conditions during on-site measurements and the scale problems of wind tunnel tests [70], [71], Ai et al. performed numerical simulations to study the wind-dominated inter-flat dispersion in a multi-storey slab-like building in terms of mean process using the optimized RNG model with the two-layer near-wall model [37], [38], and transient process using LES model [40].

The simultaneous effect of temperature and wind on the air exchange and ventilation process at an opening is very complicated, especially for the single-sided case. Although many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to understand the single-sided natural ventilation driven by the combined buoyancy and wind effects regarding the airflow rate [57], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], such understanding is yet limited for application. In particular, after the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, many researchers have tried to address the mechanisms of disease spread [20], [21], [26]. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether the buoyancy or wind effect played a more significant role. Hence, a full understanding of the single-sided natural ventilation under combined buoyancy and wind effects is extremely important to reveal the inter-flat airborne transmission mechanisms.",

Such ambiguity makes it hard to observe consistent trends and to deduce general airflow processes. Nevertheless, some encouraging results have been obtained from Allocca et al. [57] by tracking the velocity patterns through a room at a range of wind speeds, as shown in Fig. 8(b). At a low wind speed (v\n1), buoyancy effects dominate and drive air in through the lower part and out through the upper part. At a wind speed of v\n2 (v\n2 > v\n1), such buoyancy effects diminish as the wind forces increase, resulting in a smaller airflow rate. When the wind speed increases to v\n3 (v\n3 > v\n2), the wind forces become dominant and drive a counterclockwise flow. As the wind speed continues to increase (v\n4), the wind forces further grow stronger and the buoyancy effects are nearly negligible. Similar changes between the wind- and buoyancy-dominated cases can also be observed in other studies [74], [75], [76], which further investigated the effects of indoor/outdoor temperature differences and opening conditions. Thus, it is important to note that the combined effect should be studied case by case due to the complicated interaction between related parameters.",

Firstly, wind may increase the intensity of outdoor turbulence and further increase the interfacial mixing between incoming and outgoing airstreams at the middle of the opening [75], [77]. Such mixing layer tends to increase the airflow rate. Secondly, the approaching wind speed profile may attenuate the net pressure difference across the opening, indicating a counteraction between wind and buoyancy forces [29], [75]. Thirdly, wind turbulent fluctuations may contain high frequency energy, which can reinforce the air exchange through the opening [78]. Thus, the general behavior of weak wind in terms of the single-sided natural ventilation is far from clear at the current stage.",

[29]. In spite of the slight difference in their assumptions, some positive findings can be deduced from the comparison. Firstly, both studies have demonstrated the re-entry possibility, namely the inter-flat cross-contamination within the same building exactly exists no matter what physical effects drive the ventilation. Secondly, when the wind speed is extremely low or high, both results show the same order of magnitude in re-entry ratios, indicating that both experimental and numerical studies can quantitatively describe the consistent trends under buoyancy- or wind-dominated cases. Thirdly, when the buoyancy effect is comparable to the wind effect, a large discrepancy can be observed. Gao et al. [29] revealed that the wind may first reinforce the upward transport and then suppress such spread as the speed increases, while the on-site measurements by Niu and Tung [26] did not capture such reinforcing phenomenon. There are two explanations regarding this discrepancy in addition to the complexity of weak wind effects as discussed above. One reason may lie in the modeling simplification of real conditions. In the simulations, only the wind normal to the window with heat released constantly from the internal walls was taken into account by Gao et al. [29], while the real airflow along the fa\u00e7ade was fairly turbulent and flow directions varied drastically, as reported by Niu and Tung [26]. The three-dimensional nature of airflows and the vertical temperature gradients are incompatible with simple assumptions such as one-dimensional flows and constant temperatures in both flats, as explained by Heiselberg et al. [79]. In addition, the inherent inability of the RNG k-\u03b5 model used by Gao et al. [29] to reveal the turbulent fluctuations and instantaneous air exchanges through the opening may be another reason for such discrepancy.",

[34] suggested that the infection risk caused by instantaneous peak concentration can be neglected. However, their conclusion may only be implemented to similar HRR buildings with a cross (#) floorplan, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Moreover, simulation results by Ai and Mak [40] using LES on a slab-like building pointed out that: 1) the incursion of pollutants into a specific flat is intermittent, 2) secondary dispersions are observed, and 3) a flat with a very low mean re-entry ratio could occasionally experience extremely high re-entry ratios. These findings further extend the dispersion scope and highlight the dispersion uncertainty for inter-flat cross-contamination, which were unfortunately ruled out by the inherent time-averaged treatment of previous RANS models [27], [28], [29], [30], [37], [38]. Thus, more transient investigations are needed to fully describe the inter-flat dispersion process.",

For a specific flat, the number of infectious quanta can be provided by the re-entry portion of infected air generating from the source flat. The re-entry portions in various scenarios are reviewed and analyzed in Section 3. However, existing studies have not provided a general secure threshold for the re-entry ratio to quantitatively evaluate the infectious risk for a specific flat by this kind of cross-contamination. This is due to the diverse pathogen types and different physical conditions of susceptible people [40]. Although previous researchers [42], [86] have studied the possibility of causing disease by pathogens, the results are shown to be strongly case-dependent. When exposed to a certain concentration level of a specific pathogen, isolating infectors as early as possible is nevertheless an effective method to reduce exposure time and control infection.",

An airborne infection is caused based on the prerequisite that at least one quantum produced by an infector must remain airborne and survive to be inhaled by a susceptible person [9]. If the survival time of a pathogen is shorter than the time required for quantum accumulation in a target flat, the occupants in this flat are safe and thus need no protective measures. Unfortunately, many pathogens can survive airborne for long periods, such as 24 h for influenza viruses [87], 7 days for SARS coronavirus [88], etc., which are longer than the timescale of inter-flat dispersion. On the other hand, many factors may affect the survival time of a pathogen [9], [43]. To the authors' knowledge, the two timescales have not been systematically compared and analyzed to evaluate the infectious risk with the concerned inter-flat dispersion. Therefore, the need to analyze the two timescales for a specific pathogen is meaningful to obtain more accurate risk estimations in a certain built environment.",

In order to evaluate the wall thermal boundary condition around a building, it is necessary to consider the total (atmosphere + buildings + ground) thermal energy balance and their interactions. However, there has been less conclusive work on this case, partly due to the difficulty in resolving or parameterizing the thermal boundary layers on building surfaces in simulations [98], and the challenges in capturing heat transfer processes on the building and district scales [99]. Nevertheless, it is important to address these technical issues because of the increased emphasis on accurate modeling of building and ground surface temperature and near-ground atmospheric boundary layer.",
