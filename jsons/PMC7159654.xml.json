Samples were excluded that had previously tested positive for rotaviruses or that scored less than 3 on the diarrhoea severity score. The decision to assay the more clinically severe diarrhoeal samples was supported by the observation that bovine noroviruses have been found to be more commonly associated with watery faeces.12 Although samples testing positive for rotavirus were excluded from the pools in our study, mixed infection with bovine noroviruses and bovine rotaviruses have been described previously,12 so these results likely underestimate the frequency of bovine noroviruses in our sample set.",
