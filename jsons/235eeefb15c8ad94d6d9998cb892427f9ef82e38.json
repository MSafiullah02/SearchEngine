It results in immunity for the vaccinated individuals, but it also reduces the infection pressure for unvaccinated people. Thus people may actually escape infection without being vaccinated: the so-called \"herd effect.\" We analytically study the relation between the herd effect and the vaccination fraction for the seminal SIR compartmental model, which consists of a set of differential equations describing the time course of an epidemic. We prove that the herd effect is in general convex-concave in the vaccination fraction and give precise conditions on the epidemic for the convex part to arise. We derive the significant consequences of these structural insights for allocating a limited vaccine stockpile to multiple non-interacting populations. We identify for each population a unique vaccination fraction that is most efficient per dose of vaccine: our dose-optimal coverage. We characterize the solution of the vaccine allocation problem and we show the crucial importance of the dose-optimal coverage. A single dose of vaccine may be a drop in the ocean, but multiple doses together can save a population. To benefit from this, policy makers should select a subset of populations to which the vaccines are allocated.

A large outbreak brings about deaths, health losses and economic losses. Research on preventing an epidemic or mitigating its consequences is thus of high priority. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of a sudden epidemic.

It measures the total number of people infected during an epidemic. An implicit analytical expression for the final size can be derived from the Kermack and McKendrick model (cf. Diekmann et al. 2012) . This final size equation may be shown to hold for a broad range of model specifications Shattock 2012, Ma and Earn 2006) . Our objective also corresponds to minimizing the final size: an extension of the final size equation serves as the starting point of our analysis. In contrast, Cairns (1989) and Goldstein et al. (2009) investigate how to minimize another epidemic characteristic: the basic reproduction ratio R 0 (cf. Wallinga et al. 2010) . R 0 is defined as the number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. In the initial phase of an epidemic there are very few infected individuals, so the population is almost completely susceptible. R 0 is therefore related to the exponential initial growth rate of an epidemic (cf. Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007) . Other studies analyze vaccine allocations that result in the threshold R 0 = 1 (e.g., Becker and Starczak 1997, Tanner et al. 2008) . Duijzer et al. (2016) consider vaccination before an outbreak in an age structured population and minimize the required vaccine stockpile to achieve R 0 = 1.

This secondary effect is nonmonotonic, because it consists of two competing phenomena: (i) Vaccination lowers s(s), thus reducing the further reduction in susceptibles needed until s(t) reaches 1/r and (ii) Vaccination reduces the rate of initial exponential growth of infected people, thus inhibiting the speed of reduction of s(t). For small f the second effect dominates, resulting in a delayed peak as can be seen in Figure 2 . For larger vaccination fractions, when s(s) comes close to 1/r, the first effect dominates rendering the peak to be advanced. A delayed peak is beneficial, since more time allows for more recoveries and consequently results in fewer infections at the peak.
