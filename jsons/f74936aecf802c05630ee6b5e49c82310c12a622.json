Seventeen patients (52%) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70%)] and cough [13 (39%)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61%)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4%). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic. ",

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. As of February 25, 2020, a total of 77785 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in China. A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan City, and then it confirmed as the . pathogen of COVID-19 /A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan City, was confirmed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as the cause of COVID-192.

The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever [23 (70%) of 33 patients], cough [13 (39%)], and myalgia or fatigue [14 (30%)]; less common symptoms were sputum production [0%) of 33] developed dyspnoea. By comparing the Hunan's data with Wuhan's (the area with the most severe outbreak of COVID-19 in China), we found that the clinical symptoms of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hunan were significantly different from those in Wuhan. The fever rate of newly diagnosed patients in Hunan area is lower and the temperature of most patients is below 39\u2103(94%). Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 did not cough in the early stages of infection . It is worth noting that patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Hunan rarely have difficulty breathing at first diagnosis, only with slight shortness of breath or chest tightness. However, more than half of patients (55%) in Wuhan suffer from dyspnea. (Table 2 and Figure 1) The blood counts of patients on admission showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count less than 1\u00d7 10\u2079 /L; 17 (61%) of 28 patients) , while the white blood cell count was usually normal (5.23\u00d7 10\u2079 /L (1.95-26.68)). The level of d-dimer in Hunan's [median D-dimer level 0.92 mg/L (0.8-1.11)] was higher than that in Wuhan's [median D-dimer level 0.5 mg/L (0.3-1.3)]. Levels of alanine amino transferase [28.85 U/L (22.68-41.25)] and aspartate amino transferase [30.95 U/L (22.7-42.53)] in Hunan showed no statistical significance with Wuhan's. Total bilirubin [73.15 mmol/L 218.25-315.8) was increased in the most patients. These reminded the function of liver, heart and kidney will be slightly damaged. The serum levels of procalcitonin on admission of most patients is normal [0.074 ng/mL (0.0445-0.09025)]. However, patients usually manifested higher C-reactive protein [5.23 mg/L (1.95-26.68)]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM did not rise in all patients and we also did not find cases of co-infection between Influenza A/B virus and SARS-CoV-2. Cycle threshold of respiratory tract [Ct=32.77 (26.3-36.9)]and stool [Ct=34.64 (28.59-36.0)]were below the reference value (Ct=37). (Table.2) On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among most patients. The Report of CT results of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan area originated from Pan, Y et. al 10 . Of the 19 patients in Hunan , 6 (31.6%) did not show obvious abnormalities. The typical findings of chest CT images of patients [6 (31.6%)] were patchy/punctate ground glass opacities(Figure 2b). Only two patient's CT images performed ground glass opacity, patchy consolidation and fibrous stripes(10.5%)(Figure 2a). Compared with patients in Wuhan, the pathological changes in the lungs J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of Hunan patients were milder in CT(69.4%) and chest radiographs (62.5%).",

This may be rare related to the second-generation infection of the virus outside Wuhan. In an early report in Wuhan, China, 2-10% of COVID-19 patients developed symptoms of diarrhea.

Such findings have more positive significance for the global prevention and control of COVID-19.All COVID-19 patients are negative in Influenza A/B virus nucleic acid, and this phenomenon suggesting there may be interference between J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f viruses. When two viruses infect the same cell or body, the phenomenon that one virus inhibits the replication of another virus is called interference11 , and the specific mechanism needs further research.Due to various factors such as specimen type, collection method, transportation, and performance limitations of the kit, the positive rate of RT-PCR screening for new coronary pneumonia is not ideal. The total positive rate of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection is about 60%, which sometimes cannot meet the clinical requirements. However, the specificity of chest CT diagnosis of COVID-19 is only 25%. As the disease progresses, the specificity of CT will be lower, and it is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 from general pneumonia. The rate of missed diagnosis of nucleic acid detection is high, and there are many patients in Wuhan, at this point, CT screening showed its advantages. It can help detect patients as soon as possible, and then the patients will be isolated and treated as soon as possible. It is affordable to combining CT screening and nucleic acid detection because of the fewer patients in Hunan and other places.During the initial screening process, a comprehensive analysis of the patient's epidemiological history, symptoms, and laboratory tests isrequired. If necessary, further chest CT or combination with nucleic acid testing is performed. The laboratory nucleic acid test is a crucial tool for detecting viral pneumonia anytime. If the Hunan area hospitals adopt J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clinical COVID-19 diagnosis measures similar to Hubei area, it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate. During the epidemic period, the lower lymphocyte count of the test results is more suggestive. Pharyngeal swabs and stool simultaneous nucleic acid testing are still the first choices for early diagnosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Hunan. Interestingly, we also found that four patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 without clinical symptoms. All of them have a history of Wuhan sojourn or contact with relevant people. Therefore, suspectedinfected patients without clinical symptoms still need to be excluded via nucleic acid testing. Screening of crowd who contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients is currently recommended, what's more systematic screening of crowd outside of health care facilities and avoiding cluster activities should be encouraged 12 .
