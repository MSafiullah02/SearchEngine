Hippocrates was the first to use asthma as a medical term referring to lung spasm in his teachings entitled, The Corpus Hippocraticum (Marketos 1982). In ancient China, inhaled preparations of ephedrine containing plants were used to stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors within the lung, which continues to be a mainstay mechanism for the treatment of asthma (Chang et al. 2013). In the 1860s, Dr. Henry Salter of London described the classic characteristics associated with asthma, such as airway hyperresponsiveness to cold and exercise, as well as environmental particulates (Sakula 1985).",

The classic symptoms of asthma include chest tightness, wheeze, cough, and dyspnea, which may resolve spontaneously or in response to treatment (Moorman et al. 2012) (Table 1). Definitive criteria for the diagnosis of asthma do not exist (Li et al. 1998). The term asthma encompasses a spectrum of pulmonary diseases sharing the hallmark of reversible airway obstruction and can be classified as allergic or non-allergic (L\u00f6whagen 2015). Asthma resulting from an IgE-mediated immunologic mechanism is designated allergic, while those not associated with IgE are classified as non-allergic and consist of many phenotypes (Romanet-Manent et al. 2002).",

Recurrent airflow limitation is driven by inflammatory mediators leading to bronchoconstriction, airway edema, hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling. Bronchoconstriction is the result of bronchial smooth muscle contraction in immediate response to an inhaled irritant or allergen (National 2007). While classically complete reversal of airway obstruction is indicative of asthma, many cases of asthma may only have a partial reversal in airflow and in some cases no reversal of obstruction. The fixed airway obstruction may in part be due to airway remodeling. Investigations are still underway to understand the exact pathophysiology of this; however, upregulation of growth factors by the bronchial epithelium seems to be the key in the persistent inflammation, smooth muscle hypertrophy, collagen production, neovascularization, basement membrane thickening, and increased myofibroblast and fibroblast activity (Busse et al. 2000).",

Key cytokines in this cascade include IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5, the latter of which is the primary signal for the differentiation of eosinophils. Eosinophils prolong and potentiate persistent airway inflammation by releasing leukotrienes, granule proteins, and GM-CSF. This is consistent with postmortem histopathology showing eosinophilic infiltration into the mucosa and the airway and mucous plugging of the airway lumen (Busse et al. 2000).",

In both the proximal and distal airways, epithelial detachment, goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, infiltration of inflammatory mediators, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy, and vascular changes are all observed (Hamid 2003). Despite these consistent changes, the course of asthma is variable in its severity and progression over an individual\u2019s life and between individuals. For the majority of patients, asthma begins early in life with risk factors for development including atopic disease, recurrent wheezing, and parental history of asthma (2). ",

Viral infections and airborne allergens are two of the most important environmental factors leading to asthma development, persistence, and possibly asthma severity (NHLBI 2007). Though allergens and other environmental factors are a strong trigger for many with asthma, complete avoidance is often impossible, and despite avoidance asthma often remains active. For those not responding to avoidance, treatment is based on symptom frequency and severity of disease. Quick relief medications are inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and anticholinergics. Long-term control medications are used to treat persistent asthma and include inhaled long-acting beta2- agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, and oral leukotriene modifiers and methylxanthines. Those that fail to respond to conventional therapy noted above may respond to biologic agents depending on their phenotypic classification of asthma (AAAAI 2017). Allergen immunotherapy is also an option when there is a clear association between asthma symptoms and perennial and/or seasonal allergens (NHLBI 2007). Vaccination schedules should be adhered to in order to decrease infectious triggers.",

One phenotype is chronic bronchitis, which is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by a chronic cough occurring for 3 continuous months a year for at least 2 consecutive years (Monetes 2012). Emphysema is another subtype resulting from the permanent loss of alveoli (Montes de Oca et al. 2012). Without the alveoli the airway loses the recoil from the parenchyma necessary to keep the airway patent. The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a phenotype inclusive of both clinical syndromes (Foreman et al. 2007). The diagnosis of ACOS is clinical, and with most of the key symptoms being shared between pure COPD and asthma, it further adds to the challenge of accurately making this diagnosis (Saetta et al. 1994; Barnes 2002) (Fig. 1).",

Emphysema may be ascertained by using a CT scan of the chest, demonstrating classic COPD findings of emphysema such as vast destruction and dilation of alveoli. By comparison in asthma, the alveoli are not destroyed, but instead air is trapped within the alveoli due to bronchial obstruction. The result in asthma is decreased ventilation, but the surface area capable of gas exchange remains intact with a normal DLCO (Miravitlles et al. 2000). ",

GERD can present in several different ways and at times can resemble asthma as suggested by the extraesophageal manifestations. In some asthmatics, reflux serves as a potential trigger or contributing factor for asthma (Harding 1999). There is no gold standard diagnosis for GERD. Upper endoscopy shows characteristic esophageal changes in only 40% of cases (Nwokediuko 2012). GERD may be differentiated from asthma with pH probe and/or barium swallow (King 2008).

Pulmonary carcinoid tumors compromise 2\u20135% of all lung cancers and are most commonly located centrally in the main or lobar bronchi (Hage et al. 2003; Filosso et al. 2002). Symptoms of pulmonary carcinoid tumors include hemoptysis, cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and lower respiratory tract infections (Schrevens et al. 2004; Zuetenhorst 2005). There is typically a delay in onset of symptoms to time of diagnosis, and patients are often misdiagnosed with asthma (Walusiak 2002; Dipaolo 1993; Wynn et al. 1986). Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is classified as a premalignant condition. It causes wheezing, cough, and dyspnea with relatively poor response to inhaled therapy but with improvement in systemic corticosteroids. Thus, this premalignant lung condition may be confused with asthma. Octreotide or other somatostatin analogs can reduce symptoms.",

The dispersed antigens must be a size that is appropriate for reaching the alveolar spaces (5 \u03bcm or less) (Selman 2012). These antigens include mammalian and avian proteins, fungi, thermophilic bacteria, and chemical compounds that can combine with host proteins to form haptens (Selman 2012).

As respiratory findings are common, this disease process is in the differential diagnosis of asthma, especially in the premenopausal female. LAM should be considered in a patient with dyspnea, cough, and chest pain (Johnson et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2016). LAM can often mimic COPD, asthma, and bronchitis, which may lead to a delay in diagnosis. The natural course of this disease is usually varied, and affected women are at high risk of developing pneumothorax, rapid decline of lung function, progressive respiratory failure, and death (Taylor; Johnson et al. 2016).",

These diseases must be considered in the differential of asthma, since they may present with dyspnea, wheezing, and cough (Loffler 1956). Eosinophilic lung disease may be characterized by peripheral eosinophilia with supportive pulmonary radiographic findings, eosinophils demonstrated on lung biopsy, or increased eosinophils in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Allen 1994; Bain 1996). Peripheral eosinophilia with an absolute eosinophil count of 500 cells per microliter or greater supports an eosinophilic pulmonary disease (Valent et al. 2012). The degree of eosinophilia does not enable diagnosing the precise etiology (Umeki et al. 1992). A high-resolution CT scan of the chest can provide significant findings early in the course of the disease (Johkoh et al. 2000). L\u00f6ffler syndrome is one of many diseases classified as an eosinophilic pulmonary disease. It occurs when helminth larvae migrate to the lungs of an infected individual to mature before ascending the airways and return to the gastrointestinal tract (Wilson 2006). There are four types of helminths with life cycles within the lung: Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Strongyloides stercoralis (Wilson 2006). The syndrome was originally described by L\u00f6ffler when patients presented with fleeting pulmonary opacities with peripheral eosinophilia after being exposed to soil contaminated with human waste (L\u00f6ffler 1956).",

The diagnosis of GPA is confirmed with biopsy. Tissue from the upper respiratory tract can be obtained with less risk; however, the yield of upper airway biopsies is relatively low. Lung biopsy or renal biopsy, if kidney involvement suspected, is often the best way to diagnose this disorder. Treatment is focused on long-term immunosuppression.",

Careful attention to history as well as the physical examination and selected imaging, spirometry, and/or laboratory facilitates the appropriate classification and diagnosis in the subject with suspected asthma. Corticosteroid therapy typically used for asthma may improve many of the conditions in the differential diagnosis.
