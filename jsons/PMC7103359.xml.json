Millions of people suffer from ARI, mainly during the colder seasons, every year. Fortunately, most cases are self-limited and evolve toward healing without the need for an etiological treatment. About twenty viruses have been involved as causative agents of ARI. Excepting infections caused by emerging viruses such as MERS-coronavirus (CoV), SARS CoV or new influenza viruses (Flu)], severe cases that require special attention and management rarely occur. Patients within the extreme stages of life, i.e. infants and elder adults, and/or individuals with underlying conditions or risk factors are mainly affected by a more severe infection. On the other hand, specific antiviral therapy is only available for Flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.",
