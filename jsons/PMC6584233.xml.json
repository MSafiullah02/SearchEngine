Incomplete KD is defined as prolonged unexplained fever without meeting at least three of the above five criteria [2].",

The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of KD has been controversial [5-7]. The association with super antigens such as staphylococci or streptococci has been constantly argued [8-10]. In KD, incomplete type of KD and coronary artery complications occur more frequently in patients with streptococcal or other bacterial/viral infections [11-13]. Some reports have stated that systemic inflammation is linked to acute coronary events, including endothelial dysfunction [14,15]. We hypothesized that KD patients diagnosed with streptococcal infection have poor prognosis, especially in terms of treatment response and the development of coronary artery lesions.",

All except one patient diagnosed with KD received IVIG (2 g/kg) for 12 hours and these blood tests were performed 36 hours after the end of treatment. Only 1 patient did not receive IVIG, because he was referred to our hospital without a fever. Blood culture, throat swab, respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serum Mycoplasma antibody tests were performed in patients who were suspected of having an infection. Respiratory viral PCR can detect 12 respiratory viruses and subtypes included the following: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza 1,2, and 3, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Serial echocardiography exams were performed during hospitalization by an expert pediatric cardiologist. By correcting for BSA, a z score system provided by Kobayashi et al. [16] was used in our study. In this study, z score \u22652.5 was regarded as a coronary artery abnormality.",

[11] reported that patients with KD who also had respiratory viruses have a higher frequency of coronary artery dilatation and were more often diagnosed with incomplete KD. Other researchers have linked streptococcal infection and the KD [21,22]. In particular, the reason might be clinical overlap between streptococcal infection and the KD, such as persistent fever, a desquamative rash, and erythema of the mucous membranes in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A superantigen-mediated process might be related to this process [8]. Matsubara and Fukaya [8] suggest that KD is a response to superantigens in genetically susceptible individuals. These all support our results that KD with streptococcal infection had a severe clinical course.",

In Japan, several group A streptococcal serotypes showed a bimodal distribution, with peaks in December to February and again in May to June and a prominent nadir of infections in September [23]. In Korea, a seasonal pattern was observed in which KD occurred more often in early summer (May, June, and July) and winter (January and February), and occurred less often in the spring and fall [24]. Of the 11 KD diagnoses, 4 were made in early summer (2 in May, 1 in June, and 1 in July), and 3 were made in winter (1 in January, 2 in February). No patients were diagnosed in the fall.

However, there are significant difficulties assigning a \u201cnormal\u201d ASO titer value. The only upper normal limit is >320 IU/mL, presented in a recent study and many other studies [20]. Also, ASO titer does not always indicate a recent streptococcal infection. Therefore, an increase in an ASO titer is indicative of a preceding group A Streptococcus infection, so sequential measurements are recommended [17-19]. We attempted to obtain 2 sequential measurements, but only a single sampling was performed in some patients. IVIG contains the pooled immunoglobulins from the plasma of approximately a thousand or more blood donors. As a cocktail of different antibodies against various virulence factors including Streptococcus, it can be provided to the patients. In this study, among 11 patients, 5 patients\u2019 ASO titer was high (range, 506\u20131,023) at the time of diagnosis, and 6 patients\u2019 ASO titer elevated after IVIG treatment.",
