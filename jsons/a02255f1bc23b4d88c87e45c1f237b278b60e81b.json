IR attendings were assigned to a new ICU-based team to provide bedside venous access options for COVID-19 patients, while a more formalized ambulatory team of an IR trainee and attending was created to perform routine bedside procedures including US-guided paracentesis, thoracentesis or drainages in suitable COVID-19 positive and negative patients to minimize patient transfer to reduce the risks of transmission during transportation.

This report details the impact of COVID-19 on an IR division in a tertiary academic medical center during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may provide insights and information to other centers located in COVID-19 epicenters. The fall in cases within IR likely mirrors the significant changes in work patterns and caseloads across multiple specialties, something that has already been reflected in preliminary studies published elsewhere [6] . As the pandemic continues, we plan to continue to follow this early signal and re-allocate our resources to areas that require most urgent support.

IR nursing staff, all of whom are critical care trained, were redeployed to staff newly created ICUs within the hospital. IR technologists were reassigned to meet the increased demand for portable chest radiographs, both on inpatient floors and newly created ambulatory respiratory assessment clinics. By contrast, in the outpatient IR suite, the number of assigned RNs remained the same, and the number of technologists increased by 50% (2 v 3).This study has some limitations. First, this study did not report patients' COVID-19 status. All non-urgent/emergent interventional cases in COVID-19 positive patients were deferred or performed at the bedside per hospital policy to decrease the risks of transportation and staff exposures. Only one COVID-19 positive patient had a catheter exchange procedure performed during the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the authors intend to follow up this study with a more focused on the COVID-19 cohort as the pandemic evolves. Second, bedside venous access placement in the ICU by IR physicians during 2019 was not reported. Traditionally, the vast majority of temporary venous access placements in the ICU is performed by ICU physicians, and IR is only responsible for tunneled catheter placements in the IR suites. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the newly created ICU-based venous access team placed all temporary catheters in the ICU. Therefore, this new bedside procedures performed by IR during the period under review.",
