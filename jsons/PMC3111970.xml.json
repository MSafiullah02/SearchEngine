In addition to appropriate blood compatibility testing by blood typing and cross matching, infectious disease screening of the donors and donated units is crucial to assure the quality of blood components. Although strict guidelines ensure that only healthy donors are used, there is still the potential that donors can have subclinical viremia, bacteremia, or parasitemia and that the organisms could be transmitted via transfusion to a patient. Patients receiving blood transfusions are often debilitated and/or immunocompromised; therefore, transmission of infectious organisms can be a particularly devastating complication of transfusion therapy. Because emerging infectious diseases can potentially be transmitted through blood component transfusion, new screening technologies and schemes are being introduced in human and animal blood banks.",
