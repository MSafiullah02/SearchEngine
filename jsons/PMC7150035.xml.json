In general, water is often taken lightly in most food preparation and processing operations. Water has a wide variety of uses in food production, for cleaning, sanitation, and manufacturing purposes. In addition to being an ingredient in many foods, it may be used for various other operations, such as for growing, unloading, fluming, washing, brining, ice manufacture, and in sanitation and in hygiene programs. Water quality has great detrimental impact on products and operations in food production systems. The fundamental importance of water quality in food production is often underestimated. This underestimation generally becomes the underlying cause for several problems, such as mismanagement of water, equipment operation, and maintenance issues; loss of revenue; food safety; and product quality.",

Food safety is a very broad term. It covers many aspects of handling, preparation, and storage of food. Water is an inherent component in food production. In-depth understanding is required to know the impact of these factors on food safety. Every care in detail is essential to prevent illness and injury from the viewpoint of food production. Food production also covers chemical, microbiological, and microphysical aspects of water and food safety. Therefore, for adequate control of food chemical quality, control of allergens that can be life threatening to people who are highly sensitive to such allergens gets top priority in ensuring food safety. Any pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms may produce toxins, which act as possible contaminants of water used in food production and that therefore affect food safety. At times, microphysical particles such as glass and metal, when present in water, can be hazardous and cause serious harm to consumers.",

Adequate treatment of the water is necessary to ensure that it meets a drinking water standard which is safe to be used in food production (i.e., safe for human consumption). The food industry is supplied drinking water primarily in two ways.

Food production from the livestock sector has diversity such as meat (beef, pork, poultry, and others), dairy products, and fishes, aquatic or sea food.

The most logical reason lies in the fact that animals are secondary consumers in the food chain; therefore, in the calculation of water footprint of animals always adds up inherent increments of primary consumers. Twenty-nine percent of the total water footprint of the agricultural products in the world is related to the generation of animal products. One third of the global water footprint of animal production is related to beef cattle (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010).",

The on-going shift from traditional extensive and mixed farming to industrial farming systems is likely to continue to meet this rising demand for animal products. This intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems.

On an average, it takes 2\u20134 L/day to satisfy the biological needs of drinking water of a human being. This may be around 1000 times as much water as required to produce the food for normal person. Therefore, the concept of virtual water is so important when discussing food production and consumption.

It is recommended that hot water immersion should be at 77\u00b0C (170\u00b0F) for at least 30 seconds for manual operations. For single tank, single temperature machines, a final rinse at temperature of 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F) is required, and for other machines it is 82\u00b0C (180\u00b0F) (Schmidt, 1997).

In such situations, minerals are deposited in the form of film or scales on the hard surfaces which are in contact with such water for a long time. To prevent the buildup of various such mineral deposits, water conditioners are used. These conditioners are chemicals that usually act as sequestering agents or chelating agents. These sequestering agents work by forming soluble complexes with calcium and magnesium. Examples of some common water softeners are sodium tri-polyphosphate, tetra-potassium pyrophosphate, organo-phosphates, and polyelectrolytes. Some chelating agents include sodium gluconate and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA).",

It is essential that to have healthy and hygienic food, the water used must be of very high quality. It is very essential that analysis of water with stringent quality control criteria must be followed at every point of food processing, packaging, and storage. In Europe, it is mandatory for the food industry to have an adequate supply of drinking water for use in food production to ensure that foods are not contaminated. Drinking water means that it is fit for human consumption, not only for drinking, but also suitable for cooking as well as for food preparation. In principle, this must be devoid of microorganisms and other contaminants that may jeopardize public health (WHO, 2017a). Water safety can never be taken lightly. Unsafe water, which results due to direct contamination or improper or inadequate water treatment processes, generally results in a contaminated food product.

Giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are the second largest cause of water-borne disease, due to transmission of microscopic parasites or cysts of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Giardia is found worldwide and is within every region of Canada and the United States. The third top most water-borne disease is dysentery caused either by Entamoeba histolytica amebic dysentery and/or by salmonella and shigella bacillary dysentery. Dysentery kills around 700,000 people worldwide every year. Salmonella bongori and Samonella enteric are gram negative rod bacteria with >2500 serotypes or serovars known to cause the water-borne salmonellosis. Each year, almost 1 in 10 people fall sick and that results in loss of 33 million of healthy life years. It is one of the four key global causes of diarrheal diseases.

Viral hepatitis caused by the A virus is largely an endemic disease with transmission through water. Epidemics of A virus can be explosive and cause substantial economic loss. Similarly, the viral hepatitis caused by the E virus (HEV) can result in epidemics if common community water sources get polluted. It is estimated that there are 20 million HEV infections worldwide each year, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis-E.

The solution is meta-stable for up to a couple of weeks and like chlorine-dioxide generated onsite. The disinfectant contains mainly hypochlorous acid, smaller amounts of chlorine-dioxide, and ozone. Small quantities of these will be dosed into the water system. Several manufacturers claim that this is a chemical-free method for water treatment.

Heavy metals are mostly the by-products of mining ores. They are present not only in the soils of mines and in the immediate surroundings of metal processing plants but also in far-off urban areas (Horv\u00e1th et al., 2015). Heavy metals also lixiviate into soils from landfills that contain industrial and household wastes and from sewage sludge that comes from wastewater treatment plants. In recent times, E-wastes, or wastes associated with electronic appliances, are assuming larger source of metals like lead, strontium, mercury, cadmium, and nickel in the soil (Robinson, 2009). Urban soils are susceptible to significant accumulations of heavy metals from activities like coal burning, automobile exhaust, erosion of metal structures, and refuse incineration (Horv\u00e1th et al., 2015). In the agricultural sector, the use of fertilizers, manures, and pesticides have all contributed to the accumulation of heavy metals in soils (Mishra et al., 2016). Arsenic has been used in pesticides, and the buildup of arsenic in orchard soils has become a major problem as it is known to persist for decades (Walsh et al., 1977).",

It is true and widely accepted that the use fertilizers and pesticides has greatly improved grain production.

However, soil also serves as a home for many pathogenic organisms. More than 400 genera of bacteria have been identified together with as many as 10,000 species. These bacteria, with the exception of viruses, in most cases, are more abundant than any other organism in soils (Nieder et al., 2018). Around 300 soil fungi species, out of the vast numbers of more than 100,000 fungi species that occur in soils, are known to cause disease in humans (Bultman et al., 2005, Nieder et al., 2018). For instance, the soil fungus Exserohilium rostratum caused a fungal meningitis outbreak in the United States in 2012 (Brevik and Burgess, 2013). Most of the protozoans that are found in soil feed on organic matter, including bacteria and algae; however, a few of these cause human parasitic diseases like diarrhea and amebic dysentery (Brevik et al., 2018). Soil serves as a common reservoir for helminthes. Helminths are parasites that may inhabit the human intestines, lymph system, or other tissues. Helminthic diseases require a nonanimal intermediate host like humans for transmission. Billions of people are infected by helminths worldwide each year, with an estimated 130,000 deaths annually (Abdeltawabi et al., 2017). Helminth infections generally occur via ingestion of contaminated water and food, and in most cases it involves intestinal infection (Nieder et al., 2018). Soil is not a natural reservoir for viruses; however, viruses are known to survive and stay in a dormant state for years together in soil. Pathogenic viruses are generally introduced into soil via human septic or sewage waste. Viruses that cause communicable diseases like conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, polio, aseptic meningitis, or smallpox have all been detected in soil (Bultman et al., 2005, Hamilton et al., 2007, Nieder et al., 2018).",

Efficient use of soils to deal with and solve several groundwater contamination issues is not a recent idea. It has been rediscovered with the ongoing research and developments in soil sciences. In many countries, food safety policies are not integrated with soil and water pollution management policies (Lu et al., 2015). Therefore, it is very essential that a comprehensive map of both soil and water pollution threats to food safety should be prepared together with implementation of integrated policies addressing soil and water pollution.

Instead of using the natural breeding methods that farmers have used for centuries to select for desirable traits, GMO crops and GMO animals are actually radically altered genetically to repel pests, withstand droughts, and grow faster. These changes are patented and help corporations to increase their control over the seed supply. However, they rarely have any interests of people or the environment in mind. The relevance of genetic manipulations in the food production may not be overlooked. In view of the present scenario of water use and availability for primary food production, in majorities of the countries in the world, it becomes a necessity to develop more water efficient crops and livestock.",

Although it is a highly controversial topic, it may be viewed and if ethically used, it is an emerging highly promising technology. This genetic technology, if carefully regulated and tested, should have much-desired beneficial effects in terms of water conservation. The most logical approach in the genetic modification, for example, should be the selection of the traits to increase the rate of photosynthesis, depth of root structure, as well as a decrease the transpiration rate at which water is lost. This strategy should increase the nutrients yield of the crop and at the same time decrease the water requirement of the staple cereal crops. These changes have the great positive potential to lower pressures on the amount of global water resources required in food production. The enormous potential and the promising possibilities of genetic engineering and biotechnology research and development have the better future solutions to the current problems of water conservation, specifically in primary food production. Therefore, more precise and highly controlled and targeted genetic modifications should be very helpful in wheat, rice, and maize to increase their water efficiency and drought resistance. This approach will work more effectively by implementing genetically altered crops into the advanced and water efficient agricultural system.",

One example of drought tolerant wheat is SeriM82, also known as \u201cstay-green wheat.\u201d This new variety has deeper root systems that lead to greater water uptake. It has been shown that this increased water uptake during drought periods gives 14.5% increase in yield compared to the traditional variety (Manschadi et al., 2006).\n",

In food production processes, water quality and its impact on products and operations are generally underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of income, food product quality, and safety. The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water, compared to any other sector. The water footprint of any animal food product is larger than the water footprint of a plant product with equivalent nutritional value. In the world, 29% of the total water footprint of the agricultural sector is related to the production of animal products. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water as compared to cereals, vegetables, or fruits. The global meat production has almost doubled since 1980, and this trend is likely to continue given the projected doubling of meat production up to 2050. The shift from traditional extensive and mixed farming to industrial farming systems is likely to continue to meet this rising demand for animal products. Due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems, intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product. The pressure on the global freshwater resources will therefore increase both due to the increasing meat consumption together with the increasing blue and gray water footprint per unit of meat consumed. Therefore, the biggest opportunity and challenge for future water management for us is to store more green water in soil and plants, as well as to increase the storage as blue water.\n",
