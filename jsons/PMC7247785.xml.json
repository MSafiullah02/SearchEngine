In addition to the possible lack of parental support at home, major inequalities arise in the access to digital learning resources. With the aim of ensuring continuity, inclusion, and equity for all students, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has launched the Global Education Coalition, calling for coordinated and innovative actions to support students through remote learning and to guide the school reopening phase, thanks to the involvement of public and private stakeholders.",

With students at home, the school community is absent and despite the virtual interactions and learning opportunities provided by the internet and social networks, a barrier is created in the educational relationship between pupils and teachers. Moreover, children are missing a physical space in which to share interests, thoughts, hopes, and emotions among peers. School provides a structured setting in which children can learn and develop social competencies, such as self-confidence, friendship, empathy, participation, respect, gratitude, compassion, and responsibility. Social and emotional learning is important for young people to become conscious members of a solidarity-based community.2 Learning objectives can be achieved remotely (and evaluated to some extent), but the core mission of any school system also comprises the promotion of students' wellbeing, which is closely related to school performance.2, 3\n",
