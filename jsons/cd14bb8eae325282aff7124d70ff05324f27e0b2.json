Starting already in January, the epidemic spread outside China, first in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and in the United States, and in many cases it was connected to recent travelers to the country. In Europe, Italy had the first official community-based case on February 20, and, very quickly, clusters of cases developed in the Lombardy region. It was later discovered that the virus had been circulating in Lombardy since at least early January (Cereda et al., 2020) , and, possibly, since December. From mid-March, the vast majority of countries in the world had multiple cases, with the centers of the outbreak moving first to Europe and, later, to the United States.",

A minority of countries initially experimented with laxer restrictions, either based on a misguided attempt to have their populations achieve herd immunity on their own (the U.K., which soon moved away from the policy), or because of an unwritten 'social contract' with citizens, rather than enforcement from policymakers (Sweden).

To measure the extent of pairwise country social connections, we use data obtained from Facebook, which measure the total number of friendships across pairs of countries, as a fraction of the total number of combined users in the two countries. This Social Connectedness indicator allows us to have a measure that can account for different types of relationships: regular friendships, business links, family ties, relations based on older and more recent patterns of immigration, and tourism flows. Social networks can help explain the transmission of COVID-19 cases across borders, and they are likely to represent a superior measure compared with the use of geographic distance alone. 1 Other contemporaneous papers make a similar observation (e.g., Kuchler, Russel, and Stroebel, 2020). At the same time, social networks not only can potentially explain patters of disease contagion, but also spillovers in ideas and behavior. Controlling for the country-specific dynamics of COVID-19 cases, people's risk perceptions may respond differently and also be affected by the experience and perceptions of individuals in their networks of social connections, including those residing abroad. The same is true for responses in terms of social distancing: individuals who had large connections to countries where the virus outbreak and the social distancing responses were already happening, may have learned from their early experiences, taken the epidemic more seriously, and responded similarly.",

Data from Google Trends have become a popular way to measure people's attention to certain events or to track realtime developments (related to epidemics, diseases, or the economy, for example) that would be hard to measure otherwise. We also analyze the early economic effects implied by the health shocks and the associated social responses. To have a measure that is connected to unemployment, but available daily, we similarly use Google searches about the Unemployment Topic (again, including all searches related to unemployment, such as 'unemployment benefits', 'unemployment insurance', 'how to apply for unemployment', 'losing my job', and so forth). Askitas and Zimmermann (2009) and Choi and Varian (2009), among several others, show that unemployment searches provide a useful early real-time indicator for actual unemployment releases, which are, instead, available only at monthly frequency and with a publication lag.",

As a result of social distancing, unemployment may increase. The model allows us to treat all these variables as endogenous: this is necessary since social distancing, for example, is likely implemented in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, but it also has itself an impact on the future number of cases. Moreover, domestic variables in the model are also allowed to respond to foreign aggregates. The foreign variables enter each domestic model with weights that depend on the matrix of social connections: the relevant foreign aggregate for each country is different, since the patterns of connections are unique to the country. In the GVAR literature, the domestic models can be estimated separately as conditional VARs. All endogenous variables can then be stacked together to form a large-scale Global VAR; it is then possible to track the responses of all variables to each shock in each country. Through the use of a connectivity matrix (our Social Connection matrix), the Global VAR model offers a relatively simple and parsimonious way to deal with potentially complex interactions across different variables and countries.",

Many papers use the leading model in epidemiology, the SIR (or, alternatively, the extended SEIR) model based on Kermack and McKendrick (1927) , to simulate the evolution of the disease (e.g., Ferguson et al., 2020). In economics, a number of recent papers have adopted a similar framework and developed the theory further by adding relevant trade-offs between health and economic costs (e.g., Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt, 2020, Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi, 2020, Jones, Philippon, and Venkateswaran, 2020). This paper, instead, takes a different route by providing empirical evidence related to the social response to the outbreak, and using an alternative framework. In contrast to studies using the SIR model, we do not aim to predict the evolution of the number of infected individuals in a population; our focus lies more on explaining the social responses to the original health shocks around the world.",

Our unemployment variable can be interpreted as a real-time signal for unemployment, or, alternatively, as a measure of people's perceptions, attention, or fears, about unemployment over the time period that we study. 5 Finally, we measure international social connections using Facebook's Social Connectedness data. The index uses active Facebook users and their friendship networks to measure the intensity of connectedness between each pair of locations.

The data used in this paper refer to the measure calculated for March 2020. Bailey et al. (2018) proposed the measure to study the effects of social networks across U.S. counties. Other current papers are uncovering the link between social networks and the diffusion of Covid-19 (e.g., Kuchler et al., 2020). The measure can be preferred to alternatives based simply on inverse geographic distance, since it can provide a more accurate account of business relations, tourism patterns, and family or friendship ties, across different areas. We argue here that the strength of social connections can also affect information about the outbreak and social distancing responses. For Italy, the strongest social connections are with Switzerland and Slovenia, followed by Austria, Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the U.K. Distance is clearly a determinant of social networks, but not the only determinant. Social connections are stronger between Italy and Australia, Italy and the U.S., and Italy and Canada, than between Italy and Turkey, although the latter is geographically much closer.",

The GVAR specification can be seen in relation to a number of econometric alternatives: spatial VARs, panel VARs, and dynamic factor models. Spatial VARs are very strongly connected. They also assume a connectivity matrix, which is usually based on geographic distance. The main difference between the two approaches lies with the structure of correlations: as discussed at length in Elhorst et al. (2018), spatial VARs may be preferred when correlations across units are extremely sparse, for example, when a unit is only affected by few bordering units (\"weak\", or local, cross-sectional dependence). The GVAR is meant to capture stronger interrelationships, with dense connectivity matrices, where each country unit is affected, in different ways, by several other countries, or by an aggregate measure (\"strong\" cross-sectional dependence). Spatial VARs can also be seen as a particularly restricted case of a GVAR model. The approach can similarly be seen as a particular form of panel VAR. The main advantage here is that, through the weight matrix W i , it allows us to exploit knowledge about social networks and use it to inform the magnitude of cross-country interdependencies. Panel VARs often impose the same coefficients for each unit, shutting down static and dynamic heterogeneity, as well as neglecting cross-country interdependencies. An exception is provided by Canova and Ciccarelli (2009): they introduce a factor structure in the coefficients to solve the curse of dimensionality. Their approach is particularly useful when there is no a priori knowledge that can be exploited about the spillovers. In our case, the extent of social networks can be, instead, exploited to provide some information about the relative strength of interdependencies. Finally, the GVAR has relations with dynamic factor models. As Chudik and Pesaran (2011) show, the GVAR specification approximates a common factor across units, and it extracts common factors using structural knowledge.",

Those countries, at different times, have accounted for a large share of global cases. We allow the Covid variable for all other countries to be affected by foreign series. We also allow risk perceptions in each country, as well as social distancing outcomes, to be affected even contemporaneously by corresponding variables in different countries. Finally, we assume that domestic unemployment perceptions are affected by foreign unemployment perceptions, but not within the same day.

Painter and Qiu (2020) and Adolph et al. find that political beliefs affect compliance with social distancing indications in the U.S. Andersen (2020) finds evidence of substantial voluntary social distancing and he also shows that it is affected by partisanship and media exposure.Our paper provides a contribution to the literature on GVAR models (seeChudik  and Pesaran, 2016, for a survey). Most papers in the literature consider macroeconomic applications and study the global spillovers of policy and other shocks (e.g., Pesaran et al., 2004, Chudik and Fratzscher, 2011, Dees et al., 2007). Others have studied interdependencies in housing markets (Holly, Pesaran, and Yamagata, 2011), firm-level returns (Smith and Yamagata, 2011), and a variety of other applications (Di Mauro and Pesaran, 2013)",
