The snowball sampling method was used to recruit participants (Goodman, 1961). We selected an initial set of five participants, ensuring a broad range of age, gender, occupation, education, and geographical area. Each participant was asked to choose five people they consider suitable for the survey and to send them the questionnaire. Further participants were reached out in the same way until data saturation. Efforts were made to recruit subjects from all Italian regions, which had been affected by the pandemic to different extents, so to have a representative sample of the Italian population. The survey was anonymous, and data confidentiality was assured. Eligible participants were aged 18-75, had lived in Italy for at least four weeks from February 2020, were fluent in both written and spoken Italian, and had at least five years of education. Exclusion criteria were: non-Italian language speakers; current hospitalization; a history of mental disorder. The study followed the European Survey Research Association (ESRA) guidelines. All participants completed the questionnaire online via EUSurvey. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Rome.",

To fit our aims, we subdivided our sample into three groups according to K10 cutoffs: 1) subjects without likelihood of psychological distress, 2) subjects with likelihood of mild psychological distress, and 3) subjects with likelihood of moderate-to-severe psychological distress. Analyses used standard univariate/bivariate comparisons of continuous measures (ANOVA) and categorical measures (contingency table/\u03c72) to compare factors of interest (including sociodemographic, AAS, and temperament characteristics) in the three groups. We used a statistical model corrected for multiple comparisons according to the Bonferroni procedure (p<0.05/number of comparisons) to minimize the likelihood of type I statistical errors. Factors significantly associated with mild or moderate-to-severe psychological distress in bivariate analyses subsequently underwent a multiple multivariate logistic regression to generate Odds Ratios (ORs) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), with no psychological distress risk/ mild psychological distress/ and moderate-to-severe psychological distress as dependent outcome measures. We examined possible multicollinearity between variables of interest by ensuring that the variance inflation factor (VIF) indicator obtained from linear regression analysis was <4.

            "text": "The documented connection between viral epidemics and psychological distress dates back more than 100 years ago, when Menniger linked the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic with psychiatric complications (Menninger, 1919). People's emotional responses during massive infectious disease outbreaks are likely to include feelings of extreme fear and uncertainty that, along with the separation from loved ones and the limitations of freedom, may eventually lead to dramatic mental health burden (Brooks et al., 2020). Hence, we conducted a survey to investigate the Italian population's psychological response during an early phase of the epidemic. Our findings indicate that 38% of the general population is currently perceiving a form of psychological distress. Similar results were observed both in online surveys conducted on the Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic (Li et al., 2020) and among the Italian general population following previous natural disasters (Dell\u2019Osso et al., 2013). However, the majority of subjects in our sample displayed no relevant distress. This might be due to the still relatively short exposure to the pandemic, as well as to individual features promoting resilience (Mukhtar, 2020).",

On the one hand, anxious temperament, as a trait-like phenotype, is characterized by increased behavioral and physiological reactivity to mildly stressful stimuli and is more prevalent in women (Akiskal and Akiskal, 2005). On the other hand, gender is an important biological determinant of vulnerability to psychosocial stress, in addition to genetic, socio-cultural, hormonal, and developmental factors (Wang et al., 2007). Our results indicate that males are, to a certain degree, less likely to develop psychological symptoms in the face of a stressful event. Similarly, a recent survey conducted in China one month after the COVID-19 outbreak reported higher post-traumatic stress symptoms in women (Liu et al., 2020).",

A function of attachment is to regulate distress (Bartholomew and Horowitz, 1991) and evidence suggests that quality of early caregiving experiences and AAS may affect stress responsivity, both at a physiological and psychological level (Kid et al., 2011). Anxiously/avoidantly attached individuals are less able to regulate their emotions, as opposed to securely attached subjects, so that several strategies have developed internally to reduce or manage any distress experienced. Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991) described anxiously-attached individuals as overly dependent on others and in constant need of attention, in contrast to those high in avoidance who may feel uncomfortable in social interactions. A possible explanation to our results is that while subjects with anxious style overreport distress to ensure care will be provided, individuals with an avoidant attachment may appear as if they are very calm in a distressing situation while their internal experience may be quite the opposite. Alternatively, individuals with prominent avoidant attachment features, who tend to be self-directed, and often do not exhibit distress upon social separation, might perceive self-isolation, as well as social distancing preventive measures, as less stressful compared to anxiously-attached individuals.",
