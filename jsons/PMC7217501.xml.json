Bagnoli and others [26] showed that individual protection triggered by risk perception can stop an epidemics from spreading in several network topologies, including a moment-diverging scale-free (provided that the perception response is nonlinear). However, awareness by spreading phenomenon models the word-of-mouth propagation of an information about the epidemics. Funk and others [20] showed that, for an SIR epidemics, the spreading of awareness through individual contacts could avoid an epidemic outbreak, whereas a global awareness could only reduce the outbreak size, but not stop it. Wu and others [27] also studied the influence of global awareness, risk perception and contact-spreading awareness in an SIS epidemics, showing that the local (but not the global) awareness could raise the epidemic threshold.

Due to this state, Granell and collaborators [21] show that there is a metacritical point for the epidemic threshold values, and that a global source of information (regarded as a mass media campaign) can eliminate this metacritical point, as it causes the awareness to be always present [22].

This is a limitation, as many real-world phenomena do not occur at the same rates. For instance, the HIV infection and renewing cycle has a typical timescale of many years, whereas the information and awareness about HIV can be spread and forgotten several times during this period. Moreover, important discoveries were obtained by flexibilizing relative timescales between simultaneous processes. For example, Oliveira and Dickman [31] determined that the competition between two biological species may be won by that with a slower birth/death rate under certain environmental circumstances. G\u00f3mez and collaborators [32] showed that the diffusion on a two-layer network can be possibly faster than on each individual layer, if the diffusion timescales inside and between the layers are different. It may, therefore, be of great value to consider that epidemic spreading and the propagating awareness about it occur at different timescales.",

Granell [21,22] applies a simple SIS epidemic model for the awareness, in which spreaders stop propagating the information by forgetting it (analogous to the disease healing). These approaches capture the essential phenomenology, but may be not as accurate in reproducing the real-world behavior, in which people may know the information but loose the interest in propagating it. This can be considered using rumor models\n[33\u201335], in which a compartment of individuals called stiflers is used to represent people who does not want to propagate the information that they have.",

First, we increase the complexity of previous models with respect to the dissemination of information by considering the dynamics of the Maki-Thompson [44] rumor model\u2014instead of using the traditional dynamics of disease spreading [21,22]. Second, we introduce a parameter that allows to control the relative timescales between the disease and rumor propagation processes. Results for scale-free networks show that the rumor dynamics can indeed reduce the epidemic prevalence. However, if we couple the characteristic time for awareness diffusion with the state of individuals, namely, by considering that infected individuals take more time to inform about its own infection, a counterintuitive behavior is revealed: The prevalence increases with the rate at which individuals become aware, despite the fact that fraction of unaware individuals decreases. The latter mechanism is important, as there are many diseases to which a similar behavior can be associated\u2014e.g., HIV transmission, where HIV-positive patients are often reluctant to voluntarily notify their sexual partners [45]. In what follows, we present the model as well as some analytical insights and results from numerical simulations.

Notice that the latter R here is used for the stifler compartment to avoid confusion with the susceptible (S) state in the SIS model. A stifler is an informed node who does not propagate the information anymore. When an aware (spreader) node contacts an unaware (ignorant) neighbor in the informational layer, it tries to pass the rumor about the disease. If the contacted neighbor, however, is an aware or stifler node, then the node that makes the contact becomes stifler. A stifler individual can also forget the information about the disease transmission, becoming ignorant about the disease transmission again. We again use a discrete time approach [47] by considering a reactive formulation in which, at each time step \u0394t=1, each aware (A) node first tries to inform each of its unaware (U) neighbors with probability \u03b3, and then becomes a stifler (R) with probability \u03c3. Besides, each stifler node becomes ignorant (U) with probability \u03b1.",

Using these overall states, we define the interaction between the epidemics and awareness by adding two new features. First, a susceptible node that is informed (aware or stifler) will reduce its contagion probability by a factor \u0393 (with 0\u2264\u0393<1) for each contact, meaning that it will get the disease from each of its infected neighbors with probability \u0393\u03b2 (less than \u03b2). Such a feature represents the adoption of prevention methods against the disease. Second, an additional transition called self-awareness is considered: If not informed by a neighbor, then an infected-unaware (IU) node can, during the same time step, become aware with probability \u03ba, by knowing its own condition. This process simulates the case in which an infected subject recognizes the symptoms of the disease and becomes aware of the infection.",

That is, a node who knows about its own infection does not inform other nodes and also impair the transmission of other nodes, creating additional stiflers around it. This behavior is approximately observed in the case of HIV transmission, in which some infected individuals knows about its own infection but do not voluntarily notify their sexual partners [45], acting as infected-stiflers. We include this feature by reducing the probability that an infected-stifler node forgets the information by a factor of (1\u2212\u03ba) (so that the self-awareness parameter also reduces the rate at which infected-stiflers become infected-unaware).

To understand this, we look at the susceptible population: If most susceptible individuals are unaware of the disease, the information is concentrated at infected nodes and thus is not effective in controlling the disease. In Fig. 5, we study the relative distribution of the susceptible population between unaware (SU), aware (SA), stifler (SR), and the combination of the previous two (SA + SR), using the modified model only. For the case of slower information (\u03c0=0.1), the fraction of informed susceptible nodes (SA, SR) increases with \u03ba, as expected. However, when \u03c0=0.9, the opposite happens: The fraction of SA and SR decreases and the fraction of susceptible-unaware (SU) nodes increases, meaning that the fraction of susceptible nodes that are protected by the information decreases with \u03ba in this case. Therefore, even if the unaware population is reduced with \u03ba [as reported in Fig. 4(b)], the information is actually concentrated at infected individuals, making the protection inefficient. In other words, the fraction of informed individuals always increases with \u03ba but, for large \u03c0, susceptible individuals become less informed as \u03ba increases, and thus the number of infections increases.\n",

We have considered the Maki-Thompson rumor model for the propagation of the information, which incorporates a forgetting mechanism not included in previous related models. Besides, the rumor and disease spread at the same time but under different timescales that control the relative speeds of these two processes. We have verified that the information helps to reduce the prevalence and increase the epidemic threshold of the disease. We have also observed that self-awareness, which keeps infected individuals aware of their condition, is a very effective mechanism for reducing the disease prevalence. However, in the case that the information spreads much faster than the disease, large values of self-awareness can lead to the counterintuitive result of a higher prevalence. This happens because the self-awareness can generate such an excessive number of stiflers that impair the propagation of information, with the overall effect of increasing the prevalence. Therefore, the relative timescales between the information and infection processes determines whether the information awareness is beneficial or not for the magnitude of the epidemics. In this way, our work highlights the important role played by infected individuals who help spreading the information about the disease, reducing the disease transmission and the outbreak.",
