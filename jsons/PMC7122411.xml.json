These hematophagous arthropods parasitize every class of vertebrates in nearly all areas of the world [1] and represent one of the most important mediators of zoonoses to humans. In the past decade or more, there have been global expansion and emergence of several tickborne diseases: Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and others. Moreover, new tickborne diseases continue to be discovered in recent years, such as novel phleboviruses of the family emerging separately in Asia, Europe, and North America. One of these viruses was first recognized in China in 2010, presenting in patients with fever, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction, called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV] [2]. A closely related phlebovirus, called Heartland virus, was subsequently discovered in 2012 to cause a similar clinical syndrome in 2012 in Missouri, United States [US] [3].",

These comprise of two major families: the Ixodidae or hard-ticks because of their sclerotized, hard dorsal plate, which represent the most important group medically and numerically, and the Argasidae or soft-ticks because of their flexible cuticle. A third family consisting of a single species, the Nuttalliellidae, is confined to southern Africa [1]. Ticks have three stages in their life cycle: the larval, nymphal, and adult forms. Hard-ticks and soft-ticks differ morphologically and in their life cycle and ecology. Ixodid ticks have several advantageous attributes for transmitting infectious pathogens as vectors more than soft-ticks or argasids. Ixodid ticks feed for long periods [several days], firmly attached to the host, and remain unnoticed as their bite is painless, and their feeding hosts include a large variety of vertebrates in diverse habitats [1]. Argasids, conversely, feed briefly and often on a single host species, and they live in dry areas, mostly in sheltered habitat near their hosts [1]. It is believed that ticks evolve about 225 million years ago in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic eras, initially parasitizing reptiles [8].",

Each stage of the tick attaches and feeds on a single host over several days; then once satiated it detaches and finds a resting place to molt to the next stage. The larva and nymph are the main transmitters of diseases, as the adult feeds only briefly and the males may not feed at all. Ixodid ticks actually spend >90% of their life cycle unattached from the host and mainly live in open areas of meadows but are transported to woods by their hosts [9]. These ticks exhibit active host-seeking behavior by climbing plants and attaches to passing animal hosts or emerge from their habitat and attack nearby animals [1].",

Some tick species are host specific, feeding only a limited variety of animals, but this may vary with the stage, and some ticks have different host for each feeding stage. In general the animals in their habitat influence host selection and diverse species of ticks have different affinities for attacking humans [10]. The relationship with ecology or environment, natural animal inhabitants and host specificity or range, and geographic distribution are all interrelated with respect to the life cycle of these ticks. The brown dog tick, , for instance, is well adapted to the vegetation and climate in the Mediterranean region and other areas with similar conditions such as Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, and parts of Brazil, all regions where the brown dog tick can transmit rickettsial pathogens. Each feeding stage of R. sanguineus has high specificity, and it readily feeds on dogs and is important vectors for Mediterranean spotted fever in the Mediterranean region, and occasionally Rocky Mountain spotted fever in southwestern US and Mexico. In contrast, Ixodes scapularis [black-legged deer tick] in the US and [European sheep tick] in Europe are adapted to the woods and forests with relative high humidity and are sensitive to desiccation from dry places. Ticks inhabiting wooded areas, I. scapularis, I. ricinus, Amblyomma american [lone star tick], and others, feed on different host species, such as small and large mammals and birds [1, 11].",

Soft-bodied ticks [argasids] are inhabitants of sheltered environments, nests, caves, burrows, and primitive man-made shelters. Unlike ixodids, they lack cement from the salivary glands for firm attachment but produce anticoagulants and cytolytic substances to facilitate brief multiple feeding times [1].

Humans and domestic animals\nare incidental hosts that result from infringement of the usual circulation between wildlife and tick vectors in their natural habitats. The risks of tickborne diseases vary geographically and are determined by the climate, environment, presence of rodents and other vertebrate reservoirs, and the species of ticks parasitizing wild and domestic animals [28]. These zoonoses can emerge in previously non-endemic areas when climate conditions and circumstances favorable to the maintenance and transmission arise. This may include displacement of the hosts of vectors and reservoir animals by human expansion and development. Birds are important reservoirs for several pathogens and act as vehicles for infected ticks and probably play an important role in the dispersal of tickborne zoonoses [29]. Although for each pathogen one or more tick vectors and several animal reservoirs may exist, various combinations of coinfection with different microbes may coexist, and studies have demonstrated mixed infection in ticks of 7\u201310.9% [29, 30]. For example, the black-legged deer tick [I. scapularis], from the northeastern and upper midwestern US, can be coinfected and transmit multiple pathogens to humans such as Lyme and myamotoi borreliosis, anaplasma, babesia, and Powassan virus. Concurrent infection by two or more tickborne microbes is fairly common and frequently detected in clinical and veterinary practice [31]. Coinfection with multiple pathogens may be transmitted by ticks simultaneously during the same blood meal or at separate times. The natural reservoir hosts of many microbes [B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti] transmitted by Ixodes ticks are rodents, which are often coinfected with multiple organisms and may transfer the microbes to the larvae or nymphs and then to animals and humans [32]. Simultaneous coinfection of several pathogens may result in diverse host responses, which can conflict and antagonize each other, allowing the pathogens to synergistically infect the host more successfully, with more prolonged and severe disease with multitude of clinical manifestations, than normally reported with a single pathogen infection [33]. Sequential infection with a new microbe\nmay allow the establishment of a new infection which otherwise may not have occurred because of elimination by the host immune defense mechanisms [31].",

Serosurveillance studies of populations in hilly regions of China showed that 1.0\u20133.8% of people had SFTSV antibodies [47\u201349]. There is also evidence that the virus has been circulating naturally in some regions of China showing seasonal variance with most cases occurring from May to July, and clinical disease occurred mainly in older subjects [92%] [50]. It has been estimated that the annual incidence of disease is about 5 per 100,000 of the rural population [49]. Seroprevalence and asymptomatic viremia of SFTSV in blood donors from endemic regions have also been reported. In a study of 17,208 blood donors, seropositivity ranged from 0.27% to 0.54%, but very low-grade viremia was detected in only two subjects [51]. Overall, SFTS is mainly reported from rural areas of central and northeastern China from May to September, targeting farmers >50 years of age [52]. Subjects were predominantly affected from farming-related exposures and numerous domestic and wild animals were infected by SFTSV [53].",

Viral RNA of SFTSV was also detected in H. longicornis ticks at all stages of its life cycle, indicating both transstadial and transovarial routes of transmission and the ability of ticks to play a role as a vector and a reservoir of the virus [60]. In a study from South Korea, 13,000 ticks were examined for SFTSV from nine provinces, and the minimum detection rate in H. longicornis was 0.46%, with the highest prevalence in the southern region [61]. In South Korea SFTSV was also detected in other hard-ticks at lower rates, and [62], and in China the virus was also detected in mites from field mice and goats in endemic regions [44].

The viruses from animals and those from patients and ticks shared 95.4% of the genomic sequences [65]. Many wild animals such as deer, hedgehog, weasel, possum, and some bird species are hosts for the vector ticks and could carry the virus. However, rodents are known reservoirs of many bunyaviruses, but the rates of infection of rats [3.03\u20138%] with SFTSV are lower than in livestock [48, 66].

In a study of 298 confirmed cases of SFTS and 55 followed after convalescence, during the first week of illness, there was a loss of T, B, and NK lymphocytes which were subsequently restored, but severe disease was associated with slower recovery and lower humeral immunity [77]. SFTSV-specific IgM antibody could be detected within 9 days, peaked at 4 weeks, and persisted for 6 months. IgG antibody could be detected in most patients within 6 weeks, peaked at 6 months, and persisted for at least 3 years [77]. There is also evidence that SFTSV is capable of infecting monocytes and suppresses IFN-beta and NF-kappa B promoter activities, facilitating the virus replication in human monocytes by restricting the innate immune response [78]. The virus can also disrupt type 1 interferon signaling by the nonstructural protein-mediated sequestering of signal molecules [STATS I and II] into inclusion bodies [79]. IFN-\u03b2 production is an important host defense mechanism against viral pathogens, and inhibition of this response has been reported with other bunyaviruses [80, 81].",

Newborn mice and rats, especially Kunming mice, are highly susceptible to SFTSV, and infected mice demonstrate pathological changes with large areas of necrosis only in the liver, but the virus can be detected in numerous organs [84]. Interferon-\u03b1/interferon-\u03b2 knockout mice are also highly susceptible to infection with the virus, with 100% mortality in 3\u20134 days after inoculation [85]. The virus is found in numerous organs with heavy viral burden in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen but no detectable histological changes. It appears that C57/BL6 mouse may be a better model for SFTSV infection, as the animals demonstrate leucopenia and thrombocytopenia similar to humans [86]. Moreover, histopathological changes were found in the spleen, liver, and kidney, but the spleen appears to be the primary target as viral replication could be demonstrated in this organ. The thrombocytopenia is probably caused by virus-bound platelets that underwent phagocytosis by splenic macrophages [86]. Nonhuman primates are considered the gold standard animal models for studying human disease pathogenesis, and a recent study has been reported by infecting rhesus macaques. SFTSV infection of did not result in severe disease symptoms\nor death but caused fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated transaminases and cardiac enzymes [87]. Minor pathological lesions were found in the liver and kidney during the late stages of infection, and elevation of inflammatory cytokines was present in the blood. Thus, infection of this primate model resembles mild SFTS in humans.",

The major stages of the disease recognized include an initial febrile flu-like illness, a second stage of multiorgan failure, and a subsequent convalescent phase [44, 52]. The first stage of the disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever from 38 to 41\u00b0C, headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, associated with high viral load, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and elevation of transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. This stage may last for 5\u201311 days but may resolve after a week and enter a convalescent phase in patients with mild disease. The second stage occurs after 5 days\nand in more severe disease progress to develop multiorgan failure, first involving the liver, then the heart, lungs, and kidneys, which can persist for 7\u201314 days or lead to death [44, 90]. Coma may occur in about 6% but as high as 27% and confusion is seen in 22\u201336% [44, 52]. A recent report of 538 patients with SFTS described development of encephalitis in 19% of cases, with a fatality rate of 44.7% in this subgroup [91]. In nonfatal cases the biomarkers start to decrease with decline of the viral load and improvement of the platelet count by day 9\u201311, whereas in fatal cases the viral load, biomarkers, and thrombocytopenia continue to increase. The overall case fatality rate of 2500 reported cases in China averages at 7.3% [44], but the initial report was 12\u201330% [39].",

Prognostic factors for disease severity and outcome of SFTS are related to host factors, clinical manifestations, and laboratory parameters. Age is a key factor in the severity of disease and outcome, with older age carrying a worst prognosis [44, 52, 90]. Children rarely become infected [possibly from less tick exposures and more robust immunity] and those who become infected manifest mild symptoms with fever, malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms, and minor laboratory abnormalities [92]. Clinical features associated with adverse prognosis include neurological manifestations, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [93]. Host immune responses and viral replication are important factors in determining clinical severity and outcome, and high viral load in blood at admission is associated with a worst prognosis and fatality [93]. Laboratory parameters associated with poor prognosis and fatality include hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, coagulation disturbance, elevated transaminases, elevated creatinine, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated lactic dehydrogenase\nlevels in the late stage [94, 95].",

More recently a fatal case of HRTV infection was described in 80-year-old male on a farm in Tennessee [100]. The patient had a history of multiple tick bites, with detectable tick on his body 2 weeks prior to onset of illness, and had comorbid conditions of chronic obstructive lung disease and alcoholism. He presented with weakness, fever, and altered mental status, and tests showed persistent leucopenia, progressive thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated transaminases. His clinical course deteriorated on broad-spectrum antibiotics and subsequent hypotension, hypoxia, and renal dysfunction occurred before his death. Autopsy findings were largely nonspecific and the bone marrow revealed myeloid hyperplasia and trilineage hematopoiesis. Although this fatal case resembles severe cases of SFTS, there was no evidence of necrotizing lymphadenitis as described in fatal cases of infection with SFTSV, but the spleen demonstrated white-pulp depletion\nand scattered immunoblasts [105].

Blood samples from acutely febrile patients presenting to primary care offices, emergency departments, or urgent care clinics in 2013\u20132014, requesting testing for tickborne infections, were sent to IMUGEN [Norwood, Massachusetts] [111]. Whole blood PCR for presence of specific DNA sequences of common tickborne pathogens and BMD were performed. Among 11,515 patients tested, 97 BMD cases were identified by PCR. Most of the patients presented with fever, chills, marked headache, myalgia, or arthralgia, and 24% required hospitalization [111]. Elevated liver enzymes [82%], leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia were common, and symptoms resolved after doxycycline and patients treated with amoxicillin or ceftriaxone\nalso improved. Serology for the acute diagnosis of BMD was poor, as only 1 of 39 cases with circulating DNA had B. miyamotoi IgM and none with IgG, but convalescent sera were reactive in 78%. In this study of acute febrile patients, BMD was confirmed less frequently than babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis.",

The differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness after tick exposure is quite diverse and largely depends on the local region or geography at the time of exposure. For instance, in the US, there are 14 tickborne diseases listed by CDC, and now there will be 15 with the addition of Bourbon virus [see Table 5.1]\n",

Despite these known preventative measures, for decades tickborne diseases have continued to flourish with worldwide expansion and emergence. Thus, new approaches for prevention of tickborne infections are needed. Directed mass education of targeted at-risk populations [farmers, outdoor campers, hikers, etc.] in endemic areas may be of benefit to inform the public of the risk of these diseases and preventative measures, including large visible signs in these areas. Development of specific vaccines for these various pathogens is not feasible nor would be cost-effective due to their relatively low frequency. However, it may be worthwhile to evaluate new strategies such as a vaccine to prevent tick bites that could be used to prevent many tickborne diseases. Anti-tick vaccines could potentially reduce tickborne infections by reducing the tick burden or interference in host-tick-human transmission by vaccination\nof the vertebrate hosts [115]. Anti-tick vaccines would be environmentally safe, unlikely to select resistance as compared to insecticides, and can include multiple antigens to target a broad range of ticks [116].",
