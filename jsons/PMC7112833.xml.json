These new reagents have opened new opportunities in several fields, such as gene-expression studies, high-throughput screening and medical diagnostics. However, a relatively high percentage of reported analytical bioassays describe only the basis of the method but lack the corresponding application to the analysis of real samples. The suitability of these assays in the presence of sample matrices has not been established, because there are still several limiting factors, such as non-specific adsorption or binding, size variation, aggregation, and lack of stability and solubility. Also, although some NPs can be ideal labels for use in multiplexed immunoassays, the inherent cross-reactivity of antibodies remains a major shortcoming.",

            "text": "Noble-metal NPs, mainly gold (AuNPs), have been widely used in numerous bioassays involving optical or electrochemical detection. They exhibit bright colors due to the presence of a plasmon-absorption band that is not present in the spectrum of the bulk metal, which is a result of the resonance of the incident photon frequency with the collective excitation of the conductive electrons of the particle. This effect is termed localized surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) and depends on the size, shape and composition of the NPs, the distance between NPs and the refractive index of the environmental medium [2], [3]. Another feature of these NPs is their capability to produce surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effects [5]. Also, the redox properties of AuNPs have led to their widespread use as electrochemical labels in protein and nucleic-acid detection, with numerous configurations being explored [3], [4], [6]. The different and interesting properties of AuNPs have been widely explored in bioassays using a variety of detection systems, which are summarized in Table 1. These bioassays usually utilize AuNPs as optical or electrochemical labels to detect the target molecule, using direct, competitive or sandwich formats, as described below, although, in some instances, they act only as nanoscaffolds to increase the sensitivity of the assay, as is the case for many electrochemical sensors [4], [6], [7], [8].",

Briefly, these NPs show broad excitation profiles and narrow emission peaks and can emit in a range of wavelengths by changing their size and composition. Also, they lack photobleaching and have long fluorescence lifetimes. However, QDs can show blinking characteristics when they are excited with high-intensity light, which could be a limiting factor for fast-scan systems, such as flow cytometry. Other limitations are toxicity, size variation, agglomeration and non-specific binding. Surface oxidation of QDs can occur under combined exposure to aqueous/UV-light excitation, which can lead (e.g., in CdSe-based QDs) to the release of cadmium ions, so that these NPs are inadequate for in vivo applications, such as in vivo drug-delivery assays. However, they offer better imaging results than those achieved by organic dyes in cell-based or tissue-based drug studies [9], [13].",

These NPs enable significant amplification of the analytical signal due to the numerous dye molecules inside each NP. Also, the interest in using these NPs in bioanalysis lies in the versatility of silica in synthesis and surface modification. Compared with polymer-based NPs, silica NPs show less aggregation and little leakage. Also, the silica surface favors the dispersion of the NPs in aqueous solution. For example, silica-based NPs functionalized for coupling and containing stable lanthanide chelates have been widely used in bioassays [2], [17], [20], since they are photostable, present sharp emission spectra, wide Stokes shifts, long fluorescence lifetimes and lack inner-filter quenching. Also, the surface of these NPs can be easily modified without altering their properties significantly. These lanthanide-doped silica NPs have been usually used for the development of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays, in which near-infrared acceptors are used to avoid background signals. Silica NPs containing ruthenium(II) chelates, mainly tris(2,2\u2032-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) (RuBpy), have also been used in several bioassays with fluorescence or chemiluminescence (CL) detection [18], [21].",

Another sensor used Fe2O3/Au-magnetic NPs [41], in which the antibody was covalently immobilized, and the NPs were attached to the surface of a carbon-paste electrode with the aid of a permanent magnet. AFP was directly determined by the change in current or potential before and after the immunochemical reaction.
