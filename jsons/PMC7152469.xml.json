Sailboats and yachts are best known for niche travel, such as \u201ceco-touring.\u201d River cruises are popular for providing an informal, intimate atmosphere while traveling to places such as the Nile and the Amazon. Ocean cruises make up the greatest portion of ship-based leisure travel, with the North American cruise industry accounting for the major part of the global ocean cruise market. The North American cruise industry consists of cruise lines that market cruises primarily to North Americans but have embarkation ports worldwide. The Caribbean remains the top cruise destination, followed by Alaska, the Mediterranean, and other parts of Europe. Depending on the type of cruise, the duration can range from hours (e.g., gambling cruises) to several months (e.g., round-the-world cruises). The average duration of a cruise is 9 days, and approximately 58% of cruising passengers choose 6\u20138-day cruises. The typical 7-day cruise allows passengers ample time to visit three to five ports and explore different locales and cultures.1\n",

Further spread, resulting in large numbers of illnesses, mainly occurs by person-to-person transmission of the virus.16 Most NoV outbreaks can be characterized by high attack rates, a high prevalence of vomiting, short duration of illness, and confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The key to controlling the spread of NoV on cruise ships is the rapid implementation of infection control measures at the first signs of an AGE outbreak; these include hand-washing before eating and after bathroom use plus frequent cleaning of common areas, staterooms, elevator buttons, and hand rails, and limiting guest contact with serving utensils in buffet lines during the first 2 days of the cruise. Also it is recommended that ill passengers seek medical care in the ship's medical center as soon as GI symptoms develop (see Fig. 40.1).17\n",

Alternative medicines may also help some individuals. Ondansetron (Zofran) is generally not as helpful. The association between passenger cabin location and risk of motion sickness is controversial, but a common perception persists that central cabins near the waterline are the least seasickness inducing. Passengers who can readily lie down can reduce their risk for motion sickness irrespective of their cabin location. Additionally, elderly passengers should be cautioned about the overuse of even over-the-counter medications that may affect balance, mental status, or urinary function.",
