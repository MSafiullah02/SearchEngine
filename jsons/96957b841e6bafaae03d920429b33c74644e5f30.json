Lan et al 1 reported that the health care workers who wore medical devices for more than 6 hours showed higher risks of skin damage, with desquamation in more than 60% of cases, and other signs, such as erythema, maceration, and ulcers, in a smaller percentage of cases. This skin damage may cause itching and pain 1 and further impair the quality of life among health care workers.",

The use of topical products containing purified omental lipids will help in improving skin barrier function, repairing the epithelial cell membrane, and increasing microcirculation. 4 These products are also useful to prevent the development of pressure injuries and may be used after removing the medical devices as well the nonadherent dressings (soft silicone/paraffin).",
