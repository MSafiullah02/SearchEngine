We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications.",

Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations.",

However, the main advantage of using RT-PCR assay is linked to its intrinsic high diagnostic accuracy, as previously demonstrated for influenza A, with high specificity and low sensitivity (7).

However, according to the official diagnosis and treatment protocol by the National Health Commission of China (16), CT examination represents a useful tool not only in diagnosing but also in monitoring progression and therapeutic efficacy. To support this, Miao et al (17) demonstrated that the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, allowing to alert clinicians for prompt treatment and repeat the RT-PCR test until the end of the incubation. Zhao et al (18) , by evaluating a cohort of 101 patients, established that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia showed typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases. Moreover, according to Fang et al (19) , the sensitivity of chest CT was statistically greater than RT-PCR (98% vs 71%), encouraging the use of CT as a screening test in patients with clinical and epidemiological features compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RT-PCR test can show a low efficiency probably due to the low viremia and the unsuitable clinical sampling. On these bases, as suggested by our results, CT plays an important role both in diagnosis, especially the differential, and in clinically suspected patients with negative chest radiograph due to its intrinsic higher sensitivity. Finally, even if different studies evaluated the role of CT as a routine imaging modality for diagnosis or screening, the use of CT is rather complex, especially in the Emergency Department, first of all, due to time-consuming decontamination procedures to be completed in the CT room among different patients (10) .",
