Such claims have bolstered the position of health on the global development agenda. To date, however, a relationship between population health and FDI has not been established in the empirical literature. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether population health encourages inflows of FDI after controlling for other relevant variables. This study is important for two main reasons. First, developing countries continue to face severe resource constraints. Placing budgetary priority on health interventions at the expense of competing claims merits a strong evidence-based foundation. Second, the expanding role of FDI in the global economy has made understanding its determinants a priority for both researchers and policy makers.",

A growing body of evidence has shown that health is an integral component of human capital that raises worker productivity and spurs economic growth. High levels of human capital in the workforce are likely, other things being equal, to make a country more attractive to foreign investors. On the other hand, high rates of absenteeism or worker turnover due to morbidity and mortality can raise production costs and deter FDI. A large burden of infectious diseases might also dampen FDI inflows to a given locale if investors fear for their own health or that of their staff.",

Our estimates suggest that raising life expectancy by one year increases FDI inflows by 9% in these countries, after controlling for other relevant factors. These findings are consistent with the view that health is an integral component of human capital for developing countries.",

During the past two decades, global inflows of FDI have soared: from $59 billion in 1982 to $651 billion in 2002 (UNCTAD, 2003). Attracting FDI is important for countries at all stages of development. It has been argued, however, that inducing greater FDI inflows is of more importance to developing countries given their lower savings rates and income levels. Indeed, FDI now represents the largest component of net resource flows to developing countries, surpassing official development assistance (ODA), portfolio investments, and bank loans (Miyamoto, 2003).",

These potential benefits of FDI have been widely publicized.

Industrialized economies are the most likely destination for FDI; and some developing countries receive much greater inflows than others.\n2 African countries in particular have struggled to attract foreign investors (see Morisset, 2002). In 2002, Africa attracted only $11 billion in foreign investment; far less than Central Europe ($28.7 billion), Latin America ($56 billion), or Asia ($95.1 billion) (UNCTAD, 2003). Asiedu (2002), empirically investigating the determinants of FDI to developing countries, found that sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries were less likely to attract investors than non-SSA countries, despite the fact that US investment into SSA had a higher rate of return than investment in other developing regions. Furthermore, factors proven to promote FDI to non-SSA countries (such as infrastructure and return on capital investment) did not have a clear impact on FDI to SSA countries. A survey conducted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) of the leading multinational enterprises supported Asiedu\u2019s results. Only one out of every five respondents expected higher inflows to African countries over the next two years, and two-thirds believed that the current level of flows would remain unchanged (UNCTAD, 2004b).",

            "text": "Under standard neoclassical assumptions (where output is produced by capital and labor), capital is predicted to flow from wealthy to poor countries until capital\u2013labor ratios equalize across countries. The observed pattern of FDI, with most capital flowing from one wealthy country to another, is thus an apparent paradox. Lucas (1990) argues that differences in human capital could explain this paradoxical pattern. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the idea that human capital might play a role in encouraging foreign investment. To the extent that physical capital and skills are complementary inputs, the presence of a healthy and more highly educated workforce can increase the productivity of capital. This is driven in part by economic activity shifting first from the primary goods to manufacturing sectors and then toward services, which are successively more knowledge intensive. For example, in the early 1970s, the services sector accounted for only 25% of the world FDI stock. By 2002, services had risen to about 60% of the total stock (UNCTAD, 2004a). FDI geared to knowledge- and skill-intensive industries may imply that countries with higher levels of human capital are more attractive to investors (Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko, 2003, Miyamoto, 2003, Noorbakhsh et al., 2001). Most cross-country studies investigating this idea identify human capital narrowly with education, ignoring strong reasons for considering health as an integral component of human capital. Therefore, in a natural extension of the literature, we investigate whether the health status of the population encourages inflows of FDI. In Section 3, we review empirical evidence establishing health as a form of human capital and summarize circumstantial evidence suggesting a link between health and FDI.",

Healthier children have enhanced cognitive function and higher school attendance, allowing them to become better educated, higher earning adults (Bhargava, 2001, Bloom, 2005). Healthier workers, who have lower rates of absenteeism and longer life expectancies, acquire more job experience. Better health also improves the prospective lifespan of workers. In countries with low life expectancies, the prospect of retiring is remote. Once better health becomes more common, retirement seems more attainable. Increased longevity, therefore, can generate the need for retirement income and set off a savings and investment boom (Bloom, Canning, & Graham, 2003). Health improvements may also affect the age structure of populations. Initially, such improvements tend to reduce mortality rates among infants and children, since interventions to reduce childhood mortality are usually neither costly nor complex. As parents come to expect more of their children to survive to adulthood, fertility rates fall. This change produces a baby boom generation. The fall in birth rates, coming as it does after a fall in mortality rates, means that the large baby boom generation is unique, with much smaller cohorts before and after it. As this generation enters the workforce, it may provide a boost to productivity leading to economic growth (Bloom & Canning, 2000).",

Companies operating in countries where health infrastructure and personnel are lacking may need to develop or significantly subsidize a health care system for their employees.\n3 Sick leave, funeral costs, and low workforce morale represent additional burdens for investing firms. In addition, for fear of endangering their own health and that of their expatriate staff, foreign investors may shun areas where disease is rampant and where access to health care is limited. Foreign investors and their managerial staff may lack resistance to disease, either acquired or inherited, that the host country population enjoys. For example, a significant portion of the population in Africa carries the sickle cell trait. This condition confers protection from severe malaria and is much less common among European descendants (Pasvol, Weatherall, & Wilson, 1978). A similar reduction in disease severity has been observed with certain types of thalassemia (Clegg & Weatherall, 1999). Indeed, these inherited hemoglobinopathies are thought to persist among certain African and Asian populations because natural selection favors alleles offering protection against malarial illness.",

Thus, we include a dummy variable for whether a country is landlocked with the stipulation that the country is not located in Western or Central Europe (countries in Western and Central Europe have close proximity to a major market and the absence of sea routes may not matter).

For example, parts of Southern Africa demonstrate a distinctive disease epidemiology partly due to shared ecological and historical characteristics (Bloom & Sachs, 1998).

Of particular relevance to the current study, we noted a gap in average life expectancy between income groups: 75.2 years for high-income countries versus 59.4 years for low- and middle-income countries. Diminishing returns to health might well make it a more important investment in low-income countries. We therefore analyze the model using two restricted samples, one of low- and middle-income countries and one of high-income countries selected on the basis of the World Bank\u2019s income classification.\n13\n",

Life expectancy once again has a positive and statistically significant effect on FDI. The large decrease in the coefficient on GDP per capita when we add life expectancy to the model indicates that when health is excluded from the model, GDP per capita is, to some extent, serving as a proxy for health in low- and middle-income countries.",

Reduced corruption does appear to have a positive and significant impact on FDI in this sample; indicating that the type of corruption, or the way it affects the economy, may differ between industrial and developing countries.

For example, taking regression 1, the F-test (distributed as a \u03c7\n2(7, 121)) yields a statistic of 2.18. This leads us to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients reported in the two sub-samples are the same at the 5% significance level.

It may be that certain diseases have a greater impact on FDI inflows than others. For example, diseases that afflict the working-age population (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or are easily transmittable (e.g., tuberculosis) may deter FDI inflows more than chronic, non-communicable diseases. Perhaps diseases with a high morbidity affect FDI differently than those with a high mortality.
