            "text": "In the wake of the influenza pandemic of 1889-1890 Jacques Bertillon, a pioneer of medical statistics, noticed that after the massive death spike there was a dip in birth numbers around 9 months later which was significantly larger than that which could be explained by the population change as a result of excess deaths. In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that behind the random appearance of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact hidden explanatory factors.",

In this respect one can observe that by saying that a phenomenon is random one gives up ipso facto all attempts to understand it. It is probably for this kind of reason that Albert Einstein supported the \"hidden variable\" interpretation of quantum physics. In 1935, i.e. some 10 years after quantum mechanics was introduced, Einstein (1935) suggested that the wave function description of quantum objects was incomplete in the sense that it did not include some hidden parameters.",

On the contrary, birth reductions after earthquakes can hardly by accounted for by biological factors. For that reason Fig. 2a Representation of the Bertillon coupling effect in the form of an input/output system. If one interprets the death spike as an impulse function, the birth trough can be seen as the impulse response of the system. An important point is that, as explained in the text, the loss of lives during the death spike cannot by itself account for the observed birth trough.

In order to generate the observed birth dips the size of this group must be several times larger than the number of fatalities. Fig. 2b The impact of a shock ranges from fatalities to minor afflictions. The figure was drawn for the case of an influenza outbreak but the same argument applies also to other kinds of shocks. Thus, for an earthquake some persons are killed, others only injured and still others are unharmed but have their house destroyed. This is illustrated in Fig.2b . In Sweden although there were only 43,000 excess deaths in 1918, it is estimated that about one third of the population, that is to say almost 2 millions (50 times more than those who died), was affected by the disease.

In Fig. 3b the birth curve was shifted 8 months to the left and turned upside down (by turning to negative numbers). As a result this new series represents the conceptions (at this point we do not know why the time lag is rather 8 months instead of 9 months). The Bertillon birth effect is clearly visible in the fact that the maximum of the deaths coincides with a minimum of the conceptions. In Fig. 3b the correlation of the two series is 0.76.

Moreover, because the price of a put option increases when the price of the stock declines, speculators can make a profit by selling their put options.

For the present study we rather need the time D between the sexual intercourse which led to the conception and birth. The conception results from the encounter between a spermatozoon and an ovum (also called ovule or egg cell). Ovulation means that the egg is released from the ovary into the Fallopian tube; it remains there in good shape for only one day which means that conception and ovulation must take place almost on the same day. In contrast the spermatozoa can stay alive in the Fallopian tube for 3 days with similar conception probabilities during those 3 days 8 . Once fertilized the egg starts its journey down the Fallopian tube and into the uterus where it will get implanted. The familiar estimate of 9 (mean) months corresponds to an interval of 274 days, that is to say one week longer than the (more accurate) estimate given in the figure. The standard 280 day figure refers to the time interval between the last menstrual period and birth; it overestimates the time between sexual intercourse and birth by two weeks. The 9 day dispersion of ovulation refers to its standard deviation. Sources: Wilcox et al. (1995 Wilcox et al. ( ,2000 , Bhat et al. (2006) The key-question then is: when does ovulation occur? It is often said that it occurs at day 14 in the menstrual cycle. In fact, this depends upon the length of the menstrual cycle (Wilcox et al. 2000) . When the length of the cycle is 28 days, ovulation occurs on average at day 12. When the cycle lasts more than 30 days, the ovulation takes place on day 14. The global average for all cycles is 14 days. Coupled with the standard estimate of 280 days starting from the beginning of the cycle one gets: 280-14=266 days following ovulation. With respect to intercourse one gets time intervals of D = 266, 267, 268 days with same probability for each duration, which gives an average of D = 267. The distribution of the fertility window is approximately Gaussian 9 with a standard deviation of 9 days. In summary: D = 267 \u00b1 \u03c3, \u03c3 = 9 days This estimate is confirmed by the following result based on a sample of 125 pregnancies in which \"the median time from ovulation to birth was 268 days\" (Jukic et al. 2013) .",

Actually this death surge remains somewhat mysterious in the sense that its cause remains unknown. It was not an influenza epidemic because there are no excess deaths whatsoever in neighboring countries such as Argentina or Uruguay. The fact that the mortality extends over 2 months excludes an earthquake and indeed no earthquake was recorded in July-August (though there was one on 4 May 1923). Despite of this uncertainty the birth trough is indeed present where expected. The mortality surge of July-August 1923 was due to a yet unknown factor. Nonetheless it resulted in the expected birth trough. It is the association trough-rebound which allows us to distinguish the troughs due to a death surge from the seasonal troughs which also occur in mid-year but have no associated rebound.
