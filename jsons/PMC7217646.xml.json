These included the development of receptor-specific immunomodulatory peptides that use a novel, ligand-independent mechanism of action (the so-called \u2018SCHOOL peptides\u2019). Ligand-independent modulation is especially important for those receptors the ligands of which are still unknown (e.g., TREM-1). For this reason, the main focus is on ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides and their use in multiple cell and animal model systems.",

Nevertheless, researchers considered the observed homooligomerization of the cytoplasmic domains of MIRR signaling subunits [7] as a missing piece of the longstanding puzzle of MIRR triggering and developed a novel, all-inclusive platform of MIRR triggering, the SCHOOL model [9]. The main SCHOOL concept is that the similar structural architecture of MIRRs (Fig. 1) dictates similar molecular mechanisms of their triggering.",

            "text": "Peptides capable of inhibiting TCR-mediated cell activation in a ligand-independent manner have been known since 1997 [17] (Table 1\n). However, despite extensive studies (reviewed in [1]), the mechanism of their action remained enigmatic until the SCHOOL model was first introduced and applied to this field in 2004 [9]. Since then, the SCHOOL mechanism remains the only one that is consistent with all data reported so far for these peptides (reviewed in [1]). For example, no other model of TCR triggering can explain why the peptide GLRILLLKV derived from the TCR-\u03b1 TMD (Table 1) inhibits antigen- but not antibody-mediated T cell activation [18] (see [1] for more details). Another striking example is that the SCHOOL model is the only one that explains mechanistically why the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo T cell inhibition results observed for the peptides derived from the TMDs of CD3\u03b5, CD3\u03b4, or CD3\u03b3 signaling subunits ([19], Table 1) is not a \u2018discrepancy\u2019 (see [1] for more details). Collectively, these and other numerous examples (reviewed in [1]) suggest that rationally designed SCHOOL peptides can be successfully used to study multiple aspects of MIRR-mediated cell activation. This is especially important for the studies of those MIRRs that signal through more than one signaling subunit (e.g., TCR and B cell receptor, BCR) because it provides means for modulating specific signals and, as a result, specific cell responses.",

The peptides derived from the CD3\u03b1, CD3\u03b4, or CD3\u03b3 TMDs effectively inhibit an immune response and reduce signs of inflammation in the adjuvant arthritis rat model [19].

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock are life-threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2 and common causes of death related to COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICU) [32]. Although most experimental COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines currently aim to block the spread of the viral infection and treat early stages of the disease, therapeutics that slow down the progression from pneumonia to sepsis and ARDS in patients with COVID-19 could reduce the mortality rate in infected risk groups. In patients with cancer, who occupy up to 15% of all ICU beds, the incidence of ARDS is 11.9% of patients with cancer in the ICU, and 17.8% among those on mechanical ventilation [33]. Mortality caused by ARDS in patients with cancer is greater than that of other ICU populations [34]. In experimental ARDS, TREM-1 blockade has been shown to significantly reduce the lung inflammatory response and extend survival [35], highlighting the potential of TREM-1 as an emerging target for neutrophilic lung inflammation and ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and/or cancer.",

The data generated in two NSCLC xenograft models in nude mice demonstrated for the first time a therapeutic efficacy of ligand-independent inhibition of TREM-1 in the treatment of cancer.

Successful use of GF9 therapy in experimental pancreatic cancer [48] further confirmed the pan-cancer nature of the TREM-1 target. All TREM-1 SCHOOL inhibitory formulations used in this study strongly suppressed the tumor growth and extended animal survival in several xenograft models [48]. The long-lasting antitumor response to GF9 therapy persisted after treatment and correlated significantly with reduced TAM infiltration [48]. As anticipated, the noncytotoxic TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides were well tolerated during long-term administration when deployed either in free form or formulated into macrophage-targeted LPC for peptide half-life extension and targeted delivery. The study revealed for the first time that, in mice with cancer, TREM-1 blockade using TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides significantly reduced serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1), but not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a possible contribution of CSF-1-dependent antitumor mechanisms to the observed therapeutic activity [48]. Furthermore, in xenograft models, GF9 therapy standalone was as effective as a first-line standard chemotreatment (gemcitabine + nanoparticle albumin-bound PTX, Abraxane; GEM + ABX), whereas, in combination with GEM + ABX, it synergistically suppressed pancreatic tumor growth and increased survival more than threefold over chemotherapy alone (Alexander Sigalov, unpublished observations, XXXX). Future studies need to elucidate whether TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides synergize with standard cancer immunotherapy (e.g., anti PD-1/PD-L1), which is largely ineffective in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

This indicates that ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibition can be used in the prevention and treatment of retinal neovascular diseases. The study also demonstrated the ability of the TREM-1 inhibitory formulations used to not only cross the BBB, but also to penetrate the blood\u2013retina barrier (BRB). Importantly, TREM-1 blockade using GF9 therapy substantially downregulated retinal levels of TREM-1 and CSF-1 but not VEGF [43], suggesting that the mechanisms of TREM-1-dependent suppression of pathological but not physiological angiogenesis involve CSF-1. Thus, GF9 therapy can represent a safe and effective alternative to the current VEGF-targeted therapy that is complicated by damage of healthy vessels, potential adverse effects on neurons, rapid vascular regrowth upon interrupting VEGF blockade, and limited effectiveness in some patients.",
