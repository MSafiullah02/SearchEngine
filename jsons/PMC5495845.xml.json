The burden of invasive GAS infections in western countries is significant with an average incidence of 2.45 cases per 100,000 person-year and a case fatality rate of 15% [2].

Nowadays, the emm gene, encoding for the M protein, allows the typing of isolates using PCR and sequencing of the amplicons, but not to discriminate between two isolates of the same emm-type and subtype. The same limitation applies to other typing approaches such as (i) multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on the amplification and sequencing of a few housekeeping genes [6] or (ii) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of large genomic fragments, previously cut by restriction enzymes [7]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has recently entered diagnostic laboratories and becomes a very powerful tool that allows differentiation between isolates at the level of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) as well as a thorough investigation of the presence of specific virulence and antibiotic resistance genes [8]. Furthermore, mutations in two-components systems, in transcriptional regulators or in regulatory proteins (e.g. covR/covS (csrR/csrS), ropB/rgg or rocA respectively) have been shown to increase GAS virulence [9, 10], and the presence of such mutations may be investigated in order to get insights into the isolate\u2019s propensity for invasion.",

RocA positively regulates covR transcription and possibly directly phosphorylates CovR [10]. Mutations resulting in premature truncation of RocA were shown to increase hyaluronic acid production and virulence. Mutations in ropB, a negative transcriptional regulator of many virulence genes, have been linked to more invasive phenotypes [24]. This regulator is also necessary for the expression of speB, a gene encoding for a cysteine protease degrading many Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factors and whose expression is inversely proportional to virulence, though speB is also known to be a major virulence factor involved in tissue invasion and in the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis [9].
