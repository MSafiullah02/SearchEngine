            "text": "A fundamental step toward understanding information diffusion was the adoption of threshold and cascade models [24] [25] [26] applied to spreading in social networks. In this last context, an actor's diffusion behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaged in the process [5, 27, 28] . These works have recently been generalized to multilevel networks [29] [30] [31] [32] . The diffusion of information has also been modeled using game theory, giving players a positive payoff if they spread the information [8, 23, 33, 34] . Moreover, the topological factors that may affect the spreading have been investigated in detail in [27, 35, 36] . Other applications related to information diffusion, such as finding the influential spreaders [37] , maximizing or restraining the information propagation [38, 39] , predicting the information diffusion on real-world social networks [10, [40] [41] [42] , and revealing general patterns of the diffusion of the temporal information [43] , have also been studied extensively.",

However, certainly a person's decision on whether or not to transmit a given piece of information relies on many factors, one of them being trust in the sources [44] . In a network context, where spreading takes place using the topological structure, this trust is conceived at the level of individual nodes. In our approach, we consider that the decision whether to transmit a certain piece of information depends on the number of trustable and untrustable acquaintances involved in the process. For example, a person who receives a piece of information from a few untrustable neighbors may decide not to forward it because of the lack of reliable evidence, but the behavior changes if these neighbors are trustable. Within this scenario, an untrustable individual is one that you do not know if you can trust; other meanings could be assigned to untrustability, but this one is the more appropriate in our framework.",

Similar to [12, 49] , each dynamic takes place in a different layer of a multiplex network, thus taking into account the possibility of having different connections between individuals in the trust and information-spreading layers, respectively. Note that the interaction between both layers is limited to the following: each actor has a game dynamics that specifies the state of being trustable or not. This state is visible for the actors in the spreading phase that takes place on the second layer. In this sense, the trust in one layer influences the spreading on the other.",

A common model of choice for information spreading is the threshold model [26, 27] , in which an Inactive individual becomes Active whenever the fraction of its active neighbors is above a certain threshold \u03b8 . Thus, in order to take into account the trust in the neighbors, we have modified the threshold rule incorporating into it the number of trustable (T) and untrustable (U) neighbors, either active or inactive. For the trust evolution, we have chosen a Prisoner's Dilemma [48, 50, 51] evolutionary game dynamics, in which we assimilate persistent cooperators (defectors) as trustable (untrustable) individuals. We show a schematic representation of the system in Fig. 1 , where G and H represent the game (trust) and information-spreading layers, respectively. The connectivity between individuals is encoded in the corresponding adjacency matrices G ij and H ij , which take the value 1 if nodes i and j are connected, and 0 otherwise.",

However, since we suppose the trust is a long-term effect of the game dynamics, governed by the memory span t, we may use an adiabatic approximation in which, for each time step t of the trust dynamics, we calculate the extension \u03c1(t) of the information spreading as if it were instantaneous (using as input to the equations the current distribution of trustable and untrustable nodes). The final outcome is then \u03c1 = max t \u03c1(t), meaning that, during the trust evolution, there is a moment at which the information spreading extends the largest, and the rest of the TDIS dynamics is not able to increase it anymore. Unfortunately, we do not know in advance when this peak of spreading is going to happen, and simulations show that in many occasions it appears in the transitory of the trust evolution, thus forcing us to follow the whole trust dynamics to perform the prediction of the information spreading.",

However, when we start increasing the influence of trustable neighbors, the fraction of active nodes quickly rises, easily covering the whole population. This effect is more important for intermediate values of the temptation b and shorter memory time spans. Taking into account the results in Figs. 2 and 3, it becomes evident that the information spreading is not just a consequence of the fraction of trustable nodes in the stationary state of the trust dynamics, but it must also depend on its transitory states. For example, when b is close to 1, all nodes are trustable in the steady state (s (T ) = 1), which corresponds to a region in Fig. 2 where the activity cannot propagate, but it does. Therefore, the only possibility is that, during the transitory of the trust dynamics, the number of trustable nodes changes continuously from the initial fraction 50% to a final value (not necessarily in a monotonic way), and it is in these intermediate states when the information spreading achieves its maximum level. Moreover, the fact that the influence \u03b1 can be small for full spreading, unlike in Fig. 2 , points to the importance of the whole trust dynamics to explain the spreading, which cannot be understood by just accounting for the fraction of trustable individuals.",

Thus, the fraction of trustable nodes approaches a constant value that, in the limit t \u2192 \u221e, is equal to the stationary value in Fig. 3 . In this situation, we expect to have a level of spreading similar to those in Fig. 2 , hence explaining the important reduction in information spreading as memory rises.",

Three factors affecting this personal behavior are taken into account: the degree of influence of trustable acquaintances versus untrustable ones, the memory span to consider trustable individuals as such, and the temptation to not cooperate in the next action. The result is a Trust-Driven Information-Spreading model, on top of a two-layer multiplex network, in which individuals participate in two processes, a trust dynamics in one layer and an information spreading in the other. The influence and distribution of trustable actors affect the diffusion of information, while there is no interaction in the opposite direction, from the spreading to the trust layer. For the diffusion of the information, individuals become spreaders when the influence of their neighbors exceeds a certain threshold. We have shown that this model allows an analytical treatment of the information diffusion, based on a tree approximation, in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.",

However, the information is restrained when a long-term memory of previous behaviors is used to assign the trustable or untrustable character of individuals. Additionally, intermediate values of the temptation enhance the spreading thanks to the fact that they yield balanced populations of trustable and untrustable individuals, which is the most favorable configuration to satisfy the threshold condition and become a spreader. We have also shown that not only the fraction but also the distribution and evolution of trustable nodes are important to predict the final outcome of the spreading process, and that all the previous results apply both for random ER and heterogeneous scale-free BA multiplex networks. These results provide clues to understand and quantify the effects of a rational individual's decision making in the propagation of all kinds of information.",
