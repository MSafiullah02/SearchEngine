These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3] [4] [5] . NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6] , including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7] . Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9] . Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically na\u00efve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10] [11] [12] [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 330, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 331, "end": 333, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 688, "end": 691, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 696, "end": 699, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 777, "end": 780, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1238, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1241, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1244, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1552, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Factors that influence the clinical and epidemiologic importance of drug-resistant influenza viruses include the magnitude of phenotypic resistance, its frequency and rapidity of emergence, its stability and ability of resistant variants to compete with wild-type virus in the absence of selective drug pressure, and the effects of resistance mutations on viral replication competence, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in vivo. Prior to being replaced by the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus, most circulating seasonal A/H1N1 viruses in the 2008-2009 season contained the His275Tyr mutation and were therefore highly resistant to oseltamivir while retaining susceptibility to zanamivir. All currently circulating A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses have mutations conferring M2 inhibitor resistance. There is no data to date indicating that M2 inhibitor resistance is associated with worsened viral virulence, atypical influenza, or enhanced transmissibility. Sporadic viruses with primary resistance mutations resulting in neuraminidase inhibitor resistance have been described. Most but not all NA mutations conferring resistance in clinical isolates have been associated with reduced infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity in animal models of influenza. Such features are important not only in clinical management of individual patients but also are key factors that need to be considered by health authorities and governments when making decisions regarding the stockpiling of antivirals for response to pandemics or other influenza threats [14, 15] .

Development of resistance during the course of therapy was very common among initially M2 inhibitor-susceptible viruses in the past. Mutations in one of five amino acids in the M2 gene result in cross-resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine. Resistance emergence during therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors generally remains rare for circulating strains of A/ H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses, with higher rates in children and immunocompromised patients. A common feature of patients who develop resistance despite ongoing therapy is high-level replication and longer duration of replication in the presence of antiviral therapy. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors results from mutations in the neuraminidase gene, the hemagglutinin gene, or both. The specific mutation determines the degree of resistance and which neuraminidase inhibitor has reduced susceptibility. Further, the frequency and magnitude of NA inhibitor resistance vary with drug, virus, and neuraminidase type and subtype. Resistance has been demonstrated to develop during the course of therapy with avian viruses, particularly A/H7N9, with greater frequency than seasonal human viruses. Compensatory mutations may also occur that improve the fitness and transmissibility of resistant viruses and may play a role in establishing persistent transmission, as was demonstrated with the seasonal A/H1N1 during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Several new classes of antivirals, many with novel mechanisms of action, are currently undergoing development.

M2 inhibitors bind to the M2 ion channel and limit the influx of protons resulting in its antiviral effect. Since the M2 protein is present only on influenza A viruses, M2 inhibitors have no activity against influenza B [17] . There are currently two approved M2 ion channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine. Early studies demonstrated that influenza variants with high-level resistance to amantadine and rimantadine could be selected in the laboratory though in vitro and in vivo passage in virus in the presence of the drug [3, 18] . Studies of resistance helped to determine the mechanism of antiviral action of the M2 inhibitors [19] . Mutations in the M2 inhibitor gene at one of five commonly recognized sites (position 26, 27, 30, 31, or 34 of the M2 protein) in human viruses result in reduced binding of the M2 inhibitors or in enlargement of the pore diameter.

About 30 % of adults treated with M2 inhibitors will have resistant variants detected during the course of their illness with high frequency (up to 80 %) of resistance emergence in immunocompromised patients, patients hospitalized for influenza, and children [8, 23, 25, 27, 28] . Until recently, the frequency of M2 inhibitor resistance among seasonal isolated was low (1-3 %) [29] . Since 2002, though, the prevalence of resistance to M2 inhibitors among circulating influenza A/H3N2 increased globally, and now the majority of A/H3N2 globally is resistant to this class of drugs [29, 30] . Resistance has resulted from the S31N substitution of the M2 inhibitor. M2 inhibitor resistance has also been documented in several important novel strains of influenza: A/H5N1, A/H7N9, and 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Most clade 1 A/H5N1 viruses and all swine-origin A/H1N1 are resistant to the M2 inhibitors as a result of the S31N substitution, while most (~80 %) of clade 2.1 A/H5N1 are resistant secondary to S31N or V27A substitution [31, 32, 37] . Of note, most of the clade 2.2 and 2.3 A/H5N1 viruses remain susceptible to M2 inhibitors [37] .

In vitro studies to determine the genetic antiviral resistance profiles of the NA inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir were initiated shortly after their development (reviewed in [70, 71] . Due to differences in drug binding interactions and structural differences in the enzyme active site, NA inhibitors show varying antiviral resistance profiles in NA that depend on virus type and subtype (reviewed in [72] [73] [74] ). Sequential passage in cell culture to select resistant variants found that changes in HA could confer resistance in vitro also [75] [76] [77] . These HA changes are predominately found at the receptor binding site and thought to restore the functional balance between HA receptor-binding and NA receptor-destroying properties [78] . Mechanisms which influence the viral HA/NA functional balance may have played a role in the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 viruses during the 2007-2008 season [79] [80] [81] [82] . The frequency and possible importance of resistance emergence during drug administration have been studied largely in the context of controlled clinical trials conducted in the late 1990s that served as the basis for approval of zanamivir and oseltamivir in 1999 and, more recently, for approval of laninamivir and peramivir [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . Although zanamivir and oseltamivir have been available in many countries since 1999, their use has been quite limited, except in Japan and during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic [88] . Clinical importance of antiviral resistance emergence was assessed when comparing clinical outcome of oseltamivir-treated patients infected with a susceptible or oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus during the 2007-2008 influenza season [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] . A retrospective clinical study by Dharan et al. showed that patients infected with an oseltamivir-susceptible virus (n = 182) had significantly fewer days of fever if treated with oseltamivir (n = 64) as compared to non-treated patients (n = 93;P = 0.02). In contrast, patients infected with an oseltamivir-resistant viruses (n = 44) did not benefit from oseltamivir treatment (n = 43; P = 0.5) [91] .

This oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus variant with an NA H275Y amino acid change emerged first in Norway during the 2007-2008 season and was able to spread rapidly in humans [94, 95] . As it became the dominant variant, it was suggested that the oseltamivir-resistant virus was able to spread more easily in the population than wild type [79, 96] .

Humanized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines that stably overexpress human 2,6-sialyltransferase (SIAT1) to increase alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids may overcome this first limitation.

Two studies in Japanese children reported high frequencies of 16 and 18 % oseltamivir resistance emergence during oseltamivir therapy [8, 147] . The use of weight-based dosing for children in Japan, as contrasted with unit dosing in most countries, is associated with lower drug exposure in young children. This has been postulated to be a major factor in the higher frequency of resistance detected in these studies. Among 54 volunteers experimentally infected with an A/H1N1 virus, oseltamivirresistant variants with His274Tyr mutation were detected in two subjects in association with apparent rebounds in viral replication [148] . This study found that oseltamivir-treated subjects were less likely than placebo to have late viral isolates showing reversion of the egg-adapted inoculum virus to a human receptor HA genotype. The His274Tyr finding suggests that HA mutations with reduced affinity for human receptors might have a replication advantage over viruses with human receptor preference during oseltamivir use in humans. Interestingly, amino acid changes in the HA of the influenza A/H1N1 viruses prior to the emergence of the oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus in the 2007-2008 season have been predicted to have facilitated the emergence of the His274Tyr amino acid change [149, 150] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 453, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 943, "end": 948, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1608, "text": "[149,", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1613, "text": "150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunocompetent Hosts"}, {"text": "Immunocompromised individuals tend to suffer from influenza longer with more serious complications than otherwise healthy patients [151] [152] [153] [154] .

Several recent clinical studies have reported that the emergence of antiviral resistance among treated immunocompromised patients is not uncommon [151, 157, 158] .

Based on animal experiments, the reduced fitness and replication competence of certain NA resistance mutations appeared to be depending on virus subtype and resistance mutation. For instance, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H3N2 virus with an Arg292Lysine amino acid change did not transmit between infected and na\u00efve ferrets and showed a 10-100fold reduction in nasal virus titers [165] .

An influenza A/H1N1 virus with a His275YTyr mutation required 100-fold higher inoculum to infect the donor ferret, but once infected, they transmitted the virus to contact animals with a delay of 1-3 days compared to wild-type virus.

Further studies of such ribavirin-NA inhibitor or T-705-NA inhibitor combinations (see below) are warranted to determine whether this strategy offers the possibility of treating severe influenza, particularly that due to M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses. Recently, triple combinations of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir have been studied in vitro, in vivo, and in humans with influenza infection [65, 66, 190] . Given the promise of this combination, a prospective phase 2 study is ongoing to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combination for the treatment of influenza. Combination therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the development of resistance in clinical studies and therefore may be of benefit in populations at increased risk of development of resistance emergences [54] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 303, "text": "[188]", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 512, "end": 517, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 732, "end": 737, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1145, "text": "[65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1149, "text": "66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1154, "text": "190]", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1541, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment Alternatives"}, {"text": "Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) is an antiviral drug that is phosphoribosylated by cellular enzymes to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-triphosphate (RTP), and selectively inhibits the RNAdependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus [191] .

Further, resistance in seasonal A/H1N1 became widespread during the 2008-2009 influenza season. Lastly, NA inhibitor resistance has been demonstrated to emerge during therapy in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that infect humans, with the highest frequency in A/H7N9 viruses [35, 36, 49] . As such, most regions of the world are currently limited to a single class of drug, the neuraminidase inhibitor, for the management of influenza infections. The risk that resistance could emerge and result in global spread poses a serious threat and requires the development of novel agents and combinations [128, 187] .

Further, the clinical and epidemiologic implications of antiviral resistance in a future pandemic influenza virus cannot be predicted with confidence.

Specific risk factors beyond generic concepts, such as immunocompromised and young age, should be identified that predict the emergence of resistance. From a therapeutic perspective, the optimal approach, including the duration of therapy and the benefit of combination therapy in patients with severe illness or who are predicted to have prolonged shedding, needs to be carefully studied. Currently, there is a significant gap in the capacity to test specimens for resistance, and as a result, many patients with potential resistance may be missed. As a result, there is a desperate need for susceptibility assays that can be utilized broadly in the clinical laboratory.
