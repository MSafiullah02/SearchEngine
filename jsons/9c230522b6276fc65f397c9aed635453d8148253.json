Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 following several small clinical trials, uncontrolled case series, and public figure endorsements. While there is a growing body of scientific data, there is also concern for harm, particularly QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we perform a rapid narrative review and discuss the strengths and limitations of existing in vitro and clinical studies. We call for additional randomized controlled trial evidence prior to the widespread incorporation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into national and international treatment guidelines.",

Accounts of limited personal protective equipment, lack of critical care resources such as ventilators, and healthcare worker shortages have become unfortunate daily realities as researchers scramble to identify strategies to both interrupt transmission and treat the disease. To date, there are more than 300 ongoing clinical research trials investigating potential therapeutic options for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 [2] .",

Hydroxychloroquine was later introduced in 1955 and quickly became favored due to its superior safety profile [4] . The mechanism of action of these drugs against Plasmodium parasites is believed to be partly related to its interaction with DNA and through inhibition of the polymerization of heme [6, 7] . The immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine is related to a broad spectrum of immunoregulation networks discussed extensively in other work [5, 8, 9] . In addition to activity against rheumatic diseases, the two antimalarial agents have also shown therapeutic activity or immune modulatory effects in a wide range of other diseases including antiphospholipid syndrome, amebiasis, HIV/AIDS, and some cancers [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Based on studies initially performed on SARS-CoV, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, and that chloroquine may prevent the virus from binding to this receptor by inhibiting terminal glycosylation [30] . New research has proposed that hydroxychloroquine may additionally prevent SARS-CoV-2 from binding with gangliosides, which in turn may inhibit virion contact with the ACE-2 receptor [33] . Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine additionally can incorporate into endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in an increased pH of intracellular compartments. These organelles normally require an acidic environment for homeostasis. Ultimately, this increase in pH results in their dysfunction, leading to defective protein degradation, endocytosis, and exocytosis needed for viral infection, replication, and propagation [34] . Prior work has also demonstrated that coronaviruses can use proteins on the surface of endosomes and endolysosomes for viral entry into host cells [35] . Entry into the endolysosome may be necessary for the viral genome to be released into the cytoplasm of infected host cells [36] . However, it remains unclear how changes in the endosomal environment, particularly changes in pH, may affect the integrity of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. Overall, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine are capable of affecting several cellular pathways and therefore may have several mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. Table 1 ",

In early March, Chen et al. published the results of the first hydroxychloroquine study in patients with COVID-19 [43] . In this small, 30-person inpatient, randomized controlled trial comparing hydroxychloroquine to the standard of care, researchers found no statistically significant differences in time to viral clearance by day seven between those who received hydroxychloroquine (87% clearance) versus those who did not (93%, P > .05). They also did not identify any difference in clinical outcomes (i.e., duration of fever, changes in lung imaging). While they did not comment on the severity of illness of those enrolled, those in the hydroxychloroquine and control arms had symptoms for approximately seven and six days respectively. At two weeks, all patients had negative viral nucleic acid tests. On March 16, 2020, Gao et al., extracted data from 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from ongoing inpatient studies in China and reported patient improvement with the use of chloroquine [48] . The authors claimed that chloroquine was superior to standard of care treatment in helping reduce time to clinical recovery and improving lung imaging findings; however, no data supporting these findings were published, and no clinical information, including the severity of illness and outcomes, nor statistical analyses were presented in this brief report [48] .",

Twenty-six hospitalized patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (600 mg for ten days), six of whom received azithromycin (500 mg, followed by 250 mg for a total of five days). Sixteen patients who did not meet study inclusion criteria served as study controls. At the time of enrollment, nearly 17% of all patients were asymptomatic, 61% had upper respiratory symptoms, and 22% had pneumonia or bronchitis-like symptoms. In unadjusted analyses, the authors found significantly reduced viral titers in those who received hydroxychloroquine at day six compared to those who did not (70% vs. 12.5%, P < .001); however, six participants in the hydroxychloroquine treatment arm (23%) were excluded from analysis as they required intensive care admission, died, withdrew from the study, or were lost to follow-up.

Of the six patients who received azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine, all patients had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test by day 6 without comparison to adequate controls. Gautret et al. also recently released results of another open-label unblinded study, assessing the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 80 hospitalized patients using the same dosing regimen as previously described [44, 47] . Six patients included in this analysis were included in the original study. Nearly 58% of these patients had at least one underlying chronic health condition. Four patients were asymptomatic at baseline, whereas 41% had upper respiratory tract symptoms, and 54% had pneumonia or bronchitis-like symptoms. Approximately 92% of patients had a low national early warning score, indicating that the overall severity of illness in this population was mild. They reported 83% of patients having undetectable nasopharyngeal viral loads on day seven; however, there was no comparison group and thus, the results are nearly impossible to interpret.

No placebo was utilized in this study. Standard of care was defined as oxygen, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin, with or without corticosteroids. Only patients with chest CT confirmed pneumonia and mild illness with SaO2/SpO2 >93% or PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg were allowed to enroll. While the researchers found a more substantial proportion of those receiving hydroxychloroquine had clinical improvement of pneumonia (80% vs. 55%, P < .04) as determined by day zero to day six chest CT, the methodology was not described. Outcomes were likely based on subjective individual clinician opinion, which may not have been blinded to the treatment allocation. Decreased duration of cough (2.0 vs. 3.1 days, P < .001), and shortened time to clinical recovery were also reported for those receiving hydroxychloroquine when compared to the controls; however, only 48% (15/31) of those randomized to hydroxychloroquine and 71% (22/31) of controls had cough at baseline and it is unknown for what duration. Four patients in the control group were said to have progressed to severe illness, though severe illness was not defined. No underlying patient comorbidities were examined, and this may have been an overall confounding variable. Additionally, the specific antiviral and antibacterial medications utilized as a part of standard of care treatment were unspecified and may have affected the results. Overall, similar to prior studies, serious limitations exist, and the results of this non-peer reviewed study should be interpreted with appropriate caution.",

Four of the five hydroxychloroquine studies shared the same dosing regimen (400 mg hydroxychloroquine for five days); but based on in vitro data, doses as high as 800 mg, if not higher, followed by 400 mg for several days, may be required for effective viral clearance in humans [39] . Only one of the six studies was officially peer-reviewed, though concerns have been raised about this article [49] . These studies should, therefore, be interpreted as solely hypothesis-generating and should not serve as supporting evidence for the widespread inclusion of hydroxychloroquine/ chloroquine in clinical guidelines. Given that all of these studies reported differences in the disease severity, the overall patient populations may not be comparable. Moving forward, researchers should report the severity of COVID-19 illness based on symptom duration as well as using a systematic, severity scale.",

A subsequent surge in prescriptions has caused widespread shortages of hydroxychloroquine, which has threatened the supply of this medication for patients with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The incorporation of these medications into national treatment guidelines has several consequences. While hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are seemingly safe medications, they are not benign and there are important side effects. Although side effects are not common with these medicines, rare adverse effects of a medication that is prescribed commonly without a rigorous evidence base can be dangerous on a population level. Bluntly stated, any significant side effect is not justifiable if the drug is not effective. Given these potentially deleterious consequences of widespread use of these drugs in the absence of robust data, the European Medicines Agency has refused to approve chloroquine for COVID-19 and has restricted its use to solely clinical trials or through national emergency use programs [52] .",

Presently over 1 million cases of COVID-19 have been identified. If all patients had received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, even if, for example, QTc prolongation and arrhythmia are seen in less than 0.1% of the population, this would equate to 1000 adverse events, which is arguably not acceptable if the medication is not effective. Of note, Gautret and Molina examined the treatment of COVID-19 with combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which many clinicians have now started to prescribe together, without evidence, in the outpatient setting. In these studies, this combination was utilized in an inpatient environment, presumably with some degree of cardiac monitoring. Both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, alone, but especially in combination, can increase the risk of QTc prolongation, and lead to malignant arrhythmias [4, 6] . In a retrospective population study of 60 000 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic disease, researchers found an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality when hydroxychloroquine was used in combination with azithromycin (50 deaths) when compared to hydroxychloroquine and amoxicillin (25 deaths) (Hazard Ratio: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.22-3.94); however, all-cause mortality was the same (Hazard Ratio 1.34) [53] . This risk can be significantly increased when considering other commonly prescribed medications with the potential for QTc prolongation like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, and various antimicrobials. These small studies demonstrate insufficient evidence to therefore support the routine use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin outside of a clinical trial with adequate cardiac monitoring.",

A recent openlabel randomized trial of 14 days of lopinavir/ritonavir therapy among severely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 showed no clinical improvement and no reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load beyond standard care [54] . Despite these negative results, lopinavir/ritonavir is still commonly used to treat COVID in some settings, often concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Importantly, lopinavir/ritonavir can potentially increase chloroquine plasma levels by inhibition of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism, therefore increasing the risk for malignant arrhythmias. Moreover, other factors such as myocarditis and myocardial ischemia, reported in the context of COVID-19 [55] , or hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, often seen in the acute phase of severe COVID-19, can further contribute to the development of acute arrhythmias [56] . Thus, this calls for prudent and well-informed use of lopinavir/ritonavir and QTc-prolonging medications, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, to treat COVID-19.",
