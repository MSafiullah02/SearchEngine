Although a variety of antiviral agents along with steroids were used during the outbreak in 2003, there has not been any proper clinical trial to formally evaluate the various forms of treatment.14 For more severely affected adolescents, treatment was largely based on the adult experience. Since SARS was shortly found to be caused by a coronavirus, ribavirin was widely used in treating adult cases in Hong Kong. Autopsy findings in fatal adult cases revealed diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates.4 This led to the suggestion that an exaggerated immune response might be the possible pathophysiological process leading to the severe damage of the lungs and other organs.",

As a result, both adults and severely affected adolescents were treated with steroids and ribavirin. However, subsequent experimental data revealed that ribavirin was most likely ineffective against SARS-associated coronavirus.18 The use of corticosteroids with this possibly ineffective antiviral agent in patients with coronavirus pneumonia can be detrimental. In fact, many adult patients eventually died of other nosocomial infections,19 and such infections might be related to the excessive immunosuppression associated with the use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, 15% of adult patients in one series developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and 6% had bilateral involvement.19 It is important to note that steroids and ribavirin were not used in many other centres during the outbreak in 2003, and the mortality rates of their patients were similar to or better than that of patients treated with such a combination.20, 21\n",

The world has learnt many important lessons in the control of the SARS outbreak. Unlike SARS, the transmission of avian influenza between humans is relatively inefficient. It is highly likely that further mutation of the avian strain will result in more efficient transmission. The control of trading and the human consumption of wild animals appear to be important in preventing the re-emergence of SARS.
