            "text": "Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that rely on the host machinery to mediate viral protein synthesis and to replicate their genomes. Because viral genomes are compact, they do not encode the necessary components of the translational machinery and thus, the virus must usurp the available cellular resources and divert them toward viral translation. However, the virus must contend with cellular transcripts that are being translated through the canonical translation initiation pathway, and evade host innate immune responses that act to restrict viral spread by inhibiting virus translation and replication. As such, viruses have evolved various noncanonical mechanisms that confer the ability to preferentially engage the host ribosome during infection and to counter antiviral mechanisms. In this review, there will be an emphasis on viral strategies to hijack the canonical translation pathway, modulation of host factors and the use of alternate translation initiation factors, and viral recoding mechanisms. The examples of viral translation strategies presented herein are not all\u2010encompassing, but rather, they are illustrative of novel strategies that have emerged in recent literature, with references to classical examples of which the mechanisms have been well characterized. Comprehensive reviews on these translational mechanisms have been described.1, 2 These strategies all confer a selective advantage for viruses to compete for the ribosome and in some cases, allow the viral RNA to be exclusively translated. The strategies described focus on viral mechanisms in metazoa. Due to space limitations, the diverse translational mechanisms found in plant viruses will not be discussed and readers are directed to several excellent reviews.3, 4, 5 Before delving into specific examples, the canonical translation initiation pathway will be briefly reviewed to develop a greater appreciation for these alternate mechanisms of translation.",

            "text": "Translation, which includes the processes of initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling, is a tightly regulated process that involves decoding of the genetic information stored within a messenger RNA (mRNA) into a functional polypeptide sequence. During elongation, the ribosome translocates codon by codon as aminoacyl\u2010transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are sampled to ensure the delivery of the cognate amino acid into the nascent polyprotein chain. In eukaryotes, the majority of mRNAs bear a 5\u2032 7\u2010methyl\u2010guanosine cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, both of which mediate translation initiation via a cap\u2010dependent mechanism (Figure 1). The cap moiety binds the cap\u2010binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, which is in complex with eIF4G and eIF4A to form eIF4F. eIF4A facilitates unwinding of RNA secondary structures during scanning. eIF4G acts as a scaffold that recruits factors to the 5\u2032 end, and through interaction with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) bound to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, mediates circularization of the mRNA. The 43S preinitiation complex comprised of the 40S ribosomal subunit, the ternary complex eIF2\u00b7Met\u2010tRNAi\u00b7GTP, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF5 is delivered to the 5\u2032 end of the transcript via interaction of eIF3 with eIF4G. In a process that is facilitated by eIF1 and 1A, the complex subsequently undergoes directional scanning to locate the authentic AUG codon positioned within a favorable context. Start codon recognition by the initiator Met\u2010tRNAi within the ribosomal P site results in hydrolysis of the eIF2\u2010bound GTP, release of the Pi, and dissociation of initiation factors. Hydrolysis of GTP and subsequent release of eIF5B facilitate 60S joining and the formation of an elongation\u2010competent ribosome.

            "text": "In contrast to cap\u2010dependent translation, some viruses utilize a noncanonical mode of translation termed internal ribosome entry. This translation mechanism involves a cis\u2010acting, generally structured RNA element called an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which is often found in the untranslated region (UTR) of a viral genome.9 IRESs recruit the ribosome internally within the viral RNA in a 5\u2032 end\u2010independent manner and afford the viral genome the ability to hijack the translational machinery for viral protein synthesis during infection. IRESs were first described in picornaviruses, where the 5\u2032\u2010UTRs of poliovirus (PV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) mediate internal ribosome recruitment and initiate translation within the context of bicistronic reporter constructs.10, 11 Subsequent analyses through the concerted efforts of various groups have demonstrated that other picornaviral IRESs exist in the genomes of foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV),12, 13 human rhinoviruses,14 and hepatitis A virus (HAV).15, 16 These IRES elements share a common dependence on many canonical initiation factors including the ternary complex eIF2\u00b7Met\u2010tRNAi\u00b7GTP, eIF4A, eIF3, and the C\u2010terminal domain of eIF4G (for review see Ref 17). The fact that IRESs can mediate internal ribosome recruitment was irrevocably demonstrated through the discovery that an artificially synthesized circularized RNA harboring the EMCV IRES can initiate translation, proving that this mechanism of initiation does not depend on linear scanning of the translational apparatus.18 In general, IRESs utilize only a subset of the canonical translation factors and may also use auxiliary proteins called IRES trans\u2010acting factors (ITAFs), which are proteins that are not normally involved in translation but are usurped for IRES\u2010mediated translation. Because of the reduced requirement for initiation factors, IRES translation is active under conditions such as virus infection and cellular stress when the activities of specific targeted translation initiation factors are compromised. How does a viral IRES gain advantage over cap\u2010dependent translation? In the case of PV, the viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro not only process the viral polyprotein but also target and cleave host translation eIFs, including the scaffold protein eIF4G and PABP, which in effect leads to the shutoff of host protein synthesis and an increase in the availability of ribosomes and translation factors for viral RNA translation.19, 20, 21, 22 However, because of the limited factor requirement for PV IRES translation, the viral proteins are preferentially translated during infection (see below). Since these initial findings, additional IRES elements have been identified in other viruses as well as in a subset of cellular mRNAs.23 Thus, viral IRESs allow hijacking of the host translational machinery to mediate preferential, and in some cases like PV infection, an exclusive switch from cap\u2010dependent to viral IRES\u2010dependent protein synthesis.",

            "text": "IRESs can be classified into four primary classes based on the requirement for canonical initiation factors, initiator Met\u2010tRNAi and ITAFs.9 The picornavirus IRESs are further divided into several subgroups. Types I and II picornavirus IRESs, exemplified by the PV and EMCV IRESs, respectively, have similar factor requirements. However, while the ribosome is directly recruited to the AUG start codon on the EMCV type II IRES, it must scan a short distance to the initiation codon following recruitment on the PV type I IRES.24, 25 HAV IRES is a member of a minor group designated type III, as it is mechanistically distinct from other picornaviral IRES elements.26, 27, 28 It is generally (reasonably) assumed that IRESs from the same viral family utilize a similar mechanism for translation initiation. However, recent studies into other picornaviral IRESs identified two additional subtypes: one type, best exemplified by Simian picornavirus type 9 and porcine teschovirus 1, encompasses IRES elements that bear remarkable similarities to the hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010like IRESs,29, 30, 31, 32 while another type, exemplified by Aichivirus (AV), includes members of the Kobuvirus, Salivirus, and Paraturdivirus genera.33, 34 This further demonstrates that IRESs from the same family may mediate translation via distinct mechanisms.",

Unlike type I and II IRESs, the AV IRES is completely dependent on DHX29,34 which is a DExH\u2010Box helicase shown previously to be involved in translational initiation of mRNAs with structured 5\u2032 UTRs.35, 36 As the initiation codon of the AV IRES is buried within a stable hairpin structure, it is proposed that DHX29 is required for unwinding of the hairpin to allow access to the initiator Met\u2010tRNAi.\n34 This finding raises the possibility of unique IRES translation mechanisms and factor requirements within the same viral family. Similarly, recent work involving the picornaviral HAV IRES suggests that the precise strategy by which IRESs mediate translation is governed by specific cellular conditions that persist during infection. Initial characterization of the 5\u2032\u2010noncoding region of HAV suggested that it shares many similar structural motifs with the EMCV IRES.37 Despite this similarity, however, the HAV IRES differs substantially in its requirements for optimal activity. Most notably, while other picornaviral IRESs are resistant to or stimulated by 2Apro, the HAV IRES is strongly inhibited under the same conditions.27 The dependence of the HAV IRES on an intact eIF4G/eIF4F complex is supported by several lines of evidence. The addition of purified eIF4F complexes following protease treatment was demonstrated to rescue HAV IRES\u2010mediated translation.26, 28 In a related manner, methylated cap analog, eIF4E\u2010binding protein 1, or rotavirus nsp3 inhibit HAV IRES function by modulation of eIF4F.26, 28 Recent reports demonstrate that 2Apro and Lpro exhibit contradicting effects on HAV IRES translation; while 2Apro impairs HAV IRES function, the FMDV Lpro strongly stimulated IRES activity, even upon proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G and arsenite\u2010induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1.38 Resistance to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is reminiscent of PV and EMCV IRES\u2010mediated translation, as translation can proceed in an eIF2\u2010independent fashion late in infection.39, 40 While these findings are intriguing and may help reconcile differences that are previously thought to differentiate HAV IRES from other picornavirus IRESs, they warrant further investigations to determine the cause of divergence from previously published results.",

            "text": "Of the IRES classes, group I IRESs, exemplified by members of the Dicistroviridae family, have the most streamlined mechanism of action. Dicistroviruses are positive\u2010sense RNA viruses that are primarily pathogenic to arthropods.41 Noteworthy members of this class include the Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and Drosophila C virus (DCV) which are infectious to a number of insect species including the genetically tractable model Drosophila melanogaster; and the honeybee viruses including the Israeli acute paralysis, Acute bee paralysis virus, and Kashmir bee virus which have been recently implicated in the colony collapse disorder of honeybees.42 The name of the family is derived from the viral genome organization, which contains two main open reading frames that are translated under the regulation of two distinct IRES elements.43 The 5\u2032 proximal cistron is under the regulation of the 5\u2032 UTR IRES and encodes viral nonstructural proteins, whereas the downstream cistron encoding viral structural proteins is regulated by the intergenic region (IGR) IRES (Figure 2(a)). The two ORFs are distinctly regulated during infection; the viral structural proteins are produced in molar excess of the nonstructural proteins (nsps).43, 48, 49 Studies of the 5\u2032 UTR IRESs have been limited. It has been shown that the Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) 5\u2032 UTR IRES, which can direct translation in a number of systems including rabbit reticulocyte lysates, insect lysates, and wheat germ extracts50, 51 uses limited translation factors and exhibits an absolute dependence on eIF1, eIF2, and eIF3 for 48S formation.52 The 5\u2032 UTR IRESs lack sequence conservation,53 and although it remains to be investigated, it seems unlikely that other dicistroviral 5\u2032 UTR IRESs exhibit the same factor requirement as the RhPV 5\u2032 UTR IRES. In contrast, the IGR IRES has been extensively studied through biochemical and structural approaches to reveal an unprecedented mechanism of action. Remarkably, the IGR IRES directly recruits the 40S and 80S ribosome in the absence of initiation factors or initiator Met\u2010tRNAi.\n54, 55, 56 Moreover, the IRES functionally mimics a tRNA to occupy the ribosomal P site and direct translation initiation from the ribosomal A site using a non\u2010AUG codon.55, 56, 57 The unique triple\u2010pseudoknotted structure of the IGR IRES allows it to adopt two functional domains, including a solvent\u2010inaccessible domain largely responsible for direct ribosome binding54, 58, 59 and a tRNA\u2010mimicry domain that bears remarkable structural similarities to an authentic codon:anticodon pairing46, 56 (Figure 2(b)\u2013(d)). The tRNA\u2010mimicry domain primes the ribosome into an elongation\u2010like mode where the initial pseudo\u2010translocation step mediated by eEF2 occurs in the absence of peptide bond formation.60, 61\n",

The IGR IRES occupies the intersubunit space proximal to the decoding center, with specific contacts to the ribosomal P and E sites (Figure 2(e)).47, 63 Binding induces conformational changes in the IGR IRES, where it retracts from the A site toward the E site of the ribosome.47 Reciprocal conformational changes are also observed in the ribosome itself. IRES binding to the 40S subunit alone results in a rotation of the head relative to the body.47 An additional connection is also established between the head and the shoulder on the solvent accessible side of the subunit, which may be involved in latch closure to the mRNA entry channel to effectively anchor the 3\u2032 end of the incoming mRNA.47 Remarkably, 60S subunit joining causes a reversion in the head rotation and opening of the mRNA channel, possibly facilitating delivery of the first incoming aminoacyl\u2010tRNA.47 Interestingly, binding of an unrelated IRES, the HCV IRES, to the ribosome induces similar conformational changes, suggesting that such structural rearrangements may be intrinsic to ribosome function and underlie the ability of these IRES elements to manipulate the ribosome (compare Figures 2(e) and 3(b)).47, 65\n",

Following 40S binding, the HCV IRES then recruits eIF3 and eIF2\u00b7Met\u2010tRNAi to form 48S complexes that are properly positioned at the initiation site.67, 68 Interestingly, unlike the IGR IRES which binds exclusively within the mRNA cleft of the ribosome, cryo\u2010EM studies revealed that the HCV IRES is mostly located on the solvent side of the 40S with only domain II of the IRES occupying near the E site of the ribosome (Figure 3(b)).65, 69 The HCV IRES adopts an open RNA structure consisting of distinct domains to mediate specific functions during IRES translation.

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of HCV IRES\u2010mediated translation is not fully understood, structural studies have provided mechanistic insight into how it hijacks the ribosome. As described above, after the HCV IRES directly recruits the 40S subunit, the eIF2 ternary complex and eIF3 play essential roles in facilitating proper ribosome positioning at the AUG start codon.67, 72 It has been proposed that eIF3 acts as a structural scaffold to facilitate 40S positioning but its mechanistic role in HCV IRES translation has not been elucidated. In a recent report, using the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) IRES, an HCV\u2010like IRES, cryo\u2010EM studies comparing the position of eIF3 within the 43S or IRES\u2010ribosome complexes reveal conformational discrepancies.66 In the 43S preinitiation complex, eIF3 forms extensive contacts with specific ribosomal proteins (RPs).66 In contrast, eIF3 binds exclusively to the IRES within the IRES\u2010ribosome complex, suggesting that the IRES (particularly domain III) functionally displaces eIF3 to gain access to the ribosome (Figure 3(c)). This finding suggests a possible strategy whereby the IRES evicts eIF3 from the 43S complex to minimize competition of cellular mRNAs for the translational machinery.66 To substantiate this finding, primer extension analysis demonstrated that 48S complex formation on \u03b2\u2010globin mRNA was reduced upon addition of HCV\u2010like IRES domain IIIabc, which alone is sufficient for eIF3 binding.66 Although it is unknown whether this represents a viable strategy to outcompete host transcripts within the context of virus infection, it nevertheless provides insight into how HCV\u2010like IRESs may usurp the host translational machinery. Structural analyses have similarly been useful in illuminating events downstream of initiation during HCV IRES\u2010mediated translation. Through the use of cryo\u2010EM, complemented by NMR and biochemical approaches, Kieft and colleagues demonstrated that domain IIb of the HCV IRES is responsible for promoting a switch from translation initiation to elongation and suggests that the IRES has roles beyond ribosome recruitment and positioning at the initiation site.78 Mutants bearing deletions or substitutions in this specific region could still effectively assemble 80S ribosomes and correctly position the start codon, but exhibited moderate impairment in the first translocation event.78 These findings provided the first documented example in which ribosome assembly on the HCV IRES is uncoupled from the initial translocation step. Translocation on the HCV IRES necessitates ribosomal conformational changes that are mediated by a putative interaction between the HCV IRES domain II and RPS5.65, 79 In domain IIb mutants, this essential interaction is absent, thus resulting in a defect in translocation.78 It remains to be investigated whether this property is specific for HCV IRES or a general strategy utilized by other viral IRESs. These findings add to the existing roles of domain II in HCV IRES translation including 60S joining, eIF5\u2010induced hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2, eIF3j dissociation, and configuration of the RNA in the decoding groove.68, 80, 81, 82\n",

Tissue tropism was initially thought to be associated with the requirement of specific cell surface receptors or the dependence of the viral life cycle on factors that are expressed exclusively in liver cells; however, this speculation was overturned by the discovery that viral RNA abundance is modulated by the liver\u2010specific microRNA (miRNA), miR\u2010122.64 Indeed, exogenous expression of miR\u2010122 greatly enhanced HCV abundance in nonhepatic cells.90 The HCV genome contains three potential miR\u2010122 binding sites identified through base complementarity with the miRNA seed sequence: one within the variable sequence of the 3\u2032 UTR and two in the 5\u2032 UTR (Figure 3(a), sequences in red). Sequestration of miR\u2010122 by antisense oligonucleotides or disruption of the miRNA seed match resulted in a decrease in viral RNA abundance.64 Expression of artificial miRNAs bearing compensatory mutations that restored the seed match ameliorated these effects, indicating a direct interaction of miR\u2010122 with the HCV binding sites.64, 91, 92 How does miR\u2010122 mediate HCV replication? Given the role of miRNAs on translation, it was proposed that miR\u2010122 affected translation of the HCV mRNA. Viral RNA accumulation was suggested to be a result of miR\u2010122\u2010dependent stimulation of the HCV IRES and required both binding sites within the 5\u2032 UTR to be intact.92, 93 Additionally, the 3\u2032 region of miR\u2010122 downstream of the seed sequence is essential and stimulation is facilitated by Argonaute (Ago) proteins94 and the P body protein LSm1.95 Although the contribution of miR\u2010122 on HCV translation is moderate, the finding that a miRNA positively affects translation is in line with other reports that miRNAs can function positively and contrasts their conventional role in translational repression.96 Furthermore, insertion of the miR\u2010122 binding site into the 3\u2032 UTR of a reporter RNA negated the stimulatory effects and instead, conferred the canonical repressive function of miRNAs.92 In contrast to the modest translational effects, recent reports have proposed that the major role of miR\u2010122, in association with Ago2, is to prevent decay of the HCV genome, independently of its translation status.97 The exonuclease Xrn1 was shown to degrade the HCV RNA and miR\u2010122 binding functions to protect the HCV RNA from degradation.98 Interestingly, supplementation of miR\u2010122 or specific knockdown of Xrn1 has redundant and nonadditive effects on HCV RNA stability.98 However, due to the inability of Xrn1 knockdown to rescue viral replication defects from impaired miR\u2010122 binding, miR\u2010122 may have additional roles in the viral life cycle that are yet unidentified.98 Though a comprehensive understanding of miR\u2010122 function on the HCV life cycle is still lacking, its roles in HCV IRES stimulation and RNA stabilization suggest a multifaceted mode of regulation by miRNAs that may be prevalent in other viruses.",

The first indication of this process came through studies of some viruses bearing IRES elements, including PV, HCV, and CrPV. A genome\u2010wide siRNA screen for genes involved in DCV infection of Drosophila S2 cells identified 66 ribosomal proteins that are required for DCV IGR IRES\u2010mediated translation and virus infection.101 Surprisingly, while knockdown of ribosomal proteins had relatively modest effects on cap\u2010dependent translation, IRES\u2010mediated translation was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, it was shown that this translational defect is not specific to insect viruses, but is observed also for PV infection.101 These initial findings suggested that the general integrity of the ribosome may be important in promoting viral growth. The notion that specific ribosomes may mediate translation of distinct classes of mRNAs was spawned by studies on the role of RPS25 on IGR IRES translation. In IGR IRES\u2010ribosome complexes, RPS25 crosslinks specifically with the ribosome binding domain of the IRES,102 and cryo\u2010EM reconstructions suggest that the IRES interacts with a protein adjacent to RPS5 that has no prokaryotic homolog.63 Additionally, RPS25\u2010deficient ribosomes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit significantly diminished binding to the IGR IRES, and IRES translational activity is negligible in yeast translation extracts prepared from RPS25\u2010deficient strains.103 Interestingly, cryo\u2010EM studies revealed that RPS25 and the neighboring RPS5 together constitute the primary interface for ribosome\u2010IGR IRES binding.59, 103\nIn vivo characterization of the role of RPS25 in CrPV IGR IRES and HCV IRES function revealed that while global translation was only minimally affected, the loss of RPS25 yielded a significant impairment in IRES activity.104, 105 Similarly, the activities of structurally and functionally diverse IRES elements including the CSFV, EMCV, PV, and EV71 IRESs and a subset of cellular IRESs were also affected,104 suggesting that specific ribosomal proteins may have evolved to accommodate IRES translation in general. Because the IGR IRES and HCV IRESs can recruit the 40S subunit directly, it is reasonable to propose that specific ribosomal proteins such as RPS25 may interact directly with and facilitate recruitment of the IRES (Figure 4). Furthermore, it may also provide an explanation as to why these IRESs may not function in prokaryotes, which do not have RPS25. However, in the case of picornaviruses such as PV and EV71, it is not clear how RPs contribute to infection, as these IRESs require a multitude of factors to recruit the ribosome. Nevertheless, the common requirement for specific ribosomal proteins and specialized ribosomes suggest that diverse viral IRESs may in fact share more mechanistic features than initially thought.",

Through an siRNA screen of ribosomal proteins required for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, eight ribosomal proteins, including RPL40, were shown to play an intrinsic role in viral mRNA translation but not global translation (Figure 4).107 The VSV viral genome, which is both capped and polyadenylated, is thought to be translated via a distinct cap\u2010dependent mechanism. During infection, host translational repression is achieved, in part, by the hypophosphorylation of eIF4E\u2010binding protein 1 (4E\u2010BP1), which effectively disrupts formation of the eIF4F complex through sequestration of eIF4E.111, 112 Despite having extensive similarities to host mRNAs, viral RNAs can escape translational shutoff and translation proceeds via an RPL40\u2010dependent mechanism, likely through cis\u2010acting elements present in the viral 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR elements.107 RPL40 facilitates VSV translation at the level of initiation, and as a ribosomal constituent (as opposed to its potential extra\u2010ribosomal functions).107 Other viruses related to VSV, including the rabies virus, measles virus, and Newcastle disease virus, all have a similar sensitivity to RPL40 depletion; more intriguingly, however, is the identification of a small subset of cellular mRNAs, through sequencing polysome\u2010associated RNAs, that are expressed by a RPL40\u2010dependent pathway.107 This suggests that VSV and related viruses may have usurped an endogenous translational pathway.",

In an attempt to understand how rRNA modifications contribute to the pathogenesis of X\u2010linked dyskeratosis congenita, a fatal disease characterized by bone marrow failure and an increased susceptibility to cancer, Ruggero and coworkers have identified a specific requirement of rRNA pseudouridylation in IRES translation.109 While global translation is not affected, the loss of pseudouridine synthase activity results in a significant downregulation of p27, XIAP, and Bcl\u2010xL translation. Furthermore, the effect is not exclusive to cellular IRES elements but is also observed with the CrPV IRES, suggesting an intrinsic ribosomal defect in IRES\u2010dependent translation.109 Further investigation into the molecular mechanism revealed that it is attributable to a decrease in affinity of pseudouridine\u2010deficient ribosomes for the CrPV IGR IRES, and that this defect is conserved from lower to higher eukaryotes.110 Pseudouridine\u2010deficient ribosomes also exhibited other translational defects including reduced translational fidelity and maintenance of translational reading frame, altered sensitivities to translational inhibitors, and reduced ribosome\u2010tRNA affinities.110 Because these defects are governed in part by tRNA binding and that the CrPV IGR IRES also adopts a tRNA\u2010like conformation, it is speculated that the loss of pseudouridylation manifests as a universal defect in ribosome\u2010ligand binding.110 There are 91 known pseudouridylation modification sites within human rRNA.114 Whether specific pseudouridylation modifications within the rRNA are responsible for IRES binding remains to be examined.

Because translation initiation is the rate\u2010limiting step that is tightly regulated by the availability of canonical initiation factors, constituents of the eIF4F cap\u2010binding complex represent major targets for translational control. PV\u2010mediated translational repression provides an exemplary way in which the virus modulates canonical initiation factors for its exclusive usage while consequently rendering the host cell incapable of translation initiation. Translational repression is initiated by cleavage of eIF4GI by 2Apro, and proceeds to completion by cleavage of the more resistant functional homolog, eIF4GII.19, 20 Furthermore, the proteases 3Cpro and 2Apro lead to cleavage of PABP.21 Cleavage of eIF4G and PABP effectively inactivates the cap\u2010binding complex essential to canonical translation initiation. The proteolysis of eIF4G generates two cleavage products that have disparate functions: an amino\u2010terminal fragment containing the eIF4E binding domain115, 116 and a carboxyl\u2010terminal fragment containing the eIF3 and eIF4A binding sites.116, 117 While cap\u2010dependent translation is severely impaired by eIF4G cleavage, the C\u2010terminal proteolytic product of eIF4G is necessary and sufficient in supporting IRES\u2010mediated translation.118 A specific and direct interaction between PV IRES domain V and the central core of eIF4G is essential for ribosome recruitment.119 This interaction promotes eIF4A recruitment, and by association with eIF3 (likely as a constituent of the 43S complex), allows hijacking of the ribosome during infection.25 Interestingly, a recent report demonstrated that upregulation of miR\u2010141 during enterovirus EV71 infection results in the targeted inhibition of eIF4E. Transfection of antagomiR\u2010141 (antisense miR\u2010144) delayed host translational shutoff and moderately attenuated virus production.120 Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR\u2010141 resulted in shutoff of cap\u2010dependent translation concomitant with an increase in IRES translation.120 Thus, this study reveals an additional level of regulation that acts in coordination with the cleavage of eIF4G and PABP to ensure efficient shutoff of host translation and to promote the switch to IRES translation. Therefore, viral modulation of initiation factors helps to establish an environment that minimizes the ability of cellular transcripts to compete for the translational machinery to thereby promote its own preferential translation.",

DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) use a strategy to actively assemble eIF4F complex to mediate cap\u2010dependent viral protein synthesis despite suppressing host protein synthesis during virus infection.121, 122 For example, during HSV\u20101 infection, the viral protein ICP6 binds to eIF4G to promote eIF4F assembly.122 In contrast, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection does not lead to inhibition of host translation and thus, viral translation proceeds concomitantly with host protein synthesis.123 Insights of this mechanism have come to light. Under HCMV infection, the virus modulates the pool of translation initiation factors to actively promote eIF4F formation.124, 125, 126, 127 In particular, cellular poly(A) binding protein (PABP1) is translationally stimulated and accumulates in the cytoplasm124 (in contrast to the nuclear retention of PABP described in HSV\u20101128, 129 and KSHV infections121, 130). Translational upregulation is dependent on the terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif within the 5\u2032 UTR of PABP1 and requires mTORC1 activation by the viral\u2010encoded UL38 mTORC1 activator.131 Preventing PABP accumulation impairs eIF4F assembly and decreased viral titer, suggesting that newly\u2010synthesized PABP facilitates eIF4F formation on viral RNAs.131 Thus, remodeling of translational complexes can be achieved by viral modulation of initiation factor levels, which has significant implications on the ability of the virus to mount a productive infection. Interestingly, HCMV infection coordinately increases the levels of the PABP1 repressor, Paip2, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD1, which targets Paip2 for proteolytic degradation.132 This effect at first seemed paradoxical, as it neutralizes the virus' attempt to upregulate PABP1. However, the increase in Paip2 abundance has been established as a virus\u2010induced innate antiviral strategy in response to the upregulation of PABP1.132 The host cell precisely modulates the ratio of PABP1 and its cognate repressor in order to diminish the pool of free PABP1 available for viral translation.132 Although this mechanism of regulation remains to be elucidated under HCMV infection, Paip2 may have a more universal role in regulating PABP1 levels and thus the overall translation profile in the absence of viral infection.",

            "text": "While a common strategy is to target the eIF4F complex (as described above), an alternate and nonexclusive way in which host translational repression can be triggered is through activation of eIF2\u03b1 kinases, which results in the downstream phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2\u03b1 (Figure 5). Upon delivery of the ternary complex eIF2\u00b7Met\u2010tRNAi\u00b7GTP to a start codon, GTP hydrolysis occurs to allow for tRNA accommodation. For subsequent rounds of translation initiation to ensue, eIF2\u00b7GDP must be recycled to eIF2\u00b7GTP in a process mediated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. The \u03b1\u2010subunit of eIF2 is susceptible to phosphorylation by various kinases that are activated during stress conditions as a means to repress translation. eIF2\u03b1\u2010P acts as a potent competitive inhibitor to eIF2B, and impedes its ability to recycle eIF2\u00b7GDP; thus targeting eIF2 serves a fundamental role in altering gene expression during different environmental stresses (for review, see Ref 133). Four eIF2\u03b1 kinases exist in eukaryotes: HRI responds to fluctuations in heme:globin ratios; GCN2 is activated by UV irradiation and amino acid starvation; PERK is triggered by overload of the ER; and PKR is stimulated by dsRNAs. Perhaps the most important eIF2\u03b1 kinase implicated in host antiviral immune defense is PKR, as it acts as a sensor for incoming viral dsRNAs or viral replication intermediates. GCN2 has also been identified as a regulator of the antiviral response, as it is specifically activated upon binding of two nonadjacent regions of the Sindbis virus (SV) genomic RNA to the GCN2 histidyl\u2010tRNA synthetase\u2010related domain.134 Strikingly, GCN2\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts were highly permissive to SV (and to a lesser extent, VSV infection and Semliki forest virus), suggesting the involvement of GCN2 in an innate antiviral response pathway.134 Similarly, HIV\u20101 viral RNA activates GCN2 in vitro, although GCN2 is targeted for cleavage by the HIV\u20101 protease during infection.135 Conceivably, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and the subsequent depletion of the available ternary complex pool is beneficial for the host cell, as incapacitating the translational machinery can restrict viral spread. The identification of viral products that counter the activation of PKR and/or eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to maintain viral translation further points to the importance of eIF2\u03b1 kinases in the antiviral response (for extensive review of such examples, see Ref 136). Alternately, viruses that utilize eIF2\u2010independent modes of translation may actively induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to ameliorate the host antiviral response. IRESs such as the dicistrovirus IGR IRES that can recruit the ribosome independently of factors or initiator Met\u2010tRNAi are translationally stimulated under cellular stresses and virus infections that induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.56, 137 However, there are new data to suggest that viruses may utilize other factors to recruit the Met\u2010tRNAi. For example, eIF5B and ligatin/eIF2D can deliver Met\u2010tRNAi to the 40S ribosome bound to some viral mRNAs such as HCV IRES\u2010like RNAs.138, 139, 140, 141 Interestingly, HCV IRES\u2010mediated translation is stimulated upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by PKR or under conditions that decrease eIF2 activity.142, 143 The fact that the eIF2 ternary complex is dispensable for HCV translation presents an interesting conundrum, since ternary complex\u2010mediated positioning of the 40S at the initiator codon is a prerequisite for HCV translation.67 The significance of eIF2D during virus infection remains to be determined. In addition to the role of eIF2D on viral translation, recent studies have implicated another Met\u2010tRNAi\u2010interacting protein, eIF2A, on HCV IRES translation. In this study, eIF2A knockdown and repletion studies demonstrate that eIF2A is responsible for Met\u2010tRNAi delivery during stress conditions and is required for HCV proliferation.144 Upon infection, eIF2A is relocalized from the nucleus (and partially the cytoplasm) to an exclusively cytoplasmic distribution, where recruitment to the viral genome occurs by direct interaction with domain IIId of the HCV IRES.144 Since phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 occurs under HCV infection, it is speculated that eIF2A\u2010dependent translation may play a physiological role during an authentic infection.144\n",

The parameters constituting a \u22121 PRF have been extensively defined in viral genomes and involve a \u2018slippery\u2019 heptanucleotide RNA motif with the consensus X_XXY_YYZ and a downstream stimulating element (usually a pseudoknot, and in some cases, a stable hairpin) located six to eight nucleotides from the 3\u2032 boundary of the slippery sequence (Figure 6(a)).148, 149, 150, 151 A slippery sequence alone is insufficient for frameshifting to occur152, 153; the additional stimulatory element is required to induce sufficient pausing of the elongating ribosome such that the interactions between the mRNA and the A\u2010 and P\u2010site tRNAs are disrupted to allow translocation into an alternate frame.154 Because only the wobble positions of the \u22121 frame codons are changed relative to the reference frame, \u22121 decoding involves re\u2010pairing of the mRNA with near\u2010cognate tRNAs. By reconstituting an active \u22121 frameshifting event using mammalian ribosomes and a variant of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal, cryo\u2010EM reconstructions of the stalled complexes provided significant insight into the conformational rearrangements and mechanical tensions that occur during the decoding of a ribosomal frameshift.155 Most notably, the stimulatory pseudoknot obstructs the entrance of the mRNA channel and induces a ratchet\u2010like rearrangement that traps the eEF2 translocase in an orientation that precludes A\u2010site tRNA binding.155 Additionally, the P\u2010site tRNA undergoes structural deformation that results from a bending of the D\u2010arm, suggesting that the distortable nature of the tRNA might be essential in the frameshifting process.155 These cryo\u2010EM structures provide a mechanical explanation for frameshifting, wherein the ribosome attempting to undergo eEF2\u2010catalyzed translocation is counteracted by the blockage of the mRNA channel and occlusion of the A site.155 This resistance distorts the P\u2010site tRNA and places sufficient strain on the anticodon\u2013codon interaction that causes their dissociation.155 Alleviation of this strain likely promotes realignment of the anticodon with the codon in the \u22121 direction and the occurrence of a frameshifting event.155\n",

In HIV\u20101 and other related retroviruses, the expression of the viral proteins, including the RNA\u2010dependent DNA polymerase, is under the regulation of frameshift signals.156, 157, 158 Classical translation of the viral mRNA terminates at a stop codon to generate exclusively the gag protein, which represents the precursor for the viral structural proteins. Via a \u22121 PRF approximately 200 nucleotides upstream of the gag stop codon, the gag\u2010pol fusion is generated from which the viral enzymes are derived (for review, see Ref 159). The frequency of frameshift thus dictates the precise ratio of the viral structural and nonstructural proteins, which is crucial to the assembly of an infectious virion. Deviation of this ratio results in a decrease in viral yield.160 Though initially described in retroviral genomes, PRFs have since been documented in many other viruses and cellular genes and are more prevalent than originally thought. While \u22121 PRF appears to be the predominant type of frameshifting, examples of +1 PRF are limited. Well characterized modes of +1 PRF have been found in the yeast Ty1 and Ty3 retrotransposons which, similar to \u22121 PRF, are dependent on cis\u2010acting elements161, 162 (Figure 6(a)).",

Computational analysis of various genotype isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the Arteriviridae family, revealed a region of increased conservation in the +1 reading frame encoding viral nsp 2, designated as nsp2TF.166 Mass spectrometric and biochemical analyses demonstrated definitively that translation of nsp2TF occurs via a \u22122 PRF and necessitates both a G GUU UUU motif at the shift site and a downstream CCCANCUCC for efficient ribosomal frameshifting (Figure 6(a)).166 Interestingly, nsp2TF is partitioned to specific foci under infection and is excluded from replication structures where nsp2 resides.166 The observation that nsp2TF frameshift mutants severely impair virus replication further substantiates the physiological role of nsp2TF during infection. While the precise role of nsp2TF is currently unknown, the novel mode of frameshifting adds to the complexity in discerning the coding potential of a compact viral genome. It is also known that sequences downstream of the \u22122 PRF signal can also mediate a \u22121 PRF to generate the two viral replicase precursor polyproteins.168, 169 Thus, many regulatory mechanisms must be in place to ensure that appropriate partitioning of translating ribosomes occurs to allow specific viral proteins to be expressed at precise times during the viral life cycle.",

While these strategies are diverse and yield differing outcomes on the translational status of the host, they provide unique means to outcompete cellular mRNAs in support of the efficient and sometimes exclusive production of viral proteins. Other mechanisms may function to increase the overall viral coding capacity, which is advantageous in the context of compact genomes. Although many noncanonical mechanisms have been identified and characterized, recent advances in bioinformatic and biochemical approaches have driven the discovery of novel viral translational strategies. For example, technologies such as SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) in combination with Click chemistry have proven useful in the identification and quantification of newly\u2010synthesized proteins.172, 173 Ribosome profiling has also provided a complementary approach in examining RNAs that are translated. The subcodon resolution of this technique has made it possible to obtain genome\u2010wide insight into processes intrinsic to translation, including reading frame selection and initiation codon usage.174 In fact, insights into ribosomal frameshift were gleaned not only from bioinformatic approaches but also from ribosomal profiling.175 These techniques have been fundamental in expanding our understanding of the translational responses that occur upon viral infection and other cellular stresses, and will only increasingly perpetuate the discovery of novel translational mechanisms. In light of our increasing understanding of translational control mechanisms, new antiviral therapeutics can also be developed through the discovery of novel compounds that specifically target viral translational pathways176, 177 or modulate viral frameshift elements.178\n",

The translation cycle involves the steps of initiation, characterized by the recruitment and positioning of the ribosome at the translational start site; elongation, where amino acids are sequentially added to the growing polypeptide chain; and termination, where the nascent polypeptide is released from the ribosome. Programmed ribosomal frameshifts (PRFs) act on an elongating ribosome whereas translational reading frame selection mediated by the IGR IRES occurs at the level of initiation. (a) Three types of PRFs, including the \u22121, +1 and \u22122 PRFs, have been identified in various viral genomes. In the \u22121 PRF, the frameshift site is comprised of a heptanucleotide sequence with the consensus X_XXY_YYZ (where X represents any nucleotide, Y represents A or U, Z represents A, C, or U, and the underscores designate the codons in the 0 frame) and a downstream spacer sequence. While the consensus for \u22121 PRFs is well characterized, the frameshift consensus in +1 PRF is more variable. \u22121 PRFs require a 3\u2032 stimulatory element and +1 PRFs depend on cis\u2010elements that facilitate the displacement of the ribosome into an alternate frame. The \u22122 PRF, recently identified in the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, produces a transframe fusion (TF). The \u22122 PRF occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence and is stimulated by a conserved downstream CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nucleotides downstream.
