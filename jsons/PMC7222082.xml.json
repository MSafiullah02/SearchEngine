Application of colostrum to the buccal mucosa (oral colostrum, OC) may provide early immunologic benefit to the preterm infant and provision of colostrum may facilitate maternal milk production [7].",

Of note, urinary sIgA was positively associated with total number of OC doses received. This finding is novel because all sampling was done prior to the initiation of enteral feedings, so absorbed sIgA and lactoferrin are attributable solely to intake via OC.

Since early OC results in greater cumulative doses administered and, therefore, greater immune protein concentrations, it is necessary to further emphasize the importance of early milk expression to all staff. These findings support the idea that mothers of preterm infants face unique challenges to early milk production, likely related either to insufficient breast priming, stress, or medical diagnoses that contributed to preterm labor. Although there was staff education, more direct support from staff in Labor & Delivery and NICU is required. We now emphasize the importance of immediate postpartum milk expression during antenatal consultations for all mothers likely to deliver prematurely. We have empowered our staff to encourage transfer of any amount of milk to the NICU immediately after delivery.",

The differences in retinopathy of prematurity, however, reflect the practice changes in monitoring oxygen satuartions during this time period. This study enrolled infants who were not ordered to receive enteral feedings until after 72 h. As this practice is contrary to our NICU guidelines of early enteral nutrition, it is likely that study infants were sicker than the usual preterm population, and provides a rationale for the observations of delays in time to full enteral feeding and the higher incidence of comorbidities.",
