The first two weeks of the intervention focused on addressing logistical challenges to EMR patient portal enrollment, patient scheduling, utilization of the telemedicine platform, and streamlining communication between providers, clinical support staff, and clerical support staff.

However, many aspects of adolescent and young adult care recommended by Bright Futures were possible to implement via telemedicine including screening for depression, substance use, psycho-social development (e.g. the HEADDS Assessment), and general anticipatory guidance.[21]",

The rapid implementation of telemedicine for mental health services was critical as we saw an influx of college-aged youth returning home abruptly from campuses and requiring mental health support and medication refills due to loss of college-based providers or new onset of acute stress responses secondary to the pandemic. One challenge providers faced was how to appropriately manage medications for conditions typically managed by psychiatrists (e.g. antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines).

As such, we collaborated with our psychiatry colleagues to refine a protocol for family members to calibrate home scales and take blind weights prior to telemedicine visits. In other cases, therapists or primary care providers measured weights and vital signs and forwarded these data to our team. Finally, when a patient was clearly engaged in concerning behaviors (e.g. increased restricting, purging, over exercising), or the provider, therapist, patient, or family member had a high index of suspicion for medical deterioration, the patient was asked to come in for one of the clinic\u2019s limited in-person sessions for measurement of weight, orthostatic vital signs, and any indicated blood work (e.g. electrolyte monitoring).

We expanded care to new patients after March 31, 2020 when the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), issued guidelines allowing appropriately-credentialed providers to admit and treat new patients with OUD and to prescribe buprenorphine using telemedicine platforms without initial in-person assessments during the COVID-19 public health emergency.[23] As a program funded by SAMHSA, YoSUP is legally required to complete structured intakes that include demographic, diagnostic, physical health, and mental health information.[24] To ensure that new patients completed federally required intake interviews, our program support staff began conducting these via Zoom\u00a9 before each patient\u2019s first physician telemedicine visit. We asked that, whenever possible, youth and their parents log in to visits from different devices or have access to separate private spaces to facilitate separate but co-occurring confidential meetings with clinicians and social workers. For youth in need of psychiatric assessments for comorbid disorders, our providers also transitioned to telepsychiatry. As most components of the clinical opiate withdrawal scale can be assessed via video connection, we plan to conduct buprenorphine inductions using telemedicine for youth who can enlist a loved one to provide support. We will offer in-clinic inductions to youth who do not have access to a support person.",

For example, practices may no longer be able to effectively bill for telemedicine, clinicians currently using HIPAA non-compliant applications may need systems-level supports to transition to different platforms, and addiction medicine providers may no longer be able to prescribe medications for treatment of OUD using only telemedicine.",

For example, AYAs may live in unsafe conditions involving abuse or violence, where discussions during a telemedicine visit at home could put them in danger or they may not be able to safely disclose all of their concerns.

Strategies for collaborative decision-making with patients about limitations of telemedicine exams balanced with patient inconvenience and risk (e.g. risk of infection in the COVID-19 pandemic) will need to be explored through further research with patients and providers. Best practices in this regard are also likely to have implications for sexual maturity ratings for adolescent preventative health care visits.",

While telemedicine has potential to expand access to specialty care for both, research is needed to understand the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of telemedicine for these disorders. For eating disorder care, research is needed to assess the accuracy of home weights, hospitalization rates, and long-term recovery outcomes when eating disorders are managed via telemedicine. AYA subspecialists can expand access to care by collaborating with primary care providers via teleconsultation.[7]",
