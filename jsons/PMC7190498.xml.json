Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [7]. The S protein is the most likely target of neutralizing antibodies as it is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein responsible for receptor-binding and virion entry [7]. Viral mutations occur in regions with much stronger MHC-I binding ability, while no other mutations are located near the S receptor-binding domain (RBD, Cys336-Glu516) [8].",

The CD4 T cell response is critical to both antibody production and the killing of infected cells mediated by CD8+ CTLs. In addition, only neutralizing antibodies can fully block viral entry into host cells; however, the general location of the binding of other antibodies would strongly affect the body\u2019s ability to produce neutralizing antibodies [7]. To date, no coronavirus vaccine has been approved [10]. Inactivated SARS-CoV has been demonstrated to offer incomplete protection, whereas purified coronavirus spike protein nanoparticles have been found to induce coronavirus neutralizing antibodies in mice [10]. Therefore, full exposure of neutralizing epitopes with other B cell epitopes are likely to represent important factors in coronavirus vaccine design.",

We found that 15 CD4 epitopes and 17 CD8 T cell epitopes met this requirement. After overlapping integration, there were nine potential CD4 and 11 potential CD8 T cell antigenic determinants (Table 1\n). The RBD region possessed seven CD4 epitopes and nine CD8 T cell epitopes, whereas the tail region has two CD4 epitopes and two CD8 T cell epitopes. Moreover, when comparing these epitopes with verified CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-SPL [16], a one-to-one correspondence was observed (e.g., Ser516-Asn530 [SARS-CoV] to Ser530-Asn544 [SARS-CoV-2]) for the CD4 T cell epitope and Lys411-Val420 (SARS-CoV) to Lys424-Val433 (SARS-CoV-2).",

Moreover, the inclusion of effective B and T cell epitopes is essential for inducing specific humoral and cellular immunity in an ideal vaccine [22]. The recognition of effective B cell epitopes is dependent on antigenicity, accessibility of the surface and assistance of T helper (CD4 T) cells. CD4 T cells are the main components of the immune system found to impart immunological \u2018memory\u2019 to the new strains. Pathogen-specific T cell responses are also required for protection against infection [23]. In addition, a specific cellular response is considered to be equally important for sustainable protection and pathogen elimination, and CD4 T cells assist in promoting the production of antibodies and CTL reactions. The SARS-CoV-2-SPL was found to possess 5 B cell epitopes, 15 CD4 T cell epitopes, and 17 CD8 T cell epitopes, respectively. Moreover, from the overall topology (Fig. 3A), we found that most of these epitopes were exposed on the surface, which is an advantage of a small molecular protein. In addition, the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2-SPL appeared to be compact, which might explain why SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited a stronger affinity with ACE [5]. The preparation of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was successfully performed in our laboratory. A high level of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2-SPL appeared in the Balb/C mice after immunization. However, further neutralization experiments demonstrated that antibodies other than neutralizing antibodies were predominantly generated. In this circumstance, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may exist, which would enhance viral invasion. Thus, a potential vaccine antigen should not contain too many epitopes, especially B cell epitopes. Deleting unnecessary B cell epitopes or inserting neutralizing epitopes to virus-like particles may be a practical means of achieving this reduction.",
