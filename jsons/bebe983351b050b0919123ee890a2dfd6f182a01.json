However, in hyperlink (i.e., higher-order link) prediction, where hyperlinks and non-hyperlinks are treated as \"positive\" and \"negative\" classes respectively, hypergraphs suffer from the problem of extreme class imbalance. Given this context, \"negative sampling\"-under-sampling the negative class of non-hyperlinks-becomes mandatory for performing hyperlink prediction. No prior work on hyperlink prediction deals with this problem. In this work, which is the first of its kind, we deal with this problem in the context of hyperlink prediction. More specifically, we leverage graph sampling techniques for sampling non-hyperlinks in hyperlink prediction. Our analysis clearly establishes the effect of random sampling, which is the norm in both link-as well as hyperlink-prediction. Further, we formalize the notion of \"hardness\" of non-hyperlinks via a measure of density, and analyze its distribution over various negative sampling techniques. We experiment with some real-world hypergraph datasets and provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the effects of negative sampling. We also establish its importance in evaluating hyperlink prediction algorithms. Olivia Flora (a) The SWC hypergraph CNS MNS SNS (b) Edge density and size distribution of non-hyperlinks",

            "text": "Although the problem of hyperlink prediction (HLP) has not been explored much, we have enough literature on the topic [3, 19, 21, 22] (and much more on its graph-variant, viz., link prediction (LP) [11, 14, 15, 18] ) to vouch for its importance. When posed as a supervised learning problem, where \"presence of hyperedge\" and \"absence of hyperedge\" are the positive and negative classes respectively, HLP suffers from extreme class imbalance (ECI), with positive class being the minority one. ECI haunts LP too, and has been thoroughly discussed in the literature as well [7, 12, 13, 20] , but with HLP, the situation is much worse owing to the arbitrariness in the number of nodes allowed in a hyperedge. Hence, the solutions provided to combat ECI in usual networks (graphs) for LP could not be directly extended to HLP, at least not without a careful analysis thereof. We consider the Southern women club (SWC) social hypergraph from Davis et al. [6] illustrated in Fig. 1a that connects eighteen women through twelve hyperlinks, each corresponding to an event they had attended together. All nonhyperlinks from the hypergraph have been plotted in Fig. 1b , with the color shade in each vertical bar denoting edge-density (ref. Definition 1) distribution for a given hyperedge size. Although this being a dense hypergraph is atypical of realworld hypergraphs, we could notice the existence of zero-density non-hyperlinks in the left bottom corner of the plot. However, even for such small a hypergraph, one could compare the positive class size (denoted by red asterisks) w.r.t. that of the negative class (the entire histogram), only to reinforce the existence of ECI in a HLP problem.",

Where on one hand, NS makes the HLP problem computationally tractable, on the other, it poses the danger of misinterpretability of results (comparing two HLP algorithms, for instance) due to test set undersampling.

Of the four, UNS and SNS are both motivated by random NS in LP [2] , and have already been used in the literature to predict new recipes [21] and new email interactions [19] .

The nonhyperlink sizes ofF sam are expected to be binomially distributed, which could be validated by Fig. 2b , which shows the size-distribution (SD) of non-hyperlinks inF sam for one dataset. Figures 2a and 2b show SD of the positive and negative classes respectively.

Moreover, in the context of HLP, since the positive class (of hyperlinks) has an excessively left-skewed distribution, we could end-up solving HLP using a single trivial feature, viz., \"hyperlink size\"! Hence, we limit our discussion on UNS merely to theory, and recommend it never to be used in practice. Neither do we conduct any HLP experiments for UNS in this paper.

As we have already characterized the hardness of predicting the true class of a non-hyperlink in Definition 1 via ED, we could monitor the edge-density distribution (EDD) of non-hyperlinks sampled via SNS against hyperlinks. Figure 3a shows the edge density distribution (EDD) of non-hyperlinks sampled via SNS. It can be seen that most of these non-hyperlinks (negative patterns) have low ED, which makes it \"easy\" for a HLP algorithm to reject them as positive patterns, whose EDD has been plotted in Fig. 2c . Since most hyperlinks have a high ED, it could be assumed that ED among an arbitrary set of nodes has a positive correlation with their probability of forming hyperlinks in the future. The positive class EDD (Fig. 2c) shows that in most cases, incident nodes of a test hyperlink are well-connected with each other-a pattern not observed for non-hyperlinks sampled via SNS (Fig. 3a) . Hence, an SNS based positivenegative split not only poses little challenge to a predictor trained on such a dataset, but also misleads HLP evaluation. An SNS algorithm would sample non-hyperlinks from within the \"blue\" enclosure depicted in the bottom left corner of Fig. 1b . This paves way for yet another NS algorithm: MNS. ",

However, since clique-finding in a graph is an NP-complete problem, we do not compute them directly. Instead, motivated by the geodesic-distance based NS technique by Lichtenwalter et al. [13] , we develop a hypergraph equivalent of their \"1-hop\" sampling approach via a simple heuristic to efficiently sample non-hyperlinks as per Algorithm 2. Since a hyperlink f (positive pattern) forms a clique in the induced graph G H of H, this very information could be exploited to sample a non-hyperlinkf such thatf too follows f . The exact procedure for CNS has been described in Algorithm 2.",

Extensions to CNS (e.g., to add/remove multiple nodes at once, etc.) could also be implemented. Moreover, by no means does Algorithm 2 sample all possible cliques; it only gives a sample which we use for HLP. CNS ensures all sampled non-hyperlinks to have a unit ED (ref. Fig. 3c) , which is much different from SNS (ref. Fig. 3a) , where most of them have extremely low ED (if not zero). Hence, CNS provides the hardest of non-hyperlinks whereas the hardness of those sampled from MNS lies in the moderate range (ref. Fig. 3b ). Non-hyperlinks sampled by CNS gives patterns from the \"green\" region marked at the top in Fig. 1b. In summary, there is a whole spectrum of NS algorithms that could sample non-hyperlinks, and we have explored four of them, viz., UNS, SNS, MNS, and CNS.",

But since our main aim is not to compare between HLP algorithms, scores for NS algorithms that give the best performance for a given HLP algorithm has been bold-faced. The first observation we make is that except for CMM [21] , all other HLP algorithms perform their best when compared against a SNS-sampled negative class. CMM, which is supposed to be the current state-of-theart in HLP, performs its best when evaluated against either MNS or CNS based negative sampling. Another striking point that Table 1 reveals is that no dataset has a unanimous best performing HLP algorithm, and instead varies with the NS algorithm. For example, according to SNS, MNS, and CNS, the best algorithm for the tags-math-sx (tms) dataset turns out to be Katz, CN, and BS respectively. One final point we want to make w.r.t. this table is the general trend of reduction in AUC scores as we move from the leftmost block (SNS) to the rightmost one (CNS). The average reduction has been indicated in the table caption, according to which, simple extensions of link prediction such as CN and Katz have the maximum average reduction (of \u223c 44%), and the CMM algorithm, which actually \"learns\" to pick hyperlinks out of a bag of hyperlinks and non-hyperlinks sees an increment of 33% as we go from SNS to CNS sampling.",

We then train one LRC per NS algorithm (with NS performed via the respective algorithm to generate training data) which is subsequently tested on all three cross validation sets. The performance of LRCs in terms of true negative rates is shown in Fig. 5 . An LRC trained using MNS (Fig. 5b) or CNS (Fig. 5c) can easily predict negatives from SNS truly. However, the same is not true for an LRC trained on SNS samples as shown in Fig. 5a . A typical CN score distribution for three different validation sets defined above and positive hyperlinks is shown in Fig. 4c . Cross validation results of LRC models are evident from this distribution as most of the SNS sampled hyperlinks have a low CN score whereas MNS and CNS sampled hyperlinks have CN scores that are comparable with the CN scores positive hyperlinks. Hence, a model trained on MNS or CNS would be able to generalize better than that trained on SNS.",

But hyperlink prediction (HLP) is atypical, in that there exists extreme class imbalance, with the set of non-hyperlinks being the majority class. We set out to analyze four negative sampling (NS) techniques for HLP, viz., Uniform (UNS), Sized (SNS), Motif (MNS), and Clique (CNS) based NS. We analyzed size, edge-density, and a usual predictor score (CN) distribution for candidate hyperlinks extracted via all NS techniques and found that while UNS is completely useless for HLP, SNS makes the negative class follow the same size distribution as the positive class. But MNS and CNS go one step further and focus on matching their edge-density distributions as well, making the HLP problem challenging in nature. While the evaluation of an HLP algorithm on test sets sampled via SNS, MNS, and CNS is found to vary drastically, a specialized cross-validation of HLP via the supervised learning paradigm further shows that only MNS and CNS generalize well for HLP. In essence, we prescribe using either MNS or CNS for sampling non-hyperlinks for HLP, since they learn fair and generalized HLP predictors that would perform as expected in practical scenarios.",
