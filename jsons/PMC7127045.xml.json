However, due to the impossibility to express complex proteins with post-translational modifications in bacteria, animal cells have become a more attractive alternative for industrial purposes (Butler, 2005). Animal cell cultures were developed in the last decade of the 19th century with the first attempts to hold pieces of fabric in plasma or biological fluids for several days or weeks. Since then, Technology of Animal Cell Cultures has achieved great progress, and is currently one of the most successful tools in biotechnology (Kretzmer, 2002).",

An attractive alternative is the use of the expression in the baculovirus/insect cell system described by Smith et al. (1983). This system is widely used as a tool for the production of recombinant proteins that require complex post-translational modifications (Carpentier et al., 2001). Glycosylation, which is the addition of carbohydrates (glycans) to proteins synthesized by animal cells, is one of the examples of post-translational modification. The parameters of cell culture \u2013 such as nutrients, oxygen, toxic metabolites, concentration, pH and temperature \u2013 may have significant effects on the glycan structure distribution in recombinant proteins, and therefore require efficient control (Butler, 2005).",

These two recombinant bacmids, as well as an empty bacmid were used to treat Sf-9 cells infected with a picornavirus. The results showed that the empty bacmid or those expressing the other recombinant proteins were not effective in inhibiting the replication of EMC virus, presenting results similar to those of the control of infected cells and of the untreated cells. On the other hand, when infected cultures were treated with the recombinant antiviral, there was a reduction of about 3 logs in the viral titers in comparison to that of controls. Therefore, when the purified antiviral protein was used, the reduction in virus produced was around 4 logs, showing that the recombinant antiviral protein remained fully active (Table 1\n). We are currently testing the effect of the antiviral purified recombinant protein on enveloped viruses (measles, rubella and herpes simplex). Preliminary data have shown that the purified recombinant protein is able to reduce by at least 4 logs the replication of the rubella virus and by about 6 logs the replication of the herpes simplex virus (data not shown).",

Even though some antiviral drugs are under clinical trials, 50% of them are directed toward the treatment of HIV. Therefore, there is a need for the development of antiviral agents specific for emerging newly-recognized human pathogens (such as SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1) (Delcroix and Riley, 2011). Recently, various studies have reported the antiviral properties in products obtained from arthropods. Popham et al. (2004) have reported significant reduction in the titers of the baculovirus HzSNPV due to the action of an antiviral protein present in the hemolymph of H. virescens larvae. Chernysh et al. (2002) have isolated two peptides, alloferon 1 and 2, from the hemolymph of Calliphora vicina, which control viral infection when added before infection. Olicard et al. (2005) observed that the addition of the hemolymph of Crassostrea gigas to VERO cell cultures inhibits HSV-1. Extracts of crustacean tissues have also shown a broad spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, probably through multiple inhibitors contained in the extracts (Pan et al., 2000). Hultmark et al. (1980) have reported some antimicrobial properties of a protein of 15 kDa isolated from Hyalophora cecropia caterpillars. Alloferon, a 12.65 kDa protein purified from the hemolymph of the fly C. vicina, effectively inhibited the reproduction of influenza A and B viruses by triggering intracellular responses when added before virus infection similar to the interferons of vertebrates (Chernysh et al., 2002). An antiviral peptide of 916 Da, isolated from H. virescens hemolymph, provided protection against virus infection (Ourth, 2004). Recently, our group has purified an antiviral protein of approximately 20 kDa from the hemolymph of L. obliqua; when added to cultures 1 h before infection, this protein was able to inhibit the replication of all viruses tested in the respective study (Greco et al., 2009).",

The obtained bacmids, containing the sequence of a protein with antiviral activity, were used for the expression of this protein in Sf9 cell cultures. As shown, rAVLO was able to block the replication of the encephalomyocarditis virus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that rAVLO kept the antiviral activity of the native protein from the hemolymph. Based on these results, we propose that a protein present in the hemolymph of the caterpillar L. obliqua displays the antiviral activity and plays a putative role in insect immunity. Studies on the activity of the recombinant protein with enveloped virus (rubella virus, herpes simplex virus and measles virus) were performed. In this case, the virus replication was inhibited by about 4 logs for the rubella virus and about 6 logs for the herpes simplex virus (data not shown).",
