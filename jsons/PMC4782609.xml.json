Results from studies using PCR and sequenced-based tests indicate that there is a long list of viruses that can cause upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses (Table I\n),8, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and the clinical manifestations of infections with these different viruses are quite similar. Infections can lead to no symptoms at all, cold symptoms, or lower respiratory syndromes, such as pneumonitis, bronchiolitis, and acute wheezing illnesses. The risk of asthma seems to be most closely associated with the occurrence and frequency of virus-induced wheezing illnesses.7 Other clinical manifestations of acute viral illnesses that are associated with increased risk of asthma include fever and pneumonitis.4\n",

In general, RSV-B infections tend to cause less severe illnesses, but virulence varies considerably with individual strains of RSV, even within the antigenic groups. Most RSV infections cause mild or asymptomatic illnesses; it is estimated that only 9% of infections lead to outpatient clinic visits, and 5% or less of infections lead to hospitalization.34 Even so, RSV infections are the most common cause of bronchiolitis in the first year of life. Risk factors for RSV-induced bronchiolitis include prematurity; comorbid conditions affecting the heart, lungs, or immune system; and age and season of birth.35 The peak age for susceptibility to RSV lower respiratory tract infection is at 2 to 3 months of age after neutralizing antibody acquired transplacentally from the mother has waned.",

First, approximately one third of children with RSV-induced bronchiolitis have recurrent wheezing episodes. In turn, children with recurrent wheezing are at increased risk for subsequent asthma, especially if they have atopic parents or other atopic features.37 Furthermore, in a large Tennessee Medicaid database children who were born approximately 120 days before the peak RSV season were at increased risk for bronchiolitis and had a corresponding increase in the risk for asthma by age 3.5 to 5.5 years.15 Similarly, analysis of RSV-induced bronchiolitis in birth cohort studies indicates a positive association with the risk for asthma but not allergic sensitization.38, 39 Finally, analysis of the Tucson Children's Respiratory cohort through young adulthood revealed an interaction between RSV lower respiratory tract infection in infancy and smoking with respect to asthma. Active smoking was a significant risk factor (relative risk, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3; P = .003) for asthma only in young adults with a history of RSV lower respiratory tract infection during infancy.40\n",

A prospective nonrandomized study of palivizumab administration to preterm infants in Canada and Europe reported found an 80% reduction in the risk of recurrent wheezing from ages 2 to 5 years in nonatopic children but no effect in atopic children.41 In a multicenter study conducted in The Netherlands, healthy preterm infants born at 33 to 35 weeks' gestation were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of palivizumab prophylaxis and were monitored for 1 year to determine effects on recurrent wheeze. Palivizumab treatment led to a 61% relative reduction in total number of wheezing days in the first year of life.17 Similarly, a case-control study of palivizumab in Japanese infants with mild prematurity demonstrated reduced recurrent wheezing in the treated versus untreated groups (6.4% vs 18.9%, P < .001).42 The most recent study evaluated effects of motavizumab on 2127 healthy full-term Navajo infants, an ethnic group at high risk for bronchiolitis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving infants aged 6 months or less, motavizumab reduced by 87% the relative risk of hospital admission for bronchiolitis.43 However, motavizumab did not reduce subsequent rates of medically attended wheezing between the ages of 1 and 3 years (14.9% vs 14.0% in the placebo group).",

This relationship was first recognized in long-term studies of Finnish infants hospitalized for acute wheezing illnesses. Rhinovirus was the predominant virus detected during wheezing illnesses after 5 months of age. When reassessed 5 years later, 60% of children who wheezed with rhinovirus in the first 2 years of life had asthma.62 Similar findings were obtained at subsequent follow-up of these children in adolescence.63 Birth cohort studies have provided definitive evidence of a strong relationship between rhinovirus-induced wheezing and asthma. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study outpatient rhinovirus-induced wheezing illnesses during the first year of life were a significant predictor of recurrent wheezing through age 3 years.8 Furthermore, viral cause of wheezing illnesses differentially affected the risk for subsequent asthma; the risk of asthma was greater for children who wheezed with rhinovirus (odds ratio [OR], 9.8) or children who wheezed with rhinovirus and RSV (OR, 10.0) compared with that in children who wheezed only with RSV (OR, 2.6).7 Similar findings were reported in the Childhood Asthma Study in Perth: early-life infections with rhinovirus or RSV were associated with an increased risk of asthma but only in children who had aeroallergen sensitization by 2 years of age.4 In a study conducted in The Netherlands, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episodes were positively related to asthma risk. This relationship was partially explained by lower lung function in infancy being a risk factor for rhinovirus wheezing.64 Finally, in a collaborative study involving 2 birth cohorts (COAST and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood), the 17q21 genotype strongly influenced both the risk of rhinovirus-induced wheezing and the probability that an infant with rhinovirus-induced wheezing would go on to have asthma.65 Thus there are unresolved questions as to whether rhinovirus-induced illnesses in childhood promote the development of asthma, reveal the presence of pre-existing asthma, or both.",

On one hand, serious bacterial infections accompanying bronchiolitis appear to be rare,70 and a recent meta-analysis found that antibiotics, such as azithromycin or ampicillin, were not efficacious for treatment of bronchiolitis.71 On the other hand, Bacharier et al72 conducted a randomized multicenter clinical trial involving 607 preschool children with a history of recurrent wheezing illnesses who were then treated with azithromycin or placebo at the beginning of respiratory symptoms. Azithromycin treatment reduced the risk of progression to severe lower respiratory illness (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98; P = .04). The mechanism of effect could be related to either the antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activities of macrolide antibiotics. Additional studies are needed to more clearly identify children most likely to respond to azithromycin therapy given the risks of selecting for antibiotic-resistant organisms and the theoretical risks of disturbing the microbiome during infancy.",

Indeed, animal models indicate that gastrointestinal administration of selected bacteria can provide protection against signs of illness after challenge with RSV.74 Furthermore, exposures in urban environments were related to the risk of recurrent wheeze in the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma birth cohort study.75 Dust samples obtained during the first year of life were analyzed for both bacteria and allergen content. Infants with wheezing and atopy by age 3 years were most likely to grow up in homes with reduced exposure to both microbes and specific allergens (cat, mouse, and cockroach).

Indeed, children in the COAST study who were sensitized to aeroallergens and wheezed with rhinovirus during the first 3 years of life had the greatest risk for asthma inception.7 This led to the question of whether viral illnesses in early life lead to allergic sensitization or whether the converse was true. Using a longitudinal multistate Markov model in the COAST study, Jackson et al2 identified a sequential relationship whereby allergic sensitization leads to viral wheezing. This relationship was strongest for rhinovirus-induced wheezing, and there was no evidence that viral wheezing led to sensitization.",

This steroid-resistant pathway has been reported to be upregulated in children with difficult-to-control asthma.82 Interestingly, IL-33 polymorphisms have been linked with intermediate and late-onset wheezing, which are strongly linked to early-life allergic sensitization.83 Another innate epithelial cytokine, IL-25, is also induced by rhinovirus and is likely to accentuate allergic airway inflammation in the context of rhinovirus infections in allergic subjects.84\n",
