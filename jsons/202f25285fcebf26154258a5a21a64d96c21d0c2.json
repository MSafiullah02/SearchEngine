Two of those four cases reportedly had no contact with the hospital or market, suggesting that the infection can remain latent with an extended but infectious incubation period (Rothe et al., 2020) . Dr. Li himself contracted the virus and suffered from severe respiratory distress that eventually took his life. The original cases in Wuhan Central Hospital had sputum, blood, stool, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures sent for diagnostic testing with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and nextgeneration sequencing (Wu et al., 2020) .

Hand sanitizer is an effective alternative if soap and water is not readily available, such as in public places. Next is avoidance of touching the mouth, nose, or eyes to prevent the spread of viral particles to at-risk areas of the body (Fig. 1) . Given that the average person touches their face up to 2000 times per day, guidelines recommend judicious handwashing to prevent self-inoculation (Kwok et al., 2015) . Commonly used household areas should be cleaned and disinfected with 70% alcohol or chloride-containing wipes. This is true for doorknobs, taps, and children's toys that can easily be placed in children's mouths. Avoiding crowded locations, such as amusement parks and hospitals, can help reduce the risk of transmission (Fig. 2) . This is especially true for areas with a high level of tourism, such as airports and cruise ships.",

For caregivers, a surgical mask is required if within 3 to 6 feet of an infected individual (CDC, 2020a (CDC, , 2020b (CDC, , 2020c (CDC, , 2020d . An N-95 respirator should be used if there is a need to be within 3 feet of an infected person or in a room during a procedure such as intubation that can cause aerosolization of the virus (World Health Organization, 2020). Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should selfquarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation (Shen et al., 2020) . Appropriate hospital infrastructure includes negative pressure rooms, planned routes to evaluation areas, and properly staffed facilities with infectious disease and critical care support (American Medical Association, 2020). Individuals suspected of illness are to make contact with the hospital prior to entry into the facility. The designated health care official will then guide the patient to a contained triage area to have a noninduced sputum or nasopharyngeal swab collected for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. This reduces the chance of infecting those already critically ill in the hospital. Similar precautions are performed for suspected measles cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).",
