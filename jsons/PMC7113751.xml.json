The adult animals are the main source of infection for newborn animals, and serological surveys revealed that 50\u2013100% of adult animals have an immune response against RVA (Schlafer and Scott, 1979). Clinically healthy newborn animals may also shed RVA, but the prevalence is lower compared to animals exhibiting diarrhea (Kaminjolo and Adesiyun, 1994). Studies have shown that detection of rotavirus in the presence of diarrhea is a significant finding in calf diarrhea (Cho et al., 2013). Additionally, rotavirus has been shown to be significantly associated with liquid diarrhea in 9- to 21-day-old dairy calves (Al Mawly et al., 2015) and also in beef calves (Cho et al., 2013).",

            "text": "There are many assays used for diagnosis of RVA. Historically, diagnostic laboratories routinely used electron microscopy (EM) for detection of the virus. However, due to the costs of the microscope and its maintenance, as well as the required technical expertise, this method has lost favor. Additionally, EM lacks sensitivity, requiring \u223c106 viral particles/ml for virus detection (Maes et al., 2003). Immunoassays (such as ELISAs) have replaced EM as the diagnostic test of choice for detection of viral antigen because of their ease of use and speed of obtaining a result (Desselberger, 2014). Most of the commercially available ELISA kits are based on monoclonal antibodies against VP6 glycoprotein, which is expressed at a high level during infection. The VP6 glycoprotein is conserved among RVA of different animal species, allowing cross-reactivity and detection of the virus from different hosts. Therefore, the commercially available human RVA ELISA assays have been used for detection of RVA in animals (Bailey et al., 2013). However, as a result of antigenic drift, there are several variants or genotypes of RVA VP6 that have been described (Mino et al., 2015). Differences among these VP6 genotypes influence the performance of various commercially available VP6 based immunoassays. Therefore, diagnostic kit validation for each species is necessary. Not all the assays have been validated for use in all animal species, and this is particularly true for horses (Mino et al., 2015). In fact, one human RVA rapid immunoassay developed for patient-side use was shown not to work in detection of RVA in horses (Slovis et al., 2014).",

RNA copy numbers were calculated and a standard curve was generated from ten-fold serial dilutions of the RNA standard at a range from 1 \u00d7 10\u22121 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22126. The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by calculation of intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV). The assay specificity was evaluated by testing DNA and RNA of different pathogens that are known to cause diarrhea in various animal species, including Neorickettsia risticii (Potomac horse fever), Rhodococcus equi, Clostridium difficile, E. coli, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Dublin, Crytosporidium parvum, bovine viral diarrhea virus genotypes I and II, and bovine coronavirus.",

The lyophilized Premix was rehydrated before reaction in 50 \u03bcl Premix Buffer B and 5 \u03bcl of sample RNA were added to the mixture. The mixture was transferred to an R-tube, centrifuged and tested by the POCKIT\u2122 nucleic acid analyzer (GeneReach USA) as previously described(Wilkes et al., 2014). The assay specificity was evaluated as described for the in-house rtRT-PCR assay. Double-stranded rotavirus NS5 RNA was synthesized and used to determine sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR reagent set. Briefly, a plasmid containing a partial sequence of the NSP5 gene of the RVA/horse-wt/ZAF/EqRV-SA1/2006/G14P[12] strain (GenBank accession JQ345499) and the bovine rotavirus strain KJ44 strain (GenBank accession DQ494399) were used to generate positive and negative strand RNA by in vitro transcription using the MAXIscript\u00ae T7 kit and MEGAscript\u00ae SP6 Kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. Residual DNA was removed using the Ambion\u00ae Turbo DNA-free\u2122 kit (Life Technologies). The two RNA products were annealed to form double-stranded RNA. Residual single strand RNA was removed by RNase A treatment. After phenol-chloroform extraction, integrity of the double-stranded RNA preparation was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Concentration of RNA was determined in a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Houston, TX, USA). Serial dilutions of double-stranded RNA were made in 40 ng/\u03bcl yeast tRNA. Single use aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Additionally, the sensitivity of the rotavirus RT-iiPCR reagent set was evaluated by comparison with the commercially available rtRT-PCR assay using 10-fold serial dilutions of nucleic acid extracted from a positive bovine clinical sample.",

The limitation of antibody-based tests for the detection of enteric pathogens is the requirement of high concentration of free antigen to generate a positive reaction, the free antigen is decreased significantly during the course of disease. Therefore, these tests have lower sensitivity and could miss positive samples collected late in the course of clinical disease, when compared to RT-PCR (Izzo et al., 2012, Maes et al., 2003).

Interestingly, three positive samples by ELISA in this study were negative by EM and all three molecular assays. The ELISA assay absorbance values for these samples ranged from 0.2 to 0.5, which indicates low viral load according to the manufacturer. These samples were considered false positives. False positive results are not uncommon for ELISA assays as a result of the complex sample matrix (i.e. gut microbiota), which can increase the probability of cross-reactions. The type of antibodies (polyclonal versus monoclonal) used strongly affects their detection efficiency.

            "text": "Related to this concept is the idea that magnitude of viral shedding (based on Ct value) can help determine disease etiology (Phillips et al., 2009). Evidence of high viral load in samples tested gives the clinician more confidence that the virus is the cause of the disease process (Izzo et al., 2012). A high correlation between Ct values \u226425 and clinical disease was found in one human study that compared RVA shedding in clinically healthy subjects versus those with diarrhea (Phillips et al., 2009). We found a higher correlation between test methods when we evaluated samples with Ct values \u226425. However, Ct values from different protocols must be interpreted with care because the values may not equate to the same viral load per gram of feces (Phillips et al., 2009). This was actually seen in this study when comparing between the commercial rtRT-PCR assay and the in-house rtRT-PCR assay, particularly with the positive equine samples. The Ct values obtained by the in-house rtRT-PCR assay were 21 and 18.3, compared to 26.18 and 36.01, respectively, by the commercial rtRT-PCR kit. While we did not have additional equine samples to further examine this, these high Ct values from equine samples are consistent with a previous report (Matthijnssens et al., 2015) in which the same commercial molecular assay was also used for diarrheic samples from equine. Ct values for positive samples from that study ranged from 26.18\u201336.01. The authors attributed the high Ct values to degradation of the viral RNA in the samples or mild infection. While these are certainly possibilities, these results do raise questions about the sensitivity of this commercial rtRT-PCR assay in the diagnosis of equine RVA. This disparity may potentially be attributed to mismatches in primer and probe binding areas. The designed primers and probe of the in-house rtRT-PCR assay contain several degenerate bases, in an attempt to avoid problems with base mismatches. However, as seen with the sensitivity testing and comparison between the assays, the in-house molecular test was less sensitive that the other molecular assays. Based on the findings in this study when comparing Ct values, it is important to note that the possibility of the significance of lower concentrations of RNA may not be excluded. Ct values can be affected by many factors, not just mismatches in primer/probe binding regions or inappropriate handling and storage of the sample, but also stage of the disease and the quality of the sample collected (Izzo et al., 2012).",

While it is possible some of the positive samples could have been false positives, we believe it is more likely associated with the increased sensitivity seen with this test, which was demonstrated with side-by-side testing, versus the commercial rtRT-PCR assay, of serial dilutions of nucleic acid from a clinical sample. High sensitivity of RT-iiPCR assays has been consistently demonstrated in previous reports (Ambagala et al., 2015, Balasuriya et al., 2014, Wilkes et al., 2014). The higher sensitivity may be attributed to the performance of the reaction in gradient temperature that results from the thermal convective phenomena associated with this type of PCR (Krishnan et al., 2002). This allows primers and probes to anneal to sequences with mismatches (Ambagala et al., 2015).",

However, rather than obtaining a Ct value that requires interpretation, the portable machine detects the fluorescent signal before and after the reaction and automatically converts it into a positive or negative result. The numerical value for these fluorescent signals can be obtained from the machine for some determination about amount of virus present in the sample, but the sensitivity of the signal does not correlate as well as a threshold cycle value does for real-time PCR. The automated interpretation of the iiPCR machine does however make the method easier to use without the need for advanced training. The portable machine is small and light weight and can be operated with a car battery.",
