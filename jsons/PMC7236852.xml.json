Preliminary unpublished evidence suggests that COVID-19-positive patients are at increased risk of acute ischemic stroke. A recent report from China suggests that neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, headache, hypogeusia, and hyposma, are common (36%) in patients with COVID-19.8 Encephalopathy and altered mental status have also been reported in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.9 Cerebrovascular disease is more common in severe COVID-19 disease; acute ischemic stroke has been reported in 5.7% and impaired consciousness in 15% of patients with severe disease.8 These results are consistent with another report of 221 patients from Wuhan, China, which found a 5% incidence of acute ischemic stroke and a 1% incidence of cerebral hemorrhage.10 In this cohort, patients with cerebrovascular complications were more likely to be older, have severe COVID-19 disease, and demonstrate evidence of hypercoagulability and inflammation. Ultimately, 38% of patients with cerebrovascular complications died. Together, these preliminary reports suggest that patients with COVID-19 could present more frequently for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke and could also be at elevated risk of perioperative stroke if they require surgery during acute infection.",

The SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viruses are closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in structure and infection pathway, and both have been shown to infect the central nervous system (CNS) in animal models; the brainstem was found to be heavily infected by both SARS-CoV11 and MERS-CoV.12 Furthermore, CNS infection was closely related to high mortality rate, possibly due to dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory center in the brainstem. A predisposition to neuroinvasion is considered to be a common feature of the coronavirus family, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be presumed to have similar features.13 The alterations in smell observed with COVID-19, in particular, have been postulated to reflect the access of the virus to the brain through the transcribrial route as described in other pathogens14; although this remains to be proven for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, direct invasion of the CNS is plausible, and may account for some of the neurological symptoms reported by COVID-19-positive patients.13",

The accepted criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19 include 1 of the following: (1) RT-qPCR positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid; (2) the viral gene identified by gene sequencing is highly homologous with known COVID-19; or (3) presence of COVID-19-specified IgM and IgG antibodies.",

Ideally, induction of anesthesia and intubation should be performed by an experienced provider in a negative-pressure environment, and intubation performed using rapid sequence induction with videolaryngoscopy while minimizing bag-mask ventilation. Extubation following general anesthesia should, if possible, also be performed in a negative-pressure environment using airborne PPE. Coughing should be avoided during extubation. The patient should wear a surgical mask after extubation and high flow oxygen (ie, <6 L/min) avoided given the risk of aerosolization.28 Finally, patient transportation also requires attention to safety and minimization of contamination. Extubated patients should receive oxygen via face mask and, if possible, an additional surgical mask placed on the patient underneath.24",

As such, the minimum number of essential staff should be in the operating room and use appropriate PPE (Fig. 1).

Whatever technique is chosen, during the COVID-19 pandemic coughing during awake craniotomy should be avoided to minimize the potential for contamination and aerosolization. This can be mitigated through the use of intravenous medications such as low dose lidocaine or remifentanil.41,42 In addition, we advocate an approach that avoids airway instrumentation and uses only light sedation (ie, drowsy but arousable) before neurocognitive testing. Urgent airway intervention, including nasal airway insertion, is particularly detrimental during this pandemic. In addition, regional scalp blocks and/or local anesthetic infiltration are essential to provide analgesia and minimize sedation requirements. Given that individuals can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-19 and remain asymptomatic,43 patients should wear a surgical mask whenever possible, including during the procedure; the mask can be temporarily removed during neurocognitive testing. Supplemental oxygen (ie, face mask) can be placed over the surgical mask if needed.

These symptoms often last as long as 30 months after recovery from SARS, including in health care providers who were infected and recovered.48,49 Even healthy health care providers who were not infected experienced substantial psychological distress years after the outbreak.50 At the time of writing (April 2020), the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is at least 2 orders greater than that of SARS and a recent survey suggests that health care providers taking care of COVID-19 patients in China report high rates of distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.51",

If asymptomatic, patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 but remain asymptomatic should be allowed to proceed only if subsequent testing 14 days later is negative, and ECT is considered a life-saving procedure.",

The most challenging aspect of anesthesia for ECT during the pandemic is airway management. The commonly used technique of bag-mask ventilation and hyperventilation without an airway device represents significant risk of infection for health care providers, including anesthesiologists.55 To minimize risk of viral transmission, the following are recommended:Since anesthesia management for ECT inevitably involves positive-pressure bag-mask ventilation with an unprotected airway, it should ideally be performed in a negative-pressure single airborne suite, utilizing full PPE, restricted personnel, and careful disinfection (eg, minimum 75% alcohol52) of the suite, allowing at least 30 minutes between patients55,56 depending on institutional air exchange rate;To minimize hypersalivation, glycopyrrolate 0.2 to 0.4 mg intravenously can be safely administered before induction of anesthesia57;To reduce coughing on emergence, remifentanil can be safely administered during the procedure and lidocaine (1 to 1.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight) can be administered intravenously after the seizure is completed55,56;Although hyperventilation using bag-mask ventilation can improve seizure quality, the evidence for this is weak58 and aerosolization is increased. Therefore, this strategy should be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic unless adjustment to other measures to improve seizure quality is unsuccessful. Induction agents providing best possible quality of seizure should be employed; these include ketamine, etomidate, and methohexital59;Patients should be carefully preoxygenated before induction of anesthesia when bag-mask ventilation is minimized; consider apneic oxygenation with nasal prongs55;In cases requiring hyperventilation, a laryngeal mask airway allowing capnography55 should be considered as an alternative to manual bag-mask ventilation;Patients should be recovered in designated areas wearing surgical masks.52,55",

In addition to the risks that general anesthesiologists face in becoming infected with the virus, including during airway management, neuroanesthesiologists have additional exposure risk due to their close proximity to patients and long surgical procedures. Wearing PPE for a prolonged time may cause excessive heat, pressure sores, and a need for frequent rehydration; neurointerventional procedures may be particularly uncomfortable due to the addition of lead protection under the PPE. It is essential that all steps of doffing should be thoroughly completed and meticulous hand washing performed before any consumption, and that all food or drink is consumed outside of any patient care area. Owing to these practice restrictions, neuroanesthesiology departments should ensure additional staffing is available to provide breaks and clinical support during cases.",
