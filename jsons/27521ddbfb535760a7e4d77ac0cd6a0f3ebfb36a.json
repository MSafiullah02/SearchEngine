We will focus on strategies adopted by the government and also the Orthopaedic community of the two countries up till the beginning of April 2020. We hope that by sharing of relevant information and knowledge on how we are managing the COVID-19 condition, we can help other communities, and health care workers to more effectively overcome this pandemic.",

This novel virus (SARS-nCoV) was later re-named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-Cov-2), and the genomic sequence was published on 7th January 2020. With the development of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kit to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, confirmation of the disease (COVID-19) can be made 2 . Within the following weeks, new cases were detected in Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, and their epidemiological patterns started to indicate that human to human transmission is possible 3, 4 . Considering the mortality and morbidity risk of the national population, the Chinese government decided to implement lockdown of the province of Hubei on 23rd January 2020, one day before the Spring festival celebration where millions of people were expected to travel across the whole country 5 . On 30th January 2020, with new confirmed cases in United States, Europe, Middle East and Australia, WHO declared the condition to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) 6 . By means of early confirmation of new cases, stringent contact tracing, social distancing and travel restrictions, the number of new COVID 19 cases seems to have plateaued in South Korea and Japan, and even reduced in China in the month of March. However, with more than 110,000 cases from 114 countries reported globally, WHO declared the status of pandemic on 11th March 2020 7 .",

The index imported COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Singapore on 23rd January 2020. Highly pro-active measures were immediately taken in a coordinated multiministry taskforce set up by the Singapore government in close cooperation with the country's healthcare services to try to contain the impact of the epidemic 9 . In spite of this, spikes were still observed which can be broadly described as 1) imported cases from mainland China, 2) local clusters, and 3) imported cases from returnees from other parts of the world (Fig. 1) 10 . In spite of a rigorous protocol for contact tracing, there remains a slight uptick in unlinked cases diagnosed locally 11, 12 .",

A second cluster of cases that was associated with a religious gathering in Petaling Jaya emerged in early March 14 . On 16th March, the Prime Minister announced two-week period of Movement Controlled Order (MCO) that involved closing of international borders, shutdown of non-essential businesses, prohibition of traveling and public gatherings 15 . However, confirmed number of cases surged to more than 2000 in the month of March (Fig. 2) 10 , and roughly half of the cases were associated with the second cluster 15 .

Each team had sufficient expertise to handle complex cases that required specific skillsets. The spine team focused on operating on patients that required urgent decompression or restoration of spine stability. The trauma OTs and spine OT ran during office hours.
