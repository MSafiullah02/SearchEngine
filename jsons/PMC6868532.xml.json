The combustion of these fuels produces a complex mixture of air pollutants collectively termed household air pollution (HAP). These air pollutants contributed to 59 million disability-adjusted life years and 1.6 million premature deaths worldwide in 2017 (IMHE, 2017). Of the diseases HAP contributes to, pneumonia has the largest impact on children (Gordon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014). Pneumonia is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide for children under five years of age (Stanaway et al., 2018), and almost half of that mortality is in Sub-Saharan Africa (Troeger et al., 2017). In Ghana, where our study is based, pneumonia is the second leading cause of death for children under five, and caused over 6000 childhood deaths in 2016 (Troeger et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2018).",

A number of HAP-specific studies have found such an association (Dherani et al., 2008; Smith, 2000). However, evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) has been inconsistent with observational studies (Mortimer et al., 2017). Intention-to-treat results for RESPIRE in Guatemala yielded inconclusive results for pneumonia, but severe pneumonia showed significant results. Exposure-response analyses in RESPIRE, however, did find a significant relationship with pneumonia (Smith et al., 2011). A small subset of air pollution studies has specifically investigated the etiology of HAP-associated pneumonia. The RESPIRE study, for example, found a decrease in severe respiratory syncytial virus negative (RSV-) pneumonia with lower levels of HAP exposure, but no impact on severe RSV+ infections. Other studies suggest that air pollution exposure may increase susceptibility to bacterial pneumonias, but not viral pneumonias (Rylance et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2011; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007).",

Development and uptake of the pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines have changed the distribution of attributable fractions of pneumonia by microbe, with higher viral proportions in vaccinated populations (Barson et al., 2014). Ghana has been particularly successful in its national childhood vaccination efforts, especially in rural areas (Asuman et al., 2018). In our Ghana cohort, we have found that 91.4% of our rural participants received the three scheduled pneumococcal vaccines by the child's first birthday.

Fieldworkers referred suspected cases to a study clinic for clinician diagnosis and treatment. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for all clinician-diagnosed cases. Fieldworkers then identified healthy infant controls, who were also sent for nasopharyngeal swabs. The fieldworkers chose healthy controls that were the same sex and close to the same age as the case, prioritizing those living in the same (or a neighboring) community. A total of 669 unique samples were catalogued and stored for future analysis. Samples were stored in a \u2212 80 \u00b0C freezer until microbial profiling, except for transport to the Unites States when on dry ice. With resources to analyze 290 samples, a computer-generated random selection of swabs selected 145 pneumonia cases, and their matched controls, for PCR analysis (Fig. 1\n). Swabs were only selected from the LPG and 3-stone arms of the study to maximize the exposure contrast among samples. We determined that fieldworker selection of controls did not achieve sufficient balance on matching variables, so a \u201cnearest neighbor\u201d algorithm was used to perform a 1:1 match of each pneumonia case with its nearest control. The nearest neighbor algorithm finds the closest possible match between participants in the dataset based on chosen covariates, in our case, minimizing the difference between age and sex. We then removed all repeat pneumonia cases (swabs from reoccurring pneumonias), with their associated healthy controls, to preserve independence and given prior literature on altered microbiomal development with prior infection (Bosch et al., 2017). Our final sample consisted of 130 pneumonia cases and 130 healthy controls for our intention-to-treat analysis.",

The monitor measured CO every 10 s in parts per million. It was attached to the participants' clothing, close to the breathing zone, except during sleep or bathing, when participants were asked to keep the monitor off the ground and nearby. Fieldworkers visited daily to ensure wearing compliance and proper device functioning. Devices were checked against certified span gas every six weeks, and a data validation system addressed low-quality deployments. Final session values were based on a 48-h measurement period. See Quinn et al. (2016) for additional information. Two separate exposure variables were used to assess effects based on timing of exposure. First, a prenatal maternal exposure average was calculated using the data from the four prenatal sessions, herein referred to as the Mean Prenatal CO. Second, for the postnatal session, children's exposures were linearly interpolated between time points to provide regular estimates over time. The interpolation estimates the most recent CO value at the time of the nasopharyngeal swab, herein referred to as Recent Postnatal CO. We report R2 and intraclass correlation coefficients for CO measurements, for the entire GRAPHS cohort, by arm of the study and by individual repeated measures (Supplementary Table 2). These are provided to aid in the interpretation of results based on the exposure variables.

A 100-meter radial buffer was created around each home to aggregate the number of individuals within 100 m of the reference household using a spatial join. The season of swab was based on the date of an infant's swab, comparing the Harmattan/dry season to the non-Harmattan/wet season. Ultimately, we found that the season of swab was the only potential confounder variable correlated with the exposure and the outcome, identified via univariable regressions with p-values < 0.05.

Using MassTag PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs, we identified ten viruses and three bacteria present among our study participants. In an intention-to-treat analysis, we observed lower bacterial species presence among participants in the LPG study arm compared to the 3-stone fire study arm. This observation persisted among all three of the bacterial species analyzed. The difference was pronounced for pneumonia cases, and attenuated for healthy controls. We did not observe a difference in viral species presence between the LPG and 3-stone study arms. This finding is interesting given that colonization or infection of the upper airways is one of the first steps of pneumonia etiology (Bogaert et al., 2004). Other studies have shown that HAP is associated with increased bacterial abundance in the lower airways (Rylance et al., 2015) and impaired phagocytic response in the lower airways (Rylance et al., 2015; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007). Therefore, HAP may be operating on multiple parts of the pneumonia disease pathway.",

With regard to exposure, CO was the only consistently monitored air pollutant. When designing the study, we intended to use CO as a proxy for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Since then, studies have demonstrated that CO may not be an appropriate proxy (Carter et al., 2017; Klasen et al., 2015). PM2.5 was monitored in this trial, but due to the considerable cost of PM2.5 exposure monitoring relative to CO, it was only monitored on a subset of participants in fewer monitoring sessions. We investigated using PM exposures in the current analysis, but there was insufficient overlap between swabbed participants and those tracked for PM2.5 in order to conduct exposure-response analyses. Of the overlap we did have, there was a low, but significant, correlation between PM and CO.

These high background levels mean that our study may not have been appropriately powered to detect differences in bacterial species abundance. Further, MassTag PCR, while a powerful tool, provides coarse measures of microbial diversity. Results from the MassTag PCR can only provide a binary outcome on a fixed library of microbes. Presence of a microbe at one time point may not provide adequate information to infer causal mechanisms; instead, it is preferred to confirm microbial presence over time as well as density of colonization. Finally, our analysis utilizes samples from the nasal epithelium whereas pneumonia occurs in the lower respiratory tract. However, growing evidence demonstrates the strong relationships between the composition of the upper respiratory tract and overall respiratory health (Biesbroek et al., 2014; Man et al., 2017; Teo et al., 2015).",

This is an important area of investigation given the vast burden of disease caused by HAP, specifically on young children.
