Coronavirus disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death. Many efforts have been made to identify risk factors predisposing to a severe issue. In the first SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002, hypertension was noted in 9/19 patients who died from SARS-CoV in Toronto (1) . In the two largest cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 published, hypertension is the most common comorbidity in patients with severe disease or in those who died or were ventilated (2, 3) . Nevertheless, these data are not adjusted for age, although age appears to be a strong predictor of adverse outcome (4) and hypertension is a very common finding in older patients. Finally, cohort studies only show correlation, not causality. In this paper, we hypothesize that the reductions in Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) observed in hypertension and obesity can explain many abnormalities observed in SARS-CoV-2 and question the role of treatments interfering with ACE2.",

            "text": "ACE-2 is a monocarboxypeptidase homologous to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) whose active site is exposed at the extracellular surface (8, 11) . ACE cleaves angiotensin I (ANGI) to generate angiotensin II (ANGII), which binds to and activates Angiotensin Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) to constrict blood vessels and increase salt and fluid retention, thereby elevating blood pressure. ACE2 inactivates ANGII by converting it to angiotensin-(1-7), which has a vasodilator effect when binding to Mas receptor (12) (Figure 1A) . Moreover, ACE2 cleaves ANGI into angiotensin-(1-9) (albeit with lower affinity than for ANGII), which is further converted into angiotensin-(1-7) by ACE (12) . Thus, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system and modulates the vasoconstriction, fibrosis, and hypertrophy induced by that system (8, 11) . In rats, ACE2 deficiency worsens hypertension when ANGII is in excess (8, 13) . In human, gene expression and/or ACE2 activity is lower in hypertensive patients than in normotensive ones (13) . FIGURE 1 | (A) ANGII binding to AT1R elevates blood pressure and promotes inflammation. ACE2 inactivates ANGII by converting it to ang-(1-7) and negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system, promoting vasodilatation and hypotension. (B) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 leads to their internalization and to ACE2 shedding by ADAM17 (enzyme not shown). Lower availability of ACE2 results in a lower rate of ANGII degradation and excessive stimulation of AT1R, which facilitates ARDS and myocardial injury. Binding of ANGII to AT1R leads to membranous ACE2 internalization, decreasing ACE2 availability even more (not shown). Excessive ANGII is metabolized to ANGIV, which binds to AT4R and promotes thrombosis. Virus replication could also reduce cellular ACE2 expression (not shown). (C) SARS-CoV-2 infection and ACEi/ARB treatment. ACEi and ARB upregulate ACE2, and freer ACE2 remains after viral binding. ANGII is still degraded by ACE2 in its beneficial metabolite Ang-(1-7), and AT1R and AT4R are less stimulated. ANGII binding on AT1R prevention with ARB and ANGII synthesis decrease with ACE lead to less AT1R stimulation and persistent interaction with ACE2, avoiding ACE2 internalization.

Nevertheless, in the absence of excess ANGII (either by reduction of ANGII synthesis by ACEi or by AT1R blockade thanks to ARB), AT1R is thought to interact with ACE2 (11) .

An increased abundance of cellular ACE2 is associated with a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection in mice (23) . However, in both heart and lung, binding of the SARS-CoV to ACE2 leads to the loss of ACE2 by ACE2 internalization with the virus and ACE2 shedding (7, 9, 14) . Lower availability of ACE2 results in a lower rate of ANGII degradation. In rodent lungs, excess ANGII binding to AT1R increases pulmonary vascular permeability and neutrophil accumulation and enhances lung injury (7, 24) (Figure 1B) . Thus, decreased ACE2 expression promotes increased lung injury and ARB prevents it by limiting ANGII binding to AT1R (7, 8, 24, 25) (Figure 1C) . This hypothesis is supported in vivo by the increased frequency of severe ARDS in patients infected with SARS-CoV with higher levels of ACE determined by genetic predisposition, leading to higher levels of ANGII (26) , and by the correlation between viral load, ANGII plasma level, and disease severity in influenza H7N5 (27) and respiratory syncytial virus infection (25) . More notably, in a small cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral load was correlated with plasma ANGII level (28) . Unfortunately, baseline treatments are unknown in this cohort, and correlation between ARDS severity and plasma ANGII level failed to reach statistical significance, maybe because of the low number of patients.",

As in lungs, ANGII probably contributes to the deleterious effect of SARS-CoV on the heart and to SARS-associated cardiomyopathy, even if myocardial dysfunction can also be influenced by the strong immune response observed in those patients (9) . Inflammatory signals are likely to suppress ACE2 transcription and down-regulate cell-surface expression of ACE2 (8) . Thus, inflammatory signals could decrease the cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection but increase the ANGII-mediated tissular injury. Moreover, because pericytes are supposed to play a role in myocardial microcirculation, SARS-CoV-2induced microcirculation disorder could explain the frequent cardiac marker increase observed in hospitalized patients (2) , exacerbated by the reduced oxygen supply caused by lung failure (10) .",

This latter condition is the one provoked by ACEi/ARB treatment. On the one hand, ACE2 increase under ARB/ACEi treatment could be protective during COVID-19 because some ACE2 remains free to degrade ANGII, but on the other hand, this ACE2 increase could be deleterious by favoring cellular infection by COVID-19, leading to potent myocarditis ( Figure 1C) .

Furthermore, treatment with ARB inhibits AT1R and limits the damage induced by its overstimulation. It is not clear whether continuation or discontinuation of ARB or ACEi is a good option in COVID-19 infection, as there is a lack of clinical data to support an increased risk of contracting a severe form of COVID-19. In addition, we do not even know whether renin angiotensin system inhibitor therapy is beneficial or harmful for virally mediated lesions, and switching to other drugs may worsen the patient's condition, especially for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (42) . Clinical trials are ongoing to analyze the beneficial effect of LOSARTAN in COVID-19 (NCT04311177 and NCT04312009), and a trial will start soon to analyze the consequences of discontinuation or continuation of ACEi/ARB (NCT04338009).",

Beta blockers suppress plasma angiotensin II levels by inhibiting prorenin processing to renin and probably do not interfere with ACE or ACE2 (43) . Calcium channel blockers seem to reduce ANGII-induced downregulation of ACE2, but data are limited to those presented in one paper on the effect of nifedipine on fractionated cell extracts (44) . In hypertensive rats, neither thiazides nor mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve the spontaneous low ACE2 activity (18, 45) , but MRA could decrease ACE expression (18) . Conversely, MRAs increase membranous ACE2 activity in patients (46) with heart failure. If the reduction of membranous ACE2 observed in hypertension and obesity plays an important role in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, can it be hypothesized that non-ACEi/BRA drugs (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics) are more likely to increase the risk of deleterious outcomes than ACEi/BRA drugs that increase ACE2 and provide theoretical protection? Data on baseline treatments are urgently needed but are lacking to date in published cohorts.",
