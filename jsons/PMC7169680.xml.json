            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) was initially recognized in the UK in 1971 and is caused by infection with a coronavirus (PED virus), a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus. The disease is characterized by diarrhoea and vomiting leading to severe dehydration with high mortality among young piglets and hence severe economic losses. During the 1980s and 1990s, the disease spread within Europe and also to Asia and caused significant problems (reviewed in Jung and Saif, 2015). A new wave of PED virus (PEDV) infections occurred from 2010 onwards in China and adjacent countries (Sun et al., 2012) and the virus appeared for the first time in the USA in 2013 (Chen et al., 2014). Retrospectively, it has been shown that two closely related variants of PEDV, termed \u2018INDEL\u2019 and \u2018non\u2010INDEL\u2019 that reflect the presence or absence of specific insertions and deletions within the S\u2010gene sequence, were introduced into the United States at that time (Huang et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Recently, new cases of PED have occurred within several countries in Europe and the circulating viruses are genetically similar to the \u2018INDEL\u2019 strains found in the USA and China (Hanke et al., 2015); these viruses have been suggested to cause less severe disease than the \u2018non\u2010INDEL\u2019 strains (Wang et al., 2014) and this has been supported by recent experimental studies (Yamamoto et al., 2015). However, it is apparent that the nature and severity of the disease can vary significantly even with apparently very similar virus strains and thus, other factors must also determine the outcome of the infection. These can include the age, immune status and general health status (EFSA (European Food Standards Agency), AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), 2014). Sequence analysis of the recent PED viruses circulating in the United States, China and Europe has been reported (Chen et al., 2014; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Hanke et al., 2015). Some initial animal studies using the recent PEDV strains to determine the characteristics of the infection have been performed (Jung et al., 2014; Madson et al., 2014; Crawford et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2015) and also previously animal experiments with an early European strain have been described (Debouck et al., 1981). The experiments described here extend these studies and also demonstrate the efficacy of current diagnostic systems to detect and monitor infections by distinct PEDVs viruses.",

The pigs were inoculated (orally), on post\u2010infection day (PID) 0, with a virus suspension (2 mls) within secure biocontainment facilities. Group 1 received the Vero cell culture\u2010grown European isolate of PEDV Br1/87 (very closely related to the prototypic CV777 strain (Bridgen et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2014)) that was obtained from the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, U.K., in 1987. It was subsequently passaged three times in Vero cells in the presence of trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml); the virus stock used in these studies had a titre of 106.8 TCID/ml, as measured by immune staining of infected Vero cells. Group 2 was inoculated with a suspension derived from a sample of faeces that was homogenized (10% w/v suspension) and clarified by centrifugation. The sample originated from a PEDV\u2010infected pig that was submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for routine examination and was kindly supplied by Sandra Blome (Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany). Pigs in Group 3 were inoculated with a 10% (w/v) clarified homogenate of intestine and faeces from a pig in Iowa infected with PEDV (a \u2018non\u2010INDEL\u2019 strain); this material was kindly provided by APHIS, Ames, IA, USA. The \u2018non\u2010INDEL\u2019 status was verified by sequencing the S gene (data not shown). Each inoculum contained high levels of PEDV RNA as determined using a modified real\u2010time RT\u2010qPCR assay. Briefly, RNA was extracted from samples using a Magna Pure LC robot with a Magna Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid kit (Roche) and eluted in nuclease\u2010free water (50 \u03bcl). RT\u2010qPCR assays used a one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR kit (Qiagen) with the primers and probe described by Kim et al. (2007) together with the primers and probe described by Chen et al. (2014) (note: the reverse primers are identical in each primer set and both probes were labelled with the same fluorophores). The assays were run for 40 cycles.",

A third pig from Group 3 was also euthanized at the same time for welfare reasons due to accidental injury and lameness unrelated to the PED infection. Tissue samples were collected separately, at necropsy, from the jejunum, ileum and colon of each pig. In addition, samples from the liver, lung and spleen of each pigs were collected and stored frozen (\u221280\u00b0C) until analysed further (see below). The surviving pigs were maintained until PID 28, and blood samples were collected on pre\u2010selected days (PID 0, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28). The presence of anti\u2010PEDV antibodies in the sera was determined using an in\u2010house blocking ELISA (analogous to that used for PRRSV (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997) using cell culture\u2010grown PEDV (Br1/87) as antigen and a biotin\u2010conjugated pig anti\u2010PEDV polyclonal antibody (B. Strandbygaard and A. B\u00f8tner, unpublished data). The bound biotinylated antibody was detected using avidin\u2010conjugated horseradish peroxidase (eBioscience) plus 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032\u2010tetramethylbenzidine substrate and the OD measured at 450/630 nm.

In contrast, unfortunately, no apparent infection was achieved within Group 2 using an inoculum derived from a faecal sample from a recent case of PED in Germany despite the presence of high levels of PEDV RNA in this sample. No information on the collection and storage conditions of the faecal sample prior to submission to the diagnostic laboratory is available, and various factors may have been deleterious for the infectivity of the PEDV in the sample. It should be noted that the US PEDV sample was a homogenate of intestine, as well as faecal material, and this difference compared with the German sample may, or may not, be significant for its ability to cause infection.",

The relative level of infectivity within the different samples used as inoculum is not known as attempts to isolate PEDV in cell culture from the supplied faecal/intestinal samples were not successful (data not shown). However, it is clear that sufficient virus was present in the cell culture\u2010grown Br1/87 isolate and in the US PEDV sample to cause infection in all of the inoculated animals. These infections were demonstrated by a variety of means including the appearance of fairly mild clinical disease, the presence of high levels of PEDV RNA in the intestine (at PID 4) or the prolonged excretion of PEDV RNA and the induction of anti\u2010PEDV antibodies within 10 days post\u2010inoculation.

The presence of PEDV RNA in serum from acutely infected pigs has been reported previously (Jung et al., 2014, 2015). A consistent observation is that the viral RNA was found at a very much lower level in serum than in faecal material and the RNA that is present in serum has not yet been shown to be within infectious virus.",

PEDV RNA was also detected in the spleens of some of these pigs (even in the absence of virus RNA in the serum) and the level of viral RNA in the spleen was higher than in liver or lungs. Thus, it does not seem possible to account for the level of viral RNA within the spleen by the presence of virus in the blood. In earlier studies, PEDV antigens were not detected by immunostaining within the spleen, liver or lungs of CV777\u2010infected pigs (Debouck et al., 1981) or in lungs of PEDV PC21A\u2010infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014), but the sensitivity of the RT\u2010qPCR assays used here is likely higher than the sensitivity of the immunostaining procedures. It has been reported (Park and Shin, 2014) that PEDV can replicate in pulmonary macrophages in vivo and thus extra\u2010intestinal replication of PEDV seems possible (Jung and Saif, 2015). The results presented here indicate that the US PEDV produced slightly more severe clinical signs than the cell culture\u2010grown Br1/87 strain. Furthermore, the duration and extent of virus excretion together with the presence of viremia were all more marked in the US PEDV inoculated Group. However, these differences may be due to use of the cell culture\u2010grown virus (potentially adapted) compared with the field virus or possible differences in the level of infectious virus used for the inoculation rather than a real difference in properties of the strains.",

The mild clinical outcome observed in this study may be related to the age of piglets used. Newborn piglets appear most severely affected by the infection in the field, and hence, experimental infection of such piglets can be expected to produce a more severe disease and even mortality. Indeed, the outcome of PEDV infections in pigs appears to be dependent upon a range of factors (see EFSA, AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), 2014). Potential differences in the pathogenicity of different strains of the virus require side\u2010by\u2010side comparisons with defined virus isolates under carefully defined conditions.",
