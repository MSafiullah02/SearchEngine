Forrestel Overview \u2022 Infection with encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans or gattii -C. neoformans is found in bird and bat droppings and contaminated soil/dust; C. gattii colonizes trees/wood debris \u2022 Infection typically occurs following inhalation leading to variable pulmonary manifestations (ranging from asymptomatic mild pneumonitis to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) -The majority of cases will remain contained within the lungs -Reactivation can occur when immunosuppression prevents continued proper containment of a latent infection \u2022 Cutaneous lesions almost always result from embolic hematogenous spread in disseminated disease -Approximately 10% of cryptococcal infections will become disseminated, typically occurring in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, organ transplant, chronic steroid use); dissemination rates may reach up to 50% in AIDS patients, often occurring when CD4 counts are below 50-100/\u03bcL -In patients with disseminated disease, hematogenous spread leads to CNS (70-90%) and skin (10-15%) involvement most commonly \u2022 Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis is very rare following direct innoculation; skin involvement should lead one to suspect and evaluate for systemic disease in all cases",

(b) Umbilicated papules on the face. (c) Cobblestoned plaque on the shoulder of a patient with disseminated Cryptococcus. (d) Cryptococcus is a rare cause of atypical recalcitrant cellulitis. This tends to be a deeper red-brown with indurated skin, as shown here in a heart transplant recipient who developed cryptococcal cellulitis with disseminated infection. Cryptococcus (2.5\u00d7, 20\u00d7; H&E 40\u00d7; Grocott): (a) Acute and chronic inflammation with neutrophils and histiocytes is characteristic. Some forms may have fewer organisms and more granulomatous inflammation, whereas infections in immunosuppressed hosts may have abundant organisms and appear more mucinous due to the organisms' capsules. (b) On higher power, there are small spores with surrounding gelatinous walls. (c) Grocott highlights organisms.",
