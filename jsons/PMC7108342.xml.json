There are extensive reports on the exposures and health impacts of various indoor air pollutants [2], [3], [4], [5]. Studies have shown that human exposures to indoor pollutants that exceed outdoor level by 2\u20135 times are not uncommon and in some situation, indoor pollution level can reach 100 times that of the outdoor [6]. A single exposure to high level indoor air pollution can cause headache and nausea, skin and eye irritations, respiratory difficulty, fatigue and even death for the case of carbon monoxide [6], while chronic exposure to indoor pollutants such as radon, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), VOCs, particulates and bioaerosols can result in asthma, cancer, developmental defects and delays in children and weakening of the cardiovascular system in the elderly [7]. Thus, poor indoor air quality poses a greater risk to pregnant women, young children and elderly person.",

An improvement of indoor air quality in the United States of America is expected to save between US$ 7 and US$ 75 billion from lower health cost and absenteeism [9]. Even in the sparsely populated Australia, poor indoor air pollution is reported to cost AUD$ 12 billion annually [10]. Hong Kong, like most Asian cities is densely populated with more than 7 million people living on less than 1100 km2 of land. The narrow roads and tall, high-rise buildings trap pollution resulting in poor air quality. This directly affects the indoor air quality, which is far more complex and dynamics due to its sensitivity to human habit. A recent study by Chau et al. [11] investigated the health benefit from indoor air quality improvements in Hong Kong residence and concluded that the use of air cleaners provided the greatest annual health benefit.",

            "text": "A majority of air purifiers is based on filtration and adsorption technologies to remove airborne particulates, bioaerosols and malodors. Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) has been investigated for decades and is considered an attractive technology for treatment of organic air pollutants (i.e., VOCs and malodors) and disinfection of airborne microorganisms at room conditions [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Ultraviolet (UV) light is generally used as the light source in the PCO processes, but new generation of visible-light active TiO2 are also showing great promise [19], [20]. The most common approach is to coat the catalytic materials (usually nano-TiO2) on substrates to increase the irradiated area [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. TiO2 coating is therefore important to PCO performance. Coating delamination also poses a risk to environment and health [26], [27], [28], [29]. This work reports the preparation of nanostructured TiO2 coating by screen-printing method to obtain scratch-proof photoactive TiO2 coatings on surface. Tests on VOC removal and antimicrobial properties (bacteria and fungi) of the coatings made by screen-printing and wash-coating methods were performed in both laboratory and prototype air purifier.",

The greater roughness of the stainless steel and aluminum substrates used for the coated samples preclude the use of AFM and the samples were examined by SEM.

The chamber was first cleaned and then purged with compressed air for at least an hour. Baseline measurements were made before introducing VOC into the chamber. The VOC was fed to the chamber by bubbling a sidestream of air into a series of three bubblers kept in a constant temperature bath, two containing the liquid VOC (i.e., acetone) and the last packed with glass beads. This ensured that the air is saturated with the organic vapor before dilution into the main air stream entering the chamber to give a VOC level of 4\u201310 ppm. After equilibration, the fan and UV lamp were turned on, and the temperature, humidity and VOC concentration were monitored with time. The experimental run often lasted for sixteen hours and the VOC removal rate was calculated from the data. The quantum efficiency is calculated as the number of VOC removed via photochemical process divided by the number of photons absorbed in the same interval.",

The particle size obtained from the diffraction peak broadening is consistent with the AFM result shown in Fig. 2a. The sol deposited on the atomically smooth surface of the freshly cleaved mica appears as round clusters embedded in larger aggregates. The addition of PEG polymer to the sol (Sol A) prevented aggregation as shown in Fig. 2b and improved the particle dispersion through steric stabilization [45], but did not affect the particle size. Fig. 2c compares the nitrogen sorption isotherms for the TiO2 powders obtained from TiO2 sol (step 2\u2032\u2032) and Paste A (step 5\u2032, Scheme 1). Both samples display a type IV isotherm that indicates the presence of framework-confined mesopores. The absence of a sharp rise in nitrogen uptake near the saturation pressure (i.e., P/P\n0\n = 1) means that there are few macropores in the samples [46]. In addition to being a stabilizer, the PEG also acted as poragen and the TiO2 prepared from Paste A displayed larger surface area (235.7 m2\n g\u22121) and pore volume (0.3 cm3\n g\u22121) than sample obtained from the titania sol without PEG.

The Raman analysis indicates pure anatase TiO2 phase with crystal size of \u223c7 nm (Fig. 4). A high magnification picture of the TiO2-coated stainless steel in Fig. 5b shows that TiO2 are uniformly deposited on the surface and form a dense surface coating layer as shown in Fig. 5b inset.

No detectable loss in mass was observed for by the screen-printed samples and 10\u201320% loss was detected for the wash-coated samples. Table 2\nsummarizes the properties of TiO2 coating prepared by different methods.

Fig. 6b plots the PCO reaction rates of acetone on TiO2-coated plates prepared by wash-coating of Sol A and screen-printing of Paste A. After each reaction runs that lasted for 8 h, the plates were removed from the reactor and subjected to a jet of compressed water (0.25 L/s) for 10 min. The plate was dried and returned to the photoreactor and its photocatalytic activity was re-measured. The TiO2-plate prepared by wash-coating suffered an immediate loss in activity after the first washing (Fig. 6b), while the screen-printed plate maintained its activity even after the third wash. It is generally accepted that the hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and superoxide (O2\n\u2212) species generated by UV light react and convert adsorbed organic molecules into CO2 and H2O [12]. Therefore, the loss of TiO2 catalyst from poor adhesion (i.e., wash-coated TiO2) led to eventual decrease in PCO activity (Fig. 6b). The release of TiO2 also poses a threat to environment and health [26], [27], [28], [29].",

Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation has been studied for decades and is considered to be an attractive technology for treatment of organic pollutants in air [12], [39]. The TiO2 is a widely used photocatalyst, being highly efficient and stable as well as safe and inexpensive. The TiO2-coated plate assembly shown in Fig. 1a was tested in a closed chamber to verify the PCO performance of large TiO2 coating. A tangential air flow was used to achieve a higher mass transfer rate, but at an increased pressure drop as shown by the 3-dimensional, computational fluid dynamics model in Fig. 7a. The VOC concentration (i.e., acetone) in the chamber was monitored with time and plotted in Fig. 7b. The chamber displays a leak rate (i.e., natural decay) of ca. 30 ppb h\u22121 from an initial acetone concentration of ca. 9000 ppb. The leaks occurred at the chamber seals, which were replace after every ten runs. The chamber was allowed to equilibrate before the UV lamp is turned on. The tests performed on TiO2-coated plates prepared by wash-coating of Sol A and screen-printing of Paste A show both assemblies have similar high PCO activities (ca. 4000 ppb h\u22121 or 69 mmol h\u22121) and quantum efficiencies (79%). The experimental results were less than the theoretical conversion rate of 110 mmol h\u22121 from model calculation assuming ideal reactor conditions due to a lower mass transfer rate. However, the removal rate of 69 mmol h\u22121 from tangential flow was significantly higher compared to straight flow that had a measured conversion rate of 25 mmol h\u22121 (and quantum efficiency is 29%). The screen-printed plates were able to maintain a reaction rate of 55\u201378 mmol h\u22121 even after repeated washing.",

The reduction was modest compared to the \u201cantibacterial-drop test\u201d results in Table 3.

The TiO2 coating must display excellent adhesion to prevent the loss of catalyst during operation that could lead to lower performance and avoid health and environmental hazards posed by the released catalysts. A scratch-resistant coating was developed based on screen-printing technique. The polymer paste contains non-toxic PEG polymer to improve coating properties and serve as poragen to enhance the surface area and mesopore volume of the coated TiO2. The coating process is solvent-free, clean and applicable to most surfaces. A more quantitative measurement of film adhesion would be important for coating optimization. The PCO reaction study showed that the new TiO2 coatings are generally more active than the commercial P25 TiO2, however the reaction rates vary depending on the organic molecules. Reactions for pollutant mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations level (i.e.,<1 ppm) and humidity would provide better measure of the catalyst performance in indoor air. An unconventional approach was adopted in the design of the air purifier. Unlike traditional air purifiers that are designed to accommodate air purification technologies around an air handling system, the PCO reaction chamber was designed first and tested, before the air handling system was designed around the chamber. Thus, allowing us to optimize the PCO performance of the air purifier. This general approach is applicable to other environmental catalysts [53], [54], [55], [56], [57].",
