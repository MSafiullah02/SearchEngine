Restrictive public health measures have severe unintended psychological and social consequences, characterized by deprivation of fundamental right and freedoms and restrictions on work, mobility and social support (Brooks et al., 2020; Galea, et al., 2020) . It has been widely reported that such a setting has deleterious effects on mental health in persons (in)directly in contact with the infectious agent; persons that are vulnerable to biological and psychological stressors; frontline professionals and members of general public (Brooks et al., 2020; Fiorillo and Gorwood, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020; . The pandemic may exacerbate existing mental health disorders (that are highly prevalent) and contribute to \"new\" stress-related mental health disruptions and disorders even in previously unaffected (\"healthy\") populations. This is followed by limited availability and access to mental health services creating a significant gap between needs and possibilities (Galea, et al., 2020; Pfefferbaum and North, 2020) .",
