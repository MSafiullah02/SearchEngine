SARS-COV-2 enters human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. It has a binding affinity 10\u201315 times greater than the SARS virus responsible for a smaller outbreak in 2003.1 The ACE-2 receptor is a cell membrane\u2013associated protein that can be found in epithelial (cardiac and renal) cells, endothelial (pulmonary and vascular) cells, and cells of the oral mucosa and nasopharynx (Figure 1). When SARS-COV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it reduces intracellular ACE-2 protein activity.2,3 In the heart, ACE-2 is involved in endothelial regulation, vasoconstriction, and cardiac function. In the renal system, ACE-2 impairment has been implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis of the renal tissue.4 The role of ACE-2 in the lung is incompletely understood, but increased activity may possibly reduce lung injury in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).5",

For COVID-19 intubations, video laryngoscopy with appropriate PPE (contact, droplet, and airborne), ideally in a negative pressure environment and with the most experienced personnel performing the laryngoscopy, may reduce the likelihood of health care infection (Figure 2). Bag mask ventilation may also increase the risk of aerosolization. In many centers, central line and arterial line insertion are performed in the same encounter to reduce donning/doffing episodes for clinicians and radiology staff. Once intubated, lung-protective ventilation is the cornerstone of ARDS management, and ARDSNet-based principles of ventilation should be followed.",

Small tidal volumes combined with high PEEP and hypercarbia may contribute to air-hunger and deep sedation may be required (see Neurologic Considerations section for drug choices and strategies). Auto-PEEP can cause severe reductions in cardiac output and may do so when expiratory gas flow does not reach 0 L/s before the next breath. In such patients, disconnecting the ventilator can prevent cardiac arrest. If the ventilator must be disconnected for a COVID-19 patient, caregivers should be careful to limit aerosolization as much as is possible (ie, disconnecting from the circuit in a way that leaves any filtering device in place on the endotracheal tube). Instead, if clinically appropriate, shortening inspiratory time, treating bronchospasm if present, and increasing sedation may resolve the issue.",

The benefit of early paralysis with neuromuscular blocking agents for 48 hours remains uncertain.29,30 Due to low tidal volume ventilation, permissive hypercarbia can occur. Routine supportive care during mechanical ventilation includes stress ulcer prophylaxis, spontaneous awakening trials coupled with spontaneous breathing trials (SAT/SBT) where safe, and the use of bundled care to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis. The importance of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis deserves emphasis, given the reported hypercoagulable state10 and high rate of DVT9 in patients with COVID-19. There is some evidence that elevated D-dimer levels may be associated with poor prognosis.31 It is believed that SARS-COV-2 may facilitate both endothelial activation of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII as well as complement-mediated microvascular injury and thrombosis.32 Both pathways would contribute to a hypercoagulable state. Because of the reduced mortality associated with anticoagulation in severe COVID-19 cases, some authors have recommended therapeutic doses of anticoagulation.33,34 In the absence of shock, fluid therapy should be managed conservatively to minimize the contribution of pulmonary edema to gas exchange and lung compliance.35 The inhaled pulmonary vasodilator (ie, nitric oxide) can be trialed to reduce V/Q mismatch and shunt but can worsen hypotension or hypoxemia.36 Use of methylprednisone for ARDS, in general, and for COVID-19, specifically, remains controversial.37\u201339 In cases of refractory hypoxemia and hypercarbia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be considered (see Extracorporeal Life Support Considerationssection).40",

Empiric antibiotics were recommended because bacterial coinfection may be difficult to recognize and diagnose (Table). Daily assessment for de-escalation, duration, and antibiotic spectrum was recommended based on microbiology specimens. In regard to fever management, acetaminophen was viewed as a patient comfort strategy. For the patient presenting in high output septic shock, conservative and judicious resuscitation with crystalloids was preferred over liberal fluid resuscitation due to lung injury associated with a concomitant capillary leak syndrome and poor outcomes with higher cumulative fluid balances in ARDS. If a vasoactive agent was needed, the panel recommended norepinephrine as the preferred first-line vasoactive agent.

The ABCDEF Bundle is helpful to determine sedation needs and is implemented in the following fashion: Assess, Prevent, and Manage Pain, Both SAT and SBT, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium: Assess, Prevent, and Manage, Early mobility and Exercise, and Family engagement and empowerment.70 Delirium screening should be performed daily in patients who are able to participate, as delirium increases mortality and should be prevented.71 The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) is commonly used to screen patients for delirium and is validated for patients receiving sedation and on mechanical ventilation.72 Sedation should be titrated using a clinical scale such as the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) score ranges from +4 (combative), 0 (awake and calm), to \u22125 (comatose), and a reasonable goal would be a range of 0 to \u22122.73 Such scales are preferred over EEG monitoring.74 Deeper sedation is often required to tolerate highPEEP ventilator settings and for patients who will require paralysis. Strict ventilator synchrony (eg, not overbreathing or \u201cdouble-stacking\u201d) is important to avoid increased oxygen consumption and barotrauma. Dexmedetomidine should not be used without other amnestic medication in patients requiring neuromuscular blockade, and bispectral index(BIS) monitor might be suited to such patients.74 Of note, sevoflurane and propofol interact with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to increase the likelihood of QTc prolongation. Remdesivir does not have known interactions with any major anesthesia drugs. Propofol infusion syndrome should always be considered if sudden acidosis occurs after prolonged infusion, particularly in younger patients.75 Furthermore, pain control with IV infusions and enteral regimens are both acceptable. Half of ICU patients will have pain, and multimodal regimens can be used even when patients are mechanically ventilated (eg, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, transdermal lidocaine, tramadol, muscle relaxants [methocarbamol, etc],and opioids).76",

One potential solution is staged anticoagulation for patients on CRRT: regional citrate anticoagulation, followed by escalation to prefilter heparin administration with serum monitoring of heparin levels per local protocol, and then finally consideration of alternative systemic anticoagulants (ie, direct thrombin inhibitors). Potential local or national shortages of citrate, calcium, and/or systemic anticoagulants may influence the optimal approach.

Many critically ill patients with COVID-19 will require sedation for mechanical ventilation, and the 2018 SCCM guidelines are appropriate for the care of these patients. Most importantly, sedation should be targeted to a desired effect, including ventilator synchrony, with interruptions daily if possible, and patients will often require deep sedation if they are severely hypoxemic or require neuromuscular blockade. AKI is a common consequence of COVID-19, either due to ATN or hypotension. The hypercoagulability of COVID-19 patients may lead to increased clotting of CRRT filters but the nature of this hypercoagulability is not defined. The need for glycemic control is not unique to patients with COVID-19, but because of the need to limit room entry, patients who might otherwise be managed with an insulin infusion should be first trialed on a subcutaneous regimen. The role of steroids has been raised for both lung injury and hemodynamic aspects of care of COVID-19 patients, but the best evidence for steroids is for the treatment of septic shock refractory to pressors and for adrenal insufficiency. Finally, because of the expected high mortality of critically ill patients, and the possibility that the number of patients will exceed the resources available, ethical considerations must be a part of health care systems\u2019 response plans. Systems, not individual clinicians, should develop plans for how to triage and ration care requiring limited resources (eg, ventilators, ICU beds, blood products), and, perhaps more important than many of the medical strategies described above, clinicians must address the end-of-life concerns of patients who have a high likelihood of dying of this disease.",
