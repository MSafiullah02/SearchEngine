            "text": "The BRACE CORONA trial was designed to test the impact of discontinuation compared with maintenance of chronic ACEI/ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19. This is one of several questions facing physicians in the setting of COVID-19 and data are needed from randomized clinical trials like BRACE CORONA. Because renin-angiotensin system inhibitors increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19.15 The presence of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells makes the lungs a preferred site of entry for the virus, which explains the respiratory manifestations in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis of worse outcomes associated with the use of ACEI or ARB in patients with COVID-19 was recently shown in observational studies.25,26 However, a cause-effect relation between the use of ACEI or ARB and adverse events in COVID-19 cannot be established since many confounding factors could explain a worse or better prognosis for these patients in observational analyses. In a recent retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all-cause mortality was lower among patients on ACEI/ARB therapy when compared with those not using ACEI/ARBs.33 An observational analysis from a single-center study showed that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with severity of COVID-19 infection or worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with hypertension.34 Nonetheless, the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on ACE2 is uncertain and the potential harm related to this mechanism is not well defined.31,32 In addition, the use of ACEI or ARBs could be beneficial not only due to the well-known cardiovascular protection,32 but also because of the potential respiratory system protection in patients affected by severe respiratory disease.15,27 Considering that these high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 are commonly hospitalized, the decision regarding the best approach for the management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is critical. In a scenario of apparent equipoise without high quality scientific evidence, the medical decisions in clinical practice have been heterogeneous. Thus, a randomized clinical trial is necessary to guide practice.",

However, the critical and urgent nature of a pandemic encourages opportunities to create more efficient research processes, which can be adopted for use in clinical research conducted during non-pandemic times. In a new and threatening situation like the COVID-19 pandemic there is no specific evidence to guide medical therapy, yet there is an urgent need to quickly answer the clinical questions that arise in order to guide treatment of the hundreds of thousands of people infected with a potentially lethal disease. Collaborative pragmatic studies are one of the best solutions in this scenario.5 BRACE CORONA took less than 3 weeks from protocol development to first patient randomized, including national ethics board review and approval, which is unprecedented in Brazil (Figure 4\n). The COVID-19 registry is already collecting the key clinical variables and outcomes that will be used for the randomized trial. Adding randomization to this structure allows for an efficient process, which can provide the scientific community with a streamlined approach to answer a relevant clinical question with less bureaucracy and at lower cost. In addition, clinicians on the frontline, who are already very interested in answering this medical question, will be highly engaged with the trial.",

Since many different complications could occur due to the interaction between COVID-19, baseline cardiovascular condition, and therapies used by these patients, the primary study outcome chosen for BRACE CORONA (DAOH at 30 days) was also very pragmatic and encompasses the potential effect of any relevant medical complication. Therefore, regardless of the type of in-hospital complication, it will be captured in the study and DAOH will ultimately represent a meaningful outcome of the net benefit from the patient's perspective. This efficient model of a registry-based randomized trial, which is the first of its kind in Brazil, has already been applied successfully in other countries35,36 and represents a unique opportunity during the global crisis of COVID-19 that could serve as an important legacy to the medical community.",

            "text": "Figure 1: A) Renin Angiotensin System and COVID-19: The spike proteins covering the coronavirus bind to ACE2 receptors primarily on type II alveolar cells, allowing the v\u00edrus to inject its RNA. The host cell is destroyed in this process. After infection, type II cells release inflammatory signals to recruit immune cells. When the immune system attacks the area of infection it also kills healthy alveolar cells. This may result in alveolar collapse due to loss of surfactant from type lI cells and acute lung injury. In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), angiotensin I (Ang I) is converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE. Ang II mediates vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidative and pro-thrombotic effects (possibly by increasing levels of PAI-1) through agonism of the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). ACE2 converts Ang II to angiotensin (1\u20137), which finally binds to Mas receptor (MasR) and mediates many beneficial actions, including vasodilation and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Thus, ACE2/Ang (1\u20137)/MasR axis has opposite actions to ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. ACE2 limits the adverse vasoconstrictor and profibrotic effects of Ang II through its degradation and by counteracting its actions through the formation of Ang (1\u20137). SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity as a consequence of increased internalization and shedding of ACE2 from the cell surface further tipping the ACE/ACE2 balance to a predominant ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis signaling, in which Ang II may then foster pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, ultimately progressing towards acute lung injury . B) Effects of RAAS inhibition in COVID-19: There are different postulated mechanisms by which inhibition of the RAAS with an ACEI or ARB might be dangerous or protective in COVID-19. Hypothesis 1 \u2014 RAAS inhibition is harmful in COVID-19 (left) ACEI and ARBs could theoretically increase the risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection and more severe COVID-19 owing to the role of ACE2 as the viral binding site. Although ACEIs and ARBs do not directly affect ACE2 activity, this premise is based in part on the findings in some studies that ACEIs and ARBs may increase ACE2 levels and thus enhance viral entry. Hypothesis 2 \u2014 RAAS inhibition is protective in COVID-19 (right) ACEIs and ARBs may mitigate COVID-19 by attenuating Ang II-mediated acute lung impairment. Decreasing production of Ang II with an ACEI or blocking Ang II\u2013AT1R actions with an ARB may reduce the levels of prothrombotic substances (such as PAI-1) and intensify the formation of Ang (1\u20137) by ACE2 and activation of the MasR, which attenuates inflammation and fibrosis and consequently may attenuate lung damage.
