There were ninety-nine cases (48.5%) that presented to the hospital with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint. Seven of them (3.4%) had digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms. Anorexia and diarrhea dominate among the symptoms (83.8% and 29.3%, respectively), while abdominal pain was reported in 0.4% of the patients.

Abdominal pain was the most common clinical indication among nineteen patients, and eleven patients had no extrapulmonary findings. Seventeen of the patients tested positive for COVID-19 [6] .",

Our patient presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain and nausea, with incidental findings on the lung bases at abdominal CT that strongly suggested COVID-19 pneumonia. Detecting the typical appearance of COVID-19 in the visualized part of the lung bases made the presence of the disease a strong possibility. The sensitivity and specificity of chest CT were 94% and 37%, respectively, based on a recent meta-analysis study. However, variability has also been reported. [7] A combination of GGO and consolidative opacities is the most common radiologic finding in chest CT and can be found in up to 88% of cases with COVID-19. [8.9.10.11] In our case, the abdominal radiologist was first to suggest COVID-19 after detecting the typical features of COVID-19 infection. The CT findings revealed at least four typical features of COVID-19 as per RSNA. [3] A retrospective study done on three patients at the University of Chicago found that all similarly presented with abdominal pain without significant respiratory symptoms. The abdominal radiologist suspected the differential diagnosis because of findings in the lung bases on the abdominal CT, and then the disease was not originally suspected in the ED because of the lack of a typical presentation. The referring healthcare provider was informed about the suspicion. Later on, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing confirmed the diagnosis [12] .",
