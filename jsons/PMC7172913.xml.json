Although optimal animal models for the identification of protective immune correlates for MERS are still scarce, current mouse models suggest a crucial role for antibodies and T cells in the induction of protective immunity.6, 7, 8 In humans, one study showed a positive correlation of CD4 T-cell responses and neutralising antibodies with severe disease progression, and a positive correlation of strong virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses with reduced morbidity;9 conversely, another study reported a positive association between early CD8 T-cell responses and disease severity in acute MERS-CoV infection.10 A role of antibodies in protection was shown in mice that received convalescent sera from survivors.9 The animal and human data underline that a MERS vaccine candidate should preferentially induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and that the timing and dose of a vaccine could be crucial for protection.",

The MERS vaccine candidate MVA-MERS-S investigated in this study encodes the full MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein. Preclinical studies have shown that MVA-MERS-S induced neutralising antibodies6 and conferred protection against MERS-CoV in mice15 expressing the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor. Furthermore, a reduction in viral replication in a MERS-CoV challenge after MVA-MERS-S vaccination was successfully demonstrated in dromedary camels.16 These preclinical data support the advancement of the vaccine candidate MVA-MERS-S to test the safety and immunogenicity in human clinical trials.",

In this context, a notable outcome of the mouse experiments was the protective capacity of S1-specific non-RBD and S2-specific neutralising mouse antibodies against MERS-CoV.6, 7, 24 Furthermore, it was demonstrated that S2 monoclonal antibodies showed only moderate neutralising capacity in vitro but were highly protective from challenge in vivo, suggesting that strong neutralising activity is not conditional for protection.7 Future analyses should therefore include not only MERS-CoV S1-specific but also S2-specific antibody assays, and other functional antibody read-outs beyond neutralisation capacity, which are currently understudied. Systems-serology approaches including non-neutralising functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis might provide insight into MVA-MERS-S-induced immunity and dissect additional mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection. However, it should be noted that although animal studies indicate a crucial role for antibodies in protection against MERS, the human data available from MERS-CoV-infected individuals so far did not reveal a clear and strong correlation between MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses and MERS-CoV viral load.25, 26\n",

Responses persisted until day 180 in a third of study participants (seven [32%] of 22 participants), suggesting that vaccine-induced T-cell responses were maintained slightly longer than humoral immune responses (three [14%] of 22 participants). We observed stronger and more robust T-cell responses in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. Although this finding was not significant, it might be considered in future studies that focus on dose finding when including a larger number of participants. However, the exact contribution of T-cell immunity to vaccine-induced or natural protection against the disease and viral clearance remains to be determined and needs further investigation.",

MVA-specific humoral responses against the MVA vector were assessed post-hoc using a virus neutralisation test assay against wild-type MVA to address their potential effect on MERS-CoV spike-specific antibodies. Although MVA-specific neutralising antibodies were induced, no correlation with MERS-CoV-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed. Currently, there is no strong evidence that induced or pre-existing MVA-specific immunity interferes with vaccine-induced immune responses when using MVA as a vector. Our study and the trial using MVA-H5-sfMR18 show that MVA-based vaccines can elicit antibody responses against the antigenic insert following the second and third immunisation, despite the induction of anti-vector immunity after the prime injection. The exact impact of pre-existing immune responses against MVA requires further investigation in future studies.",

In the context of limited human data on correlates of protection, it is currently challenging to predict whether MVA-MERS-S is suitable for rapidly evolving epidemic situations, because it remains unclear which specific parameters are relevant for the defence against MERS-CoV. It is conceivable that homologous MVA prime\u2013boost vaccination might not be the final and optimised vaccination schedule for MVA-MERS-S. Different strategies including heterologous prime\u2013boost regimens should be evaluated in future trials. Several MERS vaccine candidates are currently being tested in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is funding five different vaccine platforms, with MVA-MERS-S, ChAdOx1, and DNA being the most advanced. In the first MERS vaccine trial in humans reported to date, which investigated a DNA-based vaccine (GLS-5300),28 a homologous prime\u2013boost\u2013boost regime was used. Similar to our study, the authors observed a favourable safety profile and induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. Although seroreactivity and cellular responses were largely maintained over the study period of 60 weeks, neutralising antibodies were detectable in only 48% of vaccine recipients, peaked about 2 weeks after the second boost, and rapidly declined.",
