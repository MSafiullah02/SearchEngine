The recombinant btHKU5.2 nucleocapsid protein\u2013based ELISA was developed by the CDC to detect the presence of antibodies that cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein in serum samples from possible MERS cases. If cross-reactive antibodies were detected in serum samples, then confirmation of MERS-specific antibodies was determined by either MERS-CoV MNT or IFA. Pi-BatCoV HKU5.2 nucleocapsid (N) gene in pET-28b (+) plasmid was provided by Dr Susanna Lau, University of Hong Kong. His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Recombinant HKU5.2N protein indirect ELISA was developed using a modified version of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV N ELISA described by Haynes et al [5]. Sera were considered positive when the optical density (OD) values were at or above the 0.43 cutoff value (mean absorbance at 405 nm of sera from US blood donors plus 3 standard deviations). The overall specificity of the assay was determined after screening 545 serum samples from donors in the United States and the Middle East and persons with other non-MERS respiratory infections (eg, human coronavirus [hCoV] OC43, hCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, hCoV-NL63, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, H1N1). The assay specificity was 96.7% (527/545). Serum from HKU1 human serum was not available for evaluation; however, HKU1 mouse hyperimmune serum did not cross-react with the HKU5.2 N protein. At a screening dilution of 1:400, sera with OD values at or near the cutoff were titered with serial 4-fold dilutions (1:100\u20131:6400) and further evaluated using MERS-CoV (Hu/Jordan-N3/2012) (GenBank KC776174.1) IFA and MNT.",

As for those indeterminate laboratory findings among subjects with documented MERS-CoV exposure(s) but having only an ELISA-positive result and mild or absent respiratory symptoms, it is possible that the viral exposure to these subjects did not trigger a long-lasting IFA- or MNT-recognizable immune response.",

Infection control practices at both transfer receiving hospitals may have been important in preventing MERS-CoV transmission in those facilities. Since the discovery of the MERS-CoV, enhanced surveillance for severe acute respiratory illnesses in Jordan has been implemented. International severe acute respiratory infection surveillance, collaborative investigations, and vigilance among healthcare providers are necessary components for addressing and preventing the further spread of MERS-CoV worldwide.",
