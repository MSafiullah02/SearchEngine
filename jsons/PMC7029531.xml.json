            "text": "The severity of the disease is directly related to the species of Plasmodium and the geographical dispersion and proportion of Anopheles. There are about 30 species of Anopheles, which are responsible for transmission of malaria across the world [3]. One of the most considerable challenge in malaria control is the diversity of the vector and parasite species in different endemic regions which means distinct strategies must be considered for each geographical region [4]. For instance, Anopheles gambiae is the main malaria vector in sub-Saharan of Africa, while Anopheles stephensi is the most prevalent vector which is spread from the east of Africa (Djibouti and Ethiopia) to the south regions of China [5]. In addition, resistance to insecticides and drugs increases the complexity of malaria treatment and control [6\u20138]. Moreover, proximity with special endemic malaria regions affects the malaria control progress and, therefore, needs more considerations to achieve the final goal. For example, Iran which is in elimination phase is a neighbour of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are categorized in the \u201cControl Phase\u201d with high prevalence of malaria. This situation might be established in many parts of the world and may lead to the failure of the malaria elimination goals of the United Nations by 2030 [9]. According to the malEra guidelines, vaccines are one of the main tools for malaria control and with regards to the progress in the elimination programme; specific types of vaccines should be considered for each country. Development of the vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs) was emphasized by the vaccine consultative group for countries that have passed the pre-elimination step and have proceeded to the global goal [10]. VIMTs are divided into various types; one type is the classical transmission-blocking vaccine that blocks the sexual parasite development by targeting the required effector molecules in the vector, including mosquito-based transmission-blocking vaccines with targets such as Anopheles gambiae aminopeptidase N-1 (AgAPN-1) [11], CPBAg1 (Carboxy Peptidase B1) [12, 13], Trypsin [14], saglin [15], FREP 1 [16, 17], and SGS1 [18]. APN-1 is a candidate molecule for which the blocking efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum in An. gambiae has been confirmed [19]. Given the fact that Jacalin prevents ookinete attachment by masking the glycan ligands on the surface of midgut epithelial cells, Dinglasan et al. used affinity chromatography to identify its receptor on the midgut epithelial cells of An. gambiae. Some glycoproteins, such as APN-1, are receptors for the lectin-similar structures of ookinete that trigger the attachment of ookinetes to the internal side of the epithelium and are essential for preceding the sexual development of parasite in the mosquito midgut [13, 16, 20].",

Then, the entire protein surface was scanned using the SwissDock to identify the most probable interaction sites with bestatin. This scanning is performed based on multi-objective hybrid evolutionary algorithm. In this method, the probability of binding the ligand to receptor in the form of random and semi-random is examined at two levels of accuracy. In the first stage, screening is faster and has less accuracy (simple-Fitness), but in the second stage, screening is time-consuming and has high-precision (full-Fitness). The best appropriate ligand binding site is calculated based on the highest free energy which determined by the analytical Generalized Born Molecular Volume performed in the CHARMM program among the different binding probabilities. This sampling and selecting of the target cavity is performed with the accuracy of 2 angstroms in the crystal structure [34].",

These two elements should interact together for final presentation of the small processed peptides. Therefore, we evaluated the potential presentation of our target protein with the common MHC-II alleles in Iran using the NetMHCII 2.2 and pyDockWEB web based servers to evaluate the induction of potential humoral response. To perform this evaluation, the MHC-II binding regions of AsAPN-1 and their binding affinities with receptors were predicted in the first step. According to the recommendations of Vina et al.

Subsequently, the binding affinity between the peptide segments and prevalent alleles were investigated using the NetMHCII 2.2 and pyDockWEB web based servers. NetMHCII 2.2 predicts the binding efficacy of peptides to HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP alleles using the artificial neuron networks. The prediction values are given in nanomolar IC50 values, and binding efficiency are determined by the strong and weak values [37]. pyDockWEB, as a structure-based server, was used for predicting the MHC-II binding properties with an overall \u0394G which includes electrostatics, desolvation energy, and limited van der Waals contribution [38].

Next, pFastBac-full apn construct, was first transformed to Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 and the purified pFastBac-full apn was transformed to E. coli DH10Bac subsequently and confirmed using sequencing. The generation of recombinant virus and transposition was performed according to the recommendations of Invitrogen for Bac-to-Bac system (http://www.ThermoFisher.com). The screening and presence of the recombinant bacmid (pFastBac-full apn) was done by colony-PCR using M13 Forward and Reverse primers. Then, recombinant bacmid was purified from one of the selected colonies and transfected into the Sf9 cells using the Cellfectin II (Invitrogen). This step was performed in order to generate the recombinant baculovirus stock P1. P1 viruses were harvested and stored at 4 \u00b0C. In order to earn the highest yield of recombinant virus, the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by screening the 1,3,5,7 MOIs. To determine the expression kinetics of the target recombinant protein, screening was preformed within 0 until 96 h of post infection using SDS-PAGE. Afterwards, P1 stock virus was used to get the P2 stock in the fresh Sf9 cells at 27 \u00b0C for maximum 96 h and similarly P2 virus was used for producing the high titer of P3. Finally, P3 viruses were harvested and used for recombinant protein expression according to the Invitrogen protocol (http://www.ThermoFisher.com). For recombinant AsAPN-1 expression analysis, 1 ml of the harvested culture was analysed using the SDS-PAGE analysis. Solubility of the expressed recombinant protein was determined according to the QIAexpressionist protocols (http://kirschner.med.harvard.edu/files/protocols/QIAGEN_QIAexpressionist_EN.pdf) [39]. With regard that 6X His-tag was embedded in the upstream of the target protein by the used expression system, Ni-NTA (QIAGEN, Germany) beads were used for protein purification under the hybrid purification condition according to the Life Technologies\u2122\u2019 instruction with few modifications in buffer ingredients [40]. Hybrid purification method is a type of purification that the 3D structure and native folding of the target protein is rearranged beyond denaturation and no need to renaturing after purification. Different buffer ingredients were: lysis and denaturing binding buffer contained 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris\u00b7Cl, 8 M urea and 5\u20138 mM imidazole at pH 8.5; denaturing wash buffer contained 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris\u00b7Cl, 8 M urea at pH to 6.3; and native elution buffer contained 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole at pH 8.5. In brief, cultured cells were collected from the 75 cm2 cell culture flasks which contained 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and pelleted cells were lysed using 6 ml of lysis and denaturing binding Buffer. Then, lysis solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. Next, the supernatant was incubated at 23 \u00b0C for 60 min with Ni-NTA agarose beads while those were rotating. After that, Ni-NTA agarose beads were washed three times with denaturing wash buffer. In the last step, target protein was eluted using the native elution buffer. The total purified protein was desalted using the Econo-Pac\u00ae (Bio Rad, USA) and finally analysed using SDS-PAGE.

Structural comparison of AsAPN-1 and AgAPN-1, revealed that our target protein is composed of an N-terminal (residues 1-19), a C-terminal ecto-domain (residues 36-1005) and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor (residues 1006-1031) (Fig. 3b). As APN-1 has consisted of two symmetric units (A and B homologues) (Fig. 3a, b). Ectodomain (residues 69-954) is composed of four domains (I\u2013IV), which have metallopeptidase M1-family activity. Domain I (residues 69-281) is predicted that composed of a 15 \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 3b). Domain II is the catalytic domain (residues 282-534) which contains the substrate recognition site (H377EYAH381) and zinc-binding motif (NE400GFA). Domain III and domain IV (the C-terminal region) encompass the residues 535-625 and residues 626-954, respectively. It is predicted that the active site is located in domain II, and zinc ion is coordinated with the NEGFA motif and the N-terminus of the modeled protein (Fig. 3c). RMSD of the structurally critical residues of AsAPN-1 and AgAPN-1 are presented in Table 3. Moreover, analysis of the reactive residues in hydrogen binding plot (Fig. 4a, b), the torsional angles (Ramachandran plot) (Fig. 4c, d) and stoichiometry analysis of the alpha Carbons of AsAPN-1 and AgAPN-1(Fig. 4e, f) revealed that those have the same patterns. Further analysis revealed that AsAPN-1 has five residues (G832TGVE836) more than AgAPN-1 in domain II which acts as a linker between the two alpha-helixes and superimposition reveled that it had no effect on the three-dimensional structure of AsAPN-1 and these five residues are seen as a protrusion in the protein structure in comparison to AgAPN-1 (Fig. 5).",

Therefore, Anopheles spp. due to their behaviour and ability for malaria transmission, are one of the main targets for restricting this disease. Vaccines have been the primary objects to achieve this goal from previous years, but most of them have been designed based on parasite antigens [43]. Few studies have been performed to find the critical molecules in the vector, which are essential for sexual parasite development, and few vector-based antigens have been introduced as promising candidates for vaccine development against malaria [44]. Most of these molecules are considered as classical transmission-blocking vaccines, which are a category of VIMTs. According to the considerable results of AgAPN-1 as a TBV candidate for regions where An. gambiae is the main vector, AsAPN-1 was characterized in this study to provide the basic and necessary information for evaluating its potential role as a TBV candidate molecule in regions where An. stephensi plays the main role in malaria transmission.",

With regard to the structure of several reported isoforms of apn gene in different insects, it could be concluded that the characterized gene is the correct isoform of agapn-1 in An. stephensi. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analysis of AsAPN-1and its comparison with some characterized APN proteins from other insects revealed that AsAPN-1 is located in the same branch with AgAPN-1. In addition, protein sequence alignment of the APN enzymes from the seven species of insects showed that the structural residues of their active sites are conserved, except the case that glutamic acid had been substituted with glutamine in AsAPN-1 at 186 position. Furthermore, involved residues in zinc binding motif are fully conserved. Another interesting point is peptide 9, a small protective peptide against Plasmodium spp. infection which has more than 50% similarity among the aligned sequences (Fig. 2).

For instance, Ekeruche-Makinde et al. [46] observed that the outcome of T-cell receptor/MHC interaction is dependent on the peptide length and the sequence identity of the MHC-bound peptide [46]. Immunoinformatics analysis showed that the length of the in silico predicted antigenic peptides are almost 9\u201314 residues and it is expected that the processing and presenting of AsAPN-1 on MHC-II groove be done well in antigen processing cells of immune system. Among the predicted antigenic peptides of AsAPN-1, there are only one fragments that their lengths are 27 residues and these results propose a good presentation of AsAPN-1 to immune system (Table 5). Therefore, peptides might not be able to bind the MHC groove in suitable and effective form. It is interesting that peptide 9, which was identified and confirmed by Dinglasan et al. as the shortest and best protective peptide in the experimental assays, acquired good scores for presenting with the common MHC-II alleles in Iran [21].",

Each individual has specific alleles which may be different in distinct geographical regions [48]. Therefore, for designing an effective recombinant immunogenic vaccine, considering and evaluating the prevalence of an allele in the target area is crucial [49]. Draheim et al. study disclosed that the presentation of malaria antigen by MHC-II on dendritic cell is particularly important in induction of an effective immune response [50]. According to the in silico analysis, it is predicted that nine antigenic peptides have the best scores for perfect processing and presentation ability with the DQA10102-DQB10602 and DR B1 alleles and those could be considered as candidates for developing a recombinant subunit vaccine (Additional file 3) [51]. A study on Fula ethnic group (the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa) showed that the presented antigens by DQA-DQB are associated with the higher levels of antibody production [51]. With regard to the geographical location and ethnic genome polymorphisms, prediction of the immune response before any laboratory analysis is critical. Herein, HLA-DRB1 allele which is common among the Caucasian and sub-Saharan African populations and has been evaluated in the Dinglasan et al. study, has the best predicted binding efficiency in comparison to the other examined MHC alleles in our analysis. Furthermore, analysis using pyDockWEB and NetMHCII revealed that AsAPN-1 is well processed and presented by the common MHC-II alleles in Iran and potentially could be a suitable candidate molecule for vaccine development. In addition, NetMHCII scores and statistical data revealed that AsAPN-1 is better processed and presented by DP, DQ and DR alleles in comparison with AgAPN-1. With regard to the presence of An. stephensi in Iran and neighbouring countries and the frequency of the mentioned alleles in this region, this seems that there is a natural adaptation between the target antigen and immune system.",

Variation in antigenic epitopes of a protein would not lead to the production of effective neutralizing antibodies by immune system.

In silico analysis of the present study revealed that our target protein has a stable and rigid structure, which is suitable for recombinant antigen production except the first and second residues which are located in the N- terminal region and have variable structure. It is predicted that there are three variable regions in the C-terminal region. Therefore, according to this point and the results of Dinglasan et al. it is reasonable to consider N-terminal part, including peptide 9, for developing an efficient vaccine. Additionally, this location is represented by the most common MHC-II alleles in the selected area in this study and possibly other neighbor countries in the Middle East region. In addition, several previous investigations evaluated the protection efficacy of different segments of AgAPN1 [52]. According to the findings of Dinglasan et al. residues at positions 758 and 821 are the ookinete attachment sites that their blocking with antibodies could be resulted in inhibition of the sexual P. falciparum development in the mosquito midgut [53]. Moreover, based on the performed peptide mapping by Armistead et al., it was found that the produced antibodies against the peptide 9 have the best inhibitory effects on ookinete attachment. In another study, Atkinson et al. performed peptide mapping which showed that the size of epitopes were 60 to 200 amino acids long. Their study revealed that some peptides, despite are on the surface, did not have the suitable performance, and only peptide 9, which has been located at residues 173-194, had the perfect inhibitory feature.

Green spots which are enclosed in blue lines, indicate that residues are in the most favored region, while the spots which are located out of the redlines are in the disallowed regions. Stoichiometry analysis of Carbon-\u03b1: the stoichiometry analysis of alpha carbons in AsAPN-1 (e) and AgAPN-1 (f) revealed that the topologies of carbons-\u03b1 in both molecules are very similar.

A negative value is associated with the non-polar residues and hydrophobic regions and values greater than 0 represent the hydrophilic regions. All residues which are located in the N-terminal and C-terminal of the AsAPN-1 have suitable hydrophilicity. b Accessibility of AsAPN-1 analysis using the Protscale-ExPASy server revealed that the most of residues which are located in the N-terminal and C-terminal of AsAPN-1 are accessible in the secondary structure and have a good position for presentation to immune system. In this prediction, values greater than 0 have suitable accessibility for immune system. c Amino acid polarity was determined by Protscale-ExPASy. Our results showed that the 230 and 200 residues of the N-terminal and C-terminal of AsAPN-1 are polar, respectively. dN-glycosylation; this analysis was performed by NetNglyc 1.0 server. Our analysis revealed that V2, N148, and N589 positions have acceptable score for N-glycosylation. e Prediction of dynamic nature of AsAPN1 using DynaMine server: Our results showed that the most of regions of AsAPN-1 are rigid, and there are only four flexible regions with the lowest predicted S2 value which are M1(0.59)-V2(0.61), G763-(0.62), Y764(0.62) and A975 (0.61)-G976(0.61) residues.
