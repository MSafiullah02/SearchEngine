Phylogenetic analysis was performed with Mega version 4 by using 500 bootstrapped replicates and the neighbor-joining algorithm with HRV87 as the outgroup.47 Nucleotide identity between strains within each HRV species (A, B, or C) was calculated, and the mean diversity between HRV species was compared with a 2-tailed t test assuming unequal variance.",

To assess for adjusted effects of host factors on the bronchiolitis severity score, we used multivariable ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model). Factors included were the infant\u2019s illness age, sex, gestational age, race, smoking, and coinfection status and maternal history of atopy. Separate adjusted models were used to assess the role of maternal asthma, family history of atopy, and laboratory and clinically assessed maternal atopy. The main findings are presented based on the 162 infants with HRV infection to assess broadly the scope of HRV-associated illness. Because coinfections with other viruses can affect clinical presentation, a sensitivity analysis restricted to the HRV group without coinfection for other tested viruses was performed to assess for host factors mentioned above and the severity of bronchiolitis.",

First, we did not test concurrent healthy control subjects to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic HRV infection, which is well described.24, 51, 52 Because HRV can cause asymptomatic infection, our data suggest but do not prove that HRV infection was the causative agent for the respiratory tract illnesses, bronchiolitis, and URIs. However, we performed highly sensitive molecular testing for the spectrum of viruses known to cause infant respiratory tract viral illnesses, including influenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, and human coronaviruses, including OC43, 229E, and NL63 (data not shown), with no other virus detected in 73.5% of the HRV-positive children, strongly suggesting that HRV was the causative pathogen. Other studies support these findings.53, 54 In addition, this study cannot delineate population-based rates of HRV-associated lower respiratory tract illnesses and URIs because the cohort did not equally enroll hospitalized and nonhospitalized infants, with nearly two thirds of the cohort being hospitalized infants, thus overrepresenting infants with bronchiolitis. A final limitation was that we evaluated only 1 geographic site. However, we report a comprehensive study over 4 years in a site that captures more than 90% of Nashville-Davidson county infant hospitalizations.",

Predominant HRV groups varied by season and year, with substantial genetic diversity. HRVB infection was associated with more severe disease in univariate analyses. Maternal atopy and asthma were associated with more severe infant HRV-associated illnesses. This finding suggests that there are underlying susceptibility factors for HRV-associated illness severity that are strongly linked with asthma susceptibility. Because HRV is the virus most commonly associated with acute asthma exacerbations in children, future reports from this cohort as longer-term outcomes, such as recurrent wheezing and asthma, are identified will help to clarify the complex relationship between host susceptibility and HRV infection.Clinical implicationsMaternal atopy is a risk factor for severe rhinovirus-associated illness in infants, suggesting that there are underlying susceptibility factors for HRV-associated illness severity that are strongly linked with asthma susceptibility.\n",
