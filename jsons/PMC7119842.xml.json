            "text": "Immunohistochemistry is a useful technique for characterisation of immune system cells in tissues in pathogenic studies of diseases in humans and animals. Many antibodies have been developed that recognise cell populations in lymphoid organs, but the majority of them work only on frozen sections (Bianchi et al., 1992, Haverson et al., 1994, Denham et al., 1998). In such sections, the evaluation of morphological details is more difficult than in paraffin-embedded sections (Falk et al., 1994). For this reason, detailed studies of the distribution of the different cell populations in the swine immune system are hampered by the lack of antibodies that allow the detection of these cells in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The cross-reactivity of some antibodies to human differentiation markers has allowed immunostaining of a few swine immune cell populations with protocols standardised in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Cross-reacting polyclonal anti-human CD3 antibody is considered an excellent marker for swine T lymphocytes when used on paraffin sections (Mason et al., 1989). The identification of B lymphocytes is a more complex issue. Antibodies against several molecules, such as immunoglobulins (Ramos et al., 1992), CDw75, CD79\u03b1, CD79\u03b2 and HLA-DR have been tested (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996). Among all these molecules, CD79\u03b1 is one of the two polypeptide chains forming the CD79 molecule that is to say without the \u03b1, which has been considered the B cell equivalent of CD3 (Mason et al., 1995). In swine, mAb anti-CD79\u03b1 has been described as a useful pan-B marker, in paraffin-embedded tissue, although it also stains cells of non-lymphoid origin (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996). More recently, a mAb to the largest isoform of porcine CD45 (clon 3C3/9, Bullido et al., 1997a) has been used for phenotypic and functional analyses of porcine lymphocyte subpopulations. The 3C3/9 antibody recognises all B lymphocytes and a subpopulation of T lymphocytes, and it has been applied only in frozen sections (Bullido et al., 1997a).",

Previously described protocols were used for CD3, CD79\u03b1 (Tanimoto and Ohtsuki, 1996), Mac 387 and lysozyme (Evensen, 1993) immunostaining, whereas standardisation of the protocols had to be carried out for 3C3/9 and BL2H5 antibodies. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinised with xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with hydrogen peroxide 3% in distilled water for 30 min. After pronase, trypsin or microwave treatment, depending on the antibody used (see Table 1), tissue sections were rinsed in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (pH=7.6) and incubated with 20% normal goat serum solution in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Titration experiments were carried out to obtain the optimal dilution for the different antibodies. All antibodies were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse (1/200) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (1/400) were used as secondary antibodies, for 1 h at room temperature. An ABC complex (Pierce, IL) diluted 1/100 in 0.1 Tris-buffered saline was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were finally incubated in diaminobenzidine (DAB)\u2013hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min, counterstained with Harris\u2019s haematoxylin, dehydrated, covered with a coverslip and examined microscopically. As negative controls, irrelevant primary antibodies at the same dilution were used in substitution of the specific antibodies.",
