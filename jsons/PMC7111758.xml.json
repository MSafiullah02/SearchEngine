The importance of these compounds lies in their biological activities, especially antiviral [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Three compounds of this class have already became commercially available drugs: cidofovir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients; adefovir in its prodrug form adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV); and tenofovir, either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or more recently (since 2015) also as a new prodrug form tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections [5]. The introduction of tenofovir to the market had a crucial influence on the transformation of HIV/AIDS from a mortal threat to a manageable chronic disease [6]. Besides, long-term systematic investigation of ANPs has enabled the development of many other therapeutically promising structures, which have been synthesised but have never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations. Among others, this concerns fluorinated purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives [7] and acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety [[8], [9], [10]].",

            "text": "5-Azacytosine ANPs were originally synthesised with the aim to search for new epigenetic (hypomethylating) agents; contrary to 5-azacytosine nucleosides (azacitidine, decitabine), however, this activity has not been found. It is evident that the presence of the sugar moiety is essential for this effect [11]. On the other hand, we found a new class of antiviral agents selective against DNA viruses. The lead compound of this group is 5-azacytosine analogue of cidofovir, 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine, HPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 1\n). In comparison with cidofovir, its antiviral activity data are similar, but the toxicity profile is more favourable, with the selectivity index (the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) to the 50% effective concentration (EC50)) being 2- to 16-fold higher than that of cidofovir [8]. The antiviral activity of HPMP-5-azaC has been increased many times by the transformation to ester prodrugs derived from its cyclic form [9]. The only disadvantage of HPMP-5-azaC is its rather complicated metabolic profile caused by its chemical (and also enzymatic) instability [12,13]. Therefore, the compound was finally not advanced to the stage of clinical investigations. Other 5-azacytosine ANPs have better stability but they are either inactive or their antiviral activity is only marginal. Interestingly, some of them, e.g. 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl derivative exhibited antiviral activity when converted into appropriate prodrugs [10].",

            "text": "In this study, we investigate a new type of 5-azacytosine ANPs modified with fluorine at the acyclic part. Fluorinated derivatives, especially nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are compounds of great interest [14]. An introduction of the fluorine atom into biologically active molecules often leads to remarkable changes in their physical, biological, and pharmacokinetic properties due to its electronegativity, size, omniphobicity or lipophilicity and electrostatic interactions [15]. In clinical practice, fluorinated nucleosides are utilised as effective cytostatics (e.g. gemcitabine) or antivirals (trifluridine, sofosbuvir) [16,17]. Within the group of ANPs, 3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl (FPMP) derivatives have been identified as potent and selective inhibitors of retroviruses. The adenine derivative, (S)-9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] adenine, ((S)-FPMPA) exhibits even better in vivo anti-HIV and anti-HBV parameters than adefovir. The activity against HIV is also known for both enantiomers of 9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (FPMPDAP) and its guanine counterpart [7,18]. Structures of these compounds are depicted in Fig. 2\n.",

The usual way to overcome this problem is the transformation of such compounds to appropriate prodrugs. The most frequently used ANP prodrugs are acyloxyalkyl (pivaloyloxymethyl, POM), alkyloxyalkyl, S-acylthioethyl (SATE), aryl, cyclic 1-aryl-1,3-propanyl and cyclosaligenyl phophonate esters, phosphoramidates bearing amino acid esters and proTides [19]. Despite promising in vitro or in vivo studies, only a few of them have been proceeded into clinical trials. This can be attributed to the difficulty of the achievement of the right prodrug property balance, in particular suitable chemical stability, rate of conversion, safety with respect to by-products, the avoidance of stereoisomers, adequate physical properties (the ability to crystallise, solubility), and the ability to synthesize substantial quantities. The synthesis of ANP prodrugs and the investigation of their pharmacological properties have been the subject of many reviews [20,21].",

The synthon approach has already been reported for the preparation of purine FPMP derivatives by Jindrich et al. [22] Their synthesis started from protected 5\u2032-O-ribonolactone and included as many as nine reaction steps. Another, more efficient synthesis of FPMP synthons utilises enantiomeric fluorohydrines accessible from commercially available O-tritylated glycidols by reaction with potassium hydrogen difluoride [23]. In our present work, we have investigated the fluorination of (R)-3-benzyloxy-2-[(diisopropylphosphoryl)methoxy)]propanol (3), a compound utilised in our laboratory as a common starting material for the preparation of 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl derivatives.

Unlike various strongly corrosive reagents, e.g. DAST or deoxofluor, perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride is stable, only little moisture-sensitive and easy to handle. Its use for the direct fluorination of ANPs is known only from for several examples. In the above mentioned FPMPT synthesis, the appropriate starting material was the 3-hydroxy-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivative of 4-O-methoxy-5-methylpyrimidinone (not thymine). The reason is that these fluorinations are sensitive to the presence of acidic hydrogen atoms in the starting molecule. For example, the performance of the same reaction with the diisopropyl ester of HPMPT (containing NH at the position 3 of the thymine moiety), results in elimination under basic conditions resulting in a six-membered ring closure through the side-chain hydroxy group [29]. Similarly, this fluorination method also fails with cytosine derivatives (HPMPC).",

The reaction with NEP had been reported to provide better results in the syntheses of fluorinated nucleosides [32], but the preparation of our FPMP precursor proceeded satisfactory using DBU. The reaction was carried out in toluene, initially at room temperature. Although the yields of 5 were 42\u201350% the reaction rate was slow. A significant decrease of reaction time was achieved by heating to 90 \u00b0C. Full conversion was observed when DBU was added for a few hours (3\u20134 h). The course of fluorination reaction with NEP was worse and required excess of perfluorobutanesulphonyl fluoride (90% conversion after 9 h). The final FPMP synthon, (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulphonate (1), was obtained from 5 by the removal of a benzyl group via catalytic hydrogenation to give intermediate 6 which was further subjected to tosylation (Scheme 1).",

Reaction afforded a mixture of N\n1 and O\n2 regioisomers 8a and 8b, whose ratio depended on the reaction time (Scheme 2\n).

This instability is caused by the electron deficiency in position 6 of the triazine ring, where the imine-resembling carbon could be easily attacked by a nucleophile, e.g. an hydroxyl ion, accompanied by the cleavage of the ring [11,12]. On the other hand, the conversion of 5-azacytosine compounds into their 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine counterparts with sp3-hybridisied carbon (CH2) at the position 6, leads to the compounds which are hydrolytically stable. Nucleosides modified in this way, e.g. 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and 2\u2032-deoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine, still preserve their antitumor and hypomethylating activities. They are lower in comparison with the original 5-azacytosine derivatives but the compounds are less toxic [11,34]. In the field of ANPs, we previously reported the 5,6-dihydro derivative of HPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 1). The compound has preserved its anti-DNA virus activity (albeit lower than HPMP-5-azaC); nevertheless in contrast to HPMP-5-azaC, it also exhibits inhibitory activity against HCV replication, and is hydrolytically stable [8].",

The usual way using bromotrimethylsilane completely failed, leading to a mixture of decomposition products. Another possibility was a microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. This method of the transformation of phosphonate esters to free ANPs has been originally developed at the IOCB by Jansa and Hol\u00fd. This method is usually very clean and the isolation of products is easy [35,36]. In our experiments, we hydrolysed 15a-c with two equivalents of HCl at 150 \u00b0C for 5\u201315 min under micro-wave irradiation. Unfortunately, the ring of the triazine moiety opened and the C-6 methylene group was hydrolytically split off. This indicated the destabilisation of the 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine ring as a consequence of imidazole-triazine annelation. On the other hand, we had observed earlier that 5-azacytosine ANPs can have better stability in the cases when their phosphonic function is masked by an appropriate prodrug group [9,11,37]. Taking into account this finding, we selected another synthetic strategy starting from bis(amidate) prodrug of FPMP-5-azaC 11. Compound 11 can be easily reduced to the corresponding 5,6-dihydro form 18 which is then subjected to condensation reaction with 2-bromoacetophenones to form the desired annelated structures 19a-c in their prodrug forms (Scheme 6\n). The other way, Jansa's method [33] for the transformation of phosphonate ester 12 into phosphoramidate 18 doesn't take place. This may have been caused by the presence of acetic acid in the structure of 12. Condensation reactions using 2,2\u2032-dipyridyldisulphide (Aldrithiol) and triphenylphosphine are known to proceed via a cyclic intermediate whose formation requires a proton coming from a nucleophile [38] (e.g. amino acid ester). It is possible that acetic acid preferentially protonates a pyridine unit of 2-thiopyridine which then cannot activate a nucleophile and phosphonate units.",

While none of the compounds showed any activity against RNA viruses, compounds 8a and 22 were able to inhibit, albeit weakly, the replication of herpesviruses (Table 1\n). The FPMP-5-azaC diisopropyl ester (8a) inhibited the replication of HCMV with EC50 values that were about three times higher than those of the reference anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir without displaying cytotoxicity for HEL cells up to the highest concentration tested (100 \u03bcM). The compound 8a proved significantly less active against wild-type strains of HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV than the reference drug acyclovir but was in contrast to acyclovir remained active against TK-deficient viruses. This derivative proved inactive against other DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus (poxvirus) and adenoviruses.

The reactions were performed in a high-pressure test tube (10 mL), equipped with a septum and a magnetic stirrer. Reaction time was modified according to the rate of conversion of the starting esters. IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR Spectrometer Bruker IFS 55 (Equinox) in KBr, CCl4 and CHCl3. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance 600 III HD and Bruker Avance 500 III HD spectrometers operating at 600.1 and 500.0 MHz for 1H and 150.9 and 125.7 MHz for 13C, respectively. 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 III HD or Bruker Avance 400 III HD operating at 202.3 or 162.0 MHz, respectively. 19F NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 III HD operating at 470.3 MHz.
