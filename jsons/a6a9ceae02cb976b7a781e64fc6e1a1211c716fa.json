Briefly, the two IR images (TI-high and TI-low) were identically scaled and divided (TI-high/TI-low). Since the imaging parameters were held constant (except for TI) and images scaled equivalently, the ratio of intensity values (intensity-ratio) in each pixel was related to T 1 by intensity-ratio \u03ed (1 \u03ea 2exp(\u03eaTI high /T 1 ))/ (1 \u03ea 2exp(\u03eaTI low /T 1 )) (4) where TI high and TI low represent the TIs used in each image.

A constant value of \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) over time existed at both 1.5T and 3T, which confirms the fast-exchange assumption by showing a steady-state distribution of the contrast agent between blood and myocardium compartments. \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) did not differ significantly between single and double doses (1.5T (single and double): 0.49 \u03ee .05 and 0.44 \u03ee .06; 3T (single and double): 0.56 \u03ee .05 and 0.53 \u03ee .07, P \u03fe 0.05). Despite the constant value over time, a large difference in \u232cR 1myo / \u232cR 1blood (t) was observed between 1.5T and 3T (0.46 \u03ee .06 and 0.54 \u03ee .06, P \u03fd 0.10). This implies that there may be a difference in compartmental contrast agent relaxivities (r 1myo and r 1blood ) between field strengths (see Eq. [2] ), assuming that the ratio of compartmental extracellular volumes ( myo ) did not change between 1.5T and 3T.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2096, "end": 2099, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 570, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 750, "end": 758, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1280, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Figure 1."}, {"text": "The major findings of this study were as follows: 1) the T 1 of myocardium was 1.07 \u03ee 0.03 sec at 1.5T and 1.22 \u03ee 5T and 3T decreases following contrast injection, and the decrease is more significant for myocardium than blood. Following contrast injection, the T 1 difference remains relatively constant over time and is insensitive to dose and tissue type. Ten minutes postinjection the T 1 difference decreased 72% for myocardium and 30% for blood. Although there was significant variability in T 1 among subjects, the relaxation times at 3T were still generally greater than 1.5T. 0.07 sec at 3T; 2) the T 1 difference due to field strength (between 1.5T and 3T) was significantly reduced for myocardium, but not for blood, following contrast administration; 3) \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) differed between 1.5T and 3T, suggesting field and tissue dependence of the contrast agent relaxivity; and 4) there was significant inter-subject variability in T 1 postcontrast. In all 10 subjects, the T 1 of myocardium was 1.07 \u03ee 0.03 sec at 1.5T and 1.22 \u03ee 0.07 sec at 3 T, while blood T 1 was 1.58 \u03ee 0.13 sec at 1.5T and 1.66 \u03ee 0.06 sec at 3T. The 3T values found in our study were roughly 8% higher than those reported by Noeske et al (2) (1.55 sec for blood and 1.12 sec for myocardium at 3T), which may reflect the different measurement techniques used. Noeske et al (2) utilized a partially refocused gradient-echo in the steady-state technique (GRASS) to measure T 1 of myocardium and blood; however, they did not specify the segment TR and quantification method used. The T 1 of blood at 1.5T was approximately 15-30% higher in our study compared to previously reported values (1.20 sec (3,27), 1.23 sec (16), 1.38 sec (28), and 1.34 sec (29)), but lower than that observed in a recent study in pigs (1.80 sec (30) ). However, these values may also dependon the measurement technique used. Klein et al (16) and Flacke et al (28) utilized a modified Look-Locker technique that is known to measure T 1 * (31). It is also known that blood T 1 at 1.5T depends strongly on hematocrit (32) , with variations between 1.1-2.0 seconds for Hct variations of 0.6 and 0.2. The b-SSFP readout module used with our method has been shown to be less sensitive to saturation effects than spoiled gradient-echo techniques (e.g., fast lowangle shot (FLASH)) due to the refocusing and reuse of transverse magnetization, which makes the sampling of free M z recovery more accurate in IR experiments (33) . This is because the decay rate of magnetization during b-SSFP readout (E 1 *) is slower than that for FLASH (24, 28, 34) . Because of this transient decay rate, the continuous sampling of the T 1 relaxation curve using either b-SSFP or FLASH requires appropriate correction of the measured T 1 relaxation time, with more significant corrections needed when FLASH is used. Since our technique sampled T 1 with discrete TIs using (relatively) short readout times, the majority of the signal intensity at k y \u03ed 0 evolved from the free IR preceding data acquisition, and thus the measured T 1 was an accurate estimation of the true T 1 . Even so, the accuracy is a function of the applied flip angle and the number of excitations used during data acquisition, especially if a simplistic recovery expression like Eq. [3] is used to map signal intensities to T 1 . It can be shown (by using the full b-SSFP expression (35) ) that the error in estimation of T 1 using IRss is relatively minor (\u03fd7%) over flip angles of 10 -90\u00b0(assuming T 1myo \u03ed 1100 msec, T 2myo \u03ed 50 msec, T 1blood \u03ed 1500 msec, T 2blood \u03ed 250 msec). Furthermore, this measurement technique was assessed on phantoms of varying T 1 values and resulted in accurate measurements compared to reference T 1 values.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1809, "end": 1813, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1905, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2082, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2481, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2596, "text": "(24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2597, "end": 2600, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2604, "text": "34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3296, "end": 3299, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3396, "end": 3400, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The postcontrast T 1 values at 1.5T reported here are comparable to those obtained previously with the Look-Locker method (16) .

The former may be attributed to differences in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), left ventricular ejection fraction, or extracellular volumes among the subjects, while the latter may be due to field inhomogeneities and susceptibility effects. Although imaging procedures were implemented to reduce T 2 * dephasing (short TE), and the dose was identical at both field strengths, it is possible that the concentration of the contrast agent in circulation at any given time point was not the same during both study sessions. A difference in Gd-DTPA-BMA concentration among studies may be related to day-to-day changes in GFR that are largely controlled by food or fluid intake. Large differences in GFR among humans and dogs (37, 38) and over day-to-day periods (38) were recently observed. This degree of variation in postcontrast T 1 measurements in vivo was also observed in previous studies (15, 16) .The ratio \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) at 1.5T was similar to values measured previously by MRI at 1.5T (16) and 2T (5, 15) . These previous reports assumed that myo \u03ed \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t), which implies r 1myo /r 1blood \u03ed 1 (Eq. [2] ). However, in the present study, there was an observable difference in \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) between 1.5T and 3T, which (from Eq. [2] ) suggests there may be some tissue and field dependency of Gd-DTPA-BMA relaxivity (r 1 ). Previous investigations that directly quantified Gd-DTPA relaxivity reported marginal decreases in r 1 in vivo and in vitro at high field strengths (39 -41) . Since explicit contrast agent concentrations were not determined in the present study, the relaxivity of Gd-DTPA-BMA in blood and myocardium (r 1blood and r 1myo , respectively) could not be directly calculated using serial R 1 measurements (Eq. [1] ). The ratio of compartmental relaxivities (r 1myo /r 1blood (t)) is only valid under the conditions of contrast agent steady state, which was confirmed by a constant value for \u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t) over time. Even though Fig. 3 demonstrates this constancy at both 1.5T and 3T, it is apparent that a difference exists for this measure between the two field strengths (P \u03fd 0.10). Using approximate values of fECV \u03ed 0.35 and Hct \u03ed 0.40 (15) , myo \u03ed fECV/(1 -Hct) \u03f7 0.58 in Eq. [2] , making r 1myo /r 1blood approximately 0.80 at 1.5T and 0.93 at 3T. It can be inferred from these data, therefore, that the relaxivity of Gd-DTPA-BMA may be greater in blood than in myocardium (r 1myo /r 1blood (t) \u03fd 1). Similarly, using Eq. [1] , the ratio of \u232cR 1 (t) between 1.5T and 3T can be determined in the same individual for either blood or myocardium to reveal the field dependence of r 1 : \u232cR 1 \u0351t\u0352 1.5T /\u232cR 1 \u0351t\u0352 3T \u03ed r 1.5T /r 3T . It can be shown with this equation that r 1.5T /r 3T is 1.18 \u03ee 0.15 in blood and 1.01 \u03ee 0.10 in myocardium, implying that the relaxivity in blood may decrease with field strength (r 1.5T /r 3T \u03fe 1) while the relaxivity in myocardium remains constant. However, because of the broad range of measured myocardial extracellular volumes (0.25-0.40 (5, 15, 16, 42) ), there will be uncertainty in generalizing r 1myo /r 1blood and r 1.5T / r 3T without precise measurements of Hct or myo .Longer T 1 s will exist at higher fields in a given individual, even after injection of a contrast agent. Thus, for imaging sequences that rely on preparation pulses, such as inversion and saturation recovery, it is simpler to suppress longer T 1 s because the slope of magnetization recovery becomes shallower as it crosses or originates from zero, allowing some leeway in TI selection. However, this may also decrease image contrast if the other tissue of interest is also suppressed. Our results suggest that the possible decrease in blood r 1 seen at 3T would produce lower image contrast between blood and myocardium postcontrast at 3T relative to 1.5T. This may have significance in delayed enhancement imaging at 3T, since image contrast will likely decrease between blood and normal myocardium after normal myocardium is suppressed using IR. However, this may benefit image contrast between enhanced infarct tissue and blood for delineating subendocardial infarcts. Unfortunately, predictions can not be made at this time about the field-dependent behavior of contrast-enhanced infarct tissue.In conclusion, T 1 increased from 1.5T to 3T, and more significantly for myocardium than blood. Following contrast administration, T 1 differences between 1.5T and 3T were obscured by field and contrast agent effects such that there was no significant difference in T 1 between 1.5T and 3T following contrast injection. The ratio of contrast agent distribution (\u232cR 1myo /\u232cR 1blood (t)) exhibited some field dependence, which suggests that contrast agent relaxivity may also be field dependent. These factors may play a role in the reduced T 1 difference observed between 1.5T and 3T.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "(37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 909, "end": 913, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "(15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1154, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1165, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1169, "text": "15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1417, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1665, "text": "(39 -41)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1917, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2357, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2397, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2644, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3188, "end": 3191, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3192, "end": 3195, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3196, "end": 3199, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3203, "text": "42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2141, "end": 2147, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
