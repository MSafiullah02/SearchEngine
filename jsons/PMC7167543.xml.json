The Equality Act 2010 provides it is unlawful to discriminate, either directly or indirectly, on the basis of protected characteristics. Two characteristics relevant to this discussion are age and disability.21 Discrimination on the basis of age or disability occurs if a criterion or practice is applied that would mean a person of a particular age or with a disability will be placed at a particular disadvantage when compared with a person who is not of that age or does not have that disability and it cannot be shown it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.22 The Act applies to the provision of health services in the NHS.23 Enactment of a policy to give preferential access to intensive care on the basis of age or lack of disability appears to be prima facie discrimination. For example, if a policy were implemented that people over the age of 80 with COVID-19 should not be admitted to ICU, people over the age of 80 will be disadvantaged on the basis of their age.",

This means difficult decisions will need to be made, often in a short amount of time, about who should receive the available resources. Age and disability are two factors that may indicate a reduced probability of benefitting from intensive care treatment, both in the short and long term. In the short term because intensive care treatment is less likely to return an older person or a person with other physical impairments back to a state of full health. And in the long term because older people and people with some disabilities may have a reduced life expectancy and so will survive for a shorter period of time even if they are discharged. In light of the reduced short and long term benefits relative to the rest of the population, it may be argued that discriminating on the basis of age and disability is an proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The legitimate aim is maximising the benefit that can be obtained from limited intensive care resources. It may be argued the measure is proportionate because it provides an effective criterion for making fast decisions using objective criteria.",

While maximising benefit derived from limited intensive care resources is a legitimate aim, age or disability based thresholds may not be a proportionate response to achieving this aim. This is because they are not necessary to achieve the aim and the consequences for those not provided treatment are grave. The aim of ensuring the benefits derived from treatments are maximised may be achieved by assessing the likely effectiveness and outcomes for each individual. Whilst age or disability may be indicative at a population level of a reduced benefit, at an individual level they are imprecise and there are a range of other potentially relevant factors. For example, if Bob is 80 and expected to live 5 more years and John is 45 and expected to live 40 years, it may be argued that John should be given priority. But this is only using age as a proxy for what is actually at issue. If John was only expected to live one year longer, it would make sense to prioritise Bob.",

This would not be directly discriminatory because, although age or disability may impact an assessment of the probability of survival, it is the probability of survival that is determinative.

For example, Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) assessments identify reduced quality of life through disability. If an assessment of quality of life was nothing more than an assessment of the level of a person\u2019s disability, then making decisions on this basis would constitute direct discrimination. However, if the assessment could be conducted on some other basis (for example the person\u2019s subjective assessment of their quality of life) or with other relevant factors, it may not necessarily constitute direct discrimination. Ultimately, this would depend on whether it was considered a proportionate, and a measure that overtly devalued the lives of people with disabilities is unlikely to be considered proportionate.",

Indirect discrimination occurs when a criterion or practice would place a person at a comparative disadvantage to someone who did not share the protected characteristic. 28 Decisions made on the basis of life expectancy and quality of life are indirectly discriminatory because older people and people with some disabilities will be placed at a disadvantage if those with a greater life expectancy or greater quality of life are preferred. If this argument is accepted though, it must also be recognised that making assessments on the basis of frailty to determine the probability of survival may equally constitute indirect discrimination. Older people and people with particular disabilities will be assessed as more frail and are less likely to survive COVID-19. While criteria for length of life and quality of life are likely to be prima facie indirect discrimination, so too is the NICE guidance\u2019s probability of survival.",

All three considerations appear to have the same aim, ensuring limited resources are used effectively and efficiently by ensuring the maximum possible benefit is derived. This is plainly a legitimate aim, the NHS is required to allocate resources ethically, efficiently and effectively.29 So are the three considerations proportionate to achieving this aim? In relation to each consideration, the answer may be that it depends on the extent to which they are imposed. For example, in relation to probability of survival, it may be proportionate to prefer a person with a 90% chance of survival over a person with a 5% chance of survival, but it may not be proportionate to prefer to a person with a 40% chance of survival over a person with a 30% chance. In relation to length of life, it may be proportionate to prefer a person who is likely to live 40 years over a person who is likely to live 6 months, but it may not be to prefer a person who is likely to live 10 years over a person who is likely to live 8 years. In relation to quality of life, it may be proportionate to prefer an otherwise healthy person over a minimally conscious or unconscious person, but it may not be proportionate to prefer a person who is blind over one who is not.",

A more nuanced approach to rationing that is aimed at maximising the benefits derived from limited resources would not be discriminatory, provided the focus was on a clinical assessment of the person and the likely benefits they would derive from the treatment. The only criteria that may be unlawful is quality of life.
