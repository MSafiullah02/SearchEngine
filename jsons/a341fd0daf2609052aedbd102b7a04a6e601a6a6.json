These encounters can lead to multiple outcomes from symbiotic homeostasis to mutual annihilation, undergo multiple cycles of latency and lysogeny, and lead to coevolution of the interacting genomes. Such systems pose numerous challenges but also some advantages to modeling, especially in terms of functional, mathematical genome representations. The main challenges for the modeling process start with the conceptual definition of a genome for instance in the case of hostintegrated viral genomes. Furthermore, hardly understood influences of the activity of either genome on the other(s) via direct and indirect mechanisms amplify the needs for a coherent description of genome activity. Finally, genetic and local environmental heterogeneities in both the host's cellular and the pathogen populations need to be considered in multiscale modeling efforts.

Consider a dune, thus a physical object-the dune's physical properties depend entirely on the physical properties of the sand-corn. Using renormalization techniques, it is possible to mathematically describe a dune and investigate its properties under changing conditions (wind, humidity), without considering each sand-corn individually with simple equations such as the original Bagnold formula (Bagnold 1936) . In biology, the physical properties of the molecular assembly such as a chromatin fiber will not only depend on the physical properties of the histones and the DNA, but in addition the histones and thus their the physicochemical properties have evolved under selective pressure acting on the chromatin fiber and its function (Benecke 2003 (Benecke , 2006 B\u00e9cavin et al. 2010 ).

Both processes will heavily rely on the identification and analysis of different biologic networks at different scales. The integration of information, objects, and their dynamics across scales represents the main challenge of systems biology today. Successful integration is the sine qua non requirement to identify and formulate the mapping functions / and f from object space to phenotype space and back.

In what will follow, we will discuss some recent insights into functional genome representations to add a novel layer of investigation to the problem of gene expression regulation, chromatin structural dynamics, and genome structurefunction relationships.

Similarly, AIDS resistance in SIV natural host primates has been formerly believed to be caused by a lack of innate and adaptive immune recognition. This view is currently changing as four independent systems biology driven efforts have investigated in a comparative manner, the transcriptome dynamics in PBMCs and CD4+ cells of natural hosts for SIV as compared to Asian/New World primates that develop AIDS following SIV infection. Indeed, natural hosts just as AIDS progressor species display a rapid and strong innate immune response to SIV infection, and display all signs of successful immune activation (IA). The changes in the gene expression profiles are not only remarkably concordant between different natural hosts such as African Green Monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus) and Sooty Mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), but also comparable in composition and strength to Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta) and Pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina), the latter two being both AIDS progressors (Jacquelin et al. 2009; Bosinger et al. 2009; Favre et al. 2009; Lederer et al. 2009; Rotger et al. 2011) . By systematic comparison of the gene networks indicative of IA between AIDS progressors and non-progressors not only common themes were identified, but also remarkable differences as to the duration of the innate immune response to SIV have been observed (Fig. 2) . Indeed, IA in natural hosts ceases after the acute infection stage, typically after 2-4 weeks, whereas the gene networks driving the IA in AIDS progressors are still found active after the acute phase, and remain so until onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency (Bosinger et al. , 2012 Manches and Bhardwaj 2009; Mir et al. 2011; Brenchley et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2010) .

Two significant differences are observable: (i) C.S. control IA during the chronic phase of infection as opposed to M.M., (ii) C.S. seems more rapid in activating innate immunity than M.M. (Jacquelin et al. 2009 ). Similar differences are found in CD4+ cells from lymph nodes (Jacquelin et al. 2009 ), as well as other, independent studies involving a similar collection of data and different combinations of natural hosts and AIDS progressors (Bosinger et al. 2009; Favre et al. 2009; Lederer et al. 2009; Rotger et al. 2011) . The recently proposed West Coast Model postulates that control of IA in natural hosts is a function of a mechanism reminiscent of kinetic proofreading (Hopfield 1974) .

Currently, a specific search is underway in the different time resolved transcriptome profiles to identify such activators or repressors of either immune attenuation or IA, and which are differentially expressed/regulated in progressors and non-progressors. It will be of general, beyond the HIV field, interest to identify and characterize such activators and repressors which can promote or control chronic IA with obvious impacts for organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders (Rotger et al. 2011; Bosinger et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2010; Ye and Maniatis 2011; Lepelley et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 395, "text": "Harris et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 883, "end": 903, "text": "(Rotger et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 904, "end": 925, "text": "Bosinger et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 926, "end": 945, "text": "Harris et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 946, "end": 967, "text": "Ye and Maniatis 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 968, "end": 989, "text": "Lepelley et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 376, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Control of Chronic Immune Activation in Natural Hosts"}, {"text": "The current generally accepted ideas on the control of IA in natural hosts, thus, postulate a necessary regulatory event (whether positive or negative) specific to either progressors or non-progressors. Thus, a dedicated signaling cascade composed of at least a sensor for a specific attenuation/activation signal, a transcriptional regulator, and a relay unit linking the sensor to the effector. Not only the molecules that are required specifically in either class of species, but also the nature of the specific signal pose a challenge in terms of evolution as an entire signaling pathway is required. Recall also that the signal for instance does not likely originate from the virus. Facing these dilemmas, we have recently formulated an alternate hypothesis for the absence of chronic IA in natural hosts which is based on a dynamic interpretation of the earliest innate sensing events following viral infection ). For the time being, this hypothesis is only modestly carried by direct experimental observations, as the time resolution with which early signaling events are usually studied is at least an order of magnitude above what would be required to directly assess the merits of the proposition. On the other hand, if this hypothesis, which appeals through its simplicity, would turn out to lead to the identification of a novel mechanism controlling long-term IA through early events, it would also define novel possible avenues for HIV vaccine development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Control of Chronic Immune Activation in Natural Hosts"}, {"text": "Kinetic proofreading is a potent mechanism known in molecular discrimination (Hopfield 1974) . Kinetic proofreading is a process in which, through expenditure of additional energy, ligand recognition is split into two or more individual events in order to increase specificity and discriminatory capacity between closely related ligands or interaction partners with modestly different free energies of binding. In a first step, usually coupled to a conformational change in the receptor achieved through the hydrolysis of ATP, a candidate ligand is bound and presented to an independent interaction surface. Only if this second, independent interaction occurs rapidly enough, the recognition is conclusive, otherwise the ligand is released as the receptor snaps back into its original conformation. This mechanism has been studied in great detail theoretically and shown to drastically increase recognition of a bonafide ligand over analog molecules with very similar free energies. The error thereby is reduced beyond the thermodynamic boundsometimes referred to as the specificity paradox upon which Hopfield based his predictions that ribosomes match codons and amino-acid-loaded tRNA anticodons using a kinetic proofreading mechanism. This has later been proved experimentally also for the way that aminoacyl tRNA synthetase operates (Hopfield 1974; Hopfield et al. 1976) . Furthermore, and more relevant to this discussion, T-cell receptors use kinetic proofreading to enhance discrimination of bonafide ligands from closely related molecules to ensure correct signaling (McKeithan 1995) . Finally, some evidence suggests that kinetic proofreading could also be found at the basis of RIG-I or TLR mediated recognition of foreign in innate immunity (Loo and Gale 2011; Liu and Gale 2010; Suthar et al. 2010) . For the sake of argument, let us assume that a strong and immediate innate immune response is not only a first line of defense to gain the required time for setting the stage for adaptive immunity, but that it is also a mechanism to proofread the adaptive immune response. In this scenario, some of the mechanisms of innate immunity would be required to be activated in order to maintain sustained, general IA beyond acute infection. Absence of innate proofreading would then lead to total inactivation of immune function. However, also the exact opposite effect might be at work-innate proofreading is required to attenuate continued IA. We believe that this latter scenario is more likely, and better reflects the general observations made about immunity.

Natural Host, A.P. AIDS Progressor, + present, -absent (many) different innate sensors simultaneously. The multitude of signals acts synergistically to mount the immediate innate IA which in turns triggers adaptive immunity. Maintaining this early response over prolonged periods of time, as observed in AIDS progressors, does not add any advantage to the system, however, is costly in terms of energy expenditure and precludes specific activation of downstream processes. If one of the different innate sensing mechanisms serves as proofreading mechanism, it makes more sense to propose that the proofreading is meant to attenuate the early innate response rather than sustaining or driving it as the latter would be redundant with the other mechanisms. In other words, the proofreading would simply signal that innate IA has been successfully triggered and thus needs to be attenuated in the near future in order to set the stage for adaptive immunity, avoid exhaustion of resources, and redundant signaling without added benefit. Therefore, an innate sensing mechanism that triggers attenuation of IA would represent a simple feedforward control which does not require any additional specific signaling pathways or additional signals in order to be functional (see Goodman et al. 2011) for an interesting example of a feedforward mechanism in viral replication). This appears to be one strong argument in favor of the existence for such a dual purpose innate sensing that acts in one of those two aspects reminiscent of kinetic proofreading.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1271, "end": 1291, "text": "Goodman et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Kinetic Proofreading as a Possible Mechanism for IA Control"}, {"text": "The second interesting argument can be formulated in favor of this hypothesis which is the dynamics of proofreading. As discussed above, through the addition of irreversible (energy consuming) steps prior to and integral part of faithful recognition a delay function is implemented. In other words, every one of the independent irreversible prerecognition steps needs time to complete; and thus the increase in specificity of recognition is not only 'bought' through energy consumption but also accompanied with varying delays between the initial encounter and positive recognition, which are a function of the number of successive prerecognition steps and physical proximity. In this context, the time delay creates a lag-time for the attenuation signal of innate activation which would prevent early shutdown. In other words, not relying on a specific signaling pathway for attenuation creates the problem that innate IA and its attenuation are triggered at the same time leading to conflicting signals. If, however, the attenuation signal is lagging behind because of its increased specificity, a functional feedforward repression is implemented .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Kinetic Proofreading as a Possible Mechanism for IA Control"}, {"text": "Finally, the dynamics of such a proofreading mechanism could potentially also explain the differences observed between natural hosts and AIDS progressors following SIV infection. As a matter of fact, a kinetic proofreading mechanism defines two boundaries on time. First, discussed above, there is a lower bound for the recognition process defined by the delay in time over the one or several irreversible steps. But also a second, upper bound, on time is explicitly part of the mechanism. If the recognition step n is too slow compared to the step n \u00c0 1 the process aborts as unsuccessful. Hence, the execution time for step n is bounded by a function of the off-rate of n \u00c0 1: Practically speaking, the hypothesis presented here suggests that there exists a window of time during which recognition has to occur in order to trigger attenuation of innate IA. This window of time starts with the earliest prerecognition event at t 0 (infection) and continues up to some upper limit s which has to be sufficiently close that robust (a significant fraction of a large number of events) recognition can occur. If this recognition occurs to late, the attenuation signal can no longer be released and IA continues chronically. This is a strong hypothesis which should be verifiable experimentally. Indeed, there even seems evidence in the existing transcriptome profiles for early dynamics playing a key role in the attenuation of IA in natural hosts, and why immune attenuation does not occur in AIDS progressors (Fig. 2) . Indeed, it appears that innate IA occurs more rapidly in the natural host AGM as compared to Rhesus Macaques if the ontology-based inference of the activity of the interferon a pathway is accepted as a proxy (Jacquelin et al. 2009 ). The lower schematic illustrated the two main differences in the activation and attenuation kinetics between the AGMs (green) and the Macaques (red) and also schematizes the window of opportunity (black) for a feedforward attenuation mechanism reminiscent of kinetic proofreading. The threshold g needs to be crossed by the early recognition events before s expires (see above) and too slow IA in the case of AIDS progressors (red), albeit sufficient in amplitude to cross g; fails to do so within the window of opportunity set by the proofreading mechanisms' upper and lower bounds on time. Note that, we assume here that the lower bound is defined by the first encounter with viral particles/components thereof or immediately after, thus is identical for the two species in this experiment, and that the upper bound is a function of the intrinsic lifetime of prerecognition complexes assumed to be identical in both cases as well. Thus, the only variable in the system is the speed with which IA occurs in both species. This can be viewed as analog to the situation of a surfer. If pathogen encounter and innate recognition as foreign is considered a wave at the beach, then IA could be seen as a surfer getting up on his surfboard. If the surfer fails to mount during the window of opportunity (defined by the width of the wave-back, thus intrinsic to the wave), the surfer will sink; thus, the term west coast model used (see Benecke et al. 2012 for a detailed discussion on this argument). Relevance of this model stems from the following observations: SIVinfected NHPs and HIV-infected human AIDS progressors mount their innate immune response too slow or rather too late leading to a non-attenuation and thus chronic IA. This unresolved innate IA wears down the system and leads consequently to decline in CD4+ T-cells, the hallmark of AIDS (Pandrea et al. 2011) .

Four different methods of meta-analysis stemming from two different philosophical approaches were used and compared in their absolute and relative performance. Processed data were either converted to logratios to identify genes that show opposite regulation in HPI and LPI, or directly submitted to meta-analysis by direct comparisons. In previous studies, both targeted and genome-wide approaches have been used to identify particular host pathways deregulated during infection. In parallel, a direct comparison of gene expression in 'high' and 'low' pathogenicity groups was performed. Statistically significantly differentially expressed genes were compiled to result in a characteristic gene signature when comparing the initial 'high' and 'low' groups. The fundamental difference between the three earlier, logratio based methods, and the latter direct comparison signature is the implicit choice of reference gene expression levels as well as the subsequent classifier used to choose signature genes. While the former methods will select for those genes that are uniquely/oppositely regulated in 'high' versus 'low' pathogenicity settings, the latter will select for genes that are statistically significantly differentially expressed between both conditions. The logratio meta-analysis derived signatures could be, in accordance with Sonnenschein et al.

In-depth analysis of the aPS revealed, furthermore, that biologic conditions classified as intermediate between HPI and LPI often belonged in the case of MPI data to late time points after infection, and for HPI data to early time points, leading to an analog immune response model for respiratory virus infection. The aPS derived by comparative meta-analysis of this respiratory virus infection compendium can be, thus, used to correctly classify host transcriptome responses according to clinical pathogenicity. The reason why the aPS outperforms the alternate digital pathogenicity signatures derived through the other three meta-analysis methods is explained by the striking observation of an analog that is continuous and correlated, host gene expression response to pathogenicity. Gene expression of this continuos response can be either positively or negatively correlated with pathogenicity, the latter being only recently recognized to exist (Kash et al. 1918; Cilloniz et al. 2010) .

Furthermore, it will almost nowhere reach sufficient Fig. 3 Two alternate dynamic interpretations of the observed strong correlation between gene expression activity and pathogenicity (Chang et al. 2012) . The uncovered positive and negative correlations between mRNA levels produced from a signature set of genes relevant to respiratory virus infection in mice with the corresponding pathogenicity of the virus (viruses or conditions were attributed to one of three discrete categories 'high', 'medium', and 'low', center) have two possible mechanistic origins. First, as initially proposed by Chang et al. (2012) , while variable in time, a given gene at any given moment will be expressed as a function of viral pathogenicity (left). Second, it is also possible that all the signature genes will share similar expression values independent of the pathogenicity of the virus, in this case, however, at different moments in time (right). These regimes are not necessarily exclusive. Note that with the current resolution of the existing data a direct inference of which of the two regimes actually at work is impossible. Note also that the identification of which of the two mechanisms is at work would lead to strong, testable hypotheses, and provide directions for future experiments aiming at dissecting the gene regulatory network(s) relevant to the viral pathogenicity. The identification of the key regulator(s) driving the effective network and its dynamics were greatly facilitated if one could make a prediction as to the turnover of these regulators (which can be estimated from the time-series data for all genes). Note finally that the regime described on the right-disparity in activation (and symmetrically repression, not illustrated)-resembles the observations made in the case of comparative SIV infection in natural hosts versus AIDS progressors (Sect. 2, Fig. 2 , opening the exciting possibility of a similar, if not identical, phenomenon taking place in both scenarios) density (e.g. recordings of many independent biologic replicates) to allow proper statistics. Moreover, simultaneous observation of all relevant determinants at all relevant scales over time is not possible, the experimental data will remain independent observations. Statistics on those will not enable to construct causal links rather than correlations between them. Furthermore, standard statistics is inappropriate for the questions posed since biologic processes are not generic, and arguments of parsimony, typicality, and natural chance of occurrence fail. Finally, statistical descriptions per se do not provide causal relationships, and hence do not provide comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.

Comprehension, or at least the possibility of inference of networks and their dynamics over multiple scales is likely a prerequisite to targeting multifactorial diseases such as cancer, genetic disorders, or pathogen-induced malignancies. The examples discussed above illustrate well the limitations of current methodologies at hand. Let us, thus, first recapitulate the main features which need to be captured by mathematical (or functional) genome representation: a genome (i) codes for a number of molecular machines that catalyze elementary biochemical reactions, and (ii) has evolved to orchestrate the molecular machines in a manner that whatever form the organism takes in response to external or internal stimuli the organism remains alive (Benecke 2006) . This seemingly trivial concept that any transitions from one functional (active) form of the genome/organism to another can only happen at the condition that any intermediate represents a viable genome/organism needs to be exploited as it is the strongest constraint on the system. The true 'miracle' does not lie within the elementary machines but within the fact that they self-organize across different time and space scales into a functional form whether it be at an embryonic or an adult state (Smet-Nocca et al. 2010) . It is the rules of interaction (direct or indirect) that are at the essence of the genome. These rules of interaction are coded in the genome at its sequence level, but also on the level of its structural and spatial dynamics (for instance: activitydependent subnuclear localization, or localization-dependent activity). Thereby, any elementary information in the genome (such as a single nucleotide) has a role (even seemingly negligible) of coding for any part of the functional forms of the genome at different time and space scales (Benecke 2006) . The functional forms of a genome are thus expressed through nonzero contributions (weights) from individual elements which interact within a highly constrained, hence rigid structure. Note that from a computational viewpoint, an active genome is presumably a universal Turing machine (Benecke 2006) . Recently, an initial proposition for a mathematical representation has been made where nucleotide frequencies as well as measurements on the activity of any part of the genome under defined biologic conditions are simultaneously expressed as probability distributions (Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b) . This mathematical structure allows, which yet also has some questionable properties, see below, allows to introduce concepts from algebraic geometry for data analysis and modeling. We thereby use three independent paradigm shifts which lead to a modified approach to the inference problem in functional genomics (Benecke 2008 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1020, "text": "(Benecke 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1546, "text": "(Smet-Nocca et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2099, "text": "(Benecke 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2386, "end": 2400, "text": "(Benecke 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2671, "end": 2699, "text": "(Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3027, "text": "(Benecke 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An Emerging Proposition for a Mathematical Genome Structure"}, {"text": "A genome is currently represented as a string composed of a four to six (DNA methylation, gaps) letter alphabet. Most approaches consist of identifying meaningful 'words' within this text, often by trying to identify over-represented subsequences that coincide with measurable quantities or changing quantities such as a gene, the amount of RNA transcribed from a gene, or the presence of a gene regulatory factor or particular chromatin modifications associated with the studied process in a given biologic condition. The genomic sequences obtained over the past decade reveal a low complexity of the genomic sequence, especially in non-coding regions, and consequently high-fidelity statistical inference of functional elements is essentially limited to protein coding sequences which account for only % 2 % of the total human genomic sequence. Paradoxically, even what was considered to be a well-defined concept, the notion of a gene, is being challenged by the recent discovery of short and long, untranslated RNA sequences (microRNAs, ncRNAs), and the discovery of increasingly complex patterns of alternate promoter and splice-site usage. The concept of probability landscapes replaces the one-dimensional view of a genome by a stacked structure over genome positions, where the stack contains the representation of all biologic objects and events relative to the position n along the genome (Fig. 4) . This mathematical structure gives at the same time the framework to analyze data, to reconstruct missing information using rigidity-like and coherence arguments, and to express inherently multiscale causal relationships that can be used to explain genome function. Mathematical does not mean abstract, since on the contrary any set of experimental data or concrete interactions are transformable into the probability distributions (Lesne and Benecke 2008a) . In turn, the probability distributions used allow the inference of a more integrated knowledge without having to prescribe all local properties and connected relationships. Rather than considering individual states of an active genome, probabilities describe the relevance of any object mappable to the genome (for instance: physical properties of chromatin, or transcription factor binding) to these states (Lesne and Benecke 2008a) . As any relevant information on all levels, features (objects such as genes, regulatory sequences), and experimental data can be expressed as probabilities, a unified representation is obtained. The ensemble of probability distributions at site n constitute the stack and horizontally, thus over all positions n i ; a profile. Finally, rather than focusing on objects and states (or their probabilities) the aim of this form of representation is to be able to access the transformations between the probability distributions that govern their mechanistic, biologic relations. The set of transformations thereby constitutes the mapping functions f and U from Fig. 1 for the phenotypes associated with genome activity provided sufficient data have been integrated. Genome Position n+3 Fig. 4 Probability landscapes, which include as reference set the probabilistic representation of the genomic sequence obtained from several to many individuals, can be used to discover and analyze longitudinal correlations efficiently among the initially heterogeneous and unrelatable descriptions and genome-wide measurements. The structure consists of probability density distributions stacked on any genome position n defining the vertical extension. Horizontally, along the one-dimensional genome, a layer is generated for every biologic condition and every experimental measure. In this schematic representation, the probability distributions for two measures of activity of two different viruses over a five base genome is illustrated (Lesne and Benecke 2008) . These profiles than can be integrated vertically (schematized on the right) using appropriate formalisms. A large collection of such geometric and algebraic ways to generate what is here referred to as joint profile exist (Lesne and Benecke 2008) Probability landscapes provide, thus, a unified structure consisting of probabilities \u00f0P n \u00de n and associated quality estimates \u00f0P P n \u00de n -in the form of functional probability densities (probabilities of probabilities)-to integrate any type of relevant genomic information into a coherent annotation. Most importantly, genomic sequence itself, its annotation with empirically derived features such as genes and regulatory sites, and any type of functional genomics data can be described in this manner. The rationale of this probabilistic description is not necessarily to account for an underlying stochasticity, though for some biologic processes this is indeed relevant, but rather to provide an efficient way to formulate partial knowledge and turn relative data of very heterogeneous nature and origin into absolute values and a homogeneous representation of the initial observations. Genome probability landscapes are systematic as any type of relevant information can be correctly and sensibly projected upon the genome positions. This projection has a single nucleotide resolution, producing a (at least locally) continuous profile. The proposed framework is coherent, as any information is converted without exception into the very same structure: probabilities with associated probability densities for local quality estimation. While the proposed representation of information is far from optimal in terms of compression, it provides a direct, systematic, and coherent interface for analysis, thus rendering numerical calculation efficient. The systematic nature of genome probability landscapes and their coherent structure allows easy exchange of information between different research teams. The simple structure of the resulting data also makes the framework easily portable between different computing environments as there is no real need for a solid database structure to generate, store, and handle the information provided that the same metrics are used to generate the profiles. Note that this aspect is a little oversimplification, as using the same metrics is not trivial when all aspects of quality control of the raw data, missing value imputations, and normalization have to be considered. It also appears that the concept is future compatible, as any type of relevant information can also be included in the very same manner into the existing landscapes (we disregard here whether or not this information makes previous data obsolete). This latter point is certainly of heightened interest giving the speed at which technology is developing for instance with respect to 'deep'/ next generation-sequencing (NGS) and digital PCR. A structure that thus can meaningfully combine 'old' e.g., microarray type of data with 'new' NGS data will reduce the requirement for rerunning the same biologic conditions with the latest technology. Finally, the proposition to use probability landscapes for the integration of such data is-as it is inspired by and organized along the DNA sequence-a natural solution. Importantly, probability profiles can also accommodate the description of physical properties of DNA (for instance bending and intrinsic curvature) and chromatin fiber (local elastic constants, compactness), as well as the conformation of its nucleosomes and topologic constraints (conserved linking number within a loop); all these features are expected to play a key role in for instance transcriptional regulation (Widom 1998; Lesne and Victor 2006; Lesne and Benecke 2008a) .

In the toy example given in Fig. 4 , one might for instance want to ask whether it is necessary to consider the activity profiles of Virus*1 and Virus*2 as distinct or whether it is more meaningful to pool them. In other words, does the profile of Virus*1 when jointly considered with the one of Virus*2 provide independent information which needs to be considered or can the one be used to rather back the other? To answer, a measure called Kullback-Leibler divergence (Kullback and Leibler 1951) can be employed to measure the relative contribution of either activity profile to the joint profile. Each individual profile's weight to the combined measure is obtained using the average presumed frequency of these subsets (rather subpopulations). This amounts to one example of a vertical comparison which can be performed along the genome. Then, a longitudinal integration of the local divergencies is performed along genome regions of relevance (e.g. over the location associated to a given gene) allowing to analyze the feature divergence profile of a biologic condition over the entire genome or defined intervals. This genome-wide distance measure is meaningful, unlike the individual feature profiles. If the conditioning by any combination of individual or averaged profiles leads to a statistically significant divergence (suggesting that the associated subpopulation is well delineated and has a specific signature) the profile is kept as a separate entity. In contrast, if statistical significance is not reached, the condition is considered non-pertinent to the biologic question posed as it does not provide a measurable constraint on the value of the joint profile and can be combined with any other statistically insignificant conditions. This process, thus, integrates and thereby collapses part of the landscape to restrict to statistically divergent information (whether this is also biologic meaningful information can not be determined at this stage). Two advantages arise in this case: (i) the complexity of the structure is reduced in a controlled manner in so far as it is irrelevant to the biologic question investigated, and (ii) the statistical power of the joint probability profile is increased. As shown in Lesne and Benecke (2008b) , this procedure can be performed at any interesting scale or functional level and thus the probability landscape over the genomic sequence can be reduced in complexity until all remaining context-dependencies reach statistical significance at which an optimum for computational complexity and statistical power is reached. Different biologic conditions can thereby be defined with maximum flexibility using separate or overlapping subsets of subconditions in a hierarchical manner. The Kullback-Leibler divergence-based method discussed in Lesne and Benecke (2008b) represents, thus, a systematic and simple way of testing the statistical limits of complexity reduction and hence explanatory power of the integrative genomics data in their respective contexts. Note that since we are comparing the distributions of the same random variable under different conditions, it is only the distance (or divergence) between the two distributions that is meaningful. A joint probability, such as mutual information, could not be envisioned. This also holds for the case of two different variables because the joint probability distribution is inaccessible. From a general perspective, our method represents an application of concepts related to context trees to the probability landscape idea. Context analysis and landscape collapse thereby operate in similar manners to Markov chains with variable length for the analysis of time-series and historic context (B\u00fchlmann and Wyner 1999; Maubourguet et al. 2008) . We also note that the Kullback-Leibler divergence calculation provides measures that can be used directly for clustering of probability profiles. Clustering of probability profiles might help to establish and analyze relatedness among data otherwise not compared directly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 435, "text": "(Lesne and Benecke 2008b", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 909, "end": 936, "text": "(Kullback and Leibler 1951)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2700, "text": "Lesne and Benecke (2008b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3242, "end": 3267, "text": "Lesne and Benecke (2008b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4153, "end": 4178, "text": "(B\u00fchlmann and Wyner 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4179, "end": 4203, "text": "Maubourguet et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 473, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "P-Landscape Based Analysis"}, {"text": "As discussed earlier (Sect. 1), the successful integration of time over scales is one of the current bottlenecks of a systems biology description aiming at a discovery mechanism for mapping functions between objects and phenotypes. The two cited examples from virology (Sects. 2, 3) underline the potentially crucial importance of molecular dynamics and their coupling to macroscopic behavior. There are two different possibilities to incorporate time into probability landscapes. First, explicit integration using which will be based on directly using the different time points from the kinetic, to stay within the perimeter of the examples from above, transcriptome profiles to generate individual probability profiles now depend on time: P \u00f0Virus 1\u00de n \u00f0t\u00de (probability to observe activity of Virus 1 in the experimental condition at site n and time t). It is then possible, generalizing the methodology developed for single time P-landscapes to compare those using for instance the Kullback-Leibler formalism, to align profiles from different biologic conditions (Virus*1 vs. Virus*2) using mutual information optimization to determine a local or global shift (compare Fig. 2) , and finally fit a model of the evolution over time using a stochastic operator.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1172, "end": 1179, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Expressing Time in P-Landscapes"}, {"text": "Alternatively, time might be captured only abstractly, and thus indirectly. Consider once more, the schematized behavior of the respiratory virus induced host response signature from Fig. 3 . Whatever the interpretation of the experimentally measured result (center), thus whatever the underlying mechanism (rapid or slow turnover of key regulator) in both scenarios a density (here: pathogenicity) function over time is at the origin of the measured result. As discussed above, probability density distributions are at the basis of the P-profiles generated from the to-be-annotated data. While so far only symmetric distributions have been described and studied (Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b) , the formalism does not exclude the use of skewed, nontrivial distributions (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, distance or divergence measures for skewed distributions, or parts thereof, can be defined. Thus instead of describing variability across individual measurements or different genetic backgrounds, the P P n part of the probability annotation would capture a generalized evolution over time. In this manner, only a single profile would be created for the entire time-series where the actual number of measured discrete time points is replaced by a continuously modeled distribution. Those distributions then can be studied in a fashion similarly as to what has been briefly discussed in Sect. 4 and in more detail in Lesne and Benecke (2008b) . Again, a number of different ways to achieve such integration have been proposed (Selinger 2012) . Indeed, in the example of the respiratory virus infection (Sect. 3), the proposed integration mechanism provides a means of discerning which one is the more likely of the two possible mechanisms, and thus prioritize the experimentally testable hypotheses. (Lesne and Benecke 2008a, b) . Both proposed mechanism (rapid or slow turnover of key regulator) which would lead to the remarkable correlation (and anti-correlation) between the expression levels of key signature genes for respiratory virus infection as a function of the pathogenicity of the analyzed virus lead to density distributions of gene activity with respect to time. These density distributions are characteristic for the virus and can be expressed as probability profiles along the host genome (here illustrated for a single genome position, which might be as discussed in Sect. 3, either indeed a single nucleotide or a consecutive stretch of the genome associated to a measured activity-simplest example would be the difference of resolution of NGS vs. microarray based transcriptomics).
