The most extreme consequence of mental instability can result in suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and actual suicide (Jahan et al., 2020; Mamun & Griffiths, 2020b) . Like previous pandemics (e.g., 2002 SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome; Cheung et al., 2008] ), the present COVID-19 pandemic appears to be leading to higher suicidality.",

For a small minority, this becomes so unbearable that suicide becomes the only option. The reasons for COVID-19-related suicides are multifaceted and include the fear of infection, money problems as a result of the financial and economic recession associated with national lockdowns, being harassed or victimized by others because individuals have (or are thought to have) COVID-19, and the stress of being in isolation or quarantine (Dsouza et al., 2020; Goyal et al., 2020; Mamun & Griffiths, 2020a; Mamun & Ullah, 2020; Thakur & Jain, 2020) .

However, there are other types of suicide pacts including two or more people who commit suicide together on the internet because they do not want to die alone (Ozawa-de Silva, 2008) . Previous findings indicate that the majority of suicide pact victims are married, socially isolated, with a serious physical illness in one or both partners (Part et al., 2013) . Research has also indicated the most common reasons for couples committing suicide together (particularly in Western countries) include health problems, external pre-marriage relationship complexities, social isolation, being unable to have children, psychological disorders, and financial difficulty. In Eastern countries, one of the most common reasons for suicide pacts among couples is among young couples whose parents refuse to let the couple get married (Milin & Turgay, 1990; Part et al., 2013; Pridmore & Reddy, 2010) .",

While existing health facilities are prioritizing the medical treatment of individuals with COVID-19, the resources to treat the subsequent and related psychological effects are arguably insufficient. While the consequences of the physical infection can be seen, the psychological effects are often not seen until it is too late. Given the fact there is no vaccine for treating COVID-19, no-one can be sure when the pandemic will end. This in itself can be a psychological stressor that may lead to more COVID-19-related suicides and suicide pacts. Relevant public mental health strategies are therefore needed (see Mamun & Griffiths, 2020a) should be adopted as soon as possible to minimize further suicides.",
