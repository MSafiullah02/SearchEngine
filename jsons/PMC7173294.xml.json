The disease was first reported in England in 1971 [2]. Subsequently, the disease has spread to Europe and most of the Asian swine raising countries, and severely affected swine industry especially in Asia [3], [4]. During years 2010\u20132015, PED outbreaks with more severe clinical symptoms caused by new variant strains have been reported in China, the United States, South Korea and many other swine raising countries, causing substantial economic losses in the global swine industry [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Therefore, development of effective control measurements, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs, are urgently needed to combat newly emerged variant strains in PEDV-vulnerable countries.",

The virus has an approximately 28 kb in length, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [14]. The virus possesses four structural proteins including 150\u2013220 kDa spike (S) glycoprotein, 7 kDa envelope protein, 20\u201330 kDa membrane protein and 58 kDa nucleocapsid proteins [15]. The PEDV S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein which can be divided into S1 (aa 1-789) and S2 (aa 790-1383) domains [16]. The former is responsible for the cellular receptor binding and the latter is required for membrane fusion of the virus [17]. It has been reported that the C-terminal domain of S1 domain is responsible for binding to the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a functional cellular receptor for PEDV entry [18]. Furthermore, previous studies have also elucidated that like some of the other coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 domain could bind to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor for PEDV [19].",

Subsequently, it has been confirmed that the PEDV CHGD-01 variant strain exhibits stronger sugar-binding activity than the CV777 prototype strain, suggesting that the mutated amino acids may participate in sugar binding, and the authors also proposed that the enhanced sugar-binding activity of the variant strains may be responsible for the recent PED outbreaks [19]. Furthermore, in an indirect ELISA based on NTD (tSc, aa 25-225) of PEDV S1 domain showed positive correlations between OD values of pig sera and virus neutralization titers [20]. Therefore, the NTD of PEDV S1 domain may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against PEDV variant strains.",

In spite of absence of post-translational modification such as glycosylation, expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli has many significant benefits over other expression systems in terms of cost, ease-of-use and scale [25]. However, recombinant protein overexpression in E. coli often leads to the insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs). Although IBs generally consist of biologically inactive proteins, correctly folded soluble proteins can be obtained from IBs by complete denaturation followed by refolding in vitro\n[26]. The purified IBs are commonly solubilized by high concentration of chaotropic agents such as 6 M guanidine hydrochloride or 8 M urea, and refolding of the solubilized protein is initiated by removal of denaturants either by dialysis or dilution [27]. Finally, the refolded proteins can be purified by various chromatographic purification steps.",

Approximately 30% of the total cell protein was S25-229. The expressed recombinant S25-229 was detected by western blot using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B). In addition, western blot result showed an extra band of \u223c50 kDa within the insoluble fractions, which suggests the formation of dimers of S25-229 (Fig. 1B, dotted arrow).

In this study, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 8 M urea was initially used to solubilize the S25-229 IBs, but the solubilization efficiency was only 21% even in the presence of 8 M urea (Table 1\n). It has been reported that solubilization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) IBs was pH-dependent even in the presence of 8 M urea [29]. Therefore, we decided to check the role of pH on the solubilization efficiency of S25-229 IBs. As the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of S25-229 was determined as 8.87, optimization experiments were carried out using solubilization buffers with pH values of <7.5. As shown in Table 1, the solubilization efficiency was improved from 21% to 81% as pH lowered from 7.5 to 4.5.",

Indeed, previous studies have achieved one-step chromatographic purification of various recombinant proteins, such as ovalbumin, human growth hormone and human granulocyte colony stimulating factor [31], [32], [33]. In this study, refolded S25-229 was purified by strong cation exchange chromatography using HiTrap SP FF column on a FPLC \u00c4KTA explorer 10 chromatography system (Fig. 2\nA).

Purified protein was confirmed by western blot using anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2C). The low yield (23%) of cation exchange chromatography may be partially explained by the multimer formation of this protein. In SDS-PAGE and western blot (Fig. 1), dimeric band is clearly seen. However, this band disappeared after chromatography (Fig. 2B and C). We assumed that anything soluble is folded, structured and stable protein in refolding step. Considering that S25-229 monomer and dimer in Fig. 1C of purified IBs comprises over 80%, 77% loss in chromatography step indicates that refolded S25-229 proteins are soluble but in various structures including dimer and these be removed by tight binding to the column.",

Because our attempt to solubilize purified S25-229 IBs in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 8 M urea showed low solubilization efficiency, the solubilization condition was further optimized. We found that lowering the pH and adding reducing agent were helpful to improve the solubilization efficiency. Subsequently, solubilized S25-229 IBs were refolded by simple dilution method. Refolded S25-229 was purified by one-step cation exchange chromatography with >95% purity and 20% yield. The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 \u03bcg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native S protein of PEDV in an immunofluorescence assay. The results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine for the prevention of PEDV. Moreover, the method presented in this work provides an easy way to produce soluble recombinant S25-229 from bacterial IBs.",
