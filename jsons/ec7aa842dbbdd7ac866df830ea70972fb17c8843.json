            "text": "This trial assessed the efficacy of a commercial essential oil (EO) product on the immune response to vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) and subsequent challenge with virulent ND virus genotype VII (vNDv genotype VII) by using the following experimental groups of broiler chickens (Each group had 21 birds with 3 replicates in each, n 5 7): NC (negative control), PC (positive control), VC (vaccinated), and VTC (vaccinated and treated with EOs). Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preventive or therapeutic measure, 2 additional ND-vaccinated groups were used (PRV: medicated 1 D before vNDv challenge for 5 D; and TTT: medicated 2 D after vNDv challenge for 5 D). In addition, the immune-modulatory effect of EOs on the avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB), and infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC) revealed a lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs, and postmortem lesion score (11) than ND vaccines alone (VC) (52.28% mortality and score 15), in addition to lower hemagglutination inhibition (P , 0.05) (6.5 6 0.46) and viral shedding (10 log 2.28 6 0.24) titres 1 wk after challenge in comparison with VC (8.63 6 0.65 and 10 log 3.29 6 0.72, respectively). Nevertheless, the EOs mixture (VTC) (1952 6 28.82) did not significantly (P . 0.05) improve growth performance compared with the nontreated birds (NC and VC) (1970 6 19.56 and 1904 6 38.66). EOs showed an antiviral effect on vNDv in vivo (in chickens) as a preventive measure (PRV) as well as some therapeutic effect (TTT) through decreasing the viral shedding titres (loNC 0 ), mortality rate, and severity of clinical signs and postmortem lesions, in addition to serum malondialdhyde level. Regarding the other viruses, the EOs mixture did not improve the immune response to the AI and IB vaccines but significantly (P , 0.05) increased the ELISA antibody titre for IBD virus at the 28th D of age (2,108 6 341.05). The studied EOs mixture showed an immune-stimulating response to ND and IBD vaccines, antiviral effect against ND virus, especially if administered before the challenge; however, it did not have a growth-promoting effect.",

            "text": "Avian viral diseases caused by avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB), infectious bursal disease (IBD), and Newcastle disease (ND) viruses are a major obstacle in the poultry industry worldwide and result in substantial economic losses, especially in broilers, due to respiratory distress, high mortality, impaired growth, or immune suppression. Furthermore, they have the capability of inducing diseases independently or in concurrent infection with each other (Roussan et al., 2008) . AI viruses are classified in the genus Influenza virus of Orthomyxoviridae family (Cox et al., 2000) , while the etiology of IBD or Gumboro disease is the IBD virus that is a member of genus Avibirnavirus of the Birnaviridae family (Delmas et al., 2019) . IB virus is belonging to Coronavirus genus of family Coronaviridae 1 (Enjuanes et al., 2000) , while the cause of ND is ND virus, belonging to genus Avulavirus of Paramyxoviridae family (Hines and Miller, 2012) . All these viruses have RNA genome enclosed within either enveloped (AI, IB, and ND viruses) or nonenveloped (IBD virus) capsid. Their outbreaks still occur in the field, although several live, inactivated, or recombinant vaccines are commercially available, and different vaccination programs are applied for each disease (Swayne and King, 2003) . Many factors are related to this problem, and one of them is the immune suppression or an immature immune system (Skowronski et al., 2008) . Moreover, if a virus is endemic in a region, its elimination is difficult, so additional methods are required to combat these viruses along with vaccination. Recently, there has been increased interest in the use of natural antimicrobial agents, and the use of EOs in combination as a strategy to control many pathogens (Gutierrez et al., 2008) . Over 3,000 EOs are known, of which approximately 300 are commercially important and used in the flavour and fragrance industries ( Van de Braak and Leijten, 1999; Baghban-Kanani et al., 2019) . Essential oils are produced by medicinal plants, and their effects vary based on the component, which may have antibacterial (Sokovic et al., 2010; Qorbanpour et al., 2018) , antiviral (Koch et al., 2008; Gado et al., 2019) , anticoccidial (Mohiti-Asli and Ghanaatparast-Rashti, 2015) , antifungal (Pinto et al., 2006) , antioxidant (Nunez et al., 2007) , or growth-promoting effects (Abd El-Hack, 2016 a; . Nevertheless, Reichlinga et al. (2009) concluded in their review that the most tested essential oils exhibited a clear antiviral activity on enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, while they did not affect the nonenveloped viruses. In addition, there are recent studies proving that EOs can improve the cellular and humoral immune responses of chickens (Lee et al., 2011; Roofchaee et al., 2011) . We hypothesized that EOs mixture stimulates immune response to different viral vaccines used in broiler flocks, promotes weight gaining, and can be used to the face the viral outbreaks such as ND virus.",

The penetration mechanism of the virus into the cells determines whether the virus is affected by the EOs or not and where ND virus penetrates cells through a fusion protein (Cermelli et al., 2008) , which in turn can be resistant to EOs (Barbour et al., 2010) , so not all ND viruses are affected by EOs.

The improvement of the clinical and pathological picture of vNDv was observed in PRV (received the EOs supplement that was started from 1 D before the challenge and was continued for 5 D); in addition, this group had the lowest oropharyngeal shedding titre (log 10 ), which could be due to eucalyptus, and it has been used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory tract infections (Cermelli et al., 2008) and may exhibit antiviral activity (Barbour et al., 2010) and thus affects the virulence of the challenge virus. Moreover, EOs showed more protective level against vNDv challenge in PRV (preventive group) than TTT (therapeutic group) that may be attributed to the effect of EOs mixture on ND virus adsorption to cell surface and may block cell receptors resulting in interference with virus binding; its accurate mode of action should be studied through tissue culture.",

In this study, EOs had no significant effect on MDA or SOD in the serum at the 28th D (challenge day), but it caused significant decrease of MDA in PRV and TTT at the 35th D although vNDv challenge did not increase MDA level in PC (positive control). These results make us ask about the role of ND infection on lipid peroxidation and therefore the need for further studies. The decreased level of MDA at the seventh day PC in VTC may be attributed to the antioxidant effect of thyme that is rich in flavonoids (Cook and Samman, 1996) .

EOs did not promote the bird's performance or the immune responses to the AI and IB vaccines; nevertheless, it has an immune-stimulating effect for the IBD virus. Further studies are required for determining their antiviral mode of action to help control different field outbreaks and to decrease viral shedding in addition to vaccination programs.",
