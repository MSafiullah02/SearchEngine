An important component in entity linking approaches is the mention-to-entity prior probability. Even though there is a large number of works in entity linking, the existing approaches do not explicitly consider the time aspect, specifically the temporality of an entity's prior probability. We posit that this prior probability is temporal in nature and affects the performance of entity linking systems. In this paper we systematically study the effect of the prior on the entity linking performance over the temporal validity of both texts and KBs.",

We, on the other hand, take a macroscopic account of time, where perceivably a larger fraction of mention to entity bindings might not be observable in the short time duration but are only evident over a longer period of time, i.e., over a year. These changes might be then reflected in a reference knowledge base and disambiguation methods can produce different results for a given mention at different times.",

In our case the entity's prior probability is directly obtained from the Wikipedia corpus. To calculate entities' probability, we parsed all the articles from a Wikipedia corpus and collected all terms that were inside double square brackets in the Wikipedia articles. [[Andy Kirk (footballer) | Kirk ]] for instance, represents a pair of mention and entity where Kirk is the mention term displayed in the Wikipedia article and Andy Kirk (footballer) is the title of the Wikipedia article corresponding to the real world entity. In this way we created a list of mentions and possible candidate entities according to each Wikipedia snapshot used in this paper. The probability of a certain entity e t given a mention m was only calculated if the entity had a corresponding article inside Wikipedia at time t. Thus, the probability P(e t |m) that a mention m links to a certain entity e t is given by the number of times the mention m links to the entity e t over the number of times that m occurs in the whole corpus at time t. We created dictionaries of mentions and their referring entities ranked by popularity of occurrence for every Wikipedia edition as seen on Table 1 . As an example of mention and its ranked candidate entities, in the KB created from the 2016 Wikipedia edition, the mention Obama refers in 86.15% of the cases to the president Barack Obama, 6.47% to the city Obama, Fukui in Japan, 1.79% to the genus of planarian species Obama (genus), and so on and so forth.",

We can observe Even though it is out of the scope of this work to spot a temporal trend on the entities changes when using knowledge bases from different time periods, we can clearly see there is some temporal variability which is easily observed by the influence on the accuracy calculated over the ground truth datasets. We observe that a simplistic popularity only based method that takes into account reference KB s from different time periods can produce an improvement of 5.4% points in the best case for the ACE04 dataset and 2.0% points in the worst case for MSNBC dataset.",

            "text": "Another observation is the case when an entity mention that was considered unambiguous in the past and became ambiguous in a newer Wikipedia edition due to the addition of new information to Wikipedia. For example in the 2006 Wikipedia edition the mention Al Capone showed a single candidate entity, the north american gangster and businessman Al Capone, while in the newer 2016 Wikipedia edition, the same mention showed more candidate entities, including the former one plus a movie, a song, and other figures with the same name. Moreover, when we take into consideration both the ambiguous and unambiguous mentions, in 9.44% of the cases the mentions change their top ranked candidate entities, whilst when removing the unambiguous mentions this number increases to 15.36%. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the unambiguous mentions keep the same entity bindings, even though we spotted cases of mentions that were unambiguous and became ambiguous in a more recent knowledge base. Top 5 Entities Changes. In another experiment we wanted to calculate the entities rank correlation. One way to calculate rank correlation for lists that do not have all the element in common, is to ignore the non conjoint elements, but unfortunately this approach is not satisfactory since it throws away information. Hence, a more satisfactory approach, as proposed by Fagin et al. [5] , is to treat an element i which appears ranked in list L 1 and does not appear in list L 2 , at position k+1 or beyond, considering L 2 's depth is k. This measure was used to assess the changes in the top 5 candidate entities rank positions. We calculated the rank correlation for 18,727 mentions, since this is the number of mentions that are ambiguous and appears both in the 2006 and 2016 Wikipedia corpus. We normalized our results so the values would lie between [0,1]. Any value close to 0 means total agreement while any value close to 1 means total disagreement. Thus we observed an average value of 0.59 with a variance of 0.05 and a standard deviation of 0.21. We noticed that in 71.98% of the cases the rank correlation values are greater than 0.5. That tells us there is some significant number of changes in the candidate entities' rank's positions. Table 4 shows the mention Watson and its top 5 candidate entities together with their respective prior probabilities extracted from two different Wikipedia editions, one from 2006 and one from 2016.

An entity's prior probability is temporal in nature, and we have observed in our experiments that mention to entity bindings change over time. We could clearly see some temporal variability which should be taken into account for entity linking system's evaluations.
