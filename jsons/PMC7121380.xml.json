            "text": "Plants have provided mankind with useful molecules for centuries. The idea to produce heterologous (exogenous, non-plant) protein in plants to get plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) has been available and rapidly advanced, for just over 30 years (Ma et al. 2003). The first plant-made pharmaceutically relevant protein was the human growth hormone, expressed in transgenic tobacco in 1986 (Barta et al. 1986). Other human proteins have been produced in an increasing variety of plant species and of techniques. In 1989, the expression of the first antibody in tobacco (Hiatt et al. 1989) and, subsequently, the production of the first experimental plant-made vaccine (e.g. hepatitis B virus surface antigen) (Mason et al. 1992) clearly showed that plants had the capability to assemble functional glycoproteins with complex structure. The structural authenticity and preservation of function of plant-produced recombinant proteins was confirmed by the production of more complex antibody derivatives such as the secretory immunoglobulin A (Ma et al. 1995) and new immunogenic proteins (Haq et al. 1995). Also antigenic peptides, expressed as fusions to plant viral coat proteins, were made, and, in many cases, the assembled viral-like particles were demonstrated able to protect animals from the challenge with the pathogen from which the epitope was derived (Rybicki 2014; Kushnir et al. 2012). At the same time, fusions with plant-derived proteins or only plant-typical sequences were found to improve the immunogenicity of antigens for vaccination against tumours (Massa et al. 2011, 2017).",

This method allows high concentration of recombinant protein (Oey et al. 2009). Nevertheless, it is technically difficult since several generations of plant regeneration are needed to select transformed plants with all chloroplasts bearing the gene of interest (homoplasmic state).

In addition, suspension culture allows homogeneity in cell proteins and sugars (N-glycans) due to the high uniformity of type and cell size (Lienard et al. 2007). Plant cells can be cultivated aseptically using classical fermentation technology, are easy to scale up and must comply with regulatory requirements similar to those established for consolidated systems based on both microbial and mammalian cells. In fact, plant suspension cultures, being made of single cells, allow comparisons with the mostly used mammalian cell production of recombinant pharmaceuticals, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Table 2). Cell-specific production rates of 8 pg/cell/day have been reported for the monoclonal antibody M12 produced in tobacco BY-2 cells (Havenith et al. 2014) compared to typical production rates of 20\u201340 pg/cell/day for CHO cells (typically carrying thousands of gene copies), showing that the difference between these systems is less than an order of magnitude (Santos et al. 2016).\n",

A protein expression system that is based on the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been developed (Mayfield et al. 2003). This alga has nuclear, plastidial and mitochondrial genomes completely sequenced. In this system, chloroplast-targeted transgenes were used to express different recombinant, health-related proteins. Like bacteria, the chloroplast lacks the machinery to perform complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (the glycosylated proteins come from the endoplasmic reticulum), but, unlike E. coli, Chlamydomonas chloroplast allows the disulphide bond formation and is able to carry out some types of phosphorylation. Unlike higher plants, C. reinhardtii has a single chloroplast, with about 80 genome copies. Consequently, conversion of all copies of the chloroplast genome to recombinant homoplasmy is facilitated. Complex molecules such as fully functional antibodies, therapeutics (among which a candidate therapeutic vaccine against human papillomavirus-related tumours based on a soluble, immunogenic form of the E7 viral protein) and other biologics have been produced with various yields highlighting the potential of microalgae as alternative platforms for the production of biologics for human uses (Mayfield et al. 2003; Demurtas et al. 2013). This relatively novel platform offers advantages including short time from transformation to scaling-up, rapid growth (doubling time of few hours), ease of cultivation, safety (microalgae do not harbour human pathogens and many are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) organisms) facilitating production of biopharmaceuticals in GMP conditions and homogeneity of protein production. Technologies for molecular pharming in C. reinhardtii are still in the infancy, while efforts are made to bring productivity to levels comparable to those of well-established platforms.",

Programmable nucleases, like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and RNA-guided endonucleases, have been used for genome editing in plant cells, amplifying the horizon of plant molecular farming (Li et al. 2013; Shan et al. 2013; Nekrasov et al. 2013). Recently, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated) system has been successfully used in a wide range of plant species (Bortesi and Fischer 2015) but not in plant suspension cells. The system is based on a short RNA guide (sgRNA) which associates to the Cas9 endonuclease to create a double-stranded break (DSB) in the target genomic DNA. As a consequence, mutations are generated through either error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) of the intended cleavage site. NHEJ has been used to generate mutagenic insertions/deletions often leading to gene inactivation. The resulting changes at chromosomal target sites can be indistinguishable from naturally occurring genetic variation. However, the system can be used to introduce larger modifications and insertion of exogenous sequences. Moreover, similar to \u201ctraditional\u201d gene insertion, if A. tumefaciens is used as a delivery vector of CRISPR-Cas9, the resulting genome-edited plants contain foreign DNA sequences, in addition to those that encode the programmable nucleases, in the host genome. On the other hand, the use of episomal plasmids to deliver these nucleases into plant cells has to take into account that transfected plasmids are rapidly degraded in cells by endogenous nucleases and that the resulting DNA fragments can be inserted at off-target sites in host cells (Kim et al. 2014).",

Moreover, when using protein-and-RNA-only systems, there is no need to optimize codon usage or to find promoters that will express Cas9 and gRNAs. In 2015, the delivery of RNPs into protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana attenuata and Oryza sativa and the induction of targeted genome modifications in regenerated plants were reported. Purified Cas9 protein was mixed in molar excess with gRNAs targeting genes from the three plant species in vitro to obtain preassembled RNPs.

Moreover, a certain degree of containment can be obtained because it implies the transfection of many cells with the virus genome followed by its cell-to-cell movement but no systemic spreading (Peyret and Lomonossoff 2015).",

As already explained, in emergency, the transient methods assure the shortest leading times to the final products. That\u2019s why the major examples of plant-made vaccines in clinical trial are from transient approaches (Table 4). As an example, influenza virus, a very complex pathogen with 16 different hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and characterized by occurrence of antigenic shift abolishing cross-protective immunity of the host even against strains of the same subtype, has the potential to be pandemic as happened in 2009 for the H1N1-type influenza virus. To control its diffusion by vaccination, fast production of a new HA antigen was needed. Medicago Inc. was able to develop a technology obtaining the accumulation of HA virus-like particles (virus-like particles, VLPs) in the apoplast of N. benthamiana cells by transient expression (D'Aoust et al. 2010; US patent application number 20130183341). Phase I (5, 10 or 20 \u03bcg of H5-VLP subcutaneously injected twice with alum adjuvant) and II (20, 30 or 45 \u03bcg of H5-VLP) clinical trial of the VLP composed of HA protein of H5N1 influenza virus (A/Indonesia/5/05) has showed, respectively, the induction of hemagglutinin inhibition titres at all tested doses and cross-protective CD4+ T-cell responses, indicating strong induction of long-term cell-mediated immunity by plant-made H5-VLP after 6 months of vaccination (Landry et al. 2012). No detectable IgE responses (and, therefore, allergy or hypersensitivity) against plant-specific mannose residues were found, one of the main issues that are often risen against the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals in plant-based systems (Ward et al. 2014). Medicago Inc. performed also a phase I clinical trial with 5, 13 or 28 \u03bcg of H1N1 influenza (A/California/7/09) VLPs that demonstrated safety and induced immune response to the virus, including cell-mediated immunity (Landry et al. 2010).",

In particular, a dimeric bivalent antibody format based on a scFv-Fc fused to IL-2 with highly homogeneous glycosylation devoid of the typical xylose/fucose N-glycosylation plant signature. In vitro studies showed that this antibody conjugate has a CD20 binding activity comparable to that of rituximab and an efficient elicitation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, hIL-2 in the context of 2B8-Fc-hIL-2 maintained the biological activity, as validated by 2B8-Fc-hIL-2 binding to the hIL-2 receptor and subsequent triggering of T-cell proliferation. The final touch was the discovery that glycan engineering, performed utilizing RNAi-silenced transgenic plants devoid of xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase activity (Strasser et al. 2008), was the best way to achieve an overall improvement of the biological functions (Marusic et al. 2018).",

Due to these properties, mAb 2G12 has been chosen by Pharma-Planta Consortium (http://www.pharma-planta.net) as the best candidate to be produced in plants under GMP conditions for the first in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation, phase I clinical trial (Ma et al. 2015). This mAb, representing a significant milestone in the commercial development of plant-derived biologics, has been produced by several expression systems and transgenic hosts (i.e. tobacco, maize and Arabidopsis) as well as in plant cell systems. However, the production of this mAb in transient expression systems was far superior to that obtained by stable transgenics in terms of yield and speed of expression. In particular, the highest yield of purified mAb (105 mg/kg fresh weight tissue) was obtained through the CPMV-HT system and retention in the ER (Sainsbury et al. 2010). In addition, binding and neutralization properties of plant-produced 2G12 with the \u201chumanized\u201d N-glycans were equivalent to that of the original mAb derived from CHO cells, being even more effective in virus neutralization.",

Passive immunization is an effective immunoprophylaxis against RSV, and treatment with a humanized IgG1 mAb, palivizumab (brand name Synagis, manufactured by MedImmune), is the current standard of care. In a recent report, plant-made different isotypes and N-glycoform variants were compared with commercially available palivizumab with respect to both in vitro receptor and C1q binding and in vivo efficacy. Whereas the antigen binding and neutralization activity of each variant were indistinguishable from those of palivizumab, their Fc\u03b3 receptor binding profiles demonstrated significant differences. Overall results indicate that interaction with Fc\u03b3R, hence antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and not virus neutralization, plays the major role in palivizumab\u2019s efficacy. Therefore isotype and glycan profile engineering utilizing glycoengineered plant hosts have been put into play, paving the way for enhancing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and the efficacy of these anti-RSV mAbs (with yields of ~200 mg per kilogram of plant biomass) (Hiatt et al. 2014).",

Although the incidence of the disease has continually decreased since the late nineteenth century, anthrax is considered one of major concerns in the era of bioterrorism in that inhalation of aerosolized spores has very high mortality rates. B. anthracis possesses a main virulence factor, the 83-kDa form of protective antigen (PA), composed of two exotoxins, also known as lethal toxin and oedema toxin, which cause cell death following introduction into the cytoplasm (Young and Collier 2007). PA elicits specific neutralizing antibodies and is the major target for the development of both anthrax vaccines and mAbs. A human mAb against the B. anthracis PA has been overexpressed in plants to be used in both prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of individuals exposed or infected with anthrax. A humanized glycosylated (e.g. \u201cdecorated\u201d with plant-specific glycans) and a glycan-deprived version of this mAb have been devised. Both formats were able to bind PA, neutralizing anthrax lethal toxin, and to protect mice against a lethal spore challenge. Surprisingly, the glycan-deprived mAb demonstrated improved half-life providing full protection in non-human primates against anthrax spore inhalation (Mett et al. 2011).",

In the perspective of being used as a wide-spectrum antifungal therapeutics, a chimeric complete IgG and IgG-like format (scFv-Fc) have been produced in agro-infiltrated N. benthamiana plants (Capodicasa et al. 2011). These engineered Abs were derived from a murine mAb (2G8) that inhibits fungi growth conferring significant protection against different opportunistic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans in animal models (Torosantucci et al. 2009). By binding to a fungal cell wall polysaccharide (\u03b2-glucan), both 2G8 chimeric IgG and scFv-Fc produced in plants retained the efficacy of the original mAb, being able to inhibit directly the growth of Candida albicans and to induce protection in animal models mimicking a systemic or vaginal C. albicans infection. In addition, both Abs promoted the killing of fungal cells by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in ex vivo assays. In a further development, a recombinant IgA version was also expressed and correctly assembled in dimeric form in plants (Capodicasa et al. 2017). These recombinant Abs may be exploited to tackle a broad range of human fungal infections, in alternative or in addition to classical chemotherapy (Table 6).",

Moreover, since expression of taliglucerase alfa is targeted to the storage vacuoles of the cell using a plant-specific sorting signal, this determines the presence of mannose sugars. In fact, GC utilized for ERT must display mannose moieties for entry into the macrophage. The expression process in the plant cell results in mannose decoration without glycan enzymatic remodelling, which is, instead, a downstream process necessary for drug of mammalian cell origin elevating the cost of goods for this specific product. Protalix brilliantly took advantage of the plant secretory pathway to obtain homogeneous paucimannosidic glycans in a cost-effective glycoengineering intervention within the cells. A fortunate circumstance to speed up ELELYSO approval was the US FDA warning about the potential for foreign-particle contamination in some Genzyme products including Cerezyme\u2122 (Drake et al. 2017). This event has been fundamental to raise awareness of the scarcity of approved safer alternatives to mammalian cell manufacturing. Moreover, it sets a positive example to be followed that could renew investors\u2019 interest in molecular farming companies, similar to what has occurred right after commercial approval for ELELYSO that determined a collaboration agreement Protalix BioTherapeutics-Pfizer. In addition, it should be positively noticed that 1-year treatment with taliglucerase allows patients and national sanitary systems for an estimated cost reduction by 25% with respect to administration of imiglucerase for the same period. Also the oral route of administration is currently being tested that might reduce discomfort or pain related to intravenous administration. The results demonstrate that the carrot cells protect the recombinant protein in the gastric environment and may enable absorption in vitro. Feeding rats and pigs with carrot cells containing GC proved that active recombinant enzyme can be found in the digestive tract and blood and can reach the target organs (Shaaltiel et al. 2015). These results demonstrate that the oral administration of proteins encapsulated in plant cells is feasible and may be a valuable alternative to intravenous administration of ERT.",

EMA states the importance of the establishment of master and working seed banks from the final transformant that have to be characterized in respect to the transgene (i.e. sequence, integrity, site of insertion, copy number, fate of the marker sequence), recombinant protein expression (i.e. tissue and organ specificity, regulation, expression level) and unintended changes in the levels of endogenous plant proteins and storage properties (storage conditions, shelf-life). Importantly, EMA regulatory guidelines indicate that all biopharmaceutical products in trials should be manufactured according to GMP (European Medicines Agency. Guideline on the Quality of Biological Active Substances Produced by Stable Transgene Expression in Higher Plants www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003154.pdf).",

Great merit should be attributed to this consortium that significantly contributes to the maturation of the EMA guidelines in this research area (as summarized previously in the text). As a consequence, a GMP manufacturing license (i.e. for the above-mentioned anti-HIV antibody P2G12) was granted to Fraunhofer IME for plant-derived monoclonal antibodies by the Germany regulatory authority and subsequent clinical trials application approved by the UK regulatory authority. These two achievements demonstrated that a GMP-compliant process for transgenic plants and the administration of a plant-made recombinant biopharmaceutical were feasible and acceptable to regulators throughout Europe (Ma et al. 2015).",

The vast majority of consumers agree that development in science and technology could make changes to their lives too quickly and that they may hide negative side effects on both health and environment (Castle and Dalgleish 2005). Social and environmental impacts are increasingly complex, and it is necessary to demonstrate that any research is ethically, socially and environmentally responsible. Biotechnology innovations, certainly successful on technical merits, must also be accompanied by social acceptance, assuming that market demand is favourable for a commercial success. In other words, it is a fact that benefits derived from PMP are now well highlighted; still regulatory agencies need to cooperate with developers to ensure that there is strict regulatory oversight of these products, in order to gain trust, confidence and support of the public, concerned stakeholders and investors and then progress on the marketplace.",

Plant-made biopharmaceuticals are on the intersection among the R&D areas of modern agriculture, medicinal plants/supplements and (plant) biotechnology (Fig. 4). The available studies show an acceptance of PMPs as a rare combination of medical and agricultural biotechnologies (Castle and Dalgleish 2005). As shown by some studies, there appears to be a positive public outlook about engineered pharmaceuticals, in general (Castle and Dalgleish 2005). The development of PMPs promises significant advantages for the production of vaccines and other therapeutic/prophylactic entities. However, the benefits and risks associated with new technologies must still be communicated and discussed with the public early, to maximize social acceptance. In fact, the above-mentioned study underlines that people are normally excluded from public debates and policy-making and normally do not have access to data and information about issues, if not through the media which most of the interviewees consider as giving misleading information. Studies have shown that even if people associate technology with relatively high risks and unknown consequences (especially genetic technologies), they still might not reject the technology (Castle and Dalgleish 2005). Oversight by regulatory agencies may give confidence to the general public and facilitate acceptance of new technologies, despite negative perceptions with regard to specific risks. More empirical research on public perceptions of agricultural biotechnology specific to producing novel vaccines and pharmaceuticals is needed before substantive generalizations can be made. Given that (1) oral pharmaceuticals are preferred, (2) people believe that most vaccines are genetically modified, and (3) public has expressed a high acceptance for PMPs, further development of this technology by commercial parties is desirable, if paralleled with appropriate market demand for specific products. Investment in clear communication by scientists and regulators will further enhance the public trust, optimism and ultimate acceptance for PMPs.\n",

In addition, the unaltered version of the engineered plant may be a food or feed crop, or neither. Expression may involve transgene(s) vehiculation into nuclear or organelle genome resulting in protein monomers, multimers or virus-like particles. The PMP may be intended for purification, or administration as a crude extract or whole-plant tissue with a route of administration may be parenteral oral, nasal or topical. All these aspects may emphasize the advantages of the plant-based system but also influence the steps toward the commercialization process. The aim of molecular farming is to produce large quantities of active and secure cost-effective pharmaceutical proteins. These approaches, in comparison with other established microbial and animal expression systems, show various advantages in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutical biomolecules. So far, lots of valuable pharmaceutical proteins and antibodies have been produced by this method, which can help the treatment of patients remarkably in developing countries where the production and preservation costs of such medicines cannot be afforded. However, there are still some disputes, such as the acceptance by the general public and the biosecurity hurdles. On the other end, it is astonishing to consider that a technology that began with the hypothesis that the plant cells could behave as a reactor for newly induced biosynthesis has actually resulted in life-saving treatments like in the case of Z-Mapp and Elelyso. The recent past has seen the emergence of PMP-based companies and the beginning of commercial era of PMP products. The success of Protalix Biotherapeutics and Medicago (just to name one of the expanding companies in the field) and many others will probably sustain the future of the PMP field. Looking ahead, the progress of further products to market and the gaining of a wider acceptance of the biopharmaceutical industry are hoped.",
