An altered 2 0 -O methyltransferase activity of \u03bb2 could thus potentially explain the altered interferon resistance of P4L-12 compared to the parental virus. Interestingly, in rotavirus, another member of the Reoviridae family, the capping enzyme VP3 was shown to act as an antagonist of innate immunity (Zhang et al., 2013) and it was proposed that variations in the efficiency of the capping reaction, more specifically that of methyltransferase activity, should be examined to determine if it could affect the ability of the virus to control the innate immune reaction (Arnold et al., 2013; Ogden et al., 2014) .
