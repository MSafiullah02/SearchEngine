            "text": "Internet users seeking health information on the Web begin their search using general search engines such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo [1-5]. Some may start searching on a social networking site such as Facebook [1]. Adults looking for health information from the Internet and social media, sometimes called online diagnosers, are more likely to be women, younger adults, and people who have higher education and better household earnings [1,3,6]. Users explore only the first few links from the general search engine results [7], and when assessing the reliability of the website, they primarily look for the source, professional design, and signs of scientific or official touch [7]. General search engines, however, cannot profile their users [8], although the characteristics and behavior of those seeking health information have been assessed [1]. Those seeking health information from the Internet consist of both the general public and health care professionals (HCPs) [4,9]. Health-related information-seeking behavior may be affected by several factors such as personal health disorders, thirst for knowledge, or even media coverage [1,10]. Information is transmitted to large audiences using both conventional media (eg, television, newspapers, and radio) and digital media (ie, Internet and mobile). The Internet has allowed information to spread fast and far. In 2013, a random-sampled survey (4750 people in the age group of 16 to 89 years) from population information system in Finland was carried out via telephone interview. It showed that 86% (4085/4750) of Internet users read media websites, 76% (3610/4750) searched information from Wikipedia or similar wikis, and 56% (2660/4750) participated in social networks such as Facebook or Twitter [11]. In 2013, 80% (3800/4750) of all households in Finland had broadband Internet [11]. Of health information topics sought after on the Web, specific diseases are the most common [1], including disease with a seasonal incidence.",

            "text": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial infectious disease caused by a spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) [12], which usually occurs in northern temperate climate zones worldwide [13], including Northern Europe (Nordic countries), Central and Eastern Europe, and North America (the United States and Canada). Incidences of Lyme disease differ depending on the month of the year (seasonal variation) and its specific ecological conditions, thus, making the risk of Lyme disease infection greatest between late spring and autumn [12]. In Finland, located in Northern Europe, the incidence of Lyme disease has increased, and seasonal and regional variation is apparent [13-16]. A bite from an infected tick and the resulting human infection typically occur when people spend time outdoors. Due to seasonal tick activity, the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease [12,13,17] mostly appear during summer [13,17]. In the early stage of the disease, local reddish ring-form skin rash, so called erythema migrans, occurs 3 to 30 days after exposure. Systematic symptoms such as fever, headache, muscular pain, and tiredness are common. Patients diagnosed early with localized Lyme disease can be treated with an oral antibiotic therapy [13,17]. If left untreated, the infection may disseminate throughout the body via bloodstream which results in, for example, joint inflammation and neurological and cardiac manifestations. The most common Internet queries on health information focus on specific diseases and medical treatments [1], including Lyme disease.",

            "text": "When searching current health issues, the searches used to access databases where this information is located may be utilized for disease surveillance. However, early warning systems may not monitor information only on a true epidemic but also on an epidemic of fear (fear epidemiology) [10,18]. The use of population health technologies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic demonstrated that an epidemic of fear may trigger changes in collective searching behavior gathered by early warning systems. Thus, false positive warnings may lead to media reports and then affect the public\u2019s search behavior on the Internet [18]. Notably, the general population\u2019s awareness of currently common infectious diseases may have an effect on health information searches on Google, which could be escalated by the media [8,10]. Along with current common infectious diseases, Lyme disease has also stirred interest among Internet users who have searched information related to Lyme disease via Google [5]. These search data from Google Trends have approximated the trends in seasonality and spatial distribution previously identified in Lyme disease [5]. As in the SARS epidemic [18], Lyme disease could also trigger an epidemic of fear, especially at the time of extensive media coverage on Lyme disease. This may lead to a positive feedback loop between Lyme disease searches and media coverage [18]. Two terms are defined when framing methods on health-related Internet information and epidemiological data [19]: infodemiology (information epidemiology) and infoveillance (information surveillance). Infodemiology is defined as a discipline within public health informatics that studies information in an electronic medium or in a population, with the aim of informing public health and public policy. When infodemiology data are used for surveillance purposes, the term used is infoveillance [19]. Lyme disease, serving as a well-defined disease entity, was used in our previous study [14] where we showed that HCPs\u2019 searches of Internet evidence-based medicine sources coincided with national register-based data on the geographical findings of Lyme disease diagnoses. Lyme disease searches of Internet medical databases presented seasonal and regional variation, and a suggestion was made to consider searches as an additional information source for disease surveillance. Although Internet users\u2019 health information\u2013seeking behavior has been studied previously [1-3,7,8], little data exist on the general public\u2019s health information searches of a dedicated medical database on the Internet. Therefore, Lyme disease was chosen as the indicator for our study to be evaluated from Internet medical portals.",

It also produces and maintains an Internet medical portal called Health Library (Terveyskirjasto in Finnish) aimed at the general public (population of Finland: 5.5 million people, 2016 [21]). This publicly available portal consists of more than 10,000 medical articles that were opened over 50 million times in the year 2016. Each opened article is tracked in a log file. The articles in Health Library follow the guidelines published on the Internet-based commercial portal service (Terveysportti), where the principal service is the Physician\u2019s Databases, produced and maintained by Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd. Quality criteria of Health on The Net [22] are met in the production process of the articles in Health Library. Physician\u2019s Databases includes point-of-care Evidence-Based Medicine Guidelines designed for clinical practice comprising 1300 primary care practice guidelines. In the guidelines, more than 4000 treatment, medication, or diagnostic recommendations are linked to quality-graded evidence summaries and further to Cochrane full-text reviews when available [23]. When producing the guidelines, Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd follows the process accredited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The databases also include, for example, 120 National Current Care Guidelines published by Duodecim Medical Society, access to the Cochrane library, Duodecim Medical Journal, Finnish Medical Journal, acute care database, drug databases, search engine for ICD-10, and procedure codes. Every year, approximately 15 million health-related articles are opened from Physician\u2019s Databases. Over 500 medical professionals within their own field of expertise participate in updating and developing the articles. Physician\u2019s Databases is available to HCPs throughout the Finnish health care system by employers; thus, the health care centers and hospitals purchase the right to use the service. The users of databases can be tracked in primary and specialized health care and also in pharmacies by an Internet protocol address included in a log file. Approximately two-thirds of Physician\u2019s Databases\u2019 users consist of physicians working in Finland (personal communication with P Mustonen, August 21, 2017), where there were over 20,000 working-age physicians in 2016 comprising 60% (12,507/20,970) females and 40% (8463/20,970) males [24]. Other users include nurses and pharmacists. The contents of both Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases are in Finnish.",

We hypothesized that the timing of the general public\u2019s and HCPs\u2019 article opening on Lyme disease is mainly similar, thus, making it possible to use the general public\u2019s article openings as an additional source of information for disease surveillance. However, we also assumed a priori that patterns would contain some differences in start and end points between openings in the Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases. The secondary aim of our study was to evaluate whether media publications on Lyme disease are associated with the general public\u2019s Health Library openings outside epidemic seasons. The hypothesis was that media coverage has an influence on the general public\u2019s article opening related to Lyme disease.",

We retrieved retrospectively logs of both articles in the Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases by assessing the number of openings of Lyme disease articles weekly by the general public and HCPs, respectively. The Health Library logs include only data on the article openings of Lyme disease across the entire country with no geographically distributional data, whereas the Physician\u2019s Databases logs include both openings and searches on Lyme disease for all 21 health care districts in Finland. Therefore, the article openings of Lyme disease for the whole country were chosen to allow comparable data from Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases. Users may access the Health Library database through different paths. Less than a fifth of users are not directed to Health Library via Google (personal communication with P Mustonen, May 4, 2017). This seems to be the case in Lyme disease, as most search Lyme disease from a general search engine such as Google by using words borrelioosi (borreliosis in Finnish) or borrelia. Health Library\u2019s article on Lyme disease is one of the first links to come up directing the information seeker to the Health Library database, whereas others use the Health Library\u2019s home page link from the Web browser\u2019s address bar to link directly to the Health Library database. Along with accessing Internet medical databases, users may also browse media websites, including information on Lyme disease.",

            "text": "The three largest and most influential nationwide media companies in Finland are Sanoma, Yleisradio (Yle), and Alma Media [11]. Sanoma consists of the largest national subscription daily newspaper (Helsingin Sanomat) and a tabloid (Ilta-Sanomat). Alma Media consists of a commercial television station (MTV) and a tabloid (Iltalehti). Yle is the national public broadcasting company in Finland. In addition to printed (the daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, and tabloids Ilta-Sanomat and Iltalehti) or broadcasted (television stations, MTV and Yle) information, these media also provide information to consumers via digital platforms, for example, on their websites. We chose these five media for further study because of the large number of weekly browsers on their websites in 2013 [11,25]. In December 2013, the number of website browsers ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 million per week. The data on Yle website browsers was 1.8 million per week in January 2015, whereas the data were not available for 2013. In 2013, a random-sampled survey via telephone interview (4750 people included) showed that Internet daily reached 84% (3990/4750) of Finnish people aged 15 to 69 years, 83% (3943/4750) of females and 85% (4038/4750) of males [11]. A total of 88% (4180/4750) and 77% (3658/4750) daily reached the Internet mass media in the younger age group of 15 to 44 years and older age group of 60 to 69 years, respectively [11]. The top five Finnish media websites with their characteristics are shown in Table 1. Each media website has a search functionality on their home page allowing consumers to search for the information they desire. We collected publications on Lyme disease by searching the words borrelioosi and punkki (borreliosis and tick in Finnish) using the websites\u2019 search functionality. Articles on Lyme disease were categorized by publication date for every week to be comparable to weekly openings in the Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases.",

In addition, the general public\u2019s opening patterns from Health Library appeared more seasonally fluctuating, and they increased over time in comparison with the rather stable HCP-opening patterns of Physician\u2019s Databases. In addition, we found occasional associations between Health Library article openings and media publications on Lyme disease during off-season months.",

In Finland, the incidence of Lyme disease has increased and also geographically expanded [16]. Therefore, we speculate that across the country, the general public is more aware and is seeking more information on the disease. In addition, the significant increase in the article openings of Lyme disease in the Health Library may be the result of an increase in net openings in the Health Library. In addition, it is possible that whereas HCPs have easier access to English-language websites, a language barrier with the general public could direct more traffic to Health Library, which consists of articles in Finnish. The increasing minimums in openings from Health Library (7.0-fold increase) compared with steady openings from Physician\u2019s Databases are clearly present, which indicates the general public\u2019s interest in Lyme disease also in the wintertime. It is also likely that HCPs are better informed on Lyme disease than the general public, thus, showing less fluctuation in opening patterns. The general public has shown a seasonally different interest on Lyme disease compared with HCPs. Publications on Lyme disease released in the media may be one of the factors affecting the public\u2019s different information-seeking behavior.",

Considering the total of published articles, no clear relation between published institutional texts or personal stories and the general public\u2019s information-searching was found (Multimedia Appendices 1 and 2). However, if merging all types of publications (personal stories, institutional, and other publications), three opening peaks were associated with publications. The following peaks in searches by the general public coincided with released media publications. In January 2013, there were two institutional texts and one personal story with institutional view. In December 2013, there was one institutional text and one personal story. In November 2014, there were two personal stories with a notice of TV documentary on Lyme disease. It is possible that not only a certain type of publication changes searching behavior among the general public but actually a variety of them do, especially when published in a short period of time, ranging from a day to 2 weeks. In fact, a peak occurred with the public\u2019s openings in November 2014, perhaps caused by two personal stories with notices of TV documentaries on Lyme disease, thus, suggesting that personal stories trigger the public to watch the Lyme disease documentary on TV and then start searching for further information from Health Library. We hypothesized that the multiple-peaked patterns caused by vigorously fluctuating openings in the Health Library during both maximum and minimum seasons could have been affected by media publications. However, the general public\u2019s article openings outside epidemic seasons are not consistently caused by publications, although three peaks could be associated with media coverage.",

Infodemiology studies health information on the Internet, such as log data on influenza, to improve public health [19]. Monitoring influenza, infoveillance has been used for assessing the epidemiology of influenza but with conflicting results. It included substantial flaws in geographic scales and timing, such as overestimating the intensity of the epidemic and missing the first wave of the influenza pandemic [8]. In addition, general search engines could not characterize their users, which consisted of both HCPs and the general public. We have previously demonstrated that Lyme disease searches by HCPs in evidence-based medicine databases on the Internet aimed at HCPs coincided with diagnoses, suggesting these searches could be used as an additional information source for disease surveillance [14]. However, it should be noted that not only do the diseases among the general public affect their information-seeking on the Internet but also health-related publications in the media and a fear of disease epidemic may have an influence on Internet searching behavior [8,10,19], also in the case of Lyme disease [12,26].",

In addition, possibly because of the small number of off-season publications, the association between every media publication and Health Library opening during Lyme disease off-season months could not be defined, even if some publications did occur at a peak in Health Library or Physician\u2019s Databases article openings. It is, however, worth noting that not only the general public but also HCPs may have been influenced by media publications. Although we collected publications from media websites with the largest number of page browsers, Lyme disease publications on less frequented websites may also exist. We cannot rule out that some visitors in Health Library could have been HCPs. Furthermore, visitors other than HCPs could have accessed the Physician\u2019s Databases as well.
