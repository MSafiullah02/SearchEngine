The situation seems dire, the stakes are high. Literature about the transition between the response and recovery phase in relation to pandemics is scarce. Further complication is that the pandemic will not allow countries to simply transition to the full-scale recovery, instead, a rebound from recovery to response phase is expected for a certain period until the immunization is in place. Pandemics indeed force us to think beyond typical emergency management structures; the cycles of the disaster risk management in the case of biological and other natural hazards are not exactly the same and no one-size-fits-all approach may be used. Still, some parallels may be drawn with the efforts to combat natural hazards and some lessons may be used from previous and the current pandemic.",

The recovery issues are mainly going to be dominated by politics, economics and social science.

These consequences, although uncertain, can be reduced with sound policy. However, the policy for pandemic crisis is unlike that applied to natural hazards. Pandemics force us to think outside of the box, or in this case, outside the typical emergency management cycle (Figure 1) . In other words, while four phases to reduce the impact of a natural hazard (preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation) are principally linear, the response and recovery phases for a pandemic are essentially non-linear. To illustrate, unlike earthquakes, cyclones or other natural hazards, which are usually one-off events occurring within a limited period, COVID-19 or any other pandemic, tend to come in several waves over a protracted period -until the effective vaccine or herd immunity is in place such as 1918 influenza pandemic and Ebola virus disease occurred in multiple waves (Saunders-Hastings & Krewski, 2016) . Also, natural hazards tend to impact relatively confined areas. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020 and already in April 2020, the virus has affected 185 out of 195 countries (Johns Hopkins University, 2020).",

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, agreed in 2015, focused the attention of signatory member states on preparing for a range of hazards including those of a geophysical, hydrological, climatological and meteorological nature. Importantly, it also included a strong public health focus and consideration of the risks from biological hazards (Maini, et al, 2017) . However, the Sendai framework did not distinguish the cascading impact of biological and other hazards in a systematic risk management approach. The emerging thinking is that the concept of pandemic must evolve from crisis response during discrete outbreaks to an integrated cycle of preparation, response and recovery (Bedford et al., 2019) . The recent Global Risk Assessment Framework (GRAF) promises to inform and focus action within and across sectors and geographies by decision makers at local, national, regional and global levels to improve the understanding and management of current and future risks, at all spatial and temporal scales (Gordon, 2020).",

The response of all governments, organisations and individuals at all levels, national or internationals, has been put to the test.

            "text": "As an illustration, Singapore's approach to the COVID-19 outbreak has been rated as effective as it managed to keep both the infection rates low and the economy strong (Lai & Tan, 2015) . One of the key success factors of Singapore's efforts has been assigned to the fact that Singapore has learned from their recent pandemics experience. In 2000, Singapore experienced an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease, which affected more than 3,000 young children, causing three deaths. Later in 2003, SARS hit Singapore, infecting 238 people, 33 of whom died of this disease. In 2009, avian influenza H1N1 struck Singapore, affecting 1,348 people with 18 deaths (Lai, A. Y., & Tan, S. L., 2015) . One of the most important lessons that the Singapore government learned from the SARS epidemic was the detrimental role of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the bureaucratic structure in handling fluid and unprecedented situations. Recognising that the effective response and recovery for COVID-19 depends on a large number of stakeholders (\"the health of all depends on each of us\", https://www.gov.sg/), the Singapore government has led a well-coordinated, multi-stakeholder response and recovery, which has been praised by other countries. However, Singapore paid far too little attention to their hundreds of thousands of migrants living in crowded dorms, excluded from government initiatives, among whom SARS-CoV2 is now spreading quickly (Ratcliffe, 2020) . Sadly, this was also reported in Germany where there was a rise in cases where refugees were not accommodated properly (Oltermann, 2020) . New Zealand's success factors were determined leadership and bold action early in the pandemic outbreak. Because of early and strong action, only a small number of New Zealanders got infected, were tested, contact was traced, and they were isolated. This prevented widespread transmission overwhelming the medical system along with the inherent effects such as widespread shortages of tests and personal protective equipment.",

For instance, the response to the devastation caused by the 2017 Hurricane Maria in Dominica and the surrounding Caribbean nations was characterised by most of the ineffective responses from Table 1 . The combination of poor technology and data collection systems, inadequate reporting, lack of public awareness and inclusiveness led to poor information being disseminated to people during the hurricane; this in turn inhibited people from preparing and therefore led to inaction and placed people at greater risk to the hurricane (Tonkin & Taylor International Limited, 2020). These very factors seem to also arise when reviewing the responses to COVID-19 in countries such as Iran and Italy .",

Indeed, much of the work in the response phase of a biological disaster revolves around the dissemination of information at national or regional levels (Figure 3) . One of the tried-and-tested approaches to responding to pandemic disasters is the epidemiological process of understanding disease transmission, including by contact tracing (O'Sullivan et al, 2019) . This type of response differs to that of a geophysical hazard in that it is concerned with individuals, rather than the wider picture (Lee & Riley, 2006) . While this strategy requires a considerable amount of resources, it has been effective in reducing the impacts of an outbreak (for example, in South Korea), implemented along with wide-scale testing and containment (McCurry, 2020).",
