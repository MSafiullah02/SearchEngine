            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) is thought to exhibit robust autoregulation to maintain adequate blood flow [1\u20133]. Recently, cerebral autoregulation was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in several studies [4\u20139], which treated cerebral oxygenation as a surrogate indicator of cerebral blood flow. NIRS estimates mixed tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels of the arterial, venous, and capillary blood within the field of view [10, 11], which allows the oxygen supply-and-demand balance to be evaluated under differing conditions. Similar to what has been done with the cerebrum, several studies have measured spinal cord oxygenation using NIRS directly [12\u201315] (via surgical procedure or thin fiber-optic probe placed in the intrathecal or epidural space) or indirectly [16\u201319] (via paraspinal muscle oxygenation monitoring, based on the paraspinal collateral network concept) to monitor spinal cord perfusion, but few studies to date have assessed spinal cord autoregulation using this method.",

            "text": "Clinical guidelines recommend elevating mean arterial pressure (MAP) to increase spinal cord perfusion in patients with acute spinal cord injury. Specifically, they recommend increasing MAP to 85\u201390 mmHg using vasopressors and/or intravenous fluids to protect the spinal cord and improve the neurological outcome [20]. Similarly, guidelines recommend a MAP > 60 mmHg for protecting the spinal cord during thoracoabdominal aortic surgery, because intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative paraplegia [21]. However, increasing blood pressure does not necessarily increase tissue oxygenation. In fact, we recently assessed cerebral and renal autoregulation using NIRS under three conditions (normal, hypovolemia following hemorrhage, and subsequent fluid resuscitation) and demonstrated that increasing blood pressure and/or fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage has less effect on cerebral oxygenation than renal oxygenation [22]. There have been few studies investigating the impact of blood pressure alterations and/or circulatory blood volume changes on spinal cord oxygenation.",

Animals were housed with free access to food and water before the experiments. Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and oxygen using a standard animal face mask, and tracheostomy was performed. Anesthesia was maintained with 2.5% isoflurane (approximately 1.2 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [23]) and an oxygen\u2013air mixture (FiO2 0.6) via mechanical ventilation. Exhalation gasses were analyzed using an IntelliVue G5-M1019A (Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). An end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 35\u201345 mmHg was established during the animal preparation period, and this ventilator setting was maintained throughout the study. Electrocardiographic lead II was monitored with three cutaneous electrodes. The right jugular vein was cannulated with a 14-gage double-lumen catheter and a 5F pulmonary artery catheter (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and the right femoral artery with a 16-gage catheter. Tracheostomy and the placement of all catheters were performed using local anesthetic (levobupivacaine or ropivacaine), under general anesthesia. Saline 100 ml h\u22121 was infused for maintenance. Body temperature (under the tongue) was maintained at 38.0\u201339.0 \u00b0C throughout the study with an electric heater and air conditioning.",

A wide portion of the parietal scalp region was removed to avoid contamination by extracranial blood [24\u201327], and one NIRS probe (NIRO-200; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) was placed on the center of the parietal skull (Fig. 1a). In the dissections performed in our pilot study [28], bone thickness in that region was 5\u20136 mm and in the sagittal sinus was 2\u20133 mm for a 35-kg pig; thus, the bones did not interfere with cerebral NIRS measurements. The other two NIRS probes were placed on the thoracic (fourth to sixth) and lumbar (first to third, Fig. 1b) laminae of the vertebral arch, which were surgically exposed and flattened after removing the spinous process, to exclude paraspinal blood flow [29]. Because we used the probe with a distance of 30 mm between the emitter and receiver (Fig. 1c), the site of the oxygenation measurement was at a depth of approximately 20 (\u2248 30 \u00d7 0.7) mm. Hence, each spinal cord NIRS probe was placed on the surgically flattened lamina of the vertebral arch, approximately 20 mm from the center of the spinal cord. The distance from the surgical field to the spinal cord and the thicknesses of both the thoracic and lumbar spinal cords (approximately 10 mm) were verified in our pilot studies. We also confirmed there were no structures between the probe and the spinal cord except bone and dura mater. We used two NIRO-200 systems during the experiments because each system is equipped with only two NIRS probes. The tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was continuously measured using spatially resolved spectroscopy, with a standard procedure for the NIRO-200 system. TOI values were recorded electronically at 10-s intervals.\n",

Spinal cord autoregulation was quantified in a similar fashion to the COx, by calculating the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord oximetry index (T-SOx or L-SOx, respectively). COx, T-SOx, and L-SOx were calculated by recording the values of the MAP and each TOI every 10 s for 10 min during each infusion dose, generating 60 paired samples from which the correlation coefficients between the MAP and each TOI were calculated. When autoregulation is intact, the value of each oximetry index approaches zero, whereas in a pressure-passive relationship, they approach + 1. In contrast, when there is a paradoxical response (TOI inversely related to MAP), their values are highly negative. In previous studies, the COx thresholds used to distinguish between intact and impaired autoregulation were arbitrary and were chosen by the authors as being between 0.25 and 0.5. In the present study, a threshold of 0.36 was chosen, based on a previous study from another group [4] and our swine study [22], such that we defined the following states: COx (T-SOx or L-SOx) > 0.36 (pressure-passive); 0.36 > COx (T-SOx or L-SOx) > \u2212 0.36 (intact autoregulation); and COx (T-SOx or L-SOx) < \u2212 0.36 (paradoxical response).",

These findings suggest that negative TOI responses were more frequent than positive responses during phenylephrine infusions. Our results also indicate that the cerebral TOI at a MAP of 49 mmHg (62.4%) under the baseline condition (during 2 \u03bcg kg\u22121 min\u22121 of SNP infusion) was higher than all other TOI values in the subsequent experiments, suggesting that hypotension might be tolerated by the cerebrum in the presence of a normal hemoglobin concentration. In contrast, the spinal cord TOIs changed in a more pressure-dependent manner. Pressure-passive responses were observed more frequently than in cerebrum, and spinal cord TOIs decreased twofold during SNP infusion. We note that the effect of phenylephrine on spinal cord TOIs differed depending on the condition and that these TOIs were increased most effectively during hypovolemia (Table 1). One might speculate that the spinal cord perfusion pressure increased because of the decrease in CVP (outflow pressure) during hypovolemia. However, similar TOIs were shown for the hypovolemia and fluid resuscitation conditions at a similar MAP (Fig. 3), indicating that the effect of phenylephrine during hypovolemia reflected baseline blood pressure. Our findings indicate that spinal cord oxygenation is pressure-dependent regardless of the systemic volume.",

However, the relationship between the MAP and each TOI shifted less than 5% downward and fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship with each TOI. These findings indicate that CNS is volume-tolerant and that hypovolemia induces circulatory blood redistribution to the CNS, with the reduction in TOIs being limited. In fact, as we demonstrated in our previous study, renal oxygenation drastically changes depending on volume conditions, with the relationship between the MAP and renal TOI decreasing fourfold compared with the cerebral TOI, because of hypovolemia (the renal TOI decreased from 62 to 42% at 60 mmHg MAP). Subsequent fluid resuscitation reduced this to a twofold decrease (the renal TOI recovered from 42 to 52% at 60 mmHg MAP), despite the cerebral TOI showing similar changes to the present study [22]. We speculate that fluid resuscitation contributes more to the other organs compared with the organs of the CNS and that it might be only minimally effective at increasing spinal cord oxygenation. Based on the relationship between the MAP and each TOI (Fig. 3), we also speculate that blood transfusion might be more effective than fluid resuscitation and/or elevating blood pressure, but additional studies are required to confirm this possibility.",

In the present study, paradoxical responses were observed in the cerebral TOI in all animals during any stepwise infusions and occurred frequently with an increasing dose of phenylephrine. Although some previous reports have demonstrated that a phenylephrine bolus decreases the cerebral NIRS signal because of a decrease in cardiac output [30, 31], our findings indicate that paradoxical responses did not occur secondary to a decrease in cardiac output (additional file 1). As a part of the normal physiological response that prevents excessive increases in cerebral blood flow [7, 22], the rapid changes in perfusion pressure induce arteriolar vasoconstriction as the pressure increases and arteriolar vasodilation as the pressure decreases. The resulting change in the arterial-to-venous blood volume ratio explains the paradoxical response [32]. In our previous study, animals with paradoxical responses in their cerebral TOIs (60% of animals) maintained more stable cerebral oxygenation levels than those that did not show a paradoxical response, suggesting that this response is preferable to autoregulation for controlling appropriate blood flow [22]. The spinal cord has a similar regulatory process, but it may not be as robust as that of the cerebrum. During SNP infusions, paradoxical reactions were observed twice in the thoracic spinal cord, once in the lumbar spinal cord, and never in the cerebrum, indicating that the effectiveness of increasing oxygenation during decreasing blood pressure might be low and should not be expected to help in this case.",

            "text": "Several limitations of the present study should be addressed. We did not administer phenylephrine and SNP in a crossover design, with each stage occurring sequentially. It is possible, therefore, that the drug infusion order and/or repetitive drug administration during autoregulation assessment could have influenced the subsequent measurements. We induced a wide range of MAPs using phenylephrine and SNP under isoflurane (cerebral vasodilator) anesthesia. However, the results may differ if other vasoactive drugs are used to alter the MAP, either under anesthesia induced by other drugs or without anesthesia. \u03b21 stimulants [33] and norepinephrine [34] in particular can increase cerebral and spinal cord oxygenation compared with phenylephrine. Furthermore, although we did not measure blood gasses during vasoactive drug infusions, it is possible that PaCO2 changed with hemodynamic changes and affected the autoregulation assessment. We speculate, however, that PaCO2 was not likely to have changed much because cardiac output did not significantly change, even after 5 \u03bcg kg\u22121 min\u22121 of vasoactive drug infusions, except during phenylephrine infusion after fluid resuscitation (additional file 1). In addition, in the current study, autoregulation was evaluated using only oximetry indices, which were derived straightforwardly from the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient between the MAP and each TOI. Additionally, the correlation coefficient threshold that was chosen to distinguish between intact and impaired autoregulation was set at 0.36 based on a previous study [4], but this was chosen arbitrarily. Finally, the present study used NIRS as a surrogate indicator of blood flow, similar to previous studies [4\u20139], but NIRS evaluates the oxygen supply-and-demand balance by measuring mixed tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation within the optical field of view. The alteration of blood flow likely changes the TOI, but a given blood flow change does not necessarily cause the same TOI change under conditions where the oxygen supply-and-demand and/or regional blood volume change. In the present study, the oxygen delivery obviously differed between the three conditions. Furthermore, the regional metabolism and/or regional blood volume might have differed during the experiment, due to several interventions (vasoactive drug infusion, hemorrhage, and fluid resuscitation). These findings indicate that the effects of the changes in blood flow on the TOI did not remain constant during the experiment, suggesting that TOI might not accurately reflect blood flow. This might be an unavoidable limitation when NIRS is used as a surrogate indicator of blood flow.",
