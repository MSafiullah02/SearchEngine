            "text": "The development of microbicides is currently one of the most emphasized prevention strategies in the effort to slow the spread of HIV (Balzarini and Van Damme, 2007, Klasse et al., 2008). Microbicides are antiretroviral agents that prevent HIV transmission when topically applied in the vagina or rectum. In contrast to for instance condom use, microbicides should empower women to protect themselves. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where three times more 15- to 24-year-old women are now HIV-1 infected than men of the same age, an effective microbicide will have an important impact on the HIV epidemic (Quinn and Overbaugh, 2005). In addition to its safety, acceptability and efficacy, the affordability of a microbicide will determine its success in resource-poor countries. For some state-of-the-art microbicide candidates performing very well in preclinical studies (e.g. protein- and peptide-based microbicide candidates), a high manufacturing cost may be the most important hurdle hindering their real-world success (Klasse et al., 2006). Therefore, available and inexpensive antiretroviral drugs, including the 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine, should not be ignored in the search for a useful microbicide.",

Concomitant with the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium strains and a subsequent decrease in the use as antimalarial drug (Wellems and Plowe, 2001), other applications of chloroquine and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine have been investigated. In vitro activity of (hydroxy)chloroquine against a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and viral infections has been shown (Rolain et al., 2007). In addition, chloroquine exerts immunomodulatory effects (Savarino et al., 2003), which may be beneficial to treat autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) or to mediate inflammatory responses in microbial infections (e.g. malaria; Ramos-Avila et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The major mechanism for the anti-HIV effect of chloroquine seems to be the inhibition of glycosylation of the gp120 viral envelope protein, resulting in newly produced virions with severely reduced infectivity (Savarino et al., 2004, Savarino et al., 2006). Presumably, the weak base chloroquine accumulates in acidic organelles, including endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, so that the activity of glycosylating enzymes may be impaired by the increased pH or by a specific interaction with chloroquine. The mechanism of action of chloroquine has some consequences. First, as glycosylation in host cells is crucial for the replication of many viruses, it is not surprising that chloroquine is not only active against various HIV strains, but also against other viruses (e.g. SARS coronavirus; Keyaerts et al., 2004) among which also other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex viruses; Rolain et al., 2007). Secondly, the fact that chloroquine clearly affects host cellular enzymes (Naarding et al., 2007) may suggest that the likelihood of emergence of viral resistance against chloroquine is rather low. Finally, considering that the anti-HIV mechanism of chloroquine differs from mechanisms of commonly used antiretroviral drugs, combination can result in additive effects. This has been illustrated for the combination of chloroquine with hydroxyurea, the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine and didanosine and protease inhibitors (Boelaert et al., 2001, Savarino et al., 2004).",

As reported in Table 1\n, the viscosity of the chloroquine gels (1.4 \u00b1 0.2 Pa s) fell within the lower viscosity range of the commercial products. Obviously, the viscosity can easily be raised by increasing the concentration of the gelling polymer HEC; however, it should be noted that too viscous gels are more difficult to apply and may hinder proper distribution in the vaginal cavity, which is crucial for microbicide effectiveness (Owen et al., 2007).",

HEC gels were loaded with different concentrations of the diphosphate salt of chloroquine (i.e., 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/g) and evaluated for their antiviral potency. MT-4 cells were infected with HIV-1NL4.3 in the presence of a serial dilution of the gels. The IC50-values are the gel concentrations (mg gel/ml cell culture medium) required to reduce viral HIV-1 replication by 50% as calculated from the p24 content in the supernatant of infected cells at the end of the experiment (day 5). The placebo gel (no chloroquine) did not reduce HIV-1 replication at the concentrations tested (up to 100 mg gel/ml). Data represent mean \u00b1 sd of 3 independent experiments.",
