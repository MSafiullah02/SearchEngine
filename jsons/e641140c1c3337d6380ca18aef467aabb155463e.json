            "text": "DMSO : An alternative perspective THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES of the solvent dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were first examined in the early 1960s. At that time reports suggested that it had considerable potential as a therapeutic agent in musculoskeletal disorders and in a range of other conditions. Additionally, it was recognised that its ability to penetrate the epidermis of skin or mucous membrane, coupled with its use as a water miscible solvent, greatly enhanced the absorption of many drugs for which DMSO acted as a carrier (Jacob, Bischel and Herschler 1964) . Although these early reports provoked great interest and some enthusiastic application of this compound, its popularity did not increase, as might have been expected, but rather waned so that now, in 1985, it is thought of primarily as a solvent rather than as a therapeutic agent in its own right.",

It is in this context that it receives its only reference in the fifth edition of Clinical Pharmacology (Laurence and Bennett 1980) . Its use in the treatment of renal amyloidosis is also documented. The British National Formulary (Anon 1984 ) mentions its use for the symptomatic relief of interstitial cystitis by direct instillation into the bladder. After 20 years of use, apart from these indications, it appears to have received little official recognition.",

Equine adenovirus type 1 is no exception, but up to 50 per cent of affected foals may also develop diarrhoea (McChesney, England and Rich 1973) . A second serotype, equine adenovirus type 2 (Studdert and Blackney 1982) has been isolated from the stools of diarrhoeic foals and may represent a true enteric pathogen. This virus was shown to be widespread in Australian horses as judged by serological surveys but its significance in the UK is unknown. There are no reports of other viruses associated with foal diarrhoea but it would not be surprising if some do exist and have yet to be discovered.",

Salmonellae, by contrast, are clearly recognised as aetiological agents of foal diarrhoea. However, the incidence of diarrhoea caused by salmonella infection in foals is low compared to other species, Salmonella typhimurium being the most frequently implicated. It has been suggested (Morse, Duncan, Page and Fessler 1976; Gibbons 1980 ) that salmonella induce diarrhoea only in 'stressed' individuals.",

Other bacteria, such as Corynebacterium equi, which are considered to be part of the normal gut flora have, on occasions, been implicated in foal diarrhoea. However, the importance of such organisms as aetiological agents of foal diarrhoea remains to be clarified. Apart from infections caused by a single pathogen, a significant proportion of cases of diarrhoea in other species are associated with mixed infections, eg, with two viruses or a virus and a bacterium. Often, such infections are more severe than those caused by each pathogen individually (Tzipori, Makin, Smith and Krautil 1982) . A mixed infection of foals with rotavirus and S typhimurium (Eugster, Whitford and Mehr 1978) has been described and it is likely that others will be found.",

As indicated, a wide variety of potential pathogens has been isolated from foals with diarrhoea but because the reports are based on isolated outbreaks our knowledge of the overall importance of each pathogen is limited. Moreover, the role that other factors, in particular 'stress', might play in determining whether or not an animal develops clinical diarrhoea when infected with a particular pathogen is unclear. It is impractical and not really necessary to introduce prophylactic measures against all the potential pathogens and a large scale systematic survey to determine the most important pathogens should, therefore, be carried out. If such a survey was combined with a carefully compiled questionnaire, the results might suggest measures, such as a change in management practices, that would reduce the incidence of clinical disease. However, if certain infectious agents appear to be the primary problem, once the chief culprits have been identified, it should be possible to begin development of a vaccine.
