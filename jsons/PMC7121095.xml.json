Screening measures in high risk patients include pretransplant ferritin level >1000 ng/mL, Aspergillus galactomannan, serum beta-d-glucan, or serum Aspergillus PCR testing. Imaging with high resolution chest CT is recommended with radiographic findings such as halo sign (nodule surrounded by ground-glass attenuation), hypodense sign (low density within nodules), and cavitation in late stages suggestive for aspergillosis. Treatment of choice is voriconazole, although there is increased risk of secondary infection with mucormycosis. Failure with voriconazole alone may require treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, combination therapy (echinocandins with voriconazole), or surgical intervention. Despite therapy, survival at 1 year is 20%. Other fungal species such as Zygomycetes (Mucor, Rhizopus), Fusarium, and Scedosporium require surgical resection of localized lesions.

Older patients, positive CMV serology, allogeneic grafts, and GVHD are risk factors. Although ganciclovir has been used for CMV prophylaxis, it causes myelosuppression. Recent studies have shown comparable viral clearance with valganciclovir [4]. The gold standard for diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is by lung tissue biopsy demonstrating viral inclusion bodies. However, CMV may be diagnosed presumptively by PCR testing of blood or bronchoalveolar fluid, clinical symptoms (fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia), and CT imaging demonstrating ground glass attenuation, parenchymal opacification, or innumerable small (<5 mm) nodules. Treatment requires ganciclovir and CMV immunoglobulin. Treatment failure is associated with high mortality (>90%) particularly for those patients who progress to respiratory failure.",

Clinical characteristics include fever, non-drug induced erythematous rash, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia occurring within 96 h of engraftment. PERDS is attributed to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, IL-8 and IL-6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin that precedes neutrophil engraftment. Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been identified as a risk factor. Major criteria for diagnosis include fever without infectious etiology, rash involving more than 25% total body surface area and pulmonary edema. Minor criteria include hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, weight gain of 2.5% of baseline body weight, and transient encephalopathy. Three major criteria or two major criteria and one minor criterion are typically required for diagnosis. Discontinuation of G-CSF is recommended as well as corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20131.5 mg/kg/day) for severe cases.

            "text": "Noninfectious pulmonary complications in the late posttransplant phase include bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) especially in those patients with chronic GVHD [4]. Bronchiolitis obliterans occurs mainly in allogeneic transplant recipients, with an average incidence of 8%. Risk factors for BO include progressive chronic GVHD, age >20 years, prior evidence of airflow obstruction, respiratory infections, unrelated donor, total body irradiation >12 Gy, low pretransplant serum surfactant D protein level, and NOD2/CARD15 genetic polymorphism. Several pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested including lung injury caused by conditioning regimens, injury secondary to infectious etiology, recurrent aspirations-microaspirations or due to esophagitis-associated GVHD, or donor T cells targeting epithelial cells of bronchioles, leading to inflammation and damage. The majority of patients report dry cough and wheezing. Up to 25% experience upper respiratory tract symptoms; conversely, 20% of patients are initially asymptomatic. Diagnosis is made based on clinical characteristics, chest CT findings (air trapping, hyperinflation, ground-glass opacities), pulmonary function tests (PFTs) demonstrating new onset airflow obstruction, and no evidence of infection (including negative BAL). Biopsy is generally discouraged as the disease is patchy and peripheral, and samples may not show pathology. Patients may experience slow progression with occasional exacerbations. Some patients may develop recurrent respiratory infections and colonization with Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus, while others may progress rapidly to respiratory failure within a few months. Treatment is aimed at slowing and stabilizing the disease with recommendations based on small trials and expert opinions. Generally, high dose corticosteroids are given; adjunctive therapies include augmentation of immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, and potentially macrolides. Promising new directions include use of inhaled corticosteroids, extracorporeal photodynamic therapy, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies. Lung transplantation has been successful in a minority of patients. Mortality is 18% at 10 years, whereas attributable mortality in those with GVHD is 40% at 10 years. Age over 60 years, progressive chronic GVHD, disease relapse, respiratory viral infections, and rapid deterioration of PFTs are associated with higher mortality [5, 6].",

It usually occurs within the first 100 days. Patients at risk for COP include those with leukemia, radiation exposure, and presence of GVHD. Clinical presentation includes fever, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Diagnosis is made by clinical characteristics, radiography showing patchy peripheral consolidations/ground glass opacities, PFTs with restrictive pattern with no airflow obstruction, decreased diffusing capacity, and negative infectious workup including negative BAL. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Patients generally respond well to systemic corticosteroids with up to 78% resolving or remaining stable. Case fatality rate approaches 20% [4, 5, 7].",
