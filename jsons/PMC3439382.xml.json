Five-hundred sixty-seven patients requiring hospitalization were confirmed with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A in NYC [1]. In NYC, there were 16 deaths, 46% of admitted patients were <18 years old and 20% were <5 years old [2]. Eighty percent of confirmed cases had a known underlying risk condition, most commonly asthma (40% of confirmed cases) [1].",

Rapid viral antigen testing for diagnosis, which under ideal situations can yield results within 30 min, is not practical nor cost-effective in pandemic conditions [3]. Point-of-care ultrasound has been demonstrated to identify, in real-time, various pathologies of the lung, such as pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4-10] An algorithm for differentiating between various respiratory pathologies has been described (Figure 3) [4], and evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound have recently been published [11]. The use of lung ultrasound during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in adults has also been recently described [12]. We describe a prospective case series of children in whom clinician-performed lung ultrasonography was used to differentiate between different respiratory pathologies and assessed interobserver agreement of these ultrasound findings during the initial onset and surge of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (April to June 2009).",

These ultrasound findings are similar to those described in interstitial syndrome which is defined as three or more B-lines in a given lung region [10,14,15]. A-lines (horizontal, reverberation artifacts of the pleural line; Figure 7 left) which indicate areas of the normal lung were also noted when present [10,14]. Patients were classified as positive or negative for bacterial pneumonia based on the presence or absence of lung consolidation with air bronchograms [6,7,16] seen on ultrasound (Figures 7 right, 8, and Additional file 3). A clinical course with follow-up after 2 weeks (via electronic medical record and telephone interview) was used to determine disposition and outcomes of enrolled patients. Clinicians performing and interpreting ultrasound were blinded to chest X-ray results, and when performed per hospital protocol for possible admission, viral antigen testing results. Bacterial pneumonia on chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views) was classified based on the attending pediatric radiologist reading for \u2018consolidation, \u2018infiltrate, or \u2018pneumonia. For analysis purposes only, viral pneumonia on chest X-ray was defined as \u2018peri-bronchial cuffing, \u2018peri-bronchial thickening, or \u2018increased interstitial markings identified by the pediatric radiologist. Pediatric radiologists were blinded to the lung ultrasound results.",
