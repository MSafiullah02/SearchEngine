The goal is to identify optimal methods for presenting target antigens to the immune system in a manner that will elicit immune responses appropriate for protection against, or treatment of, a specific disease. Several different approaches to this general goal have been developed, some are empirical and remain poorly understood, others are more rational, being based, for example, on mimicking natural infections in vivo or on targeting particular features of the immune system. This article will review three categories of delivery systems: (i) adjuvants and formulations; (ii) antigen vectors, including live attenuated micro-organisms and synthetic vectors; and (iii) novel devices for vaccine administration. The review will be restricted to late stage developments in the field of human vaccination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There are currently several factors that are creating pressure to improve delivery systems for vaccines. First, in the current regulatory environment, there is a growing requirement to develop vaccines that are very well defined in molecular terms. Thus, as opposed to using wholeinactivated pathogens presenting a complex range of antigens, most newly developed vaccines are rather based on selected target antigens. In some cases these may be single molecules, or even fragments thereof, derived from an infectious micro-organism, a tumour cell, an allergen or an auto-antigen. The target molecule may be administered as a purified protein or as a peptide(s), or may be expressed from plasmid DNA or a recombinant virus. Often, such molecular vaccines are poorly immunogenic, implying a need for an adjuvant, a specific formulation or a vector system of enhanced immunogenicity 1 Calcium phosphate DT Was found to be better than Al(OH) 3 HIV-1 (rgp120) Increased seroconversion rate in seronegative subjects after single immunization (superior to MPL + QS21 or alum). Strong cell-mediated immunity (T-cell proliferation; superior to MPL + QS21), but no CD8 + (associated for example with HIV1, herpes viruses, hepatitis C virus, Helicobacter pylori, Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), but also for the development of therapeutic vaccines against cancer, autoimmune diseases or allergies 2 . New vaccines are also being developed to elicit mucosal immune responses in humans, for example to protect against pathogens such as influenza virus, HIV1, HSV or human oncogenic or wart-associated papilloma viruses. Unlike most of the traditional vaccines, these efforts require the recruitment of cellular or mucosal immune effector mechanisms and necessitate the exploration of new routes of administration, new formulations, and new adjuvant systems 3 . Third, improving vaccine administration generally, either for the physician, or more importantly for the customer, towards pain-free and safe needle-less devices is likely to represent a major driver in the future vaccine market.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 880, "end": 881, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 938, "end": 939, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Why do we need innovative delivery technologies?"}, {"text": "Adjuvants encompass a highly heterogeneous group of substances capable of increasing or modulating humoral and/or cellular immune responses. They include mineral compounds (e.g. aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate), water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions (e.g. incomplete Freund's adjuvant [IFA] or MF59, respectively), chemically or genetically detoxified bacterial toxins, such as the cholera toxin (CT) or lymphotoxin (LT) from Escherichia coli, saponins (QuilA, QS21), muramyl di-or tripeptides and derivatives (MTP-PE), copolymers, ISCOMS, cytokines, CpG oligonucleotides, and combinations thereof (Table 1) 1,4-6 . Some of these adjuvants may facilitate long-term persistence of the antigen at the injection site (the so-called 'depot' effect). Others may target antigen presenting cells (APCs) by presenting antigens in a particulate state, or may specifically elicit the production of a pattern of cytokines relevant to the induction of a Th1 or Th2 response 1, 4 . Efficient enhancement of antibody responses has been possible in humans for many decades through the use of aluminium salts 4 . By contrast, enhancement of the magnitude and duration of cellular (Th1) immune responses has been more difficult to achieve, even if some lymphoproliferative and, to a much lower extent, cytotoxic T-cell responses have been observed with selected antigen-adjuvant combinations (Table 1) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . To elicit mucosal immunity, many approaches have exploited soluble holotoxins mixed with antigen, such as the holotoxin from Vibrio cholerae (CT), from E. coli (heat labile LT), or Bordetella pertussis (PT). In humans, CT is highly toxic, therefore attempts have Vaccination focused on the use of the CTB subunit, which can bind to the widely expressed GM1 ganglioside, but lacks the toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the A subunit.

Liposomes are artificial, spherical, closed vesicles which consist of one or more lipid bilayers. Liposome-encapsulated antigens are delivered more efficiently to the cytoplasm of APCs, presumably as a result of membrane fusion. Usually, liposomes are made from ester phospholipids. More recently, polar phospholipids from archebacteriae have also been used, leading to so-called 'archeosomes' 14 . The latter are based on regularly branched phytanyl chains, with 20 or 40 carbon length. Archeosomes demonstrate better stabilities to high temperature, alkaline pH, serum proteins, when compared with conventional liposomes. Other formulations being explored include spherulites (multilamellar vesicles made of biocompatible amphiphiles) and transfersomes (highly deformable vesicles which can deliver small molecules non-invasively through the skin) 13, 15 .

Partial remissions and disease stabilization were observed in at least a fraction (usually in the range of 10-30%) of the vaccinees. Despite such encouraging results, procedures to prepare and load DCs with antigens remain expensive and cumbersome, making it difficult to apply on a large scale to current clinical practice. One alternative being explored in humans consists in isolating exosomes (subcellular organelles containing both MHC class I and II and T-cell co-stimulatory molecules) from DCs as a basis for a cell-free vaccine 28 . In animal models, exosomes isolated from tumour peptide-pulsed DCs could prime efficiently in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocytes capable of eradicating or suppressing growth of established tumours.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 120, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 766, "end": 768, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dendritic cells and exosomes"}, {"text": "A number of new needle-free or modified needle devices, which carry potentially a number of advantages over conventional needle injection, are being developed for vaccine administration [29] [30] [31] . Such advantages include increased safety, acceptability and, therefore, treatment compliance, as well as potentially increased efficacy linked to a broader, or modified, tissue distribution of the antigen, ease of use leading to self-administration, administration of smaller doses of the antigen and adjuvants, as well as Vaccination delivery via either the mucosal (nasal or oral), subcutaneous or intradermal route 29, 30 . Table 3 summarizes devices which have been (or are being tested in humans). The Macroflux microneedle system allows administration of the antigen dry-coated onto microneedles. When pressed onto the skin, the microprojections create mechanical pathways through the superficial skin, allowing intracutaneous delivery of the antigen to an average depth of 100 \u00b5m. The antigen dose administered can be controlled by the formulation, wearing time, and system size. The largest experience in the field of needle-free delivery to humans has been gained with a variety of jet-injectors able to deliver vaccines by the subcutaneous route 32, 33 . These devices use forces derived from two sources of power, either a spring or compressed gas, to propel the vaccine through the skin. Needle-free injection was found to increase immune responses to both conventional and DNA-based vaccines: for example, seroconversion rates as well as antibody titres elicited in humans by a hepatitis A vaccine or a trivalent influenza vaccine were found to be increased by at least 10% when using needle-free injections, as opposed to needle and the administration of volumes of up to 1 ml. Although most systems have been Powderject system) designed to administer antigens as a liquid, one system (Powderject) relies on a pre-filled helium-powered system in which dry-powder formulations, stable at room temperature (e.g. plasmid DNA) are precipitated onto small (3 \u00b5m diameter) gold particles for administration through the skin Patches for transcutaneous Shigella or The antigen in combination with an adjuvant (e.g. CT or LT) are administered immunization Salmonella onto hydrated skin. In various animal models, and more recently in humans, antigens, CS6 this approach was found to elicit antibodies (both IgGs and IgAs), as well as a (E. coli), LT strong lymphoproliferative response, in the absence of any adverse event 35 Aerosol for delivery of Measles In order to produce fine particles without damaging activity of the virus, a live powder vaccines attenuated measles virus is micronized by jet milling to generate particles with the appropriate size for pulmonary delivery (1-5 \u00b5m). Particles are blended with an inert carrier to improve aerosol dispersion with a nebulizer 36 syringe administration 34 . Further work is required, however, to control the consistency of the pressure of injection to ensure proper delivery of vaccine to various types of skin. Also, the greater depth of administration, the greater discomfort. An advantage of spring-powered devices is that they are usually lighter and smaller than gas-powered devices. They are also more durable and inexpensive. Coiled springs, however, provide only a limited pressure. In contrast, gas-operated devices are more powerful. As such, they allow the administration of larger volumes through both the subcutaneous and intramuscular route. The gas cartridge needs, however, to be replaced regularly, making these usually large devices more costly than systems operated with a coiled spring. With both systems, the antigen can be administered either in a liquid form, or as a powder (e.g. adsorbed onto a microscopic gold particle, as in the Powderject system).
