Wet and dry cough are classified as per parent/carer reports, which were found previously to be accurate (compared with respiratory physician and bronchoscopy) in a study of children with chronic cough.34 The cost-of-illness data are collected at each parent/carer contact, specialist review and from examining medical records. A minimum of three contact attempts are made at each weekly time-point. We did not employ daily diary cards as planned originally, since although their use in chronic cough studies was reliable, we found that in children with acute cough diary completion and return rates were low during preliminary work undertaken for this study. We also could not use smartphone apps as the ownership of smart phones in the target communities is low. Thus, instead we relied on weekly parent recall of acute child illness, which has been shown to introduce minimal bias (<10%) in prevalence studies.35",

The decision to follow children until day 56 was based on data from our ED cough study, suggesting 42% of children with persistent cough at day 28 will be diagnosed with PBB (manuscript in preparation) that resolves with a 14-day course of amoxycillin\u2013clavulanic acid.

Group allocation is concealed in opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes kept in a locked cabinet at the Centre for Children's Health Research, South Brisbane. At randomisation, the child's cough history over the past 28 days and study-specific strata are confirmed by the Central Coordinating Site. The Study Coordinator selects the next consecutively numbered, opaque, sealed envelope from the relevant strata pack, opens the envelope and extracts the randomisation code. Two people check the allocation and the code is assigned to the participant. The Study Coordinator then arranges for the study physician to review within 2 weeks of randomisation those children allocated to the intervention arm. If siblings are also enrolled and each child is still coughing at day 28, randomisation occurs for the first child enrolled (ie, earliest study number) and all siblings are allocated subsequently to the same arm.

These pointers are explained in the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand position statement.37Tertiary hospital management: that usually requires investigations to be conducted at a paediatric tertiary centre (eg, flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, chest high-resolution CT scan, fluoroscopic swallow screening, etc).",

The time horizon will be specified and current practice (standard care) will be the comparator; and future costs and benefits will be discounted at 3% to present values. Central to this analysis will be the modelling of uncertainty surrounding data quality and gaps using sensitivity analyses, and extension of time horizon, using Treeage software (Treeage Software, Williamstown, Massachusetts, USA).

The use of guidelines by clinicians depends on several factors, which include level of evidence, feasibility, degree of implementation and inherent clinician factors.58 Using an algorithm facilitates clinical guideline implementation by clearly describing pathways of care based on whether the child presents with a specific or non-specific cough. While this study uses specific study physicians, the overall goal is widespread adoption of the guidelines and management algorithm in the primary healthcare setting. Our extensive data collection, including direct and indirect costs of illness and healthcare provision, are important in achieving this goal.

Studies evaluating ARI and chronic cough have had differing study designs, objectives and end points between populations. Australian data suggest cough burden is independent of age and aetiology, but dependent on clinical setting.29 In Australia, there are clear risk and burden distinctions between children from urban and remote areas and between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.59 Indigenous children in urban areas have received much less attention than those in remote centres. Failure to account for these differences may lead to inappropriate interventions or implementation of management guidelines that may not be applicable across all settings.",

Whether persistent shedding, new acquisition and/or virus\u2013bacteria interactions are associated with the development of chronic cough post-ARI is a clinical and research gap needing to be addressed. A study of 170 children aged 5\u201316 years presenting to their family physician with a cough lasting >14 days detected M. pneumoniae and B. pertussis in 12.9% and 36.6%, respectively.63 Cough duration was shorter in M. pneumoniae than B. pertussis cases and codetection with respiratory viruses was not associated with cough duration.63 An important limitation of this study63 was that data were not collected from the time of ARI onset. Other studies64 have also tested for bacteria and viruses in nasopharyngeal specimens, but to date none have followed children from ARI onset and examined the association with developing chronic cough. In the analyses of microbiological data collected in our study of children attending an ED with cough, M. cattarhalis detected by PCR in anterior nasal swabs collected at time presentation was the only organism independently associated with persistent cough at 4 weeks after controlling for age, gender and the presence of any viruses.5 Our Brisbane-based lower airway studies of children with chronic cough from PBB found intense neutrophilic airway inflammation and evidence of innate immune activation, suggesting that PBB may follow a single ARI episode with impaired pathogen clearance from the airways, either permanently or temporarily leading to a cycle of chronic inflammation.65 Small case series from the late 1990s have reported chronic pulmonary sequelae following influenza infection in young children66 and a relationship between adenovirus infection and bronchiectasis.67",

In another of our studies,52 just 27% of children sought further medical advice for cough in the 4 weeks following presentation to an ED for an illness with cough as a symptom (unpublished data). Furthermore, of the 9.7% receiving antibiotics during this 4-week period,5 most were prescribed antibiotics at the time of the original ED presentation. Hence, it is unlikely this will influence the validity of our RCT for several reasons: (1) We can assess any intervention either group receives outside of the RCT since our weekly follow-up data collection captures these events. (2) In the possible, but unlikely event of a change in treatment in the control group, the effect size of the intervention will be smaller requiring a larger sample size. The a priori sample size is conservative with 90% power and a smaller effect size will still be detectable within the available study population (eg, a 35% difference with power of 80% requires 114 per group). (3) To ensure robustness, an independent person will recalculate the sample size when 50% of children have completed the RCT component.",
