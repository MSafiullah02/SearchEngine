During transport the precursor HA undergoes post-translational proteolytic cleavage into the fragments HA1 and HA2. Cleavage which is a pre-condition for the fusion capacity of the hemagglutinin (Huang et al., 1980 (Huang et al., , 1981 Lenard and Miller, 1981; Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; White et al., 1981) and, thus, for virus infectivity (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) involves the sequential action of a trypsin-like endoprotease and carboxypeptidase N which are both of host origin (Lazarowitz et al., 1973; Garten et al., 1981; Garten and Klenk, 1983) . There is increasing evidence that structural differences at the cleavage site are important for the spread of infection and for pathogenicity (Bosch et al., 1979 . In most hemagglutinins, HA1 and HA2 are linked by a single arginine. Many cells lack a suitable endoprotease to activate these hemagglutinins. Thus, virions with uncleaved HA are obtained that can be activated in vitro. However, with other virus strains, notably with fowl plague virus (FPV), there is an intervening sequence of several basic amino acids (Porter et al., 1979) . This type of hemagglutinin is activated by a protease present in all cells. Thus, virions with uncleaved HA are not available for in vitro studies (Klenk et al., 1975). lonophores have proved to be useful tools for studying glycoprotein processing. The monovalent carboxylic ionophore monensin has probably found the widest application.

Figure 2 shows a pulse-chase exper- for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with thermolysin (The), trypsin (Try), and plasmin (Pla). Each enzyme was present at a concentration of 10 pg/ml. The samples shown in lanes 1 and 5 were not treated with proteases. The virus preparations were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a slab gel. iment in which infected cells were labeled with tritiated mannose. A23187 interferes with proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin as indicated by the dose-dependent decrease of the cleavage fragments HA1 and HA2. Synthesis of the uncleaved precursor HA is not affected, and predominantly 2912 in this form the hemagglutinin is also incorporated into virus particles (Figures 3, 4 and 5). HA synthesized in the presence of A23187 can also be labeled with [I-3H]galactose (data not shown), indicating that processing of the carbohydrate side chains to hybrid or complex type oligosaccharides is possible under these conditions. Proteolytic activation of the FPV hemagglutinin by defined proteases Virus particles containing uncleaved HA after growth in the presence of A23187 were incubated with trypsin. Figure 3 demonstrates that the FPV hemagglutinin is readily cleaved by this enzyme as had to be expected from the structure of the cleavage site (Porter et al., 1979; Garten et al., 1982) . Other proteases have also been tested. These include plasmin which cleaves the hemagglutinin of strain A/WSN/34 (HINI) (Lazarowitz et al., 1973) , thermolysin which cleaves the hemagglutinin of strain A/chick/Germany/N/49 (H1ON7) ) and chymotrypsin (data not shown) which cleaves the hemagglutinin of both of these strains. The FPV hemagglutinin is susceptible to none of these enzymes. Correct cleavage of the hemagglutinin by trypsin should be accompanied by an activation of the fusion capacity. We have therefore analyzed FPV grown in the presence of A23187 for its capacity to induce hemolysis at low pH. Table  I demonstrates that such virus requires trypsin cleavage to express hemolytic activity comparable with that of control virus grown in the absence of A23187. Thus, proteolytic cleavage is clearly a pre-condition for the fusion activity of the FPV hemagglutinin, too. Since the FPV hemagglutinin is cleaved in a large variety of different tissues, trypsin, a protease of the digestive tract, can be ruled out as the enzyme responsible for cleavage in vivo.",

            "text": "Search for the natural enzyme should therefore focus on the so-called tissue proteinases. Among these, cathepsin B is very active in splitting the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of a pair of basic amino acid residues and has therefore been suspected of being the natural activator of prohormones and zymogens that require cleavage of such peptide bonds for activation (Ansorge et al., 1977) . Because of its similar cleavage site we have exposed uncleaved FPV hemagglutinin to a preparation of purified cathepsin Bi (Barrett, 1973) . At pH 7.2 this enzyme does not cleave HA (data not shown). Since cathepsin B is a lysosomal enzyme, incubation was also carried out at pH 5.4. Under these conditions HA is readily cleaved, but the cleavage products are not identical with authentic HA1 and HA2 (Figure 4 ). The largest cleavage fragment migrates slightly faster than HA1, a second fragment migrates behind HA2, and a third fragment co-migrates with HA2. Thus, it is not likely that cathepsin B acts as the natural activator of the influenza hemagglutinin. It is worth noting that the results shown in Figure 4B resemble an observation Flg. 6.

The FPV hemagglutinin is cleaved by trypsin, but it was interesting to see that this could not be accomplished by any of the other proteases analyzed, although each one of these has been found to cleave other hemagglutinins. This observation is compatible with the view that the accessibility of the cleavage site to proteases varies with different hemagglutinins. As has been pointed out above, when looking for the neutral cleavage enzyme, one should concentrate on tissue proteases. We have followed two routes in this search. Firstly, we thought that a lysosomal enzyme might be a suitable candidate. Although it is unlikely that the hemagglutinin passes through lysosomes on its way to the cell surface, it is conceivable that the hemagglutinin and lysosomal enzymes encounter each other en route from their common site of synthesis in the rough ER to their different destination sites. However, when a purified preparation of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B was employed, the hemagglutinin cleavage products differed from authentic HA1 and HA2. In the second approach, lysates of uninfected cells were assayed for their capacity to cleave HA in vitro. Using this system, correct cleavage fragments were obtained when the reaction was carried out at neutral pH. Another requirement was a relatively high calcium concentration. This finding is compatible with the view that when administered in the calcium-free medium as has been done in this study, A23 187 inactivates the cleavage enzyme by calcium depletion of the host cell. It is interesting to note that a protease from amnion fluid that cleaves the F protein of Sendai virus also requires calcium ions (Appleyard and Davis, 1983) . Our observations taken together indicate that the cellular enzyme that activates the FPV hemagglutinin is calcium dependent and has an optimal activity at neutral pH. It is neither cathepsin B nor another lysosomal enzyme. Its exact nature and intracellular location remain to be elucidated. However, it is reasonable to assume that it is a component of the Golgi apparatus or of membrane vesicles mediating transport between Golgi and plasma membrane, since proteolytic cleavage occurs late in transport, but before arrival of the hemagglutinin at the cell surface Matlin and Simons, 1983) .",

Although proteolytic activation of the fusion capacity has not been definitely shown before with FPV, this observation does not come as a surprise with the large body of information on other influenza hemagglutinins available. It should be pointed out, however, that there are numerous other viral glycoproteins, notably those of retroviruses, that undergo proteolytic processing at FPV hemagglutinin-like cleavage sites containing at least two basic amino acids (Oroszlan et al., 1980; Hunter et al., 1983; Koch et al., 1983; Wunsch etal., 1983; Adachi et al., 1984) . These glycoproteins also appear to be responsible for initiation of infection, and it is conceivable that this function, particularly fusion capacity, requires proteolytic activation, too. However, definite proof for these assumptions has not been obtained yet, because for their metabolic instability the uncleaved precursor glycoproteins are not available for proteolytic activation in vitro. Inhibition of in vivo cleavage with A23187 may provide a suitable system to overcome this problem.",
