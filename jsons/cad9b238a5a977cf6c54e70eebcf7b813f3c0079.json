Ultrasonic scalpels or electrical equipment commonly used in laparoscopic surgery can easily produce large amounts of surgical smoke, and in particular, the low-temperature aerosol from ultrasonic scalpels cannot effectively deactivate the cellular components of virus in patients. In previous studies, activated corynebacterium, papillomavirus and H.I.V. have been detected in surgical smoke (2) (3) (4) and several doctors contracted a rare papillomavirus (5) suspected to be connected to surgical smoke exposure. The risk of 2019-ncov infection aerosol should not be any exception. One study found that after using electrical or ultrasonic equipment for 10 minutes, the particle concentration of the smoke in laparoscopic surgery was significantly higher than that in traditional open surgery (6) . The reason may be that due to the low gas mobility in the pneumoperitoneum, the aerosol formed during the operation tends to concentrate in the abdominal cavity. Sudden release of trocar valves, non-air-tight exchange of instruments or even small abdominal extraction incisions can potentially expose the health care team to the pneumoperitoneum aerosol; the risk is definitely higher in laparoscopic than in traditional open surgery. This outbreak thus poses a great challenge to the clinical work of surgeons who practice MIS.",

            "text": "Prevention and management of aerosol dispersal: During operations, whether laparoscopic or via laparotomy, instruments should be kept clean of blood and other body fluids. Special attention should be paid to the establishment of pneumoperitoneum, hemostasis and cleaning at trocar sites or incisions to prevent any gush of body fluid caused by air leakage or uncontained laparotomy incisions. Liberal use of suction devices to remove smoke and aerosol during operations, and especially, before converting from laparoscopy to open surgery or any extra-peritoneal maneuver. Avoid using two-way pneumoperitoneum insufflators to prevent pathogens colonization of circulating aerosol in pneumoperitoneum circuit or the insufflator. 3) Management of artificial pneumoperitoneum: keep intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure and CO2 ventilation at the lowest possible levels without compromising the surgical field exposure. Reduce the Trendelenburg position time as much as possible.This minimizes the effect of pneumoperitoneum on lung function and circulation, in an effort to reduce pathogen susceptibility.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

            "text": "Operation techniques: The power settings of electrocautery should be as low as possible. Avoid long dissecting times on the same spot by electrocautery or ultrasonic scalpels to reduce the surgical smoke. Special attention is warranted to avoid sharp injury or damage of protective equipment, in particular gloves and body protection. 5) Postoperative operating room and equipment management: all protocols involving postoperative cleaning and disinfection should comply with governmental and learned society instructions (1,8,9). Devices used on infection-suspected or proven patients should undergo separate disinfection followed by proper labeling. It is mandatory to specifically label and dispose clinical wastes separately. 6) Ideally hospitals should be immediately divided into two main categories: dedicated hubs for positive COVID-19 patients (with limited surgical staff and ORs, for those infected patients requiring surgery) and other both for emergency surgery and urgent oncological procedures in negative COVID 19 patients. Health authorities should allow surgical teams to move from one hospital to another. 7) Teaching and future recommendations: Strengthen the awareness on the hazards caused by surgical smoke and the management of intraoperative aerosol. Strict protocols must be established for the creation and maintenance of laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum to reduce the occupation hazard caused by aerosol exposure. 8) Operating staff protection: efforts must be made to raise awareness of the occupation protection on operating staffs, including surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses and all possible transiting persons in the OR. Correct two-way protective apparel (goggles, visor, mask, and body protective garb) should be routine. When Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

            "text": "health screening: In order to effectively battle against the possibility of prolonged 2019-nCOV outbreak, it is imperative to establish new standards of practice for admitting patients in the future. This should range from preoperative health screening to final differential diagnosis, including epidemiology investigation and adequate imaging. This outbreak not only raises challenges to MIS in terms of disease control today but also should remind surgeons that we need stronger occupational protection in the future. We must raise the level of awareness and protection measures for the risk of occupational exposure in laparoscopic but also traditional open surgery. There is an urgent need of a strict protocol to accurately manage the artificial pneumoperitoneum and the hazards of aerosol diffusion for surgeons. 1) Interim Guidance for Healthcare Facilities: Preparing for Community Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcarefacilities/guidance-hcf.html March 15 2020 2) Capizzi P J, Clay R P, Battey M J.
