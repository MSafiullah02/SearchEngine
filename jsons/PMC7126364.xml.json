The eradication of infected liver cells by both humoral and cytotoxic T-cell responses would be required for effective therapeutic vaccination.3 However, alum-based vaccines can only be used to promote humoral and Th2-biased immune responses.4 Therefore, the development of novel classes of adjuvant for an HBV therapeutic vaccine is an urgent clinical need.",

BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously on day 0 and boosted on day 7 with S28\u201339 (100 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcL of PBS) and the various MDP mimics (100 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcL of PBS). MDP-C (100 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcL of PBS) was used as a positive control. Mice were sacrificed 7 days after the last immunization. Splenocytes were collected and incubated with or without the HBsAg MHC I restricted peptide S28\u201339 (20 \u03bcg/mL) in ELISPOT plates. The difference in the number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells obtained in the presence or absence of HBsAg peptide S28\u201339 stimulation was considered as an indicator of the HBsAg-specific cellular response. As illustrated in Table 1 and 70% of MDP mimics synergized the HBsAg peptide S28\u201339 to produce IFN-\u03b3 at significantly higher levels ex vivo compared with S28\u201339 alone. Among all the compounds tested, five (1, 2, 6, 14 and 16) exhibited significantly better activity compared with MDP-C. Among them, compounds 6, 14, and 16 had the strongest adjuvanticity, as assessed using this test.",

Specially, the comparison of compounds 4, 6 and 19 showed that increasing the lipophilicity of R1 decreased the adjuvanticity, meanwhile, compound 4 basically lost its activity possibly due to the influence of isopropyl group in terms of increased lipophilicity or steric factors. The adjuvanticity of MDP mimics (e.g., 6 and 14) was the strongest when R2 was a chloro atom. Regarding the R3 group, it seems that replacement with an electron-donating group, such as a methoxyl group, was unable to contribute significantly to the activity of the compound (e.g., 7, 8, 13, 18 and 20). The electron-withdrawing group was not included in this Letter. Obviously, R4 is a critical factor that contributes to the immunological adjuvant activity of the whole molecule. MDP mimics exhibited the strongest adjuvanticity when R4 was a phenylethyl group (e.g., 6, 14 and 16). It is worthy of note that derivation of aromatic amino group (R4) of compound 15 using phenylethyl group to generate compound 16 resulted in extremely remarkable improvement of activity. Further introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitro group or fluorine atom, onto phenylethyl group at R4 doesn\u2019t lead to an apparent improvement in activity compared with the control group (e.g., 9, 11 and 17). Similarly, it also doesn\u2019t demonstrate dramatic effects on the activity for derivation of the aromatic amino group with certain unsaturated or saturated carbon chains (R4, e.g., 18 and 20).",

Most interestingly, the muramic acid moiety was fully replaced by an aromatic moiety for the first time, which completely changed the chemophysical properties of the molecule, from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity.
