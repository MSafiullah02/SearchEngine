Both intraviral and virus-host interactions, in the form of a myriad of perturbations, can provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in the viral infectious cycle. Also, understanding these PPI networks may aid the design of new antivirals. These strategies depend on both detailed structural and mechanistic information and on the availability of therapeutically relevant targets. In this sense, the initial focused approach to identify viroporin binders is being complemented with genome-wide interactome studies adapted to viral infections using high-throughput technologies, providing a dramatic boost in the search for possible PPIs [see de for a recent review].",

Other Y2H screens have included IAV M2 virus-virus and virus-host interactions (Shapira et al. 2009 ), or intraviral PPIs in the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (von Brunn et al. 2007 ). However, this method does not measure interactions between proteins in the context of the infected cell, is biased against membrane proteins, and cannot study protein complexes that are weakly or transiently associated. The bias against membrane proteins can be compensated using the split-ubiquitin-based yeast two-hybrid screen, e.g., in a screen to search for binders of the small hydrophobic (SH) protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Li et al. 2015) .",

The seasonal flu caused by the influenza A virus (IAV) is known for causing pandemics with high mortality rates (Hay et al. 2001; Neumann et al. 2009 ), although its close relative influenza B accounts for half of the influenza disease in recent years (www.cdc.gov). Generally, influenza virions are spherical in shape ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter, although filamentous forms may also occur (Lamb and Choppin 1983) . The viral envelope contains three transmembrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 2 (M2), on the outside and a layer of matrix protein (M1) just underneath the membrane that contains cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. M1 forms an internal coat that encloses the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), i.e., the negative-strand viral RNA (vRNA) and nucleoprotein (NP), with small amounts of the nuclear export protein (NEP) and three polymerase (3P) proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex (Fields et al. 2013 ).",

            "text": "The viroporin M2 in IAV is a homotetrameric channel (Sakaguchi et al. 1997) . Each M2 monomer is a 97-amino acid protein comprising an N-terminal ectodomain (24 aa), an \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain (TMD, 19 aa), and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain (54 aa) that is a hotspot for interactions with both viral and host proteins during the IAV life cycle. The latter may therefore constitute an attractive drug target for the development of IAV antivirals. M2 has a pH-activated proton channel activity which is required to complete the uncoating process during virus entry. Upon virus internalization via endocytosis, M2 selectively conducts protons from acidified endosomes into the viral interior. This acidification of virion triggers the dissociation of the M1 protein from the vRNP complex, thereby enabling the transport of vRNPs into the nucleus for replication of viral genetic material (Helenius 1992) . For some IAV subtypes, the M2 proton channel raises the pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to protect the viral HA from premature low-pH conformational change during its transport to the cell surface (Takeuchi and Lamb 1994) . The channel activity of IAV M2 has been found to be sufficient for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in influenza-infected cells (Ichinohe et al. 2010) . Presently, there are more than ten structures of both wild-type and drugresistant mutant M2 channels in the Protein Data Bank [see review in Gu et al. (2013) ].",

Interaction between M1 with the M2 cytoplasmic tail was first suggested from the analysis of escape mutants (Zebedee and Lamb 1989) . Further work revealed a physical interaction between M1 and the M2 cytoplasmic tail at the site of virus budding, to facilitate virus assembly by promoting the recruitment and packaging of viral proteins and viral genome (McCown and Pekosz 2006; Chen et al. 2008) . The cytoplasmic tail of M2 contains an amphipathic \u03b1-helix (residues 45-62) (Schnell and Chou 2008) that can modulate membrane curvature in a cholesterol-dependent manner. This feature of M2 has been proposed to be implicated in (i) modification of local membrane curvature during virus budding to provide a stabilized scaffold for M1 polymerization and virus filament formation and (ii) alteration of membrane curvature at the neck of budding virions to facilitate membrane scission and virion release (Rossman and Lamb 2011) .",

For example, IAV M2 has been reported to arrest autophagy (Gannag\u00e9 et al. 2009; Beale et al. 2014 ), a cellular degradation pathway mediated by autophagosomes which delivers cytoplasmic materials to the lysosome that is regulated by autophagy-related genes (Atg). This process involves (i) target engulfment by an isolation crescent membrane (phagophore) to form the autophagosome and (ii) autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation of the intraautophagosomal contents (Fig. 15.1a) . IAV subverts this machinery by blocking this fusion, resulting in increased apoptosis of IAV-infected cells. In IAV-infected A549 human lung epithelial cells, M2 coimmunoprecipitates with Atg6/Beclin-1 through interaction with M2 residues 1-60 (Gannag\u00e9 et al. 2009 ). Atg6/Beclin1 is part of a complex that regulates autophagosome generation and degradation and is a common target of other viruses for the subversion of autophagy, e.g., herpesviruses and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [reviewed in M\u00fcnz (2011) ].",

In IAV-infected cells, the localization of LC3 changes from the cytoplasm and autophagosomal membranes to the plasma membrane (Beale et al. 2014 ), a change mediated by a putative LIR motif (residues 91-94, FVSI) present in the cytoplasmic tail of M2 ( Fig. 15.1b) .

Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of cyclin D3 expression, the study proposed that cyclin D3 is a negative modulator of IAV infection, competing with M1 for binding to M2 in transfected cells and therefore disrupting the important M1-M2 interaction in the context of an IAV infection. On the other hand, IAV may antagonize cyclin D3 activity by (i) relocating cyclin D3 from the nucleus (Fig. 15.2a) to the cytosol ( Fig. 15 .2b) to facilitate virus replication by promoting cell cycle arrest and (ii) targeting cyclin D3 for cytosolic proteasomal degradation to prevent its interference with M1-M2 binding ( Fig. 15.2b) . Cyclin D3 has been also reported to be a target of SARS-CoV viroporin 3a (Yuan et al. 2007) A recent study has identified M2 as a putative viral antagonist of BST-2 (bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2, also known as tetherin, CD317) (Hu et al. 2017 ), a protein that may restrict the release of infectious IAV (Mangeat et al. 2012) . BST-2 can inhibit the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses by tethering budding virions to the cell surface [reviewed in le Tortorec et al. (2011) ], e.g., in HIV-1, in that case antagonized by its viroporin Vpu (Neil et al. 2008) . However, the role of BST-2 in limiting IAV release has been disputed (Watanabe et al. 2011) , perhaps due to IAV strain-specific susceptibility to BST-2 restriction. This interaction was confirmed by orthogonal assays, and using chimeric and truncated M2, the regions involved in BST-2 downregulation were proposed to be within the M2 extracellular and TMDs.",

PB1-F2 is known to induce apoptosis in host immune cells (Chen et al. 2001 ) via interaction with two mitochondrial proteins, ANT3 and VDAC1, resulting in the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (Varga et al. 2012) , although its localization and pro-apoptotic behavior is strain and cell type specific (Varga and Palese 2011) . In addition, PB1-F2 from pathogenic strains of IAV can be incorporated into the phagolysosomal compartment to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1\u03b2 secretion and causing severe pathophysiology (McAuley et al. 2013) . Also, binding of PB1-F2 of PR8 to MAVS, a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling adaptor anchoring to mitochondria, led to antagonism activity on interferon production (Varga et al. 2012) . Despite these data, the precise role of PB1-F2 in modulation of IAV-induced immunopathogenesis is still unknown.",

Hepatitis C is divided into six genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common and most difficult to treat. Treatment against HCV infection involves drugs targeting both viral and host proteins, e.g., drugs that target NS3/4A protease, the NS5A protein, or the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). However, the rapid turnover of HCV replication (Neumann et al. 1998 ) and the error-prone activity of the HCV RNA polymerase lead to a rapid formation of \"quasi-species\" and therefore resistance to antivirals. Result from a Y2H study to identify direct binary contacts among the ten major viral proteins of the PR8 strain (Shapira et al. 2009 ). This study also detected nine interactions between IAV M2 and host proteins, among them RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, or proteins involved in signaling pathways, or to detect intraviral PPIs; (b) close-up of high-confidence candidate-interacting proteins (HCIPs) associated with multiple IAV strains when M2 was used as bait. Indicated are links to other viral proteins (NP, PB1, and PB2) [adapted from Wang et al. (2017)] HCV encodes a single polyprotein of ~3000 amino acids that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into ten different proteins: three structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). The structural proteins Core (C), E1, and E2 are located in the N-terminal region and form the viral particle (Moradpour and Penin 2013) , whereas NS3 to NS5B are involved in the replication of the viral genome. p7 and NS2 are dispensable for RNA replication but are critical for virion morphogenesis, which requires both structural and nonstructural proteins Steinmann et al. 2007) , although the latter are not packaged in viral particles.",

Coimmunoprecipitation and FRET assays also supported a physical interaction between p7 and NS2 (Popescu et al. 2011) , suggesting a complex between p7, NS2, and E2 mediated by transmembrane interactions. These interactions were proposed to be required to localize NS proteins and the core-containing cLDs to sites of virus assembly. Overall, these studies demonstrated that NS2, together with p7 protein, plays a central organizing role in HCV particle assembly by bringing together viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Although the exact mechanism linking nucleocapsid assembly with envelope acquisition is unknown, p7 and NS2 have been proposed to play a critical role in the migration of core protein and E1-E2 heterodimers to the virion assembly site (Vieyres et al. 2014) .",

Indeed, HCV acts against the host immune system by downregulating interferon (IFN) production, blocking IFN signaling transduction, and impairing IFNstimulated gene (ISG) expression. But even when ISGs are expressed, most ISGs have been reported to be ineffective when overexpressed in virus-infected cells due to unknown mechanisms (Schoggins et al. 2011 ). By constructing a library of mutant HCVs with a 15-nt insertion, p7 was identified as an immune evasion protein that suppresses the antiviral IFN function, forming a complex with the host interferon-inducible protein 6-16 (IFI6-16) that has been verified by coimmunoprecipitation. It was proposed that while IFI6-16 acts to stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential, p7 counteracts by depolarizing the mitochondrial potential, likely through its ion channel activity. Overall, the findings suggest that p7 antagonizes the antiviral responses of IFN by inhibiting the antiviral function of IFI6-16.",

The first coronavirus was isolated in 1937 (IBV), whereas the first human coronavirus (HCoV) was identified in the 1960s.

M protein has three predicted TMDs and a large C-terminal extramembrane domain exposed to the cytoplasm or the interior of the virion. It is this domain that forms contacts with the C-terminal tail of the E protein, although TMD interactions are also likely (Lim and Liu 2001; Hogue and Machamer 2008) . These interactions occur at the ERGIC, the budding compartment of the host cell. Since M-M interactions are major drivers of viral envelope formation, these contacts are likely to be important for particle assembly. The E-M interaction has long been reported in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) by coimmunoprecipitation in virus-infected or virus-transfected cells (Corse and Machamer 2003; Lim and Liu 2001; Maeda et al. 1999) and was proposed to be crucial for the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) and virions. In SARS-CoV, coexpression of M and E in a baculovirus expression system was sufficient for the assembly of VLPs (Ho et al. 2004) . The deletion of the E gene (\u2206E) in the murine coronavirus, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), produced revertants where the M gene appeared to have been duplicated, creating new variants of M protein that lacked most of its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Kuo and Masters 2010) . These results suggested a role for E proteins in \"dispersing or de-aggregating\" M protein during packaging.",

Also, it regulates various cellular responses of host cells, e.g., the upregulation of fibrinogen gene expression , and the increase of IL-8 and NF-B promoter activities (Kanzawa et al. 2006) , possibly through its RNA-binding activity (Sharma et al. 2007 ).

Von Brunn et al. (von Brunn et al. 2007) reported interactions of E protein with the nonstructural proteins nsp1, nsp8, and nsp11, as well as with the accessory proteins ORF3b, ORF7b, and ORF9b, whereas ORF3a interacted with M and S. However, not all these interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Overall, however, only 13% of the intraviral SARS interactions known at that time were identified. This is likely due to the bias of Y2H against membrane proteins, which prevents the transfer of expressed prey and/or bait fusion proteins to the nucleus to activate transcription. Pan et al. (Pan et al. 2008 ) also reported a genome-wide analysis of intraviral PPIs in SARS-CoV replication, using a mammalian two-hybrid system screen, although only two interactions of E and 3a were found here. In comparison with a similar screen in yeast, native posttranslational modifications and folding should be present, but the two methods share a similar limitation in terms of bias against membrane proteins.",

            "text": "The C-terminal tail of SARS-CoV E protein, which includes the proposed PBM, forms a random coil secondary structure (Li et al. 2014a ) in a variety of environments. However, PBMs usually fold as \u03b2-strands (Ye and Zhang 2013) , which suggests that a \u03b2-structure conformation may be induced by target binding. Another similar Y2H study that used the same bait described a similar PDZ domaincontaining binder, the syndecan-binding protein (syntenin) (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al. 2014) . Syntenin is a scaffolding protein that can initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), leading to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The authors showed that the proposed C-terminal PBM in SARS-CoV E protein is a determinant of virulence. Since SARS-CoV-infected patients show an exacerbated inflammatory response that leads to epithelial and endothelial damage, edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the disruption of this pathway may have therapeutic implications. Overall, an involvement of this PBM in E protein in epithelial integrity and inflammatory responses is likely. Several other viruses, e.g., influenza A virus or human papillomavirus, have been described to enhance pathogenesis through viral proteins containing PBMs [reviewed in Javier and Rice (2011)] , which probably constitute a common viral strategy.",

In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that coexpression of SARS-CoV E with human epithelial sodium transporter (ENaC) reduced amiloridesensitive current through PKC activation followed by reduction of ENaC surface levels (Ji et al. 2009 ). A similar direct or indirect inhibitory effect on other endogenous channels was proposed from patch-clamp experiments using SARS-CoV E-transfected cells . For IBV E, interaction with endogenous channels or SNAREs has been suggested to justify the Golgi complex rearrangement in response to IBV E expression (Ruch and Machamer 2011) , although this observation may also involve the IBV E channel itself. For example, ion homeostasis at the Golgi could affect Na + /H + exchangers that are critical for maintaining low luminal pH. Interactions of viroporins with Golgi channels or transporters are largely unexplored in the viroporins field, but notable cases have been already reported. For example, oncogenic protein E5 from papillomavirus (Wetherill et al. 2012 ) is able to bind the 16 K subunit of the lumen-acidifying V-ATPase (Goldstein et al. 1991) , preventing assembly of the pump and leading to alkalinization of the Golgi lumen (Schapiro et al. 2000) .",

It has a single TM \u03b1-helical hydrophobic region, with C-(lumenal or extracellular) and N-terminal (cytoplasmic) extramembrane domains (Collins and Mottet 1993) . The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain forms a short \u03b1-helix (residues 5-14) (Fig. 15.7a) , almost coincident with a \"10-residue\" conserved sequence between hRSV and MuV SH protein sequences. SH proteins in MuV, PIV5, and JPV have extremely short lumenal domains (nine, two, and ten residues, respectively) compared with their much longer N-terminal cytoplasmic domains, which are likely involved in PPIs. The C-terminal extramembrane domain forms an extended \u03b2-hairpin. In bicelles, the \u03b1-helix of the TMD extends up to residue His-51 (Li et al. 2014b) , resulting in both protonatable residues of SH protein, His-22, and His-51, oriented toward the lumen of the channel.

In infected cells, most SH protein accumulates at the membranes of the Golgi complex, but it is also found in the ER or plasma membrane (Rixon et al. 2004 ). SH has potential glycosylation sites in both the C-and N-terminal domains (Collins et al. 1990 ). In infected cells, the SH protein of strain A2 accumulates in four different forms (Olmsted and Collins 1989; Collins et al. 1984; Collins and Mottet 1993) , but the most abundant is a full-length unglycosylated form.

This priming involves the expression of inflammasome components, e.g., NLRP3 and inactive procaspase-1 (Elliott and Sutterwala 2015) . Various virus-induced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) induce the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Another study (Russell et al. 2015) proposed that IL-1\u03b2 is overproduced when SH is absent from RSV. The study also showed attenuation in mice when infected with RSV \u0394SH. That deletion of RSV SH leads to an increase in IL-1\u03b2 is also supported by studies in bovine RSV (bRSV), where a \u0394SH vaccine strain induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs of infected cattle (Taylor et al. 2014) . Consistent with this, lung macrophages infected with RSV did not lead to increased IL-1\u03b2, although other pro-inflammatory cytokines were overexpressed (Ravi et al. 2013) . Overall, it has been proposed (Russell et al. 2015) that SH protein blocks IL-1\u03b2 production, preventing the clearance of infected cells. Indeed, blockade of IL-1\u03b2 prior to infection increased the viral load, supporting the idea that SH might enable immunomodulation. The interaction between SH and G protein has also been shown previously to have an immunomodulatory role .",

BAP31 is a membrane protein located at the ER that has an essential role in sorting newly synthesized membrane proteins. Additionally, BAP31 has a cytoplasmic C-terminus with two coiled coils (Quistgaard et al. 2013 ), one of them containing a variant of the death effector domain (vDED) flanked by two caspase-8 cleavage sites. This domain is excised upon activation of caspase-8 to produce a fragment p20, known to function as a proapoptotic factor (Breckenridge et al. 2003) . This interaction was confirmed using co-transfection, pull-down assay and immunofluorescence colocalization, and also using endogenous BAP31 and was localized to the first N-terminal 44 residues (Li et al. 2015) . When 15 N-labeled SH protein was titrated with cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of human BAP31, major shifts were observed at residues I6, I8, S12, and W15 (Fig. 15.7b) . It can be hypothesized that this interaction could interfere with the interaction between BAP31 and caspase-8, blocking the cleavage sites and preventing conversion to the pro-apoptotic form of BAP31, i.e., p20, thus delaying apoptosis. Incidentally, the viroporin E5 from the high-risk human papillomavirus HPV-16 and HPV-31 was also found to interact with BAP31, where it is similarly thought to regulate apoptosis in addition to its roles in immunomodulation (Regan and Laimins 2008 ) (see below).",

To counteract this host defense mechanism, viral Vpu, 2012)); (c) Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4. Binding of Vpu to CD4 is mediated by the cytoplasmic helices and TM helices. Vpu has two conserved phosphoserines which constitute a binding motif for \u03b2-TrCP, leading to assembly of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (UbL) complex that results in CD4 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (modified from Strebel (2014)) Env, and Nef downmodulate CD4 surface expression [see review in Doms and Trono (2000) ]. Vpu interacts with newly synthesized CD4 at the ER to mediate CD4 degradation (Willey et al. 1992) . Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 requires physical interaction between the two proteins. In CD4, the interaction domain has been mapped to a specific motif (L 414 SEKKT 419 ) and a membrane-proximal \u03b1-helix (Bour et al. 1995) . For Vpu, residues in both cytoplasmic \u03b1-helices of Vpu experienced chemical shift perturbations upon CD4 binding (Fig. 15.8b) (Singh et al. 2012) , although involvement of the TMDs of both proteins has also been suggested (Magad\u00e1n and Bonifacino 2012; Do et al. 2013 ). However, the scrambling or replacement of the whole Vpu TMD appears to have no effect on Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 (Willey et al. 1994; Schubert et al. 1996) , whereas a single amino acid substitution at the TMD, W22 L, abolished CD4 degradation but did not disrupt the CD4-Vpu interaction (Magad\u00e1n and Bonifacino 2012) , suggesting that TM interactions between CD4 and Vpu may function beyond the expected role of stabilizing the protein complex for CD4 degradation.",

Accordingly, a C-terminal Trp residue at the Vpu cytoplasmic tail has been reported to contribute to this displacement of cell surface BST-2 (Lewinski et al. 2015) . Other proposed mechanisms have been proposed, e.g., Vpu can disrupt intracellular BST-2 trafficking by sequestering both newly synthesized and recycling BST-2 within intracellular compartments such as the TGN (Dub\u00e9 et al. 2010; Hauser et al. 2010) . This effectively blocks the resupply of BST-2 to the plasma membrane and thereby reduce BST-2 surface density (Dub\u00e9 et al. 2011) . Vpu-mediated BST-2 mistrafficking has been reported to involve the host clathrin-dependent membrane trafficking pathways which are mediated by clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes (Kueck and Neil 2012; Lau et al. 2011) . It was proposed that Vpu is able to hijack the clathrin-dependent trafficking machinery via a mimicked canonical acidic di-leucine sorting motif (E 59 xxxLV 64 ) within its second cytoplasmic \u03b1-helix to recruit the AP complexes, forming a Vpu-BST-2-AP ternary complex (McNatt et al. 2013; Jia et al. 2014; Kueck et al. 2015) . In addition, the conserved di-phosphoserine motif (D 51 SGxxS 56 ) in Vpu may also be required for this recruitment (Kueck et al. 2015) . A crystal structure of a Vpu CYTO -BST-2 CYTO fusion protein in complex with the AP1 core has been solved (Jia et al. 2014 ). In this model, the cytoplasmic domains of Vpu and BST-2 do not interact directly. Instead, Vpu seems to act as a chaperone to enhance binding of AP1 to BST-2. Stability of this complex is achieved by pair-wise binary interactions between Vpu and BST-2 TMDs and between Vpu and BST-2 cytoplasmic domains to several parts of AP1 (Fig. 15.10) . Thereafter, the Vpu-BST-2 complex is thought to proceed through the clathrin-mediated trafficking pathway for \u03b2-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination of BST-2 before subsequent ESCRTmediated endo-lysosomal degradation.",

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a deadly demyelinating disease of the brain, is attributed to Fig. 15 .10 Schematics of Vpu hijacking of AP1 to target BST2. AP1 is colored by subunit (\u03b21 in gray, \u03b3 in orange, \u03bc1 in green, and \u03c31 in yellow). Vpu CYTO (cyan) binds to the acidic di-leucinebinding pocket of \u03b3/\u03c31, and BST-2 CYTO (magenta) binds to the tyrosine-binding pocket in \u03bc1. Transmembrane helices are represented by cylinders (adapted from Jia et al. (2014)) the human polyomavirus JCV (John Cunningham virus). JCV encodes for a small and highly basic protein called agnoprotein which has important regulatory roles in the JCV replication cycle. Besides JCV, the agnoprotein can also be found in other polyomaviruses including BK virus (BKV) and simian virus 40 (SV40) (Sariyer et al. 2011) . The 71-residue agnoprotein has a central hydrophobic region which has been reported to form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix (Lys23-Phe39) (Coric et al. 2014 ). This helix is characteristically rich in Leu/Ile/Phe, which is required for protein stability and oligomerization (Saribas et al. 2013) . A recently solved NMR structure in organic solvent has revealed a second \u03b1-helix, albeit minor, spanning residues Leu6-Lys13 (Fig. 15 .11) (Coric et al. 2017) .",

It also interacts with cellular proteins, including the Y-box-binding factor 1 (YB-1) , tumor suppressor p53 (Darbinyan et al. 2002) , tubulin (Endo et al. 2003) , DNA damage repair protein Ku70 (Darbinyan et al. 2004) , fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) , heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP-1\u03b1) , protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Sariyer et al. 2008) , and the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP3) \u03b4 subunit (Suzuki et al. 2013 ). Fig. 15 .11 NMR structure of agnoprotein contains two main \u03b1-helical structures (red) and two unstructured regions (yellow) [adapted from Coric et al. (2017)] One of the interesting host factors targeted by the JCV agnoprotein is the AP3 (Suzuki et al. 2013) . Interaction of agnoprotein with the \u03b4 subunit of AP3 (AP3D) appears to hijack the AP3-mediated intracellular vesicular trafficking to prevent the targeted lysosomal degradation of agnoprotein. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the special features of viroporins such as M2 and Vpu, which also manipulate host trafficking pathways. Agnoprotein is then allowed to be translocated to the plasma membrane to act as a viroporin and promote virion release (Suzuki et al. 2013) . Alanine substitutions of two basic residues (Arg8 and Lys9) in the N-terminus of agnoprotein disrupt its viroporin activity (Suzuki et al. 2010a ) and also disrupt binding to AP3D, ensuing its transport to the lysosomes and subsequent lysosomal degradation ( Fig. 15.12) (Suzuki et al. 2013) . These basic residues are part of an ordered helical structure (Coric et al. 2017 ) and may constitute an important regulatory and/ or interaction motif.",

Both WT and RK8AA form homo-oligomers as integral membrane proteins in cytoplasmic organelles. WT disrupts AP3-mediated vesicular trafficking, is translocated to plasma membrane, and functions as a viroporin, resulting in the promotion of virion release. In contrast, the RK8AA mutant fails to bind to AP3D and does not disrupt AP3-mediated vesicular trafficking and is transported to lysosomes and degraded. RK8AA agnoprotein cannot promote virion release and is defective in viral propagation [adapted from Suzuki et al. (2013) ] (Tate et al. 2016) . The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is a 175-amino-acid transmembrane ER glycoprotein and the first virus-encoded enterotoxin to be discovered (Ball et al. 1996) . Besides its primary ER localization, NSP4 can also be secreted as a soluble enterotoxin (Bugarc\u00ec\u0107 and Taylor 2006) or colocalize with the autophagy protein LC3 in cap-like structures that associate with viroplasms (Berkova et al. 2006) .",

Earlier studies reported that NSP4 colocalize with the autophagosome marker LC3 in \"cap-like structures\" associated with viroplasms (Berkova et al. 2006) , sparking interest of whether the host autophagy machinery is manipulated during rotavirus infection. Indeed, NSP4 appears to orchestrate a series of events which ultimately lead to host autophagy. NSP4 viroporin activity at the ER can activate the ER calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which triggers an activation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which in turn facilitates Ca 2+ influx through the plasma membrane (Hyser et al. 2013) . This increase in intracellular Ca 2+ activates the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-\u03b2 (CaMKK-\u03b2) to initiate autophagy (Anderson et al. 1999; Crawford et al. 2012) . The autophagy membrane trafficking pathway is then hijacked by the virus to transport viral proteins from the ER to viroplasms for assembly of infectious virus (Crawford et al. 2012 ). ",

Later studies clarified that the oligomeric status of NSP4 CCD can be regulated by pH and Ca 2+ ; at neutral pH it forms a tetramer that binds Ca 2+ , Fig. 15 .14 Model of NSP4 as a three-pass transmembrane protein. Left: initial ER membrane insertion of NSP4 mediated by uncleaved signal sequence in H2 domain. Lysine residues interact with membrane phospholipid, promoting insertion of the viroporin domain (PD + AD) as an anti-parallel \u03b1-helical hairpin. Center: insertion of the viroporin domain generates a three-pass transmembrane topology. Right: NSP4 oligomerization around the amphipathic \u03b1-helix generates an aqueous pore for the passage of ER Ca 2+ [adapted from Hyser et al. (2010)] but at low pH it forms a pentamer that does not bind Ca 2+ (Sastri et al. 2014) . While the NSP4 CCD appears to be an interaction hotspot, it remains to be revealed how environmental cues may influence its binding conformations and affinity with interaction partners. For instance, the CCD may act as a cytoplasmic pH/Ca 2+ sensor that alters the NSP4 oligomeric state and conformation to regulate its binding to a certain interaction partner, or Ca 2+ may even act as a cofactor for binding.",

High-risk HPVs, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18, are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions. The HPV-16 E5 (16E5), a small hydrophobic oncoprotein, is a recent addition to the viroporin family as it exhibits ion channel activity in vitro (Wetherill et al. 2012) . 16E5 is an 83-residue protein with three putative TMDs and an N-terminal luminal, C-terminal cytoplasmic topology (Krawczyk et al. 2010 ). 16E5 monomers oligomerize as homodimers or hexamers (Kell et al. 1994; Gieswein et al. 2003; Wetherill et al. 2012 ). 16E5 has roles in cellular transformation, mitogenic signaling, immune evasion, intracellular protein trafficking, and apoptosis [reviewed in M\u00fcller et al. (2015) ].",

For instance, 16E5 can help HPV escape from immunesurveillance by downregulating expression of antigen-presenters at the host cell surface. 16E5 binds and retains MHC-I in the ER and Golgi to prevent its trafficking to the cell surface, in an interaction involving two leucine pairs in the first TMD (TM1) of 16E5 and the heavy chain of MHC-I (Ashrafi et al. 2005; Cortese et al. 2010; Ashrafi et al. 2006) . The TM1 of 16E5 may also bind and cripple the function of the MHC-I chaperone, Bap31 (Ladasky et al. 2006; Regan and Laimins 2008; Cortese et al. 2010 ). Intriguingly, a motif consisting of ten identical residues between the 16E5 TM1 and Bap31 TM3 has been discovered ( Fig. 15.15 ) and could represent a case of molecular piracy used by 16E5 to displace Bap31 from MHC-I. In addition, 16E5-mediated ER retention of MHC-I may also involve an interaction with the ER chaperone calnexin, since surface downregulation of MHC-I is not observed in calnexin-deficient cells (Gruener et al. 2007 ). In the same study, a triprotein complex of 16E5, MHC-I, and calnexin could be obtained based on a coimmunoprecipitation assay. The 16E5-calnexin interaction also reduced CD1d surface levels by retaining it in the ER and subsequently redirecting it for proteasomal degradation (Miura et al. 2010 ).",

The interaction between E5 and PDGF\u03b2R is also highly specific, since cooperation was not observed between E5 and PDGF\u03b1R, a closely related receptor tyrosine kinase (Goldstein et al. 1994) . Molecular dynamics experiments have proposed a model of the E5 dimer, where the Gln17 of monomer 1 and the Asp33 of monomer 2 are on the same face of the dimer that interacts with a molecule of PDGF\u03b2R (Surti et al. 1998) . NMR studies of E5 peptides in detergent micelles also favor E5 dimerization for complex formation with PDGF\u03b2R through its TMD (King et al. 2011 ). ",

For efficient viral replication, the virus must be resourceful in harnessing or disabling the host cellular machinery. In recent years, the role of viroporins as essential players in viral pathogenesis has been established. However, in addition to disrupting cellular ion homeostasis by their channel activity, viroporins also interact with host factors and coordinate with other viral proteins in structural roles. The structural features of these complexes remain poorly understood. Advances in this field will provide useful insights in the design of new antivirals.",
