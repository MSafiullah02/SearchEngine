The CTLD, referred to as a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) in cases where carbohydrates are recognised, comprises a distinctive, compact protein fold arising from disulphide bridges formed between six conserved canonical cysteine residues [1] and is marked by its ability to recognise a diverse repertoire of structurally dissimilar microbe-associated or endogenous ligands. Classical CLRs constitute the largest and most diverse group and bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner. These C-type lectins harbour mannose-binding EPN (Glu-Pro-Asn) or galactose-binding QPD (Gln-Pro-Asp) triplets in their CRDs [2]. Their non-classical counterparts, while being structurally homologous, lack the residues required for calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding and are referred to as C-type lectin-like receptors (CLLRs) [3]. These receptors either use alternative mechanisms in carbohydrate recognition or recognise non-carbohydrate ligands such as proteins.",

These receptors play critical roles in enabling NK cell discrimination between self, non-self, missing-self and induced self where they regulate the fine balance between NK cell activation and inhibition. Many of these receptors are group-II and -V C-type lectins which are also expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage including neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes and macrophages.

Independent control of Ly49 gene transcription allows for mono-allelic expression on overlapping subsets of NK cells and T-lymphocytes. Members of the Ly49 family recognize polymorphic epitopes on H-2D and H-2K Class I MHC molecules and play important roles in regulating NK cytotoxicity, where cells inappropriately expressing reduced cell surface Class I MHC or related molecules are destroyed [6]. The Ly49 family includes activating receptors such as Ly49D and Ly49H (Official name: Klra8) which associate with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor proteins such as DNAX Activating Protein of 12 kDa (DAP-12) (Fig. 1C). Inhibitory receptors within this family include Ly49Q which harbour immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic domains. ITIM tyrosine phosphorylation results in the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, the inhibition of cytokine production, the suppression of NK cytotoxicity and the consequent prevention of self-killing of target cells by NK cells [7\u20139]. Furthermore, activating and inhibitory Ly49 receptors may be expressed simultaneously allowing for the selective elimination of virus-infected or transformed target cells that show lost or reduced expression of inhibitory receptor ligand but retain the expression of ligand for activating receptors [10].",

The human NKC also encodes group V CLRs such as CD69, CD94 and members of the NKG2 family which recognise HLA-E or ligands expressed on stressed, virally infected or tumourigenic cells [5,11] (Fig. 1). Many NKC-encoded CLR genes expressed in myeloid cells occur in two distinct clusters: The dectin-1 cluster includes genes encoding group V CLRs such as dectin-1, lectin-like receptor for low density lipoprotein-1 (LOX-1), myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL), C-type lectin-like receptor (CLEC)-1, CLEC-2, CLEC-9A and macrophage antigen h (MAH) (CLEC-12B) [12,13] (Fig. 1). Group V CLRs are non-classical type II trans-membrane proteins harbouring a single CTLD, a stalk region of variable length and a cytoplasmic tail which may contain consensus signalling motifs. The dectin-2 cluster which occurs centromeric to the NKC includes genes encoding group II CLRs including dectin-2, CLECS-F8, Mincle, BDCA-2, DCAR and DCIR (Fig. 1). Group II CLRs are generally classical C-type lectins with similar structures to those of group V CLRs but have shorter cytoplasmic tails [3].",

Following ligand binding and receptor clustering, the tyrosine residues of an ITAM (YxxI/Lx(6\u201312)YxxI/L) are phosphorylated by Src family kinases which in turn promote the recruitment of Syk family kinases [14\u201317].

            "text": "Several examples also exist of ITIM-bearing receptors paradoxically mediating cellular activation. In such cases, the receptors may recruit novel substrates to their cytoplasmic domains or they may inhibit other inhibitory receptors in a more conventional SHP-1/2-dependent manner: the platelet co-stimulatory ITIM receptor TREM-like transcript-1 (TLT-1) recruits SHP-2 yet augments Fc\u025bRI-mediated calcium signalling. It has been suggested that this may be mediated by a unique poly-proline-rich region in TLT-1 which could recruit SH3 domain-containing substrates [29]. Another example is that of signal regulatory protein-\u03b1 (Sirp-\u03b1), a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) [30\u201335] that is expressed on myeloid cells and neurons [36\u201341]. Binding of SIRP-\u03b1 to its widely expressed endogenous ligand, CD47 has both inhibitory as well as activating effects. The inhibitory effects, mediated by the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 [42\u201346] include the inhibition of red blood cell phagocytosis by macrophages [43] and the inhibition of DC maturation and cytokine production [40]. The activating effects of this ITIM-bearing receptor may be mediated by the recruitment of JAK-2 to its cytoplasmic C-terminal tyrosine. This triggers the JAK-2/STAT, PI3K/Rac-1/NADPH oxidase/H2O2 pathways, enhancing the retention of SHP-1 and SHP-2 and abrogating their inhibitory effects [47]. In this regard, SIRP-\u03b1 has been shown to play a role in the promotion of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation by DCs [41], the induction of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production in macrophages [47] as well as the development of Th17-driven auto-immune diseases such as contact hypersensitivity, collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [48\u201350].",

It is a type II trans-membrane glycoprotein comprising an extracellular C-terminal CTLD, a stalk, trans-membrane region and an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1G). The CTLD of human MICL (hMICL) shares \u223c30% identity with that of other dectin-1 cluster CLLRs (Fig. 1), and 49% identity with the CTLD of murine MICL (mMICL) [54,55]. Marshall et al. [53] also reported three alternatively spliced hMICL isoforms \u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03b3 (Fig. 2A). The \u03b2-isoform lacks the exon encoding the trans-membrane region while the \u03b3-isoform has a stop codon after the exon encoding the trans-membrane region. The extracellular portion of hMICL comprises six potential N-glycosylation sites with the two most C-terminal sites of the stalk region contributing the majority of cell-specific N-glycosylation. This feature is thought to prevent its dimerisation despite the presence of two conserved cysteine residues [53,56]. In contrast, mMICL has one less stalk N-glycosylation site and has been reported to exist as a dimer.",

However, in the presence of TLR agonists or T-lymphocyte-dependent CD40L signalling hMICL ligation appeared to have different effects on DCs. Here, TLR-induced IL-12 expression and the induction of Th1 cells was suppressed by hMICL cross-linking while in response to CD40L signalling, IL-12 production and Th1 polarization was enhanced by hMICL ligation [54]. Similar antibody-mediated cross-linking approaches had no effects on primary murine leukocyte responses [55]. This, together with differences in the ability of hMICL and mMICL to dimerise as well as the broader cellular distribution of mMICL suggests that these orthologues may play different roles in vivo as homeostatic receptors.",

Here, DCIR deficiency was associated with the spontaneous development of a late onset disease resulting in joint abnormalities. Histologically, this was characterised by enthesitis and sialadenitis as well as elevated levels of auto-antibodies. Moreover, these animals showed increased populations of DCs and activated CD4+ T cells. Young DCIR\u2212/\u2212 mice were susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis marked by excessive DC expansion in the lymph nodes, an increase in cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 as well as increased IgG1 and IgG3 production. In support of the role of excessive DCIR\u2212/\u2212 DC expansion in collagen-induced arthritis, the authors also reported enhanced DCIR\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) proliferation in response to GM-CSF and enhanced STAT-5 phosphorylation suggesting that DCIR negatively regulated DC expansion and GM-CSF signalling [69]. In human studies, rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with the widespread and abundant expression of DCIR in NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocytes, B cells, DCs and granulocytes suggesting that synovial inflammation induces DCIR expression. Furthermore, DCIR+ T-cells in synovial fluid were activated and found with a greater abundance as compared with peripheral blood. However, the function of DCIR within this T lymphocyte population remains as yet unknown [70].",

Here it plays a critical role in the development of tubular endolysosomes during intracellular trafficking of TLR9 and its ligand, CpG. This is achieved by the internalisation of Ly49Q in cis with its class I MHC ligand, a process dependent upon the ITIM-mediated recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 [78]. The mechanism by which this so-called \u201cinhibitory\u201d CLR increases IFN\u03b1 production in response to TLR-7 and -9 agonists remains unknown although it may be occurring in the presence of inhibitory DAP-12 coupled-receptors in pDCs or the Ly49Q ITIM may be acting as an ITAM under these conditions [79].",

            "text": "Recently, the role of Ly49Q in osteoclast development (osteoclastogenesis) has been investigated [80]. RANKL (Receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand) stimulation of bone marrow-derived monocyte-macrophage precursor cells resulted in selective Ly49Q induction. Following short hairpin RNA knockdown of Ly49Q, there was a significant impairment of osteoclastogenesis in vitro as well as a significant reduction in the formation of RANKL-induced tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells and reduced expression of osteoclast-specific genes [80]. In this context it has been suggested that Ly49Q promotes osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting an inhibitory receptor. Here, it may compete for SHP-1 association with another paired ITIM-bearing receptor, immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIR-B), which is a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation [80]. This highlights one of the mechanisms by which ITIM-harbouring receptors can activate cellular responses. A mouse Ly49Q knock-out had no effects on bone volume, osteoclast differentiation or function suggesting that a compensatory mechanism may exist for Ly49Q deficiency in vivo\n[80]. Interestingly, recent data demonstrating the ability of human monocyte-derived osteoclasts to function as antigen-presenting cells and to activate T-lymphocytes may point to additional roles for Ly49Q in this respect and merits further investigation [81]. While Ly49Q may function as a positive regulator of osteoclast differentiation, another C-type-like lectin-like NK receptor, osteoclast inhibitory lectin (OCIL) has been identified as an inhibitor of osteoclast development.",

In addition to the CTLD, the extracellular domain includes a neck region and a C-terminal extension as well as three potential N-glycosylation sites and five conserved cysteine residues [82].

OCIL expression is regulated by hormones and cytokines active in bone including retinoic acid, IL-1\u03b1, IL-11, calcitriol and parathyroid hormone (PTH). While RANKL is an established promoter of osteoclastogenesis, OCIL and other family members inhibit osteoclast formation primarily in the proliferative phase and in a manner that is neither dependent on osteoprotegerin (OPG) nor on the ability of OCIL to bind sulphated glycosaminoglycans [83]. Unlike Ly49Q, where knockout studies showed functional redundancy in the ability to promote osteoclastogenesis, Kartsogiannis et al. [87] found that OCIL-deficient mice, while showing no apparent defect in immune function, displayed phenotypic abnormalities in bone physiology. This was characterised by increased osteoclastogenesis and reduced bone formation confirming the role of OCIL as a negative regulator of bone homeostasis. In addition to this, and independent of its effects on osteoclasts, OCIL also inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes [88].",

However, unlike these receptors, MAFA does not bind class I MHC ligands although it is able to bind mannose-terminated glycans [98,99]. MAFA comprises a short cytoplasmic tail which harbours an ITIM (SIYSTL) that differs at the Y-2 position from the canonical ITIM sequences present in most other inhibitory receptors. The cytoplasmic tail also includes a PAAP motif that is able to bind SH3-domain-containing proteins such as the protein tyrosine kinase Lyn, the recruitment of which is an important step in ITIM phosphorylation [100,101]. Antibody-mediated MAFA clustering induced ITIM tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-2 and SHIP but not SHP-1 as is the case with many other ITIM-bearing receptors [100,102]. SHIP is the principal mediator of MAFA's inhibitory function where the hydrolysis of PIP3, the decrease in PLC-\u03b3 activity, and the inhibition of transient intracellular calcium elevation, suppressed the secretory response to Fc\u025bRI activation [100,103]. Notably, unlike other inhibitory receptors, MAFA-mediated inhibition does not require co-clustering with Fc\u025bRI although such co-clustering potentiated its inhibitory capacity [104,105]. In this regard, it has been shown that MAFA functions within membrane lipid raft microdomains and in close proximity to Fc\u025bRI [106\u2013108]. Other functions of MAFA include an involvement in mast cell adhesion [95,96,109] and the inhibition of mast cell proliferation [102].",

Unlike rat MAFA, it is absent from mast cells but is expressed on a subset of memory T cells in na\u00efve mice. Furthermore, klrg1 expression was induced on CD8+ T-lymphocytes during viral and parasitic infection and on CD4+ T-lymphocytes during parasitic infection [111]. Cytokine activation of NK cells also induced Klrg1 expression where it may inhibit NK cell effector functions [111,112]. The human MAFA-like receptor (MAFA-L) (KLRG1) is expressed on peripheral blood NK cells but unlike its rat counterpart, it may inhibit responses to receptors other than Fc\u025bRI [113].",

In the present review we have highlighted some of the important and increasingly diverse and complex roles of inhibitory C-type lectin receptors in these cell populations. The ability of these receptors to paradoxically activate cellular responses under certain circumstances underscores their versatility in response to alterations in receptor ligation, cellular compartmentalisation, receptor co-localisation and the ability of ITIMs to recruit both inhibitory proteins and to modulate activating molecules. Knock-down and knock-out studies have provided valuable insights into the functioning of these receptors in vivo including the extent of their functional redundancy. Efforts to similarly elucidate the in vivo functions of other CLRs such as MICL and MAH as well as attempts at identifying their endogenous and/or exogenous ligands promises to increase our understanding of their roles as regulators of immune homeostasis.",

The murine NKC comprises genes located on chromosome 6F3 and spans a region of approximately 2.5 Mb. In humans, its equivalent is located on chromosome 12p13.1. The dectin-1 cluster (black dashed square) comprises genes encoding group V CLRs including MICL (G), CLEC-2, CLEC-9A, MAH (H), CLEC-1, dectin-1 (B) and LOX-1. The dectin-2 cluster (black dotted square) comprises genes centromeric to the NKC which encode group II CLRs including BDCA-2, DCAR (A), DCIR (D), dectin-2, CLECSF8 and Mincle. The murine Ly49 family (black solid square) includes both activating receptors such as Ly49H (C) and inhibitory receptors such as Ly49Q (I). Genes encoding MAFA/KLRG1 (humans) and its murine orthologue (klrg1) are highlighted in solid grey squares. Names in italics represent genes present in humans but absent from the mouse NKC. Upper panels show activating receptors and bottom panels show inhibitory receptors, both in order of chromosomal localisation from left (centromeric) to right (telomeric).

Activating receptor substrates such as Src and Syk kinases and inhibitory receptor substrates such as protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1,-2 and SHIP are also shown.
