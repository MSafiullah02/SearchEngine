After rapid spread in the Lombardy region of Italy, the first 2019-nCoV cases appeared in Switzerland, including a young woman working at a daycare center, who tested positive in Basel on February 27 after traveling to Milan.

Scheduled maintenance on the linear accelerators (LINACs) and unfinished upgrade procedures were reviewed. Elective maintenance work scheduled after mid-April 2020 was postponed, whereas all necessary maintenance was carried out as soon as possible. Planned procedures such as software upgrades were postponed to limit the risk of potential hardware incompatibilities and software bugs during the critical phase. 4.

In many of these patients, treatment can be postponed for several weeks or even months without negative oncologic impact. Therefore, time slots for therapy initiation for patients scheduled to undergo treatment, and for those presenting for the first time, were reviewed. Three elective slots per week for treatment initiation were reserved and filled up continuously beginning mid-July. Restricting the number of treatment initiations ensured that not too many patients with a nonetime-critical treatment would be \"on beam\" at the same time. Patients were advised to immediately initiate scheduled hormone and androgen deprivation therapy, when indicated. 2. Over 70% of all patients with breast and primary prostate cancer were already receiving hypofractionated treatment before the 2019-nCoV outbreak, mostly according to the Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy trial for breast cancer 3 and the Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer trial for prostate cancer. 4 In view of the impending outbreak, hypofractionated RT was employed whenever feasible, including implementation of a 1-week partial breast RT schedule in suitable patients, following recent presentation of favorable long-term outcomes. 5,6 3. Patients with slow-growing asymptomatic tumors (eg, World Health Organization grade I meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas) were assigned treatment slots at a later time point. 4. Palliative RT was delivered using short regimens whenever feasible, and single-fraction stereotactic body RT was considered for cases where a higher biologically effective dose (BED 10Gy ) was deemed necessary, such as in bone metastases with a mass effect and possible future complications. 5. Provisions were made to reduce quality assurance (QA) measures as far as deemed reasonable and allowed according to the radiation protection regulations. Generally, patient-specific QA is performed using in vitro dosimetry for verification of intensity modulated RT treatment plans in each case. Once resources (staff, LINAC slots) become limited, only highly modulated plans will be checked, and this practice will be suspended for plans deemed to be of low risk for any inconsistencies, based on experience gathered in past years, including the departmental critical incidence reporting system.",

In our case, 1 week after the first departmental contingency plans had been developed, the hospital administration allocated 1.0 full-time equivalent physician from our department to the newly installed 2019-nCoV outpatient testing station. Another 0.5 full-time equivalent administrative worker was allocated the following week. This practice is scheduled to continue as the strain on the health care system intensifies and will require further adaptations to departmental workflows. 2. Personnel supporting our department may become unavailable. Affected services may involve facility care, logistics, information and communications technology, and patient transportation. We plan to employ the department's administrative staff to carry out some of these tasks, should these services no longer be provided by the hospital. Other nonetime-critical tasks currently covered by the administrative staff, such as billing, would have to be postponed until the situation improves. With academic sessions paused, the medical faculty has issued a call to medical students to assist in various supporting tasks; at the time of writing, over 100 students have answered the call. 3. Certain procedures in brachytherapy may require regional or general anesthesia. Many of these indications are not time critical, such as brachytherapy for prostate cancer, and can therefore be postponed. In our case, 4 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer are currently receiving external beam RT and are scheduled to undergo high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the following weeks. Because we expect resources for anesthesia to be limited, options for sedoanalgesia need to be discussed with patients and coordinated. As a last resort, delivery of increased doses using external beam RT may be considered, although this is linked to less favorable outcomes. 7",

One of the biggest challenges we envisioned was the eventuality of having patients on treatment who tested positive for 2019-nCoV. For patients quarantined for confirmed or possible 2019-nCoV infection, hospital regulations called for decontamination of the LINAC vault and patient transit areas in a lengthy procedure, which was not feasible between regular appointments. Rather, this appeared manageable only if a few patients were affected; their treatment slots could be moved to the end of the day, followed by decontamination overnight. The following measures were taken to mitigate the risks: Treatment interruption may be discussed with certain patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. A common scenario may be the treatment of bone metastases using, for example, 5 \u00c2 5 Gy. Were a 2019-nCoV infection to be detected halfway through treatment, RT could be safely discontinued because a delivered dose of !10 Gy should be adequate for analgesia and for temporary prevention of tumor growth in noncritical cases. Treatment could then be restarted after a few weeks, with the option of delivering a higher cumulative dose to account for the interruption.",

Remote measures taken in response to typical RT side effects include consultation, faxing of drug prescriptions to nearby pharmacies, use of video calls to assess skin reactions, and scheduling of additional phone calls.

French authorities shut down schools on March 9, and Swiss and German authorities followed on March 16. In anticipation, all coworkers with children had been asked how they planned to take care of their children if schools, kindergartens, and daycare facilities were to close. A provisional plan was to convert a breakroom into an impromptu daycare facility for coworkers, although this idea was abandoned in light of hospital regulations issued on March 13 disallowing visitors on hospital grounds.
