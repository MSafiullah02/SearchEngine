Antigen detection is faster but less sensitive.12 Molecular screening based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is fast, more sensitive than earlier test methods, highly specific, and capable of detecting rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, which are missed by other tests.13 Molecular assays have been reported to improve the diagnostic yield compared with conventional methods during acute respiratory illnesses in patients with hematological malignancies.14, 15, 16, 17 However, they detect only nucleic acids, as opposed to live organisms, and their clinical relevance is therefore unclear.

Continuous variables were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon test, as appropriate. Associations between patient characteristics and positive MMA results were assessed using a logistic regression model. Multivariable analysis was performed using stepwise forward selection to introduce variables yielding P values smaller than 0.20 by univariate analysis. We also introduced variables that seemed clinically relevant. Then, the absence of a significant increase in the likelihood value after omission of each of the remaining variables was checked. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were computed. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

The significance of a positive MMA in immunocompromised patients with ARF cannot be determined from our data. In our study cohort, the need for life-supporting interventions and the mortality rate were both low in MMA-positive patients, but neither was significantly different from that in MMA-negative patients. The clinical and radiographic presentations were also similar. A positive MMA with negative results of other tests for viruses has been associated with lower viral loads and fewer respiratory symptoms compared to concomitant detection by MMA and other tests. Thus, PCR-based methods may help to detect asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic stages of RV infections.14 Studies have established that RVs including PIV, hMPV, and rhinoviruses are sometimes detected by MMA in respiratory samples from symptom-free HSCT, indicating that asymptomatic RV shedding can occur.16, 17, 23 RV shedding lasts longer in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients,17, 24, 25, 26 and a positive MMA may merely indicate a low level of shedding of limited clinical significance. Therefore, in some of our patients, a positive MMA may have indicated asymptomatic shedding unrelated to the cause of the ARF. Finally, MMAs detect only the nucleic acids of RVs, so that a positive MMA can be related to sample contamination.",

Thus, in immunocompromised patients with ARF, the MMA may identify patients with probable viral pulmonary involvement, a diagnosis associated with better outcomes than those assumed to be present when all tests are inconclusive. Indeed, negative tests for the cause of ARF constitute a major diagnostic criterion for severe non-infectious conditions such as drug-related pulmonary toxicity or pulmonary infiltration by the malignancy. Consequently, MMA may deserve to be added to the list of investigations performed routinely to detect the cause of ARF. Isn't so, every effort should be done to make the difference between a positive test and a diagnostic test. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with lung infections, there were no significant differences between MMA-positive and MMA-negative patients. When there is a known bacterial or fungal lung infection, identifying an RV probably has no major impact on the management strategy or patient outcome. An RV may act merely as a risk factor for other infections or play a role in generating ARF, either alone or in conjunction with a bacterial or fungal infection.",

The high frequency of RVs detection does not appear to have significant impact on patients' presentation and outcomes. This may be particularly true in our cohort of critically ill patients. To gain insight into the clinical significance of a positive MMA, routinely performing the MMA on both BAL fluid and NPA and/or obtaining lung biopsies might have been of interest. Histology can show a cytopathic effect but lacks sensitivity. Positive results are difficult to interpret, and no criteria are available for determining the causal role for the RV in the lung disease. High viral loads are more often accompanied with clinical disease, but low viral loads do not exclude clinical disease due to the virus. Moreover, the pathogenesis of viral infection depends not only on intrinsic viral pathogenicity, but also on genetic host factors such as those involved in the immune response. For rhinoviruses in particular, the clinical manifestations may reflect the immune response to the infection rather than the viral cytopathic effect.27\n",
