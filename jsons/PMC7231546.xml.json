The pandemic has its origins in the emergence, late in 2019, of a novel coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has a population of around 11 million. It is estimated that between the official confirmation of the outbreak and the imposition of a lockdown, around 5 million people left the city. The vast majority went to other parts of China.1 The epidemiological implication of this is that the Chinese population outside Wuhan came into contact with many more people infected with COVID-19 than did the world outside China. Despite this, as of 14 April 2020, around 5 months later, China\u2019s total number of cases is 83 306, and its daily case rate is close to zero. By contrast, the global total of cases is now approaching 2 million and doubling every few days in many places.2 Compared with other countries, China has been very successful at controlling the spread of COVID-19.\n1\n\n",

Its success depends on identifying cases (usually people with symptoms) quickly, gathering information from them about recent contacts and following up and quarantining those contacts to interrupt further transmission of the disease. COVID-19 presents a problem for contact tracing as usually practiced because around 50% of transmissions happen early in infection, before symptoms start, and before test results can be acted on. This means that COVID-19 moves too quickly through the population to be amenable to standard contact tracing methods. The use of a mobile phone app that captures \u2018proximity events\u2019\u2014events in which two mobile phones have been close enough for sufficient time for the risk of infection to be high\u2014offers the potential for instantaneous contact tracing from the moment the infection is confirmed.\n3\n This has the potential to stop the pandemic.",

It is important to highlight the fact that in addition to those who have died very much larger numbers of people will be suffering symptoms sufficiently serious to warrant hospitalisation and intensive care. In low-income and middle-income countries in which health systems will often not have these facilities, the impact will be much greater.4 We are far from the end of the COVID-19 pandemic: these numbers will continue to rise for quite some time.",

This is justified insofar as there is insufficient accurate, reliable information about the risk status of individuals or specific locations, which would enable more finely-tuned decisions to be made reliably. The justification of blanket lockdowns would be weaker were it possible to manage physical distancing in a more evidence-based, risk-adjusted way.5 Were this so, it would remain the case that limiting the movements of those people who presented a high risk would be justified. It would not, however, be justified to restrict the movements of those individuals (and possibly populations) who were reliably known not to be contributing to this risk. Rapid contact tracing enabled by the mobile phone app described above\u2014combined with accurate testing\u2014has the potential to be a tool of this kind. The evidence suggests the app has the potential to enable some (likely many) people to return more quickly to their lives. This evidence puts pressure on justifications for blanket lockdowns. The harms presented by such lockdowns also provide support for an argument that the development and implementation of the app as part of a broader package of public health interventions is not only ethically acceptable but also\u2014where feasible\u2014obligatory.\n4\n The app is preferable to blanket lockdowns because intelligent physical distancing constitutes the minimum imposition compatible with addressing the epidemic safely.",

Against that background, the use of a mobile phone app built on the gathering and sharing of proximity information, even if pseudonymised, may be seen as deeply concerning, particularly in combination with other socially restrictive measures. Two important questions requiring clarification in this regard are: what is the nature of the infringement of privacy, if there is one, and, can this be justified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic?",

            "text": "Starting with the question of justification, it seems clear now that some privacy infringements are potentially justifiable where they have the potential to contribute to the saving of many lives and reducing enormous suffering. Imagine a scale running from 0 to 100. At the 0 end of the scale would be someone (Person A) for whom privacy is the concern that trumps all others. People at this end of the scale would place privacy above all other concerns and would be unwilling to give up any privacy to achieve another goal, no matter how important. A person at the other end of the scale would be someone (Person Z) who has no interest at all in privacy and would willingly give up 100% of their privacy for any reason. Person A\u2019s view is likely to be a minority position with regard to this pandemic. The scale of the suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic means that if a case can be made that some degree of privacy infringement will save significant numbers of lives and reduce suffering, the intervention may be justified. Any such justification will depend on a clear case being made that the privacy infringement is either necessary or that it is significantly more effective than the alternatives. One aspect of a convincing attempt at justification might be the claim that the privacy infringement is less intrusive than blanket population level lockdowns for everyone. It would, however, also require a convincing case to be made that (i) any privacy impact would be minimised, (ii) that high standards of data security, protection and oversight would be in place, (iii) that there would be transparency about proposed and actual data uses, and (iv) that these would be complemented by other protections, for example, around non-discrimination. This is a useful reminder that Person Z\u2019s is also an ethically problematic position. Of course, an important concern for many people will not only be about their privacy today during the epidemic, but also about their future privacy: will full privacy protections be reinstated after the epidemic? Will data gathered now be used in unacceptable ways later? This final point highlights, importantly, the fact that any justification of infringements of privacy will need to include a convincing account of their scope and duration.",

It also implies that there may be a tension or trade-off between them. Would it, for example, be ethically justified to retain/impose a blanket lockdown on society as a whole - including those not at risk themselves or a risk to others - on privacy grounds alone? Much would depend on the details of the scope of the privacy infringement. However, its potential use in enabling many people now, and ultimately all, to emerge safely from a damaging lockdown provides a strong autonomy-based prima facie argument in favour of the introduction and use of the app even if it were considered to constitute a privacy infringement. It is worth noting that there are at least two ways in which the use of the app has the potential to be autonomy enhancing. The first is its potential to enable people to go about their lives freely without the constraints imposed by a lockdown. The second is that it would provide a tool to enable individual people to make informed choices about how to behave in a socially responsible way e.g. to self-isolate as necessary to reduce the risks to others.",

This is a possibility given that it is believed that an uptake of below 50% would still - in combination with other measures - be sufficient to make an important impact. There are a number of reasons why those who have smartphones will have a strong incentive to sign up. The first of these is that this would ultimately mean that they and everyone else will emerge from the lockdown more quickly and safely. A second is that, by so doing, they will then be enabled to contribute to saving the lives of others, particularly the vulnerable, and those in caring roles, both locally and globally. Appeals to a sense of \u2018we are all in this together\u2019 of \u2018solidarity\u2019 may be effective.\n6\n A third, is related to the impact on the user\u2019s own level of risk. Although primarily aimed at population level impacts, if a person downloads the app - and so do their close contacts - their personal risk will be very significantly reduced.

Against this background of the scale of the current lockdown, the use of incentives to minimise the length of lockdown while also saving lives might be justified if uptake was insufficient and that there was evidence that greater uptake would release large numbers of people from an avoidable lockdown. The nature of these incentives would need careful consideration on a case-by-case basis. Some possible examples might include: a donation to a nomiated charity, or free mobile phone credit. The use of incentives inevitably raises a number of equity questions with regard to those who do not have access to suitable smartphones and would not have access to these benefits through this route.

It is not an ethically unproblematic course of action, however.

Against this background, it is clear that we have responsibilities not only to those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 but also to future generations. If the app is adopted as an intervention, the data it produces could be an invaluable resource for the protection of future generations from serious harm i.e. through research, the development of modelling methods and evaluation of the range of current responses.

These can take the form of bias within the technology itself (perhaps because of biased data), biases arising out of the uses to which the technology is put and bias out of the fact that it may be available to some but not all.6 7 The response to COVID-19 has been no different to previous public health emergencies in this regard.8 Against this background, an important requirement for the credibility of any attempt to justify the use of the mobile phone app as part of a wider set of public health interventions to address the threat of COVID-19 will be recognition of the importance of engaging seriously with equity and justice issues.

If it turns out to be the case that the use of instantaneous contact tracing combined with widespread testing is effective, questions will arise about the ethical implications for its use in other infectious disease outbreaks. Would it, for example, be acceptable or even required for a specifically designed app to be used each year in the context of seasonal influenza? These are important ethical questions. Although there are differences, there are also morally significant similarities between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. For example, while its transmission rate is generally lower than COVID-19, the numbers of deaths internationally from seasonal influenza are very large indeed.9 One important difference, at present, between the two diseases is that mechanisms capable of developing a vaccine each year with some degree of effectiveness against seasonal influenza are in place. This may suggest that, unless judged less harmful or more effective than vaccination, the use of the app in seasonal influenza may not be justified. However, it is possible that apps will be appropriate in other settings and, where likely to be effective, constitute an important and ethically justified part of the public health toolkit.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have set out a number of pressing ethical questions raised by the proposed use of a mobile phone app, the collection of proximity data for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the safe emergence of populations from government-imposed lockdowns. Scientific and epidemiological evidence suggest that an app of this kind has the potential to contribute to reducing the suffering caused by the pandemic and minimise the harms caused by long periods of lockdown. These benefits and the avoidance of harms are clearly of great moral significance. If they are to be realised, however, several other ethical requirements need to be met. We have highlighted a number of such requirements which deserve attention in any ethically justified use of this technological intervention. In the UK, there is early empirical evidence that a high proportion of the population would choose to download the app under current circumstances, given adequate protections. In an on-line survey of predicted user-acceptance conducted by our collaborators, 74% of respondents said they would definitely or probably install a contact-tracing app.10 Before they are invited to do so, they need to be assured that adequate protections and oversight are in place. A profoundly important ethical question presented by this technology concerns the problem of how and whether societies can find ways to benefit from the potential of algorithmic approaches to improve public and individual health,while also ensuring that the legacy of the deployment of these technologies does not impact negatively on future generations.",
