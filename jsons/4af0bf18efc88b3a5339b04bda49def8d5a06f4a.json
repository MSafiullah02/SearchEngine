We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity ( Figure 2 of the original article 7 ) that are classified into low-(no and low oxygen supplement), medium-(non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up.

This also accounts for why the rate of discharge in the treated group was lower for the medium-risk state than the control group because a substantial proportion of patients regressing from medium-risk to low-risk state in the treated group during hospitalization. The similar logic is applied to the identical discharge rate between the two groups given the modest regression rate from high-risk to medium-risk state. Figure 2 shows the cumulative probabilities of discharge (Figure 2 (A) ) and death (Figure 2(B) ) by the two treatment groups during the 28-day follow-up since enrolment. A higher probability of discharge and a lower probability of death were noted for the treated group (green). The use of remdesivir led to a statistically significantly 29% reduction of death (relative risk: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). When the high-risk state and death was combined as the endpoint, the corresponding reduction was still statistically significant up to 39% (relative risk: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.58-0.63)). The cumulative discharge probability was 58.6% (95% CI:",

Firstly, we improved the weakness of a lacking control group in the original study as a proportion of COVID-19 patients may be discharged with the recovery dispensing with the use of remdesivir. Second, such a simulated two-arm study design enables us to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir with clear primary endpoints including death and discharge rather than only based on the clinical improvement before and after the use of remdesivir defined by live discharge from hospital, a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline on the supplementary oxygen use, or both as used in the original article. 7 Third, the results from such a simulated two-arm controlled study are supposed to be closer to those using a real two-arm randomized controlled trial in the near future in terms of intentionto-treat analysis principle. Such a simulated two-arm controlled study may also account for why the efficacy of reducing death and accelerating discharge in the current two-arm controlled study was approximately one-third whereas the efficacy of clinical improvement reported in the original one-arm study without the control group and intention-to-treat principle was two-thirds.",
