            "text": "Nanotechnology can be defined as the design, characterization, and fabrication of engineered nanostructures or nanodevices with at least one dimension less than 100 nm (Biswas et al. 2012; Abu-Salah et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2016). A reduction in the overall size of a structure to the nanometer scale results in a substantial change in its properties, e.g., chemical, physical, thermal, mechanical, which may differ entirely from their macroscale equivalents. These nanoparticles possess a high surface-to-volume ratio providing higher binding site density for the adsorption of various biomolecules (Arruebo et al. 2009). Nanoparticles conjugated with antibodies or other biological moieties (e.g., low molecular weight ligands, peptides, proteins, DNA, plasmids) provide highly specific and selective recognition characteristics. One of the distinguished features of nanoparticles is the variation of their physical or chemical properties dependent on their size and shape. For example, by varying the size of metal nanoparticles their radiation and excitation wavelength can be tuned. This unique characteristic can be attributed to an optical phenomenon known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR occurs due to the interaction of the incident light with the surface electrons present in the conduction band (Petryayeva and Krull 2011). The phenomenon is generated by entrapped light waves in the conductive metal nanoparticles. Hence, nanoparticles offer specific physical and chemical properties that enable their utilization in a variety of domains like biomedical, energy and environment, manufacturing.",

Natural nanomaterials are formed through natural processes and are governed by natural laws. Incidental nanomaterials are the by-products of industries (e.g., coal dust, particulates). Engineered nanomaterials are complex in shape and require specific processes for their fabrication. Based on the number of dimensions of the features, these nanomaterials can be classified into four types: 0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D (Chopra et al. 2007; Ciesielski et al. 2010; Pashchanka et al. 2010; Song et al. 2010). Zero-dimensional nanostructured materials have nanoscale dimensions in all directions, e.g., nanoparticles, nanospheres, quantum dots. One-dimensional nanostructures have non-nanoscale dimensions in a single direction such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanobelts, nanoribbons, nanostars (Kumar et al. 2017). Two-dimensional nanostructures possess two dimensions having non-nanometric size range, e.g., graphene nanosheets, nanoplates, nanobelts, nanodiscs. Three-dimensional nanostructures contain non-nanoscale features in any three dimensions, e.g., nanotetrapods, nanoflowers, nanocombs.",

It maintains a condition of overall neutrality, although there may be a net positive or negative charge on certain particles. Plasma arcing method requires an ionized state of gas atoms, for which high energy is necessary to peel off the electron from its valence shell to obtain a positively charged atom. An electrical arrangement consisting of an anode and cathode is developed providing sufficient amount of electric field to transform the atoms into ions. Electrodes used are usually made up of conducting materials or mixtures of conducting and non-conducting materials. Generation of contracted plasma uses inert gas as a heat source. Emission of electrons takes place from one electrode due to the presence of high potential difference causing an electrical breakdown. A sudden avalanche of electrons results in the formation of an arc in the zone between the electrodes. Positively charged ions travel at a high velocity and are driven by the applied bias voltage toward the cathode and get deposited as nanoparticles. It is ensured that the depth of deposition consists of a few layers of atoms with each particle of the order of more than 1 nm and all particles so formed are mutually separated. The average temperature of the arc in cold plasmas is generally higher than 104 K.",

The process involves exposure of the substrate to one or more volatile precursors. These precursors decompose the substrate and react with it to produce the desired deposit. In the process, vaporized precursors are first adsorbed onto a substrate at a high temperature, which then react with one another or decompose and produce crystals. There are three main steps involved in the process: (i) Reactants are transported onto the growth surface by a boundary layer, (ii) chemical reactions take place on the growth surface, and (iii) by-products formed by the gas-phase reaction are removed from the growth surface. Homogeneous nucleation takes place in gas phase, whereas heterogeneous nucleation takes place in the substrate.",

            "text": "Molecular beam epitaxy is a physical evaporation process with no chemical reactions involved. The basic difference between MBE and other epitaxy systems is that the former does not involve any chemical reactions and is instead a simple physical evaporation process. This method works on the principle of vacuum evaporation where thermal molecular and atomic beams are directly impinged on a heated substrate under ultra-high vacuum conditions (Cho and Arthur 1975). The first major advantage of the MBE process is it being a comparatively low-temperature process as compared to vapor phase epitaxy. The low-temperature characteristic of this process enables it to reduce autodoping. The second advantage of MBE is that one can have precise control over the doping process. One can achieve a growth rate as low as 0.01 \u00b5m per minute up to a maximum of 0.3 \u00b5m per minute, allowing for ultra-precise control of layer growth. With the advent of VLSI technology, it is critical to reduce all dimensions to atomic levels and thus the thickness of the epitaxial layer may also reduce further in future.",

            "text": "In the solgel process, dispersed solid nanoparticles (sols with diameter of 1\u2013100 nm) are mixed in a homogeneous liquid medium and agglomerated to form a continuous three-dimensional network (gel) with pore diameter in the sub-micrometer domain in the liquid phase (Hench and West 1990). A sol is a liquid in which solid colloidal particles are dispersed, e.g., black inkjet ink (carbon black is dispersed in water), while a gel is a wet solid-like rigid network of interconnected nanostructures in a continuous liquid phase. Generally, there are three approaches that have been employed to fabricate solgel film: (i) gelation of a solution of solid colloidal particles, (ii) hydrolysis and polycondensation of alkoxides followed by hypercritical drying of gels, and (iii) hydrolysis and polycondensation of alkoxide followed by aging and drying under ambient conditions. Several steps are involved in the process like mixing (formation of suspended colloidal solution by mixing of nanoparticles in water), casting of sol, gelation (formation of three-dimensional network), aging (for increasing the life of cast objects immersed in liquid), drying (removal of liquid from the interconnected continuous pore network), dehydration or chemical stabilization (to improve stability), and densification (heating the solgel at higher temperatures to eliminate pores and enhance the density, e.g., densification of alkoxide gels carried out at a temperature of 1000 \u2103) (Hench and West 1990). The properties of solgels depend on important parameters such as pH, type of solvent, temperature, time, catalysts and agitation mechanisms.",

MSA is a process in which atoms or molecules assemble together in equilibrium conditions to form a stable and well-defined nanophase by non-covalent bonds (Whitesides et al. 1991). All natural materials (organic or inorganic) are processed through a self-assembly route; e.g., in a natural biological process, a DNA double helix is formed through self-assembly. This approach can be used as a basic structuring mechanism to fabricate complex nanostructures (Mijatovic et al. 2005). The molecular self-assembly process is highly capable of fabricating nanostructures in the range of 1\u2013100 nm. In order to create complex nanostructures using self-assembly process, critical parameters such as, the well-defined geometry and the specific interactions between the basic units requisite significant consideration (Rothemund 2005).",

Zinc oxide has been exploited for various applications like sensors (gas, bio, chemical, visible light, and ultraviolet), cosmetics, optical devices, optoelectronic devices, electrical devices, photochemical applications, solar cells, light-emitting displays, optical storages, drug delivery systems.

Polymers are generally categorized as natural or synthetic (Broz 2010). Natural polymers extracted from the Mother Nature are biodegradable and offer excellent biocompatibility. Silk, wool, proteins (Dutta et al. 2004) (e.g., collagen, gelatin), cellulose, and DNA are some examples of naturally occurring polymers. Due to their complex structures, modification of natural polymers is challenging. While synthetic polymers are fabricated using petroleum oils as the main constituent, there are mainly four types of synthetic polymers which include thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, and synthetic fibers (Peacock 2000). Examples of synthetic polymers include polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), nylon, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, Teflon.",

            "text": "The fabrication methods of polymer nanostructures can be divided into two groups, template-based synthesis and template-free synthesis. Template-based synthesis includes conventional hard-template method (Parthasarathy and Martin 1994; Martin 1995; Yin and Zheng 2012), soft-template method (Meng et al. 2007), and novel wire-template method (e.g., water soluble templates, reactive self-degraded wire templates, seeding wire templates, biological wire templates) (Liang et al. 2010). On the other hand, template-free synthesis includes self-assembly method (Wan 2008), electrospinning (Li and Xia 2004), and nanoscale patterning. Template-based synthesis employs nanostructured matters as templates, over which one-dimensional polymer nanostructures can be grown. In a conventional hard-template method, micro-/nanoporous membrane materials, e.g., anodic aluminum oxide and particle track-etched membranes, are used as templates. The growth of polymer nanostructures takes place due to an electrochemical reaction of the loaded monomer solutions within the pores of these templates (Martin 1996). Reaction rate, reaction time, and temperature are vital parameters for controlling the growth of these nanostructures using conventional hard-template methods. In soft-template methods, soft amphiphilic materials like liquid crystals, surfactants, copolymers are utilized as templates. The formation of polymer nanostructures takes place as a result of the aggregation of self-assembled amphiphilic molecules through hydrogen bonding, hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic interactions and Van der Waals forces (Han and Foulger 2006). Novel wire-template methods are superior compared to hard-template and soft-template methods because they possess combined properties of both the above methods (Liang et al. 2010). The fabricated polymer nanostructures by this process possess high stability. In this process, preexisting one-dimensional nanomaterials are used as templates over which 1D polymer nanocomposites are grown. Template-free methods do not require any templates. Self-assembly is extensively used as a template-free chemical method for fabrication of nanostructures. Polymer nanostructures form by aggregation of nanoparticles through non-covalent bonding such as dipole\u2013dipole interaction, electrostatic interaction, Van der Waals forces, ion\u2013dipole interactions, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Electrospinning is also a template-free physical method, in which a very high electric field is applied between the syringe containing the polymeric fluid and a conductive collector screen. A liquid jet forms when the applied electric field surpasses the surface tension of the polymeric fluid and accelerates toward the counter electrode. During this movement, the liquids get solidified and accumulate as nanofibers over the collector. Several researchers have reported the fabrication of various polymer nanostructure morphologies. Epoxy-based SU-8 polymer nanostructures with tunable high aspect ratios have been fabricated using electron beam lithography (Beckwith et al. 2015). These nanostructures were synthesized on glass cover slips. Uniform arrays of SU-8 nanopillars and nanolines are shown in Fig. 4.\n",

It has an antiparallel double-stranded helical structure which enables its use in fabrication of nanostructures and nanodevices through a self-assembly process (Seeman 2010; Sun and Kiang 2005; Yan et al. 2003). The diameter of each strand of DNA is about 2 nm, and the helical pitch is about 3.5 nm. DNA is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine), a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. It has several specific characteristics that make it a preferable choice for fabrication of engineered biological nanostructures. First, DNA molecules segregate by self-assembly process so that complex structures can be fabricated with a nanometer resolution (Yan et al. 2003). Second, since the genetic information is encoded by chemical coding process, the intermolecular interaction of molecules can be easily programmed (Sun and Kiang 2005). Third, although double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is a flexible polymer, it acts as a rigid polymer below the 50 nm size (Feldkamp and Niemeyer 2006). Therefore, the nanostructures (<50 nm) made from dsDNA can be used as rigid nanomaterials. Fourth, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is very flexible in comparison with dsDNA. It can be twisted to about 180\u00b0 and is even capable of forming tight loops in the nanometer size. By combining the properties of dsDNA and ssDNA, complex artificial DNA nanocomposites can be fabricated. The rigidity and flexibility of these tailored nanomaterials can be controlled easily. Fifth, DNA has superior physicochemical stability as compared to proteins. The nanostructures fabricated by DNA exhibit features such as robustness and can be easily processed and synthesized.",

DNA molecules have been used to fabricate \u03bb-DNA duplex, helix ribbon, helix tube, and DNA lattice (Fig. 10) (Lee et al. 2014). A 4 \u00d7 4 lattice has been developed by four four-armed DNA-branched junctions. Due to the large cavity size, these lattices can serve as binding sites for other molecules. For self-assembly of protein arrays, developed nanogrids were used to template streptavidin. The atomic force micrograph (AFM) of the self-assembled protein array is shown in Fig. 11.

ZnO nanowires have been utilized in biosensing applications by immobilization of antibodies on its surface (Gupta et al. 2014a). Goat antisalmonella was used for the immobilization purpose. Owing to the high aspect ratio, the surface of ZnO nanowires provides larger binding sites for the antibodies. For biological applications, the nanomaterials are required to be hydrophilic in nature which can be achieved by modifying the surface of nanostructures with water soluble agents. In this regard, water soluble ZnO\u2013Au nanocomposites have been fabricated (Wang et al. 2007). These composites fulfill two purposes: ZnO provides the fluorescence, and gold nanoparticle delivers the high affinity toward the conjugation of organic molecules. The transmission electron micrograph of the developed nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 12.\n",

The advantages of using nanocantilevers as sensors over microsensors are that they provide higher sensitivity, are economic in terms of cost, require lower concentration of analytes (in \u00b5l), employ label-free detection, have a faster response, and consume lower power. Diagnosis of a variety of analytes for detection of various diseases on array of microcantilevers can be done on a single microcantilever chip leading to a higher throughput and efficiency. The surface functionalization over these cantilevers using bottom-up approaches enables sensing and detection of analytes with higher sensitivity. This methodology holds the future for high-sensitivity next-generation nanocantilever-based sensing for forthcoming point-of-care diagnostics. Single molecule detection will be the aim of researchers necessitating development of highly sensitive sensors. Gupta et al. fabricated an array of silicon nanocantilevers for detection of a single virus particle (Gupta et al. 2004). The nanocantilevers were fabricated on a p-type silicon on insulator wafer. The oxide layer was wet etched using buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF) up to a 30 nm depth. A hybrid technique comprised of photolithography and reactive ion etching was used to pattern the cantilever beam. The etching was ceased by growing an oxide layer by means of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. BHF was used to remove the oxide layer from the side to open the windows through which silicon wafer was exposed. Finally, the cantilever beams were released through vapor phase etching using xenon difluoride. Scanning electron micrograph of the nanocantilever loaded with vaccinia virus particle is shown in Fig. 16.\n",

Mechanical resonance on microcantilever-based DNA detection using gold nanoparticles has been reported (Su et al. 2003). A change in the mass of the microcantilever is induced by the DNA hybridization leading to the shift in resonance frequency of the microcantilever beam. This change is further measured. The hybridization is seen to occur through the binding of the gold nanoparticles on the microcantilever surface resulting in a chemical amplification as a result of nucleation of silver. The method reports the limit of detection of target DNA at a concentration of 0.05 nM.",

            "text": "Recently, researchers have reported the development of DNA machines (nanometer scale) that can diagnose a particular target antibody (Ranallo et al. 2015). A structural change of the DNA stems is observed when an antibody binds with the DNA nanomachines, which can also be sensed by external means or through naked eye. A light-emitting fluorophore and quencher are connected to the two single-stranded DNA stems (weak). The recognition elements capable of binding the target molecule are attached to the ends of the DNA stem. Peptides and oligonucleotides are the two most widely used recognition elements. When these elements (symbolized by the red hexagon in Fig. 19) bind to their specific target molecule, the DNA stem is broken in two parts. It separates the light-emitting fluorophore and quencher which then generate a light signal. DNA nanomachines are highly versatile and can be customized in such a way that many antibodies can be detected simultaneously with high sensitivity. Other benefits of using DNA nanomachines are that they are rapid, robust, and do not require any reagent chemicals.\n",

            "text": "The exponentially growing potential of nanostructures has envisaged several applications in the treatment of numerous medical ailments. ZnO nanoparticles have been used to augment the mechanical and antimicrobial properties of dental filler material (Gupta et al. 2015c). ZnO\u2013HAP nanocomposite was fabricated by mixing ZnO nanoparticles with hydroxyapatite (HAP) using a wet chemical route through ultrasonication process. The antimicrobial properties of this nanocomposite have been investigated for E. coli DH5\u03b1 and Streptococcus mutans, and a substantial enhancement in the antimicrobial activity has been reported. ZnO nanostructures have also been used for anticancer studies and their action against human brain tumor U87 and cervical cancer HeLa (Wahab et al. 2011). Under all effective concentrations, these nanostructures revealed reduced cytotoxicity against normal human HEK cells. ZnO nanoparticles have also shown a strong special capability to destroy cancerous T cells (Hanley et al. 2008). It has also been reported that ZnO nanostructures exhibit excellent ultraviolet blocking characteristics (Smijs and Pavel 2011; Kathirvelu et al. 2009). There are primarily three types of ultraviolet rays contained in natural sunlight, i.e., UV-A (320\u2013400 nm), UV-B (290\u2013320 nm), and UV-C (250\u2013290 nm) (Vaseem et al. 2010). Among all of them, UV-A and UV-B are more dangerous as they may cause skin cancer. In order to protect the human skin from direct exposure of these rays, a ZnO\u2013TiO2 (titanium dioxide) nanocomposite (Smijs and Pavel 2011) has been developed in which TiO2 blocks the UV-B rays while ZnO nanoparticles block the UV-A rays. ZnO nanoparticles have been coated on fabrics to make them UV resistant (Kathirvelu et al. 2009). Since the size of ZnO particles is in the nanometer range, it binds very well to the fabric owing to the Van der Waals force of attraction and the adhesion is retained even after multiple washings (Fig. 20).\n",

These nanofibers are highly efficient for degradation of pollutants under visible light. It has been observed that the nanofibers are very stable and exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than bulk PDPB. The organic pollutants such as methyl orange and phenol are highly toxic and are a threat to the ecosystem. These pollutants have been degraded by photocatalysis process. The nano-PDPB nanofibers possess good photocatalytic activity for methyl orange under visible light. A 75% degradation of methyl orange has been achieved after 240 min of irradiation.
