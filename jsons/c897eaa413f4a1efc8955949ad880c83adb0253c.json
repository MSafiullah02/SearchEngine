In an attempt to conserve 26 resources and slow the spread of disease the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 27 (CMS) [9] , the Surgeon General, and The American College of Surgeons (ACS) [10] 28 recommended against elective surgeries. As the allocation of resources became more difficult, 35 29 states placed moratoriums on elective procedures [11] . The moratorium on elective procedures 30 jeopardizes the financial integrity of healthcare systems that are disproportionately reliant on 31 elective procedures as a revenue source. In response, the United States Congress passed the 32 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), a $2.2 trillion bill with $100 33 billion designated to hospitals and $350 billion designated to small businesses including private 34 orthopaedic practices [12] [13] [14] . Although these relief programs may alleviate some of the 35 economic burden, the legislation is not comprehensive, and it will not resolve all financial losses 36 accrued by healthcare systems and orthopaedic practices. Without the revenue from elective 37 procedures, many orthopaedic practices have had to furlough employees and withhold surgeon 38 salaries [15, 16] . Mayo Clinic has announced a projected $900 million shortfall, with employee 39 pay adjustments and furloughs [17] . 40 41 New York City has dealt with one third of the COVID-19 cases in the United States and has 42 become the epicenter of the US COVID-19 outbreak. However, the number of new 43 hospitalizations in New York has begun to decrease, giving hope that the peak of the pandemic is 44 near. As we reach this critical point, it is crucial that we begin to plan for a return to a more 45 normal healthcare reality. Healthcare and orthopaedic surgery will be an important component of 46 the economic recovery. The healthcare sector in America represents 18% of the United States 47",

As orthopaedic surgeons we should help develop 48 sustainable institutional protocols allowing for the safe return of elective surgery and economic 49 profitability to healthcare institutions and orthopaedic practices. Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) 50 represents a large portion of orthopaedic revenue production due to high volume and high 51 margins. As we begin to make this transition, we need to understand that it will not be realistic 52 to conduct the same case volume as we were prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We should assess 53 patient demand for elective TJA operations following the pandemic. Economic recovery will 54 require a safe and comprehensive approach for the sustainable resumption of elective 55 orthopaedic practice. We must also critically assess the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis 56 so that we may adjust institutional protocols in a manner enabling an efficient response to future 57 pandemics.

            "text": "COVID-19 Crisis of 2020 and The Great Recession of 2008 60 61 The immediate economic effects and fallout as a result of the COVID-19 crisis resemble that of 62 the Great Recession of 2008. A 2009 American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons 63 (AAHKS) sponsored survey with 953 respondents evaluated the effects of the recession on 64 surgical and patient volume, practice type, hospital relationships, cost control mechanisms, 65 Medicare reimbursement, attitudes toward healthcare reform and retirement. The report found 66 that surgeons lost almost 30% of their retirement savings during the economic downturn of 2008, 67 surgeons planned to retire at an older age, and surgical and patient volume decreased by 30.4% 68 and 29.3%, respectively[19]. It is certain that in the short term, the COVID-19 crisis will have a 69 similar outcome as the Great Recession of 2008, temporarily slowing the demand for TJA. 70 71 The Great Recession further changed practice patterns as independent orthopaedic surgeons were 72 absorbed by large group-based practices or healthcare systems. The economic effects of COVID-73 19 may burden surgeons with debt caused by high overhead costs not offset by clinical revenue, 74 causing surgeons to seek more financially stable positions within large healthcare organizations. 75 Healthcare systems will further be impacted as the rate of patients with commercial insurance 76 coverage will decrease as the rate of unemployment increases. After the Great Recession, from 77 2009 to 2011, the decrease in inpatient admissions from patients with commercial insurance 78 resulted in an average loss of $3.7 million for a 300 bed hospital[20]. At the end of the COVID-79 19 crisis, unemployment is projected to be up to three times that of the Great Recession. The loss 80 of revenue due to the lack of commercial insurance after the COVID-19 crisis will far exceed 81 that felt during the Great Recession. A rapid reversal in the economy is possible, however, much 82 of this depends on how long state and federal restrictions are enforced, and how soon effective 83 testing is implemented[6]. Many financially troubled hospitals and healthcare systems may need 84 to be absorbed by financially healthier systems further decreasing patient, payor and surgeon 85 choice and thus narrowing the healthcare market further and continuing the consolidation which 86 began in 2008. 87 88 Resuming Elective Orthopaedic Practice: An Evolving Strategy from Surge to Sustainability 89 90",

            "text": "orthopaedic practices to patients pertaining to any non-covered costs must 151 be complete, as patients may not have the financial capacity to cover these additional costs. For 152 Medicare patients, it will be necessary to identify any early discharge penalties that could create 153 an unneeded financial burden for the patient or practice[23]. Eliminating the increased out of 154 pocket expenditures for Medicare patients would be a helpful measure to assist in expediting the 155 safe care of our elderly, high risk patients. Extending HOPD and ASC hours of operation and 156 potentially operating on weekends presents another opportunity for orthopaedic practices to meet 157 the increased need for outpatient and early discharge TJA. Large private orthopaedic groups or 158 healthcare systems invested in HOPD and ASCs will profit from the increased case load, while 159 those who do not have access to ASC, HOPD or rapid recovery TJA programs may see be asked to consider eliminating the hospital-based reimbursement penalties 163 associated with the Two Midnight Rule. Hospitals should discharge patients as quickly as164 possible to avoid inpatient stays and should not face reimbursement penalties for efficiently 165 caring for the Medicare beneficiaries. Surgeons should be allowed to choose the appropriate 166 setting for their patients based on comorbidity burden to ensure that patients are cared for in the 167 right setting. Reimbursement should not be a consideration that slows down the discharge 168 process. It is time to evolve to a one 90-day payment each for Diagnosis Related Groups 469 169 and 470 to allow for the safest and most cost-effective care of TJA recipients. 170 171 IV. Technology and Innovation Investment 172 Perhaps one of the biggest benefits of the COVID-19 crisis has been the robust implementation 173 of telemedicine and virtual visits. Surgeon concerns about reimbursement, privacy and billing 174 has been partially resolved as a result of the pandemic. Orthopaedic surgeon practices in 175 Massachusetts have already begun evaluating the safety and effectiveness of virtual visits during 176 the 90-day global period[24]. During the COVID-19 crisis, it is not a requirement for practices to 177 use HIPPA compliant technology options, however, it is likely that in the future when 178 telemedicine is used for routine post-operative visits, the use of HIPPA compliant technology 179 will be necessary. The planning and implementation of telemedicine platforms will be expensive 180 and depends on a number of factors such as: education and training, number of providers and 181 patients, compatible devices and security costs and concerns. Traditional capital expenditure 182 purchase models for telemedicine platforms start at about $42,000, however, newer more 183 affordable options include per physician fees that start at around $799 per month [25]. It is 184 evident that the days of routine postoperative visits are fading and will be replaced with 185 telemedicine. Virtual visits provide the orthopaedic surgeon with an opportunity to increase 186 office efficacy and cost-effectiveness in an era of decreasing reimbursements and increasing time 187 constraints. New patient screening and long term post-operative surveillance of TJA patients are 188 also good applications for telemedicine and virtual visits. 189 190 Orthopaedic groups and healthcare systems should look to technology and innovation during this 191 transitional period to help sustain high-quality care in a cost-effective manner. It may also be a 192 time when consolidating staff means that both surgeons, physician extenders, technicians, and 193 nurses learn more skills to help each other distribute the workload as we return to the procedures are reinstated, we must become more cost conscious and re-examine the 198 major cost drivers. It is well-documented that implant cost is the main driver of inpatient costs 199 for TJA[26]. The renegotiation of contracts with vendors to decrease implant costs may help 200 reduce the expenses for TJA. The use of specialized hospital physician negotiating committees 201 may increase bargaining power and drive down costs [27]. Orthopaedic practices and healthcare 202 systems should also assess the possibility of renegotiating terms on office space and imaging 203 equipment (e.g. MRI, CT) with the aim of reducing overhead expenditures. Landlords and 204 bankers may be willing to write-off short term losses in the hope of retaining a long-term client. 205 Value added technologies which drive up TJA costs need to be reconsidered or renegotiated. 206 Robotics, navigation systems, custom implants, radiofrequency sealant devices, and other non-207 essential parts of arthroplasty care can be eliminated in this time of economic hardship in order 208 to minimize hospital cost. Reducing the fixed costs associated with TJA will improve financial 209 performance and mitigate the losses associated with the COVID-19 crisis as demonstrated practices are eligible for several funding programs through the United States 214 Small Business Administration (US-SBA) established by the CARES Act[14]. These programs 215were created to help small businesses with less than 500 employees navigate during the COVID-216 19 crisis. The loans, which can be as large as $10 million are guaranteed by the US-SBA and 217 may be eligible for forgiveness if used for payroll and employee retention. It is essential that 218 orthopaedic groups understand their financial options, enabling them to control overhead costs 219 while participating in government sponsored programs aimed at curbing the deleterious effects of 220 this crisis. Orthopaedic groups must continue to manage expenses and overhead to ensure that 221 they do not accumulate unsustainable debt.",
