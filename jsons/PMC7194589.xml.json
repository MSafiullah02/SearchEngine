ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs, pancreas and serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2[1]. After endocytosis of the virus complex, ACE2 expression is downregulated[2]. There are 2 implications of these interactions. Firstly, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into pancreatic islet cells may directly aggravate beta cell injury[3]. Secondly, downregulation of ACE2 after viral entry can lead to unopposed angiotensin II, which may impede insulin secretion[4]. These 2 factors might have contributed to the acute worsening of pancreatic beta cell function and precipitated DKA in this patient.",
