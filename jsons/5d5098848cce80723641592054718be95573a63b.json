In response to the present crisis, understanding the molecular basis of comorbidity is essential to accelerate the development of potential drugs. To address this, we have measured the genetic association between COVID19 and various lung disorders and observed a remarkable resemblance. 141 lung disorders directly or indirectly linked to COVID19 result in a high-density disease-disease association network that shows a small-world property. The clustering of many lung diseases with COVID19 demonstrates a greater complexity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results show that the functional protein-protein interaction modules involved RNA and protein metabolism, substantially hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, are connected to several lung disorders. Therefore we recommend targeting the components of these modules to inhibit the viral growth and improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity.",

To construct the disease-gene association map, we screened the diseases which are associated with proteins (nodes) in STN. A disease and node are then connected if the node is associated with the disorder in the lungs. We observed, 618 gene/proteins, consisting of 36 SARS-CoV-2 targets, are linked to a total of 146 disorders, which includes COVID19 (supplementary table 3 ). Figure. Similarly, a disorder in the LDGN is also connected to multiple genes. For instance, ventricular septal defect (k =142), respiratory insufficiency (k =133), congestive heart failure (k =95), apnea (k =63) and hypothyroidism (k =60) ( Fig. 2b and Fig S1) . The disease-gene association pattern in LDGN indicates the molecular connection of COVID19 with a wide range of lung disorders. To comprehend the association between COVID19 and lung diseases, a disease-disease association network (DDAN) was constructed, where two diseases were linked if they share one associated gene (Fig 2d) . DDAN consists of a total of 141 diseases (nodes) and 1326 links, indicating a higher clustering between diseases. We observed 49 diseases (red nodes) in DDAN, which are directly connected to COVID19 (yellow node) (Fig. 3d) . Jaccard similarity coefficient was computed based on the number of common genes to identify the extent of molecular overlapping between lung diseases and COVID19. There are several diseases, like respiratory insufficiency, congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, and hyperthyroidism, which are closely associated with COVID19 ( Fig. S2a and b) . Thus patients having these disorders probably are more vulnerable for COVID19 symptoms or vice versa because of overlapping molecular connections. We observed that the degree distribution of DDAN does not follow the scale-free property (Fig.2e) A network is said to be a small-world network if S>1 [13] . Hence the topology of DDAN represents a small-world property, indicating any two diseases in DDAN have a high tendency to be interconnected and resulting in the overlapping pathogenesis between the diseases in DDAN. The molecular similarities between these lung disorders create a highdensity comorbidity cluster and contribute to higher mortality in COVID19 patients.",

[20] predicted the manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in different human tissues could cause various disorders. Therefore not only lung-related disorders but comorbidity in various organs can also be a potential threat for COVID19 patients. To strengthen this observation, the pattern of coexpression of genes in functional modules was analyzed. Genes in the same functional module often show a high coexpression profile; therefore, we have calculated Pearson correlation coefficients of pairs of genes using gene expression data of healthy lung tissue from TCGA. The median value of the positive correlation between the genes in all modules is significantly higher (p-value< 0.0001) compared with the random gene set (Fig3, fourth column) . Therefore theses modules can be identified as coexpress modules that share core transcriptional programs in the lung, indicating that their perturbation can result in a similar disease phenotype.",

The largest connected component within the LDGN consists of 141 lung diseases and 610 genes, indicating many of the disorders share the common genotype. For example, SARS-CoV-2 targets, FBN1 (degree, k=15), FBLN5 (k =11), COMT (k =9) and neighbourhood nodes, OFD1 (k =19), DNAAF2 (k =16), DNAAF5 (k =16) are linked to multiple disorders(Fig. 2c).",

Our findings are in agreement with previous studies by Rahiminejad et al.[19], where authors observed good partitioning of the functional protein module using spinglass in eukaryotes. Out of 21 modules, the top four protein modules were selected based on the presence of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 targets (>20) and gene ontology semantic similarity score (>0.2) of biological processes(supplementary table 5). A large number of the viral targets were considered because those modules are largely hijacked and strongly perturbed upon infection compared to other functional modules in the network. The modules were named as modules 1, 2, 3, and 4, and each module contains 63, 50, 28, 23 SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, respectively (Fig3). The biological process and pathway enrichment analysis show that module1, one the largest module, is mostly enriched with RNA metabolism, including transcription, mRNA processing, transport, mRNA deadenylation, and surveillance.Presumably, biological processes linked to module1 are hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage of infection for the production of its RNA. Notably, the components of module1 are linked to 64 disorders, among which the highly connected are respiratory insufficiency, ventricular septal defect, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and neoplasm of the lung (Fig3a, 3rd column, supplementary table 6). It is worth noting that most of the diseases associated with module1are directly connected to COVID19(Fig.2d and Fig.S2). On the other hand, hijacking module2 can predominantly affect the protein degradation (ERAD pathway, HRD1 complex, regulation of protein catabolic process), transport, folding and stability (retrograde protein transport, regulation of protein stability, VCP-VIMP-DERL1-DERL2-HRD1-SEL1L complex, regulation of intracellular transport, regulation of vesicle-mediated transport, protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum). Module3 and module4 involve several processes, majorly cellular transport, localization, organization, and cell cycle. Modules 2, 3, and 4 are linked to a total of 79, 60, and 32 different disorders, respectively(supplementary table 6). Many clinical conditions such as ventricular septal defect, respiratory-related problems, neoplasm of the lung, apneas are associated with all modules, indicating a higher risk of the severe illness of patients on the onset of COVID19 infection. Besides, we found a wide spectrum of disorders of various classes such as neoplasm, neurological, and digestive",
