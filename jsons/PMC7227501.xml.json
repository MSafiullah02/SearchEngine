Now, these services are imperative in nearly all care. These services must be offered to older adults, who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, loneliness, social isolation, and subsequent depression. Services include video telehealth, which has a robust evidence base including among older adults.1 Internet interventions and mobile app interventions utilize a more automated approach than telehealth. In these interventions, the user views and interacts with preloaded content such as mindfulness practices, prompts to engage in behavior activation, guided imagery, and psychoeducation. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy produces large reductions in anxiety and depression among older adults.2 Apps are rarely tested with older adult samples, but apps hold promise if evidence-informed, such as the new COVID Coach app from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that contains mental health self-management tools to use during the present pandemic.",

To accommodate sensory impairment accompanying aging, older users may need to increase the font size, change the boldness of the font, and make other adjustments to the device settings. Furthermore, many older adults are less aware of available mental health apps. A multi-pronged approach is needed to address these barriers, as described in Table 1\n.",

Many older adults need more knowledge, education, and support to use these resources.
