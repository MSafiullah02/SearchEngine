Beyond these domains, COVID-19 poses a profound threat to our most basic human motivations, especially human connection. While the threat to human connection is nearly universal, the specific pathways by which COVID-19 impacts our mental health are likely variable across individuals. In this commentary, we argue that research on the mental health consequences of COVID-19 should be sensitive to the universally experienced insults to our basic human motivations while simultaneously honoring the nuanced variable nature of COVID-19's mental health determinants from a precision psychiatry perspective. To support this effort, we advance hypotheses on how personalized brain profiles interact with our core need for human connection in the context of COVID-19 to underlie some of the mental health consequences of the pandemic. The research community could benefit from considering these issues as we begin to study the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric well-being. Ultimately, developing a deeper understanding of how biological, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms vary across individuals and underlie the mental health consequences of COVID-19 could result in personally tailored interventions and precision insights.",

Second, humans are motivated to pursue safety, which is reflected by our preference for order, certainty, and comfort over unfamiliarity, inconsistency, and chaos.

In concert with the pervasive threat to human connection posed by COVID-19, these brain styles could be determinative of how individuals experience the pandemic from a mental health perspective. Here, we briefly describe three such brain styles and posit evidence-informed hypotheses on how each brain style might interact with deficits in human connection to underlie mental health challenges in the context of COVID-19. As outlined below, a confluence of literature suggests that these brain styles hinder human connection. We argue that COVID-19 could act as a catalyst that might exacerbate these human connection deficits via pathways that vary across brain styles. Given the relationship between human connection and mental health (Eisenberger, 2012) , these dynamics may have profound implications for the mental health consequences of COVID-19. It is not our objective to comprehensively discuss the full range of consequences that each brain style has on human connection and mental health. Rather, we attempt to highlight several hypotheses that could be empirically tested as researchers investigate the neural, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms involved in the mental health consequences of COVID-19, including how these dynamics vary across individuals.",

An overabundance of connectivity has been associated with rumination about internal concerns and worries about the future, whereas too little connectivity has been associated with an overgeneralized sense of self so that achieving an internal sense of control may be difficult (Williams, 2017) . In addition to affecting how individuals see and feel about themselves, rumination also has deleterious consequences for how individuals relate to others. For example, ruminators are perceived by others as having a number of undesirable qualities, including dependency and neediness, being perseverative on worries and negative events, aggressive, and ruminators are seen as generally less favorable by others. As a result, ruminators are less likely to receive emotional support from others, and more likely to experience social friction, especially during times when they are in need of support (Nolen-Hoeksema & Davis, 1999) .",

Specifically, a ruminative style could exacerbate an individual's perceived threat to their physical health. Some empirical evidence supports this hypothesis, as a ruminative thinking style has been associated with a tendency to focus on health concerns. For example, prior work has found that individuals with a ruminative thought style are more likely to incorporate health concerns into autobiographical memory, and this could exacerbate their sense of vulnerability to illness and health-related anxiety (Sansom-Daly et al., 2016) . Thus, individuals with a ruminative brain style could reasonably experience an increased need for social support while simultaneously encouraging social friction and negative perceptions from others as their ruminative tendencies become exacerbated by the health threats posed by COVID-19. Therefore, individuals with preexisting ruminative tendencies may be at particular risk of experiencing a deficit in human connection during COVID-19. Importantly, ruminative thought tendencies have been associated with deleterious mental health consequences, including depression, depressive affect, life satisfaction, and overall poor psychological health (Ysseldyk et al., 2007) , and exacerbation of a ruminative thought style could negatively impact mental health via decreased social connection in the context of COVID-19.",

Anhedonic states may be propagated by a \"vicious cycle,\" in which an underactive reward system dampens an individual's motivation to engage in activities that are usually experienced as pleasurable (Husain & Roiser, 2018) , as these efforts are not reinforced with a requisite sense of reward, including anticipatory reward.

As reviewed above, reduced exposure to rewarding stimuli seems to fuel a cycle of anticipatory reward deficits, diminished motivation for engaging in social interaction, and blunted reward (Dodell-Feder & Germine, 2018; Ruff & Fehr, 2014) . Thus, individuals who are already primed for blunted anticipatory reward, such as individuals with an anhedonic brain style, could experience an even greater degree of amotivation to connect with others. In further support of this hypothesis, chronic deprivation of social interaction is experienced as a stressor, and animal models suggest that consistent exposure to stress exacerbates reward deficits in the context of anhedonia, which is mediated by modifications in the brain's reward circuitry (Willner et al., 1992) . Due to the interplay among these neural and behavioral processes, individuals with an anhedonic brain style are at risk for social withdrawal. Thus, individuals with an anhedonic brain style may experience exacerbated threat to their core need for human connection during COVID-19. Exacerbation of anhedonia has deleterious consequences for mental health, as anhedonia has been associated with depression, suicide, and overall poorer quality of life (Winer et al., 2016) .",

Subsequent work highlights how this brain-mediated attentional bias towards threat emerges as a transdiagnostic trait that commonly appears among individuals with clinical anxiety of various types (Abramowitz & Blakey, 2020) . In addition to contributing to psychiatric dysfunction, threat dysregulation impacts our social relationships and connections with others, as individuals who experience an overactive threat response are more likely to withdraw from social relationships and connections (P\u00e9rez-Edgar et al., 2011) . The relationship between overactive threat appraisal, anchored in neural dysregulation, and social disconnection could be reinforced in a cyclical manner. That is, individuals who report high perceived social isolation are particularly attuned to social threats and rejection, which leads individuals to think and act more negatively towards others, thus fueling further social disconnection (Cacioppo et al., 2014) .",

We argue that this perspective is a useful way to conceptualize the mental health consequences of the pandemic as it captures the depth of COVID-19's threat to the human experience and generates hypotheses on the mental health implications of COVID-19 from a nuanced, precision psychiatry perspective. In advancing this commentary at this crucial juncture of the pandemic, we aim to inspire the development of research questions on the mental health implications of COVID-19. It is our hope that evidenceinformed hypotheses, including those that we offer in this article, will be tested empirically as researchers integrate research aims on COVID-19 into existing protocols and future studies.",
