We performed multivariable Cox models, Cox model with time-varying exposure and propensity score analysis (both inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM)) to estimate the association of corticosteroid use with the risk of in-hospital mortality among severe and critical cases. Results: Corticosteroids were administered in 531 (35.1%) severe and 159 (63.9%) critical patients. Compared to no corticosteroid use group, systemic corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality in both severe cases (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, p=0.023), and critical cases (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.08-3.98, p=0.028). In the time-varying Cox analysis that with time varying exposure, systemic corticosteroid use still showed no benefit in either population (for severe patients, HR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.72-4.64, p<0.001; for critical patients, HR=3.02, 95% CI: 1.59-5.73, p=0.001). Baseline characteristics were matched after IPTW and PSM analysis. For severe COVID-19 patients at admission, corticosteroid use was not associated with improved outcome in either the IPTW analysis. For critical COVID-19 patients at admission, results were consistent with former analysis that corticosteroid use did not reduce in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality for severe or critical cases. The routine use of systemic corticosteroids among severe and critical COVID-19 patients was not recommended.",

Baseline characteristics were well balanced after matching, but corticosteroid use was not associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality. Since patients in the corticosteroid group were unexposed before the initiation of treatment, the use of corticosteroids was also taken as a time-dependent variable to reduce immortality time bias. The results of time-dependent analysis still showed no benefit of the systemic corticosteroids, indicating that our results are robust. Particularly, after matching and using time-dependent analysis, we could observe that the K-M survival curves of corticosteroid use and no corticosteroid use group were close to each other during the first 7 days in both severe and critical cases. The cumulative mortality in first 7 days was similar in two groups, which indicated that the difference in overall mortality was more likely to be caused by the use of systemic corticosteroids, rather than the difference in baseline characteristics.",

Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the corticosteroid use group than in the no corticosteroid use group (log-rank test p<0.001). The 28-day in-hospital mortality was 20.6% (95% CI:16.5%-25.6%) in the corticosteroid use group while 3.7% (95% CI: 2.3%-6.0%) for no corticosteroid use.The results of univariate regression model were shown in Supplementary Table 1. In the multivariable Cox model, systemic corticosteroid use was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, p=0.023) (Table 3). In the multivariable Cox model with time-varying exposure, systemic corticosteroid use was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (HR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.72-4.64, p<0.001). After IPTW and PSM (baseline shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), the results showed tendency towards the association between systemic corticosteroid use and increased in-hospital mortality after both propensity score analysis (HR=1.43, 95% CI: 0.82-2.49, p=0.201 in IPTW; HR=1.55, 95% CI: 0.83-2.87, p=0.166 in PSM).
