Data from 2,740 calves, originating from 16 French farms and observed from birth until 30 d of age, were analyzed using models that took account of direct genetic, maternal genetic, and common environmental effects. Both direct and maternal genetic parameters were estimated for birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE), neonatal vitality (NV), survival at 30 d (Surv), and umbilical infection and diarrhea at different ages (0 to 5 d: Umb1 and Diar1; 6 to 20 d: Umb2 and Diar2; and 21 to 30 d: Umb3 and Diar3). The heritability values for direct and maternal genetic effects were, 0.026 (SE = 0.027) and 0.096 (SE = 0.042) for Surv, 0.280 (SE = 0.063) and 0.063 (SE = 0.038) for BW, 0.129 (SE = 0.041) and 0 for CE, 0.073 (SE = 0.035) and 0 for NV, 0.071 (SE = 0.038) and 0.017 (SE = 0.026) for Umb1, 0 and 0.082 (SE = 0.029) for Umb2, 0 and 0.044 (SE = 0.030) for Diar1, 0.016 (SE = 0.022) and 0.012 (SE = 0.026) for Diar2, and 0.016 (SE = 0.028) and 0 for Diar3, respectively.

In addition, for three traits (Surv, Diar1, and Umb2), maternal genetic effects clearly contributed more to health performance than direct genetic effects. Estimates of genetic correlation between traits varied markedly (from 0 to 1 in absolute values) depending on the traits in question, the age for a given trait, and the type (direct or maternal) of the genetic effects considered. These results suggest that not all health traits in Charolais cattle can be improved simultaneously, and breeders will therefore have to prioritize certain traits of interest in their breeding objectives. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential utility of collecting and integrating data on calf diseases, NV and survival in future beef cattle breeding programs. To ensure appropriate biological and genetic evaluations of calf health performance, it is important to accurately describe the phenotypes for diarrhea and umbilical infections (in terms of age ranges) and account for maternal genetic and common environmental effects that explain calf health performance traits.

The two most frequent diseases are diarrhea and respiratory disease (Sivula et al., 1996; USDA, 2010) . Umbilical infection is the third most common disease during the first few months of life, affecting between 1.3% (Svensson et al., 2003) and 29% of newborn dairy calves (Virtala et al., 1996) . As well as the costs of treating sick calves and the time this requires, the economic losses resulting from calf diseases may also include increased mortality (Sivula et al., 1996) , reduced weight gain (Virtala et al., 1996) or longevity (Britney et al., 1984) , and older age at first calving (Stanton et al., 2012) . Previous studies had demonstrated the genetic component of diseases affecting calves (Heringstad et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2011) . Genetic and genomic selection therefore represent a potential strategy to increase resistance to these diseases, but necessitate the collection of additional phenotypic data beyond what is included in most of the national databases used for genetic evaluation. In addition, little research has been dedicated to the health of beef calves when compared to studies on dairy (and particularly Holstein) calves. Because French breeders were interested in improving the viability of Charolais beef calves, 16 herds were recruited for the purposes of this study, during which records were kept on calf health performance between birth and 1 mo of age. These records included birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE) score, vigor of the calf at birth [hereinafter referred to as neonatal vitality (NV)], survival, and all health events occurring between birth and 1 mo of age. The aim of the study was to estimate the genetic parameters for all these traits in order to answer three key questions relative to the value and feasibility of genetic selection to ensure young calf health: 1) Is it feasible to select calf health traits directly? 2) What pathologies should be included in such a health breeding scheme? 3) Can we select health traits indirectly through selection that focuses more generally on the performance of the young calf (BW, CE or NV)?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 245, "text": "(Sivula et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 246, "end": 257, "text": "USDA, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 373, "end": 396, "text": "(Svensson et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 429, "end": 451, "text": "(Virtala et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 613, "end": 634, "text": "(Sivula et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 657, "end": 679, "text": "(Virtala et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 693, "end": 715, "text": "(Britney et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 749, "end": 771, "text": "(Stanton et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 859, "end": 884, "text": "(Heringstad et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 885, "end": 908, "text": "Henderson et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee was not required for this study because the data were obtained from existing national and breeders' databases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"text": "The herds included in this study were recruited from a network of 75 Charolais herds, mainly located in the regions of Burgundy and Vend\u00e9e.

For example, infection by Escherichia coli is seen within the first 5 d of life, rarely later. Infection by rotavirus, coronavirus, and other viruses is frequently observed in calves that are 5-15 d old. Cryptosporidiosis is seen in calves older than 5 d but most commonly during the second and third weeks of life, while coccidiosis only appears after 3 wk of age (Gillhuber et al., 2014) .

This type of statistical treatment of herd-year effects is incorrect from a theoretical point of view as it creates errors in the ranking of animals based on their estimated breeding values (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2003) . Because of this, the discrete nature of most of the traits under analysis was ignored, as a linear model can perform as well as, or better than, a threshold model when the amount of information per level of effect is low.

Multiple enteric pathogens are involved in the development of this disease and coinfection is frequently observed in diarrheic calves. Since the commercial availability of vaccines against Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus (Snodgrass et al., 1982; Crouch et al., 2000) , Cryptosporidium has emerged as the principal diarrheic agent in young calves (e.g., de Graaf et al., 1999) . This protozoan parasite is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, which is one of the major causes worldwide of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in both humans and livestock. Cattle have been considered to be the primary reservoir for oocysts of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum, which is one of two species of Cryptosporidium that have been reported as being responsible for most human infections (Ryan et al., 2014) . No drug therapy is yet available and the high resistance of oocysts to a range of environmental conditions and chemical treatments make cryptosporidiosis difficult to control (e.g., de Graaf et al., 1999) . In France, data suggest that C. parvum is the main infectious agent behind neonatal diarrhea in both beef and dairy calves (Naciri et al., 1999) .

Here, we found conflicting results depending on the type of effects (direct genetic, maternal genetic, or common environmental) and the age range affected by the diarrhea outbreak. Maternal common environmental effects for Surv or NV and Diar1 (and to a lesser extent Diar3) were clearly favorably associated, while maternal common environmental effects for Surv and NV appeared to be uncorrelated (Table 6 ). Instead, maternal genetic effects for Surv were unfavorably linked to those improving resistance in any of the three diarrhea traits (Table 5 ). In terms of direct genetic effects, correlation estimates demonstrated opposing trends depending on the age range for the diarrhea outbreak: the direct genetic potential for survival revealed a largely favorable genetic association with direct genetic resistance to Diar2, whereas it exhibited a strongly unfavorable association with direct genetic resistance to Diar3 (Table 5 ).

These initial results will need to be confirmed by future large-scale studies of beef calf health genetics.

In addition, breeding goals should consider health traits not only directly through the use of health phenotypes, but also indirectly by using correlated traits such as calf survival or NV. Last but not least, breeders must be aware of the potential for antagonistic genetic correlations between animal health and production traits. There is a current lack of large-scale studies in cattle-particularly beef cattle-in which precise estimates of genetic correlations between all performance traits can be determined. Such efforts will be necessary in the future in order to implement efficient breeding schemes which can improve both production and health traits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Effect of a difficult calving on the vigour of the calf, the onset of maternal behaviour, and some behavioural indicators of pain in the dam", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Barrier", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Ruelle", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Haskell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Dwyer", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Prev.
