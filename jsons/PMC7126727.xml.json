Modular concepts to build integrated microfluidic systems have been a long-standing concern and an active area of research [9], [10], [11], [12]. The advantage of a modular system is that each module can be designed and tested separately before integrating it into a larger system. Nevertheless, the main challenge in developing a modular microfluidic system is to ensure leak-free fluidic interconnections among individual components once the unit is assembled. Furthermore, the ability to build a customized multidimensional microfluidic system following a modular approach would be an advantageous platform to substantially enhance design flexibility, and improve the system performances of various bio-chemical processes.",

To replace the conventional chrome photomask, Glennon et al., for example, achieved direct printing of a lithographic mold by using laser toner as the fluidic structure [14]. Recently, modular architecture using fluidic breadboards and prefabricated microfluidic components have become popular [18], [19], [20]. These pre-fabricated components, which allow standardization and customization, appear to be an ideal solution for research scientists, and can be widely applied. However, breadboard applications limit system flexibility. Rhee and Burns recently developed a modular microfluidic assembly block (MAB) platform; using pre-fabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blocks [21]. This allowed non-expert users to assemble fully customizable microfluidic devices at the point of use within minutes. However, this approach required a driving force control unit to activate the system, an additional glue-like, UV curable adhesive, as well as a PDMS mixture to connect components.",

            "text": "\nTable 1\npresents the modular fluidic components used to integrate Lego\u00ae-like SFMs. The functional components consisted of finger-operated, electricity-free pumps, a one-way valve, vortex-type mixer, reservoir, and heating block (with the associated block names P, OWV, VM, R, and HB), and the straight tube (ST), T-type tube (TT-F, TT-M with F, and M denoting a male to female type of sealing face), cross tube (CT-F, CT-M), corner tube (CT), and height tube (HT) were categorized as auxiliary components and the corresponding model numbers were listed below each schematic, which demonstrated the mass production feasibility of Lego\u00ae-like SFMs in several sizes. All components in this study were made of PDMS with the related design and fabrication methods described below. Fig. 1\nshows a schematic of the fabrication process for vortex-type mixers. A two-piece assembled casting design allowed users to easily strip the outer mold down without damaging the product. We initially mixed the PDMS prepolymer and curing agent (10:1 w/w, Sylgard\u00ae 184 silicone elastomer, Dow Corning), poured the mixture into an aluminum mold, and the container was cured at 100 \u00b0C for 45 min to construct the configuration. The one-way valve (OWV) comprised three sections: chamber, reed, and base plate. The wet PDMS was coated on the base plate before assembly to function as an adhesive. During assembly, care had to be taken to ensure the appropriate attachment of the reed to one side of the chamber walls. For the inflow coming from the right, the left channel was blocked by the reed, configuring a no flow state from the right to left channel. On the other hand, when the flow came from the left side, the reed would be pushed, and thereby bent to the right, resulting in an open path for the fluid. Therefore, the flow was allowed to pass from the left to right channel. The pump was built with a featured hemispherical chamber to minimize dead space (with the dead-volume ratio down to 6%) and a thicker top diaphragm of the pump to enhance durability. The pump chamber was 11 mm in diameter for ergonomic efficiency, and the inlet and outlet diameters were both 0.8 mm. In the tests, the chamber was pressed down to expel the air inside the chamber. Since the OWV function could only move the internal fluid to the right side, the left side was thus blocked by OWV and not affected during the application of pressure [22]. Similarly, the vortex mixer consisted of three sections: a hemispherical chamber, two inlets and one outlet allowing the liquid passage. The inlets and outlet were located on the two sides and the bottom of the chamber. Those two streams from the inlets blended together along the coiled passage toward the center, and wound downwards to form a solid swirling vortex under high Reynolds Number conditions. The vortex agitation could further fold and stretch the fluids spirally to increase the interfacial area for mixing enhancement. In our previous studies, we have illustrated that the current vortex mixer needed only 0.1 s to attain mixing efficiency of 93% and maintained a good mixing performance during the period of 0.1\u20130.4 s for a one-shot event [23]. The heating block measured 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 10 mm, and the inner and outer capillary diameters were1.8 and 3.0 mm, respectively. The device maintained a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor for heating. The reservoir was made using the same casting method as that of the chamber part of the pump. The diameter of the fluidic channel was 500 \u03bcm, while the volume values of pump (P), vortex-type mixer (VM) and reservoir (R) were approximately 956, 22 and 271 \u03bcl, respectively. All auxiliary components were used to allow channel stretch, turn around, congregate, segregate, and up and down movement. For bio-chem applications, the minimal volume of samples that could be processed in the devices is around 20 \u03bcl.",

The inter-block gaps were eliminated to maximize the functionality of SFM devices. The diameters of the male- and female-type Lego\u00ae-like SFMs were 2.75 and 2.5 mm, respectively. This design can tightly seal the contact faces of the two linked SFMs in a state of higher compression, and thus minimize the possibility of forming gaps. The function tests demonstrated that the pass volume ratio of the male- and female-type Lego\u00ae-like SFMs was up to 99.8% based on the measurements of the inlet and outlet volumes of water with the back pressure held at least 0.35 atm. This design feature allowed non-expert users to rapidly devise and assemble the Lego\u00ae-like SFMs into a customizable microfluidic device in minutes. To perform the PCR procedures, we adapted the capillary convective PCR concept by Chou et al. with a capillary tube mounted on a heater at a constant temperature of 95 \u00b0C [24], [25]. In operations, this concept doesn\u2019t require complex microfluidic chip design, special tubing, or vessels. The constantly heated capillary base drove the lowest part of the sample fluids and raised them by convection while denaturing the template simultaneously. During the ascending of the sample, its temperature dropped because of the cooling effect from the surrounding air. As the sample reached the cool temperature zone near the top of the tube, it underwent annealing and extension, after which the DNA template descended and was heated again. Consequently, PCR cycles were achieved by natural convection.",

The vortex mixer was inserted between the reservoirs and the gold nanoparticles collection zone (pump). This connection array allowed the test fluids to flow through the mixer to set the mixing process in motion. To manipulate the finger-operated electricity-free pump, the mixed reagents were transferred to the gold nanoparticles collection zone (pump) to completing the swift synthesis of the gold nanoparticles experiment.

Again, the left and right components were the source pumps and reservoirs of the target DNA, and the corresponding reagent with the formed SFM was a sample loader for linking to a DNA application zone in sequence. This experimental setup was similar to the system used to synthesize the gold nanoparticles. The only difference was that it connected to an extra heating block (HB) at the end of the system. This study used a PTC thermistor in the HB as the heater to heat the bottom of the reaction tube. It achieves portability by using a lithium battery as its power source, and the cost of one PTC thermistor is merely US$0.10. In fact, PTC thermistors are thermally sensitive semiconductor resistors that exhibit an increase in resistance at a given temperature. Change in the resistance of a PTC thermistor can be effectuated either by a change in the ambient temperature, or internally, by self-heating resulting from current flowing through the device. A steady temperature for over 30 min can be maintained at the top surface of the heater after power is provided from the battery to the heater. To operate the finger-operated electricity-free pump, the mixed reagents were transferred to the DNA amplification zone for realization of the ccPCR experiments. Then, a medical syringe was used to suck up the sample from the glass capillary. The combined model is depicted in terms of the block names, as follows:",

The finger-operated electricity-free pump delivered the working liquids in operations without the use of additional power sources, such as costly syringe pumps or air compressors. Because of the concurrent actuation of the pumps, a strong swirling flow developed in the core of the mixer chamber, and achieved a high mixing performance in a one-shot event. The proposed Lego\u00ae-like SFM was therefore applied as a sample loader to amplify the nucleic acid through the ccPCR experiments. The AuNPs were synthesized from the rapid mixing and reactive processes of HAuCl4 and sodium citrate. The ccPCR results demonstrated that the DNA sequences in 30 min from HBV 122 bp at the DNA concentration of 105 copies/\u03bcl were successfully amplified. The TEM analysis and surface plasmon bands centered at \u03bb\n = 523 nm revealed the production of gold nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 7.31 \u00b1 2.34 nm, within 11 min. Compared to conventional microfluidic devices, the Lego\u00ae-like SFMs can be effortlessly swapped and integrated into a variety of modular devices for quick assembly and the replacement of certain components to realize a fully-portable, disposable fluidic system with great potential for diverse bio-chemical applications.",
