Genetic diversity increased with the spread of new genotypes among both of subtypes in last years. The second hypervariable region (HVR2), which carries the C-terminus of the G attachment glycoprotein, has a high degree of divergence and, thereby, it has been used as the main indicator for studies on RSV evolution [3,4]. To date, based on this region, 15 RSV-A and 29 RSV-B genotypes have been described [3,[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]].",

Moreover, it causes severe respiratory tract infection in adults, especially elderly, and immunosuppressed patients [13,14]. Symptomatic supportive care and Palivizumab are currently available options to RSV disease clinical management, which reduce the symptoms and severity, decreasing hospitalization rate but not mortality [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. Fortunately, RSV vaccines are progressing in phase III clinical trials and could be available in the coming years [19], being G protein suggested as a plausible target [20]. Therefore, ongoing global surveillance and characterization of circulating RSV strains are required for evidence-based vaccination policies. In Portugal, RSV cases have been detected since 2010 through the national influenza surveillance system (ISS), during the influenza season, from week 37 (September) to week 24 (June) of the next year.",

The remarkable number of tested samples (8212) during the 2017/18 season could be explained with the consciousness-raising of relevance of RSV disease among physicians. Therefore, from our point of view, the prevalence of this season (14.4%) might be the best representative in the country, being similar to findings from Senegal [33], Thailand [34], Spain [35] and different regions in India [36,37]. Nonetheless, a true comparison of RSV prevalence in different geographic areas is difficult to perform taking into account the differences in the study design and, even in our study, prevalence was wide-ranging according to the season.

Periodic shifts (1\u20133 years) in RSV subtype have been reported all over the world [40]. RSV-A subtype was significantly higher in children younger than 5 years and especially those aged below 6 months, which may be concerning since RSV-A infection has been associated with more severe bronchiolitis and higher disease severity scores [43,44]. However, discrepancies have been described [45], and indeed, specific substitutions may indicate the most virulent strains during a specific period of time better than the subtype [46]. RSV-B subtype was significantly higher in 15\u201344 years old and female patients. However, this fact could be explained due to the low number characterized cases through the sentinel ISS.",

NA1 genotype was detected from 2010 to 2012, and during the 2015/16 season. However, the fact that this genotype was not found between these two periods might be due to the sequencing bias. In Portugal, ON1 genotype was detected during the 2011/12 season for the first time [27], and since then, it has predominated in the country as reported worldwide [48,49]. Regarding RSV-B genetic diversity, all belonged to BA genotype, which has already been detected in at least 23 countries [50]. BA9 genotype has predominated in Portugal since 2010 [27,42] as in other countries [10,45,49,51], being detected alongside with BA10 genotype until 2015/16, when BA9 remained the only genotype detected onwards. Since 2001, new genotypes have been added over time by different authors following the proposed criteria by Venter et al. [5]. However, the addition of new sequences from different locations or more recent epidemics led to re-classify previous sequences into an existing genotype or even consolidate a new one [9,26,52,53]. In the present study, we considered that all RSV-A non-NA1 strains belonged to ON1 genotype since mostly of the identified clusters showed a bootstrap value <70% and had the 72-nc insertion characteristic from this variant. Therefore, a standardized criteria may play a key role to assign an adequate genotype and assure the comparability between different studies regardless the addition of new sequences.",

Strains from both of subtypes showed common changes, conserved N-glycosilation sites and subtitutions leading to loss or gain of these sites that had been previously reported [11,40,41,45,46,49,50,[54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]]. Within RSV-A strains, the number of substitutions among ON1 strains was higher compared with its NA1 counterparts. BA10 strains showed 100% homology in the HVR2 to reference strains from Thailand (KY328142,KY328145) and had the exclusive substitution E292 G, which has been observed in other studies [58,59]. Continual surveillance of amino acid changes as well as novel N-linked glycosylation sites should be performed since alterations in the antigenic characteristics of the viral surface glycoproteins may enable immune evasion leading to an evolutionary advantage [45,58]. In fact, the spread of BA genotype has been explained by the 60-nc duplication in the HVR2, which was associated with an increase of virus attachment and fitness [60].",
