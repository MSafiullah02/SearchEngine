Results: Among the 54 patients with several underlying hematological conditions who were positive for HMPV, we found 13 cases of HMPV pneumonias.

Hospital Saint Louis, Paris is a 650 bed teaching hospital that includes 350 beds dedicated to onco-hematology adult patients. The Poitiers teaching hospital has 1413 beds for both adults and children including 64 beds for onco-hematology. In both centers, RVs are screened in the nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in all hematological patients who present with acute respiratory tract symptoms. In Hospital Saint Louis, Paris, from October 2007 to October 2009 HMPV was detected using immunofluorescence testing (Argene, Verniolle, France). Since November 2009, the detection of HMPV is performed using 200 L of respiratory specimen using a molecular multiplex assay, RespiFinder \u00ae , (Pathofinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands), which enables the detection and differentiation of 14 RVs including the following: influenza viruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses, RSV; rhinovirus; human coronaviruses, adenovirus and HMPV [8] . In the Poitiers teaching hospital, during the study period, HMPV and other respiratory pathogens (Influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, RSV, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, adenovirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) were detected using multiplex or monoplex nucleic acid amplification [9] [10] [11] .",

Six patients were allogeneic HSCT recipients, with a median time of 4.3 months [1.8-5.8] after HSCT and two had previously experienced an autologous HSCT. Nine of the HMPV infections occurred during the winter (69%), one in spring, one in autumn and two in summer. The infection was considered to be community acquired in 10 patients and nosocomial in three. Eleven patients had HMPV as a single pathogen, and 2 patients had rhinovirus co-infection of the lung. No bacteria or fungus was found in the respiratory samples at the time of HMPV pneumonia diagnosis. Seven patients with HMPV pneumonia presented no URTID (54%). However, among the seven patients who did not present with URTI symptoms, a nasopharyngeal aspirate was available for five patients that were all positive for HMPV. Six patients presented with both URTID and pneumonia. All of the six patients who initially presented with URTID progressed to pneumonia with a mean interval of 4 days (range, 3-5 days). The most frequent symptoms were cough and dyspnea in all patients, fever in 11 (85%), and wheezing in 11 (85%). In 12 patients, a lung HRCT scan was performed at a mean time of 2.5 days after the onset of symptoms (range, 1-5 days). HRCT findings were mainly small blurred ill-defined centrilobular nodules, branching centrilobular nodules and ground glass opacities (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). Bilateral involvement was observed in all patients, predominantly in the lower lobes. Nine patients (69%) had lymphopenia (\u22640.6 cells/L), whereas 5 (38%) had neutropenia (<500 cells/L).

            "text": "The striking feature of our study is the good prognosis of our patients. In previous series that focused on HSCT recipients, mortality has been reported to be between 10 and 40% [4, 6] . In our series over a period of 4 years, including all consecutive hematological patients with a diagnosis of HMPV pneumonia, no patients died, even though 8/13 patients required oxygen and among them two needed intensive care. Our data are even more striking in that none of our patients had received any anti-viral treatment. There is little data to determine risk factors for mortality of HMPV pneumonia in hematological patients. When available individual data are analyzed, a number of deaths are not directly related to the virus: relapse of hematological disease, lung cancer, other severe infection, or, in a few cases, the patient's desire to limit care [4, 6] . Other factors are likely to be involved such as an underlying lung disease, especially bronchiolitis obliterans in the case of allogeneic HSCT recipients. The very early onset of HMPV pneumonia after transplantation is also a factor likely to impact mortality. Renaud et al. identified several risk factors for HMPV-related mortality in a population of HSCT recipients including the severity of the pneumonia, peripheral blood stem cell or cord blood as stem cell sources and the use of corticosteroids [6] .",

In summary, we showed that HMPV pneumonia can occur in hematological patients other than HSCT recipients with a suggestive radiological pattern. Although the majority of our patients had a severe respiratory infection requiring oxygen, the clinical outcome was good despite the absence of a specific antiviral treatment. Randomized studies are needed to determine the effect of any antiviral drug on HMPV pneumonia.",
