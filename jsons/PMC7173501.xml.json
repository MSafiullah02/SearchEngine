Westernization seems to be associated with an increased prevalence of allergic disorders (asthma, eczema, rhinitis); the mechanisms involved are still under investigation, but several lines of evidence exist for a deviation of the immune response away from Th1 (protective immunoglobulin IgG immunity and delayed hypersensitivity) toward Th2 (atopy with IgE production) by decreased bacterial contact. As in asthma, multiple genes are involved, many of these code for epithelial molecules concerned with innate immunity. Nasal polyposis also demonstrates a strong heritable component with a relative risk of 18 times the normal rate and 6 times the normal rate with an affected father and mother, respectively. There are a number of genes associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease\u2014e.g., leukotriene C4 synthase promoter region\u2014which vary among different populations. HLA-DQB1 is associated with allergic fungal sinusitis. The genetics of cystic fibrosis are discussed in Chapter 46; heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis are overrepresented in the chronic rhinosinusitis population. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is also genetic, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 20,000. Various structural ciliary defects have been described, but one common defect\u2014a lack of inducible nitric oxide synthase in nasal mucosa\u2014has recently been found.",

Allergic rhinitis occurs in atopic individuals who have the genetic predisposition to produce IgE antibody responses to allergens, which are innocuous to normal individuals. The allergens responsible are usually airborne, so-called aeroallergens, and consist of plant pollen, fungal spores, house dust mite and cockroach aeroallergens, and dander from domestic pets. Allergic rhinitis was formerly categorized as seasonal, perennial, and occupational; however, the recent World Health Organization ARIA guidelines suggest that intermittent and persistent are better divisions, because they are globally applicable and influence treatment.",

Viral invasion occurs at the point of infection usually in the posterior nasopharynx and results in transient vasoconstriction of the mucous membrane followed by vasodilatation and edema with mucus production. A leukocytic inflammatory infiltrate develops, followed by desquamation of mucous epithelial cells. Initially, a clear watery secretion is produced, but it is followed by epithelial desquamation with opacification of secretions, which does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection, which complicates only approximately 2% of colds. Resolution occurs in a few days in uncomplicated viral infections; however, allergic individuals have more colds of greater severity than no atopic individuals. Rhinovirus infections in asthmatic children exposed to allergens to which they are sensitized give an odds ratio of 20 for hospitalization with asthma.",

Leukotrienes cause bronchoconstriction, mucosal swelling, and excess mucus production, and sensitivity to their effects is high in aspirin sensitivity, probably because of increased numbers of specific receptors.

Better demonstration of the nasal and sinus anatomy is achieved with CT scans, as well as of the important ostiomeatal complex, the vital region where sinus drainage by mucociliary clearance occurs. Obstruction in this zone is very important in the generation of chronic sinus disease. The main aim of FESS is to restore adequate drainage for the frontal, maxillary, and ethmoidal sinuses (see Figure 32-4). When this fails, more radical sinus surgery may be needed, but complete investigation for underlying medical factors (e.g., immune deficiency) should be undertaken first.",
