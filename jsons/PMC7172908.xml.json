            "text": "Molecular trafficking of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a fundamental process that is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis (G\u00f6rlich and Mattaj, 1996, Imamoto et al., 1995). Disturbances in these highly sensitive regulatory processes may result in the disequilibrium of cellular and nuclear proteins and eventually cause diseases. Importin-\u03b1 proteins belong to the major nuclear transport factors in the cell shuttling various cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Goldfarb et al., 2004). Importin-\u03b1 proteins are acidophilic proteins that bind as adaptors to cargo proteins containing a basic stretch of mono- or bipartite NLS motifs. This importin-\u03b1/cargo complex forms a trimeric complex with the receptor protein importin-\u03b21, which finally translocates through the nuclear pore by the interaction of importin-\u03b21 with nucleoporins (Hu et al., 1996, Radu et al., 1995, Rexach and Blobel, 1995). In the nucleus, the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form of Ran binds to importin-\u03b21 and mediates the dissociation and release of the cargo protein into the nucleus (Lee et al., 2005, Matsuura and Stewart, 2005). After successful nuclear import, importin-\u03b1 binds to the recycling factor cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (CAS) that, in conjunction with RanGTP, transports the complex back into the cytoplasm where importin-\u03b1 is again available for the nuclear import of other cargo proteins (Kutay et al., 1997). Importin-\u03b1 proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution (Goldfarb et al., 2004). In eukaryotes, seven importin-\u03b1 isoforms were described, whereas the budding yeast encodes one importin-\u03b1, and flies and nematodes encode for three importin-\u03b1 isoforms. However, all of these organisms encode for only one importin-\u03b21 receptor protein. The specificity of importin-\u03b1 isoforms to cargo proteins is determined by the complexity and the three-dimensional context (Friedrich et al., 2006, Goldfarb et al., 2004, Sankhala et al., 2017). Moreover, importin-\u03b1 proteins play a key role in cellular differentiation by regulating the transport of transcription factors through lineage-specific expression profiles in cells (Yasuhara et al., 2007). However, little is known about the expression profiles of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in organs that could give important insights into molecular mechanisms in health and disease. There is accumulating evidence that under cellular stress, such as oxidative stress, heat shock, or ultraviolet irradiation, importin-\u03b1 proteins may accumulate in the nucleus and disrupt cellular homeostasis (Furuta et al., 2004, Kodiha et al., 2004, Yasuda et al., 2012). In the last decade, a growing amount of evidence suggests that importin-\u03b1 proteins are utilized by various viruses (e.g., influenza, Ebola, dengue, hepatitis C, and coronaviruses) to circumvent host defense mechanisms (Basler and Amarasinghe, 2009, Canton et al., 2018, Fraser et al., 2014, Frieman et al., 2007, Gabriel et al., 2011, Hudjetz and Gabriel, 2012, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Neufeldt et al., 2013, Pryor et al., 2007). Little evidence is available on their mode of action in specific organs under inflammatory conditions such as virus infections. In this study, we identified the anatomic expression profile of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in the mammalian lung and studied their transcriptional regulation and impact on influenza-virus-induced pneumonia using cell culture models, genome-wide transcription analyses, and transgenic mouse models.",

            "text": "In order to analyze the expression pattern of major importin-\u03b1 isoforms throughout the mammalian respiratory tract (RT), we anatomically dissected the human and murine RT into an upper part defined by respiratory cells of the nasal concha (URT) and a lower part defined by bronchi and alveoli (LRT). Importin-\u03b11, -\u03b13, and -\u03b15/7 isoforms (Kpna2, Kpna4, and Kpna1/6, respectively) were abundantly expressed in epithelial cells, glands, and macrophages of the human (Figure 1\nA) as well as the murine URT and LRT (Figure 1B). We then measured the relative mRNA expression levels of importin-\u03b1 isoforms along the mammalian RT. In the human URT and LRT, importin-\u03b13 was by far the most abundantly expressed isoform, with 4\u20135 times increased mRNA levels compared to importin-\u03b11. Average expression levels of other isoforms were similar to those of importin-\u03b11, except for importin-\u03b17, which was the second-most abundant isoform (Figure 1C). Similarly, importin-\u03b13 was also the highest-expressed isoform, followed by importin-\u03b17 in the murine URT and LRT. Laser-based microdissection of epithelial cells was used to ensure homogeneous cell populations (Figure 1D). We further confirmed the exclusive abundance of importin-\u03b13 in the murine lung, followed by importin-\u03b17 as the second-most abundant isoform also on the protein level, using whole-organ homogenates (Figures 1E and 1F). Notably, in immortalized cells (Figures S1A\u2013S1D) and unlike in primary cells, importin-\u03b11 is the most abundant isoform and is therefore used as a prognostic cancer marker (Christiansen and Dyrskj\u00f8t, 2013, Dahl et al., 2006, Kau et al., 2004). Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the role of importin-\u03b1 isoforms either in primary cells or in an in vivo animal model. We then determined the expression of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in various murine organs on the mRNA and protein levels and confirmed that the lung (Figure S1E) is unique in exhibiting exclusively high importin-\u03b13 levels, compared to other solid organs (Figures S1F\u2013S1K). Moreover, comparable distribution and expression levels of importin-\u03b1 isoforms within the human and murine RT suggest that the mouse model may be considered adequate to study the impact and mode-of-action of these cellular factors in health and disease. Next, we directly compared relative importin-\u03b1 amounts in laser-microdissected epithelial samples of the URT versus the LRT (Figures 1G\u20131K). For all importin-\u03b1 isoforms, mRNA levels were highest in the alveolar tissue (LRT (A), up to 6 times) followed by epithelial cells of the bronchi and bronchioles (LRT [bronchiolar epithelium, BE]). The lowest mRNA levels were detected in epithelial cells of the nasal concha (URT). Thus, importin-\u03b1 isoforms are expressed as a gradient in the RT with gradually increasing mRNA levels from the URT toward the LRT (Figure 1L). However, importin-\u03b13 is the most abundantly expressed importin-\u03b1 isoform in the mammalian RT, unlike in other solid organs.",

Herein, particularly importin-\u03b13 and its close relative, importin-\u03b14, were shown to act as one of the main isoforms that imports tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-activated p50/p65 heterodimers into the nucleus via direct interaction (Fagerlund et al., 2005). Since the mammalian lung most abundantly expresses the importin-\u03b13 isoform, we continued to dissect the physical and functional interaction between importin-\u03b13 and NF-\u03baB. We could confirm that purified human importin-\u03b13 protein directly interacts with NF-\u03baB p50 and p65 subunits as well as with its precursor p105 protein upon activation with TNF-\u03b1 unlike importin-\u03b11 that was used as a negative control (Figures 2A and 2B). Consistently, treatment of murine fibroblasts with TNF-\u03b1 most significantly increased NF-\u03baB levels in nuclear cell fractions along with importin-\u03b13 (Figure 2C). In order to confirm that importin-\u03b13 is required for the nuclear import of NF-\u03baB, we generated murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with a deleted importin-\u03b13 gene (\u03b13\u2212/\u2212). Nuclear fractionation analysis in TNF-\u03b1-treated \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 MEFs showed significantly reduced nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 compared to wild-type (WT) control (\u03b13+/+) MEFs (Figure 2D). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed that nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB p65 was also reduced in \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 MEFs compared to \u03b13+/+ MEFs (Figure 2E). Conversely, NF-\u03baB p65 accumulated in the cytoplasm of \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, albeit slightly, likely due to the degradation of inefficiently transported cargo proteins (Figure 2E). The extent of reduced nuclear localization of importin-\u03b13 was dependent on the method used, albeit the absence of importin-\u03b13 consistently impaired efficient nuclear localization of TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB subunit p65. These data clearly show that importin-\u03b13 acts as a nuclear translocator of TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB.",

            "text": "We further observed an increase in general importin-\u03b13 protein levels upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment in total cell lysates, including nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions of murine as well as primary airway epithelial cells (Figures 2F and 2G). These findings might suggest that importin-\u03b13 gene expression itself could also be affected by TNF-\u03b1 treatment. In order to understand how importin-\u03b13 gene transcription is regulated, we screened the promoter region of the importin-\u03b13 gene for the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites. We found that the promoter region of the importin-\u03b13 gene contains a binding site for NF-\u03baB, as shown by earlier chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (Raskatov et al., 2012) (Figure 2H). Consistently, using a reporter construct encoding for renilla luciferase under the control of the importin-\u03b13 promoter, we could show that importin-\u03b13 gene expression is differentially affected upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment in a cell-type- and dose-dependent manner (Figures 2I\u20132K). In clinically relevant primary human airway epithelial cells as well as in generated MEFs herein, importin-\u03b13 promoter activity was highest upon low-dose TNF-\u03b1 treatment, while high-dose TNF-\u03b1 treatment resulted in a reduction of importin-\u03b13 gene expression (Figures 2J and 2K). However, multi-passage cancerous A549 cells presented high resistance to TNF-\u03b1 treatment (Figure 2I), suggesting a delayed dose-response curve. Treating MEFs with other cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) did not significantly alter importin-\u03b13 promoter activity, unlike TNF-\u03b1 treatment (Figures S2A and S2B), albeit IL-10 presented a slight induction (Figure S2A). Next, we wanted to assess whether TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB is directly involved in regulating importin-\u03b13 gene transcription. Therefore, we used cells deficient in the NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the IKK (I\u03baB kinase), which is required for NF-\u03baB phosphorylation and thus its activation. Importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels were reduced in TNF-\u03b1-treated NEMO\u2212/\u2212 cells compared to untreated controls (Figure 2L). As expected, reduced importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels also resulted in reduced importin-\u03b13 protein expression in NEMO\u2212/\u2212 cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2M). Reduced importin-\u03b13 expression in NEMO\u2212/\u2212 cells could be restored upon transfection of a NEMO-expressing plasmid back into NEMO\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure 2M). Control treatment of NEMO\u2212/\u2212 cells with IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or TGF-\u03b2 showed similarly reduced importin-\u03b13 mRNA expression levels as upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment (Figure 2N). It is important to note that IL-6 transcription is directly dependent on NF-\u03baB, unlike IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 or TGF-\u03b2. These findings support the concept that TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB is crucial for importin-\u03b13 gene expression. However, other cytokines might also reduce importin-\u03b13 expression at high, but not low, cytokine concentrations (Figure S2C). Our findings support the concept that importin-\u03b13 gene expression is controlled by TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB in a cell- and dose-dependent manner. This is in line with general control mechanisms in cells, such as negative or positive feedback loops, where gene transcription is regulated (e.g., either by activating or blocking the promoter, respectively, depending on demand) (Figure 2O). However, other, not yet defined, NF-\u03baB-independent pathways might also affect importin-\u03b13 gene expression. Future studies are required to dissect the importin-\u03b13 promotor for transcription factor binding sites other than NF-\u03baB.",

            "text": "Since the NF-\u03baB transporting nuclear import factor importin-\u03b13 was the only isoform in the lung that altered its expression levels upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment, we wanted to know how importin-\u03b13 is regulated under respiratory stress associated with cellular cytokine changes. Therefore, we used an influenza infection model. We infected MEFs with highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) mutants that were known to act as low- or high-level TNF-\u03b1 inducers (Figure 3\nA). Then, we infected MEFs either with the low-level TNF-\u03b1-inducing HPAIV containing an avian-type polymerase signature (SC35-PB2701D), common in influenza A virus (IAV) having a low replicative fitness in mammals, or its high-level TNF-\u03b1-inducing HPAIV counterpart containing a human-type polymerase signature (SC35M-PB2701N), common in IAV possessing a high replicative fitness and virulence in mammalian species. Importin-\u03b13 protein levels were strongly reduced in human-type HPAIV compared to avian-type HPAIV-infected MEFs (Figures 3B\u20133E). In contrast, protein expression levels of other importin-\u03b1 isoforms (\u03b11, \u03b14, \u03b15, and \u03b17) were not affected (Figures 3F and 3G). Next, we wanted to assess whether replication of avian- and human-type HPAIV is affected in cells deficient in importin-\u03b13. Cells deficient in importin-\u03b13 were obtained from fibroblasts of mice generated for this study with a deleted importin-\u03b13 gene (\u03b13\u2212/\u2212; \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 MEFs; Figures S2D and S2E). MEFs with a deficient importin-\u03b17 gene were obtained from mice with a deleted importin-\u03b17 gene (\u03b17\u2212/\u2212), described previously (Gabriel et al., 2011). Replication kinetics in MEFs revealed that avian-type but not human-type HPAIV replication is impaired in cells with a deleted importin-\u03b13 gene (\u03b13\u2212/\u2212), unlike in control cells, with a deleted importin-\u03b17 gene (\u03b17\u2212/\u2212) that acts as a positive factor of human-type HPAIV replication in mammalian cells (Hudjetz and Gabriel, 2012) (Figures 3H and 3I). Interestingly, avian-type HPAIV replication in \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 MEFs is increased by >1,000 times compared to WT control cells. Human-type HPAIV replication was comparable between WT and \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figures 3J and 3K). In line, human-type SC35M-PB2701N HPAIV replication was not affected in human H1299 \u03b13+/+ cells upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment, likely due to the strong inhibition of importin-\u03b13 protein expression (Figure 3L). In human H1299 \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 cells, SC35M-PB2701N HPAIV replication slightly increased, suggesting some residual inhibitory activity of importin-\u03b13 in human cells (Figure 3L). These findings show that low-level TNF-\u03b1-inducing HPAIVs with avian-type polymerase signatures are highly sensitive to importin-\u03b13-mediated virus restriction. In contrast, high-level TNF-\u03b1-inducing HPAIVs with human-type polymerase genes are resistant to importin-\u03b13-mediated virus restriction.",

Among all importin-\u03b1 isoforms analyzed, importin-\u03b11 was the most diverse nuclear import factor, with amino acid homology of 83.52% between chicken and humans (Figure 4\nA; Table S1). The isoforms importin-\u03b13 and importin-\u03b14 displayed the highest amino acid homologies between chicken and humans of 99.04% and 98.08%, respectively (Figures 4B and 4C; Table S1). Importin-\u03b15, -\u03b16, and -\u03b17 presented amino acid homologies between chicken and humans of 95.91%, 94.22%, and 94.4%, respectively (Figures 4D\u20134F; Table S1). These findings suggest that particularly importin-\u03b13 and importin-\u03b14, both known nuclear transporters of NF-\u03baB (Fagerlund et al., 2005), are highly conserved across species kingdoms. However, importin-\u03b13 is expressed up to ~5-times-higher levels than importin-\u03b14 in the murine and human lung (Figures 1C and 1D), highlighting particularly the importance of importin-\u03b13 in respiratory immune responses. Thus, acquiring the ability to downregulate importin-\u03b13 in the lung might serve as an important basis in avian-mammalian virus transmission. In order to see whether differential importin-\u03b13 regulation is also present in human isolates, we analyzed human-type HPAIV strains that caused poultry outbreaks with human infections in the Netherlands (H7N7) or Thailand (H5N1). Infection of primary lung cultures with cytokine storm, including TNF-\u03b1-inducing H5N1 and H7N7 HPAIV isolates with human-type polymerase signatures (PB2627K; PB2701N), showed significantly reduced importin-\u03b13 expression levels compared to their counterparts with avian-type polymerase signatures (PB2627E; PB2701D) (Figures 4G and 4H). These findings highlight the crucial role of importin-\u03b13 as a respiratory factor conserved across animal kingdoms in HPAIV interspecies transmission.",

Therefore, we assessed importin-\u03b13 expression levels in lung samples of HPAIV-infected WT mice. Infection with avian-type SC35-PB2701D led to increased importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels in the lung compared to uninfected controls on day 3 post infection (p.i.) (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast, infection with human-type SC35M-PB2701N resulted in significantly reduced importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels (Figure 5C). Since the human-type SC35M HPAIV contains mainly two host adaptive signatures (PB2 701N and NP 319K), we analyzed recombinant viruses with these single mutations to dissect their individual impact on the dysregulation of importin-\u03b1 mRNA transcription. Herein, the PB2 D701N host adaptive mutation was predominantly responsible for reduced importin-\u03b13 transcription, while its effect was further enhanced when combined with the NP N319K host adaptive signature (Figures 5D\u20135F). Compared to all other importin-\u03b1 isoforms, importin-\u03b13 continuously showed the most prominent alterations. Interestingly, the most significant alterations in importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels were detected at 3 days p.i. compared to 1 day p.i. (Figures S2F\u2013S2K), consistent with the concept that accumulating cytokine levels through multiple replication kinetics is required for a profound cytokine-dependent repression of importin-\u03b13 transcription. Avian-type SC35-PB2701D virus replication, which caused an increase in importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels, was restricted to the respiratory tract (Figures S3A and S3B). In contrast, human-type SC35M-PB2701N viral replication led to a significant reduction of importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels in the lung, increased virus load in the lung, and systemic virus spread (Figure S3C). The recombinant viruses with the single or combined human-type PB2 701N and NP 319K signatures showed stepwise systemic spread along with their ability to reduce importin-\u03b13 mRNA levels in the lung (Figures S3D\u2013S3F). These findings further highlight that host adaptive signatures mediate impaired importin-\u03b13 transcription, resulting in high-level virus replication.",

Therefore, we infected \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice and their WT litter mates (\u03b13+/+) with avian- or human-type HPAIV. Lung transcriptomics of mice infected with human-type SC35M-PB2701N HPAIV in WT as well as in \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed a subset of substantially altered expression patterns in genes involved in innate immunity (Engels et al., 2017) (Figure 6\nA; Tables S2 and S3). Herein, genes controlled by an NF-\u03baB promoter were particularly prominent, with 34% of all analyzed genes (27 out of 79 hits) (Figure 6B). Moreover, literature analysis of the hits highlighted that especially genes involved in TNF pathways were of high abundance, supporting the in vitro findings (data not shown). TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels were increased in the lungs of human-type HPAIV-infected \u03b13+/+ mice when compared to lungs of avian-type HPAIV-infected animals (Figure 6C). As expected, TNF-\u03b1 protein expression, which is also regulated by NF-\u03baB, was reduced in \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with both avian- and human-type HPAIV (Figure 6D). We then assessed a subset of antiviral genes under an NF-\u03baB promoter that showed reduced expression in \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice, such as TNFSF-10, IFN-\u03b21, IRF-2, MX-1, IFN-\u03b3, EIF2AK2 (alias PKR), IRF-3, MAVS, and IFNA-14. While none of these genes showed significant alterations in PBS-treated control mice irrespective of the presence or absence of the importin-\u03b13 gene (Figure 6E), the transcription, most prominently of IRF-2 and MX-1 genes involved in major antiviral pathways, was most significantly reduced in SC35M-PB2701N HPAIV-infected \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to \u03b13+/+ mice (Figure 6F). Infection of \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice with both SC35-PB2701D and SC35M-PB2701N resulted in enhanced weight loss and lethality compared to \u03b13+/+ mice (Figures 6G, 6H, and S5). Virulence was significantly increased in human-type HPAIV-infected \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Table S4). These data show that importin-\u03b13 is required for the efficient expression of antiviral genes under the control of an NF-\u03baB promoter. Failure to induce these antiviral pathways leads to high HPAIV virulence in mice.",

Disruption of balanced transport pathways, caused under stress or inflammatory conditions, can cause serious diseases. In immortalized cancer cell lines, importin-\u03b11 expression levels are particularly high compared to non-cancerous cells, as shown here as well as in many other studies before. Here, we shed light on the anatomic distribution of importin-\u03b1 isoforms in the mammalian lung. We provide evidence of the highly abundant expression of importin-\u03b13 in the murine and human RT. Moreover, importin-\u03b1 isoforms are expressed as a gradient, with increasing concentrations from the URT to the LRT. Abundant and exclusive high-level expression of importin-\u03b13 was a hallmark of the lung, unlike in other solid organs assessed, such as the liver, spleen, and brain. Knowledge on the importin-\u03b1 expression pattern in the lung is important to understand the molecular basis of cellular homeostasis that might be dominated by importin-\u03b13-transported transcription factors.",

The high substrate specificity is reflected by only a few cargo proteins reported to be transported into the nucleus by importin-\u03b13. Importin-\u03b13 seems to exclusively serve as a transporter of p53, a transcription factor involved in many cancer pathways (Marchenko et al., 2010). Importin-\u03b13 is also a key factor in the transport of the NF-\u03baB subunits p50 and p65 into the nucleus along with importin-\u03b14, which is the closest relative of importin-\u03b13 (Fagerlund et al., 2005). Mutations in ARM3 of the importin-\u03b13 protein were shown to be crucial for p50 binding, while mutations in ARM 7 and 8 were shown to be required for p65 binding (Fagerlund et al., 2005). Based on the crystal structure of importin-\u03b13, it was further postulated that it might pose a \u201cfast track\u201d nuclear import pathway under certain circumstances, such as environmental stress (e.g., viral infections), where cellular amounts of importin-\u03b21 may be limited, requiring fast counteraction (Pumroy et al., 2015). This hypothesis is in line with our findings in this study suggesting that importin-\u03b13 serves as a defense mechanism against influenza by promoting the nuclear entry of NF-\u03baB, which controls the transcription of many antiviral genes.",

            "text": "We further show that importin-\u03b13 gene expression is highly dynamic under inflammatory conditions. We identified an NF-\u03baB binding site within the importin-\u03b13 promoter element and show that its transcription is dependent on TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB in a concentration-dependent manner. HPAIVs that induce low-level TNF-\u03b1 expression, such as those with avian-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627E and 701D), increase importin-\u03b13 mRNA expression presumably by NF-\u03baB induction. In contrast, high-level TNF-\u03b1 expression inducing HPAIV, such as those harboring human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K and 701N), significantly reduces importin-\u03b13 mRNA expression levels by a yet-unknown mechanism. One possibility would be that high numbers of NF-\u03baB proteins may block the promoter of the importin-\u03b13 gene and thereby its transcription. Other possible interferences could be with NF-\u03baB-activating complexes, such as NEMO or its repressor, I\u03baB\u03b1. Future studies are required to unravel the detailed mechanism underlying the failure of importin-\u03b13 promoter activation. Such diverse feedback loops are known in cellular processes, where gene transcription depends on demand. Herein, generating a bottleneck in importin-\u03b13 availability leads to failure in inducing an adequate antiviral immune response, as shown in mice lacking the importin-\u03b13 gene. Interestingly, more than 30% of the differentially expressed genes between \u03b13\u2212/\u2212 mice and their \u03b13+/+ litter mates were under the control of an NF-\u03baB promoter, highlighting the significant contribution of importin-\u03b13 in NF-\u03baB-mediated gene transcription. We could further show, using HPAIV strains of the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes that have caused pneumonia and death in humans, that downregulation of importin-\u03b13 mRNA transcription was a hallmark that was mediated by their human-type polymerase signatures. The introduction of avian-type polymerase signatures into the genetic backbone of these HPAIV outbreak strains restored importin-\u03b13 mRNA transcription in the lung. It is important to note that these human-type HPAIVs induce a general cytokine storm, including TNF-\u03b1. Thus, more detailed studies are required to understand the impact of other cytokines on the transcription level of importin-\u03b13. However, a pulmonary increase in TNF-\u03b1 levels with a concomitant increase in virulence has been described for many human H5N1 and H7N7 isolates containing human-type (PB2627K) signatures (Abdel-Ghafar et al., 2008, de Jong et al., 2006, Hatta et al., 2001, Peiris et al., 2007, Szretter et al., 2007). Based on these findings, we propose that human-type HPAIVs have evolved mechanisms within the mammalian host to evade antiviral response pathways by high-level induction of TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB, which blocks the transcription of importin-\u03b13, the major classical nuclear import protein expressed in the mammalian lung.",

            "text": "We have shown previously that influenza A viruses utilize differential importin-\u03b1 isoforms to ensure replicative fitness (Gabriel et al., 2011). Upon zoonotic transmission of HPAIV from birds to humans, they switch from importin-\u03b13 to importin-\u03b17 usage. While importin-\u03b13 acts as an inhibitor of influenza virus polymerase, importin-\u03b17 acts as a positive factor of influenza virus replication. Importin-\u03b17 is believed to act in a transport-independent function by a yet-unknown mechanism. Until now, it was unclear how importin-\u03b13 mediates antiviral activity. To unravel the mechanism underlying the importin-\u03b13-mediated inhibition, the generation of cell culture models as well as of a murine model with a deleted importin-\u03b13 gene was essential. Our previous observation that replication of HPAIVs with avian-type polymerases, unlike HPAIV with human-type polymerases, was restricted in cells silenced using importin-\u03b13 siRNA and is likely due to residual importin-\u03b13 expression sufficient to induce nuclear import of NF-\u03baB and thus the transcription of various antiviral genes. Furthermore, our findings here support the concept that avian influenza viruses evade importin-\u03b13 restriction by blocking its transcription. As a consequence, influenza viruses get access to the second-most abundant isoform in the lung, importin-\u03b17, to ensure high-replicative fitness in the human lung (Gabriel et al., 2011).",

After homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells, exon 1 bearing the translational start site for the importin-\u03b13 protein, was deleted. ES cells were electroporated with the linearized construct and clones were picked after double selection with neomycin and gancyclovir. Positive clones were identified by PCR and one of them was chosen for blastocyst injection. From the injected ES cell clone, germline chimeras were obtained and bred with C57BL/6 mice. Importin-\u03b13 deficient mice were backcrossed for eight generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background; the colony was maintained by breeding heterozygous mice. For genotyping, the following primers were used for PCR on genomic DNA of tail or ear biopsies: Impa3for 5\u2019-CCCTCAGTGTGAATTACTTCC-3\u2019; Impa3rev 5\u2019-GAGTCCAAAGCCACTTCGAG-3\u2019; Impa4neorev 5\u2019-GCCCAGTCATAGCCGAATAG-3\u2019.
