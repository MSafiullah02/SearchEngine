In regions that are preparing for but not yet in crisis mode, palliative care teams have an important role to play by facilitating systematic approaches to symptom management and patient/family communication with training specific to COVID-19 within their organizations. The authors of this paper \u2013 along with other educators across the country \u2013 have developed publicly available rapid-response education and tools specific to clinical scenarios facing health care professionals responding to COVID-19.",

The protocols account for care provided in all settings including oral, sublingual (SL), intravenous (IV), and subcutaneous (SQ) medication administration. Importantly, these tools are specific to COVID-19. They will be continuously updated as the global medical community learns more about the pathophysiology of the virus (for example, recent evidence suggesting that NSAIDs are contraindicated for patients with COVID-19)(8), as well as to account for potential drug shortages and common formulary restrictions.

Symptom and communication tools may be added to COVID-specific internal toolkits (e.g. on an intranet site or via email dissemination), and quick-reference materials may be printed and made available as pocket cards. These workforce training and technical assistance materials should be accompanied by guidance or criteria for allocation of the scarce resource that is the specialty-level palliative care team. Palliative care allocation should include clinical scenarios when it is appropriate to request a face-to-face ot telemedicine consult from the specialty palliative care team (including phone numbers and other relevant contact information).",
