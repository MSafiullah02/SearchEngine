The epitope recognized by mAb BT1-4F10 was localized to immunoglobulin light (lambda) chains; hence, the mAb recognized serum immunoglobulins and B lymphocytes. The BT1-4F10 epitope appeared to be restricted to Microchiropteran immunoglobulins and absent from Megachiropteran immunoglobulins. Analyses of sera and other E. fuscus fluids showed that most, if not all, secreted immunoglobulins utilized lambda light chains.

Despite hosting numerous viruses, bats do not usually exhibit disease, with the notable exception of rabies virus infection. The presence of persistent viral infections without pathology suggests a coadaption, thus, how viruses modulate bat-specific immune responses is an important question with respect to zoonotic disease transmission. Aside from their potential role as reservoirs, North American bats are also of interest because several species are threatened by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes the disease known as White Nose Syndrome (Lorch et al., 2011; Blehert et al., 2009; Chaturvedi et al., 2010; Field et al., 2015) .

Unfortunately, Microchiropteran immunity has been difficult to study for a number of reasons, including limited numbers of animals generally available for study, limited numbers of institutions with facilities for bat research, and, unlike for the mouse, there are no inbred bat strains. A major barrier to studying immune processes is the lack of specific immunological reagents and in vitro experimental models. For example, there are no cell lines of lymphoid origin, and there are few specific antibody reagents for detecting or characterizing bat cells or proteins.

The initial hybridoma screen was accomplished using flow cytometry to identify hybridomas that secreted mAbs reactive with E. fuscus splenocytes. Hence, all of the selected bat-reactive hybridomas bound to bat cells or to subpopulations of splenocytes (data not shown).

The epitope recognized on swine IgG was also found to be on the light chain, as reduction of the intact IgG showed only the Ig light chain in the both bat and swine samples (Fig. 3) . In contrast, a commercial polyclonal goat anti-bat Ig serum that had been raised against a mixture of chiropteran IgG that included E. fuscus IgG, exhibited substantially more cross-reactivity with Ig from different species. Indeed, of all the various types of Ig that were tested, only mouse and rat IgG were not bound by the polyclonal preparation (Table 1) .

We obtained sera from a number of different megabat and microbat species to use as a coating antigens in ELISAs.

The portions of the gels marked with rectangles represent areas of excision for mass spectrometry analyses. (B) Varying amounts of whole E. fuscus serum were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with mAb BT1-4F10. species, we generally observed a similar pattern of bands: high molecular weight proteins, some of which did not enter the polyacrylamide gel; a distinct doublet at approximately 150 kDa, likely IgG subclasses, and the Ig light chain (Fig. 4) . As would be expected, the putative IgG bands were the most prominent in all of the serum/heart samples. Based upon previous studies, it is likely that the higher molecular weight proteins are serum IgM/IgA, and possibly IgE. Similar patterns were observed in all of the bat species tested. Most of the bands appeared to be of the same size in the different species, except that the putative IgG of Red bats appeared to be of slightly higher molecular weight. We also observed that with greater sample concentrations or longer exposure times, additional lower molecular weight bands could be seen. The identity of these bands is unclear; they may be various forms of the different intact Ig molecules or multimers of the Light chain. Examination of a similar amount of mouse serum showed that free light chains, as well as additional proteins, were observed, although at much lower abundance than was observed in bat samples (Fig. 5A) . Further, the bands largely appeared to arise during the electrophoresis procedure, as passage of the samples through a 100 kDa membrane prior to electrophoresis showed that the lower molecular weight bands were largely retained in the high molecular weight fraction (Fig. 5B) . Mixing increasing amounts of bat serum with mouse serum did not result in the appearance of free mouse light chain, suggesting that bat serum did not contain a high amount of reducing agent that might break inter-chain disulfide bonds (data not shown). If the bat serum was first mixed with protein G-magnetic microbeads, the majority of the lower molecular weight material was in a form that was originally captured by protein G (Fig. 5C) . A similar pattern was observed when using protein A-magnetic microbeads (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that in some bat Ig, heavy and light chain pairing is achieved via noncovalent interactions. Given that mAb BT1-4F10 binds to a large proportion of B cells, we considered that the epitope might either be present on both kappa and lambda light chain classes, or that light chain usage was skewed to favor predominantly kappa or predominantly lambda expression. The ratio of kappa to lambda chain usage varies widely among different species from >90% kappa chain (e.g., mice) to >90% lambda chain (e.g., horse). To examine E. fuscus light chains, we mixed serum with Protein L e magnetic beads. Protein L binds to kappa chains in many, but not all, mammalian species (Nilson et al., 1992 ) (De Chateau et al., 1993 . We also examined protein L reactivity with mouse (predominantly kappa), horse (predominantly lambda), and swine (60% kappa).

However, as reports note, such studies face several challenges, not the least of which is a lack of suitable bat-specific reagents (Baker et al., 2013; Schountz, 2014) . Few, if any, commercially available Abs reactive with various species also cross-react with bats. Hence, we attempted to address this gap through the generation of monoclonal antibodies that can be used to identify important immune cells and proteins.

We found that, as compared to staining mouse cells, there was a larger amount of non-specific binding, which was somewhat reduced by pre-treatment of the cells with unlabeled rabbit IgG. It is likely that this binding occurs via Fc receptors (FcR). Because we also saw a higher amount of extrafollicular Ig staining by microscopy, we speculate that the overall levels of FcR may be higher in bats than mice. Others have noted that elevated FcR can occur with higher core body temperatures and that higher core body temperatures are associated with flight (Blatteis, 2003; O'Shea et al., 2014; van Bruggen et al., 1991) .

We show that this mAb recognizes an epitope on microbat Ig light chains. Based upon the lack of binding to Protein L, in E. fuscus, the lambda chain appears to be utilized by most, if not all Ig molecules. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that bat lambda chains do not bind to protein L (De Chateau et al., 1993) . We do note that genomic sequencing of the closely related M. lucifugus provided no evidence for the presence of genes encoding kappa light chains (Das et al., 2008) . We do observe that some E. fuscus light chain bind to Protein L; however, we also find that a similar low level of light chain is bound when assessing sera from M. lucifugus bats (unpublished observations). Hence, for both bat species, this bound material may be lambda light chains. In contrast, other reports, including a recent transcriptome analysis by Papenfuss et al. (Papenfuss et al., 2012) , show that other (megabat) bat species do utilize kappa chains. Bats and ungulates are members of the superorder Laurasiatheria. Most ungulates, other than pigs, have a strong preferential usage of lambda chains (Arun et al., 1996; Butler et al., 2006; Hood et al., 1967) . Because BT1-4F10 still binds to Ig after fixation (microscopy) or denaturation (western blotting), we suggest it binds to a of E. fuscus serum (expressed in ml) and swine IgG (expressed in mg) or (Lower) 0.03 ml of E. fuscus, BALB/c, or horse serum, as indicated, were fractionated using protein Lmagnetic microbeads. The unbound (l) and protein-L-binding (k) material was reduced and then resolved using SDS-PAGE, followed by visualization using silver stain. Boxed areas represent individual IgH and IgL chains. linear epitope. Much harsher treatment does alter the epitope, as staining is lost when whole tissues are embedded in paraffin and subjected to prolonged fixation (10% formalin overnight) for histology examination (unpublished observations). Among bats, the epitope bound by this mAb appears to be restricted to microbats. However, as we found a range of binding of mAb BT1-4F10 to Ig from different microbat species, it appears that there are some differences in the amino acid sequences which comprise the epitope. Other than an anomalous reactivity with the light chain from swine Ig, mAb BT1-4F10 is specific for Microchiropteran Ig. For a single epitope, the lack of cross-reactivity to Megachiropteran Ig may not be surprising and the degree of immunological difference between the two bat suborders has not yet been fully established. The commercial goat anti-bat Ig, which has been used to previously investigate megabat and microbat immunoglobulins, binds to Ig of both suborders. However, the strength of binding is much greater with the megabat antigens. Since the immunogen used to raise the commercial antisera contained E. fuscus IgG, among 11 different bat species, it is not clear whether the binding is due to cross-reactive Abs or due to a mixture of megabat-and microbat-specific Abs in the antisera. It should be noted that Wellehan et al. have produced a mAb reactive with megabat IgG by immunization of mice with Pteropus hypomelanus IgG (Wellehan et al., 2009) . By western blot analyses, that mAb bound to a number of different Pteropus species and had some cross-reactivity with the one microbat tested (Phyllostomus hastatus). Similarly, Omatsu et al., raised a polyclonal anti-IgG serum by immunization of rabbits with Rousettus aegyptiacus and showed substantial cross-reactivity, using an ELISA, with serum from a microchiropteran (an unidentified Philippine insectivorous) bat (Omatsu et al., 2003) .

In the present study, regardless of the microbat species, we were able to readily detect one prominent and one lesser Ig species with the expected molecular weights of IgG. While this could suggest the preferential usage of two IgG isotypes, it also may be that two or more subclasses were not resolved in our gel system. If the former is true, however, this may indicate that there is not as much practical functional difference between the two Microchiropteran species as the number of Ig classes would suggest. These putative IgG classes were not only found in serum but they were the main Ig we detected in saliva. Little IgG was found excreted in feces.

The major protein is unassociated light chain itself. Secreted light chains have been observed in other species, including humans (Dul et al., 1996; Shapiro et al., 1966) ; an increase in free lambda chains can be associated with pathologies, such as myeloma (Edelman and Gally, 1962) . However, most of our data is consistent with the release of light chains from intact immunoglobulins and the subsequent formation of light chain multimers and/or heavy/light chain dimers during the processing of the samples for SDS-PAGE. This, in turn, would suggest that in some portion of the intact Ig pool, there are no interchain disulfide bonds between the heavy and light chains. In their analysis of heavy chain genes in microbats, Butler et al. showed that bat IgA is similar to human IgA2 and IgA in cattle and swine in that all lack the CH1 Cys used in H-L disulfide bridging (pos 15) . The authors speculated that a different CH1 Cys (pos 77) was used instead to link the heavy and light chains, but left open the possibility for noncovalent associations. Although, cattle and swine appear to secrete only covalently linked IgA, human IgA2 can be secreted as a noncovalently linked molecule (Woof and Russell, 2011) . Based on our studies here, we speculate that some portion of secreted bat Ig, perhaps a fraction of IgA, also exists as a noncovalently associated molecule. However, we note that, in serum, the low molecular weight moieties were originally complexed to a protein G-binding Ig. As protein G in most species binds primarily or exclusively to IgG classes, our data might suggest that some IgG contains non-covalently associated H-L chains. However, we do note that in some species, IgA can bind to protein G (Peng et al., 1991) . Thus, the Ig isotype origin of the free light chain in bats remains unresolved. In addition to serum, proteins with a lower molecular weight than IgG were also identified in fecal samples, with the major protein being~45 kDa. This protein is likely not derived from IgG as we found little IgG in fecal samples at all. Thus, it is not surprising that the~45 kDa protein did not bind to either Protein G or Protein A. Other proteins were bound to protein G, however, they did not bind to protein A.

By flow cytometry, nearly 40% of the lymphocytes, chosen based upon forward and side light scatter properties, were B cells. This percentage was slightly lower than typical values (45e55%) obtained from mice (Pellegrini et al., 2007) and unpublished observations). For mice, B cell percentages differ in different strains and are influenced by factors such as age, antigen exposure, and inflammation (Pellegrini et al., 2007) . As our sampling of bats is still small and, because we examined wild-caught bats with unknown infection history, more studies are required to determine the full range of the B cell contribution to the lymphocyte pool. Still, we report a much lower percentage of Ig\u00fe cells than previously reported by Chakravarty and Sarkar (Chakravarty and Sarkar, 1994) . In their study, the authors found that two-thirds or more of Indian fruit bat splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes bound rabbit anti-IgM or anti-IgG. Whether the difference between these two studies is due to factors such as different bat suborders or species studied, infection history, FcR-binding, etc., is unclear at present. Aside from flow cytometry, we localized B cells in situ. While lymphocytes have been identified in the spleen using electron microscopy and in inflamed tissue sites by histochemistry (Sarkar and Chakravarty, 1991) , we believe that ours is the first demonstration of B cell organization in tissues using specific immunostaining. We have used mice for comparison in several of our experiments, although reports have shown that bats and mice are not closely related. This is reinforced by the disparate follicular staining in the spleen. In the mouse, the horseshoe-shaped follicles which wrap around the T cells areas stained relatively uniformly with an anti-kappa chain reagent. We did observe some more intense staining between the follicles which may be plasmablasts. Because nearly all of the mouse B cells express kappa chain (Hood et al., 1967) , this staining compares well with the lambda chain staining of bat B cells which are organized into round clusters scattered in the parenchyma. The darker staining within the follicles (brighter staining in the fluorescent images) was not observed in mice. It is tempting to speculate that these are germinal centers (GC).
