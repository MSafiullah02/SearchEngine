Indeed, when a group of 14 chimpanzees were noted to be suffering from colds and coryza, Morris and co-workers10 isolated a new virus originally named chimpanzee coryza agent (CCA).1 Subsequently, Chanock and co-workers11confirmed that the agent caused respiratory illness in humans when they obtained isolates from two children, one with laryngotracheobronchitis and the other with bronchopneumonia, that were indistinguishable from CCA. When specific neutralizing antibody to CCA was found to be present in most school-aged children, \u201cchimpanzee coryza agent\u201d was more appropriately renamed respiratory syncytial virus to denote its clinical and laboratory manifestations.",

Each gene encodes for a single protein, except for the M2 gene, which possesses two overlapping open reading frames that encode for two separate proteins (M2-1 and M2-2, the transcription processivity factor and a transcriptional regulatory protein, respectively). Four proteins\u2014N (nucleoprotein), P (phosphoprotein), L (polymerase), and M2-1\u2014are associated with the RNA-containing nucleocapsid complex. Associated with the envelope are three transmembrane surface proteins, F (fusion), G (attachment), and SH (proposed viroporin protein), that are important for viral infectivity.15 In addition, a truncated secreted form of G (Gs) is transcribed from a second start codon. The M (matrix) protein accumulates at the inner surface of the envelope and is important in viral morphogenesis. Two proteins, NS1 and NS2, are nonstructural proteins that inhibit cellular type I interferon activity and subsequently effect the adaptive immune response to RSV.12, 16\n",

In warmer climates, RSV activity may be more prolonged or even present throughout the year.24, 25, 27, 28, 29 What factors initiate and terminate the recurring patterns of RSV activity has been a subject of ongoing curiosity and investigation but remains a conundrum.29, 30, 31 A complex, and currently incompletely understood, interaction of local meteorologic conditions may explain part of the geographically variable epidemiologic patterns.32 Among these are the ambient temperature, humidity, and sunlight, and their effects on RSV's stability and infectivity. However, because the only source of RSV infection is an infected individual, human behavior is an indefinable factor integral to its transmission.29, 33\n",

Analyses of the proteins of strains collected over decades and from diverse areas suggest that the pressure of the population's immunity may result in a selective advantage for the dominance of strains that are most divergent from those that have recently circulated in the area. Evidence indicates that a recently emerged RSV B strain containing a unique 20-amino-acid duplication in the G protein has spread throughout the world and currently is the dominant variant among group B viruses, suggesting an evolutionary advantage over prior strains.39 However, the relationship of the circulating strain groups and subtypes to the clinical severity and manifestations of the RSV infections among young children has been inconsistent and thus inconclusive.35, 36, 38, 40, 41 The relationship between the substantial antigenic diversity of the G protein to reinfection with RSV has not been established.",

Inflammatory cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and consist of neutrophils as well as macrophages, mononuclear cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and eosinophils. Intubated infants with severe primary RSV infection have an early and robust neutrophilic infiltration into the airway, as determined by bronchoalveoloar lavage, and this correlated with a decline in viral load before the development of T-cell responses.86 The variability in the endowed innate defense and susceptibility of the host are also being increasingly correlated with polymorphisms in genes that are integral to various components of innate immunity.72, 87\n",

However, adults respond to the G protein with antibodies in both the IgG1 and the IgG2 subclasses, and the adult response to the F protein is predominantly IgG1. Antibodies after primary and recurrent infection usually decline substantially within months. Subsequent to natural infection, 75% of adults demonstrate a fourfold or greater drop in titer, returning to preinfection titers within 2 years in most.97 A protective role for local antibody in RSV infection has been suggested because animal studies indicate that circulating IgG does not prevent viral replication in the nasal passages.90, 98 RSV-specific IgA antibody, which is produced in nasal secretions during primary and subsequent infection, has been associated with protecting the upper respiratory tract from infection in adults and has been correlated with clearance of viral shedding in infants.88, 90, 99 Children with RSV infection may also produce transient specific IgE antibody responses in the respiratory tract. Levels in the nasal secretions of both RSV-specific IgE antibodies and of cysteinyl leukotrienes have been correlated with increased risk for more severe acute infection, with wheezing and with later episodes of recurrent wheezing.100, 101\n",

Hoarseness and laryngitis are not prominent features. A low-grade fever, lasting for 2 to 4 days, occurs in most young children early in the course of the illness. The height or duration of the fever does not correlate with the severity of the disease and is frequently absent in the presence of lower respiratory tract involvement and at the time of hospitalization. With progression of disease to the lower respiratory tract, the cough may become more prominent and productive, followed by an increased respiratory rate, dyspnea, and retractions of the intercostal muscles. With bronchiolitis, both expiratory and inspiratory obstruction may be evident. On auscultation, the infant may have crackles and wheezing. The rapid variability in the presence and intensity of these physical findings is characteristic of bronchio\u00adlitis, with marked transient swings in oxygen saturation often noted. Repeated observations of the infant, therefore, are required for adequate assessment of clinical severity.109\n",

The incidence of RSV hospitalization, found by using a regression model incorporating viral culture data from infants and hospital coding data from adults, has been estimated at 86 per 100,000, or 28% of the incidence of influenza hospitalizations.3 Using similar methods from the Netherlands to model data, RSV mortality was 64% of that attributable to influenza.9 Others have noted similar hospitalization and mortality rates in comparison to influenza.120, 121, 122\n",

A third group of 1388 adults hospitalized with acute cardiopulmonary conditions was also evaluated. During 4 years, RSV infection was identified in 3% to 7% of the elderly cohort, 4% to 10% of the high-risk cohort, and 10% of the hospitalized group. In comparison, influenza infection was identified among 4% of the individuals in the prospectively followed cohorts and among 11% of the hospitalized patients. Clinically, the illnesses from RSV and influenza were remarkably similar. Among the healthy elderly outpatients, those with RSV infection and those with influenza were ill for an average of 16 days. Of those with RSV infection, 39% were unable to perform their activities of daily living, only slightly less than with influenza. Among the hospitalized RSV patients, intensive care was required for 15%, and the mortality rate was 8%, compared with 12% and 7%, respectively, among influenza patients. RSV was identified in 5.4% of admissions for congestive heart failure, 11.4% of COPD exacerbations, and 10.6% of pneumonia diagnoses. Among the prospective cohorts, almost all RSV infections were symptomatic and frequently associated with appreciable functional impairment and use of health care services. The clinical illness caused by RSV in elderly persons is nonspecific and not readily distinguishable from other common respiratory viruses.118 Typical upper respiratory symptoms are more frequent than with influenza and precede lower respiratory symptoms by several days. Wheezing is more common with RSV infection, especially in patients with COPD, and chest radiographic findings are often minimal.",

In individual patients, RSV cannot be distinguished from other viral infections in this population. However, as in infants, wheezing is more common with RSV infection than influenza but similar to that caused by human metapneumovirus. Bacterial coinfection can occur during RSV infection, although the precise incidence is unknown. There are no controlled data on antiviral treatment for RSV in adults, and thus treatment is rarely considered except in immunocompromised patients (see later).",

Characteristically, the apnea occurs at the onset of the RSV infection and may be the initial sign before respiratory symptoms are noted.

The frequency of this long-term sequela in the general population is confounded by most studies having focused on children with more severe illness.170 Similarities between the immune responses after RSV infection and the responses observed with reactive airway disease have been offered as a possible explanation for the immunopathogenesis of the putative link between RSV bronchiolitis reactive airways in adolescence and adulthood.",

However, in a murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation and remodeling, previous RSV infection could induce airway abnormalities in mice exposed to allergen through the airway, even though these mice had not been previously sensitized to the allergens.171 This suggests that even without an atopic family background, RSV infection may provoke an allergic phenotype. In addition, RSV infection has been shown both in vitro and in children infected with RSV to produce an immunologic response similar to that observed with allergic sensitization, one with a predominantly Th2 T-cell profile and release of proinflammatory mediators, IgE, and neuropeptides70, 170, 172 (see \u201cImmunity and Pathogenesis of Disease\u201d). A similar response, however, may be produced by viruses other than RSV.170 The direct correlation between RSV lower respiratory tract disease and pulmonary sequelae likely remains elusive because the clinical syndrome of hyperreactive airways results from many different genetic, developmental, and environmental disorders.173\n",

Although ribavirin was safe and showed a trend of decreasing viral load during therapy, the number of subjects was too small to make firm conclusions.184 Inhaled ribavirin has been given either continuously (6 g over 18 hours) or intermittently (2 g over 2 to 3 hours three times per day). In a prospective randomized trial comparing these two dosing schedules in immunocompromised patients with RSV infection, the intermittent schedule appeared more effective in preventing development of lower respiratory disease.185\n",

A recent multicenter study of more than 6000 high-risk infants showed that infants receiving motavizumab, compared with those receiving palivizumab, had a 26% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization, and motavizumab was superior to palivizumab in reducing RSV-related outpatient visits for lower respiratory tract disease.202 However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel raised questions regarding motavizumab's safety (primarily allergic reactions), and it has not been approved for prophylaxis or treatment of RSV infection in high-risk infants currently.",

Also, concern still exists that an unpredictable abnormal immune-mediated response could occur in some vaccinees during their first RSV infection, such as was observed during the trials with the initial formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine.74 Furthermore, immunization would have to be initiated within the first weeks of life because most hospitalization for RSV occurs in the first several months of life.

This triggers the production and release of antiviral interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3) and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Two early nonstructural RSV gene products (NS1, NS2) antagonize interferon production. The chemokines recruit polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN cells), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A Th1-type cellular response becomes dominant under the influence of IFN-\u03b3 and interleukin-12 (IL-12), whereas under the influence of IL-4 and IL-13, the cellular response is skewed toward Th2, with the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophils.
