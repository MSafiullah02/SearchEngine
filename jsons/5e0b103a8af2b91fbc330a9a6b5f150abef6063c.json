Reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of respiratory specimens represents the gold standard for identifying patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as asymptomatic carriers. Its timely development allowed containment of the pandemic in many countries. Successful future management of the disease's spread will require the serological detection of past infection to determine immunity [3] . Especially in healthcare workers, this is of outmost importance to identify immune personnel that will treat vulnerable patient groups and for the planning and management of infection preventive measures. It also allows the identification of plasma donors for therapeutic interventions.",

Comparison of the kinetic of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer was done using the three semiquantitative ELISAs and sera of 2 COVID-19 patients of whom several consecutive sera were available. To allow comparison of the semiquantitative values between assays, the values were divided by the assay-specific cut off value for normalization. Normalized values of >=1 represented a positive test result. 4. Results 3.1. Determination of sensitivity and specificity 75 sera were included in this study, 25 of which were collected from patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result and 50 from patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result in respiratory specimens. The sera of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result were drawn on the day of PCR examination. The sera of the 31 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were collected 11.9 days (\u00b1 5.0 days) post onset of symptoms. Each serum was tested in parallel with four assays for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers: three ELISAs Euroimmun assay, 21 sera were classified as SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, 54 were classified as IgG negative. With the EDI assay 25 sera had a positive result, three an intermediate result, and 47 a negative result. The Mikrogen assay and the Viramed assay revealed 19 and 17 positive test results as well as 56 and 54 negative results, respectively.Applying the criteria described in Study design, 22 sera were considered SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive and 53 sera were regarded as IgG negative. All sera collected from patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR were SARS-CoV-2 IgG negative. 28 out of 50 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR exhibited a negative antibody test.",
