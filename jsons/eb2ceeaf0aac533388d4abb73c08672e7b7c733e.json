This family consists of a diverse group of animal viruses that possess a small, closed circular, single-stranded DNA genome that replicate through double-stranded intermediates. PCV has an ambisense circular genome [25] that encodes proteins by the encapsidated viral DNA, and by the minus genome strand of the replication intermediate synthesized in the host. The PCV virion is icosahedral,",

            "text": "In late 2005, sporadic cases of an acute onset disease of high mortality were observed in 10-to 16- week-old growing pigs among several swine herds of the United States. Tissues from the affected pigs in Kansas, Iowa, and North Carolina were examined, and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was detected consistently among these tissues. Phylogenetically, PCV2 can be divided into two major genotypic groups, PCV2-group 1 and PCV2-group 2. Whereas PCV2-group 1 isolates were detected in all the diseased animals, only two of the diseased animals harbored PCV2-group 2 isolates. This ob-servation is important because PCV2-group 1 isolates had never been reported in the United States before (GenBank as of May 16, 2006) , and they are closely related to the PCV2-group 1 isolates that have been described in Europe and Asia, previously. Our analysis revealed that each genotypic group contains a distinct stretch of nucleotide or amino acid sequence that may serve as a signature motif for PCV2-group 1 or PCV2-group 2 isolates. non-enveloped and 17 nm in diameter [25] . Two genotypes of PCV have been identified. PCV type 1 (PCV1) is non-pathogenic, while PCV type 2 (PCV2) has been implicated as the etiological agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine [1, 5, 11, 23] .",

Two coding regions of opposite polarity (by conventional nomenclature), the replication initiator protein (Rep) on the right and the capsid protein (Cap) on the left, are separated at the 5 0 -end by the origin of DNA replication (Ori) intergenic region (IR) of approximately 80 nucleotides [4] . The intra-type amino acid homology between the Reps of PCV1 and PCV2 is approximately 99.4 and 95.7%, respectively, while the intra-type amino acid homology between the capsid proteins of PCV1 and PCV2 is 94 and 90%, respectively [8] . Thus, the capsid genes exhibit more sequence divergence than the Rep genes. A third opening reading frame (ORF3) coding for an apoptosis-associated protein has also been reported for PCV2 and it is transcribed in the opposite orientation with respect to Rep [15] .",

To date, PCV2 has been detected in many parts of the world [22] . In past studies, phylogenetic analyses have shown that PCV2 isolates in various countries can be divided into to two main genotypic groups [6-9, 13, 17] . Recently, an extensive study showed that the two major groups of PCV2 can be further separated into multiple clades: PCV2-group 1 with 3 clades (1A, B and C) and PCV2-group 2 with 5 clades (2A-D and E) [20] . The genome length of group 1 viruses is 1767 nucleotides, while the genome length of group 2 viruses is 1768 nucleotides. However, PCV2 group designations have no apparent association with disease status or geographic area. Interestingly, it has been noted that all of the PCV2 isolates from the United States (USA) until late 2005 belong to group 2 [13, this study] (Fig. 1) , while isolates from other countries may be found in both PCV2 groups. In this communication, we report the presence of PCV2-group 1 isolates in multiple USA swine herds.",

Investigations into these cases found the following: there was a sudden increase in mortality that was at least several times the expected weekly rate; there was a high incidence of unthrifty, anorexic, dyspneic and listless pigs; and the onset of this condition was noticed 4-6 weeks post-placement in the finisher. As the epidemic progressed in the barn, more pigs became affected, and by the end of the finishing phase, the mortality rate ranged from 5 to 50% in a given barn of pigs, with case mortality rates reaching 100% when euthanasia and culling for salvage were included. In the months leading up to these epidemics, there were no obvious changes in husbandry practices, feed supply, source of replacement animals, or hygiene practices that would suggest a source of infection or a linkage among the affected herds. At necropsy, the most consistent lesions among the affected pigs observed were enlarged lymph nodes, pneumonia, icterus and variable amounts of pleural and peritoneal effusions. The most consistent microscopic lesions were lymphoid depletion with granulomatous inflammation, nonsuppurative interstitial pneumonia and nephritis.",

Propagation of various viruses was attempted on multiple cell lines, and cultures that exhibited cytopathic effect (CPE) were then selected for PCR amplification with pathogen-specific primers. Briefly, homogenates (10%) were prepared from various tissues either by trituration with a mortar and pestle, or by using a stomacher. The homogenates were then clarified at 1000\u00c2g for 30 min at 4 C. The recovered supernatant was passed through a 0.45-micron filter before inoculating onto several established cell lines (MARC-145, PK-15 or ST) and a primary porcine fetal lung cell line grown in 24-well plastic cell culture plates. The medium was changed 1-2 hours post-inoculation. The culture was maintained in 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37 C and observed daily for CPE. All negative cultures were frozen and then inoculated onto 50-75 and 100% confluent fresh tissue culture cells to look for more CPE-positive samples. In addition, PK-15 cells inoculated with tissue homogenates (with or without CPE) were assayed for porcine parvovirus (PPV) and PCV. The results showed that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine enterovirus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine teschovirus and PCV, but not PPV, were present in one or more of the diseased animals (Table 1 ). Since multiple infectious agents were detected in the affected animals, it cannot be assumed that any one agent was responsible for the observed clinical disease.",

Total cell DNA from the tissue homogenates were subjected to PCR with specific primers capable of amplifying both PCV1 and PCV2 DNA [3] . Restriction enzyme and sequence analyses showed that PCV2, but not PCV1, was detected in one or more tissues of all the affected animals examined. For cloning of the complete viral genome, oligonucleotide primers 1010BF (GCATG GATCCATCACTTCGTAATGGT) and 1010BR (GCATGGATCCAAAAAAGACTCAGTAA) were used in PCR amplification, and the PCR products were inserted into a TA-cloning vector for sequence determination. Seven distinct full-length clones (n10eu, n32eu, iB2, k43c, k52, n10na and n32na) from 6 diseased pigs (3 from North Carolina, 2 from Kansas, and 1 from Iowa) were obtained, and the nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBank (Table 2) . Interestingly, two of the North Carolina pigs (n10 and n32) each contained two distinct PCV2 sequences, while the sequence from pig n19 was identical to one of the sequences obtained from pig n32. Separately, tissues of a healthy pig (hk102) from a neighboring farm (with no signs of disease) in Kansas were also analyzed, and PCV2 DNA sequences were detected. The eight genomic DNAs obtained here and all the available USA PCV2 sequences (18 entries) reported in GenBank as of May 16, 2006 were subjected to phylogenetic analysis together with the data set of Olvera et al. (which included 8 USA sequences) that was used to delineate the two major genotypic groups of PCV2 [20] . In our analysis, we included one PCV1 sequence (NC006266) and excluded 33 of 148 sequences of the data set: sequences that exhibit recombination characteristics and sequences that were removed for the recombination study (i.e., PCV2-group 1 clade B and clade C sequences and the sequences marked with asterisks, respectively). A total of 134 sequences (Table 2) were aligned by the ClustalW method available in the MEGA 3.1 software (http:==www.megasoftware. net) [12] . A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with the Kimura 2-parameter nucleotide substitution model using 1000 bootstrap replicates in the MEGA 3.1 program. The results showed that all the groupings obtained were identical to the results of Olvera et al. [20] (Fig. 1) . Clustered within the PCV2-group 2 were the 18 previously reported USA isolates (clades 2D and 2E), the n10na and n32na sequences (clade 2E) (coisolated with n10eu and n32eu, respectively) from diseased pigs and the hk102 sequence (clade 2D) from the healthy pig from the neighboring farm; while the other five full-length sequences (n10eu, n32eu, iB2, k43c and k52) from six diseased pigs clustered within PCV2-group 1 clade A. Previous studies had concluded that the PCV2 capsid gene is a suitable phylogenetic and epide-miologic marker [7, 20] . To obtain capsid gene sequences specifically, the DNA samples were amplified with oligonucleotide primers 200R (ATTA CCCTCCTCGCCAAC) and 941F (CCAGTTCGT CACCCTTTC), cloned and sequenced ( Table 2 ). The results showed that the viral DNA sequences from different animals were similar but not identical, and at times, more than one capsid gene sequence was detected in the same animal (n3, n13, k43 and k70). Sixteen new capsid sequences from this study and two additional previously reported USA capsid genes (AY129154 and AY129155) (included in Table 2 ) were added to the data set for analysis. Together, a total of 152 capsid gene sequences (87 PCV2-group 1, 64 PCV2-group 2 and 1 PCV1) were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the neighbor-joining method [12] . The results showed that the groupings obtained here were identical to that of the full-length genome analysis (Fig. 2) . Clustered within PCV2-group 2 were the 20 previously reported USA isolates (clades 2D and 2E), the n10na and n32na sequences (clade 2E), and the hk102 sequence (clade 2D); while 21 distinct sequences from the diseased animals (not including n10na or n32na) of this study clustered within PCV2-group 1 clade A.",

Location of nucleotide differences between PCV2-group 1 and PCV2-group 2 isolates that resulted in amino acid changes (above the gene map) are also indicated. The numbers following the amino acid residue indicates the number of times the residue appeared at this location. The proposed amino acid signature motif is indicated by the circled amino acid sequence above the CR gene map",

Cheung et al. is TCA=AAC=CCC=CG (which codes for the 5' portion of amino acid sequence SNPRSV), while the nucleotide sequence at position 1487-1473 for PCV2-group 2 (64 entries) is ACC=AAC=AAA=AT (which codes for the 5' portion amino acid sequence TNKI S[I 62=64 ]). Whether variation of this cluster of six amino acid residues has any effect on the structure and function of the capsid protein remains to be investigated.In this communication, we report the presence of PCV2-group 1 and PCV2-group 2 isolates among swine herds in the USA. Whereas only PCV2group 2 viruses have been reported in the USA prior to this report, both PCV2 groups have been reported in Europe and in Asia [17, 26] . It is not clear how long PCV2-group 1 isolates have been present in swine herds in the USA or the comparative pathogenic capability of these two groups of PCV2. The sudden appearance or increased prevalence of PCV2-group 1 viruses in diseased swine from widely separated locations in the United States suggests that the emergence or import of a new PCV2 genotypic group is a concern for the swine industry.",
