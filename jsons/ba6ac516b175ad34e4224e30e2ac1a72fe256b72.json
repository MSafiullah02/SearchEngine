Many named diseases are recognised with most having a highly varied clinical presentation indicating the likely involvement of numerous factors in lesion pathogenesis. To be accepted as an autoimmune disease, tissue damaging lesions or metabolic dysfunctions must be the consequence of either an antibody or T cell orchestrated response to one or more host components. In some diseases the spectrum of autoreactivity is focused and a single cell type or organ may be involved. A good example is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In others, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple self components are targets of autoreactivity and these may increase with time. The pathogenesis and control of autoimmune disease are far better understood than is their aetiology.",

However, in reality, potentially autoreactive lymphocytes are present in normal individuals, but usually these cells are either not activated or are tolerised. Furthermore, it has become apparent that lymphocyte receptors, particularly on T cells, may be highly degenerate in their recognition specificity [1, 2] . Accordingly, a single receptor may react with multiple epitopes, many of which may not be closely related in primary amino acid sequence with each other. Indeed, by some estimates, a single T cell receptor may react with up to 10 6 different ligands [1, 2] . Such degeneracy means that a T cell clone expanded following antigen triggering could react with numerous other epitopes including self peptides presented by self MHC. Given this circumstance, a central question arises: why doesn't autoimmunity occur all of the time? In fact it does, but tissue damaging autoreactivity (i.e. autoimmune disease), is a relative rarity requiring a complex series of events to occur.",

In humans, as well as animal models, there is a strong genetic susceptibility component that always involves multiple genes. In humans at least ten genes have been implied to influence susceptibility with genes of the MHC class II complex usually playing the major role [3] . Nevertheless, with AID genetics alone never accounts for disease induction or expression. For instance, an autoimmune disease of the same type never occurs in monozygous siblings more frequently than 50% and this frequency is lower if such siblings are raised in different environments [4, 5] . Accordingly, AID occurs in genetically susceptible individuals but many other factors must also be involved. These nongenetic factors are assumed to include environmental components, dietary constituents and infectious agents, particularly viruses. Viruses, in fact, have been implicated as initiators, perpetuators and most recently as terminators of AID [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

(A) They are the consequence of a specific recognition event set off by cross-reactivity between the infecting virus and host autoreactive T cells. This concept is usually referred to as molecular mimicry (MM), and is the most popular idea to explain how viruses induce autoimmunity. (B) They are the consequence of nonspecific inflammatory events set off by viral infections that usually, but not invariably, infect the target organ. This general mechanism has several subcategories. These include unveiling of host autoantigens, bystander activation of autoreactive T cells by inflammatory cytokines, adjuvant effects of virus on antigen presenting cells, superantigen activation of autoreactive T cells and pattern receptor stimulation of autoreactive T cells. These models can all be supported by experiments in various animal models, many of which are highly contrived and express viral antigens, cytokines or costimulator molecules as transgenes or use infecting viruses that express autoantigens as recombinant proteins. For natural AID, especially with human disease, we still do not understand how (or even if) viruses initiate autoimmunity.",

Subsequently, the emphasis shifted to T cell mediated immunity since autoreactive T cells appear more often involved in experimental autoimmunities. Moreover, T cell receptor recognition shows far more degeneracy than does Ig recognition [1, 2] . Several experimental approaches make a powerful argument for MM and the topic has received frequent reviews by its advocates [7, 8, 18] . However, as sanguinely reviewed recently by Benoist and Mathis [19] , the case for MM is compelling but as yet by no means conclusive. We note in passing that the MM hypothesis makes such good sense that it should be correct! Some of the most convincing evidence supporting the MM hypothesis comes from studies in transgenic mouse models of diabetes or encephalitis in which a viral protein is engineered to be a surrogate self antigen [20, 21, 22] . Most studied are models using proteins from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), expressed in the pancreatic islet cells using a rat insulin promoter. Such animals fail to spontaneously develop diabetes although they readily do so if subsequently infected with LCMV [21, 22] . LCMV fails to replicate in the islets of normal mice, so direct viral damage to islets should not complicate issues. Most interpret the model to indicate that the virus infection breaks tolerance and triggers the induction of activated antiviral (but now antisurrogate self) CD8+ T cells which migrate to the islets and destroy b cells that express viral (self) antigens.",

Thus immunisation with the PLP 139-151 requires strong adjuvants to induce EAE and immunisation with the Haemophilus influenzae peptide fails to cause such lesions [6] . Potent adjuvant effects of infectious agents even outside of the target organ for AID can often result in autoimmunity [27] . Thus in a model recently described by the Fujinami group, animals were primed with viruses that expressed autoantigens from the CNS (so called primed for MM). Subsequent challenge after several weeks with nonspecific stimuli such as Freund's adjuvant or viruses that failed to express the relevant peptide and replicated outside the target organ could induce inflammatory effects in the CNS. Although the model was presented as evidence for MM, the triggering effect was in fact entirely nonantigen specific and not in support of MM. Natural infection models have also been described which lend support to the MM hypothesis. The one considered as the most compelling by several writers is herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), a lesion of the mouse cornea that occurs as a sequel to infection HSV [18, 19, 28] . HSV is of course a major pathogen of mankind infecting around 80% of the population and causing HSK lesions in around 500 000 persons in the USA [29] . Mice show major strain differences in susceptibility to HSV infection, an effect attributable to multiple genes and still poorly understood. In the model described by the Cantor group, the basis of resistance and susceptibility to HSK was shown to depend on alleles expressed at the IgH locus [30] . Strains possessing the Igha/d/e alleles were susceptible whereas others, most notably Igh b , were resistant. Resistance appeared to be explained by tolerance to the Igh b gene product, i.e. the IgG2a b isotype of Ig. Thus tolerisation of Igh b mice to IgG2a b Ig or to a peptide derived from this protein (292-308), which was taken to represent the target autoantigen expressed in the cornea during HSK [30] , resulted in resistance. More interestingly a search of the gene bank revealed a peptide in the UL6 protein of HSV that was a potential molecular mimic of the G2a 292-308 peptide [30] . Hence the idea arose that HSK in susceptible strains was the consequence of the UL6 peptide breaking tolerance and inducing autoreactive T cells responsible for orchestrating HSK.",

Furthermore, immunisation with the UL6 peptide, induces a response to itself but this neither crossreacts with HSV nor to the G2a 292-308 peptide [32] . Other aspects of the MM hypothesis for HSK also could not be confirmed [32] . Thus the Cantor model for MM and autoimmunity, just like others cannot be taken as gold standard proof of MM. Indeed, in the case of HSK, it is highly debatable if the lesion is solely or even principally an autoimmune lesion [33] .

Unfortunately, most models that implicate nonspecific mechanisms as responsible for AID are often imprecise and usually confounded by the likelihood that multiple nonspecific activation events could be ongoing. Balanced reviews on the mechanisms by which viruses might induce AID other than by MM have been published [10, 34] . One model which persuasively argues for AID induction other than by mimicry involves Theiler's virus induced encephalomyelitis of mice [35] . In this model, intracerebral injection of virus results initially in the induction of inflammatory lesions that appear to represent a CD4+ T cell mediated immunopathological reaction against expressing cells viral antigen. However, the resultant damage (direct or perhaps bystander) to tissues releases myelin components which somehow induce a progressive wave of autoreactive T cell responses against myelin antigens. Characteristically, the first target autoantigen is PLP 131-159 and a much later one MOG 92-106 [35] . This progressive event is referred to as epitope spreading. A variety of events could be involved in epitope spreading. These include release of sequestered antigens, enhanced antigen presenting cell (APC) activity and the bystander activation effects of cytokines such as gamma interferon and IL-12 [6] . As a consequence of epitope spreading, late lesions resulting from TMEV infection appear to be the consequence of autoreactivity rather than virus induced demyelinating disease.",

Other more exotic means by which viruses could cause, or exacerbate, autoimmunity include superantigen activation of autoreactive T cells [37] and viral induced transformation of autoantigen producing B cells. The latter mechanism has been suggested as a possible means by which EBV could induce SLE [15] and HCV could induce mixed cryoglobulinaemia [38] .",

            "text": "It is probably a safe bet that virus infections can act as triggering factors in the aetiology of some autoimmune diseases. Equally likely is the fact that virus infection alone is not the principal cause of any AID in an outbred animal and that when viruses are involved multiple pathways of immune activation operate. We also imagine that pathways that involve nonantigen specific activation of already existent autoreactive T cells are more common events than is induction by MM. However, the relative importance of MM and nonspecific activation could vary according to the frequency of autoreactive T cells. Thus at low frequency MM could be important, but irrelevant if a high frequency of autoreactive T cells are present. Assuming that viruses that express molecular mimics are as rare as white elephants, persons exposed to others with autoimmunity, or incubating disease, need not be fearful of contracting a MM virus that will set off disease in themselves even if they are closely related to the patient. On the downside, however, we may never have a useful prophylactic viral based vaccine to protect against AID. Research needs to continue to further define mechanisms by which viruses participate in the cause, progression and even termination of AID. The best outcome might be to discover pathways of lesion expression that can be successfully neutralised by smart immunotherapies that include strategically designed recombinant viruses. Perhaps a binding contract between viruses and autoimmunity will one day be written. We hope to be around to witness the ceremony.",
