Moreover, subjects randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily for the 28-day trial were more likely to exhibit a rise in IL-18 levels and that rise was significantly associated with increased mortality.5 Furthermore, subjects treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy were less apt to have a rise in IL-18 levels5; this might explain why methylprednisolone treatment decreased mortality in those with COVID-19 pneumonia associated ARDS from Wuhan, China.2",

Through their mechanism of action, by ARBs increasing viral entry and statins increasing IL-18 levels, these drugs might synergistically promote severe pneumonia, ARDS, and death in the setting of COVID-19, particularly in older individuals who are more likely to be taking these drugs. Investigators reporting on COVID-19 clinical trials or retrospective studies should also include what drugs the subjects are taking at baseline and throughout the illness so the medical community can determine if indeed ARB or statin treatments portend a worse outcome with COVID-19. This is vitally important in a spreading pandemic, potentially victimizing an older population. In the meantime, clinicians need to decide on an individual basis if an ACE-inhibitor should be substituted for an ARB for blood pressure control and if statin treatment should be halted during the pandemic, particularly if statins are being used for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Attention to this might save countless lives.",
