While knowledge regarding the complications and fatality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is evolving, preliminary data from China suggests that patients with pre-existing comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer may be among those at highest risk of not just acquiring the infection but also having worse outcomes (1-3). The risk of adverse outcomes may be even higher for those afflicted with a dual diagnosis, particularly the elderly. This is extremely concerning from a public health perspective since cancer and CVD are amongst the most prevalent diseases worldwide (4) , and the impact of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be devastating for these patients.",

In a study of 1590 people with confirmed COVID-19 in China, 18 patients (1%) had a history of cancer, with lung cancer being most common. A greater proportion of patients with a history of cancer had severe disease, defined as either admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation or death, compared to those without cancer (39% vs 8%, p=0.0003) (9) . Among cancer patients, 3 out of 4 (75%) who had received recent chemotherapy or surgery developed severe disease compared with 6 of 14 (43%) not recently treated for cancer (odds ratio 5.34, 95% CI 1.80-16.18; p=0.0026), even after adjusting for other risk factors, including age, smoking history, and other comorbidities (9), suggesting potentially that recent antineoplastic therapy may impair immunity and impact the outcomes related to COVID-19. The mortality rate in this small study was also significantly higher in cancer patients: 5.6% compared to approximately 1% general COVID-19 related mortality (9) . An updated WHO report demonstrates a similarly high mortality of 7.6% among patients with cancer (2) . Data regarding the type of cancer or antineoplastic therapy is not available in these early reports; however, patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy and those with hematological malignancies and baseline lymphopenia theoretically may be at even higher risk for adverse consequences.",

As the landscape of COVID-19 continues to change rapidly, for patients with stable cancer in areas with high transmission of SARS-CoV-2, postponing antineoplastic therapy or elective surgery may need to be considered. This decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after careful discussion with the treating physicians, based not only on cancer type and status, but also considering the overall health of the patient and the type of antineoplastic therapy needed. For patients undergoing cancer therapy or with a recent history of stem-cell transplantation in areas of high transmission, it is reasonable to consider \"self-quarantine\" to avoid exposure. Also, as testing for SARS-CoV-2 becomes more widely available, close contacts of such high-risk patients should have a low threshold to \"self-quarantine\" or obtain testing if they have any concerning symptoms.",
