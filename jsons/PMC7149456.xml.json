Productive replication requires cellular factors that are expressed only during cell differentiation and division (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986; Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987). They account for the predilection of parvoviruses for mitotically active cells and the pathogenicity of several serotypes. Infection begins with binding of virions to cell receptors, internalization by endocytosis, and transport to the nucleus where they replicate and from which they are released during apoptic or lytic cell death. Recent evidence from in vivo studies also suggests that productive replication may not lead irrevocably to cell lysis (Jacoby, et al., 2000) a possibility that requires confirmation. In this context, nonproductive infection (abortive, cryptic, or restrictive) has been demonstrated in vitro for the murine parvovirus, minute virus of mice (MVM) but not for the parvoviruses of rats (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986; Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987; Jacoby and Ball-Goodrich, 1995; Jacoby et al., 1996).",

They also encode two capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2, which are serotype specific. VP2 is the major capsid protein, although its sequence is contained within the VP1 coding region. A third capsid protein, VP3, results from the proteolytic cleavage of VP2 but is present in only minute quantities in mature virions.",

The prototype agent is rat virus (RV), which was isolated from a transplantable neoplasm of rats by Kilham and Olivier (Kilham and Olivier, 1959). Therefore, it also has been called Kilham rat virus (KRV). An antigenically distinct virus (H-1 virus) was isolated shortly afterward by Toolan from a human tumor cell line that had been passaged through rats (Toolan et al., 1960). A third serotype, rat parvovirus (RPV), was isolated recently from naturally infected rats (Ball-Goodrich, et al., 1998). A similar agent has been identified by Japanese workers who initially referred to it as \u201crat orphan parvoviruscenter (Ueno et al., 1996). Most recently, three strains of a putative fourth serotype have been identified by Wan and co-workers (Wan et al, 2002), which they have named, collectively, minute virus of rats. The genomic and amino acid sequences for these isolates are closely related to KRV and H-1 virus but are significantly different from RPV. Because parvovirus infections remain prevalent among laboratory rats and have the potential to distort rat-based research results, efforts to detect, eliminate, and exclude them should receive justifiably high priority.",

This reflected interest in using these agents for developing rodent models of virusinduced birth defects. Contemporary studies have emphasized inoculation by natural (oronasal) routes at various ages in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient rats to resemble more closely exposure during natural outbreaks (Jacoby et al., 1987, 1988, 1991; Gaertner et al., 1989, 1993, 1995, 1996).",

            "text": "\nAgents. The three documented serogroups of parvoviruses infective for rats (RV, H-1 virus, and RPV) each contain multiple isolates. Because they are small, nonenveloped viruses, they are highly resistant to environmental inactivation (Yang et. al., 1995), a characteristic that complicates control and elimination. Early work with RV and H-1 virus showed that they retain infectivity after exposure to lipid solvents and are stable over a pH range of 1 to 12 (Siegl, 1976). They also are highly heat resistant. For example, RV can remain infectious after exposure to 80\u00b0C for up to 2 hours and for up to 60 days at 40\u00b0C. Rodent parvoviruses are resistant to ultrasonication, treatment with RNAse, DNAse, papain, and trypsin\u2014properties which, however, also facilitate preparation of purified virus from infected cell cultures. RV and H-1 agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes and aggregate, to variable degrees, erythrocytes of other species (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986). This property was useful for serotyping viral isolates by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), a method that has been superseded by more modern serodiagnostic tests, discussed below. There is no evidence that strains within a given serogroup are antigenically distinguishable, even though they may differ in nucleic acid sequence, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity. For example, RV-UMass and RV-Y belong to the same serogroup, but RV-UMass appears to replicate faster in vitro and to be more pathogenic in vivo (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2001).",

Productively infected cells usually develop cytopathic effects (CPE), beginning with intranuclear inclusions and proceeding rapidly to cytolysis. The kinetics and severity of CPE depend on virus strain and dose and the level of confluence of the cell substrate. High concentrations of input virus can induce intranuclear antigen indicative of replication within 12 hours and CPE within several days, whereas low concentrations may not induce measurable effects for a week or more. Cultures that contain actively dividing cells are more susceptible to viral infection and replication than confluent cultures.",

It is unclear whether intrauterine mortality reduces a dam's subsequent reproductive performance. Infection in late pregnancy or within several days after parturition can cause severe or fatal disease in infants, particularly due to hemorrhage and necrosis in the liver and central nervous system (Kilham and Margolis, 1966; Cole et al., 1970; Margolis and Kilham, 1970). Signs in affected infants can include ataxia, icterus, and diarrhea, or sudden death (Figs. 12-1\nand 12-2\n). Rats that survive acute disease may have locomotion deficits or may die later from chronic active hepatitis and progressive hepatic fibrosis. Although clinical signs are rare in rats exposed to virus beyond 1 week after birth, fatal hemorrhagic lesions have been reported in weanlings and immunosuppressed adults (El Dadah et al., 1967; Coleman et al., 1983).

Based largely on studies with RV, infections should be considered highly contagious, ratto-rat transmission occurring primarily by contact with infectious animals per se or particulate contaminants, such as animal bedding (Jacoby et al., 1988; Yang et al., 1995). Both RV and RPV (and presumably H-1 virus) infect renal tubular epithelium (Figs. 12-3\nand 12-4\n) which facilitates excretion in urine. There is some evidence that RV can infect intestinal mucosa and lead to fecal excretion (Lipton et al., 1973), but intestine does not appear to be a prominent target tissue. Intestinal infection is prominent with RPV, although affecting predominantly the lamina propria Fig. 12-5\n). Therefore, its contribution to fecal excretion of virus is unresolved. Natural postnatal exposure to parvoviruses of rats appears due to inhalation and, or ingestion of virus or virus-contaminated fomites. Prenatal transmission is secondary to maternal infection. However, it appears to require exposure of dams to large doses of virus and/or virulent strains (of RV or H-1 virus) (Kilham and Margolis, 1966; Jacoby et al., 1988;\nGaertner et al., 1996; Kajiwara et al., 1996).

These properties have been clearly established for RV but should be assumed for all parvoviruses of rats. Susceptibility to persistent RV infection depends heavily on age and immunologic status. Infection in adult immunocompetent rats is usually eliminated within 4 weeks, whereas pre- or perinatal infection can lead to persistent infection lasting at least 6 months, despite the onset of antiviral humoral immunity (Gaertner et al., 1989, 1991, 1995; Jacoby et al., 1991). Persistently infected rats also can excrete virus for up to 3 months, and episodic excretion over longer periods cannot be ruled out (Jacoby et al., 1988). Passive immunization with RV immune serum protects rats from acute and persistent infection (Gaertner et al., 1991). Similarly, maternally acquired immunity appears to protect rats born to persistently infected dams (Jacoby et al., 1988). However, passive immunity is most effective if it is established prior to infection. Antibody administered even 1 day after exposure to virus provides only partial protection against infection. Thus, the potential for persistent infection develops soon after virus reaches its cellular targets. Immunodeficient (athymic) rats, unsurprisingly, are susceptible to persistent RV infection at any age (Gaertner et al., 1989). Administration of RV-immune serum to infected athymic adults suppresses but does not eliminate virus, which can reemerge after immunity decays (Gaertner et al., 1991). The environmental stability of RV has been demonstrated by Yang and co-workers, who found that virus remained infectious on plastic surfaces for at least 5 weeks (Yang et al., 1995).",

Pioneering studies by Kilham, Margolis, Toolan, Cole, Nathanson, and others indicated that the predilection of RV and H-1 virus for mitotically active cells was responsible for pathogenic infections in fetal and infant rats, especially in the liver, central nervous system, and lymphopoietic tissues (Toolan et al., 1960; Kilham and Ferm, 1964; Kilham and Margolis, 1966; Margolis et al., 1968; Cole et al., 1970; Novotny and Hetrick, 1970). Virus infection in these tissues has been documented more recently by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993), indicating that oronasal exposure leads to viremic dissemination. Lesions caused by pathogenic strains are often widespread but most readily detected in liver, which is both susceptible to infection and mitotically active during infancy. Viral replication causes intranuclear inclusions Fig. 12-6\n), followed rapidly by degenerative changes, including ballooning degeneration, intensified cytoplasmic eosinophilia, dissociation of histoarchitecture, nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and cell lysis. Associated lesions may include focal hemorrhage, bile stasis, and formation of blood-filled spaces resembling peliosis hepatis. These changes are reflected by gross lesions that may include icterus and yellow-red mottling of the liver accompanied by distorted lobular contours caused by necrosis. Attempts at repair result in increased mitotic activity, which may include the formation of polyploid giant cells. Persistent infection can incite chronic active hepatitis. Portal triads in affected livers may sustain chronic inflammation with infiltration by mononuclear cells, fibrosis, nodular hyperplasia, and biliary hyperplasia Fig. 12-7\n). Corresponding gross lesions can include fibrosis and nodular distortion of one or more lobes.",

Infection may cause cells to swell or lyse, thereby disrupting vascular integrity. Baringer and Nathanson (1972) found that platelet-fibrin aggregates attached preferentially to RV-infected cells and suggested that endothelial infection activated the clotting mechanism, resulting in infarction and hemorrhage. Additionally, RV infection of megakaryocytes with resulting thrombocytopenia can occur during acute infection (Margolis and Kilham, 1972). Endothelial infection may also exacerbate viremia and facilitate fetal infection through involvement of placental and fetal vasculature.",

Standard pathologic examination can be useful, especially to detect inclusions and/or lesions compatible with pathogenic infection. However, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is best achieved with tissue sections by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. Fixation of tissues in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate for not more than 16 hours preserves cytoarchitecture and minimizes denaturation of parvoviral antigens and DNA (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993). Therefore, this method should be used prior to paraffin embedding to permit maximum flexibility in primary and follow-up examination of tissues or cells if parvovirus infection is suspected.",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using virions or infected cells as generic antigens can be used to detect all known serotypes. Alternatively an ELISA using rNS-1 from MPV can detect infection caused by parvoviruses of rats because NS-1 is highly conserved among rodent parvoviruses (Riley et al., 1996). Follow-up testing can employ HAI to directly distinguish RV and H-1 virus infection. Additionally, sera positive by ELISA and/or IFA and negative by HAI would suggest RPV infection. However, the sensitivity of the generic assays is higher than that of HAI, so testing of sera with low concentrations of antibody could produce a false-negative HAI result. Neutralization serology also can be used to distinguish among serotypes, as all replicate in at least one established cell line. This option is comparatively expensive, time consuming, and technically more demanding, making it best suited to use in reference laboratories. The most promising emerging strategy for specific, sensitive cost-effective serologic detection employs recombinant, serotype-specific (capsid) ELISA antigens. They have been produced for RV and RPV as recombinant VP-2 (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002). Addition of a corresponding H-1 antigen should be straightforward.",

Strategies to eliminate infection depend on multiple factors, including the value and immunologic status of infected or exposed animals and the ability to replace them from specific pathogen-free sources. Selective culling can be attempted if animals are housed in isolation or individually ventilated cages, but one must consider risks posed by persistent infection and environmental contamination. Attempts to minimize further transmission should include use of barrier caging and change stations, limiting personnel traffic, barrier garb, and strict adherence to room order entry and sanitation during cage changing, including heat sterilization of soiled equipment and supplies.

They replicate in the cytoplasm and are released by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum (Compton et al., 1993). They are widespread among mammals and birds, including laboratory rats and mice, but individual viruses are largely species-specific. Classification of the coronaviruses of rats has been somewhat confused by the context in which the two prototype strains were initially identified. In 1964, Hartley and co-workers detected antibodies in rat sera to a common coronavirus of mice, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which suggested that rats were susceptible to an antigenically related agent (Hartley et al., 1964). Parker and associates subsequently isolated a coronavirus from lungs of clinically normal rats which became widely known as Parker's rat coronavirus (Parker et al., 1970). Within several years, a second coronavirus was isolated by Bhatt and co-workers from rats with sialodacryoadenitis and was named sialodacryoadenitis virus (Bhatt et al., 1972). Subsequent studies showed that RCV and SDAV were similar antigenically and physicochemically, and that both induced sialodacryoadenitis and inflammation of the respiratory tract. Therefore, RCV and SDAV should be perceived as different strains of a coronavirus indigenous to rats and called, most inclusively, RCV (Percy and Williams, 1990).",

Mild infection can be clinically silent and revealed first by seroconversion of sentinel or index rats, but clinical signs are common in many outbreaks. They can occur in non-immune rats of any age, usually last about a week, and occur in various combinations and with varying severity (Jacoby et al., 1975; Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985). Early signs, especially in sucklings, often include squinting, photophobia, and lacrimation Fig. 12-15\n). Older rats frequently develop audible sneezing and palpable enlargement of cervical salivary glands. Closer examination may also reveal serous nasal discharge and pawing at the external nares resulting in wet forefeet. Red-tinged discharges containing porphyrin (chromodacryorrhea) may stain periorbital and perinasal skin Fig. 12-16\n). Severe ocular inflammation is expressed initially as keratoconjunctivitis, which may resolve quickly or become chronic. Chronic ocular inflammation can lead to corneal opacities and ulcers, pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaioglobus (Lai et al., 1976) (Figs. 12.17\nand 12.18\n). Ancillary effects attributable to the discomfort of infection include transient anorexia and weight loss (Sato et al., 2001) and disruption of estrus (Utsumi et al., 1978, 1980). Additionally, birth rates and fertility in breeding colonies have been observed to markedly decline during acute epizootics. Although morbidity may be high, RCV infection rarely causes mortality. Most rats recover, with the most frequent long term sequelae associated with ocular disease.",

            "text": "Colony infections often occur in either of two patterns: explosive epizootics among non-immune animals or endemic infection in rooms where young rats are protected transiently by maternal antibody. Non-immune, immunocompetent rats excrete virus in oronasal and lacrimal discharges for about 1 week (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985). The onset of antiviral immunity terminates infection and is most easily detected by seroconversion. Immunity offers protection against recurrence of clinical disease, but protection is relatively short-lived (< 6 months) and does not preclude transient re-infection, virus shedding, and a resultant increase in antibody titer (Percy et al., 1990a; Weir et al., 1990a; Percy et al., 1991; Percy and Scott, 1991). Re-infection of seropositive animals implies exposure to antigenically variant strains. This risk is inherent to coronavirus infections because of spontaneous mutations leading to the emergence of variant strains, especially during endemic infection. Infection of immunodeficient (e.g., athymic) rats is persistent (Weir et al., 1990b; Hajjar et al., 1991). Such rats can sustain chronic necrosis and inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands and the respiratory tract, as described below. Additionally, they can excrete virus for prolonged periods because their capacity for immune elimination of infection is impaired. Apart from oronasal and lacrimal excretion, immunodeficient rats can develop urinary tract infection, which makes transmission by contaminated urine likely. In contrast to the prolonged course of RCV infection in athymic rats, Hanna and co-workers (Hanna et al., 1984) found that immunosuppression with prednisolone had a negligible effect on the course of infection, and treatment with cyclophosphamide resulted in only a modest prolongation.",

The submandibular and parotid salivary glands and adjacent cervical connective tissue are often edematous and the glands proper may be pale yellow to white, with red spots caused by vascular congestion Fig. 12-19\n). The cervical lymph nodes also may be enlarged, edematous and contain multiple red foci. The exorbital and infraorbital lacrimal glands also may be pale and enlarged, whereas the Harderian lacrimal gland located on the dorso-lateral and posterior aspects of the eye globe may be flecked with yellow-gray foci. Reddish-brown mottling of the Harderian gland, however, indicative of porphyrin pigment, is a normal finding. The thymus may be small (as a result of stress atrophy) and the lungs may contain small grey foci. The external nares and eyes may reveal serous exudate and staining of adjacent skin by porphyrin pigment. Acute ocular inflammation includes corneal opacities and swollen conjunctiva, whereas advanced ocular disease may, as noted above, include pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaloglobus (Lai et al., 1976).",

The course of infection and tissue repair is sufficiently prolonged (4\u20136 weeks) to facilitate detection of acute or reparative stages, provided the number of rats sampled is adequate. Because acute lesions develop within 5 days of exposure to virus and are often reflected in clinical signs, it is best to select animals for pathologic study that have active clinical signs or have been in recent contact with clinically affected animals.

Porphyrintinged naso-ocular discharges can occur when rats are subject to other stressors, or during other infectious diseases of the respiratory tract such as mycoplasmosis. Irritants such as ammonia can cause photophobia and lacrimation. Respiratory tract lesions due to RCV should be differentiated from those caused by Sendai virusa recently recognized and putative hantavirus-like respiratory virus of rats (Simmons and Riley, 2002), pneumonia virus of mice, or pathogenic bacteria such as Mycoplasma pulmonis. One cannot exclude, in this regard, the potential for RCV to facilitate or exacerbate secondary bacterial infection (Michaels and Myerowitz, 1983).

Effective use of barrier equipment and procedures is essential to control and prevent RCV infection, because it spreads rapidly and can remain endemic in any colony where non-immune rats are regularly added. However, rapid spread and limited duration also can be exploited toward control; that is, it is reasonable to expect that, in a given colony room, all rats should be infected and develop immunity within 3 to 5 weeks. This latter interval may be longer among rats housed in static isolation caging or in individually ventilated caging. Thus, strict quarantine of infected rooms is essential for at least 5 weeks, and preferably 6 to 8 weeks. Additionally, quarantined rooms should be kept under negative air pressure with respect to shared corridors and should be serviced last. Personnel entering barrier or quarantined animal rooms should wear protective garb and should not enter rooms housing uninfected rats without thorough personal sanitation steps, as fomite transmission of RCV can occur (La Regina et al., 1992). Cages should be serviced in HEPA-filtered stations and soiled equipment should be sent for sanitation by a predetermined and secure route, to prevent cross-infection. Finally, serologic testing should be intensified in adjacent colonies to determine if quarantine has been effective in containing the spread of infection. The quarantine period can be reduced by purposefully exposing all rats to infection, which will accelerate the development of immunity, provided that it will not interfere with research objectives. Production should cease in breeding colonies for about 6 weeks. After this interval, seropositive rats can be moved to a different room to resume breeding, because they should no longer be contagious (Brammer et al., 1993). Here, as well, purposeful exposure of breeding stock will accelerate colony-wide immunity, which also will lead to protection of normally susceptible litters by maternally acquired immunity. The foregoing strategies assume that attempts will be made to salvage infected animals. Under certain conditions, such as those applicable during pharmacologic testing, even transient infection and RCV seropositivity may not be tolerable and may require euthanasia of entire colonies.",

Elimination of virus coincides with the onset of antiviral immunity at about 1 week after initial exposure. Because infection is highly contagious and transmitted by aerosol, rapid spread is common. This effect has been documented by Makino and co-workers (et al., 1972) who observed infection in a colony of 500 breeding rats with subsequent outbreaks re-occurring at 8- to 10-month intervals as newly susceptible rats emerged from the breeding program. Signs of respiratory disease and retarded growth among suckling rats occurred during each episode. Endemic infection is punctuated by fresh clinical outbreaks, typical for acute viral infections in which recovery leads to transient maternally derived immunity followed by renewed susceptibility. Antibody responses to virus remain high for at least several months after acute infection, but decline to low or undetectable levels within 9 months. In these contexts, the epidemiologic pattern and risks from Sendai virus infection in rats resemble those described for RCV infection. However, there is no specific evidence regarding long-term risks for re-infection with Sendai virus. Infection has not been described in immunodeficient rats, but one should assume, as for immunodeficient mice, that it would persist in individual animals and that the risks for transmission would be high.

Patterns of infection and lesions are similar in infant, weanling, and young adult rats, but viral clearance is slower in infants (Castleman, 1983; Castleman et al., 1987; Giddens et al., 1987). Thus, virus can be detected beyond the first week of infection, whereas older rats generally clear virus by 1 week. This difference is reflected in a slower onset of humoral anti-Sendai virus immunity in infant rats. Infection causes rhinitis with subsequent development of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Grossly, affected portions of lung are dark red and consolidated. Otitis media may develop in some rats. Upper respiratory lesions begin within 4 days of exposure to virus, but viral antigen can be detected in respiratory epithelium within 1- to 2 days. Early lesions are characterized by epithelial necrosis with mucosal infiltration by neutrophils and lymphoid cells, all of which increase in severity during the ensuing week. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia may begin as early as 2 days after exposure to virus and feature necrosis and inflammation Fig. 12-27\n). Bronchiolar epithelium undergoes necrosis and erosion, which may be accompanied by epithelial hyperplasia. Viral replication occurs in type I and type II pneumocytes and in macrophages, resulting in necrosis and interstitial infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Pneumonic lesions are most severe at 5 to 8 days, depending on the age of affected rats, with lesions peaking earlier in weanling or young adult rats than in infant rats. Resolution of pneumonia in immunocompetent rats begins within 2 weeks after exposure and is largely complete within 3 weeks. Residual lesions include perivascular and peribronchial accumulations of mononuclear cells, which may last up to several weeks. Some rats may develop interstitial fibrosis.",

Immunohistochemistry to detect viral antigen can be performed on aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues harvested during acute infection. Respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes should be examined for intracytoplasmic viral antigen.

Black Creek Canal virus, a strain that is highly virulent for humans, has been isolated from cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and implies that extreme caution should be employed if wild-caught cotton rats are used for research. In fact virtually all hantaviruses are known or have the potential to be zoonotic for man with varying pathogenicity ranging from asymptomatic to lethal infection. A newly recognized agent, named rat respiratory virus (RRV), has been detected in laboratory rats with interstitial pneumonia (Simmons and Riley, 2002).

The mechanism(s) of persistence is not well-understood, but prolongs risks for transmission.

The causative agent is an antigenically distinct group B rotavirus that may be of human origin. Infected suckling rats develop clinical signs within a day or two after initial exposure. These include diarrhea for up to 1 week accompanied by cracking and bleeding of the perineal region, dry, flaky skin, and transient growth retardation.

The stomach usually contains milk. The ileum and colon may be distended with yellow-green fluid and gas. Histologic lesions are most prominent in the ileum and are characterized by enterocytic syncytia, which may contain intracytoplasmic inclusions, enterocytic necrosis, and attenuation of villi. Viral antigen and rotaviral particles may be found in affected enterocytes. Diagnosis rests on characteristic clinical and pathologic changes accompanied by detection of rotaviral antigens and/or particles. Serologic assays have not been developed.

For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Although sampling should utilize index animals, such as retired breeders, whenever possible, the most widely accepted approach to assess contemporary conditions in a colony is serologic monitoring of strategically placed and exposed sentinels. Sentinels must be immunocompetent, virus-antibody free, and protected from exposure to infectious agents during shipment. The number of sentinels used should reflect assessment of risks to a colony, as illustrated in Chapter 16. Cages of sentinels should be placed, by rack and room, to facilitate controlled exposure to potential sources of infection. One popular configuration for rats housed in conventional wire-top caging is to place sentinels on the lowest shelf of a rack to maximize natural exposure to bedding expelled from overlying cages. Additionally, samples of soiled bedding collected during routine cage changing (e.g., weekly) can be placed in sentinel cages to increase the sensitivity of detection. This strategy also helps to compensate for the use of isolation and individually ventilated caging, which limits airborne transmission of viral agents and by doing so, also may inhibit early detection of infection. However, limited durability of excreted virus in soiled bedding and the potential that small amounts of virus could be diluted to nonimmunogenic levels in pooled bedding samples also must be considered. Targeted selection of soiled bedding samples also can be helpful to trace infection to a sector of a suspect rack or shelf. For this procedure to work satisfactorily, cage positions should not be changed during the testing interval.",

For example, PCR testing of excreta, soiled bedding, equipment, or surfaces can be used in lieu of virus isolation to help determine if infection initially detected by serology is currently active. Additionally, there is preliminary evidence from studies with mouse coronavirus that PCR sampling of exhaust air manifolds can provide a rapid, \u201crealtime\u201d overview of infection among individually ventilated cage racks (SR Compton, personal communication); however, it remains to be seen whether this technology is applicable to viruses of rats.",

Depending on source, age, gender, animal number and behavioral considerations, sentinel exposures can use soiled bedding or direct placement with index animals. Because cohorts of imported rats are generally small, sentinel exposure for 30 days should be adequate to elicit potential seroconversion. Sampling of animal products destined for in vivo use, such as transplantable tumors or blood products, is essential for a sound monitoring program. It also is important, in this regard, to counsel investigators about the hazards of introducing untested biological products into rats. Aliquots can be tested by inoculation of susceptible cell lines or by molecular methods. The aforementioned RAP test, although apparently sensitive, tends to be costly, time consuming, and likely to be replaced by molecular methods.",

The value of serology to detect infection and determine prevalence and incidence is obvious. As noted in previous sections of this chapter, sensitive and specific tests are available for the most common viruses of laboratory rats. We re-emphasize, however, that the number of test animals should be large enough and the duration of exposure long enough to maximize the likelihood of detecting infection in a room or colony. Further, the clinician/pathologist should have high confidence that the testing laboratory has the testing conditions and expertise to produce incontrovertible results.",

Tissue selection and preservation should be guided by a differential diagnosis emerging from clinical and gross pathology examinations complemented by a sound working knowledge of viral infections of rats. Such knowledge should account for the possibility that signs and gross lesions will be absent. Table 12-1 summarizes current recommendations for tissue collection, preservation, and examination. As noted earlier, aldehyde fixation followed by embedding in paraffin wax is generally suitable for routine histopathology. However, we recommend fixation for approximately 16 hours in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (McClean and Nakane, 1974) if immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization are contemplated, because it provides improved stabilization of viral antigens and nucleic acids. We also recommend freezing selected tissues at \u221260\u00b0 C. These samples can be used for virus isolation, molecular testing, or antibody production testing, as initial results warrant. Careful attention to minimize contamination during collection of such samples is critical, especially if the option for PCR testing is to be preserved. It also is prudent to complement examinations for potential viral infection with other microbiological testing to assess the possibility for dual infections or emergence of opportunistic bacterial infections secondary to viral infection.",

            "text": "If evidence of viral infection is obtained, the decision to take corrective action should be based on several key questions: Is the infection a threat to animal or human health? Is the infection a threat to research at the affected or collaborating sites? What are the options for control and elimination? Are the options epidemiologically effective, minimally disruptive to research, and fiscally sound? What are the options to prevent reinfection? These questions are best addressed through a thorough understanding of the biology and pathobiology of the offending agent and the functional and structural characteristics of the affected vivarium. Characteristics such as mode of spread, environmental stability, duration, and virulence in immunocompetent compared with immunodeficient hosts and known effects on research can lead to well-established actions for containment and elimination that have been illustrated for specific agents in this chapter. Further, working knowledge of viral infections can facilitate extrapolation of what is known to what may be conjectural due to lack of specific data. For example, the predilection of parvoviruses for mitotically active cells should be a generic factor in considering the potential impact of parvovirus infection on research. However, decision-making is likely to become more problematic as the use of genetically altered rats increases. Rats with either targeted or serendipitous alterations in resistance to infection may have correspondingly altered responses to viral infections. This potential is illustrated by cryptic immunodeficiencies in laboratory mice that can occur as unintended sequelae of genetic manipulation. Therefore, it will be important to consider phenotype as integral to risk assessment, and to broaden clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic conception of the \u201ctextbook\u201d spectra of infection.",
