We included in the study 569 Hong Kong Chinese patients with SARS who were admitted to 5 hospitals in Hong Kong between 10 March and 26 April 2003. These 569 patients represented 59.0% of the total 965 patients with SARS who were admitted to these 5 hospitals during the above period. The male to female ratio was similar between the 569 study patients (249:320) and the whole cohort (410:555), and the mean (SD) age of the study patients (41.2 [17.2] years) was similar to that of the whole cohort (40.7 [17.8] years). The patients fulfilled the modified WHO definition of SARS [29]. Either SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion or detection of SARS-CoV RNA in respiratory secretions by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was documented for at least 95% of the patients. The SARS-CoV antibody and RNA test results were obtained from the Government Virus Unit, Department of Health, Hong Kong Government, and the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. The demographic features and outcomes of the patients were obtained from the eSARS database, which is maintained by the Hospital Authority SARS Collaborative Study Group. EDTA whole blood and serum samples\u2014which, after investigations, were archived in the departments of pathology of Pamela Nethersole Youde Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and United Christian Hospital\u2014were obtained from the 569 patients with SARS for genotyping and MBL assay",

The MBL mutant allele B is in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter polymorphism X/Y; therefore, B occurs only with Y [22]. To date, no exceptions to this association have been reported, and, accordingly, the data from the 2 separate TaqMan PCR reactions were combined to give 3 haplotypes: YA, YB and XA. Therefore, 6 genotypes were identified in the present study: YA/YA, YA/XA, XA/XA, YA/YB, XA/YB and YB/YB. YB is 1 of 3 mutant haplotypes commonly referred to as \u201cO\u201d [31, 32]. The other 2 known mutant haplotypes carrying structural polymorphisms, C (codon 57) and D (codon 52), were not tested for in the present study, since they are present at an extremely low frequency and probably were absent in the Chinese population [20, 21]. The frequencies of 2-locus haplotypes composed of the promoter and a structural allele were also estimated by performing the haplotype procedure of SAS/Genetic Software (version 8.2; SAS Institute), as described elsewhere [33]; the expectation-maximization algorithm was used to generate maximum-likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies, given that genetic-marker genotypes are under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)",

Increasing ORs (1.53, 1.81, and 2.21) were indeed observed in the individuals with genotypes carrying 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with high serum levels of MBL (YA) 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with low serum levels of MBL (XA), and 2 mutant haplotypes (YB) (i.e., YA/YB, XA/YB and YB/YB respectively). Since YB is associated with low serum levels of MBL, we further established that patients with SARS had serum levels of MBL that were significantly lower than those in control subjects. We conclude, therefore, that low serum level of MBL is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS; this conclusion further supports the role of MBL as a first line of defense in respiratory infections, as has been documented in many other clinical settings [37\u201340]. For example, polymorphisms associated with low serum levels of MBL have been associated with frequency of respiratory tract infections in children [37], higher risk of invasive pneumococcal disease [38], greater mortality and impaired lung function related to cystic fibrosis [39], and more-frequent hospital admissions with respiratory tract infections related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [40]. Nevertheless, in the present study, XA (low-expression promoter) was not associated with susceptibility to SARS, possibly because the serum level of MBL in XA carriers was higher than that in YB carriers and was already sufficient to avert infection with SARS",

MBL has been shown to function as an opsonin for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus, and to inhibit hemagglutination and the infectivity of several strains of influenza A virus [28]. MBL inhibits hemagglutination and neutralizes the infectivity of influenza A virus by binding to the N-linked high-mannose carbohydrate side chain at the tip of the hemagglutinin S, thereby blocking the access of cell-surface receptors to the receptor-binding site on hemagglutinin [42]. Similarly, the S protein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites [10], and some of the sites are glycosylated with high-mannose structures [12]. MBL selectively binds to mannose, glucose, l-fucose, n-acetylmannosamine, and n-acetylglucosamine, whereas galactose is not bound [43]. Since the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV could be inhibited by mannan and since this binding was Ca2+ dependent, it is likely that the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV is through the interaction of the CRDs of the MBL with the mannose side chains of the S protein of SARS-CoV",

Since MBL may mediate complement activation, as demonstrated by our assay for in vitro deposition of complement C4, and modulate phagocytosis of SARS-CoV by macrophages, resulting in other antiviral responses, the effect of MBL on SARS-CoV in vivo may be more complex. Further experiments to delineate the relative roles between MBL, complement, and macrophages, in control of SARS-CoV infection, are required",

Anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) [44, 46]. Furthermore, a recombinant human antibody against the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to neutralize the virus on Vero E6 cells and inhibit formation of syncytia between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2 [47]. MBL is a serum C-type lectin, and, here, we have demonstrated that MBL binds SARS-CoV per se or infected cells and inhibits the infectivity of the virus on rhesus monkey kidney cells. These findings therefore support the possible role of MBL in the host defense against SARS-CoV infection by targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV before production of specific antibody. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBL-deficient individuals are more susceptible to SARS, and they provide insight into the possible mechanisms of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. It will be important to assess the therapeutic and prophylactic effect of replenishment of MBL in MBL knock-out animal models of SARS",

The amount of MBL binding was also dependent on the amount of SARS-CoV used to coat the wells. C Presence of Ca2+, EDTA, and/or mannan. To determine the nature of binding of MBL to SARS-CoV, MBL was incubated in wells coated with SARS-CoV in the presence of either Ca2+ or EDTA. The binding of MBL to SARS-CoV was reduced to background levels in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the interaction of MBL with SARS-CoV was Ca2+ dependent. Preincubation of MBL with 2 mg/mL mannan in the presence of Ca2+ also substantially reduced binding of MBL to SARS-CoV. These data provide evidence that MBL bound to immobilized SARS-CoV via its carbohydrate recognition domains. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SE and are representative of 4 experiments",
