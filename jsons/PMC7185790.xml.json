However, the initial concern over aviation's global impacts in the early 1970s was related to potential stratospheric ozone (O3) depletion from a proposed fleet of civil supersonic aircraft (e.g., SMIC, 1971), which in the event, was limited to the Concorde and Tupolev-144.",

The EU AERONOX and the US SASS projects (Schumann, 1997, Friedl et al., 1997) and a variety of other research programmes identified a number of emissions and effects from aviation, other than those from CO2, which might influence climate, including the emission of particles and the effects of contrails and other aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC, hereafter). In assessing the potential of anthropogenic activities to affect climate, aviation stands out as a unique sector since the largest fraction of its emissions are injected at aircraft cruise altitudes of 8\u201312 km. At these altitudes, the emissions have increased effectiveness to cause chemical and aerosol effects relevant to climate forcing (e.g., cloud formation and O3 production).",

Radiative forcing (RF) is a measure of the perturbation of the Earth-atmosphere energy budget since 1750 (by convention in IPCC usage) resulting from changes in trace gases and particles in the atmosphere and other effects such as changed albedo, and is measured in units of watts per square metre (W m\u22122) at the top of the atmosphere. The RF components from aviation arise from the following processes:\u2022emission of CO2, (positive RF);\u2022emission of NOx (positive RF). This term is the sum of three component terms: production of tropospheric O3 (positive RF); a longer-term reduction in ambient methane (CH4) (negative RF), and a further longer-term small decrease in O3 (negative RF);\u2022emissions of H2O (positive RF);\u2022formation of persistent linear contrails (positive RF);\u2022aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC; potentially a positive RF);\u2022emission of sulphate particles (negative RF); and,\u2022emission of soot particles (positive RF).\n",

This was largely the result of more realistic assumptions underlying the calculation of contrail RF (which was reduced by more than a factor of three from 33 mW m\u22122 to 10 mW m\u22122 if 1992 traffic is scaled to 2000) and the improvements over the intervening period to the models that were used to assess NOx impacts. For AIC, Sausen et al. (2005) adopted the mean estimate of Stordal et al. (2005) of 30 mW m\u22122, with an uncertainty range of 10\u201380 mW m\u22122.

(2005) and references therein, which reassessed aviation for the year 2000 and provided a best estimate for persistent linear contrails of 10 mW m\u22122. (A \u2018best\u2019 estimate is that estimate resulting from the IPCC assessment process and is usually associated with an uncertainty following IPCC nomenclature. See the Technical Summary of IPCC AR4 WGI (p.23) (IPCC, 2007).) This value is approximately a factor of three smaller than the contrail RF (33 mW m\u22122) that Sausen et al. (2005) obtained for 2000 by scaling the IPCC (1999) figures. The smaller estimate arises principally from recalculations of contrail coverage and space and time dependent optical depths, which have almost linear effects on the calculation of overall forcing (noting that contrail RF is the sum of two forcings, infrared and visible radiation, which have opposite signs). There remain significant uncertainties over contrail coverage and the optical depth of contrails (Schumann, 2005, Forster et al., 2007a). The uncertainties in the contrail coverage arise from the lack of global observations of contrails and the poorly known extent of ice-supersaturation in the upper atmosphere. Ice-supersaturation in the ambient atmosphere along an aircraft flight track is required for the formation of a persistent contrail. Ice-supersaturation is only measured locally with instrumental difficulty (e.g., Spichtinger et al., 2003) and estimated with significant uncertainty by global atmospheric models, although effort is being committed to improving this (Tompkins et al., 2007). The uncertainties in the optical depth derive from uncertainties in the size distribution, number concentration, and shape of ice crystals.",

            "text": "Aviation-induced cirrus cloud cover is thought to arise from two different mechanisms. The first (direct) mechanism is the formation of persistent linear contrails, which can spread through wind-shear to form cirrus-like cloud structures, sometimes called contrail-cirrus, that are eventually indistinguishable from natural cirrus. A limited number of studies have provided estimates of trends in both contrails and AIC based on satellite data of cloudiness trends (Stordal et al., 2005, Stubenrauch and Schumann, 2005, Zerefos et al., 2003, Eleftheratos et al., 2007). The second (indirect) mechanism is the accumulation in the atmosphere of particles emitted by aircraft at cruise altitudes, namely those containing black carbon, sulphate and organic compounds (K\u00e4rcher et al., 2000) that may act as cloud condensation nuclei. Here, the term aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC) is used to include both these mechanisms. Atmospheric models have shown that black carbon particles from aircraft could either increase or decrease the number density of ice crystals in cirrus, depending on assumptions about the ice nucleation behaviour of the atmospheric (non-aircraft) aerosol in cirrus conditions (Hendricks et al., 2005). A change in the upper-tropospheric ice nuclei abundance or nucleation efficiency can lead to changes in cirrus cloud properties (K\u00e4rcher et al., 2007), including their frequency of formation and optical properties, which in turn changes the RF contribution of cloudiness in the upper atmosphere.",

Both these studies used the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) database and derived cirrus cloud trends for Europe of 1\u20132% per decade over the last two decades. A further study using different instrumental remote measurements provided support for such trends (Stubenrauch and Schumann, 2005) but not their magnitude, finding a trend approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those of Zerefos et al. (2003) and Stordal et al. (2005). Stordal et al. (2005) estimated a global RF for aviation cirrus with a mean value of 30 mW m\u22122 and an uncertainty range of 10\u201380 mW m\u22122, assuming similar optical properties to very thin cirrus. IPCC AR4 WGI adopted these values with the caveat that 30 mW m\u22122 does not constitute a \u2018best estimate\u2019 in the same qualitative sense as other evaluated components of anthropogenic climate forcing. Nonetheless, 30 mW m\u22122 is in reasonable agreement with the upper limit value of 1992 aviation-cirrus forcing of 26 mW m\u22122 estimated by Minnis et al. (2004).",

The usage of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for aviation non-CO2 emissions was not considered specifically by WGI (Forster et al., 2007a), as did Prather et al.

The difficulty in formulating a robust GWP for aviation NOx emissions was revealed in that whilst all three aforementioned studies consistently found positive AGWPs for the primary O3 increases and negative AGWPs for CH4 and secondary O3 decreases, the balance of these terms was 100 and 130 in two of the studies, and \u22123 in the third.",

However, the RFI is not an emissions multiplier that can be used to account for aviation's non-CO2 effects from future emissions. This was confirmed by IPCC AR4 WGI (Forster et al., 2007a) in noting that the RFI cannot account for the different atmospheric lifetimes of the different forcing agents involved, as previously explained by Wit et al.

Thus far, a suitable metric to put non-CO2 radiative effects on an equivalent emissions basis to CO2 for future aviation emissions has not been agreed upon because of the difficulties of treating short-lived species and a long-lived species such as CO2 in an equivalent manner. The metric used to compare the climate impacts of long-lived GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol is \u2018equivalent CO2 emissions\u2019 (i.e., emissions weighted with a 100-yr time horizon GWP). The equivalent-CO2 emission metric is a forward-looking metric, calculated for an emission pulse and, hence, suitable for comparing future emissions in a policy context. The RFI metric is primarily a backward looking metric because it can only be used correctly with accumulated emissions of CO2 and therefore is inherently unsuitable as an emissions-equivalency metric for policy purposes. In terms of non-CO2 effects of aviation, the best current option may be to employ an additional policy instrument(s) that would address these effects directly.",

It is clear from Fig. 3 that the IEA fuel sales data consistently indicate larger CO2 emissions than implied by \u2018bottom-up\u2019 inventories. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the inventories shown only estimate civil emissions; military emissions are much more difficult to estimate. Military emissions were calculated to be approximately 11% of the total in 2002 (Eyers et al., 2005), cf. 18% as calculated by Boeing for 1992 (Henderson et al., 1999). Secondly, the IEA data include aviation gasoline, as used by small piston-engine aircraft, but this comprised only <2% of the total in 2000. Thirdly, the inventories are idealized in terms of missions in that great circle distances are often assumed and holding patterns are not included, nor the effect of winds. Finally, some inventories are based only on scheduled traffic, whereas others include estimates of non-scheduled traffic for the main air traffic regions. These various factors conspire to systematically underestimate aviation CO2 emissions, an effect which has been known for some time but still remains difficult to reconcile. Thus, in RF calculations it is important to use the total kerosene fuel sales data to calculate CO2 emissions and, thereby, reflect the total impact of all aviation activities.",

(2005) for 2000, adjusted by a factor of 1.15 to agree with IEA fuel burn (Prather et al., 1999). The O3 RFs are projected forward in time using values of the NOx emission index (EINOx, g NOx kg\u22121 fuel) from IPCC (1999). A linear relationship between O3 RF (or O3 burden) with increases in aircraft NOx emissions at a global scale has been shown elsewhere to be a good approximation (e.g., IPCC, 1999 (Figure 4-3); Grewe et al., 1999, Sausen et al., 1998, K\u00f6hler et al., 2008; and also for shipping NOx perturbations, Eyring et al., 2007) over the range of NOx emissions used in these studies. Similarly, the reference value for the reduction in CH4 RF from NOx is calibrated to the results of Sausen et al. (2005) for 2000 and scaled to the changes in O3 RF via EINOx projections. Thus far, potential non-linearities in the atmospheric chemistry of NOx\u2013O3 production (e.g., Jaegl\u00e9 et al., 1998) have not been clearly exhibited in global models at large scales. Non-linearities have only clearly been manifested at scales smaller than the globe (e.g. Rogers et al., 2002).",

Projecting AIC RF forwards in time is problematic as it is unlikely that the AIC RF scales directly with fuel usage. A better physical basis for scaling both persistent linear contrails and AIC would be to use reported aircraft traffic movements (Gierens et al., 1999) and precise climatology for atmospheric conditions. For linear contrails, however, changes in the overall propulsive efficiency of the aircraft fleet needs to be accounted for in future cases (Gierens et al., 1999), for which a movements-based model (rather than fuel-based) has not currently been established. The potential AIC increase with traffic is likely to be non-linear, since a given grid cell or area of interest may saturate with AIC with additional traffic producing no extra AIC. Currently, there are no adequate physical model estimates of how various aircraft and external factors will influence future AIC. In the absence of such models, AIC is scaled with fuel usage following the approach of IPCC (1999), noting that this may produce an upper estimate of future AIC.",

For the 2000a values, the fuel usage for non-CO2 RFs was calculated with a bottom-up inventory of aviation fuel. The 2000b values derive from the more complete IEA fuel estimates, which were not available at the time. Since this discrepancy was well known and IPCC (1999) also utilized a scaling factor to account for this, the 2000a non-CO2 RFs include an upward scaling of 15%. The newly available IEA data on fuel usage (Fig. 2) shows that this uplift was too small (by about 8%) in Sausen et al.'s (2005) results. The RF for persistent linear contrails remains the same in 2000b, since contrail coverage is normalized to that of regional satellite observations. RF values for AIC were not scaled in 2000b because of their large uncertainty. The CO2 RF presented by Sausen et al. (2005) was calculated in a slightly different way than in the present study; hence, the difference between 2000a and 2000b values. The 2005 RFs were scaled from the 2000b values rather than the 2000a values since it is consistent to use the same fuel basis in the scaling. In terms of the total RF, it makes only a small difference, of the order 1%.",

The forcings that scaled linearly with fuel (i.e., water vapour, sulphate and soot aerosols) increased by 8.4% over the period 2000\u20132005. The RFs for O3 and CH4 scale somewhat differently, since a change in emission index is also expected. For contrails, the percentage increase of 18.2% is a result of not only changing fuel (the basic proxy, see Sausen et al., 1998) but also changes in propulsive efficiency and routings that result in increased contrail coverage (see IPCC, 1999, Chapter 3). Thus, the overall increase of 14% is greater than the 10% bound assumed by Forster et al. (2007a), who did not have the latest traffic and fuel data at their disposal.",

This is because recent assessments of the effect of aircraft NOx on O3 and CH4 forcings from a GWP emission pulse in CTMs/CCMs, or a sustained emission approach, have revealed larger discrepancies between models than might have been expected from a conventional pseudo steady-state simulation (Forster et al., 2007a, Fuglestvedt et al., submitted for publication). LOSUs of low are assigned to water vapour, sulphate aerosol, soot aerosol and contrails for a variety of reasons: most importantly, there are few assessments of water vapour, sulphate and soot RFs. Additionally for soot, the emissions index is only poorly known. For contrails, the LOSU remains low since there is a paucity of observational data of contrail coverage with which global coverage can be normalized. In addition, satellites have difficulty discriminating between visible and sub-visible contrails and assessing the optical thickness, which almost linearly affects the forcing calculation (Meerk\u00f6tter et al., 1999). A LOSU of very low is assigned to AIC, which is somewhat in contradiction to the evaluation scheme set out by Forster et al. (2007a) in that a range is given here. However, this has been done since the original authors (Stordal et al., 2005) provided a range. Overall, a LOSU of low is assigned to total aviation RF, principally because of the non-CO2 factors that represent at least 50% of the total RF.",

(2007a) in which normal or lognormal distributions of values for each RF component were assigned and a Monte Carlo routine used to calculate a discrete PDF for the net anthropogenic radiative forcing. This approach to uncertainties is similar to that outlined by Boucher and Haywood (2001). The assigned uncertainties are associated with the model evaluation of each component forcing and do not include uncertainties in the underlying fuel usage. The median values and 90% likelihood ranges (high/low) of the assumed distributions for each aviation RF component and for the Monte Carlo PDFs are given in Table 2. The distribution widths for linear contrails, AIC and non-aviation (total anthropogenic CO2) forcings are based on AR4 values. For the other aviation RFs, widths used in the IPCC (1999) report were adopted with the exception of water vapour. The minimum water vapour RF of zero given by IPCC (1999) would not be possible to represent within a lognormal distribution framework; therefore a near-zero minimum forcing was chosen to provide a lognormal distribution (see Table 2). The fractional RF values make use of the PDF of net anthropogenic RF from Figure 2.20b of Forster et al. (2007a) (note that this excludes AIC but includes linear contrails).",

This is justified because the CH4 change is directly influenced by the earlier O3 change. As an intermediate step in combining uncertainties, the O3 and CH4 RF terms were combined to form a \u2018Total NOx\u2019 term with a separate Monte Carlo sampling. The Total NOx term in Table 2 and Fig. 4 has a median value of 12.6 mW m\u22122 with a 90% confidence range of 3.8\u201315.7 mW m\u22122 and is considered a best estimate for the Total NOx RF. While the median value is close to the difference between the O3 and CH4 best estimates, the likelihood range is significantly smaller than either the O3 or CH4 range. In this case the Monte Carlo sampling assumed 100% correlation between the terms. IPCC (1999) notes that the uncertainties of these terms are highly correlated. If the correlation is reduced to 50% (0%), the median values changes only slightly to 12.5 (11.6) mW m\u22122 whilst the likelihood range increases to \u221228 to 49 (\u221249 to 67) mW m\u22122. The Total NOx value was combined with the other independent RF terms in the Monte Carlo samplings to calculate the total and fractional aviation RF values in Table 3 and Fig. 4, Fig. 6. It is important to acknowledge that the O3 and CH4 forcings underlying the Total NOx forcing term do not balance each other out on local scales and hence some features of the climate impact of NOx emissions cannot be derived from only the global mean Total NOx forcing.",

For example, some errors in the radiative forcing calculation of O3 would be roughly independent of those in CH4 radiative forcing. A correlation of less than 100% increases the uncertainty in the total aviation RF derived here as noted above. However, the estimated uncertainties in the underlying O3 and CH4 RF terms are likely to be overestimates because they have not been updated from IPPC (1999) and hence do not reflect the increased skill of contemporary CTMs and CCMs (e.g., Fiore et al., 2008, Stevenson et al., 2006). Thus, a 100% correlation is a reasonable compromise until a new multi-model evaluation of the response to aviation NOx emissions is undertaken. We also note that in calculations of the response to aviation NOx, the O3 RF increase and CH4 RF decrease cancel to a large extent in the global mean, but do not cancel geographically because their the regional RF patterns are very different (cf. Prather et al., 1999, their Figs. 6-9). The RF from O3 is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere while the RF from CH4 exhibits a more homogeneous pattern (similar to that of CO2) because of their differing lifetimes.",

Accounting for these additional correlations is likely to reduce the overall uncertainty range. However, the degree of correlation is difficult to estimate as these RFs are so dependent on the location of their emission source and this dependence is largely species specific.

Each aircraft type in the FAST model is defined by seat-capacity banding, so that RPK data could be used to determine the necessary size of the global fleet and its subsequent emissions by incorporating future projections of fuel efficiency. The approach accounted for projected changes in technology using a \u2018traffic efficiency\u2019 concept (i.e., RPK kg\u22121 fuel (Henderson et al., 1999)) that relates emissions to RPK for different aircraft types and allows aggregation at the fleet level. The approach allowed the modelling of the improvements from incorporating more fuel-efficient aircraft into the fleet. Regional forecasts of RPK to 2020 were used from ICAO/FESG to calculate emissions in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. After 2020, global RPK projections to 2050 were calculated using a non-linear Verhulst function with the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) global domestic product (GDP) projections, A1 and B2 (IPCC, 2000), to calculate emissions for 2030, 2040, and 2050 in a similar manner to Henderson et al. (1999). These SRES scenarios, designated here as FAST-A1 and FAST-B2, were chosen because they were the \u2018baselines\u2019 against which assessments of mitigation were undertaken by the IPCC within WGIII for AR4. The overall growth of aviation in scenario B2 is not greatly dissimilar to that of the mid-range IPCC (1999) scenario, Fa1, and the A1 scenario is likewise similar to the upper-range IPCC (1999) scenario, Fe1. The FAST-A1 and FAST-B2 results are shown in Fig. 3 along with other earlier projections. The FAST-A1 and FAST-B2 scenarios include a scaling by a fixed amount of 64 Tg fuel yr\u22121, respectively, in order to be consistent with IEA fuel sales data up to 2005 (Fig. 3). This amount represents the average difference between 1990 and 2000 data from a bottom-up inventory of aviation emissions (Lee et al., 2005), excluding military emissions and IAE data on fuel sales data.",

Instead, the AIC values given in Table 4 are linearly scaled to fuel usage using the 2005 value as a reference in the absence of a more suitable metric, as was done similarly by Prather et al. (1999). However, it is likely that increases in AIC RF with additional air traffic in a given region saturate at some threshold level of additional cloud cover.

Some efficiency gains have also come about through improved airframe aerodynamics and material changes that have reduced weight. In the near term, it is envisaged that most of the further improvements will be brought about through increased usage of lightweight materials.

Usage of LH2 would require much larger airframe storage capacity, which would add weight and drag to conventional airframes. Critically, the production of the LH2 fuel would need to be carbon-neutral (i.e., energy from renewable resources) in order for it to offer real advantages over kerosene in mitigating and minimizing the future climate impacts of aviation operations. There is consensus that development of such technologies is at least a decade or more away and most likely will only be pursued if there is a more general move to a hydrogen-based fuel economy. Hydrogen powered aircraft would produce more contrails than kerosene-powered aircraft because of increased water vapour emissions, which could potentially produce contrails that have a smaller optical depth than conventional contrails. Therefore, the benefit in terms of total RF of using LH2 fuel would only become apparent a few decades after introduction of this alternative fuel (Marquart et al., 2001, Ponater et al., 2006).",

The most obvious reductions in fuel usage might come about from an improved air traffic management system that would better optimize cruise altitudes through reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM) and reduced delays and holding patterns on arrival. A EUROCONTROL study (Jelinek et al., 2002) showed that the introduction of RVSM over Europe might result in a reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions of 1.6\u20132.3% over the prior conditions. However, it should be stressed that optimizing the air traffic management system is a one-off saving and not one that could be incrementally further improved upon.",

Parametric modelling studies (Fichter et al., 2005, Grewe et al., 2002, Gauss et al., 2006) indicate that effects from contrails and O3 can generally be reduced by lowering overall cruise altitudes. These studies did not propose implementing blanket reductions in cruise altitudes on a global basis but rather simply tested the hypothesis of a reduced effect via a parametric study. Mannstein et al. (2005) suggested that only minor tactical changes of altitude would be necessary on real flights to avoid ice-supersaturated regions, should suitable data become available on this parameter that would allow flight-by-flight prediction of contrail formation. However, their analysis was based on only one region with the majority of layers being \u223c510 m (with a standard deviation of 600 m) \u2013 in many regions cirrus clouds form over layers 1\u20132 km think, so that generalizations in the absence of better statistics of supersaturated regions are premature. However, there are tradeoffs that need to be considered in that reductions in cruise altitudes would incur a fuel burn penalty which is not straightforward to quantify, since the RF effects of CO2 emitted on a particular flight are longer lasting than those of a contrail formed during the same flight (Wit et al., 2005, Forster et al., 2006, Forster et al., 2007b).",

Others have examined the potential impacts of an en route emissions charge (Wit and Dings, 2002) and concluded that if it were applied in a non-discriminatory manner that it would not make a significant impact on competition between European and non-European carriers.

However, consensus at the global level through ICAO on the introduction or use of economic instruments has not been reached thus far. As a result, the European Commission (EC) has embarked upon the development of a climate policy for CO2 \u2013 emissions trading \u2013 that includes international aviation. The EC presented proposals in 2006 on the development of an emissions trading scheme that will bring aviation within the existing trading scheme within Europe. This proposal was controversially discussed between the EC, the European Parliament and the European Council, and in 2008, resulted in a compromise, according to which all flights within the EU and all flights to/from European airports will be covered from 2012 onwards, and the emissions will be capped at average levels over the period 2004\u20132006. A model analysis projects an emissions reduction of 46% over a base case by 2020, mainly through the purchase of allowances from other sectors and emissions savings made elsewhere (EC, 2006). Recently, at the General Assembly of ICAO in September, 2007, market-based options for controlling emissions of aviation CO2 were discussed. ICAO has endorsed the concept of an open, voluntary emission trading system but has not initiated such a system. In response to the proposal of the European Commission to include non-European carriers arriving or departing at European airports into the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the 2007 General Assembly of ICAO urged Member States not to apply an emissions trading system on another state's airlines \u201cexcept on the basis of mutual agreement between those States\u201d. In response to this Assembly Resolution, all 42 European Member States of ICAO entered a formal reservation and stated that they did not intend to be bound by it (ICAO, 2007).",

Considering fleet renewal brings in the complexity of the rate at which new technology enters the fleet and older aircraft are retired. The combined rate manifests itself as the average age of the global fleet, which is declining for passenger transport but generally increasing for freighter aircraft (Airbus, pers. comm.). Freighter aircraft were only 8% of the global fleet in 2006 (Airbus, 2007) but it should be noted that most freight is carried in the holds of passenger aircraft. Load factors for freight carried in passenger aircraft are not usually available because of the commercially sensitive nature of the data. However, by optimizing the freight-carrying-capacity, this offers further opportunities for improvement in traffic efficiency. Average aircraft size has also increased over the years both for regional (<100 seats) and larger (>100 seats) aircraft (Airbus, 2007) (Fig. 9\n). All these factors together tend to improve the efficiency of air traffic in terms of RPK (kg fuel)\u22121. The efficiency of the air transport infrastructure is the only factor that tends to oppose overall traffic efficiency; there have been increases in delays which are symptomatic of infrastructural congestion which tends to decrease fuel and traffic efficiencies. What this complex picture shows, however, is that recent improvements have not come from better technology alone (i.e., newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft), but rather from a number of factors that affect the composition of the global civil aviation fleet in terms of size, age and utilization rate.",

These non-CO2 effects in terms of RF were approximately equal to the CO2 RF in 2005, which yields an RFI (see Section 2.4) of about 2. Including AIC effects increases the RFI to approximately 3. The RFI metric has often been misinterpreted outside of the scientific community as a multiplier to use with CO2 emissions to give a total equivalent-CO2 emission for future aviation scenarios. When used correctly, the RFI gives a numerical indicator of the additional climate effect associated with non-CO2 RFs evaluated for a specific date. The magnitude of the RFI for future scenarios is largely dependent upon the growth rate of aviation emissions: if fleet emissions remained unchanged at 2005 values indefinitely, the RFI would approach a value of approximately 1.5 (excluding AIC) (Wit et al., 2005, Forster et al., 2006, Forster et al., 2007b). This is because the CO2 RF increases over time from the steady accumulation of aviation CO2 emissions in the atmosphere whilst the non-CO2 RFs would remain constant under such a hypothetical scenario, in the absence of technological improvements.",

In the period 2007\u20132008, fuel prices increased dramatically and this may impact upon the future growth rate of aviation. Mitigation measures by technological means could potentially slow the rate at which aviation RF increases. Other measures include market-based and regulatory measures. Market-based measures are usually preferred by many sectors, including aviation. In this class of measures, the primary contender is emissions trading, which in the case of aviation is largely seeking to reduce CO2 emissions under a \u2018cap and trade\u2019 scheme. There are prospects for a regional scheme being implemented in the next 5 years or so within the EU that includes all internal EU traffic plus all arriving and departing aircraft (see Section 5.3). The overall geographical scope of the envisaged scheme may be legally challenged by non-EU States.

Traffic data were available up until 2007, which showed an increase of RPK of 38% between 2000 and 2007 (average growth rate of 5.3% yr\u22121). The increases occurred despite a number of world-changing events such as the Gulf War and SARS that threatened global aviation use. The recalculated aviation RFs for 2005 revealed a total of 55 mW m\u22122 (excluding AIC), a 14% increase over the 2000 value assumed by IPCC (2007). In addition, PDFs were derived to represent the uncertainty in each aviation component in a manner consistent with previous analyses. The PDFs were combined using a Monte Carlo analysis to derive a PDF for the total aviation RF and the fraction it represents of total anthropogenic RF. From these, the 2005 aviation total RF of 55 mW m\u22122 has a 90% likelihood range of 23\u201387 mW m\u22122, excluding AIC. Including AIC yields a median value of 78 mW m\u22122 with a 90% likelihood range of 38\u2013139 mW m\u22122. These new results indicate that aviation represents a 3.5% share of total anthropogenic forcing in 2005 (90% likelihood range of 1.3\u201310%), excluding AIC, or a 4.9% share (90% likelihood range of 2\u201314%) including AIC.

Forecasts of RPK were used from ICAO/FESG to calculate emissions in 2020 and further projections of RPK to 2050 were linked to GDP scenarios from the IPCC. Aviation emissions were then derived from the RPK estimates with assumptions defining the aviation fleet traffic efficiencies. From emissions, RF values were calculated using scaling methodologies. For a forecast of traffic growth out to 2020, the overall forcing was estimated to be 84 mW m\u22122, which is a factor of 1.7 greater than that calculated for 2000. Two further aviation growth scenarios out to 2050 were derived mirroring the IPCC A1 and B2 scenarios with two NOx technology variants (t1 and t2). The aviation RF for the 2050 A1t1 scenario of 194 mW m\u22122 represents an increase of a factor of 4.0 over 2000, and the value for the 2050 B2t1 scenario of 154 mW m\u22122 is an increase of a factor of 3.2 over 2000. Both scenarios assume improvements of technology that were anticipated previously by IPCC (1999). AIC RFs for all the 2020 forecast and 2050 scenarios were scaled by fuel usage from the 2005 AIC RF value but are not included in the RF totals presented here. The methods by which the 2050 RFs have been calculated are simplified, particularly for O3, CH4 and contrail impacts. As such, the results presented here are indicative and should be followed up with a larger-scale international multi-model effort. In the case of AIC, we highlight that no process-based model has yet been presented in the literature and there is an urgent need for such modelling.",

            "text": "A range of options and possibilities for reducing emissions from aviation, focussing mainly on CO2, was considered by IPCC AR4 WGIII (\u2018maximum feasible reductions\u2019). For substantial emissions reductions, new and radical technologies will need to be introduced such as blended wing body aircraft and unducted-propfan engines. There are few prospects at the moment for alternative fuels such as liquid hydrogen to make substantial emissions savings and the utility of using biofuels in the aviation sector remains uncertain, principally because of the stringent requirements over fuel composition for reasons of safety. A limited range of scenarios was examined to estimate what degree of CO2 saving could be made by 2030. The potential savings are limited because of the long-lifetime of new aircraft; for example, the fleet in 2030 will substantially comprise the best of today's technology, which has been delivering diminishing returns in terms of fuel efficiency. All 2030 scenarios resulted in increased emissions in line with the underlying growth of passenger demand ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 times 2002 CO2 emissions. Policies and measures have been difficult to formulate for the aviation sector in relation to CO2; fuel taxation is unpopular with many countries and emissions trading has had only limited proposed implementation. Currently, the only proposal for a legal policy framework that directly addresses targeted reduction of aviation CO2 emissions is that of the EU which intends to incorporate aviation into its wider emissions trading scheme in a phased manner in 2012. Determination of how or if to account for non-CO2 effects of aviation in climate policy remains of importance, not only for realising the full potential for climate change mitigation, but also for the acceptance of any policy by the stakeholder community.",

Note that the confidence interval for \u2018Total NOx\u2019 is due to the assumption that the RFs from O3 and CH4 are 100% correlated; however, in reality, the correlation is likely to be less than 100% but to an unknown degree (see text).
