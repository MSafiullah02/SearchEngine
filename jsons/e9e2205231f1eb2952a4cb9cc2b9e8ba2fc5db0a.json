            "text": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from China in January, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratoryconfirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus-host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses that can infect a wide range of human and animal species. Before December, 2019, six human pathogenic coronaviruses were known. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe acute atypical pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations in both immuno competent and immunocompromised patients. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients and, occasionally, lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts. 1 On Dec 31, 2019, WHO was informed of a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Subsequent investigations identified a novel lineage B betacoronavirus (later named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) with a high degree of genomic similarity with bat coronaviruses. [2] [3] [4] The typical clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or coronavirus disease 2019 , are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and include fever, myalgia, dry cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, and radiological evidence of ground-glass lung opacities compatible with atypical pneumonia. [5] [6] [7] However, important clinical differences between COVID-19 and SARS have been increasingly recognised. For example, diarrhoea is seen much less frequently in patients with COVID-19 (2\u00b70-10\u00b71%) than in those with SARS (20\u00b71%). [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Neurological manifestations such as con fusion are infrequently reported in patients with COVID-19 (9\u00b71%) but are almost absent in patients with SARS. 8 Another apparent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is the speed at which the COVID-19 outbreak is expanding. Within just 2 months, the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases world wide has already exceeded the total number of SARS cases by nearly ten times. The mean basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of COVID-19 has been estimated to be similar to that of SARS (roughly 3\u00b70). 10, 11 However, in the epicentre of outbreak in Hubei province, the R 0 of COVID-19 could be as high as 6\u00b749. 12 Although the COVID-19 pandemic might be related to various geographical and social factors, such as the high population density in Wuhan, the massive population movement before the Spring Festival, and control measures implemented by health authorities during the different phases of the outbreak, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 possesses viral factors that are associated with higher transmissibility than SARS-CoV.",

SARS-CoV-2 replicated more efficiently than did SARS-CoV in human pulmonary (Calu3) cells. By contrast, SARS-CoV (but not SARS-CoV-2) replicated efficiently in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was consistently found to induce less cell damage than SARS-CoV in non-human primate kidney (VeroE6) cells. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficient person-to-person transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), because SARS-CoV-2 has most likely adapted well to humans and, thus, is no longer able to propagate well in bat cells, and SARS-CoV-2 can replicate to high levels without inducing substantial host cell damage. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replicated similarly efficiently in human intestinal (Caco2) and pulmonary cells, but SARS-CoV replicated significantly better in intestinal than pulmonary cells. This difference might account for why diarrhoea has been reported much less frequently in patients with COVID-19 than in those infected with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 (but not SARS-CoV) also modestly replicated in neuronal (U251) cells, highlighting the potential that this virus can cause neurological manifestations (eg, confusion, anosmia, and ageusia) in patients with COVID-19. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. These results would be useful for development of COVID-19 animal models.",

We inoculated the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen on VeroE6 (non-human primate kidney) cells, with and without 0\u00b75 \u03bcg/mL trypsin. We monitored the inoculated cells daily for cytopathic effects by light microscopy, and we collected cell supernatant daily for quantitative RT-PCR to assess the viral load. Substantial cytopathic effects were seen at 72 h postinocula tion (hpi), and we confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 replication by quan titative RT-PCR using specific primers and probes against SARS-CoV-2 (panel). 16 We did whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate using an Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Tech nologies, Oxford, UK) supplemented by Sanger sequencing, as previously described. 4 Sequence com parisons between SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a and clinical isolates are shown in the appendix (pp 1-2). SARS-CoV was a clinical isolate archived at the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. Both SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a (GenBank accession number MT230904) and SARS-CoV GZ50 (AY304495) were propagated and the titre ascertained in VeroE6 cells with plaque assays.

Among these susceptible cell lines, SARS-CoV-2 replication was most robust in Calu3 (pulmonary; p=0\u00b70003) and Caco2 (intestinal; p=0\u00b70009) cells, followed by Huh7 (hepatic; p=0\u00b7012) and 293T (renal; p=0\u00b70080) cells. Furthermore, modest SARS-CoV-2 replication was detected in U251 (neuronal; p=0\u00b7036) cells. In general, the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV, which also showed significant virus replication in Calu3 (p=0\u00b7039), Caco2 (p=0\u00b70009), Huh7 (p=0\u00b70012), and 293T (p=0\u00b70017) cells, but not in U251 cells ( figure 1B) . Although SARS-CoV showed higher replication capacity in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells (>3\u00b75 log difference between Caco2 and Calu3 at 120 hpi; p=0\u00b70098), SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in both Caco2 and Calu3 cells (<0\u00b71 log difference between Caco2 and Calu3 at 120 hpi; p=0\u00b752). These findings were supported by the AUC analysis, which showed that the total virus production in Calu3 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV (p=0\u00b70022), but the total virus production in Caco2 cells infected by SARS-CoV was significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2 (p=0\u00b7015), over the 120 h period ( figure 1C) . The difference in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 and Caco2 cells was further validated by assays to ascertain the median tissue culture infectious dose (appendix p 3). Overall, despite SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV sharing a similar profile of cellular tropism, the two viruses might differ in their capacity to infect or replicate in pulmonary, intestinal, and neuronal cells. Of 16 non-human cell lines tested (table), six were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of figure 2A ). SARS-CoV-2 replicated most robustly in nonhuman primate cells and pig cells, as shown by a 3 log or greater increase in mean viral load over a period of 120 h in VeroE6, FRhK4, and PK-15 cells. Similar to the human cell tropism profile, the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in non-human cells largely matched that of SARS-CoV, which was also capable of infecting and replicating in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells ( figure 2B) . Importantly, SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, could replicate in Rhinolophus sinicus primary bat kidney cells (RSK; p=0\u00b7048). With the recombinant human ACE2 protein blocking assay, we confirmed that, similar to SARS-CoV, infection of SARS-CoV-2 was dependent on ACE2 (appendix p 4).",

Although immunofluorescent antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity than do RT-PCR assays, this non-labour-intensive diagnostic could be considered as a screening test in laboratories without the resources and expertise for RT-PCR assays for COVID-19. Finally, our data show that among the 25 cell lines assessed, cytopathic effects were only seen in VeroE6 and FRhK4 cells after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation for up to 120 hpi. These findings are important for optimisation of antiviral assays based on cell protection assessment, because cell lines without obvious cytopathic effects might lead to overestimation of cell viability and drug efficacy.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, cell line tropism might not fully represent how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and affects human organs in the physiological state. Thus, our cell line susceptibility results and the clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 might not completely accord. It is essential to further characterise virus-host interactions in more physiological models, such as ex-vivo human organ tissue and human organoids from patients of different ages, sexes, and with underlying diseases. Nevertheless, findings in cell line susceptibility studies of MERS-CoV were highly corroborative with those seen in patients with MERS. 13 Second, for all our experiments, we used one viral isolate that was highly homologous to other reported SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Isolates with additional amino acid mutations, particularly involving the receptor binding domain, should be studied to identify viral factors that might affect virus entry to host cells and virus replication kinetics. Finally, the viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in other human cell lines (eg, cardiomyocytes) and animal cell lines should be assessed to investigate virus-induced damage in cardiac cells and potential animal reservoirs.",
