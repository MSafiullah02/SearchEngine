The primer combinations were: oligonucleotide pair 2Bp/4Bm, which is in a region of gene 1 that is moderately conserved among all species of coronavirus (1); and UTR11-/UTR41+, which are in a highly conserved part of the 3 untranslated region of avian coronaviruses related to infectious bronchitis virus (2). The gene 1 primer pair enabled the detection of a new coronavirus in a green-cheeked Amazon parrot (Amazon viridigenalis Cassin). In this chapter we describe the use of these oligonucleotides in a one-step (single-tube) RT-PCR, and describe the procedure that we used to extract RNA from turkey feces.",

Recently, a coronavirus in quail has been shown to have an S1 sequence with about 80% identity with that of TCoV (7). In gene 1, which encodes RNA replication functions, there are sequences with moderately high nucleotide identity among all known coronaviruses, which has led to the design of oligonucleotide combinations for the detection of all known coronaviruses-pancoronavirus primers (see, e.g., (1) and other chapters in this book). Herein we demonstrate the utility of the Stephensen primers for the detection of a coronavirus in parrots (8).",

Incubate microfuge tube containing nuclease-free water and bead on ice for 5 min, ensuring that the beads are resuspended in the water. The amount of water added depends on the volumes of RNA and primers; the final volume, after addition of oligonucleotide primers (see next step) should be 50 l. 3. To this add 2 l forward primer (1 pmol/l) and 2 l reverse primer (1 pmol/l) and 1 to 10 l of RNA (see Note 10). Reminder: upon addition of the primers and template, total reaction volume should be 50 l. 4. Add a 50 l mineral oil overlay to the microfuge tube while it is still on ice before placing the tubes into PCR thermocycler (see Note 11). The RT-PCR is performed in a thermocycler with a heated lid using the following program: 42 \u2022 C for 30 min and 95 \u2022 C for 5 min for the reverse transcriptase step. First-strand cDNA generated with these beads is used as a direct template for PCR. The amplification step is denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 1 min, primer annealing at the desired temperature for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 \u2022 C for 3 min. These cycles are repeated 35 times, with a final step of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Use 50 \u2022 C for the gene 1 oligonucleotide combination 2Bp/4Bm, and 48 \u2022 C for 3 UTR oligonucleotide combination UTR11-/UTR41+.

            "text": "2. When RNA extraction or RT-PCR is being carried out in a laboratory on a routine basis it is important to put safeguards in place to prevent the detection of false positives or false negatives, which may occur owing to several sources of crosscontamination. For example, it is advisable to have separate areas for the handling of PCR reagents and areas in which the RT-PCR is set up. If possible each step of the process should be carried out in a separate room, e.g., one area for the storage of reaction components, one area for the reaction to be set up, another area where the reaction tube will be opened after PCR has been carried out, and another for the corresponding sequencing reactions. 3. The surfaces of the bench at which RNA extraction or RT-PCR is carried out should be prepared by cleaning with an RNAse inhibitor spray and 70% ethanol solution. 4. Filter tips should be used for all pipettes. If available, separate sets of pipettes should be used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR. The design of the experiment should incorporate positive and negative controls. 5. Freeze feces for storage. For subsequent sampling, simply scrape frozen feces off the surface; there is no need to thaw the feces. 6. We found that sterile ice-cream sticks (wooden birch sticks) were useful for this purpose, as they are cheap and disposable. 7. Feces contain materials that may adversely affect enzyme function or nucleic acid integrity. Although avian feces have a different composition from that of mammals, the QIAamp DNA stool kit of Qiagen was certainly effective when used with turkey and chicken feces. 8. When opening and closing microfuge tubes during RNA extraction, be careful of any aerosol or droplets spraying and contaminating work surfaces or other samples. 9. This is a one-step RT-PCR reaction to reduce the amount of handling required. In our laboratory it has been used to amplify RT-PCR products of between 200 bp and 2.5 kb in length. 10. We found that 2 l of RNA was usually sufficient. However, if a very small amount of virus is suspected within fecal samples, up to 10 l of RNA extracted from feces can be added without deleterious effect. 11. In our experience, better amplification of RNA products is obtained when mineral oil is added to the reaction, regardless of whether or not a thermocycler, with or without, a hot lid is used. 12. Even the conserved, 3 -terminal part of the 3 UTR of group 3 avian coronaviruses exhibits some variation. It is likely that oligonucleotides UTR11-and UTR41+ will require modification to increase their universality for group 3 coronaviruses. For example, we modified our initial versions of these primers [UTR1and UTR4+ (12)] to the current UTR11-and UTR41+ as more IBV sequences became available. We did this by moving the position of the oligonucleotides very slightly to avoid variation at the extreme 3 -end of the oligonucleotides. The data of Jonassen et al. (9) for group 3 coronaviruses in pigeon, mallard duck, and greylag goose suggests that our UTR11-and UTR41+ primers should be modified slightly to increase the likelihood of them working with coronaviruses in a greater number of species. Modification might well include degeneracy, especially with respect to the 3 -most nucleotide.",
