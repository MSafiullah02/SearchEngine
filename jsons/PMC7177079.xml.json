            "text": "The respiratory tract plays a vital role in respiratory physiology by enabling gas exchange at the alveolar/capillary membrane. As such, the airways are in continuous contact with the airborne particulate matter, and the respiratory epithelium is colonized by several species of virus, bacteria, and fungi [1]. Nonetheless, infection and disease progression is prevented by the innate pulmonary defense mechanisms [1]. While the continuous functioning of the immune system is necessary to maintain respiratory barrier integrity against microbes, it is also regulated to prevent excessive tissue damage and inflammation. Several cytokines and chemokines shape the magnitude and quality of immune responses occurring at the lungs [2]. Specifically, chemokines regulate the cellular composition of mucosal tissue by inducing the migration of leukocytes and other non-immune cells expressing their cognate receptors [3]. Twenty three chemokine receptor subsets have been identified in humans and are broadly classified into atypical chemokine receptors (n = 4) or the G protein\u2013coupled chemotactic chemokine receptors (n = 19) [4,5]. Although certain chemokine-receptor pairs are highly specific and unique (such as CXCR6/CXCL16), often several chemokine/receptor pairs can be formed, each one with variable specificity depending on the cellular targets induced to migrate [3]. Depending on the differential receptor expression and usage, as well as the potential agonism or antagonism initiated by the chemokine-receptor binding, the functions observed in vivo for chemokines acting at the same G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPR) might vary [6]. The binding of chemokines to their receptors triggers a chain of molecular events including the dissociation of GTP-bound G\u03b1i subunits from G\u03b2/\u03b3 heterodimers, which initiates calcium release from the endoplasmic-reticulum reservoirs and further activation of calcium-dependent signaling. These events lead to the downstream initiation of JAK/STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways which eventually govern the functional responses induced by these chemokines [7,8].",

Members of the CXC family can be subdivided based on the presence or absence of the triad glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR) preceding the CXC sequence as ELR-positive or ELR-negative [10]. Besides this structural classification, chemokines are also grouped as \u201chomeostatic\u201d or \u201cinflammatory\u201d based on their physiological properties. Additionally, a third group of \u201cdual\u201d chemokines are recognized which includes those that have overlapping functions [11]. While most of the chemokines have been functionally designated into one of the above-mentioned categories, some chemokines such as CCL16, CXCL15 and CXCL17 are yet to be assigned a specific functional role.",

While chemokines are active in their monomeric form, they also form homo- or heterodimers with one or more chemokine species. The resultant chemokine-receptor interactome formed play pivotal roles in processes like embryogenesis, wound healing, vascularization, and pathogen clearance which are beneficial to the host. However, chemokines can also participate in the pathological mechanisms that drive autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and cancer [13]. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of their implications in clinically relevant pulmonary disorders [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. Hence, these mediators represent promising new targets for translational research, as they could be manipulated to block chemokine/receptor axes implicated in pathological conditions or harnessed in order to promote beneficial chemokine-mediated mechanisms. Despite remarkable advances, some gaps in the understanding of chemokine/receptor networks have delayed their therapeutic use in humans, especially of those chemokines recently discovered whose functions have not been fully characterized such as CXCL17.",

CXCL17 is produced along the airways both at steady state and induced under inflammatory conditions [19,20], suggesting a role in local immune responses at the respiratory system. Current attempts to characterize the biology of CXCL17 have revealed its involvement in maintenance of homeostasis and cellular composition at different epithelial surfaces. Moreover, recent studies show that CXCL17 is involved in several human health and disease playing either a protective or pathologic role, respectively.

Mouse and human immature versions of CXCL17 share 71 % amino acid sequence identity [19,20]. Moreover, the pattern of CXCL17 expression is similar in mucosal tissues of both human and murine species [[22], [23], [24]]. These precursor proteins have six cysteine residues between Leu24 to Leu119, but only four of them (located among Phe64 to Leu119) participate in the building of the CXC motif. Post-translational cleavage removes a 22 amino acids sequence containing two cysteine residues from the amino-terminal domain, which result in a mature protein of 11,418 Da in humans and 11,164 Da in mice [19,20,23]. This maturation process leads to attainment of the full functional capacity of CXCL17, as the four-cysteine mature peptide has a two-fold increase in chemoattractant activity to recruit human THP-1 monocytes and mouse J774 macrophages in vitro, compared with the six-cysteine pro-peptide [23]. Therefore, the amino-terminal sequence may affect the affinity during the receptor binding process, although other functions of this cleaved fraction remain to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The identity of the CXCL17 receptor is somewhat controversial. This chemokine does not have affinity for CCR2, CCR5, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR7 [25]. So far, it has been described that CXCL17 induces a dose-dependent calcium flux in pro B-cell line Ba/F3 cells transfected with GPR35 [25]. However, silencing or antagonism of GPR35 does not inhibit migration of THP-1 and primary human monocytes in responses to a CXCL17 gradient [26,27]. These findings suggest that GPR35 lacks a selective ligand [28], thereby excluding its sole responsibility for CXCL17 activity and raising the possibility of the presence of another as yet unidentified receptor [26]. Despite this, it is now established that CXCL17-induced cell migration is inhibited by Pertussis toxin (PTX) which reduces the affinity of GPR35 for its agonist via ADP ribosylation of G\u03b1i/o heterotrimeric proteins and resultant uncoupling of the GPCR from the G proteins [22,29,30]. Furthermore, there is evidence showing that intracellular signals triggered by the attachment of CXCL17 to its receptor involves the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPKs pathways [23]. Therefore, most published studies support the fact that CXCL17 receptor is a GPCR with seven transmembrane domains such as GPR35.",

CXCL17 expression in healthy human tissues and cell lines showed its basal production in fetal lung samples, as well as in adult trachea, epithelium of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar cells [19,20]. Also, its expression is detected in the stomach, small intestine and colon, specifically within the lining epithelium at the luminal surface of epithelial cells, suggesting an active process of secretion of this chemokine into the airways and intestinal lumen, respectively [19,24]. Interestingly, the distribution of CXCL17 is almost restricted to the epithelial barriers that cover the lumen of several hollow organs and secretory conducts, in contrast with other mucosal chemokines, such as CXCL14 and CCL25, which can also be found within the solid parenchyma of different tissues at steady state [[31], [32], [33]]. Notably, lungs and airways also show significant CXCL17 expression in various species of mammals including humans, cattle, sheep, mice and rats, thus supporting a potential role of this chemokine in the physiology of the respiratory epithelium. The tissue expression profile of CXCL17 in human and murine species has been previously described [19,20,23,24,29,34,35], and is summarized in Table 1\n.",

Other cells may amplify CXCL17 signaling from the epithelium, such as endothelial cells which are also producers of CXCL17 [24], suggesting that this chemokine facilitates the exit of APCs from the vasculature.

Although the ELR motif has not been described in CXCL17, functionally it behaves as a member of the group of angiogenic factors [20,23,38]. In fact, several human endothelial cell lines such as human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC), sephranose vascular endothelial cells (SPVEC) and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) express higher levels of CXCL17 during proliferation or tube formation [20]. HUVEC cells transfected with CXCL17 increase their expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiopoietin-2 (ang-2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (uPAR) [20]. Also, treatment of THP-1 monocytes with mature CXCL17 enhances their ability to produce VEGF-A [23]. Additionally, expression of CXCL17 is co-regulated with other proangiogenic molecules as IL-8, GRO-1 and VEGF in samples from lung, breast and esophageal cancers [20]. Finally, CXCL17 is one of the most important genes mutated within specific genetic loci of stroke susceptibility in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, a murine model of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage suggesting a potential participation of this chemokine in the maintenance of vascular structure [38].",

This increase was also observed in primary gastric cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and alcohol [23], confirming that pro-inflammatory signals induce CXCL17 production and demonstrating that other cell types may also become reservoirs of this protein under certain inflammatory conditions. The cellular subsets, receptors and signaling agents responsible for exacerbated CXCL17 production at the mucosal surfaces is yet to be fully understood. However, there is some evidence of post-transcriptional regulation of CXCL17 expression with recent data indicating that CXCL17 is a target of miR-221-3p, as the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of CXCL17 gene contains sequences that match with the sequence of has-miR-221-3p.

Currently there is a concise body of evidence suggesting that CXCL17 is an anti-inflammatory mediator in conditions such as experimental psoriasis in mice, autoimmune diseases and respiratory afflictions in humans [35,45,46]. Indeed, in mice with experimental psoriasis, the local administration of CXCL17 has been related to a reduced infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the skin, reduced T cell responses as well as lower local levels of IL-17A, IL-22, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IL-23, but increased expression of IL-10 and Foxp3 [45]. These changes are also associated with recruitment of myeloid-derived stem cells (MDSCs) to the sites of CXCL17 exposure, which subsequently attract T regulatory (Treg) cells in a CCL4- and CCL5-dependent way [45]. Moreover, in vitro assays have shown that the CXCL17 treatment also attenuates the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages [23]. Finally, the genetic knockdown of CXCL17 in mice has been recently associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), suggesting that deficiencies in CXCL17 signaling are important for the development and maintenance of auto-tolerance [35]. Collectively, these data strengthen the notion that CXCL17 has a potent anti-inflammatory role in autoimmune diseases.",

In this context, the role of CXCL17 in the immunity to infection remains under investigation. Recently, it was observed that expression of CXCL17 was highly increased in the duodenum of humans with acute cholera, but the nature of its contribution to the defense against Vibrio cholerae was undetermined [56]. Likewise, in a mouse model of HSV-1 infection, the inoculation of the virus enhanced CXCL17 production at the vaginal mucosa of mice [44]. Concurrently, mice deficient in CXCL17 were more susceptible to HSV-1, as they could not control viral replication nor virus dissemination to the dorsal ganglia. These disease phenotypes were associated with decreased proportion of GPR35-expressing antigen-specific memory CD8+T cells within the vaginal tissue of these animals [44]. The broad-spectrum bactericidal activity of CXCL17 against bacteria associated with respiratory infections indicates the involvement of this chemokine in lung defense. However, in some bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), CXCL17 gene expression was upregulated among ILC3 cells isolated from lung tissues of patients with active disease, suggesting that this chemokine may participate in the early recruitment of myeloid cells to the lung parenchyma during mycobacterial infection [57]. Together, these observations further stress the dual role played by this chemokine in infectious diseases.",

This hypothesis is partially supported by observations about increased expression of CXCL17 and GPR35 in breast cancer clinical samples [61].

Formation of new blood vessels within tumors is a pivotal event that supports nutrient supply, cancer progression and better access to blood vessels enabling cancer cells to metastasize [70]. CXCL17 is co-regulated with VEGF in clinical samples from individuals with cancer [20]. Secondly, fibroblast cell lines and colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1, SW620) expressing CXCL17 form tumors with increased vasculature and abundant blood supply when injected into immunodeficient mice [22]. Some of these tumors were characterized by the infiltration of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells that migrate in response to CXCL17 gradients and participate in the promotion of tumor formation and vascularization [22]. Therefore, these data suggest that CXCL17 may promote tumor vascularization both directly acting on local vascular niches or indirectly via recruitment of cell populations that support angiogenesis.",

For instance, in tissue samples from humans with HCC and colon cancer, a high expression of CXCL17 was associated with the presence of CD68+ cells, the proportion of which correlates with survival [60,62]. Also, CXCL17 is a known recruiter of MDSC and Treg cells [45], and it is already established that MDSC can synergize with Treg cells to prevent tumor immunity and promote tumor progression [71]. In contrast there is currently insufficient evidence to support a role for CXCL17-mediated anti-tumoral immune responses. Interestingly, CXCL17 mediate the infiltration of immature myeloid DCs into pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas and promotes rendering of the tumor susceptible to cytotoxic T cell mediated cytolysis [29]. Also, expression of CXCL17 is lost progressively as pancreatic tumors become more malignant [29], supporting a protective effect during early stages of pancreatic cancer development. However, whether such an anti-tumor role for CXCL17 would extend to other cancer subtypes would be a necessary avenue for future research.",

Although, there is currently no evidence for the chemotactic activity of CXCL17 on fibroblasts or their precursors, it is possible that CXCL17 could support the local proliferation of lung fibroblasts. However, this line of reasoning is also questionable as although transfection of the CXCL17 gene into embryonic mouse fibroblast cell lines promotes formation of tumors, it is not mediated by an improvement of the proliferative capacity of the fibroblasts [22]. Nevertheless, investigation of the potential induction of cell proliferation mediated by CXCL17 needs to be performed using human primary lung fibroblasts or human lung fibroblasts cell lines to definitively rule out this mechanism. If subsequent studies confirm a role for CXCL17 in pathogenesis of IPF, then this chemokine would constitute a novel target to focus the development of novel therapeutic approaches against this devastating disease.",

            "text": "Recently, the participation of CXCL17 in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation responsible of type 2 asthma has been established by assessing the expression of CXCL17 in bronchial brushing samples from asthmatic patients, who showed higher transcripts of this chemokine compared to healthy controls [46]. Such increased expression was restricted to the bronchial epithelium. Furthermore, the mechanism was evaluated in vitro in a bronchial cell line, wherein overexpression of CXCL17 gene inhibited the production of CCL24, CCL26 and epithelial periostin (POSTN; all molecules involved in recruitment of eosinophils) in response to exogenous stimulation with IL-13. Also, an inverse correlation between CXCL17 transcript levels and miR-221 was observed while overregulation of miR-221 increased production of CCL24, CCL26, POSTN, as well as lung eosinophilic inflammation by suppressing CXCL17 expression [46]. This suggests an anti-inflammatory role of CXCL17 in asthma, as CCL26 and CCL24 are key players in eosinophilic recruitment, proliferation and airway remodeling in asthma [84,85], while miR-221 participates in airway epithelial cell injury via sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) [86]. Thus, the enhanced production of CXCL17 at respiratory epithelium in asthmatic individuals might reflect a compensatory effort to counteract inflammation of the airways which makes this chemokine a potential target for immunotherapeutic development. Nonetheless, it is also possible that CXCL17 mediates contrasting roles during different stages of asthma, but this notion should be evaluated in future investigations. Additionally, this feature of increased CXCL17 in asthmatic individuals makes it a potential diagnostic biomarker, but targeted studies validating this are yet to be conducted. Finally, findings described here should prompt clinical researchers to look for a potential role of CXCL17 in other allergic respiratory diseases such as rhinitis, as well as in pulmonary disorders caused by altered infiltration of eosinophils, as is the case of eosinophilic interstitial lung disease.",

As such, the possibility for a potential role for this chemokine in respiratory infections is warranted. Indeed, CXCL17 along with other chemokines such as CXCL1, 8, 10, 11 and 16 has been found to be highly expressed in human bronchial epithelial, human tracheobronchial epithelial and A549 cells infected with influenza A/H3N2 virus but reduced in these cells infected with A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 strains [87]. Avian influenza A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 strains are more virulent due to acquired genetic properties contributing to a faster replication rate and rate of infection compared to seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains [88,89]. Coincidentally, in an as yet unpublished study conducted in Mexico City during the 2018\u20132019 Flu season, it was found that the levels of CXCL17 were significantly increased in the sera of patients suffering from severe pneumonia caused by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus (Dr. Joaquin Zuniga, unpublished data). Interestingly, patients with higher levels of CXCL17 exhibited a trend for decreased disease severity and better survival indicating an enhanced host response to thwart progressing infection. However, further studies deconvoluting the role of CXCL17 and influenza would be needed to fully ascertain this link (Dr. Joaquin Zuniga, unpublished data).",

One such study assessed the significantly altered genes induced in vitro in Calu-3 (2B-4) human lung epithelial cells infected with the virulent wild-type icSARS-COV or the attenuated mutant strains, icSARSExoNI [mutation in exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) governing the activity of guanine-N7-methyltransferase involved in infection and pathogenesis)] and icSARS dNSP16 (mutations in a 12 conserved 2\u2032O methyltransferase which impacts immune responses and pathogenesis) [90,91]. The data from this study indicates that CXCL17 expression is significantly upregulated in cells infected with the attenuated mutant strain, icSARS dNSP16 in comparison with the virulent WT SARS-COV strain [92] indicating that virulent strains with intact 2\u2032O methyltransferase maybe avoiding induction of strong innate immune responses in host cells.",

            "text": "Lung cancer leads the list of killer neoplasia worldwide [93]. Currently, there is an urgent necessity to identify novel molecules implicated in cancer biology that can fulfill the role as biomarkers and therapeutic targets to stop the burden caused by different histological subtypes of lung cancer. In this regard, the fact that expression of CXCL17 has been observed in human tissue samples from patients with NSCLC arouses the interest of exploring the possible participation of this chemokine in molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer [22]. For this, studies comparing the concentration of CXCL17 between biological samples (BAL, bronchial brushing, sputum, biopsy specimens, plasma) from humans with lung cancer and healthy controls would be needed. Next, investigations looking for correlation between levels of this chemokine and clinical parameters such as risk of mortality, recurrence after treatment and incidence of metastasis, will reveal the pro- or anti-tumorigenic features of CXCL17 activity in the context of lung cancer. Furthermore, animal models using knockout mice, as well as genetic manipulation of CXCL17 expression in lung cancer cell lines will reveal the underlying mechanisms including promotion of cellular proliferation, escape from apoptosis, metastasis, regulation of anti-tumoral immune responses, and support of angiogenesis. This latter mechanism may deserve particular consideration since angiogenic pathways play a remarkable role in the promotion of tumor growth in NSCLC [94]. Currently, treatment with anti-angiogenic factors such as bevacizumab, an inhibitor of VEGF, is the main strategy for the management of advanced NSCLC [95]. However, resistance to bevacizumab may appear in some patients due to the activation of other angiogenic pathways different from VEGF signaling. These compensatory mechanisms include FGF signaling [96], a pro-angiogenic factor that is regulated by CXCL17 [20]. Therefore, targeting CXCL17 could be a good strategy to improve efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in lung cancer.",

Rise in the prevalence of drug resistant bacteria contributes to morbidity and mortality of this infectious lung diseases [97]. Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) have gained attention as potential therapeutic agents [98], since most of them possess a broad spectrum activity and less risk of resistance development. Administration of mixtures of AMPs and exogenous surfactants is an innovative strategy under investigation to deliver molecules with antimicrobial activity directly into the respiratory tract [99,100]. CXCL17 has a potent bactericidal activity over bacterial strains causative of respiratory infections that tend to develop resistance to antibiotics, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [24]. Therefore, CXCL17 may represent a novel candidate for this therapeutic approach. Nonetheless, further demonstration of the bactericidal activity of this chemokine in vivo is necessary. Moreover, complete characterization of the structural basis of its antimicrobial properties is required to isolate the peptide sequence responsible of such activity and limit collateral damages resulting from excessive CXCL17 signaling.",

The functions of CXCL17 are illustrated by exemplifying its possible participation in the maintenance of homeostasis of the respiratory tract. (a) CXCL17 expression is restricted to the lining epithelium of the airways and distant alveoli. (b) CXCL17 has a potent bactericidal activity over pathogenic bacterial strains, but not against commensal bacteria, suggesting a role in shaping the composition of bacterial community residing at different epithelial surfaces. In addition, CXCL17 controls the recruitment of certain subsets of myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages across the endothelium into the epithelium. (c) During mucosal infections, production of CXCL17 may increase to counteract bacterial replication by its direct antimicrobial activity, or via regulating the infiltration of myeloid cells into the infected epithelium. (d) CXCL17 also plays an anti-inflammatory role, as illustrated in the case of eosinophilic inflammation of the airways elicited by allergens in patients with type 2 asthma. In these settings, CXCL17 inhibits the production of chemokines important for the recruitment of eosinophils, such as CCL24 and CCL26.
