For instance, with inactivated vaccines, the consensus derived from several studies is that an HI antibody level of 1:40 against HA should be considered protective [30]. However, this level is only 50%\u201370% protective so this correlate of protection should be regarded as relative rather than absolute [30]. ",

Humoral immune responses raised against influenza viruses or related vaccines are mediated by several factors, such as age, the simultaneous presence of other diseases and the contemporaneous use of medicines that may affect immune function. Several studies have been conducted on the immune response to influenza vaccines and conflicting results were obtained. Some show that vaccination induces a lower HI antibody response in elderly compared to young recipients, while others report no discrepancy between age brackets or indeed report a contrary result. Protective immune indicators against influenza in at-risk groups must yet be defined since, even in this case, some studies have reported a reduced humoral response in risk groups, while other studies have shown that the humoral response is comparable to healthy control subjects [26].",

However, according to Quin, a surrogate may or may not be considered as a causal agent of protection, whereas Plotkin considers a surrogate of protection to be an immunological measurement performed when unable to ascertain a true correlate but stresses that there is no direct causality assumed with a surrogate [29]. Another relevant concept defines surrogates of protection as correlates able to predict the level of protective efficacy of a vaccine by comparing immunological measurements of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals [34].

            "text": "The HI assay is based on the ability of antibodies, if present in the serum, to prevent agglutination between erythrocytes and viral haemmaglutinin [36]. The antibody titre is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution showing complete inhibition using 4 HAU units/25 \u00b5L or 8 HAU units/50 \u00b5L [8,37]. The starting dilution is generally 1:10 and the lower limit of a detectable antibody titre is 10. When the titre of antisera is under a detectable threshold, due to a low or non-existent amount of antibodies, this is conventionally expressed as 5, half the lowest detection threshold [38]. As previously mentioned, an antibody titre of 40 is generally considered as a protective threshold level, beyond which there is a 50% or greater reduction in the possibility of contracting influenza infection [11,39]. An HI titre equal to or greater than 40 is used as an immunological correlate of protection and is regarded as the best currently available parameter for predicting protection from natural infection, according to FDA guidelines for pandemic influenza vaccines [40]. The problem raised by Black et al. [41], however, is that this correlate is well defined in adults but not in children although it also applies to serology of samples from this age group. Children show a reduced capacity for cellular immunity and have little to no previous exposure to either influenza or vaccination. This situation necessitates the definition of a protective correlate specific to this category. More importantly, previous exposure to the influenza virus or vaccination can play a crucial role in reaching the protective threshold level in adults. In fact, even if all those who receive the vaccine are seroprotected (a subject is defined as seroprotected if the antibody level is above a certain cut-off [38]), this result may not correspond to a 50% vaccine-induced reduction of risk of influenza infection, due to the presence of protective antibodies in some subjects prior to vaccine administration. Therefore, an HI titre of 40 is not a threshold of protection induced by the vaccine but protection induced by antibodies in general [42]. This is the reason why, in vaccine assessment, seroprotection is complemented by the two further criteria, seroconversion and mean geometric increase which help discriminate high antibody titres prior to vaccination.",

[41] conducted a study in children aged between 6 and 72 months who had not previously been vaccinated in order to evaluate the relationship between HI antibody titre and clinical protection from influenza illness. The subjects were divided into 3 groups and each received two doses, one month apart, of either an MF59 Adjuvanted Trivalent Inactivated influenza Vaccine (ATIV, Fluad\u00ae, Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy), a subunit Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) or a saline placebo. Clinical cases for influenza like illness were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza. For the recipients of the adjuvanted vaccine, results confirmed that a cut-off of 1:110 measured 21 days after the second vaccine dose could be used as a marker of 50% protection in the juvenile sample population. Titres of 1:215, 1:330 and 1:629 correspond to protection levels of 70%, 80% and 90% respectively (Table 2). Importantly, similar results could not be achieved in the TIV vaccine group. Therefore, it is evident that a higher HI titre is required in na\u00efve subjects compared to those with a previous history of influenza infection in which other protective factors may come into play. A further consideration could be to assess whether the HI assay is indeed the best option to evaluate influenza vaccines for children [43].",

In this instance, the use of influenza HA pseudotypes as surrogates for wild-type virus is a safer alternative, that may also have increased throughput capability and ease of standardization benefits (see Section 5). Other limitations of the VN assay include extensive training requirements for laboratory personnel, issues with throughput/simultaneous screening of large panels of sera and importantly, problems with standardising cell preparations, virus inoculations and incubation times [15,49]. Incidentally, inter-laboratory variation is significant with VN assays due to the lack of common reference protocols, discrepancies with assay endpoint determination and limited knowledge of correlates of protection. Currently, no protective correlates have been defined for VN in animal or human models, and due to the assay\u2019s variability, a VN titre equivalent to an HI titre of 40 is highly specific for each antigen-laboratory combination and therefore cannot be generalized [57].",

The core virus has deletions in its genome making it replication-deficient (allowing it to be used under BSL1/2 containment), and harbours a reporter transgene (e.g., luciferase or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)). The envelope glycoprotein permits entry into susceptible target assay cells (e.g., Human Embryonic Kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T)/MDCK) via interaction with sialic acid. During target cell transduction, the pseudotype virus genome becomes integrated into the cell genome, resulting in reporter gene expression.

Figure 3 below shows a schematic representation of the production and assay of influenza HA pseudotyped retroviruses. Pseudotype production of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) strains (which have a polybasic cleavage site in the HA) routinely involves the transfection of three plasmids into 293T producer cells: retroviral gag-pol plasmid, HA-expressing plasmid, and retroviral vector plasmid incorporating the reporter gene. Additionally, for the production of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) strains (single arginine at cleavage site), an additional plasmid expressing a protease (either Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 ((TMPRSS2) or Human Airway Trypsin-like Protease (HAT)) is necessary [70,71].",

This has recently been successfully achieved with avian influenza strains H5 and H7 to study the immunogenicity of a bivalent H5/H7 chicken vaccine [73]. When evaluating sera for the presence and magnitude of neutralizing antibodies directed against two viruses (H1 and H3 for seasonal, H5 and H7 for pandemic, for example), there are distinct advantages to the use of a multiplex assay rather than individual subtype assays, which are in routine usage. In a multiplex format, inter-assay variability is likely to be reduced, since only a single serum dilution series needs to be performed and the same preparation of target cells (e.g. MDCK) is used for the two viruses. Also, the antibody response to one virus may serve as an internal \u201csero-standard\u201d for the antibody response to the second virus and vice versa, as two separate luciferase reporters (firefly and renilla) are employed for this assay [73]. A pseudotype-based assay is more readily amenable to high-throughput processing of large serum panels, which will enable effective and informative larger-scale studies to be carried out. There are also beneficial safety and financial implications to the use of this assay, since antibody responses against two viruses are performed on the same serum samples with the entire process performed outside of high BSL facilities, which by their nature are expensive to maintain and require a high level of user training. The pseudotype-based neutralization assay is both \u201cserum-sparing\u201d and \u201cantigen-sparing\u201d as only 2\u20135 \u00b5L of serum is required per assay compared with the significantly larger volume required for traditionally employed influenza serology assays, and very small volumes of pseudotype virus (<1 \u00b5L virus/well) are required. It is therefore possible to measure antibody responses against large panels of sera more rapidly and more accurately than using traditional influenza serology assays (HI, VN, SRH). ",

            "text": "Particular interest should be paid also to the potential of pseudotype neutralization assays to study antigenic evolution of influenza viruses. The continuous rapid evolution of influenza viruses, driven by error-prone replication and increasingly by immune pressure, significantly influences the sensitivity of available serological assays for this virus. It can also limit the efficacy of human and avian influenza vaccines and the susceptibility of these viruses to anti-viral drugs, via the emergence of drug resistance. As substitution rates are significantly higher in influenza HA and NA genes compared with internal genes, retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes bearing HA and NA envelope glycoproteins devolved from the rest of the virus are ideal tools to monitor the effects of antigenic drift on serological outcomes, and can be used for accurate sequence-directed, highly sensitive, low-containment assays for measuring antibody responses against influenza HA. It is relatively straightforward to update the pseudotype-based HA neutralization assay to measure responses against newly emerging influenza viruses [69,71,74,78,81]. Upon availability of the viral RNA/cDNA, HA/NA genes can be sequenced, readily PCR-amplified and cloned, or custom synthesized, and retroviral pseudotypes prepared for use in neutralization assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the HA can subsequently be used to \u201cfine-tune\u201d the neutralization assay in order to track the evolutionary progression of the circulating virus at the genetic, and more importantly for serology, at the antigenic level. Therefore, these assays can be continually and easily updated to measure the immunogenicity of current and new vaccines and therapeutics, and for sero-surveillance studies in new outbreak locations.",

More specifically, pseudotype-based assays have been shown to be highly efficient for the measurement of broadly neutralizing antibodies directed against the HA2 stalk of influenza, making them ideal serological tools for the study of cross-reactive responses against multiple influenza subtypes with pandemic potential [81,83,84]. The microneutralization assay can also measure HA2 stalk responses, albeit with lower sensitivity. This is likely due to the fact that accessibility to the target epitope is limited by the tight packing of HA molecules in wild-type viruses as compared with pseudotype viruses [75]. The HI assay does not measure any HA2 antibodies. This underscores the importance of conducting comparative serological investigations to more accurately dissect the antibody response against novel vaccines and for sero-epidemiological studies, as each assay measures different (but occasionally overlapping) antibody responses [69,74,85].

SRH is inexpensive, rapid, reliable, reproducible and the quantitative, unbiased results are available after an overnight incubation [89,91,98,99,100,101]. Other significant advantages to the SRH assay include the ability to simultaneously and rapidly test a large number of samples without pre-treatment (excluding complement inactivation), and the requirement for only a small volume of sera [93].

The required amount of virus for this assay is low and therefore it should be possible to carry out the assay with virus prepared in eggs, without necessitating a virus concentration step. Its characteristics make it particularly appropriate for predicting vaccine efficacy and may be extremely useful in establishing the immunogenicity of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines [121].",

This study showed that individuals who had pre-epidemic antibodies against NA had a lower rate of influenza than those who lacked existing anti-NA antibodies.
