Now imagine a slightly easier scale problem: you are a virus that has just got into a cell and you want to get to your site of replication, which may well be in the nucleus (Fig. 1\n). Finally, if you manage to replicate, your progeny will later have the reverse problem, that is to find a way to get out of the host. How do you do it? Easy, you use the transport system of the cell and hop on the cytoskeleton \u2014 but is it as easy as catching the bus or tube?",

In addition, in vitro experiments with purified viral preparations demonstrated that some virus particles can interact with microtubules [4], [5], [6], [7]. It was also widely recognized that virus infection often resulted in disruption of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in [8], [9], [10]). However, for many years these initial, tantalising observations were not followed up and the functional role or the molecular basis of these interactions and disruptions remained largely a mystery. Studies with viruses often tended to focus on understanding viral infection mechanisms, including how entry, replication and assembly occur, but not on how viral particles move within and between cells, although this is an essential aspect of the infection cycle.",

Consequently a number of studies in recent years have begun to use viruses as tools both to dissect cytoskeletal function and to understand the role of the cytoskeleton during infection. This review is organized around the main cellular transport issues for the virus. In addition, we also discuss virus-induced disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

The size of virus particles, which can be as big as 200\u2013400 nm in the case of vaccinia, is such that they are unlikely to move in the viscous cytoplasm by diffusion alone [14\u2022].

In contrast, the microtubule cytoskeleton, with microtubules radiating from the centrosome (which is conveniently situated near the nucleus) to the periphery lends itself to achieving the desired localization. Moving is one thing but going in the right direction is also essential. Microtubules are also organized in a polarized fashion with minus ends at the MTOC (microtubule organising centre) and plus ends at the cell periphery, thus enabling directed movements to take place.",

            "text": "A number of viruses appear to have evolved to use a common retrograde transport mechanism that involves recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule minus-end-directed motor, to move towards the centre of the cell. Studies with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) first implicated both microtubules and a microtubule motor in retrograde viral movements [21], [22], [23]. Further experiments showed that dynein was involved in this transport: dynein colocalises with incoming capsids and depolymerisation of microtubules delays retrograde transport and subsequent viral protein synthesis [24]. More recently, video microscopy, combined with functional disruption of the dynein\u2013dynactin complex, showed that adenovirus serotype 2 (Ad2) uses dynein and microtubules for its retrograde transport to the nucleus [25\u2022\u2022]. Although Ad2 has an overall net movement towards the nucleus at a speed of 2.2\u03bcm/sec, capsids exhibit bidirectional plus- and minus-directed microtubule motility [25\u2022\u2022]. The anterograde plus-end-directed motility is attributed to the action of an unidentified microtubule plus-end-directed motor. Curiously, adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is reported to have only dynein-dependent minus-end microtubule directed movement at the same speed as Ad2 [26]. Consistent with this, microinjection of two different anti-kinesin antibodies had no effect on viral translocation [26]. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether dynein is the only motor involved in this movement because blocking dynein function via antibody microinjection only gave a partial phenotype. So, given the large size of the kinesin superfamily we cannot rule out that this motor is also involved, for movement in either direction, as only two anti-kinesin antibodies were microinjected to block movement.",

Thus, the microtubule cytoskeleton is not essential, but its viral use (or abuse?) certainly facilitates the infection process. This however, raises the question of how do viruses get from the cell periphery to the nucleus in the absence of microtubules. In the case of the adeno-associated virus, actin has been reported to have an unknown role in virus movements toward the nucleus [29]. The only clear example of a role for the actin cytoskeleton in capsid movements towards the nucleus, during the initial establishment of infection, is that of baculovirus [10], [31]. The mechanism by which baculovirus capsids induce so called \u2018actin cables\u2019 remains to be established, but they are similar in appearance to vaccinia-induced actin tails [12].",

            "text": "Pull-down experiments show that the UL34 protein of HSV, which is associated with the incoming viral capsids, interacts with the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein [33]. Furthermore, transiently expressed UL34 partly associates with microtubules [33]. UL25, a minor but essential component of the pseudorabies capsid, may play a similar role, as it colocalises with microtubules when expressed in a non-viral background [27]. Further support for the interaction of herpes virus tegument proteins with microtubules comes from Murata et al. [34] who report that perinuclear accumulation of the HSV tegument proteins, UL41 and UL46, is microtubule dependent [34]. Interaction of capsid proteins with components of the dynein complex is not restricted to herpes virus family members. The cytoplasmic dynein light chain (LC8) was recently isolated as a strong interacting partner of the P phosphoprotein of two lyssaviruses, rabies and Mokola, in a yeast two-hybrid screen [35], [36]. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and the two proteins colocalize in infected cells. Interestingly, in the LC8-binding site of the rabies P phosphoprotein (residues 138\u2013172 [36]), serine 162 is phosphorylated [37]. It is possible that phosphorylation of the P protein regulates interaction with and/or activity of the dynein motor complex. The recruitment of the dynein complex provides an ideal means to achieve retrograde axonal transport in neurons during rabies infections. The fact that LC8 is also associated with the myosin V motor, which is involved in vesicular traffic, indicates that additional actin-based motility of rabies may also take place, especially near the plasma membrane [35].",

            "text": "Vaccinia does not need to get into the nucleus for its replication and assembly as these events take place in the cytoplasm in a perinuclear region in the vicinity of the MTOC [30]. These data, together with the observation that disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton or the dynein\u2013dynactin complex results in dispersed localization of new virus particles [30], would support the notion that either vaccinia moves inwards on microtubules after entry or that newly formed particles are anchored on microtubules in the perinuclear region. Nevertheless, the fact that incoming vaccinia cores begin to disassemble after entry [39] would tend to suggest that, although they may interact with microtubules upon entry [30], they may not actually move. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the dynein\u2013dynactin complex and microtubules are required for virus particle movements or, alternatively, for organization of the intermediate compartment and trans-Golgi network (TGN), which are used for viral wrapping during morphogenesis. It may, however, be virtually impossible to answer this question as both virus particle movements and Golgi membrane organization seem to depend on microtubules. We know that depolymerization of microtubules results in a three-fold reduction in assembly of the first form of the virus, the so called IMV (intracellular mature virus), whereas disruption of the TGN completely inhibits formation of the intracellular enveloped form of vaccinia (IEV) [30]. Thus, there might be three roles for microtubules and the dynein\u2013dynactin complex during vaccinia morphogenesis. First, to keep IMV anchored near the TGN; second, to maintain TGN organization; and third, to facilitate movement of IMVs from their site of assembly in the virus factory towards the TGN where they are wrapped and form the IEV.",

Further studies from Cunningham and colleagues, using confocal and electron microscopy, suggest that herpes nucleocapsids are indeed transported when fully assembled by a microtubule-dependent mechanism to the cell periphery [45]. However, viral envelope glycoproteins are transported separately to the plasma membrane via conventional transport vesicles [45].

            "text": "In the case of vaccinia virus, anterograde motility is better understood \u2014 or is it? IEV (which is formed when IMV becomes enwrapped within a membrane cisterna derived from the TGN) is able to nucleate actin tails that are similar to those formed by some species of Listeria and Shigella (reviewed in [11], [12]). IEVs are propelled through the cytoplasm of infected cells on the tips of actin tails, using the power of actin polymerization, until they contact the plasma membrane and extend into neighbouring cells. Vaccinia strains that are unable to induce actin tails have a small plaque phenotype suggesting they have reduced cell to cell spread [46], [47], [48]. Recent work has begun to identify the proteins involved in vaccinia-induced actin polymerization [49], [50], [51], [52]. The integral IEV membrane protein A36R, which has a cytoplasmic domain of \u223c195 residues, is responsible for initiating the cascade of events that leads to actin tail formation [51]. Although deletion and mutant analyses have demonstrated that A36R is required for actin tail assembly, it still remains to be established whether it is sufficient. Vaccinia actin tail formation is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of A36R by Src family kinases [51]. Phosphorylation of A36R results in recruitment of the adaptor molecule Nck, WASP-interacting protein (WIP) and N-WASP, which can activate the actin nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex [51], [52]. Thus, it appears that vaccinia achieves actin-based motility by mimicking and hijacking components of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways that normally occur at the plasma membrane. It remains to be determined which Src family kinase is responsible for A36R phosphorylation, how the virus activates the kinase and where in the cell phosphorylation of A36R occurs.",

Vaccinia virus particles are able to reach the cell periphery in the absence of actin tail formation (see images in [49]), suggesting that viral particles can also move out on microtubules. Indeed, microtubule-based anterograde movements of vaccinia virus particles do occur and are essential, as actin tails only form at the plasma membrane (JM Rietdorf, M Way, unpublished data). It appears that A36R-dependent actin tail formation is not common to all poxviruses. Myxoma, Shope fibroma and fowlpox viruses do not encode A36R homologues in their genomes, although variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, does. However, actin colocalizes with fowlpox virus close to the plasma membrane and depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D treatment reduces production of extracellular fowlpox virus [53].",

The problem is how do the other viral proteins and nucleic acids, which may well exist as a ribonucleic-acid\u2013protein complex, get to the site of virus assembly. Once again, unfortunately for the host, it appears that the cytoskeleton comes to the rescue, at least in the case of retroviruses. The Gag protein of murine leukemia virus interacts with KIF4, a microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor, both in vitro and in vivo\n[54], [55]. The same in vitro interaction has also been demonstrated for Mason\u2013Pfizer monkey, Rous sarcoma, human and simian immunodeficiency viruses, implicating microtubules and kinesin motors in the anterograde movements of retroviral components to the plasma membrane [55]. HIV Gag can also associate with actin in vivo and in vitro\n[56], [57]. The role of actin during infection remains to be established in vivo, but it probably functions during viral budding. Indeed, HIV virions contain actin and the actin-binding proteins erzin and moesin (which are associated with the plasma membrane) [58], [59]. Furthermore, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D reduces the release of HIV-1 from infected cells by 40% [60]. One can envisage a situation where retroviral Gag moves out to the plasma membrane on microtubules, there it associates with viral membrane proteins and actin during particle assembly and budding.",

            "text": "The colocalization of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) MP with microtubules in vivo and in vitro indicated early on that microtubules had an important role in viral spread [63], [64]. However, there was no evidence that the MP\u2013microtubule complexes were associated with viral nucleic acids. Recently in situ hybridisation methods have provided the missing link to demonstrate that viral RNA (vRNA) colocalises with MPs and microtubules [65\u2022]. Nevertheless, it remained to be shown whether this colocalisation reflected a functional interaction that was important during infection. Three parallel studies have now addressed this issue [66], [67], [68]. First, it was demonstrated that increased association of MP with microtubules correlates with a higher rate of vRNA cell to cell spread [66]. Furthermore, both events take place more efficiently at higher temperature [66]. These observations are consistent with data from the second study of the distribution of GFP-labelled MP during temperature shifts that depolymerise/repolymerise microtubules [67]. MP association with filamentous structures (presumably microtubules) was lost upon microtubule depolymerisation by cold treatment; this effect was reversible when microtubules were repolymerised [67]. Further indirect evidence for a role of microtubles in vRNA transport comes from a mutant of MP that colocalises with vRNA but not with microtubules. This mutation results in MP and associated vRNA accumulation in a perinuclear region, presumably due to its inability to interact and move on microtubules [67]. The third study provided the most definitive answer to this issue (i.e. does colocalisation of microtubules with MP reflect a functional interaction important in infection spread) using a different elegant approach [68\u2022\u2022]. Boyko et al. [68\u2022\u2022] identified a short amino-acid sequence motif conserved among MPs of different TMVs that was also present in \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-tubulin. Mutagenesis of this motif in MP resulted in inhibition of vRNA transport and prevented association of MP with microtubules at the restrictive temperature. However, this movement-deficient phenotype was readily reversed at the permissive temperature, indicating that intercellular spread of vRNA depends on the association of MP with microtubules [68\u2022\u2022]. What is even more interesting is how MP associates with microtubules. Experiments with purified MP\u2013microtubule complexes reveal that the two proteins are very tightly associated and can only be separated by chaotropic reagents. This is in stark contrast to microtubule-associated proteins, which bind to the outside of microtubules and are readily dissociated by salt. Although no direct evidence is provided, Boyko et al. [68\u2022\u2022] suggest that MP co-assembles with tubulin and becomes an integral part of the microtubule lattice. Interestingly, expression of MP in mammalian cells results in loss of centrosomal \u03b3-tubulin staining, although there was no obvious association with the centrosome.",

On the basis of the partial colocalisation of the TMV MP with actin in vivo and an interaction in vitro, it has been proposed that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the transport of the MP\u2013nucleic-acid complexes through plasmodesmata [64]. However, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton has little effect on the localisation of MP [63], [64]. Thus, it has been suggested that the actin cytoskeleton may regulate the plasmodesmata size-exclusion-limit, rather than active transport of the nucleoprotein within and between cells (reviewed [61], [62]). An alternative or additional role for actin during infection has been proposed [65], [70]. During infection vRNA colocalises with MP and replicase in close proximity to the ER, suggesting that viral replication and translation take place on this membrane compartment. Colocalization of viral proteins and replication complexes with the ER have also been reported for tobacco etch potyvirus [71] and brome mosaic bromovirus [72], [73]. Disruption of the ER with brefeldin A, actin with cytochalasin D or microtubules with oryzralin all result in redistribution of vRNA and MP [65\u2022]. Thus, it is possible that the actin cytoskeleton imparts structural stability and motor activity to the plant cell ER, which is in turn required to anchor the replicase\u2013MP\u2013vRNA structures. Once replication is completed, microtubules take over and transport MP with the bound newly synthesised vRNA over long distances [65], [70]. This suggestion that actin provides structural and motor activity might explain the actin\u2013MP in vitro interaction [64]. Whether the ER itself plays a role in viral trafficking remains to be seen. It also remains to be examined whether host proteins, other than actin and tubulin, have a role in the transport of the nucleoprotein complexes within and between plant cells.",

However, in the absence of actin tail formation the actin cytoskeleton is still disrupted, suggesting that the vaccinia genome contains additional proteins that regulate or modify the actin cytoskeleton. Vaccinia infection also disrupts the microtubule cytoskeleton (Fig. 2\n[30]). This disruption is probably the consequence of overexpression of vaccinia-encoded microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and destruction of centrosome function. What is the advantage for vaccinia in disrupting microtubule cytoskeleton organization? The vaccinia MAP-like proteins, A10L and L4R, are essential components of the vaccinia core (the nucleocapsid), which is released into the cytoplasm during virus entry [19], [39]. In vitro, A10L and L4R mediate the interaction of vaccinia cores with microtubules [30], suggesting that vaccinia is likely to interact with microtubules via these proteins immediately after entry. The association of newly synthesised A10L and L4R with microtubules does not take place until later during infection, after extensive viral protein synthesis and particle assembly has occurred. Therefore, this association may play no functional role during infection and may merely represent the unavoidable side effect of accumulation of excess viral proteins with MAP properties in the cytoplasm of infected cells.",

Recent electron microscopy studies showed that cytomegalovirus infection also destabilises the centrosome [77], [78]. The lack of MTOC-organized microtubules in HSV-infected cells may also be indicative of a loss of centrosome function [74]. Understanding the mechanism by which vaccinia and cytomegalovirus disrupt centrosome function remains to be elucidated, but it is likely to provide some exciting insights into the regulation of this mysterious organelle. But why do viruses destroy the microtubule cytoskeleton organization that is so useful for viral transport? In the case of the vaccinia virus, disruption of microtubule cytoskeleton organization does not take place until after extensive virus assembly and transport to the periphery has taken place. Furthermore, the formation of long cellular extensions, up to 200\u03bcm in length, full of stable microtubles, which may not be possible in the presence of a functioning centrosome, provides a convenient way for the virus to travel long distances [30]. Although it should be possible to identify the viral proteins involved, we may never know whether cytopathic effects are truly useful to the virus or merely the consequence of viral protein side effects.",

As with vesicular membrane traffic, microtubules are the cytoskeletal element of choice for directed long range retrograde and anterograde transport of viral capsids or nucleoprotein complexes. The role of actin, on the other hand, largely appears to be concerned with events at the plasma membrane. These include viral entry and exit, and actin may provide an anchoring mechanism to assist virus particle assembly at the plasma membrane in addition to its role in budding or in mediating active outward transport, as with vaccinia virus. In the next few years we can expect to see more studies filling in our knowledge of cellular virus movements, which are usually vaguely eluded to in virology textbooks. Ultimately however, viruses may provide convenient and manipulable systems to dissect and understand motor protein function. They also provide a system to study cooperation and crosstalk between actin and microtubule cytoskeletons during transport.",
