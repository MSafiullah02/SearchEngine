Influenza A is generally considered to be clinically more severe than influenza B; influenza C causes only a mild illness confined to the upper respiratory tract. Circulation of influenza A and B viruses in humans (Figure 2\n) causes unpredictable seasonal epidemics of disease in temperate climates, with excess population morbidity and mortality, usually occurring between October and March in the northern hemisphere and lasting about 6\u20138 weeks.1 In the UK, 5000\u201310,000 deaths are associated with influenza A and B epidemics every year, and more than 20,000 in severe years. Widespread pandemics of severe disease occur less frequently, occurring on at least three occasions in the last century (1918, 1957, 1968), and have been associated with high mortality. In April 2009 a novel (H1N1) influenza virus emerged in humans and quickly spread worldwide leading to the declaration of the 2009 influenza pandemic.",

The pig was considered a suitable \u2018intermediate host\u2019, because both avian and human viruses, which differ slightly in their surface receptor requirements, can replicate in pigs. However, following transmission of H5N1 directly from birds to humans on 18 occasions in Hong Kong in 1997, and further zoonotic infections involving several different subtypes of influenza (Table 2\n), it is evident that cross-species barriers to transmission may be less stringent than was thought. Nevertheless, the requirements for adaptation of avian viruses to mammals are poorly understood. Cross-species transmission of novel subtypes into susceptible human populations (antigenic shift) are thought to be the source of pandemics of influenza.",

The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has a unique combination of genes obtained from swine viruses from North America and Eurasia. Substantial antigenic differences between the seasonal H1N1 virus that has circulated since 1977 and the pandemic H1N1 virus meant the human population was highly susceptible to the new virus and it quickly became the dominant influenza strain circulating worldwide. It caused an unusual peak of influenza activity in many Northern hemisphere countries, including the UK, during the summer months when few influenza detections are usually made (Figure 4\n). In the Southern hemisphere during the normal winter influenza season, the pandemic strain rapidly became dominant.",

Thus, influenza vaccines are given annually before the influenza season to boost pre-existing immunity, and the composition of the vaccine is updated regularly. In developed countries, the benefit of immunization has led to expansion of age-related vaccination policies.

Assessment of risk is important, because intravenous RSVIg is contraindicated in congenital cyanotic heart disease. Recombinant humanized RSV monoclonal antibodies are now available for intramuscular treatment and prophylaxis of RSV.
