A search on clinicaltrials.gov conducted on April 23, 2020 identified 363 phase I to IV interventional clinical trials for the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic (figure 1), involving a total of 170 treatments. Importantly, 143 trials (39%) involve treatments used daily by rheumatologists: 10 for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, 133 for DMARDs (88 hydroxychloroquine, 14 chloroquine, 14 tocilizumab, 8 sarilumab, 6 colchicine, 4 anakinra, 3 baricitinib, 1 tofacitinib, 1 methotrexate, some trials testing several molecules at the same time in different arms). In addition, 46 trials (11%) are evaluating targeted therapies that are well known to rheumatologists because they are used in other indications (cancer immunotherapy or conventional immunosuppressants, n=9) or are under development in inflammatory diseases (n=37). Rheumatologists are thus experienced with drugs involved in more than 50% of the COVID-19 trials. Trials of specific anti-viral treatments (n=30) or evaluating vaccines (n=14) account for just over 10% of the trials (n=44). Fourty trials evaluated cellular therapies (n=22) or plasma transfusions from immunized patients (n=18). Twenty-one trials are evaluating oxygen therapy modalities or inhaled treatments. Seventeen trials are evaluating vitamin or dietary supplements. Finally, 52 are evaluating a wide variety of treatments, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, anti-aggregants, anticoagulants, antibiotics and other treatments or support therapy.",

The lack of data in this population in China raised concerns about susceptibility to severe forms in our patients. More recent European data, now suggest that they should not be at such a higher risk (3) . Of note, these reassuring data are subject to bias because these patients may have been confined earlier, more strictly and may protect themselves better than the general population. It is therefore our duty to continue to register these patients by describing both benign are severe forms in order to build a reliable database about this potentially at-risk population. Although discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy in the event of infection is logical and commonly done by patients themselves, the question of restarting it once the COVID-19 infection has been cured remains an unknown. Is there not a risk of viral reactivation by inhibiting the anti-viral response? Therefore, barrier measures should be emphasized as much as possible. Our patients must also be informed of the clinical signs that justify medical consultation (fever and respiratory manifestations). It is therefore important that they can easily contact their rheumatologist (4).",
