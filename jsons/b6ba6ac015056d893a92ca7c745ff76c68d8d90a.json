The majority of cases are acquired through inhalation of infected respiratory particles, contamination with infected surfaces or whilst performing aerosol-generating procedures. Basic infection prevention measures are essential to protect healthcare workers from contracting the disease when managing patients; consequently global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has exceeded supply in many regions. We present a novel, innovative polycarbonate shield designed for ENT clinicians performing tracheostomies. Clinical investigations using the shield demonstrated a sixteen-fold decrease in the number of particles detected at the position of the operating surgeon when the shield was used (particle size 0.3\u03bcm; with shield 27,000 versus 439,000 without shield). The shield, used with appropriate PPE, could therefore help to minimise exposure to aerosol generated particles such as during tracheostomies on patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Airborne mechanisms of transmission vary depending on particle size. Larger particles (>5\u03bcm diameter) are called droplets. 3 Droplet spread occurs when droplets containing coronavirus are expressed from an infected individual through a cough or sneeze to make contact with exposed mucosal surfaces, either directly, or from contact with contaminated surfaces. Aerosols or droplet nuclei are smaller particles (<5\u03bcm) that due to their smaller size are able to remain airborne, transmitting the virus if they are inhaled into the lungs. 3 Aerosol transmission can occur up to 3 hours after the release of viral particles. 4 Ninetyseven percent of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol particles have an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1\u03bcm (range 0.1\u03bcm to 900\u03bcm) and a dominance of between 0.25\u03bcm and 0.5\u03bcm. 5, 6 Airway procedures that generate aerosols, such as tracheostomy, increase the risk of disease spread from infected patients. Tracheostomy is required for a significant proportion of ventilated COVID-19 patients weaning from ventilation. In studies of similar coronaviruses, tracheal intubation and tracheostomy were found to be associated with a 6fold and 4-fold increased risk respectively, of transmission to healthcare workers. 7 We hypothesise that barrier protection, with an aspiration unit, may decrease the number of particles that clinicians performing tracheostomies are exposed to, compared to no barrier at all. To test this hypothesis, we performed a clinical simulation on a hospital ward using a novel protective barrier, the St George's shield. The St George's shield is a bespoke barrier protection that encases the patient undergoing a tracheostomy.",

The surgeon (location C) was exposed to a notably greater number of aerosol particles when compared to the anaesthetist (an average of 27,500 for methods 1 and 2), scrub nurse (an average of 38,000 for methods 1 and 2) and other theatre personnel (an average of 26,000 for methods 1 and 2). The risk of aerosol particle exposure to the surgeon is greatly mitigated with the use of the shield, to levels comparable with the rest of the theatre environment (a difference of 7000 for method 1 and 1,387,000 for method 2). The difference in aerosol particle detection at location D is also notable (7000 less particles using method 1 and 1,222,000 using method 2).

Over a period of 10 minutes, the detection of particles (0.3\u03bcm, 2.5\u03bcm and 10\u03bcm) decreased to at least that of the level of the ambient environment. (Table 2 ) This is important as it illustrates that there is no apparent risk of the particles being contained within the shield and consequently released into the immediate atmosphere once the shield is removed from the patient. Although we estimate that the elapsed time between opening the trachea and finishing the procedure will be greater than 10 minutes, the addition of using an aspiration unit further increases the speed by which particle levels return back to that of the ambient environment (1 minute with an aspiration unit versus 10 minutes without).",

Additionally, the experiment illustrated that over time, the level of particles (0.3\u03bcm, 2.5\u03bcm and 10\u03bcm) decreased to ambient environment levels or below.
