They have a genome that has a high mutation rate and they display a great antigenic diversity.1 According to their core protein, they can be classified into three distinct types: A, B, and C. They have two major antigenic surface glycoproteins embedded into the membrane: the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which induce the antibody response in humans.1 HA enables the virus to bind to sialic acid-galactose receptors on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells and to fuse with the host membrane. The human and mammalian receptors are different but still present in different proportions in tissues of both species. NA functions as an enzyme to remove sialic acid, thus promoting dispersion during the budding of new virions from the infected cell.1, 2, 3, 4\n",

At the same time, more evidence supports the role of the international illegal poultry trade. It is possible that this trade contributed to the 2006 H5N1 outbreak in a large commercial farm in Kaduna State in the northern part of Nigeria.

As opposed to the earlier H5 viruses, the more recently circulating H5 viruses appear to be more pathogenic in mammals and birds. This is a feature that may precede the emergence of reassorted H5 strains with pandemic potential.17, 24 Although virulence determinants are polygenic traits, the possible major contributing factor is the hemagglutinin molecule. The acquisition of a multi-basic amino acid sequence at the cleavage site of a hemagglutinin belonging to the H5 or H7 subtypes enables its widespread cleavage by ubiquitous tissue proteases, resulting in multi-organ infection and high pathogenicity.25, 26\n",

Like the 1918 virus, H5N1 is associated with unusually high death rates in humans; in fact the case death rate is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 virus (50% vs. 2.5%).30 Continuous evolution of the H5N1 virus has been suggested by changes in the internal gene constellation, expanded host range, increased pathogenicity, and greater environmental stability.31, 32\n",

However, more recent viruses isolated in Thailand and Vietnam have amino acid substitutions within the M2 protein, which confer resistance to amantadine and rimantadine.39, 40 These viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors in animal models.41 Oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible. In an animal study where mice were inoculated with H5N1 virus isolated from a patient who did not survive the infection, the mice that were treated for eight days with oseltamivir had significantly better survival rates in all dose ranges when compared to animals that were treated for only five days.39 Prior animal studies demonstrated that five days of oseltamivir was effective against another H5N1 variant.42 Thus, treatment dose and duration may vary according to the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus.39\n",

Should H5N1 develop the ability to spread readily from person to person, this vaccine may provide early limited protection in the months before a vaccine tailored to the pandemic strain of the virus can be developed and produced. The vaccine will be kept in a federal stockpile and will be made available only through public health officials; it is approved for those aged 18 to 64 years who are at increased risk for H5N1 exposure.63\n",

However, there is no evidence to-date of the easy human-to-human transmission that is key for a pandemic.20, 21, 22, 23 With the emergence of influenza virus H5N1, the threat of an influenza pandemic seems to be real and inevitable, but no one can predict when it might happen. According to a study by the Congressional Budget Office, the consequences of a severe pandemic could, in the USA, include 200 million people infected, 90 million clinically ill, and 2 million dead. The study estimated that 30% of all workers would become ill and 2.5% would die, resulting in a decrease in the gross domestic product of 5%. Furthermore, 18 to 45 million people would require outpatient care, and the economic cost would total approximately $675 billion.64\n",
