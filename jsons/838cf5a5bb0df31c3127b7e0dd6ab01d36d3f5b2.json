Even in patients with advanced-stage HD and aggressive NHL, complete remission can be achieved in up to 75% of patients at first presentation with proper management [1, 2] . Accurate risk factor profiling using staging and established predictors of outcome, including gene profiting as well as effective restaging and response evaluation during or following therapy are prerequisites in the determination of optimal treatment. This may also lead to selection of a proper subset of patients in whom radiation therapy (RT) could be avoided. Anatomic imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) lack the ability to identify lymphoma in normal size lymph nodes and are unable to differentiate nodes which are enlarged due to other therapy-related benign causes [3] . Similar to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are not specific for viable tumor and cannot differentiate active lymphoma from infectious or inflammatory processes including radiation fibrosis [4, 5] . Ga-67 scintigraphy, despite its proven prognostic value as a predictor of therapy response during or after therapy, suffers from low spatial resolution, lack of specificity, low sensitivity in infradiaphragmatic lesions, and low-grade lymphoma [6, 7] . Ga-67 scintigraphy has now largely been superseded by positron emission tomography imaging using [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET).",

There is now convincing evidence that FDG PET is a more accurate imaging modality in the staging and evaluation of treatment response in lymphomas compared to conventional imaging techniques [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , including both CT and Ga-67 scintigraphy. Furthermore, persistent FDG uptake during and after chemotherapy has proven highly sensitive and specific in the differentiation of residual viable disease from benign posttherapy changes. This superior feature can potentially alter patient management and outcome by identifying the subset of patients requiring additional therapy or a change in treatment regimen. The accuracy of FDG PET imaging has significantly improved with the recent introduction of combined modality PET-CT [19] . PET-CT provides a comprehensive examination that combines morphologic diagnosis and functional/metabolic information in the same imaging session [21] .",

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification subsequently updated the REAL system with minor modifications [23] . This integrated system -WHO/ REAL classification -is currently in clinical use for both HD and NHL [24] . Despite the complexity and diversity of this integrated system, lymphomas are traditionally subdivided into two broad categories: Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Also for practical purposes NHL can be classified into indolent (low-grade) and aggressive lymphomas. NHL accounts for more than 85% of the lymphomas. Aggressive lymphomas constitute approximately 60% of NHL series, while indolent lymphomas account for approximately 40% of new diagnoses. The vast majority of NHL (~90%) are of B-cell origin. Early stage lymphoma is curable in greater than 75% of patients; however, advanced stage disease is curable in only 50% of patients [25] .",

Although staging is clinically important, studies of immunophenotype and molecular genetics are essential to refine diagnosis and management, particularly in NHL. Until recently, extended field RT has been considered the standard treatment for early stage HD. There is, however, an increasing trend to employ chemotherapy and most groups adopted a strategy using short duration chemotherapy combined with involved field RT (restricted to involved lymph nodes) in this group of patients [30] . Advanced stage (stages III-IV) disease is invariably treated with multiple chemotherapy protocols. Thus, staging still holds its critical position in the management of lymphoma even with the latest changes in therapeutic approach. In patients with HD or aggressive NHL (mostly DLCL), the therapy objective is the complete eradication of disease while minimizing adverse short-or long-term complications of therapy, particularly related to the RT. Unnecessary use of RT could result in excess toxicity such as secondary Table 22 .1 Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node region or involvement of a single extralymphatic organ Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm or localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site plus an involved lymph node region on the same side of the diaphragm Stage III Involvement of lymph nodes involved on both sides of the diaphragm can be accompanied by extralymphatic organ involvement including the spleen Stage IV Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs with or without associated lymph node involvement The presence or absence of the following symptoms should be noted with each stage designation A = asymptomatic B = fever, sweats, or weight loss greater than 10% of body weight malignancies and cardiac disease, while appropriate use can potentially decrease risk of disease recurrence and allow for shorter courses of chemotherapy cycles attendant reduction of chemotherapy toxicity [31] . Hence, segregating patients who could achieve cure without the need of RT is an important management strategy involving imaging. Perhaps the most clinically relevant issue surrounding aggressive NHL and HD is the ability to perform prognostic determination. FDG PET findings can be an independent predictor of tumor response or complementary to the established prognostic factors; international prognostic index in NHL and international prognostic score in HD, and potentially contribute to, or single-handedly, direct a change in management. For this concept to be of practical value, however, alternative treatment options should be available and also establishment of prognosis as favorable or poor must be followed up with a treatment change that is necessary and sufficiently effective to improve outcomes.",

The prognosis is invariably poor, however, due to aggressive and progressive clinical course with no curative conventional therapy generally available. Imaging for staging purposes does not have major influence on management due to disseminated nature of disease; however, evaluation of therapy response is important for potential therapeutic alterations.

The treatment in indolent lymphomas is defined by clinical symptoms rather than disease extent; therefore, determination of extent of disease or therapy response may not lead to improved outcomes. With current therapeutic strategies, identification of additional disease sites using PET-CT in the staging of indolent NHL is not an important determinant of management, as 80-90% of patients initially present with advanced-stage disease with generalized nodal and extranodal disease (mainly BM) involvement. New approaches combining classical dose-intense chemotherapy with \"tumor-specific\" antibody targeting may lead to a survival benefit [32] , potentially increasing the role of imaging in the management of low-grade NHL. Nonetheless, imaging currently has a limited role in the management of indolent lymphoma owing to specific features of the disease. A characteristic of indolent lymphomas is the phenomenon of spontaneous regression. Such spontaneous regression is usually partial and short-lived, and imaging findings can help determine the disease status which may prompt therapy during the active course of disease. Other characteristics of indolent lymphomas include synchronous discordant lymphomas (20-30% of newly diagnosed patients) and transformation to an aggressive subtype (30-50%) during the first 10 years following diagnosis [33] . In these situations, PET-CT has a definite role to determine the sites of discordant lymphomas as well as transformation for biopsy guidance and subsequent effective management.",

Additionally, MRI offers advantages including better tissue discrimination, lack of ionizing radiation and use of contrast agents with less risk of systemic effects [34] [35] [36] .

Mediastinal HD is characterized by the presence of a discrete anterior superior mediastinal mass with surface lobulation due to involvement and coalescence of multiple lymph nodes ( Fig. 22. 2), while characteristic features of mediastinal aggressive NHL, mainly diffuse large cell type, included regular contour and absence of associated cervical and abdominal lymphadenopathy [38] .

In a small study of 19 patients with nodal disease (either HD or aggressive NHL) evaluated by both PET-CT and separately acquired contrast enhanced CT studies [53] , PET-CT demonstrated additional lesions in four patients which were not detected on contrast-enhanced CT, while contrast-enhanced CT did not depict any nodal involvement that was undetectable on PET-CT [53] . As noted, however, when the lymphoma subtype is one with characteristically low or absent FDG tracer uptake, such as MALT, CLL/SLL, peripheral T cell, and low-grade follicular lymphoma, the CT findings based on lymph node size will be the chief criterion for nodal involvement.",

Bone and BM involvement is more common in NHL (especially in low-grade lymphoma) than in HD and confers stage IV disease. MRI is more sensitive than biopsy in detecting BM infiltration due to sampling errors associated with biopsy. It is becoming now feasible to routinely assess the entire marrow using MRI; however, in the follow-up period, persistent posttherapy MRI abnormalities may give rise to false positive results [59] . Cortical bone involvement can be primary or secondary, the former is usually of NHL type. Primary bone lymphoma has a tendency to involve the metaphyseal regions of the appendicular skeleton while secondary bone lymphoma usually involves the spine. In patients with bone involvement by direct extension from adjacent nodal disease, as it happens in HD, stage does not change. Bone involvement of HD is more often sclerotic (~50%) and NHL is osteolytic (~80%). This condition is denoted as \"E.\" In patients with both BM and adjacent soft tissue involvement, MRI is preferred over CT; however, assessment of cortical bone integrity is performed with CT for better definition of disease.",

There are no systematic prospective data comparing T1-201 findings with those of FDG PET in the evaluation of CNS lymphoma, however, in few anecdotal cases we have observed that the sensitivity of FDG PET appears to be better than T1-201 imaging in the detection of CNS lymphoma.

In general, the show the 3-cm precaval lymph node mass which is intensely FDG avid, and multiple foci of abnormal FDG tracer uptake in the skeleton, and the liver and spleen with subtle corresponding findings on the portal venous-enhanced CT images of the liver and spleen, but no corresponding CT findings in the involved skeleton.

The disseminated involvement of extralymphatic organs renders the patient stage IV incidence is very low in patients with HD (as low as 1-2%), while it is commonly observed in low-grade lymphoma (mainly follicular cell subtype) (60-70%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma (90-100%). In aggressive NHL (mainly diffuse large cell lymphoma), BM infiltration is seen in 25-40% of patients [70] . BM biopsy is the mainstay of BM evaluation despite its association with a high rate of false-negative findings due to sampling errors. MRI is especially useful in detecting BM involvement; however, its sensitivity is much higher than its specificity and thus benign entities such as hemangiomas and inflammatory processes can easily mimic lymphoma. Overall, focal FDG uptake suggests pathological BM activity, a pattern more commonly seen in HD patients (Fig. 22.11) . In aggressive NHL, the degree of BM involvement may range from a few cells to complete marrow replacement. In cases with the latter condition, FDG uptake is usually diffuse and somewhat heterogeneous. Diffusely increased FDG uptake is also observed in patients with BM hyperplasia, particularly following administration of colony stimulating factors (e.g., G-CSF) (Fig. 22.12) [71, 72] .",

The discrepancy in the detection sensitivity between Ga-67 and FDG PET imaging has recently been shown to be independent of the disease volume, location, and histology in both nodal and extranodal disease. The discrepancy in the detection sensitivity between these two radiotracers can be explained not only by the superior counting statistics and spatial resolution of PET tomograph technology, but also by biologic differences considering the significant disparities in the mechanism of uptake of Ga-67 and FDG [80, 81] . Consequently, at present, FDG PET, particularly PET-CT, has largely downgraded Ga-67 imaging to an infection imaging agent from its past position as a staging or restaging modality in HD or aggressive NHL.",

Even in the aggressive lymphomas, one should realize that not all stage changes as a result of PET-CT findings would translate into changes in therapeutic strategy. In routine practice, the stage category is usually altered within the same risk category (early stage vs advanced stage) and thus does not lead to management changes, but if additional information obtained from FDG PET, upstages early stage disease to advanced stage or vice versa, and therapy may be changed accordingly. Hence, the additional information provided by FDG PET is felt to be more useful in patients who are diagnosed with early stage Anterior FDG PET MIP image (a) reveals intense heterogenous FDG tracer uptake in the spleen as well as lymph node involvement above and below the diaphragm, including bulky retroperitoneal disease. Transaxial contrast-enhanced CT (b) and FDG PET (c) images demonstrate diffusely increased FDG tracer uptake throughout the spleen with additional multiple intense foci of abnormal FDG tracer uptake. Subtle corresponding regions of decreased attenuation are seen on the portal venous phase contrastenhanced CT images. Lymphomatous involvement of the spleen can manifest as a spleen with no parenchymal abnormalities on the CT images, including contrast-enhanced CT images (d), but with uniform intense abnormal FDG tracer activity on the FDG PET images (e) disease than in advanced stage disease as treatment strategy may be altered by detection of unexpected disease sites in the former patient population not in the latter [82] .",

Assessment of therapy response is therefore, more important in patients with advanced stage disease than with early stage. Also one important issue is that the treatment strategy for aggressive NHL is determined based upon immunophenotype and molecular genetics of the tumor rather than the anatomic extent alone. Aggressive NHL is treated exclusively with chemotherapy except in some cases local therapy may be added.

Differences in slice thickness and inconsistencies in the use of intravenous contrast may render the comparisons difficult. Following therapy, the mass attenuation values of the lymph nodes decreases with or without overall reduction in lymph node size in responding patients; however, there is no established standard for an accurate categorization of responders and nonresponders based on CT criteria. Achieving a complete response, which is defined as complete disappearance of the tumor mass, is the goal of cytotoxic therapy. However, failure to completely eradicate tumor mass with chemotherapy does not always correlate with persistent tumor cells or unfavorable prognosis [89] . This dilemma on anatomic imaging has been recognized in the response criteria for both HD and NHL [90, 91] . Both systems designate residual masses of unclear etiology as CRu, or unconfirmed/uncertain complete responses due to inherent uncertainty associated with posttherapy residual CT masses. Naturally, further and aggressive treatment in patients with benign posttherapy masses only increases morbidity and risk of second malignancies [31] . The patients with HD are at a higher risk of developing solid tumors years after therapy as a long-term side effect of combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. New masses discovered more than 10 years after therapy in the lung, thyroid, breast, and stomach should be considered as de novo primary tumors and must be verified by biopsy [92] .",

Despite reported high negative predictive values of greater than 90% obtained FDG PET by various investigators, false-negative findings are inevitable in cases with residual microscopic disease. Nevertheless, positive predictive value of FDG PET, also on the order of 90%, should be regarded more vital in the context of identifying patients who need immediate therapy changes or additional treatment after first-line therapy. In this group of patients, FDG PET could also avoid unnecessary further therapy in patients who achieve complete response to chemotherapy. One major concern that has not been addressed adequately, however, is the definition of patient population who would require further treatment with RT in the presence of false-negative findings associated with undetectable low-burden disease.",

The IPS for HD (Table 22 .5) is based on seven adverse factors, while the IPI, the most widely used system for aggressive NHL (Table 22 .6), predicts the risk of recurrence and overall survival by taking into account five adverse factors [102] . In this regard, sequential FDG PET imaging has a role in the determination of tumor response rates [16, 95-99, 103, 104] . For example, in patients categorized as high risk for recurrence by IPI or IPS criteria, recurrent lymphoma should be anticipated in almost all patients with posttherapy residual abnormal FDG tracer uptake and in slightly under half of those with residual posttherapy CT masses [16, 97, 103] . (c) and FDG PET images (d) performed prior to therapy reveal the extensive mesenteric lymph node involvement with a conglomerate mass as well as an involved left axillary lymph node.

There is additionally on the posttherapy FDG PET diffuse increased bone marrow FDG tracer uptake reflecting the use of hematopoietic stimulants in the chemotherapy regimen.

Patients with less than 25% decrease in SUV measured FDG tracer uptake in the lymphoma after HDT had a progressive disease course while among those with more than 25% decrease in SUVs, 86% remained in complete remission [108] . Similarly, another study found none of the patients with complete resolution of FDG tracer uptake in response to the initial course of therapy before HDT/SCT relapsed subsequently [109] , while seven or eight patients with a moderate or high FDG tracer uptake before HDT/SCT relapsed [109] .",

            "text": "Based on in vitro studies, FDG tracer uptake is proportional to the viable tumor cells, and viable tumor cells decrease early during effective chemotherapy. In a clinical study, 7 days after initiation of chemotherapy, tumor glucose metabolism as measured by FDG tracer uptake decreased by at least 74% in responding patients [113] . All lesions displayed a further decrease of FDG tracer uptake resulting in a total decrease of 83-96% from baseline to day 42 after initiation of therapy. There was no indication initial enhancement of FDG uptake as suggested by data from cell culture and animal studies. Further, the FDG tracer uptake values at day 42 were lower in patients with long-term remission compared to patients with early relapse [113] . Similarly, persistent FDG tracer uptake in the lymphoma after two to four cycles of chemotherapy was reported to predict poor progression-free survival in patients with aggressive NHL and HD [105, 106] . Persistent FDG uptake after a few cycles of chemotherapy was associated with relapse rates ranging from 70% to 100% while the relapse rate in patients with complete disappearance of FDG tracer uptake during therapy was as low as 8%. In one study, at midtreatment, none of the patients with persistent abnormal FDG tracer uptake achieved a durable complete remission, while 84% of patients with negative FDG PET results remained in complete remission after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years [106] . In this study, multivariate analysis revealed that FDG PET at midtreatment was a stronger prognostic factor for progression free survival compared with IPI criteria. Could FDG PET predict as early as after one cycle of chemotherapy? It has been demonstrated that FDG PET after one cycle of chemotherapy was predictive of long-term outcome in aggressive NHL and HD [104, 114] . In one series by Kostakoglu et al., patients with persistent FDG uptake after one cycle of chemotherapy had a shorter progression free survival (median, 5 months) than those with negative FDG PET results (progression-free survival medians not reached) after a follow-up of 36 months [104] . The positive and negative predictive values for FDG PET after one cycle chemotherapy were 90% and 85%, respectively. However, these results were obtained on a dual-head camera system which lacks sensitivity and therefore may give rise false-negative results. Recently, in a study by the same investigators, using a dedicated full ring PET system, all patients (17 patients) with no appreciable FDG uptake after one cycle of chemotherapy remained in complete remission after a follow-up of 12 months, whereas 90% of patients with a positive FDG PET result had a relapse or persistent disease requiring further therapy, including bone marrow transplantation. These are promising results; nonetheless, these data should be interpreted with caution until larger, multi-institutional studies with a longer follow-up period are executed. Additionally, comparison of the predictive value of early FDG PET scanning to more conventional prognostic measures (such as the International Prognostic Index in aggressive lymphoma) as not yet been performed with sufficient patients to establish whether FDG PET derived early response criteria provides superior or complementary prognostic information.",

In addition to diagnosis and staging and restaging of malignant disease, combined PET-CT is useful in planning radiation therapy and determining the optimum approach for CT-guided biopsy [21, 53] .

LPD can be divided into two broad categories; benign and posttransplantation. The benign LPD most frequently manifest in the thorax, where the site can be the lymph nodes or in the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue of the lung [116] . Entities such as plasma cell granuloma, pseudolymphoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis involve the pulmonary parenchyma as a primary site of intrathoracic disease, while Castleman's disease, infectious mononucleosis and angioimmunoblastic Unusual lesion distribution pattern \u2022 Distribution of FDG uptake outside patterns described in Tables 22.3A and B should raise a question about second malignancies, particularly in the breast, liver, lung, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, and prostate. BM Bone marrow, chemo chemotherapy, GCSF granulocyte colony stimulator factor, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, LN lymph nodes, LPD lymphoproliferative disorder, RT radiation therapy lymphadenopathy involve intrathoracic lymph nodes. It is important to differentiate the \"benign\" forms of LPD from the more common, aggressive lymphomas. Overall, intrathoracic disease confined to one compartment, either lymph nodes or lung parenchyma, implies a more benign etiology whereas multiple sites of disease, a malignant neoplasm. There is considerable overlap between benign LPD and NHL, especially in the immunocompromised patients. One might assume that the FDG uptake would be lower in this benign form of LPD than that seen in aggressive NHL and HD. Only anecdotal case reports are available regarding the FDG uptake patterns in Castleman's disease in the literature [117, 118] . FDG accumulation in one of these case reports was modest (SUV: 6.2) in a hilar location and low in the other (SUV: 1.7-3.2) in a pelvic location. It is expected that in the indolent forms of NHL, the differentiation between benign LPD and lymphoma may not be possible. In the absence of a systematic study assessing FDG accumulation patterns, it is only speculative to discuss this topic; however, one must bear in mind that this category of diseases should be considered as a potential false-positive group among other granulomatous processes, especially in the posttherapy setting [119] .",

Rebound thymic hyperplasia is associated with increased FDG tracer uptake and increased thymus volume.

Lymphoma patients after therapy, in particular after bone marrow transplantation, can develop cellular immunodeficiency until the transplanted marrow engrafts and creates new white blood cells. These patients are extremely susceptible to infections. Pulmonary infections are the most frequent complications in BMT recipients [124] . Idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis/ARDS, pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus, aspergillus, and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of infections [125] . Additionally, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) often occurs during the first 3 months following an allogeneic BMT. To minimize the risk of graft rejection and GVHD, allogeneic BMT patients are given immunosuppressants to prevent GVHD before and after transplant. Use of these drugs, however, increases the risk of infection. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting PET-CT images in immunocompromised patients as infectious/inflammatory lesions and granulomas can be falsely interpreted as persistent or recurrent tumor.",
