As indicated in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-97247-3_1, there are three major characteristics that stand out in these case studies. First, the surveys uncover a wide variety of issues that are locally considered critical and pervasive threats to human security; political conflict and repression are included in this list, but we have found that the range of perceived human security threats is much wider than that. Second, human security consists of clusters of norms, and each component (freedom from fear and want, freedom to live in dignity, protection and empowerment) has been well understood , accepted, and put into practice in East Asian countries. Thus, the parts are already there, but another push seems necessary to elevate human security to a full-fledged international norm.",

As meticulously discussed in the comparative analysis in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-97247-3_13, this protective role of the state is generally appreciated by scholars and practitioners of human security in the region. In fact, wedding the idea of human security to the expected functions of national governments may be the most salient feature of the localization of the human security norm in East Asia. The same chapter also indicates that there is a shared perception that a host of serious human insecurities is caused by the process of rapid economic development in the region. It is imperative for us to pay closer attention to the quality of growth especially because the East Asian region is still a major engine of growth for the world economy.",

While the UNSG document was based on questionnaire surveys covering the broad UN member states, the present book complements it by advancing a focused inquiry targeting the East Asian region in more depth.

Although people may empower themselves without waiting for intervention from domestic authorities or international donors, our comparative analysis (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-97247-3_13) argues that in East Asia, governments are widely expected to extend parental care and lead people to the right path; we may call this \u201cguided empowerment.\u201d Some case studies in this volume review this function in a positive light, while others envision the promotion of civil society that will act as a democratic counterbalance to authoritarian governments. Although empowering people while protecting them appears to be a contradiction, those holding power may practice both in the passage of time in a similar way to the process in which parents protect and bring up children: the young will eventually take control of their own life and may challenge, and even protect, their parents. The notion of paternalism invites mixed, sometimes emotional reactions.1",

In short, empowered people will possess enhanced levels of problem-solving capacity. If the capacity of individuals and communities to make informed choices is weak, the government may have to set up institutions and provide resources to assist them in making their own decisions. Then, if the capacity of the government to empower people is weak, deficiencies could be filled by means of international aid. The practice of empowerment and that of capacity development are thus closely related.",

            "text": "The concept of capacity development gained currency among international donors in the early 2000s (Fukuda-Parr et al. 2002). Under the presidency of Sadako Ogata, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) took up the task of operationalizing capacity development at the same time as it absorbed the idea of human security. In its capacity assessment handbook, JICA distinguished three elements of capacity at each of the individual, organizational, and societal levels: the first element is the \u201ctechnical capacity,\u201d which takes the form of particular skills and knowledge (including tacit knowledge); the second is the \u201c core capacity,\u201d which refers to leadership capabilities and motivation to utilize the technical capacity; and the third is the \u201c enabling environment,\u201d which makes target organizations produce results with an increased capacity. JICA emphasizes the significance of nurturing the core capacity at the organizational level, which is supposed to be the leverage point in many cases (JICA 2008, 14\u201322). International donors including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the European Commission , the Department for International Development (DfID), and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Society for International Cooperation\u2014GIZ) GmbH have developed their principles and programs with regard to capacity development.",

In any case, if citizens are sufficiently empowered, they may want to change their environments and courses of life from bottom up or begin to resolve local problems collectively by themselves. Empowered individuals may also demand more of government authorities, and if the delivery is short of their expectations and perceived as unjust, they may want to \u201cpunish\u201d the national authorities through democratic mechanisms. Otherwise, the same citizens may want to sacrifice themselves voluntarily as \u201cunknown soldiers\u201d to preserve their own imagined (national) community in face of threats posed from the outside (B.

In the process of post-war decolonization, people in the newly independent nations called for the restoration of national dignity. The prevalence of dignity in the culture of the UN is closely related to the expansion of the territories in which people are regarded as members of legitimate sovereign nations to which the sacred right of self-determination has been conferred. In Northeast Asia, the concept of national dignity possessed by all formally sovereign and equal nations came into existence with the rise of modern nationalism in the twentieth century, resulting in entangled discourses of equality and hierarchy (Fitzgerald 2006). From the human security perspective, national dignity and individual dignity are both highly esteemed: human security requires international donors to pay respect to national self-determination and obliges national governments to respect the intrinsic value of individual citizens. The challenge is thus dual. The principle of ownership has become part and parcel of human security practice by incorporating the concept of dignity into the norm-complex.",

In terms of territory and population size, one may hesitate to lump China and Singapore together in the same category of nation states. In this region, presidential or parliamentary republics, constitutional monarchies, and communist regimes coexist side by side. Countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and China are rich in natural resources, while Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan are less endowed. Before anthropologists discovered the notion of cultural relativism, East Asians were long accustomed to this way of thinking; the region has accommodated diverse indigenous and exogenous cultures and religions like Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam as well as various sorts of animism. Hundreds of languages are spoken in Indonesia while basically one language is used in a country like Japan. However, such diversity has never hindered the economic development of East Asia. More than two decades after the publication of the , which attributed the rapid economic growth of the East Asian tigers to good education and appropriate industrial policies (World Bank 1993), most national economies continue growing with the strong backing of relatively efficient bureaucracies and capable administrations.

Despite the miraculous economic successes and deepening value chains in the region, a common security arrangement has not taken shape in East Asia, where sovereign nations still compete against each other openly. Since the 1950s, the North Atlantic world have nurtured layers of regional organizations, called \u201csecurity communities\u201d by Karl Deutsch and his colleagues, in which all community members expect that disputes among the states will be settled in peaceful , non-military ways (Deutsch et al. 1957). Given that the emergence of such security communities followed the deepening of economic and cultural ties rather than the formation of military alliances (Ruggie 1996, 85), the time for a security community in East Asia where we witness a remarkable degree of economic integration may already be ripe. However, a political community that would share sovereignty is not preferred in this region, and as shown in the case study chapters and discussed later in this chapter, most are also skeptical about the R2P style intervention within the region. Nevertheless, in East Asia, it may not be difficult to reach a consensus to organize multiple cooperative platforms2 to address particular human security challenges, thereby building a pluralistic \u201chuman security community\u201d in which member states collaborate while retaining national sovereignty (Hernandez et al. 2018).",

Among the five world regions (Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe, and Oceania), from 2006 to 2015, 40 percent of natural disasters took place in Asia, and 51 percent of the related total casualties were people who lived in the region (IFRC 2016, 232\u20133).

It is widely known that hierarchical regimes with centralized power structures historically developed in the plain regions of the Eurasian continent, while flexible, amorphous, and network-based polities prevailed largely in mountain areas as well as islands and archipelagoes in the Pacific (see, e.g., Geertz 1980; Scott 2009). Today, we face an intriguing paradox: while traditionally centripetal governments in China, Japan, and South Korea develop strained relationships among themselves, relatively centrifugal governments in Southeast Asia have steadily and tenaciously advanced the community formation of ASEAN . The future of a human security community in East Asia hinges upon whether equal partnership can be matured between these two asymmetric powers, namely, between ASEAN and the \u201cPlus Three.\u201d A positive aspect is that, despite the political rivalry, a culture of mutual respect is gradually fostered, and there are active collaborative networks in civil society, business, and academia across the region. If East Asia can sustain growth while assuming the responsibility to address global human security issues, the region may give rise to an Asian version of the OECD in the future.",

Presently, the most important multilateral framework to solve global problems is the SDGs.

The SDGs build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but \u201cthe new Goals are unique in that they call for action by all countries\u2014poor, rich, and middle-income\u2014to promote prosperity while protecting the planet.\u201d Moreover, \u201cwhile the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for achievement of the 17 Goals.\u201d3 East Asian countries have already started to elaborate their own programs to meet these goals by 2030, and their efforts will be accelerated as the target year draws nearer.",

Although the SDGs seek a strong alliance with the private sector and civil society, Article 41 of Agenda 2030 notes that the state can play a significant role: \u201cWe recognize that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development.\u201d Second, the SDGs appear to pay less attention to risks and resilience that feature the discourses of human security, and this gap is expected to open a new field of complementary action. As Fig. 14.1 shows, the process of human development cannot be a linear progress. If development is the process of expanding people\u2019s freedom, human security aims at removing sources of people\u2019s unfreedom. Calamities such as wars, armed conflicts, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and natural and human-made disasters pounce upon a wide swath of people at a time. The focus on these \u201cdownside risks\u201d is part of the theoretical underpinnings of the human security concept (Sen 2014). In the risk-prone societies of our time , even though both haves and have-nots are equally exposed to cross-border threats such as air pollution, multiple risks compel the most vulnerable people to suffer most, intensifying their insecurities (Beck 1992). These are the people who need to be protected and empowered most urgently.",

The socially excluded persons living with human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) may not have access to effective treatment even though the government provides such a service. In debt-laden households, young voiceless children fall prey to human trafficking. People who have no choice but to live in a wetland delta have their houses swept away by deluges caused by global climate change. People who cannot but choose the cheapest foods are exposed to the risks of dangerous food additives. And finally, those who have decided to sacrifice their lives for others may be tortured and \u201cdisappear\u201d when the government turns against its own citizens.

Traditionally, the UNSG regarded inter-state wars as the central threats to peace and security of the world, but the UN has already begun to discuss ways to address global risks other than classic wars, such as economic and social threats (including poverty, diseases, and environmental degradation), violent conflict within the nation, new weapons, terrorism, and transnational organized crime (UN 2004). While the SDGs aim to reach a set of prescribed goals, human security strives to deal with the obstacles in the way of these shared goals and examines who are affected most adversely by those obstacles. Amartya Sen proposed a methodology of disaggregation in his Poverty and Famine, a classic analysis of famine crises in South Asia and Africa (Sen 1981): even when the total food supply seems to be sufficient in the nationally aggregated data, specific groups (including landless people) can starve to death, especially when they are wracked by ferocious market forces. Focusing attention on such variables as gender, generation, occupation, and geographic location, we should be able to clearly understand the differential vulnerability of particular communities and individuals to human security threats.4",

We can also check how many times the keywords of human security such as want, fear, dignity, protection, and empowerment appear in the text of the SDGs; for example , empowerment is explicitly used in Goal 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls). However, these exercises to find thematic overlaps may be misleading, as an international norm is not just a set of issues and keywords but a certain collective expectation for appropriate action. The idea and practice of human security have unique potential to contribute to the overall achievement of the SDGs through its focus on risks, vulnerability, and an ethical imperative of \u201cno one left behind\u201d as a global concern.",

According to this document, a common understanding of human security includes: \u201cThe right of people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair. All individuals, in particular the vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human potential.\u201d In this text, freedom is defined in terms of the duality of peace (absence of fear) and development (elimination of want), and juxtaposed with the right to live in dignity, with special emphasis given to the rights of vulnerable people. Development of \u201chuman potential\u201d resonates with the idea of human development, which was originally defined as the process of enlarging people\u2019s choices. The resolution fleshes out the concept further in subsequent paragraphs that begin with: \u201c(b) Human security calls for people-centred, comprehensive, context-specific and prevention-oriented responses that strengthen the protection and empowerment of all people and all communities.\u201d",

This is one of the reasons why the title of this book is Human Security Norms in the plural, rather than the human security norm in the singular (the other reason lies in a variety of interpretations of the concept in different countries in East Asia). Since the introduction of the concept to the UN discourse around 1994, human security has been regarded by some as a sort of \u201cpatchwork\u201d of norms. Human security was criticized by Paris (2001) and others as a \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cuseless\u201d concept in a series of debates that largely took place in the North Atlantic region.5 The definition of human security in the 2012 UNGA resolution was agreed upon as a compromise among diplomats from the UN member states with starkly different backgrounds.

In every respect, human security as defined in the 2012 resolution is the antithesis of the conventional interpretation of the R2P .6 The action to address humanitarian crises has been discussed much in the analogy of medical practice such as \u201cdo no harm,\u201d a phrase in the Hippocratic Oath (M.B. Anderson 1999). While the R2P is like a \u201csurgical\u201d or \u201cinvasive\u201d therapy targeting troubled society, human security seems closer to an \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201coriental\u201d medicine designed to promote the resilience of an organism.
