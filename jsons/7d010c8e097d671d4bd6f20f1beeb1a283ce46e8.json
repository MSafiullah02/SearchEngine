We describe a strategy to attenuate RNA viruses by altering their evolutionary potential. We rationally altered the genomes of Coxsackie B3 and influenza A viruses to redirect their evolutionary trajectories towards detrimental regions in sequence space. Specifically, viral genomes were engineered to harbour more serine and leucine codons with nonsense mutation targets: codons that could generate Stop mutations after a single nucleotide substitution. Indeed, these viruses generated more Stop mutations both in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by significant losses in viral fitness. In vivo, the viruses were attenuated, generated high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protected against lethal challenge. Our study demonstrates that cornering viruses in 'risky' areas of sequence space may be implemented as a broad-spectrum vaccine strategy against RNA viruses.",

In recent years, several severe outbreaks have occurred: chikungunya and Zika viruses in the Americas, coronaviruses in the Middle East, and Ebola virus in West Africa. Consequently, there is a need for rationally designed and broadly applicable vaccine strategies. Given their high mutation rates, large population sizes and short generation times, RNA viruses can evolve rapidly, and strategies to control RNA viruses should take into account this adaptive potential. Due to their mutation rates, RNA viruses generate networks of closely related genetic variants, linked through mutation 1 , that allow them to escape from selective pressures and adapt to different environments 2 . Ultradeep characterization of single nucleotide polymorphisms of viral populations reveals thousands of variants 3 heterogeneously distributed throughout the genome. This 'genetic architecture' suggests that certain mutations might be more or less accessible depending on the original nucleotide or codon, thereby defining different mutational neighbourhoods within the same sequence space 4 . In evolutionary biology, sequence space refers to every combination of a given sequence and theoretically is a vast multidimensional hypercube connecting all possible combinations. The localization of a virus population in sequence space, defined by its starting sequence, should then determine which mutational neighbourhoods are accessible. It is thus proposed that access to certain neighbourhoods will determine the potential of reaching beneficial mutations to facilitate adaptation 4, 5 .",

Most studies addressing how organisms explore sequence space are theoretical and tested in silico using digital organisms 6, 7 . Limited empirical data support the notion that the 'viable' sequence space is significantly smaller than the theoretical. For RNA viruses, most mutations are deleterious 8, 9 , and up to 40% of non-synonymous changes are lethal 3, 10 . This is further evidenced in lethal mutagenesis, where antiviral treatment with mutagenic compounds leads to extinction 11, 12 . Consequently, viruses have probably established a balance between generating beneficial mutations and tolerating detrimental ones. This trait, termed 'mutational robustness', is defined as 'phenotypic conservation in light of genetic variation' 13 . Given the biological constraints that limit the viable sequence space occupied by RNA viruses, we asked whether their capacity to explore sequence space (and, ultimately, their fitness) could be restricted by placing them closer to detrimental mutational neighbourhoods.",

Specifically, we rewired leucine and serine codons to constrain the expansion of viral populations towards detrimental mutational neighbourhoods, where the product of mutation would favour nonsense mutation targets resulting in Stop mutations. These engineered viruses were attenuated in vivo, with an increased number of Stop mutations in viral progeny. Animals immunized with these vaccine candidates were protected against lethal infection. We thus show that RNA viruses can be rationally attenuated by redirecting their evolutionary trajectories towards detrimental areas of sequence space.",

To minimize these factors, we introduced only synonymous changes, so that viral proteins retained the same amino-acid sequence and the same functions as wild-type virus. Furthermore, we only changed the codons for two amino acids with the highest codon redundancy (leucine and serine) to limit the overall change in nucleotide sequence to less than 5% and to focus on codons on which mutations would have the greatest impact on viability. Among the Leu and Ser codons, we defined a category termed '1-to-Stop', because point mutations on these codons could result in Stop mutations (Fig. 1a) . We also defined a 'NoStop' category, which in contrast requires two nucleotide changes to reach Stop mutations. For Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), we targeted the P1 structural protein-coding region (Fig. 1a) , which lacks RNA structural elements required for replication and translation. Because this viral RNA is translated into a single polyprotein that is cleaved into individual viral proteins, a Stop mutation appearing in this region will inactivate the virus. We thus generated CVB3 in which all 117 Ser/Leu codons in P1 were synonymously changed to either 1-to-Stop or NoStop categories. To investigate if this strategy can be applied broadly, we also targeted a very different RNA virus, the influenza A virus, which has a segmented, negative sense genome. In this case, two genomic segments were targeted independently: the PA polymerase subunit protein (111 Ser/Leu codons) or the haemagglutinin glycoprotein HA (94 Ser/Leu codons) (Fig. 1a) .",

We compared our viruses ( Fig. 1b) with those used by Coleman et al. 14 (PV-Min, PV-Max and PV-SD) to link codon pair bias and attenuation. These poliovirus (a related enterovirus) constructs were codon-shuffled in the same P1 region. The change in codon pair bias in our viruses was significantly less than for the PV-Min virus, which had 1,000-fold reduced replication 14 . Even PV-SD, which was not attenuated in their study, presented more bias than our constructs. The attenuation obtained from codon reshuffling can also result from dinucleotide bias, where higher CpG content decreases replication 15 . Compared to the dinucleotide frequency described for the highly attenuated echovirus 7 by Tulloch et al. 15 (CpG-high E7), no significant changes in CpG dinucleotide frequency were introduced in our 1-to-Stop and NoStop constructs (Fig. 1c) . Subsequently, we investigated the production of infectious particles for these viruses at high (Fig. 1d ,e) or low ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ,b) multiplicities of infection (MOI). All viruses grew to comparable final titres, although fewer infectious progeny were produced at some time points for the CVB3 1-to-Stop construct (Fig. 1d) . To test whether this was due to defects in replication, we quantified RNA genome synthesis. All viruses generated the same amounts of RNA at every time point (Fig. 1f,g) . We further confirmed these results in an in vitro RNA replication assay using replication complexes purified from infected cells, where yields for wild-type and 1-to-Stop viruses were equal ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Thus, our data showed that, for both CVB3 and influenza A virus, the altered Leu/Ser codons had no discernible impact on RNA synthesis and replication kinetics. Finally, genetic and phenotypic stabilities were evaluated after 10 passages. No reversion in Ser/Leu altered positions was observed, and each virus retained its phenotype (growth titres, relative number of Stop mutations) ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

The relative fitness of wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop viruses was measured under normal and mutagenic conditions against a neutral, genetically marked competitor 16, 17 . For CVB3 (Fig. 2a) , five mutagenic conditions were used: three base analogues (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)), amiloride (which perturbs intracellular Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ concentrations, essential cofactors of the viral polymerase 18 ) and Mn 2+ itself, which increases the polymerase error rate. In all cases, the 1-to-Stop virus presented significantly lower fitness than wildtype CVB3, while the NoStop virus presented the same or higher fitness (Fig. 2a) . Using an alternative method to evaluate viral fitness, we measured mean plaque size for each viral population treated with the three base analogues. The 1-to-Stop virus produced significantly smaller plaques, while the NoStop virus produced larger plaques (Fig. 2b) . The progeny viruses obtained during mutagenic treatments were then deep-sequenced, and sequence data were computationally treated to reduce noise (see Methods) and mathematically modelled to estimate error (see Supplementary Section 'Mathematical assessment of background noise'). The number of reads presenting Stop mutations was then calculated. As expected, 1-to-Stop virus samples contained significantly more reads with Stop mutations than wild-type virus, whereas NoStop had significantly fewer (Fig. 2c) . Finally, to further support that the 1-to-Stop viruses were sensitive to the increased mutational load on these codons, we coupled the 1-to-Stop virus with a high-fidelity polymerase 19 . This virus would have an intrinsically lower error rate to counter the extrinsically higher error resulting from mutagen treatment. Indeed, 1-to-Stop high-fidelity viruses recovered the wild-type virus phenotype ( Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

In fact, 1-to-Stop viruses exhibited up to 50-fold reduction in viral titres with ribavirin treatment (Fig. 3a , left) and a 100-fold decrease after high concentrations of Mn 2+ (Fig. 3c, left) . We then quantified the number of Stop mutations in the mutagen-treated progeny viruses for each replicate and at each concentration. The 1-to-Stop PA populations presented a dose-dependent and significantly higher increase in the number of Stop mutations along the PA gene compared to wild-type virus ( Fig. 3a -c, middle panels). As a control, the 1-to-Stop HA virus, which has a wild type-like PA sequence, did not present more Stop mutations in the PA gene. Instead, the 1-to-Stop HA virus presented more Stop mutations in the HA gene ( Fig. 3a -c, right panels).

Moreover, the treatment of these viruses with mutagens to extrinsically increase error rates resulted in even greater loss of infectivity. Previously, we have described CVB3 polymerase variants with intrinsically increased error rates that resemble mutagenic treatment 17 . We therefore engineered the low-fidelity viral polymerase I230F into the 1-to-Stop virus to generate a 'SpeedyStop' virus. We infected mice with wild-type, 1-to-Stop or SpeedyStop viruses and quantified virus titres in pancreata ( Fig. 5a ) and hearts (Fig. 5b ). The degree of attenuation significantly increased for SpeedyStop virus compared to its normal-fidelity counterpart. Virus was undetectable in some mouse organs as early as three days after infection, and no longer detectable in any organ by day 7. Accordingly, a survival curve of mice receiving a lethal dose of wild type and equivalent doses of 1-to-Stop and SpeedyStop viruses revealed the latter to be completely attenuated (Fig. 5c ). Finally, we deep-sequenced virus from infected tissues and confirmed that SpeedyStop presented a higher number of Stop mutations in sequencing reads than the other viruses (Fig. 5d ).",

To further investigate how 1-to-Stop populations may be constrained in their exploration of sequence space and the fitness landscape, we measured the relative fitness of wild-type and 1-to-Stop CVB3 in tissue culture in biological triplicates under five mutagenic conditions, as well as under normal conditions. A range of low to high mutagenic conditions was used to accelerate evolution in sequence space and to increase the mutational load. Under normal conditions, both viruses presented mostly positive fitness values (Fig. 6a) . Under mutagenic conditions, a greater proportion of wild-type samples presented positive fitness compared to 1-to-Stop virus (Fig. 6a) , and the relative decrease in fitness for 1-to-Stop virus was significant under every growth condition. In fact, only 3 populations out of 45 presented positive fitness values with respect to wild-type (Fig. 6b) . We then characterized the mutant spectra of each sample by wholegenome deep sequencing to calculate the mean entropy of each population, as a general measure of sequence space exploration. For illustrative purposes, we generated a fitness landscape-like model based on the entropy values coupled with their empirical fitness values (Fig. 6c) . The landscape reveals that for similar mean entropy values, 1-to-Stop populations consistently present a lower fitness and are unable to 'climb back up' to the fitness landscape occupied by wild-type virus.",

            "text": "In this work, we present a strategy to attenuate viruses based on evolutionary principles, by restricting their evolutionary potential. Our experimental design is based on the rational relocalization of viral populations in sequence space to redirect them towards detrimental regions of the fitness landscape. Sequence space is a conceptual framework that can help monitor adaptive walks and evolutionary trajectories. For RNA viruses rapidly expanding in sequence space, emerging minority mutations can foretell the directionality of evolution well before the entire population shifts 2,20 . In theory, however, sequence space is immensely larger than the subregions occupied by biologically viable genotypes. For RNA viruses, these constraints derive from the compact nature of their genomes, and the likelihood that a mutation will hit an essential function is high. Indeed, the majority of mutations are deleterious, as evidenced in many studies that intrinsically or extrinsically increase mutation rates 3,10,21-23 . Despite this, viruses retain high mutation rates to facilitate adaptation. Consequently, mutational robustness has been suggested as an important counter-mechanism 24 . Although better characterized in theoretical and in silico work [25] [26] [27] , some of the best experimental data have been obtained with non-coding RNA structures that assessed the retention of folding capacity or ribozyme activity in light of mutation 28 . Some evidence for mutational robustness has also been observed in RNA viruses [29] [30] [31] . A more recent study that analysed the largescale codon reshuffling of poliovirus reported the impact of altering mutational robustness 4 . However, the extent of codon changes was such that robustness could not be decoupled from other effects, such as CpG dinucleotide bias 15, 32 or codon pair bias 14, 33 .",

            "text": "Redesigning the genomic architecture of an RNA virus, as performed here, relies on using its evolutionary potential to its own detriment. Other studies have recoded all amino acids to achieve viral attenuation, but we focused on two amino acidsleucine and serine-for two main reasons. The first was to minimize the confounding effects of manipulating the genome. In contrast to previous strategies 14, 34 , we targeted less than 5% of the genome. These viruses were designed to minimize or exclude the effects of codon deoptimization [35] [36] [37] [38] , codon pair deoptimization 14, 33, 34 and CpG/UpA dinucleotide bias 15, 32, 39 . We thus modified a minimum number and class of codons to retain as much as possible of the wild-type identity. However, it should be noted that although the aforementioned effects were minimized, we cannot be certain that some of these factors cannot, at least partially, account for some of the observed attenuation. The second reason for focusing only on leucine and serine was to take advantage of the unique properties of the Leu and Ser codons. These codons are the most redundant, with the greatest range of exploration of sequence space. This feature was addressed in the mathematical framework designed by Archetti 40 and based on McLachlan's chemical similarity matrix 41 , which predicts the potential effect of point mutations over synonymous codons. These codons could be clustered into three groups, among which two were of particular interest for our design. The 1-to-Stop group presented the highest likelihood of changes into non-sense mutational targets (NSMTs). The other set contained the NoStop Ser/Leu codons, which are two mutations away from becoming a Stop codon, and made ideal controls with the same number of modifications.",

            "text": "By placing 1-to-Stop populations closer to detrimental mutational neighbourhoods, we conferred to them a lower mutational robustness that would be prone to the most detrimental type of mutation, the Stop mutation. Consequently, proximity to 'hostile' regions in sequence space may drive viruses to regions of lower fitness than a normal, more evolvable population 42 . It should be noted that, in addition to affecting mutational robustness, changes in adaptability and evolvability may also play into the attenuated phenotypes observed here. In addition, our findings experimentally support the notion that viruses may avoid volatile codons that neighbour Stop codons, as was proposed by Plotkin and Dushoff for influenza HA genes 43 . Moreover, deep sequencing supported the proposed mechanism of attenuation: an increase of three-to sixfold in Stop mutation frequencies. It should be noted that the absolute number of Stop mutations made during infection is probably higher than that captured at the moment of sampling, because such genomes cannot replicate and would thus be degraded and cleared. Regarding in vivo studies, the 1-to-Stop viruses exhibited clear, attenuated phenotypes. We have demonstrated that a 1-to-Stop vaccine stock could be readily produced in cell culture with genetic and phenotypic stability, is both immunogenic and protective against lethal infection, and that coupling a mutator polymerase to this construct enhances attenuation without compromising immunogenicity. In vivo attenuation was also associated with higher frequencies of Stop mutations in target organs and a higher loss of infectivity. Additionally, translation of RNAs containing Stop codons would result in truncated proteins that may contribute to a better activation of the immune system 44, 45 . Moreover, although non-viable genomes do not replicate, their presence could have further impact through defective interference 46, 47 or through an adjuvant effect, as observed for defective interfering genomes 48, 49 .",

We took several measures to reduce this concern. From a mathematical standpoint, we modelled the noise in our samples and confirmed that our data were unlikely to be affected (see Supplementary Information ). In addition, the background noise was further reduced by the maximum likelihood estimation of the frequencies, which takes base Phred quality scores into account. From an experimental and biological standpoint, we implemented many controls, such as the NoStop viral genomes that are as genetically modified as the 1-to-Stop genomes. We also increased sample sizes and biological replicates, performed work in two different RNA viruses, intrinsically (fidelity variants) and extrinsically (mutagenic treatment) altered mutation pressure, and performed work in different cell types and animals. In total, 25 independent experiments, in vitro and in vivo, produced 420 sequencing samples to determine Stop mutations. In all cases, 1-to-Stop generated more Stop mutations than wild-type virus and NoStop controls. Nevertheless, one must consider the noise within the data and must not rely on the absolute values of the measures, but rather their relative values within each experiment with respect to the controls.",

Finally, by modelling empirical data into an illustrative fitness landscape, we demonstrated that 1-to-Stop populations cannot escape the detrimental regions of sequence space associated with lower fitness. Our data suggest that this strategy could be broadly applied to potentially any RNA virus. In summary, our results are a proof of concept that viral genomes can be re-engineered to change their starting position in sequence space and redirect them towards detrimental mutational neighbourhoods, to generate 'suicidal', self-limiting vaccine strains.",

For real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of Coxsackie virus, total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified. The TaqMan RNA-to-C t one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to quantify viral RNA. Each 25 \u00b5l reaction contained 5 \u00b5l RNA, 100 \u00b5M each primer (forward 5\u2032-GCATATGGTGATGATGTGATCGCTAGC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-GGGGTACTGTTCATCTGCTCTAAA-3\u2032) and 25 pmol probe 5\u2032- GGTTACGGGCTGATCATG-3\u2032 in an ABI 7000 machine. Reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and was followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. A standard curve ( y = \u22120.2837x + 12,611, R 2 = 0.99912) was generated using in vitro transcribed genomic RNA. HeLa (Coxsackie virus B3) or MDCK (influenza A virus) cell monolayers in six-well plates were pretreated for 4 h with ribavirin, AZC, 5-FU, MnCl 2 or amiloride compounds at different concentrations. Cells were then infected at an MOI of 0.1 for Coxsackie and 0.001 for influenza A virus with passage 2 viruses. At 48 h post-infection, Coxsackie viruses were collected by three freeze-thaw cycles, and influenza A viruses were collected in clarified supernatant. Virus titres (TCID 50 or plaque assay) were determined. The same procedure was repeated for five passages under each different mutagenic condition in three biological replicates, except for influenza A viruses, which were passaged only in low mutagenic conditions in ribavirin, 5-FU and 5-AZC.",

For Coxsackie virus, relative fitness values were obtained by competing wild-type, NoStop and 1-to-Stop virus, obtained from different passages under each mutagen/compound, with a marked reference virus that contained four adjacent silent mutations in the polymerase region introduced by direct mutagenesis. Co-infections were performed in triplicate at an MOI of 0.01 using a 1:1 mixture of each variant with the reference virus. After 24 h, supernatants were collected and one volume of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was added to extract the viral RNA. The proportion of each virus was determined by qRT-PCR on extracted RNA using a mixture of Taqman probes labelled with two different fluorescent reporter dyes. MGB_CVB3_WT detects wild-type and 1-to-Stop viruses with the sequence CGCATCGTACCCATGG, and was labelled at the 5\u2032 end with a 6FAM dye; MGB_CVB3_Ref contains the four silent mutations, CGCTAGCTACCCATGG, and was labelled with a 5\u2032 VIC dye. Each 25 \u00b5l reaction contained 5 \u00b5l RNA, 900 nM of each primer (forward primer, 5\u2032-GATCGCATATGGTGATGATGTGA-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-AGCTTCAGCGAGTAAAGATGCA-3\u2032) and 150 nM of each probe. Using a known standard for the wild-type and reference virus during the qRT-PCR, we were able to calculate the RNA concentration for each viral variant with high sensitivity. The relative fitness was determined by the method described in the work by Carrasco et al. 16, 17 , using the RNA determinations for each virus. Briefly, the formula W = [R(t)/R(0)] 1/t represents the fitness W of each mutant genotype relative to the common competitor reference sequence, where R(0) and R(t) represent the ratio of mutant to reference virus densities in the inoculation mixture and at t days post-inoculation (1 day in this case), respectively. The fitness of the normal wild type to reference virus was 1.019, indicating no significant differences in fitness caused by the silent mutations engineered in the reference virus (competitor).",
