Volunteers providing healthcare may not always be trained or licensed health providers.7 In the absence of appropriate supervision, visiting medical students and residents may quickly over-reach their clinical abilities and may not fully understand select diseases or managerial approaches appropriate for a select region.8 Even experienced physicians without adequate preparation may quickly find themselves without the optimal procedural skills or appropriate knowledge base to provide quality service.8, 9 Different languages, local customs, and religious beliefs can pose barriers to well-intentioned healthcare delivery and community acceptance of public health measures.",

For patients and clinics without referral options, visiting providers must be able to acknowledge their limitations, uphold patient dignity, and provide comfort care measures.

Mayo, MD, summarized the inherent responsibility of medical providers and societies to work together.\nThe sum-total of medical knowledge is now so great and wide-spreading that it would be futile for one man to attempt to acquire, or for any one man to assume that he has, even a good working knowledge of any large part of the whole.
