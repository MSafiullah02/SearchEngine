We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 11, 2020, using the keywords \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, or \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d. We identified eight articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, none of these studies focused on characterising critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are at increased risk of death.\nAdded value of this study\nWe report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of 52 critically ill patients from 710 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. 35 (67%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop acute respiratory distress (ARDS; 26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 28 days is considerable. The survival time of non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n",

During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of critically ill patients exceeded the capacity of ICUs.

Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction.21 Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes.22, 23 Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia,2 suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital.5 The substantial difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO. In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation.14 The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China.24 At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.",

Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed.",
