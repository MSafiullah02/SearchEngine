            "text": "Recently, controversy concerning use of ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19 has arisen. The concern was initially expressed after an anecdotal report of 4 cases of worsening symptoms of COVID-19 in France that occurred after early treatment with ibuprofen in young people with no underlying health problems [1]. As a result, the WHO initially cautioned against the use of ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19. This initial recommendation was revised and now the European Medicines Agency and the WHO, citing the absence of clinical or population data, do not recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) be avoided when clinically indicated [2].",

However, aside from the direct anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDS, there are also indirect confounding factors when ibuprofen is used to reduce fever. In the situation of early viral illness, the use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the home environment is often as an antipyretic. Since fever has been observed in up to 99% of COVID-19 cases [4], many patients may self treat their discomfort of an elevated temperature with over the counter agents such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen thereby unwittingly interfere with the benefits of fever in the natural course of the disease.",

First, fever has been shown to be beneficial toward a reduction in the duration of viral illness and the mortality associated with illness [5]. Outside of reducing patient discomfort, there is little evidence to support administration of antipyretics to reduce fever results in better overall outcomes in previously healthy patients [6]. To the contrary, in several studies, the use of antipyretics has been associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity [7]. It is therefore a concern of whether these agents may suppress the natural mechanism of the body to fight infection.",

Meta analyses have also shown that ibuprofen has a larger temperature reduction effect compared to acetaminophen in children [9] and in adults [10].

Febrile temperatures have been shown to work as a systemic alert system activating the immune system during a challenge by invading pathogens [11]. Suppressing the fever response also blunts the associated hyperemic response, increased lymphocyte activity, and related oxygenation of organ tissues which leads to multiple organ failure in the COVID-19 patient. A recent study shows that COVID-19 proteins ORF8 and surface glycoproteins bind with the heme component of hemoglobin rendering it incapable of oxygen and CO2 transport resulting in hypoxemia [12]. A physiologic fact is also that oxygen is more easily unloaded from hemoglobin to deliver it to tissues in need when temperature is increased [13]\n",
