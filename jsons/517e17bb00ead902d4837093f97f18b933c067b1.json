For viral diseases, the most common antigen and route of vaccination are live attenuated or chemically inactivated whole viruses via parenteral injection. For diseases caused by bacteria, live attenuated or killed bacteria or outer membrane protein preparations elicit protective antibody responses when injected, given orally, or given intranasally (Bowersock and Martin 1999) . Recent developments of subunit or peptide vaccines by incorporation of known protective antigenic proteins and/or serologically dominant epitopes into DNA plasmids or mammalian viral-based vectors for delivery have prompted investigation into the use of plant expression systems for production of candidate animal vaccines (Streatfield and Howard 2003a) . In addition to the safety advantages through the reduced risk of contamination with animal or human pathogens, plant-based vaccines also offer the opportunity to deliver the vaccine cost-effectively and orally to large numbers of animals at the same time, thus saving time and the cost of immunizing animals individually by injection, as well as increasing client compliance, thereby contributing to overall herd health (Streatfield et al. 2001 ). There are new growth opportunities in veterinary applications of plant-based biologics, including vaccines and therapeutic products.",

Although CPMV containing the inserted epitope did not spread systemically in infected plants, the chimeric capsid protein isolated from plant protoplasts or inoculated leaves could be detected on Western blots using antiserum raised against the free homologous peptide. Since that time, optimization of the design of CPMV chimeric proteins has resulted in the expression of several FMDV epitopes (Porta et al. 2003) , thereby demonstrating that the plant viral CP could be used as a presentation system for FMDV epitopes.",

CPMV particles expressing the 3L17 linear epitopeof VP2 (Dalsgaard et al. 1997) were inactivated with UV light to remove the possibility of replication of the purified virus in a plant host after manufacture of the vaccine (Langeveld et al. 2001) . Parenteral vaccination with the inactivated virus was able to protect dogs from a lethal challenge with CPV. The dogs displayed no signs of clinical disease, did not shed CPV particles, and had high titers of peptide-specific neutralizing antibodies. Using the same experimental immunogen, combinations of systemic and mucosal routes for priming and boosting immunizations were tested for their influence on the immune response in mice (Nicholas et al. 2003) . Serum antibody responses were greatest in animals receiving subcutaneous prime and boosting; the response was least in mucosally vaccinated animals. The route of administration did not alter antibody ratios; intranasal administration following subcutaneous priming was effective in inducing mucosal IgA responses. These studies have implications for the development of effective immunization strategies using chimeric virus particles for protection against mucosally acquired viral infections.",

It remains a significant threat to human and animal health. Although rabies in humans is rare in the United States, as many as 18,000 Americans get rabies shots each year because they have been in contact with animals that may be rabid. In 1998, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only one person died of rabies in this country. In other parts of the world, however, many people die of rabies each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around the world more than 40,000 people die every year from rabies. WHO also estimates that 10 million people worldwide are treated after being exposed to animals that may have rabies (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/rabies.htm). The virus, which is in the saliva of infected animals, is usually transmitted by bites from infected animals. All warm-blooded animals can get rabies, and some may serve as natural reservoirs of the virus. Therefore, control of the infection in wild animals will reduce the risk of infection in humans and domesticated animals.",

To address this problem, an oral vaccination program using recombinant vaccinia virus containing the rabies antigen is incorporated into bait. A plant-derived vaccine could easily be incorporated into a bait. Management of rabies in other animals, including dogs, cats, ferrets, and livestock, involves parenteral injection of inactivated virus, necessitating the production of large quantities of rabies virus in cell culture.

It affects adult and young animals and is common worldwide. The herpes virion consists of a dense core that is covered by an icosohedral capsid. The structure is also covered by a lipid bilayer envelope with short glycoprotein spikes on the surface (Levy et al. 1994) . The genome is a double-stranded DNA that is linear but is in a circular form in the capsid. Several proteins are present on the surface of the virus particle, of which half are glycoproteins. Current vaccines for BHV-1 are formulated from inactivated or modified live virus and have the disadvantages of being poorly immunogenic or producing clinical disease if poorly inactivated, respectively. Alternative vaccination strategies using viral components, including glycoprotein D (gD) to induce protective immune responses, have been explored (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al. 1993) .",

It is caused by certain serotypes of enterotossimic Escherichia coli (0138, 0139, 0141) that are able to produce a powerful, Shiga-like toxin. The toxin damages the walls of small blood vessels, including those of the brain, and causes fluid, or edema, to accumulate in tissues of the stomach and the large bowel. Damage to blood vessels in the brain results in characteristic nervous signs. Flexible filaments, known as F18 fimbriae, are expressed by various strains of E. coli causing disease in humans and animals, and have been reported to be an important virulence factor related to edema (Rippinger et al. 1995) . The backbone of fimbriae consists of about 1,000 copies of a polypeptide that are arranged in an open helix. Colonization of pigs with the bacterial strains results in high levels of antifimbriae antibodies, especially IgA. As a result, there have been attempts made to vaccinate with the fimbrial proteins. Rossi et al. (2003) reported the isolation of the F18 fimbriae gene from genomic DNA of E. coli isolated from pigs that died of edema. The gene was cloned into plant transformation vectors, and transgenic tobacco seeds expressing up to 0.1% TSP of F18 adhesive fimbriae were produced. No animal tests were conducted in this study.

            "text": "Porcine Taenia solium , the pork tapeworm, is a long, flat, ribbon-like parasite that averages 6-10 feet long but can reach 30 feet in length. It causes a major parasitic disease known as taeniasis/cysticercosis that affects humans and pigs and is preva-lent in poor sanitary conditions and rustic rearing of pigs. Cysticerci (one stage of the life cycle) may localize in the central nervous system of humans, causing neurocysticercosis, a major health problem in developing countries. Pigs play the role of obligatory intermediate host in the life cycle of the parasite; therefore, control of the disease in pigs by vaccination may reduce human infection. A number of vaccines have been investigated, including the use of native or recombinant antigens, or peptides, derived from different stages of the tapeworm life cycle (Plancarte et al. 1999) . Three well-defined peptides of 18, 12, and 8 amino acids have been developed into a synthetic vaccine, SPvac, that is very effective under field conditions (Huerta et al. 2001) , but is costly to produce. In a search for less costly alternatives, Sciutto et al. (2002) engineered the peptides to be expressed in recombinant filamentous phage (M13) and in transgenic carrot and papaya plants. Candidate antigens were identified from cDNA expression libraries of a related parasite, T. crassiceps , by screening with sera from T. solium -cysticerci-infected pigs. Three peptides were identified from three of the expression products as being antigenic, and were shown to give high levels of protection in a mouse model. These protective peptides are distributed among the different life stages of the T. solium parasite. No data are yet available on expression levels in plants or effectiveness of the plantbased vaccine.",

Resulting tissue damage leads to pneumonia and death of animals. A recombinant derivative of Lkt, Lkt50, lacking the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains, was engineered as an N-terminal fusion with modified green fluorescent protein (mGFP) and containing an N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. This chimera was used to generate transgenic white clover ( Trifolium repens L.) expressing the chimeric protein from the CaMV 35S promoter at levels of 1% Lkt50-GFP (equivalent to 18 \u03bcg/g fresh weight tissue). Lkt-GFP-enriched fractions prepared from leaf extracts were able to induce an immune response to authentic Lkt in rabbits when delivered by intramuscular injection. The resulting antibodies were able to neutralize Lkt. According to the report, experiments are in progress to assess the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine in cattle and to test the efficacy of feeding the transgenic clover to cattle in stimulating a mucosal immune response to Lkt.",

Antibodies are induced against reproductive self-antigens present on the ZP, resulting in a reduction in fertility. Smith et al. (1997) proposed the use of oral, plant-derived immunocontraceptive vaccines for management of free-ranging wildlife species. In New Zealand, the introduced brushtail possum ( Trichosurus vulpecula ) causes major economic and environmental damage. In a recent report by Polkinghorne et al. (2005) , the feasibility of using a plant-based immunocontraceptive composed of recombinant antigens derived from the ZP for control of possums was investigated. Females injected with porcine ZP showed reduced fertility and production of anti-ZP antibodies. Recombinant antigens (glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3) from the ZP were cloned and expressed in bacteria; females injected with the purified proteins showed 75%-80% reduction in fertility. Although the recombinant ZP antigens have not yet been produced in a plant, female possums fed with transgenic potato tubers expressing the model antigen LT-B (heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin) (Mason et al. 1998 ) expressed systemic antibodies and antibody-secreting cells against LT-B. Future research includes the expression of the ZP antigens in trangenic carrot root and delivery of the vaccines in an oral bait.",
