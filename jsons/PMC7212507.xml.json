Accompanied by almost worldwide restrictions on movement and behavior this marks a true phenomenon of historic proportions. But what might be the consequence for the natural environment and its intimate relationship with human wellbeing? Short term this has been marked by incredibly rapid change in natural resource use, industrial and transport related emissions and wider greenhouse gases. Will these changes endure or at least leave some residual effect upon the way we live our lives and our relationship with the environment?",
