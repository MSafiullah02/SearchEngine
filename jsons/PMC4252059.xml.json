Mammalian miRNAs can bind to imperfectly complementary sites in the 3\u2032 noncoding regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target mRNAs and thereby act as specific post-transcriptional inhibitors of mRNA function [3]. The gene-silencing effect triggered by miRNAs may serve major function at two levels to modulate host\u2013virus interactions [4]\u2013[6]. On the one hand, cellular miRNAs target viral mRNAs in the defense against viral infection [7]. Secondly, several viral miRNAs regulate the expression of cellular factors that are involved in cellular innate responses that down-regulate the expression of key viral proteins [8], [9].",

The global prevalence of HSV-1 is approximately 90%. HSV-1 can establish lifelong persistent infection (latency). In response to a variety of stimuli, the virus can periodically reactivate to resume replication. The interactions of HSV-1 and its host cells, including miRNA regulation, contribute to the establishment of HSV-1 infection [11]. For example, HSV-1 uses viral miRNAs to down-regulate the immediate-early transactivators ICP0 and ICP4 in latently infected cells, most likely stabilizing the latent state [12]. Additionally, herpes simplex virus IE63 (ICP27) protein interacts with spliceosome-associated protein 145 and inhibits splicing to inhibit pre-mRNA processing during HSV-1 infections [13]. However, few studies focus on the regulation of cellular miRNAs [14].",

            "text": "MiR-23a is thought to have oncogenic effects via the modulation of cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis during the initiation and progression of human cancers [15]\u2013[17]. Dysregulation of miR-23a has been found in various human cancers, including tumors occurring in the breast, colon, and lung; gastric cancers; hepatocellular carcinoma; and acute myeloid leukemia [18]\u2013[23]. miR-23a regulates cell functions through modulation of target genes, such as transcription factor HOXB4 and metallothionein 2A [24], [25]. Recently, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which is involved in innate antiviral immunity, inflammation, and the pro-apoptotic pathway, was identified as a target of miR-23a to regulate cells growth and apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma [26]. We hypothesized that miR-23a may modulate viral-host interaction through IRF1. In this study, we found that miR-23a modulated the IRF1-mediated pathway to facilitate HSV-1 replication in HeLa cells, revealing that miRNAs play an important role in virus-host interaction during viral infection.",

Conversely, blocking miR-23a produced smaller plaques compared to the control vector (Fig. 1C). Then, we analyzed the concentration of viral progeny by a standard plaque assay. The results indicated that expression of miR-23a promoted viral replication, whereas down-regulation of miR-23a reduced or completely reversed the pro-virus effect (Fig. 1D). To further verify the role of miR-23a in virus replication, we quantified the concentration of infectious viruses in the supernatant. As in viral titers in cell, over-expression miR-23a showed the most viral replication (Fig. 1E). Thus, miR-23a may promote infection at the cellular level. miR-23a also increased the number of cells infected, as shown by the level of fluorescence, while blocking miR-23a had the opposite effect (Fig. 1F).

Fig. 6A showed that IRF1 significantly enhanced RSAD2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, ectopic expression of miR-23a caused the amount of RSAD2 mRNA and protein to decrease by about 40% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 6A). Next, we first constructed a RSAD2 expression vector (Myc-RSAD2), and verified the efficiency of the vector by Western blot (Fig. 6B). Plaque-formation assay and viral-titer assay to further explore the role of RSAD2 in HSV-1 replication was positive. (Fig. 6C, D).

But during late infection, the virus antagonizing the host's defense, and the virus antigen expression and replication may both induce miR-23a expression and other virus-promoting system to benefit its own infection.

For example, IRF1-dependent transcriptional activation of caspase 8 regulates the apoptotic pathway [45], and up-regulation of miR-23a permits anti-caspase-dependent apoptosis in several types of human cells [46], [47]. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurs in response to various stimuli, including virus infection. Viruses can modulate apoptotic pathways to enhance survival of the infected cell. For HSV-1, apoptosis is triggered by the transcription of immediate-early genes, such as ICP0 during infection [48]. And miRNA-dependent regulation generally involves a complex network. These suggest that miR-23a facilitates virus replication by down-regulating IRF1 mRNA to suppress RSAD2 expression and apoptosis.",

            "text": "But the mechanism responsible for the IRF1 suppressing HSV-1 replication is unclear. It is well known that IRF1 can stimulate both IFN I and IFN III system [49], [50]. Moreover, IRFI can activate many ISGs in an IFN-independent manner [51]. So both IFN system and IFN-independent pathway may be involved in anti-viral effect of IRF1 against HSV-1. Next, we choose RSAD2 or viperin for its recently reported effect on VSV. And as one of ISGs, it can be induced by both IFN-dependent pathway and directly by IRF1 [35]. Compared the result of fig. 3E and Fig. 6D, we can see that RSAD2 may partially account for the suppressing effect on HSV-1 by IRF1, although the anti-viral role of RSAD2 in IRF1 suppressing HSV-1 needs further investigation. Surprisingly, our finding was inconsistent with a recent study which showed that ectopically expressed RSAD2 could not inhibit the replication of wild type HSV-1 in HEK293T cells [52]. This may be due to different MOI used and different detection time, and more importantly, the replication cycle of HSV-1 in HeLa cells may be not the same as in HEK293T cells. The specific reason was under investigation. For the regulation of RSAD2 expression by IRF1, both IFN system and IFN-independent pathway may be involved, which needs further validation. Thus, IRF1 may suppress HSV replication partially by up-regulation of RSAD2 in both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent manner. We will explore the specific mechanism in the future.",
