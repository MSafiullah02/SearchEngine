            "text": " Pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents a complex and challenging dimension in the management of critically ill patients. Historically, the left heart was considered to be the only pump and the dominant force in the cardiovascular system, while the right heart was seen as a passive conduit through which blood flowed for reoxygenation. The function and importance of the right ventricle (RV) is now much better understood, largely due to the growing experience with right ventricular failure (RVF). Moreover, recent studies have identified RV function as a major determinant of outcomes including mortality, especially after myocardial infarction, in acute pulmonary embolism, and in moderate left heart failure [26]. In the intensive care unit (ICU), acute RV dysfunction has been well described with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and a decompensated RV, especially in those with chronic PH, portends limited survival [13]. Thus, early detection and treatment of PH and impending RVF can significantly improve outcomes. The RV differs from the left ventricle in both structure and function, and management of a failing RV is fundamentally different. Distinct etiologies for PH exist in the oncologic patient. The purpose of this chapter is to review the etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical features of PH in the oncologic patient, followed by a broad discussion of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management strategies, and prognosis for subsequent RVF in the critical care setting.",

A consideration should be made to switching oral PAH therapy to parenteral (inhaled or intravenous) ahead of time, as swallowing function and gut absorption may not be predictable perioperatively [23]. PAH patients carry a very large risk of mortality when surgery becomes emergent; and preoperative RV dysfunction, a higher NYHA functional class with worse exercise tolerance, and longer and more intricate surgery are associated with worse outcomes [68]. Induction of general anesthesia poses significant risks due to vasodilation and systemic hypotension, as well as adverse effects of positive pressure ventilation. Additively, surgery itself poses the usual risks, which patients with PAH are hemodynamically less equipped to tolerate. These surgical risks include fluid shifts, the need for continuous anesthetic use and neuromuscular blockade, and unfavorable positioning affecting lung volumes, all with resultant hypoventilation and hypoxemia that raise RV afterload [68]. In contrast, regional anesthetic techniques including nerve blocks and epidural anesthesia are better tolerated and preferentially recommended when possible [23].",

An important lesson from the current registries is the realization that subpopulations of PAH have significantly different outcomes and that overall survival has improved in the current era of new emerging treatments [58]. The prevalence of idiopathic (IPAH) and heritable PAH (HPAH) is estimated at 5\u201315 per one million in the general population [43, 52, 58], while European registries estimate prevalence of PAH at 5\u201352 per one million [2, 47, 66]. The mean age of patients with idiopathic PAH has risen from 36 years to a mean age at diagnosis between 50 and 65 years in the current registries. In addition, the usual female predominance is less certain among older patients. Presentation to the ICU with RVF due to undiagnosed PAH has become increasingly rare and can be explained by improved awareness and earlier recognition of PAH. Furthermore, the newer PAH therapies have stabilized outpatient PAH and may have improved survival; thus ICU admissions are now more frequently due to triggering factors than decompensated PAH itself.",

Sepsis can exacerbate the underfilled RV with a low effective intravascular volume. Subsequent initiation of mechanical ventilation further increases intrathoracic pressures and negatively affects venous return, and the effect may be augmented with high levels of PEEP. Conversely, factors that excessively increase venous return result in volume overload for the RV, leading to tension and possible ischemia of its free wall, stretching of the tricuspid valve annulus, and flattening and bowing of the IVS into the LV. Thus, the RV cardiac output decreases and negatively affects LV filling and cardiac output as well. Conditions that manifest with an increased RV preload include tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, atrial septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return, and states of overall volume overload such as renal failure or after resuscitation for shock. Myocardial depression and decreased LV contractility often occur with sepsis in part due to oxygen supply and demand mismatch [40] and in part because of the effects of circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha [8, 25]. As a result, the RV develops diastolic dysfunction as well as decreased contractility by the same mechanisms of myocyte hypoxia and circulating pro-inflammatory mediators. As sepsis resolves, both LV and RV function may normalize.",

In normal circumstances of increased oxygen demand, such as during exercise, the pulmonary circulation is able to both recruit and distend more vessels, thus realizing its great capacitance. Pulmonary blood flow and the ability to oxygenate are enhanced to match oxygen demand and rising systemic cardiac output. Conditions that affect the pulmonary circulation by increasing the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) include acute pulmonary embolism, RV outflow tract obstruction, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary stenosis, and all chronic forms of PH. Sepsis causes vasoactive, microthrombotic, and inflammatory damage to the pulmonary circulation, raising the PVR [68]. In the ICU, volume loss (atelectasis, consolidation, pleural effusions, mainstem intubation) and overdistension (dynamic hyperinflation, high tidal volumes or PEEP) as well as acidemia, hypercarbia, hypoxemia, and hypothermia may also raise the PVR [82]. Alveolar hypoxia leads to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, decreased nitric oxide (NO), and increased endothelin production in the pulmonary circulation, causing further local vasoconstriction [25] Lastly, disseminated intravascular coagulation, commonly part of sepsis, may cause microthrombi to form in the pulmonary arterial tree [9].",

In conditions of acute RV failure, such as during a massive PE, pressure in the pulmonary vascular bed rapidly increases, thus causing RV pressure to increase. Although the RV can dilate to accommodate the increased preload, its thin free wall precludes adequate acute adaptation to increased afterload. Once myocyte recruitment per the Frank-Starling mechanism has been maximized, any further increase in afterload will trigger a precipitous decrease in RV contractile function [27]. The dilated RV free wall experiences increased tension and ischemia, which further reduces free wall contractility. RV dilatation also results in stretching of the tricuspid annulus with subsequent tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The pericardial pressure also rises concurrently with the rising RV pressures and can constrain the cardiac chambers, further reducing their compliance, filling, and output [32].",

Its role in the ICU is indispensable in quick and noninvasive measurement of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), assessment of RV structure and function, estimation of volume status, evaluation of TR severity, evaluation of the pericardium, and search for causes of PH such as intracardiac shunts and left heart disease [60] (Table 2). Measuring the PASP depends on the peak TR jet Doppler velocity plus an estimate of the right atrial pressure [45]. An estimated PASP greater than 40 mmHg or a peak TR jet velocity \u22653 m/s is predictive of PH [45]. The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) should be about 2.4\u20132.7 cm, while values below 1.8 cm have been shown to correlate well with a decreased stroke volume index and RV ejection fraction, as well as increased hospitalizations for RHF and decreased survival in those with PAH [86]. Higher PASPs often imply that the PH is chronic, and the RV may have had time to hypertrophy, or there is acute-on-chronic PH. Dilation or hypokinesis of the RV or a flattened (or bowing) IVS suggests RV pressure and volume overload. Echocardiography also rules out or confirms pericardial effusion, measures cardiac chamber sizes, and may reveal constrictive physiology and/or the presence of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. ",

Sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome are notorious culprits of PH in the ICU. In patients with septic shock, empiric antimicrobial therapy and identification of infectious etiology are vital. Institution of high-flow oxygen or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may help stabilize patients with hypoxic or hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary embolism and hemodynamic compromise should be evaluated for systemic thrombolytics, and in nonresponders or those who cannot receive them, surgical embolectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, as well as mechanical circulatory support devices such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and right ventricular assist devices (RVAD) can be considered when appropriate [48, 56, 76, 88]. Ensuring that RV ischemia is not a result of an acute coronary syndrome is important since rapid revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention could be necessary to restore RV perfusion. Prompt cessation of any pharmacologic agents that may have precipitated PH, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy, anorexigens, or illicit drugs, is imperative. The use of steroids and/or nebulized therapy could be a part of the treatment for exacerbations of COPD or ILD. In cases of PAH therapy withdrawal, restarting pulmonary vasodilators is crucial. In those with suspected CTEPH, review with and/or referral to a specialized surgical center for consideration of pulmonary endarterectomy is imperative. Finally, continuous vigilance to correct metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia is vital to sustain RV contractility negatively affected by these factors.",

High-flow oxygen may be especially useful in avoiding or preventing intubation. In those with underlying lung disease or concomitant left heart dysfunction, noninvasive positive pressure therapy may help reduce the labor of breathing and improve ventilation. Positive airway pressure, however, can negatively affect RV function. In those with hemodynamic instability, altered mentation, or persistent hypoxemia, intubation with mechanical ventilation may be unavoidable despite its risks of significant metabolic and hemodynamic adverse effects. Hypotension with induction is common from sedating agents and neuromuscular blockade, and it may also occur from withdrawal of the potent sympathetic drive when work of breathing is relieved. Lastly, placing the patient in the supine position worsens hypoxemia through physiologic shunting. Therefore, in cases of decompensated PH and RVF, intubation should be avoided if at all possible. When intubation is necessary, precautions must be taken to prevent hypotension, acidosis, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia. Typically, medications that are considered relatively safe to use include opiates, benzodiazepines, etomidate, and ketamine at the lowest effective doses. If possible, propofol and paralysis should be avoided to prevent hypotension or, if needed, should be co-administered with a vasopressor empirically to prevent hypotension.

Attaining and maintaining optimal lung volumes is crucial as both overdistension and atelectasis of lung units increase the PVR. Atelectatic alveoli compress extra-alveolar vessels, resulting in an increase in PVR. Overdistension of alveoli compresses intra-alveolar vessels, still causing an increase in PVR [11].

As hypoxemia improves, PVR is reduced further. Inhaled NO can easily be administered in either ventilated or non-ventilated patients in doses of 10\u201340 ppm. NO is often used in severe ARDS and also perioperatively for cardiac surgery in heart failure.

Moreover, a large majority of targeted PAH medications that are revolutionizing outpatient PAH treatment are not indicated in the majority of patients with RVF without PAH. For those patients with chronic PAH, all chronic pulmonary vasodilator therapy should be resumed. In patients with decompensated PAH and RVF, intravenous or inhaled prostanoids should be emergently initiated, and ideally invasive monitoring should be started to guide titration based on hemodynamic measures. Concurrent inotropic support with dobutamine or dopamine, as well as vasopressor support with norepinephrine or vasopressin, may be necessary during this process to maintain hemodynamic stability. Targets of end-organ perfusion such as lactic acid, ScvO2, urine output, and liver function tests should also be serially monitored. Abrupt discontinuation of IV prostacyclin can lead to rapid deterioration from rebound PH; therefore interruptions should be carefully anticipated and avoided. Longer-acting analogues of prostacyclin (iloprost and treprostinil) can be administered through nebulization [10]. Inhaled milrinone has also been studied alone as well as in combination with inhaled prostacyclin in the context of cardiovascular surgery, but it is not widely used at this time [6, 16, 34].

Therefore, while necessary to improve forward flow through the pulmonary vasculature with inotropic agents, norepinephrine or vasopressin may be concurrently necessary to maintain an adequate SVR. Dobutamine is typically the first choice for inotropic support, but dopamine and milrinone are also options. All catecholamines carry a risk of causing or worsening tachycardia, and milrinone may also cause atrial arrhythmias. Aside from cases of concomitant left heart failure, digoxin does not have much of a role in the treatment of RVF. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer and phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, enhances cardiac contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen demand, but it may result in systemic and pulmonary vasodilation [68] and atrial arrhythmias. In a recent meta-analysis, levosimendan showed significant increase in TAPSE and ejection fraction, with decrease in PASP and PVR [69].",

Direct current cardioversion should be done early to restore normal sinus rhythm, ventricular filling, and cardiac output. Although amiodarone has a slower onset of action, it does not have negative inotropic effects, and is beneficial for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion. When an SVT involves the atrioventricular node, adenosine may be considered prior to cardioversion [68].

A keen understanding of the pathophysiology for PH and consequent RVF is imperative. A high clinical index of suspicion and systematic testing can help identify PH rapidly. Prompt management with continued escalation as needed, along with referral to a specialized center, is helpful. With the advent of new pulmonary vasodilator therapy and increased survival for those with PAH, familiarity with etiology, natural history, and available therapies for PAH is needed. As technologies and targeted therapies emerge, new etiologies and effects on the RV will continue to evolve.",

An acute event (A) triggers right ventricular pressure and volume overload and dysfunction (B), causing flattening of the interventricular septum (black arrow). Subsequently, the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure begins to rise, the right ventricle begins to dilate (C), and tricuspid regurgitation worsens. As the interventricular septum further bows into the left ventricle with concomitant pericardial constriction (pink arrows), the right ventricle becomes ischemic from decreased perfusion and begins to fail (D), dropping its cardiac output (blue arrow). The failing right ventricle then compromises left ventricular filling (E), causing rising left ventricular end-diastolic pressures and left ventricular failure. As systemic cardiac output drops (red arrow), ensuing hypotension results in multi-organ failure and possibly death.
