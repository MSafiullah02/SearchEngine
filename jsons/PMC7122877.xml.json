Infection with hMPV peaks in the late winter and spring in temperate climates (Williams et al. 2004; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. 2006) and in the late spring and summer in subtropical regions (Peiris et al. 2003). Infection with hMPV is most common in children younger than 2 years of age, and serological evidence of infection is present in most children by the age of 5. Reinfection in older children and adults typically results in milder disease (van den Hoogen et al. 2001; van den Hoogen et al. 2004b). By comparison to similar respiratory viruses, transmission is assumed to be through respiratory secretions and fomites (Crowe 2004). The virus has been shown to survive for a prolonged period in nonporous surfaces such as plastic and metal, making such surfaces a potential source for infection (Tollefson et al. 2010). Nosocomial transmission and outbreaks have been reported (Boivin et al. 2007; Cheng et al. 2007; Degail et al. 2012).",

There is conflicting data as to whether the hMPV lineages represent distinct serotypes (van den Hoogen et al. 2004a; Skiadopoulos et al. 2004). Both lineages appear to be globally distributed and circulate randomly during any given season (Boivin et al. 2004). hMPV has three surface glycoproteins: the fusion (F) protein, the attachment (G) protein, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins of unknown function. hMPV infection begins with attachment of the virus to respiratory epithelial cells. Attachment to the host cell appears to be mediated by nonspecific binding of the G protein to glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface (Thammawat et al. 2008) and by specific binding of the F protein to integrin receptors on the host cell (Cseke et al. 2009). This role of the F protein in cell attachment appears to be unique to hMPV among the paramyxoviruses.",

Children may present with an upper respiratory tract infection, evidence of bronchiolitis, including fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and diffuse wheezes and rales, or pneumonia, with dyspnea and localized infiltrates by chest x-ray. Systemic symptoms such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias may also be present (Williams et al. 2004, 2006, 2010). Symptoms may be severe, particularly in very young children, and require hospitalization and, in some instances, mechanical ventilation (van den Hoogen et al. 2001; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. 2006). hMPV is responsible for 4\u20136 % of hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections in young children (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2010; Boivin et al. 2003).",

Recombinant hMPV vaccines lacking the G and/or SH genes or the M gene (Biacchesi et al. 2004, 2005; Buchholz et al. 2005) or component proteins such as soluble hMPV F protein (Herfst and Fouchier 2008; Cseke et al. 2007) have shown promising results in animal studies.
