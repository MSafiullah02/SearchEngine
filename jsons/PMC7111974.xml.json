The disease, which resulted in 8098 cases with 774 deaths, was caused by a novel type of coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV, (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html). Patients with SARS usually developed a high fever followed by clinical symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease. In severe cases, the patients presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, and ultimately died (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b, Fowler et al., 2003, Wang and Chang, 2004). The hallmarks of severe cases of SARS included high viral titer, systemic infection, lymphopenia, and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (often referred to as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d) (Wong et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2005, Cameron et al., 2007). However, there has been no subsequent consensus regarding which treatment, if any, benefited SARS patients during the outbreak (Stockman et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The development of an effective treatment strategy for SARS cases will require clarifying the precise mechanisms by which host immune responses control SARS-CoV infection. Cumulative evidence suggests that patients who recovered from SARS possessed specific acquired immunity based on both T and B cells (Yang et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2007, Li et al., 2008, Fan et al., 2009). However, the effector cells or molecules that act to eliminate SARS-CoV during the acute phase of the infection remain unclear. As the extensive outbreak of SARS has not recurred since 2003, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes the pathogenesis and host immune responses has been investigated using adequate animal infectious models (Roberts et al., 2005, Roberts et al., 2007, Nagata et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2009, Zhao and Perlman, 2010). Lethal disease in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV, MA15, showed a lack of activation of innate immune response, resulting in a barely detectable antivirus T cell response (Zhao et al., 2009). On the other hand, aged BALB/c mice that were infected with a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) successfully eliminated the invasive virus within 1 week post-infection; these mice exhibited high and prolonged levels of viral replication, signs consistent with clinical symptoms, and pathologic changes in the lung resembling those seen in elderly SARS patients (Roberts et al., 2005). Therefore, the infection of these aged mice is considered a model for the successful elimination of SARS-CoV by host immune responses. A recent study reported that CD4+ T cells play an important role in the control of SARS-CoV infection (Chen et al., 2010). These researchers also reported an important role for innate defense mechanisms in controlling SARS-CoV infection, as demonstrated by the clearance of SARS-CoV over 9 days post-infection (dpi) in BALB/c mice depleted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Chen et al., 2010). These results suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for controlling SARS-CoV infection. Nonetheless, the identity and role of effector cells and molecules participating in the elimination of SARS-CoV during the acute phase of SARS remain largely unknown.",

            "text": "As a first step, we confirmed the time course of viral titers in the lungs of aged (>6 months old) BALB/c mice, young (7 weeks old) BALB/c mice, and young (8 weeks old) SCID mice following infection with SARS-CoV Vietnam/NB-04/2003. The intranasal (i.n.) infection of aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV resulted in over 108\n median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/g lung tissue at 2 dpi (\nFig. 1A). The infected mice exhibited histological signs of severe pneumonia, including interstitial cell thickening, immune cell infiltration, and epithelial damage in the bronchus, at 9 dpi and 21 dpi (Fig. 1B(c and d)). These results were similar to those of the previous reports that used another SARS-CoV strain such as the Urbani strain (Roberts et al., 2005). In the present work, SARS-CoV was detected in aged mice starting as early as 2 dpi (Fig. 1A). The observed titers in the aged-mouse model were considerably higher than those seen in infected young BALB/c mice, which did not show apparent histological signs of pneumonia (\nFig. 2B). Titers in the aged mice remained high (~107\n TCID50/g lung tissue) at 6 dpi (Fig. 1A). However, the titers decreased to levels below the lower limit of detection (LLOD; <1000 TCID50/g lung tissue) in the lungs of aged BALB/c mice and young BALB/c mice at 9 dpi (Fig. 1A). In contrast, young SCID mice, which lack functional T and B cells, were persistently infected with SARS-CoV during the experimental period (through 21 dpi, as shown in Fig. 1A). At this time, SCID mice did not exhibit histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 and 21 dpi, although a high viral titer was detected in the lungs of these animals during the experimental period (Fig. 1B(g and h) and C). Recently, Zhao and Perlman (2010) obtained similar results suggesting that a mouse-adapted mutant of SARS-CoV (viral strain MA15) persistently infected RAG1 knockout mice (C57BL/6 background), animals that also lack T and B cell populations. Taken together, these results suggested that the pathogenesis of SARS does not correlate with the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV. To investigate the effect of adaptive immune responses on clearance of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV, either na\u00efve splenocytes (obtained from BALB/c mice) or sensitized splenocytes (obtained from SARS-CoV-infected (9 dpi) BALB/c mice) were adoptively transplanted into na\u00efve SCID mice 1 day before SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 1D, the SCID mice that received na\u00efve splenocytes eliminated SARS-CoV from their lungs as early as the BALB/c mice did. The SCID mice transplanted with SARS-CoV-sensitized splenocytes of BALB/c mice eliminated SARS-CoV more rapidly than mice transplanted with na\u00efve splenocytes, although the initial pulmonary viral titers were effectively the same in all groups of SCID mice at 2 dpi, with or without the transfer of splenocytes. Only one of the SCID mice that received sensitized splenocytes showed detectable lung pulmonary viral titer (3.5\u00d7104\n TCID50/g lung) at 6 dpi; titers in the remaining 3 animals of this group (n=4/time point) were below the LLOD. The SCID mice transplanted with na\u00efve- or sensitized-splenocytes derived from aged BALB/c mice did not show histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 dpi, although infiltration of immunocompetent cells around bronchioles (arrows) was partially observed in the lung of both groups (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that induction of adaptive immune responses is essential for the clearance of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "To identify the host defense(s) involved in the elimination of SARS-CoV in the lung, we depleted CD4+ cells and/or CD8+ cells in BALB/c mice before and after SARS-CoV infection. Depletion of the CD4+ cells or CD8+ cells was performed by intravenous (i.v.) injection of (respectively) monoclonal antibody (mAb) GK1.5 or 53.6; control experiments demonstrated that injection of these mAbs produced virtually complete depletion of the corresponding cell populations (Fig. 1F). The CD4+ T cell-depleted BALB/c mice and the CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell-double-depleted BALB/c mice failed to eliminate the SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells by 9 dpi (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the CD8+ T cell-depleted BALB/c mice largely eliminated the SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells by 9 dpi (Fig. 1G). Recently, Chen et al. (2010) reported that both CD4+ T cells and neutralizing antibodies (following antibody response) play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells. However, it remains unclear whether the elimination of the virus in the present work and by Chen et al. (2010) reflects direct antiviral effect(s) by CD4+ T cells and/or B cells. Notably, several reports have demonstrated the presence of CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity during persistent viral infection, including infection by human immunodeficiency virus, human cytomegalovirus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Appay et al., 2002, Casazza et al., 2006, Landais et al., 2004). Furthermore, CD4+ T cell-mediated control of a \u03b3-herpes virus in B cell-deficient mice is mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (Christensen et al., 1999). In the present work, we found that SARS-CoV persistently infected the lung of nude (T cell-deficient) mice, as well as SCID mice (deficient of T cell and B cell), without inducing histological signs of pneumonia (Fig. 2A and B). Therefore, we investigated (using either of two models) whether CD4+ T cells could directly eliminate SARS-CoV via IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Our first model consisted of the adoptive transfer, 1 day before SARS-CoV infection, of CD4+ cells (1\u00d7107\n cells/mouse) from BALB/c mice into nude mice and SCID mice. The SCID mice that received the CD4+ T cell transfer did not eradicate SARS-CoV infection by 9 dpi (Fig. 2C). In contrast, nude mice that received the same quantity of CD4+ cells decreased the pulmonary viral titer below the LLOD between 6 and 9 dpi (Fig. 2D). For our second model, we investigated the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the elimination of SARS-CoV by using IFN-\u03b3-deficient mouse models. The IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice and the SCID mice that received splenocytes from IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice controlled the SARS-CoV infection as well as the wild-type mice did (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrated that CD4+ T cells are an essential cell type for the control of SARS-CoV infection, and that the effect of this cell fraction is indirect.",

Although the CD19+ cell-transplanted SCID mice (CD19+ cells; purity 98.3%) did not decrease the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer by 9 dpi, the SCID mice that had received a combination of both cell fractions (the CD19+ cell subset and the residual cell subsets (CD19\u2212 subsets containing T cells)) exhibited marked decreases in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer (to less than 1\u00d7104\n TCID50/g lung tissue;\nFig. 3A).

The decrease of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV titer in the anti-S protein antiserum-treated SCID mice was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for the detection of mRNA of the nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding gene of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3C).

As shown in Fig. 3B, administration of high-dose neutralizing Abs (NT50>300; 0.5 mL\u00d72 doses) eliminated SARS-CoV, although the antisera used were derived from other animal species. However, when BALB/c mice eradicated the SARS-CoV infection (9 dpi), the neutralization titer of antiserum from these BALB/c mice achieved an NT50 of 40\u201380 (Yasui et al., 2008). To investigate whether the neutralizing activity of Abs is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV infection, the SARS-CoV-infected SCID mice were administered i.p. at 6 dpi with lower doses of either mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum or rabbit anti-S protein antiserum. For this experiment, the neutralization titers of both mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum and rabbit anti-S protein antiserum were adjusted to NT50=40; mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum also was tested at NT50=13.3. As shown in Fig. 3D, the single injection (0.2 mL i.v., NT50=40) of mouse SARS-CoV antiserum, but not that of rabbit anti-S protein antiserum, reduced the pulmonary SARS-CoV titer. The single injection of mouse anti-SARS-CoV antiserum at an even lower neutralization titer (0.2 mL, NT50=13.3) also reduced the pulmonary virus titer by greater than 100-fold compared with that of untreated animals. Importantly, the SCID mice treated with rabbit anti-S protein antiserum did not eliminate SARS-CoV by 9 dpi, although the antisera of SCID mice treated with the rabbit antiserum clearly demonstrated neutralization activity against SARS-CoV (Fig. 3E). The inconsistency between the in vitro (neutralizing activity) and in vivo (clearance of pulmonary SARS-CoV) activities of the rabbit antiserum suggested that other effectors, besides anti-SARS-CoV Abs, also might be required to control SARS-CoV infection.",

We injected i.p. TM-\u03b21 (100 \u00b5L of ascites) into both SCID and BALB/c mice. Three days after TM-\u03b21 treatment, NK cell-depleted BALB/c mice splenocytes were transferred adoptively into NK cell-depleted SCID mice. The SCID mice were infected i.n. with SARS-CoV at 1 day after the splenocyte transfer. As shown in Fig. 4C, NK cells were considerably depleted in both the donor BALB/c mice (spleen) and the recipient SCID mice.

            "text": "Other blood cells also may serve as effectors for the control of SARS-CoV. Specifically, elevated levels of alveolar macrophages, monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages, and neutrophils were observed in many SARS patients (Nicholls et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003). While these three cell types have been implicated in SARS pathology, the role of these cell subsets in the control of SARS-CoV infection is still unknown. To investigate the role of these myeloid cells in the clearance of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary tissue, each subset of these myeloid cells was depleted by administration of a specific mAb or reagent. Consistent with previous reports (Pribul et al., 2008), alveolar macrophages were depleted for more than 5 days following i.n. administration of 100 \u03bcL of 30% clodronate liposome (\nFig. 5A). (Note that we used 30% clodronate liposome, thereby avoiding the intensive infiltration of neutrophils seen with administration of 100% clodronate liposome (Fig. 5A)). Neutrophils (CD11b+ and Ly-6Ghi) and Gr-1int monocytes in blood and lung were significantly depleted for at least 3 days after i.p. treatment with 250 \u03bcg of anti-Gr-1 mAb, whereas neutrophils alone were depleted upon administration of anti-Ly-6G mAb (1A8) (Fig. 5B and Daley et al., 2008). The Gr-1+ cell- and/or alveolar macrophage-depleted groups failed to eliminate the pulmonary SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 5C), whereas the alveolar macrophage-depleted group showed partial elimination of the virus. In contrast, the neutrophil-depleted BALB/c animals (anti-Ly-6G mAb-treated mice) eliminated SARS-CoV by 9 dpi (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the neutralizing Ab titer of these cell-depleted mice was comparable to that of untreated BALB/c mice (Fig. 5D, p=0.37). Similar results were obtained in murine anti-SARS-CoV antisera-treated SCID mice that were administered with clodronate liposome and/or anti-Gr-1 mAb (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that phagocytic cells, especially monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages, cooperate with anti-SARS-CoV Abs to provide control of SARS-CoV infection in these mouse models.",

            "text": "The outbreak of SARS in 2002\u20132003 resulted in over 8000 cases, with 10% mortality. The worst symptoms might correlate with age-dependent defects of immune response, given that mortality exceeded 50% in patients over 65 years of age (Peiris et al., 2004). A recent study using MA15-infected mouse models suggested that age-dependent increases of prostaglandin D2 expression in the lung may be associated with impaired immune response (Zhao et al., 2011). Retrospective analyses of recovered SARS patients suggests that patients who recovered from SARS possessed specific acquired immunity based on both T and B cells (Yang et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2007, Li et al., 2008, Fan et al., 2009). Notably, most patients who recover from SARS had elevated and sustained levels of neutralizing Abs, and patients with longer illnesses exhibited lower levels of neutralizing Abs than did patients with shorter durations of illness (Temperton et al., 2005, Ho et al., 2005). Previous studies revealed that passive transfer of immune serum to na\u00efve animals prevented SARS-CoV replication in the lower respiratory tract (Yang et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004, Kam et al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2007, Rockx et al., 2008, Rockx et al., 2011). Taken together, these results suggest that Ab responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV infection. Virus could be eradicated by direct binding of the virus by the neutralizing Abs and/or by cooperation between virus-specific Abs and other effector cells, including complement, NK cells, and phagocytic cells. However, the actual mechanism that controls the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection remained unclear.",

Therefore, it appears that the neutralization activity of Ab against SARS-CoV does not correlate with the clearance efficacy of the virus from infected murine lung. On the other hand, some other antibody property (such as avidity) may differ between the murine and rabbit antisera, given that the former is a polyclonal species derived from SARS-CoV-infected mice, while the latter was generated in rabbit against the S protein. Further study will be needed to resolve this distinction. In a Chinese hamster model of SARS, post-infection treatment (at 1 dpi) with 100 mg/kg of equine neutralizing F(ab\u05f3)2 resulted in only partial reduction of pulmonary viral titer, although prophylactic treatment at a 10-fold lower dose was sufficient to completely block SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2007). This result suggests that the anti-infective activity of a neutralizing Ab is mediated primarily via prevention of SARS-CoV invasion; the neutralizing Ab plays a lesser role in eliminating the virus after establishment of infection.",

            "text": "Therefore, we focused on the cooperation between anti-SARS-CoV Abs and other effectors in the control of SARS-CoV infection. Candidate effectors include complement (e.g., C3 and other members of the complement\u2013antibody complex pathway), NK cells (mediators of the Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway), and Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R)-bearing cells (notably alveolar macrophages, monocytes [monocytes-derived infiltrating macrophages], and neutrophils). A previous study reported that anti-Gr-1 mAb (RB6-8C5) recognizes not only neutrophils but also additional leukocyte populations, including monocytes (Daley et al., 2008). Therefore, we used both anti-Gr-1 mAb and neutrophil-specific mAb (anti-Ly-6G mAb) to discriminate monocytes and neutrophils. We tested the role of these candidates by selective depletion of a mouse infection model for various factors using CVF (complement depletion), anti-IL-2R\u03b2 mAb (TM-\u03b21; NK cell depletion), clodronate liposomes (alveolar macrophage depletion), anti-Gr-1 mAb (monocytes/neutrophil depletion), or anti-Ly6G mAb (neutrophil depletion) before or after SARS-CoV infection. Notably, the groups administered with clodronate liposome or anti-Gr-1 mAb, but not those treated with anti-Ly-6G mAb, failed to eliminate SARS-CoV from their lungs by 9 dpi. Our results indicated that phagocytic cells such as monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils, play a crucial role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-infected pulmonary cells in mice. Although little is known about host defense mechanisms in the acute phase of SARS clinical infection, infiltration of large numbers of macrophages into the lungs of SARS patients was observed (Nicholls et al., 2003, Franks et al., 2003). Those reports are consistent with our results, although further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism(s) of elimination of SARS-CoV via cooperation of phagocytic cells and SARS-CoV-specific antibodies.",

Zhao et al. also showed that the diminished virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses resulted from inefficient activation of alveolar macrophages and respiratory dendritic cells in lethal diseases (Zhao et al., 2009, Zhao et al., 2012, Zhao and Perlman, 2010). Their studies also demonstrated suboptimal responses of CD4+ T cell responses as well as CD8+ T cells, implying a critical role for antibody responsiveness in the MA15 infection model. In addition, while depletion of alveolar macrophages before MA15 infection completely protected mice from this lethal challenge, the depletion of alveolar macrophages at 2 days after MA15 infection appeared to exacerbate mortality (Zhao et al., 2009). Therefore, our findings would be rendered more persuasive by the inclusion of additional animal infection experiments using other patient isolates, such as the Urbani strain, and mouse-adapted strains, such as MA15, of SARS-CoV.",

Marked enhancement of the virus titer was reported in other respiratory virus infection models (Pribul et al., 2008, Tumpey et al., 2005). On the other hand, monocytes circulate throughout the body in anticipation of inflammation and infection. Murine monocytes are reported to comprise two distinct subpopulations with different phenotypes: CX3CR1loCCR2+Gr-1+ and CX3CR1hiCCR2-Gr-1\u2212 monocytes (Geissmann et al., 2003). On infiltration of the infection site, Gr-1+ inflammatory monocytes can give rise to various dendritic cells and macrophage types (Varol et al., 2009). Iijima et al. (2011) demonstrated that Gr-1+ monocyte-derived APCs are required to elicit IFN-\u03b3 secretion from effector Th1 cells, thus mediating host protection against HSV-2 infection. Lin et al. (2008) reported that monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages cause immune pathology rather than viral clearance during influenza virus infection. In contrast, Gr-1+ monocyte-derived cells are involved in the clearance of SARS-CoV infection, although the role of Gr-1+ monocyte-derived cells in the development of pathogenesis during SARS-CoV infection remains unknown.",
