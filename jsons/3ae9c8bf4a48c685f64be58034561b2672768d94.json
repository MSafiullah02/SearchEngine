Real costs of a response measure are difficult to estimate, which include both social costs and economic costs caused by reducing contacts, providing isolation spaces, investigating contacts of the infected, handing out mask, taking protective measures and so on. The economic and social benefit of containing an outbreak is also hard to quantify, as it will be dependent on the virulence and clinical severity of illness, and the productivity and economic loss due to closed schools and so on.
