In addition, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing\npathogen-specific antibodies may induce a number of immune mechanisms via the antibody\nFc region that result ultimately in the destruction and/or clearance of the pathogen or\npathogen-infected cells (Figure 1A). For the\nmost part, protective antibodies target epitopes that lie on the surface of the pathogen\n(e.g., the viral glycoprotein or bacterial capsid).",

For T-cell responses as well, some regions of an antigen may\nresult in more efficient expansion of T-cells than others. Issues of immunodominance are\nan important consideration for any vaccine design strategy, but particularly for peptide\nvaccines that focus on only a single or a few critical epitopes. A common strategy is to\nutilize naturally occurring antibodies or TCRs as a template for vaccine design,\nfollowing the logic that if a particular epitope has already elicited a B- or T-cell\nresponse during natural disease, then it is sufficiently immunogenic to allow induction\nof similar responses by administration of a vaccine. In other cases, epitopes that\nelicit an immune response most favorable for mitigating the disease may not be the most\nimmunodominant, and thus vaccination with critical epitopes may skew the immune response\nto yield protective responses. A good example of this is in HIV-1, where the vast\nmajority of antibodies that arise during natural infection target nonconserved or\nnon-neutralizing epitopes.4 A number of HIV-1 vaccine programs seek\nto focus the immune response on the most conserved epitopes, and those that represent\nsites of susceptibility for virus neutralization. Similar challenges confront\ndevelopment of broad vaccines for other viral pathogens such as influenza and dengue\nvirus.2,12 In\nsuch contexts, peptide-based vaccines may confer some advantage over vaccines consisting\nof larger protein sequences or whole inactivated virus as they are smaller and may\nelicit a more focused immune response toward critical neutralizing epitopes.21",

The X-ray structure of\nthe designed C1 immunogen bound to HCV1 closely resembled the mAb complexed with its\nnative linear epitope. Additionally, a bivalent E2-based antigen was designed, in which\nepitope I was engineered at another site of E2 (residues 625\u2013644). Mice vaccinated\nwith the designed immunogens produced a robust antibody response against epitope I that\ndemonstrated neutralization against HCV. Another strategy involving cyclic peptides to\nmimic HCV-envelope E2 was recently employed58 that demonstrated that\ncyclic epitope mimics of epitope II of the HCV E2 protein, and not their linear\ncounterparts, demonstrated specificity for neutralizing mAb HC84.1.59,60",

Emerging evidence suggests that soluble\nprefibrillar species are the most neurotoxic, but the intrinsic heterogeneity and\nmetastability of these oligomers have impeded structural studies. The structure of a\nmonomeric A\u03b2 fragment in complex with an affibody protein,90\ndetermined by NMR, revealed a \u03b2-hairpin comprising residues 17\u201336 (Figure 7C). How different A\u03b2 species contribute\nto the neurotoxicity observed in AD remains largely unknown. It has been shown that\nA\u03b2 oligomers can form \u03b2-barrel pores in a membrane environment, suggesting\nthat disruption of the plasma membrane may be one mechanism by which A\u03b2 oligomers\ncause toxicity.91 Large nonfibril assemblies formed by A\u03b2-like\npeptides designed to adopt well-defined oligomers have also been visualized by X-ray\ncrystallography and contain pore-like features.92,93 The diversity of A\u03b2 species has emerged as an\nimportant challenge in the development of A\u03b2-targeted therapeutics.94",

Six isoforms exist in\nthe brain, all of which are formed by alternative splicing of the microtubule-associated\nprotein Tau (MAPT) gene. Tau is post-translationally modified, including \u223c80\npossible phosphorylation sites that are targets of a diverse array of kinases and\nphosphatases. Hyperphosphorylation as well as truncation of Tau are thought to contribute\nto the misfolding and subsequent fibril formation observed in AD. Structurally, Tau\nfilaments have been studied by cryo-electron microscopy.96 The core Tau\nfilament is composed of residues 306\u2013378 of Tau, forming a combined\ncross-\u03b2/\u03b2-helix structure of two protofilaments (paired helical and straight\nfilaments, Figure 8). Tau lesions are closely\ncorrelated with the degree of neurodegeneration in AD,97 which supports\nits potential as a therapeutic target. Moreover, the distribution of NFTs defines clinical\nsubtypes of AD, and NFTs precede A\u03b2 plaque formation. The diversity of physiologic\nand pathogenic Tau isoforms and modification has been a longstanding challenge in the\ndesign of Tau-targeting agents as potential AD therapies. Nonetheless, different\nstrategies to specifically target pathological Tau species are under investigation.",

Paradoxically, the major FR-\u03b1 isoform, with the\nexception of placental, is mostly expressed at the apical (luminal) surface of epithelial\ncells, which is not in direct contact with circulating folate.120 Under\nnormal cellular conditions, the FR-\u03b1 expression level is low and is restricted to\nvarious epithelial cells, including those in the kidney proximal tubule, placenta, breast,\nchoroid plexus, lung, salivary glands, and female reproductive tract.121\u2212123 The role of folate in cancer is not well understood and\nappears to have different effects depending on the circumstances.

            "text": "The examples discussed herein show how peptides can be harnessed to manipulate the immune\nsystem for prophylactic or therapeutic benefit. Like all vaccines, a continual challenge\nwith peptide vaccines stems from the fact that immune responses are still very difficult to\npredict. Thus, the development of optimal immunogens often requires a laborious\ntrial-and-error process of animal immunizations followed by characterization of resulting\nimmune responses. Even with this, there can often be species differences, and thus what\nworks in a mouse may not work in a primate. Still, recent efforts in both structure-based\nimmunogen design as well as de novo analysis of TCR specificities have provided a few\nshining examples of success. There is increasing evidence that the structure of peptide\nB-cell epitopes can be important for eliciting antibodies of desired function (e.g.,\nneutralizing activity), and thus methods aimed at stabilizing or presenting peptide epitopes\nin conformationally relevant contexts are likely to improve the success of vaccines that aim\nto elicit antibody responses. For infectious disease, this may be especially important in\nthe context of neutralizing epitopes where function of the epitope is often tied to its\nthree-dimensional structure. For Alzheimer\u2019s disease, targeting the appropriate\npathologic oligomeric state of A\u03b2 or Tau may prove to be an important factor for\nnext-generation immunotherapies or vaccines.",

In this case, many of the\npeptide epitopes can be assessed in vitro utilizing peptide\u2013MHC complexes or using\nHLA-presenting cells and T-cells. An exciting prospect is that this strategy could be scaled\nup into a personalized therapeutic approach whereby each patient\u2019s tumor or TILs are\nsequenced, and then patient-specific peptide vaccines or peptide-stimulated adoptive cell\ntherapies are generated then utilized. Potentially, this strategy could provide greater\nefficacy than a general approach, such as global upregulation of T-cells (e.g., checkpoint\ninhibitors), as there is the potential to activate endogenous antitumor responses.",

            "text": "Finally, a likely continued major challenge for peptide vaccines will be the weaker overall\nimmune response that subunit vaccines tend to elicit in comparison to vaccines that contain\ninactivated or attenuated pathogen. While this issue is of particular relevance in\ninfectious diseases, it may also pertain to other disease areas as well, because stronger\nimmune responses can often be associated with greater protection and durability. There are a\nnumber of exciting technologies with potential to overcome this challenge, such as the\ndevelopment of peptide-presenting nanoparticles. However, additional research into this area\nis warranted. One approach that we have not discussed here, but that has been successful for\nlarger subunit vaccines, is delivery not of the protein itself, but of the genetic material\nthat encodes the protein via liposome-delivered mRNA, in vivo electroporation, or\nadeno-associated virus (AAV). In this case, the immunogen is produced by the host (typically\nmuscle cells), and thus the immune response can be greater because of the sustained level of\nimmunogen. Whether or not this paradigm could be adapted to peptide-based immunogens remains\nto be determined but is an exciting proposition.",
