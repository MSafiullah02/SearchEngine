Three different genotype members of Human bocavirus, HBoV2, 3 and 4, have been discovered subsequently in fecal specimens. The HBoV1 virus is the most frequently identified pathogen worldwide with infection rates ranging from 2% to 22% in respiratory specimens from children under 2 years old with acute respiratory illnesses, often showing a high presence of co-infection with other respiratory viruses [7-19]. One of the most frequently observed clinical symptoms in HBoV1-infected patients is acute wheezing [20,21]. However, Vicenti et al. [22] reported the detection of HBoV1 in stool samples from children under 3 years old with acute gastroenteritis without respiratory tract disease and Mitui et al. [23] detected HBoV1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of children with encephalitis. Therefore, the role of HBoV1 in disease requires further investigation.",

            "text": "HBoV1 is a linear, single-stranded DNA virus with a genome of about 5400 nt. Recently, Huang et al. [24] obtained the sequence of a full-length HBoV1 genome (including both termini) and demonstrated that this HBoV1 plasmid replicated and produced viruses in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Based on HBoV1 DNA sequences detected in HBoV1-positive clinical samples, L\u00fcsebrink et al. [25] proposed that HBoV1 may have a different replication mechanism than parvoviruses in general. In the HBoV1 genome, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding non-structural protein NS1, and capsid proteins VP1 and overlapping VP2, respectively. An additional mid-ORF is thought to encode the non-structural protein NP1 with an unknown function. All mRNAs of HBoV1 are transcribed from a single promoter located near the 5'-terminus of the viral genome [26], similar to that of the closely related BPV and MVC. Recently, a comprehensive transcription profile of HBoV1 by transfecting a replicative chimeric HBoV1 genome in 293 cells and a non-replicative genome in human lung epithelial A549 cells was generated and the expression profiles of both the structural and non-structural proteins of HBoV1 were studied in detail [27].",

            "text": "The non-structural NS1 protein of parvovirus is central to the viral life cycle and plays multiple roles, mediating viral genome transcription, replication, and packaging. The NS1 protein of parvovirus B19 is essential for the activation of the B19 p6 promoter [28] and has a positive feedback effect on the activity of the p6 promoter [29]. Raab et al. [30] demonstrated that B19-NS1 protein interacted with the p6 promoter by direct DNA binding to cellular transcription factors Sp1/Sp3. The P38 promoter of the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVMp) is strongly trans-activated by the nonstructural protein NS1, which interacts with the cellular transcription factors SP1, TFIIA(\u03b1/\u03b2) and TBP in vitro [31-35]. The transcripts encoding the NS1 of HBoV1 which are either spliced or unspliced resulted in respectively a large nonstructural protein NS1 of approximately 100 kDa comparable to the NS1 of MVC and BPV1, and a relatively small nonstructural protein NS1-70 of approximately 70 kDa [27]. However, the functions of HBoV1-NS1 protein have not been characterized yet.",

Green fluorescence was detected in all cells transfected with the vector containing the EGFP gene under the control of the HBoV1 promoter (Figure 2). Compared to control transfections with pGL3-pCMV, fluorescence was slightly stronger in cells transfected with pGL3-Bov-EGFP.

After transfection of HeLa cells with these constructs, luciferase activity was measured as described in the Methods section. Results indicated that the full promoter P1 and some 5'-terminus truncated promoters, including constructs P2, P3 and P4, showed almost the same activity, suggesting that the sequences from nt 1\u201395 were not critical for the promoter activity (Figure 5). When the sequences of the 5'-terminus were further deleted to reach the position at nt 128 (P5) and nt 145 (P6), promoter activity decreased by 34% and 62%, respectively, compared to the full promoter P1. These results suggested that the putative transcription factor binding region, located from nt 96 to nt 145, may be important for transcriptional activity. The core promoter region from nt 146 to nt 196 was suggested by promoter prediction software analysis [26]. However, the construct P8, although containing the purported promoter Ins and TATA box key elements, showed activity nearly at background level. When 17 bp sequences upstream of the core promoter remained to yield the construct P7, which contained the CAAT box, the promoter activity was increased almost 105-fold compared to the P8 construct. These data suggested that the additional upstream sequences of the core promoter appeared to be required for the HBoV1 promoter activity.",

In the present study, 33 of 941 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (3.51%) were positive for HBoV1 (data not shown). Next, we constructed a nearly full-length genome clone without ITR structures at the termini, which resembled genotype HBoV1, as established by DNA sequence alignment. The region of the full promoter from nt 1 to 252, the sole promoter in the viral genome [26,27], including the translation initiation codon of the NS1 gene, was amplified by PCR using plasmid pWHL-1 as a template and cloned into the pBluescript II vector. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the essential elements of the promoter, including TATA-box, CAAT-box, and Ins were present in this region. The full promoter construct was transfected into four human cell lines to examine whether the unique viral promoter is active in mammalian cell lines. The results showed that the promoter was highly active not only in all tested human cell lines, but also in other mammalian cells such as porcine and rabbit cells. Furthermore, in 293 T and HeLa cells, the activity of the HBoV1 promoter even exceeded that of the CMV promoter which is well known to be a highly active in eukaryotic cells. However, the HBoV1 promoter was not functional in the insect Sf9 cell line (data not shown). In our recent study, NS1 transcripts from the left-hand of the viral genome were detected in pWHL-1 transfected 293 T cells and other mammalian cells including HeLa, A549, WI-38 cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that this promoter is unique and active in most mammalian cells. The HBoV1 promoter may become an attractive choice when a strong promoter is needed in a variety of vertebrate cells. No viral DNA replication was detected by the Southern-blot method (data not shown) in cells transfected with the pWHL-1 plasmid implicating that ITRs were essential for viral DNA replication during infection.",

The core promoter (P8) including Ins and TATA box exhibited low activity and a mutant of the TATA motif had no effect on the promoter activity. These results indicated that the TATA box in the HBoV1 promoter is not required for promoter activity. However, upon addition of upstream sequence to include the regulatory element CAAT box (P7), promoter activity increased. Mutations in the CAAT box had also an effect on the promoter activity. The promoter activity diminished dramatically when the sequences from nt 96 to nt 145 were deleted, demonstrating that it contained key transcription regulatory elements.

The NS1 of human parvovirus B19 has been shown to trans-activate the p6 promoter [29]. Chen et al. reported that the NS1 protein of HBoV1 was also localized in the nucleus [27], however, the role of HBoV1 NS1 protein has not been characterized. We therefore examined the effect of the NS1 protein on the HBoV1 promoter and found that this protein activated in trans the activity of the promoter in 293 T and HeLa cells. It is possible that the NS1 protein functions through binding to the promoter region or, indirectly, by interacting with host transcription factors. Deletion of the DNA elements, such as an ATF/CREB consensus site, of the P6 promoter in B19, led to a great reduction of trans-activation by NS1 to only 30% of that of the wild-type promoter [36]. A sequence element similar to the CREB site is also present within the HBoV1 promoter region: 5'-TGACGTAT-3' (nt 118\u2013125), which is proximal to the TATA box and may be a putative site for binding by the NS1 protein (Figure 1). In summary, this work provides a framework for further characterization of the promoter and study of the mechanism of transcription and expression of the viral genome. Further investigation is needed to elucidate trans-activation mechanisms by viral nonstructural proteins and cellular transcription factors.",

Truncated promoter fragments were created by PCR amplification of the respective segments with plasmid pWHL-1 and pEGFP-N1 as templates. The HBoV1 promoter (nt 1\u2013252) and the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV-IE) promoter were cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Beijing, China) to result in pGL3-(1\u2013252)/P1 and pGL3-pCMV, respectively. The construct pGL3-(1\u2013252)/P1 was used subsequently as a template for generation of a series of truncated mutants of the HBoV1 promoter by PCR. These mutants were designated as pGL3-(32\u2013252)/P2, pGL3-(64\u2013252)/P3, pGL3-(96\u2013252)/P4, pGL3-(128\u2013252)/P5, pGL3-(145\u2013252)/P6, pGL3-(128\u2013196)/P7 and pGL3-(145\u2013196)/P8 respectively (Figure 4). The substitution mutant pGL3-(CREBmut) was made by PCR-based mutagenesis from pGL3-(1\u2013252), whereby the sequence TGACG motif at nt 118 was mutated to TCAAT. Similarly, in the mutant pGL3-(CAATmut), the initiator sequence at nt 131 was mutated from CCAAT to TTAAT; in the mutant pGL3-(CdxAmut), the initiator sequence at nt 146 was mutated from TATT to GAGG; and in the mutant pGL3-(TATAmut), the initiator sequence at nt 155 was mutated from TATAT to GAGAG (Figure 6). pGL3-Bov-EGFP and pGL3-pCMV-NS1 plasmids were constructed by replacing the luciferase gene with the GFP gene of the pGL3-(1\u2013252) and the luciferase gene with the HBoV1 NS1 gene (nt 253\u20132172) of pGL3-pCMV vector, respectively. The NS1 mutant plasmid, designated pGL3-pCMV-NS1mut, was constructed by mutating the start codon ATG to TAA.

(A) The luciferase activity of the construct pGL3-(1\u2013252) in 293 T and HeLa cells in the presence of the NS1 expression. Cells co-transfected with pGL3-(1\u2013252) and mNS1 constructs in the absence of the NS1 were used as controls. The relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio between the pGL3-(1\u2013252) activity and the control plasmid pRL-TK activity. The error bars indicate standard deviations of three independent experiments and each was performed in triplicate. (B) Detection of the NS1 protein in cells co-transfected with pGL3-(1\u2013252) and WT-NS1 constructs by Western blot assay. Actin was used as a loading control.
