These simulations, in turn, have been used to predict parameters for electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis such as electron and x-ray ranges and backscattered electron yields. Monte Carlo techniques have also been used to predict analytical behavior in unconventional specimens, such as thin films and particles (e.g., relative intensity as a function of particle size). However, because of limitations in the physical models and lengthy calculations involved, Monte Carlo techniques have only very rarely been applied to actually correct quantitative analysis data.",

By using a simple but accurate numerical approximation for the relative elastic scattering cross section as a function of Z and E, it is possible to develop Monte Carlo procedures to calculate trajectories in multiple-element samples with the same speed as for single element standards. Modern expressions for the ionization cross section and the electron energy loss (particularly at low energies) have significantly improved the agreement between Monte Carlo calculations and experimentally-measured data. Monte Carlo algorithms that produce the same level of accuracy in correcting conventional electron microbeam analyses of thick, polished specimens and thin films are the best of the currently used correction procedures, and are of superior accuracy in the analysis of small particles and samples at multiple accelerating potentials. By combining polynomial a-factors with Monte Carlo-based algorithms in an iterative correction scheme, it is now possible with a fast desktop, PCtype computer to perform practical, online, Monte Carlo data processing.

Massively parallel supercomputers with multiple-instruction multiple-data (MIMD) architecture are a good platform for Monte Carlo electron trajectory codes without the complications of vectorization of the computer code required on vector supercomputers (e.g., CRAY-YMP). The NIST Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulation code has been adapted to run on a massively parallel computer. For the first time, the increased speed of the calculations has made Monte Carlo calculations a real-time tool for data interpretation. The increased speed achieved by the parallelization of the Monte Carlo code results in the ability to model small probability events due to the massively parallel Monte Carlo (MPMC) code's ability to simulate large numbers of electron trajectories quickly. Applications include both thin-film and bulk x-ray microanalysis and examples of contrast in backscattered electron images obtained in the SEM.

While generally a minor contribution to the total x-ray emission, secondary x-ray fluorescence can become an important issue, when the spatial resolution of analysis is of interest, because of the significantly greater range of x-rays than of electrons. Thus, for a nickel-10% iron alloy excited with a 15 keV electron beam, the range of excitation of the primary radiation will be a hemispheric volume with a diameter of about one micrometer, while the range of secondary fluorescence of iron K-shell radiation by nickel K-shell radiation will be a hemispheric volume with a diameter of approximately 60 micrometers for 90% of the total secondary radiation. Such long-range production of secondary radiation is important when the measurement of trace element distributions near phase boundaries is attempted in situations where an analyte appears at high concentration across the boundary.",

The most simple model is the one which uses the inelastic mean free path. This model is applied, for example, to spectroscopic analyses of elastically reflected electrons, Auger electrons, and photoelectrons. The most popular model is the single scattering model in which the step length is taking the free path of elastic scattering of electrons, and an energy loss during their traveling is calculated by the continuous slowing-down approximation of Bethe, [dE/ds] Bethe . The most complicated model is the direct simulation model in which all inelastic interactions are taken into consideration as the discrete process. This model requires all differential cross sections for inelastic scattering and, thus, a long computational time. The last one, a compromise model, is the hybrid model which introduces partially the discrete process of inelastic scattering. In the model the continuous energy loss [dE/ds] (1) where [dE/ds] dis includes both energy losses due to core electron ionization and valence electron excitation. A variety of the cross sections has been used for inelastic scattering. The fast secondary production model uses the Moller equation for the cross section, assuming that all atomic electrons are free (Murata et al. 1981 ).",

Agreement is good. Also shown is the result without the discrete processes of inelastic scattering. An appreciable deviation is seen in the vicinity of the peak.

For about half the elements in the periodic table, no experimental values ever appear to have been published, and data are conspicuously absent for even the most common alloys and compounds.

Thus, unless a major source of quantitative results has been overlooked, it is fair to conclude that the experimental data presently available are not good enough to allow the merits of competing Monte Carlo models to be judged, or even to permit specific numerical comparisons (e.g., the backscattered yield of carbon, copper, and gold at 5 keV) to be made with any satisfactory level of certainty.

Biochemical analyses using tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting with GSL II showed the GlcNAc-containing glycoproteins to be insoluble, with molecular masses ranging from 15 to 30 kD. Having available specific markers for the three major glial cell groups, we were able to combine lectin histochemistry with immunohistochemistry to perform double-labeling studies demonstrating specificity of each stain for a given glial cell type.",

It became immediately ap-parent that microglial cells were the major glial cell type responding to neuron injury. Microglia not only proliferate and change their morphology in response to CNS damage, but they can also vary their membrane phenotype by expressing new molecules on their surface. We found that antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which are largely absent from the normal CNS, are expressed de novo on microglia and related perivascular cells responding to neuron injury. Our studies, which have included various neuropathologic conditions including stroke and brain tumors, have shown that the expression of MHC antigens, as well as other related immunomolecules, is always restricted to cells of the microglial lineage. These findings strongly suggest a role for microglia as indigenous immunocompetent cells of the CNS.",

LOWNEY National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA A scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to measure the dimensions of the microlithographic features of integrated circuits. However, without a good model of the electron-beam/specimen interaction, accurate edge location cannot be obtained. A Monte Carlo code has been developed to model the interaction of an electron beam with lines lithographically produced on a multilayer substrate. The purpose of the code is to enable one to extract the edge position of a line from SEM measurements. It is based on prior codes developed at NIST 1 but with a new formulation for the atomic scattering cross sections and the inclusion of a method to simulate edge roughness or rounding. The code is currently able to model transmitted and backscattered electrons, and the results from the code have been applied to the analysis of electron transmission through gold lines on a thin silicon substrate, such as used in an x-ray lithographic mask. There is provision for both transmitted and backscattered electron detectors. By comparing the predictions of the code with measured data, it is possible to obtain edge positions to the order of 10 nm, which is needed for the advanced lithography projected for the year 2000. 2 The uncertainty of these measurements is limited by the sample geometry and surface roughness and not by the measurement process.",

The three layers that form the substrate, which are typical of an x-ray mask membrane, are silicon, polyamide, and chromium. The lithographically produced lines are gold, and the chromium improves adherence of the lines to the substrate. The code is easily modified to model other media by simply changing the atomic parameters in the input subroutine.

Direct comparisons with measured transmission through an x-ray mask of gold on a silicon membrane can be used to demonstrate the determination of the edge of the gold line. Figure 1 shows the transmission (measured downward) along the axis of a gold line indicating the plateaus in the data near the middle of the edges. 3 Figure 2 shows a simulation of the data with the plateaus at nearly the same location along the edges as in the data. This work shows how high-resolution metrology of the features produced by advanced lithography can be obtained with an SEM.

Joy (J Microsc, 147, 52, 1987) , which is extended to account for the regions near the corners of the line profile. Furthermore, the recollection of SE by the sample is accounted for. As a result, realistic pure SE profiles are generated. The primary beam parameters include the probe size and the depth of focus. Determination of the top and bottom linewidths via the commonly used heuristic algorithms reveals the systematic errors of these methods. A simple example is the probe size dependence of the peak-to-peak width, which can be related to the strong asymmetry of these peaks. We expect that improved algorithms can be developed, which use a modest database acquired by Monte Carlo simulation. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) fitted with a helium-neon laser interferometer is used to measure the widths of features on photomasks. In this way the magnification of the SEM can be known very precisely. Algorithms yielding good measurement repeatability, which use the back-scattered electron (BSE) signal, have been developed (Nunn 1990, Nunn and Turner 1989) but in order to be able to relate measurements made on the image to the physical dimensions of the artefact, it has been necessary to model the image formation process.",

Intensity ond phase rather than the size distribution, but for more realistic microstructural geometries such a calculation would be useful in determining the presence of alternative phases in a complex assemblage. terference microscopy 1-6 is based on the observation that a simple single-arm interferometer can be constructed by allowing light from a laser to be back-reflected from a target and to reenter the laser resonant cavity to produce a modulation of the laser light-intensity. [7] [8] [9] The resultant light modulation is dependent on the optical phase (optical path length traveled) and amplitude of the reentry light. If the target is moved over several wavelengths, the laser light intensity displays a cos(z) dependence; for a mirror target, the light modulation index (I-I o /I+I o ) can be as great as 0.75. These observations were denoted as laser-feedback interferometry (LFI); 9 this phenomenon has been characterized and analyzed several times in the past 30 years. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The theory of LFI 2, 11, 17 provides an understanding of the harmonic content of LFI signals; they follow a Bessel-function dependence, a property that is useful in designing electronic feedback circuits necessary to produce a practical laser-feedback microscope. LFI can employ either diode or gas lasers as the interactive laser source/detector. Using a He-Ne laser with a high-reflectivity output coupler mirror (\u2264 98%), it is possible to measure surface profiles of highly-reflecting surfaces (e.g., metals or high index-of-refraction materials such as silicon) with axial detail as small as 1 nm and surface vibrations up to 1-2 MHz can be measured down to picometer amplitudes. In addition, weakly backscattering materials (e.g., biological cell surfaces and cell components) give sufficient signals to provide a useful method of high-resolution imaging in biology.",

Axial (z) motion, furnished by a tubular piezoelectric transducer, provides both a modulation signal input for the electronic feedback circuit (25 kHz) and repositions the sample at each point. The electronic feedback circuit maintains a fixed distance between the output coupler mirror of the laser and a point in the object being imaged. The correction (output) signal of the feedback circuit then gives a measure of the surface topography of the sample. Concomitantly, the laser intensity modulation gives a measure of the surface reflectivity of each point on the sample. These two images are digitized and stored in the computer memory. All microscope control functions have been consolidated in a dedicated small computer allowing samples to be run without interruption by the resetting or realignment of the microscope. PHOEBE scans for biological use range from 10 \u00b5m \u00d7 10 \u00b5m to 120 \u00b5m \u00d7 120 \u00b5m.

Although the diffusion effect in NMR has been studied extensively, the effect on NMR microscopy has not as yet been observed experimentally due to the current limitations of the NMR microscope. Theory, however, suggests substantial resolution broadening in NMR microscopy if molecular self-diffusion prevails, especially when we deal with molecules with large diffusion coefficients. Resolution limits on NMR microscopy especially include diffusion limits, namely, effects of phase variation due to molecular self-diffusion during data acquisition, effects of signal attenuation and related line broadening, and some diffusion effects of molecules which, when confined in boundaries or walls, exhibit anomalies in resolution observation in NMR microscopy. The first two are based on free-water molecules, while the third is based on the model of water molecules confined by boundaries, which have significant physical consequences. Diffusion effects limit resolution in microscopic imaging, as does the phase factor which is related to the finite bandwidth of the imaging instrumentation: that is, the available gradient strength and acquisition time, both of which are intimately related to the diffusion effect.",

High pressure freezing (HPF) reduces ice segregation in suitable specimens (e.g., thin plant leaves or rigid tissues such as cartilage). The main problem of HPF in soft tissues results from the indispensable dividing of the specimens into small pieces. Impact freezing on a metal mirror (MMF) is well suited for suspensions such as HPF or double jet (DJF), but MMF has an advantage for soft tissues, since it is suitable for larger specimens, that is, tissue slices > 50 mm 2 .

For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cryotechniques have the following advantages. 1. Cryofixation (rapid freezing) is the fastest way to immobilize a biological sample at a defined physiologic state. Thereby, all processes in a cell are arrested within milliseconds. Chemical fixation, in contrast, takes seconds or minutes to act, leading to unpredictable osmotic effects and redistribution of cellular compounds. 2. A frozen biological sample behaves like any other bulk specimen, and redistribution of substances is almost excluded. Inner structures can be made amenable to the electron beam by cryofracturing or cryosectioning. 3. The conductive metal layers have a finer grain size when applied to cold samples, because diffusion of the metal atoms on the surface is reduced. 4. The frozen sample is analyzed in the SEM by use of a cold stage. This prevents volume changes due to drying artifacts. In addition, hydrocarbon contamination due to irradiation by the electron beam is greatly reduced at cold temperatures.",

The high surface-to-volume ratio inherent in particulate samples, and the fact that we already live in a sea of possibly contaminating particles, necessitates special care and understanding in particle preparation. Selection of reagents and handling practices can be critical. For instance, in a hypothetical case, a particle analyst reports that his sample consists of approximately five major inorganic phases. The first has a rounded morphology with crystalline overgrowths, the light element content of the second is depleted, the crystalline structure of the next is damaged, the fourth occurs at a 5% volume level, and the fifth consists of glass shards. In this example, these results are essentially worthless. Phase one was soluble in a liquid used in the preparation process and then reprecipitated upon evaporation. The light elements of the second were leached because of the use of the same solvent. The third was attacked by HF formation during ultrasonification in a fluorinated solvent. The fourth was originally present at a 10% volume level, but was preferentially attracted to the sides of the storage container prior to sample preparation, biasing the sampling; and the fifth is not part of the original sample, but comes from the ground glass neck of one of the reagent bottles.",

The important drawbacks are that the replicas have to be cleaned (subsequent changing of several cleaning solutions over hours or days), picked up (disintegration of highly structured replicas happens frequently), and can be viewed only as a result of one single fracturing event. Specimens providing IV-18 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) FIG highly redundant structures and relatively smooth fractures, such as cell suspensions or o/w emulsions, were investigated using freeze fracture/replication and ambient temperature transmission electron microscopy (AT-TEM). 2 Freeze-drying is comparable to freeze-etching ( Fig. 1) , but with the important difference that all the water is removed from the specimen by sublimation. In TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), or scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), small cell components or particles, such as viruses, can be imaged together with the replication layer on top. 3 In freeze-fracturing for low-temperature SEM (LT-SEM), most advantages of TEM cryopreparation are kept. The preparation includes: (a) quick freezing; (b) fracturing under high vacuum conditions (c) coating with a planar magnetron sputter source (PMS, Ar as working gas); (d) 3-D imaging and observation of changed conditions (in situ etching); (e) high signal/noise ratio of Pt or W coatings for secondary electron imaging and low yield from Cr for backscattered electron detection of immuno-gold labelled specimens. The specimens can be imaged directly eventually after multiple fracturing (i.e., searching of distinct structures) in a different situation (i.e., fully hydrated or partly freeze-dried, coated or uncoated), in a \"close to nature state.\" 4 However, new problems have to be solved in order to get thin reproducible, conductive coatings, without superimposition of specimen and coating film structures and direct imaging, reducing contamination and beam damage, 5 or long-term low temperature storage. Moreover, the coating film thickness, the ice in the frozen bulk specimen, and, most important of all, the type of SEM are now limiting the structural resolution. The biological relevant details of results obtained with low-temperature SEM in a conventional fieldemission SEM can be compared with those achieved with routine freeze fracture/replication and TEM. 6 According to Honig and Hook, 7 the physics of water in high vacuum play an ultimate role in the application of these techniques (Fig. 2) ; therefore, only this knowledge in combination with cold stages and high vacuum technology enable the application of state of the art preparations of biological material for electron microscopy.",

Using the technique, the effects of trauma, in particular the intracellular shifts of calcium and other diffusible ions, can be analyzed and recorded by qualitative and quantitative electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Chemical fixation must be avoided if one intends to attempt the EPMA localization of diffusible substances in cells and tissues. The goal of the cryo-jet method is to confine axonal components and chemical elements to a biologically natural position. Trau- matized mouse embryo cord explants were compared with the intact rat spinal cord trauma model, 2 using EPMA studies of perturbations of calcium and other ions that are reported to be located in the axonal cytoskeleton. 3 ICR mouse embryo spinal cord explants were grown to 14-21-day maturation in Maximow chambers. Cords that survived stringent elimination examination criteria and exhibited minimal degeneration or spontaneous necrosis were randomly divided into four groups. Group I served as experimental controls; Group II was traumatized by dropping a 25 mg weight through a 4.5 cm glass pipette positioned directly over the culture and cryojetted 1 h after trauma. Representative explants from I and II were freeze-substituted and embedded in epoxy for comparison. By light microscopic examination of the whole mount, living culture, the site of impact could be determined within 10-30 min. The impact zone became markedly dense when compared with the surrounding, uninjured tissue. Toluidine blue of the freeze-substituted sections revealed the site of impact on the surface and path of the trauma damage through the explant. Control cultures with spontaneous necrosis could be distinguished from the experimental group, because the traumatic necrosis was confluent and often even wedge-shaped. Within the traumatized zone, nerve fiber alterations similar to those observed in in vivo spinal cord trauma and calcium toxicity could be found, that is, granular degeneration of axoplasm, pleomorphic spheroids, tubulovesicular profiles, and myelin showing adaxonal, periaxonal, and intramyelinic vacuolization. Light microscopy sections from the freeze-substituted explants were noted to be well preserved at the surface and into the culture for 100-200 \u00b5m (Fig. 1) ; however, some ice crystal damage was noted deep within the body of the culture. Previous studies that compared metal mirror and plunge freezing results with the propane jet methodology reported here confirmed that propane jetting is the method of choice for preserving organotypic spinal cord tissue cultures.",

One group was similar in elemental composition to controls, although the morphology was dissimilar, while a second group had 80-90% lower K and 5-10-fold elevated Ca (Fig. 2) . The response of axons and the associated myelin was paired, that is, loss of K and gain of Na within the axon was always accompanied by comparable changes in the myelin and vice versa. The morphologic appearance of axons was not a predictor of the elemental composition. The cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster manifests cardiac dysfunction from an early age, with the disease ultimately progressing to congestive heart failure. On the basis of significant elevation in the Ca 2+ content of the CM hearts, as well as significantly increased Ca 2+ in the mitochondrial (MT) fractions and an increased density of voltage-sensitive Ca 2+ channels, previous studies suggested a Ca 2+ overload in the CM hearts (Sen et al. 1990 ). Evidence has also been presented for an increased sensitivity of cardiac muscle cells of CM hamster hearts to an external Ca 2+ \"stress,\" that is, any manipulation which increases Ca 2+ influx into the cells (Hano and Lakatta 1991, Sen et al. 1990 ). On the other hand, ultrastructural studies have shown localized focal lesions from an early age, believed to be due to local cell injury. The cardiac myocytes within these areas suffer irreversible damage, becoming Ca 2+ overloaded as demonstrated by measurements of MT and A-band (AB) Ca 2+ content by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) in a previous study from our laboratory (Bond et al. 1989 ). This study also demonstrated that the vast majority of cardiac myocytes throughout the CM hearts not only had a normal ultrastructural appearance, but also showed no elevation of subcellular Ca 2+ content.",

The application of automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to the analysis of particulate populations is in many ways a unique application of microanalytical instrumentation. When applied to the analysis of large numbers of particles, the SEM is used as both a microanalytical and a macroanalytical instrument. As a microanalytical instrument, the SEM provides single-particle compositional and morphologic information that is not available from the conventional macroanalytical techniques used in particle analysis such as atomic absorption and instrumental neutron activation analysis. As a macroanalytical instrument, the SEM, when used for automated particle analysis, provides information from which population characteristics can be inferred. For example, automated SEM information often is used to determine the percent of an aerosol that originates from a given source by extrapolating the single-particle results (e.g., the number of particles containing major Fe) to the entire particle population, that is, the air filter. This value is then extrapolated to the sampled air volume.",

Samples of the different glasses were prepared as bulk-polished specimens and as particles. The results from the analyses of the bulk samples represented the \"best case\" that could be expected under a given set of analytical conditions since there were no particle effects involved. All analyses were done on an electron probe and a SEM at 15 keV and 1 nA beam current. Dead times for the bulk and particle analyses were between 15 and 20%. Two separate counting times were selected for the experiment , 200 s and 15 s. These times resulted in the x-ray peak intensities for Pb and U M xrays that are shown in Table II .

Although different aspects of zoosporogenesis have been studied in a number of zoosporic fungi, little is known about the events of zoospore formation in the sporangium of the Monoblepharidales, or the Chytridiomycetes in general. Earlier studies of other zoosporic fungi proposed various spore formation events that have been challenged recently (Hyde et al. 1991) , especially with respect to the relationship of vesicles, golgi, and cleavage furrows. Hyde et al. (1991) concluded that all eukaryotic cleavage events may need reinvestigation.",

The disease, termed white spot disease, can cause extreme fish loss in marine aquaria and mariculture environments. Cryptocaryon irritans attaches to the epidermis of the fish and feeds on epidermal cells. This form of the ciliate termed the \"trophont\" appears as large white spots on the fish. The trophonts grow in size and eventually leave the host. The free-living trophont settles down to the substrate and secretes a cyst wall. While in this resting stage known as the \"tomont,\" the cell undergoes a series of unequal palintomic divisions to form daughter cells called \"tomites.\" The cyst wall ruptures and free swimming ciliates known as \"theronts\" are released. The theronts represent the infective stage as they search for new hosts.",

The secretion of mucocysts might contain enzymes that help the theront to penetrate into fish epidermis. They also might aid trophonts in feeding on fish tissue and have a function in cyst wall formation at the later stage. Penetration into the fish tissue probably is started by mucocyst secretion that either enables the parasite to stick to the tissues or to help it enter the tissue by enzymatic reaction over the irritated areas. The theront may then utilize its relatively stiff oral cilia for burrowing into the these irritated areas. After burrowing into the epidermis of fish, the theront develops its oral apparatus and increases its size. Trophonts eventually leave the host when they reach a certain size (350-450 \u00b5m).",

            "text": "Most of the advances in probe manufacturing (on a wafer level) have come about by utilizing silicon as the probe material. Several silicon probe types are now available, which provide significantly sharper tips with aspect ratios on the order of 5 to 1. 5 For imaging structures of higher aspect ratios, such as vias or deep trenches, longer and thinner probes are needed. These are made possible by using a combination of FIB and electron beam techniques to \"grow\" a thin probe using an existing Si 3 N 4 pyramidal probe as the base (Fig. 2 ). 6 These probes are available in lengths up to 2 \u00b5m with aspect ratios of \u2265 10 to 1. Utilizing a combination of FIB milling of existing structures and electron beam growth, probes with lengths of 8-10 \u00b5m are feasible. An obvious problem with probes of this type (and with any long, thin structure) is \"flexing\" during imaging. Analysis of one such probes' physical characteristics has shown that the elastic modulus is relatively low (E~1.5GPa), while the coefficient of friction on most surfaces is extremely low (\u00b5<0.05). Thus, probes of this type should be kept as short as possible while exceeding the maximum peak-to-valley distance to be imaged. 7 Other scanned probe techniques now in the prototype phase include thermal, magnetic force, near field optical, and probes capable of imaging undercut sidewalls. Probes for all of these methods have been shown to be feasible, although manufacturing techniques to provide large quantities, reliably and repeatably, have yet to be developed. When imaging with an atomic force microscope (AFM), the image resolution is a complex function of the relative tip and sample geometries. When imaging or measuring high-aspect ratio features, sharp and slender tips offer the possibility of probing down into extremely small topographical features. The most commonly used contact mode AFM tips are batchfabricated Si 3 N 4 thin-film cantilevers with an integrated pyramidal structure used as the tip. 1 It has been shown that microtips, which are fabricated by electron beam-induced growth of carbonaceous material on the apex of the pyramid, can reduce the artifacts associated with integrated pyramidal AFM tips. 2 graph of a whisker of electron beam-grown contamination, or microtip, grown on the apex of an integrated pyramid, is shown in Figure 1 . An obvious problem with the use of a long slender microtip is the lateral deflection of the microtip as it is scanned across the sample surface. The proper use and interpretation of artifacts associated with electron beam-grown microtips demands an understanding of the mechanics of microtip deflection. It has been observed that long, slender microtips scanned over flat surfaces (rms roughness of < 1 nm) produce hysteresis in the fast-scan direction. A model has been developed to explain the observed hysteresis loop in terms of a mechanical cantilever beam deflecting because of lateral frictional forces induced by repulsive imaging forces. This model is shown schematically in Figure 2 . By applying cantilever beam mechanics to the model of microtip deflection, a method of calculating the elastic modulus of microtip material has been developed. To find the elastic modulus of microtip material, a series of experimentally determined microtip deflection distances and the respective microtip lengths are required. Microtip deflection distances have been experimentally determined for 18 different microtip lengths on two different flat surfaces; fusion deposited boro-silicate glass and polished silicon. The elastic modulus of the microtip material has been determined from the deflection data to be approximately 1.4 GPa. Once the elastic modulus has been determined, the coefficient of friction between microtip material and a sample sur-face can be calculated. The coefficient of friction between a microtip and the sample surface will indicate if the sample material is suitable for AFM imaging with electron beam-grown microtips.",

            "text": "The elastic modulus of microtip material and the coefficient of friction data lead to a better understanding not only of microtips but of electron beam-induced contamination in general. The low elastic modulus rules out the possibility of the material being diamond-like and suggests a polymeric material. The use of microtips can greatly improve image resolution; however, it is important to note that since microtip deflection increases with increasing microtip length, the microtip used to image a sample surface should be as short as possible while remaining long enough to image the largest peak-valley structure on the sample surface. The magnitude of observed microtip deflection should be reduced substantially by the use of AC mode microscopes where surface friction is less of a concern. Because of their ability to achieve high resolution simultaneously in all three dimensions in a wide range of ambient conditions, scanning probe microscopes are promising candidates for performing measurements of surface topography. Crosssectional and perspective views can be generated, nondestructively, at any location once an image has been acquired. Surface topography measurements fall into two basic classes: position (or pitch) measurement and size (or critical dimension) measurement. The ability of a microscope to perform position measurement depends more on the quality of its design and construction than on the fundamental interaction of probing beam or stylus with the sample. Size measurement, on the other hand, depends strongly on the probe-sample interaction. Modern manufacturing, especially semiconductor lithography, often produces high-aspect ratio, submicron structures whose size and shape must be known with tiny uncertainties. Surprisingly, stylus profilometers in the guise of scanning probe microscopes can perform some of these measurements at a level unmatched by any other type of microscope. To obtain size and shape measurements in semiconductor manufacture, we have developed a scanning probe microscope with several refinements, depicted in the Figure. 1 We use capacitance-based sensors for probe force sensing IV-30 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) Cantilever and microtip at rest and for probe position measurement. 2, 3 Many of the samples that we scan are at least partially electrically insulating. For this reason, our microscope is used primarily as a scanning force microscope, although it is capable of operating as a tunneling microscope also. Our force sensor employs a small silicon beam that pivots in one dimension about a pair of magnetically constrained ball bearings. The beam forms a pair of capacitors that both sense the position of the beam and maintain its balance with a suitable servo loop. This force-balance technique allows high-force sensitivity without sacrificing the stiffness required to resist surface forces. Capacitors are also used to measure the position of the probe tip. The piezoceramic tube used as a scan actuator exhibits strong hysteresis and creep, so the drive voltage is an unreliable measure of probe position. The capacitors monitor the probe position in all three dimensions during the scan, and these data are collected along with the topograph.",

In surface roughness measurements, a blunt probe can severely limit the range of spatial frequencies that can be detected. In scans of high-aspect ratio features, the probe shape determines what parts of the features can be measured. When scanning deep trenches and holes on a patterned surface, we use either a conical probe or a cylindrical probe, depending of what part of the feature is most important. The conical probes are made using focused ion beam sputtering of iridium. 4 A chemical etch is used to form the cylindrical probes. If the probe shape is well known, then it is possible to determine what parts of a scan were distorted by the probe tip and, in some cases, this distortion can be removed. 5, 6 The probe microscope itself can be used to determine the probe tip shape if a suitable structure is available for probe characterization. 7 Since the pioneering work of Binnig and Rohrer in the early 1980s on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the STM has evolved into a powerful tool for spectroscopy, metrology, electrochemistry, and nanolithography.

Typical resolutions of 40-100 nm are obtainable in the MFM mode, although resolutions of 10-25nm have also been achieved with considerable effort. In our work, topographical imaging was performed in the contact mode using a V-shape silicon nitride cantilever of length l = 200 \u00b5m, width w = 18 \u00b5m, thickness t = 1 \u00b5m and force constant k = 0.64 N/m. The sensing tip at the end of the cantilever is pyramidal in shape, with a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00b5m square base and 1:1 aspect ratio. The tip radius is typically smaller than 500 \u00c5. For magnetic force imaging, the instrument was operated in the noncontact amplitude resonance mode by oscillating the cantilever and measuring changes in its resonant frequency using either phase or amplitude detection. This method of detection is responsive to the force gradient. For each point of the recorded image, the cantilever was first brought to a large tipto-sample distance of 100 nm or greater to acquire the magnetic force image and subsequently moved close to the sample surface to acquire the topography image. This allows the simultaneous acquisition of topography and magnetic force images. A -10 V specimen bias was also applied to provide a linearizing and stabilizing force to the servo feedback loop. The cantilever used for the MFM imaging is a diving boardshape probe made of (100) silicon. The geometry of the cantilever are l = 450 \u00b5m, w = 35 \u00b5m, t = 6 \u00b5m and k = 1 N/m. The sensing tip is conical in shape with a height of about 15 \u00b5m, an aspect ratio of 3:1, and a tip radius of < 200 \u00c5. The cantilever, which was sputter-coated with a 600 \u00c5 thin-film cobalt material and magnetized inside a 200-400 Gauss solenoid field, has a typical resonant frequency of 72 kHz. Figure 1 shows a three-dimensional topographic profile of a defective thin-film recording head, in which the pole tips protrude slightly from the surface, using the contact AFM mode. The dimensions of the two rectangular pole tips are about 8 \u00b5m \u00d7 4 \u00b5m and 11 \u00b5m \u00d7 4 \u00b5m. The gap width was measured to be about 0.35 \u00b5m. Dirt particles can also be seen and these are due to the cleaning process during sample preparation whereby the head was lightly swabbed with a cotton tip soaked in methanol. Figure 2 shows the magnetic force image of the surface of a recorded computer hard disk. The bright and dark lines represent regions of different magnetization or bits on the hard disk surface. The separation between each pair of bright-dark lines was measured to be about 2.3 \u00b5m and the track width is about 20 \u00b5m. The striations in the topographic image (not shown), representing the texture lines, are approximately perpendicular to the recorded bit patterns. The line profile of the bit patterns in Figure 2 (not shown) is very similar to the calculated force gradient contours by Mamin et al. (1988) in which both the horizontal and vertical magnetization components of the tip are are being sensed. IV-32 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) FIG. 1 Three-dimensional topographic profile of a defective thin-film recording head using contact AFM, in which the pole tips protrude slightly from the surface. In a good recording head, the pole-tips are supposed to be slightly recessed from the surrounding region. Image resolution in traditional far-field microscopy is limited by diffraction caused by the primary aperture in the optical system of the microscope being used. In practice, diffraction limits lateral resolution to approximately \u03bb/2, or about 0.5 micron for optical microscopes.",

New aluminum crimp needles were sealed in diet cola and removed at 24-h intervals. Stereoscopic light microscopy was initially used to examine each needle crimp. It was discovered that the submersion produced a brown to black \"corrosion flower\" in less than 24 h of soaking. Of specific interest, the submersion repeatedly produced a single point of corrosion on the crimp. The single point of corrosion suggested possible electrolysis of the aluminum crimp in the soft drink. This corrosion point continued to enlarge and penetrate more deeply into the aluminum crimp over time. Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and x-ray mapping were used to highlight the region of corrosion in the SEM. Figure 1 shows the secondary and backscattered electron image (SEI and BEI) of an aluminum crimp on a syringe needle after 24 h submersion in diet cola.

Two systems were examined: one system characterized the kinetics of hybrid dissociation of two synthetic ODNs while a second system examined the distribution of hybrid complexes formed by hybridization of injected ODNs with endogenous mRNA. In the first system, a 28-mer phosphodiester ODN (+PD) was synthesized and labeled with a 3\u2032 rhodamine (+PD-R). The complementary, antisense 5\u2032-fluorescein labeled phosphorothioate ODN (-PT-F) was specifically quenched by addition of the +PD-R, as detected by both absorbance and FRET in solution. Rapid and specific hybridization between the ODNs occurred at 17 \u00b5M within 1 min and the preformed hybrid slowly dissociated (T1/2 \u2248 3 h) in the presence of a 300-fold excess of the unlabeled ODN. Upon microinjection into the cytoplasm of cells, preformed fluorescent hybrids dissociated with a halftime of 15 min, which is attributed to the degradation of the phosphodiester. Formation of the hybrid from sequentially injected ODNs was detected by FRET transiently in the cytoplasm and later in the cell nucleus, where nearly all injected ODNs accumulate. Diffuse, specific nucleoplasmic FRET could be distinguished from nonspecific FRET in punctate nuclear structures which may result from concentration effects similar to FRET seen in late endosomes or lysosomes between endocytosed, inert FITC-dextran and +PT-R ODN.",

The upstream ODN was 5\u2032 labeled with FITC and the downstream ODN was 3\u2032 labeled with rhodamine. When hybridized to synthetic actin mRNA or a complementary 40-mer PD ODN, quenching of FITC and FRET was observed in solution. Injection studies in 3T3 cells showed transient ODN accumulation and FRET in filopodia and extended processes. In N18 neuroblastomas, FITC quenching was dependent upon cytoplasmic compartmentalization. After 30 min, both ODNs accumulated into the nucleus. In summary, these experiments suggest that antisense ODNs can hybridize to intracellular targets in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The goal of this work was to increase the sensitivity of the electron backscattering pattern (EBSP) technique by introducing an electron energy filter to increase contrast and improve pattern visibility. Energy filtering previously has been shown to increase contrast in selected area channelling patterns (Joy 1986) . Energy filtering differs from arithmetic background subtraction in signal processing, because filtering before detection has a physical basis and eliminates the unwanted background without increasing the noise component in the signal.",

Provided a constant speed of the beam is maintained, the thickness of the produced rods was found to be inversely proportional to the beam speed but decreasing towards the rod's end. This result is similar to that obtained by electron-beam-induced fabrication of self-supporting carbon-containing rods 3 Electron microscopic observation of the inner structure of these self-supporting metal-containing rods revealed many individual fibers mutually aligned in parallel. Thus, the mor- IV-38 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) FIG. 1 TEM image (a) and SAD pattern (b) from a self-supporting tungsten containing rod section after annealing in vacuum at 400\u02daC for 15 min. The accelerating voltage is 200 kV, the diffraction length on the (b) is 130 cm. phology of these rods is similar to that of the well-known carbon rods 4 . This observation suggests similar formation mechanisms independent from the rod material. Selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns show the prepared rods as being amorphous. In situ annealing of the tungsten-containing rods at 400\u02daC for 15 min in the heating holder inside the microscope column transforms the amorphous structure into a nanocrystalline one (Fig. 1) . SAD patterns reveal the presence of a set of different phases: in addition to pure crystalline tungsten there are various tungsten-containing compounds. Among them, in particular, two new cubic phases with lattice constants 696 \u00b1 3 pm and 587 \u00b1 3 pm could be identified. After annealing chemical and phase compositions of the rods grown from W(CO) 6 and Rez(CO) 10 were found to differ depending on the conditions of their formation (reagent vapor pressure, electron current, beam speed). The rods of nano-sized width, grown from Rez(CO) 10 are considered to be promising as tips for scanning tunneling microscopes because of their chemical stability. An important requirement for developing high-speed highpower devices is fabrication of thermally stable ohmic contacts with low resistance and smooth interfaces. Metal semiconductor interface inhomogeneities, such as lateral interface phases and spiking protrusions, lead to nonuniform current flow and consumption of the GaAs substrate. This type of interface morphology is not acceptable for device applications where a large electric field or shallow contact is required. In particular, devices such as a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) cannot tolerate contacts with lateral and vertical interface inhomogeneities. Recently, we have introduced a novel metallization scheme, Pt/Ti/Ge/Pd, which yields thermally stable and low resistance ohmic contacts to both n and p + -GaAs (Han et. al. 1993) .To insure processing reproducibility and contact reliability, one must identify and understand the mechanisms responsible for this contact's electrical per-formance. This study employed cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and electrical measurements (transmission line mode) to investigate the structural, chemical, and electrical properties of this contact. The interface morphology, phase composition, and elemental diffusion were examined and correlated with the measured contact resistances at annealing temperatures which yielded the best slight degradation and the worst electrical performance.",

The Pd and Ge reacted to form a PdGe phase. Directly beneath the PdGe was a thin, discontinuous, Ga-rich Pd-Ga-As ternary phase. The presence of this Ga-rich ternary compound has important implications for contact formation on the n-GaAs substrate. Formation of this interface phase creates excess Ga vacancies in the GaAs substrate. Upon heating, Ge diffuses into the GaAs, occupying Ga vacancies at dopant levels, to form an n + surface layer, thus allowing considerable tunneling at the metal-semiconductor interface. The existence of the Ga vacancies is crucial, because otherwise Ge would not readily diffuse into the n-GaAs to form this n + -GaAs layer. For the p + -GaAs, this Ge indiffusion occurs also, but the Ge concentration level is not such that it has a detrimental effect, that is, it does not approach that of carbon (the p-type dopant) ~5 \u00d7 10 19 cm -3 .

The interface exhibited a roughness on the order of 10 nm and possessed large areas where spiking single-phased PdGeGa protrusions spatially dominated the metal-semiconductor interface region. The nonplanar nature of the interface lends itself to several explanations: (1) nonuniformity in the heating associated with the annealing process, (2) material defects or pitting in the GaAs substrate such that the contact metallization covered and filled the pitted area as it would a flat GaAs surface, and/or (3) new phases being formed as a result of the Ti layer beginning to break down as a diffusion barrier. Apparently, this interface nonuniformity (spiking) does not cause significant deterioration in the specific contact resistance, since the contact resistance maintains reasonable electrical integrity.

Scanning 10, 87-106 The examination of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond films by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) (secondary electron mode with spatial resolution 5-10 nm) shows that the morphologies of films are strongly affected by the synthesis conditions, especially the substrate temperature, the methane concentration, total pressure in the deposition chamber, etc. Studies demonstrate that the changes of CH4 for concentrations in the range of 0.2-10% vol. create the shape variation of crystals determined by the ratio of the apparent growth rates of the (111) and (100) faces R(111)/R(100) in cubo-octaedrons interval from 0.577-1.732. The exact cubooctahedral shape observed very frequently is determined by the value of ratio 1.1547 and preferable orientation of the (111)-or (100) faces. Thus, the secondary electron mode of the SEM is a very useful diagnostic technique for diamond films. Less frequently researchers use the second diagnostic availability of the SEM (Saparin and Obyden 1994) : Cathodoluminescence (CL) mode (spatial resolution 0.2-0.5 mkm) with monochromatic and panchromatic (real color) images and local CL spectra. Diagnostic possibilities of this mode identify the quality of diamond films in comparison with natural diamond. The CL spectra of undoped epitaxial films show the dependence on the face upon which the epitaxy was done. CL discriminates between different types of diamond. There are distinct spectral differences between natural, synthetic diamonds and CVD films. The CL emission of the A-band was associated with donor-acceptor pair recombination (blue and green regions); vacancy-rich material emits in the red spectral region (575-633 nm). We would like to note that the CL spectra of natural diamonds (types Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb) lie in the range of 420-460 nm. Variations in these CL spectra were attributed to differences in the defect structures formed during the growth of material. CL images and local spectra allow one to recognize, for doped and undoped films, the small amounts of impurities, such as Al(30ppm) and B(0.3ppm) and nitrogen remaining in the gas, which could be a possible source of donors. Thus, the SEM investigations of morphology, crystallinity, and CL emission of films led to the correlative estima-tion of diamond film quality in comparison with the natural diamond as standard. The etching process of a crystal surface during its dissolution is well-known. The process of etch pits formation, as a result of crystals dissolution, usually is explained by scientists by the presence of dislocations inside the crystal structure. However, the same process occurring near the crystal edges is studied less, although such investigations can give additional scientific knowledge for a better understanding of the dissolution mechanisms of solids. This brief communication continues the series of investigations (Dorozhkin 1993 , Dorozhkin et al. 1992 The results show that here can be various surface structures taking place under geometric interaction among the growing etch pits and dissolving FAP crystal surfaces. As the FAP has a hexagonal crystal structure, the growing etch pits mainly have a hexagonal shape also (Dorozhkin 1993 , Dorozhkin et al. 1992 ). On the other hand, the investigated FAP crystals were obtained from natural FAP-containing rock after its disintegration and concentration stages. Therefore, the crystals had a very irregular shape and a lot of dislocations inside. Figure 1 shows an example of a typical hexagonal etch pit having only three faces instead of the necessary six; three lacking faces (left side) have already been dissolved by the acid. A very similar situation is presented in Figure 2 . This is another example of a former hexagonal etch pit having only three faces (center).",

            "text": "It is easy to restore events which occurred with the pits some minutes before. The pits began to form and grow from the moment when the outputs of dislocations on the FAP crystal surface began to interact with the acid solution. As the pits are always faced only by fast dissolving faces, their dissolution rate is greater than the one for the crystal surface in common. On the other hand, the growing of etch pits and the FAP crystal surface dissolution are always occurring simultaneously. As a result, a layer of FAP substance between the growing pit, which is situated close to any vicinal dissolving crystal face, and the vicinal crystal face itself were getting increasingly thinner. Finally, this layer disappeared completely, resulting in the pits' formation having only three faces (Figs. 1, 2) . If one had dissolved the FAP crystal for a few more seconds, its surface would have reached the bottom of the pits and they would have disappeared entirely. Figure 3 shows an example of interaction between etch pits with an irregular shape and a surface of the FAP crystal. For this purpose a very thin and sharp spallation fragment of the FAP crystal was chosen which was then etched by phosphoric acid solution. Inasmuch as the spallation fragment was equal to a random and unknown crystallographic face, the irregular etch pits were obtained. It is easy to see four different states of such pits (Fig. 3) : they point to a pit which (1) (4) is only running through the FAP crystal but is situated relatively far from the dissolving crystal face. Finally it should be noted that all the above-mentioned cases of interaction among pits and crystal surface may only take place when directions of dislocations inside the dissolving crystals are close to lines parallel to any nearest vicinal crystal face.",

On the other hand, Figures 1b and 2b show the corresponding x-ray diffraction patterns of the amorphous (Fig. 1a) and the annealed structures (Fig. 2a) , respectively. Figures 1a and 2a are basically three dimensional line plots of the surface profile. It is clear that the amorphous structure (Fig. 1a) represents a complete rough surface along 200 nm \u00d7 200 nm scanning area. In contrary, the annealed structure (Fig. 2a) exhibits a surface profile with less surface roughness than the annealed structure. This observation is in agreement with work done by the author on other metallic glasses cited elsewhere (Habib et al. 1992 ). The current status of external funding for most academic and research facilities throughout this country is meager at best. Many institutions are being forced to seek financial support from sources other than the conventional governmental agencies, private funding, or contractual agreements. This facility has, for the past 15 years, derived the bulk of its operational budget through third-party payments for services rendered as hospital charges for diagnostic pathology services. While we have been fairly successful in maintaining a relatively consistent level of service, the overall cost of this operation continues to rise. As cost containment became the buzz word and hospital admissions declined, the number of requests for diagnostic procedures also began to decline. This pattern was observed not only in the electron microscopy (EM) lab but in many other specialized laboratories throughout the hospital and our affiliated clinics. As the health care debate accelerated and new concepts such as HMOs, emergency care clinics, managed competition, and regional alliances all geared to assure \"more health care for the dollar came into being,\" it became apparent that an entire new concept was needed to provide high-quality diagnostic services for these newer group practices and smaller clinics that were being created to meet these new demands.",

Not only does traditional chemical fixation remove electrolytes from the tissue, it is common in electron microscopy laboratories to add heavy metals such as osmium, uranium, and lead. These elements may produce peaks in the final spectrum that can obscure important elements of physiologic significance. For example, the M-alpha line for lead obscures the K-alpha line for sulfur. In conducting an EPMA study, it is important to identify all peaks obtained so that the investigator is not mislead by a contaminant. In addition, it is important to utilize several controls. The investigator should not only probe the feature of interest, but also the cytoplasm adjacent to that feature and the blank stub. Only in this manner can artifacts contributed by, for example, metal in the microscope column be understood and eliminated from consideration. All living things are infected/affected by viruses. Whether the subject is a tissue culture, an animal being used in research, or a human, it behaves differently when infected with a virus. In research subjects virus identification is important to prevent erroneous data due to the presence of a foreign organism. In the case of human viral illness, it is increasingly important to identify pathogens so that appropriate viral therapy can be initiated. Several antiviral agents are already on the market, and many more are presently in clinical trials.",

Virus particles were seen by thin section EM as shells coated with barely distinct surface projections and enclosing hair-like strands of nucleocapsid material (Fig. 2) . Particle size (80-120 nm) was smaller than that seen by negative stain EM. Spherical particles with elongated tubules (Fig. 2) were often observed by both negative stain and thin-section EM.

The angioarchitecture of the tibia was studied with use of the scanning electron microscope. At low magnification the pattern of vascularisation to the tibia could be established. They are richly supplied with arteries which pass into the bone substance proper from the periosteum. The main supply is from the nutrient arteries, which divide longitudinally in a dichotomous manner after passing through a foramina in the compact bone, major branches running both proximally and distally. This is the general case in all long bones. These branches reach the epiphysis and diaphysis of the tibia. In addition, separate arterial entities supply specific regions of the tibia: I. periostal vessels, II. epiphyseal vessels, and III. diaphyseal vessels.",

Arterial nuclear impressions are oriented longitudinally to the long axis of the vessel, whereas in veins they are situated circumferentially (Miodonski et al. 1981) . For further details about methods, see Syed Ali et al. 1991. At higher magnification it was possible to demonstrate the microangioarchitecture of the epiphyseal region, which consisted of a very fine meshwork of capillaries arising from a main epiphyseal artery. A connection between arteries of the epiphysis was observed and consisted of medium-sized arteries. The capillaries of the epiphyseal meshwork show a rich anastomosing network building open, sinus-like dilatations. Capillaries are also richly present in the areas of the growth plate and stressed areas of the epiphysis of the tibia. The so-called sinuses are situated under the cartilaginous plate. The venous drainage takes place through the vessels running parallel to the corresponding arteries. The animals were premedicated with chloroform and were then anesthetized with Ketanest (0.3 ml/kg body weight) via intraperitoneal injection. After examining the abdominal reflex the rabbits were fixed on an operating table. All preparations were carried out at room temperature. The abdomen was shaved and opened cranially at the xyphoid process down to the pubic symphysis. After gently displacing the intestines and mesenterial convolutes, the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava were exposed very carefully caudal to the kidney vessels. A knob cannula was inserted through a small incision in the abdominal aorta and held in place by a ligation around the cannula distal to the point of incision. These procedures should be performed very quickly, otherwise the blood pressure will fall. The hindlimb vessels were washed through the cannula with an isotonic NaCl solution containing heparin (15000 I.E.) and sodium nitroprusside (280 mg/l) in 1000 ml. The inferior vena cava was opened with an incision as exit for fixing fluid and clamped when required. Soon thereafter, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.135 m, Ph 7.2) was passed through the same cannula. After completing the perfusion, about 60 ml Mercox (methacrylate) was applied through the cannula and observed until the Mercox came out of the inferior vena cava. It was then clamped to avoid unnecessary backflow.",

We conclude that interference reflection mode, video-rate, laser scanning confocal microscopy is a useful tool for intravital analysis of the intracellular structural dynamics in relationship to cell type, function and pathophysiological state.",

            "text": "Department of Plant Pathology and Department of Botany, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA Powdery mildew diseases of plants are caused by a group of obligately parasitic fungi belonging to the order Erysiphales, class Ascomycetes. The somatic hyphae of most of these fungi grow exclusively on the surfaces of infected plant organs, most typically leaves. These hyphae form specialized structures known as appressoria that attach to the host surface. Each appressorium gives rise to a tiny penetration peg that penetrates the wall of the underlying epidermal cell and invaginates the host cell plasma membrane. The penetration peg then develops into a specialized structure known as a haustorium that absorbs nutrients from the host cell. In this study transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the haustoria of the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe lagerstromemiae and the relationship of these structures to epidermal cells of infected leaves of crape-myrtle (Lagerstromemia indica).",

Much of the neck is surrounded by a collar of host cell wall material. A single septum with a tiny central pore with which Woronin bodies are associated is present in the distal portion of the neck near the haustorial body. The haustorial body is divided into numerous small, coiled branches. The entire haustorial apparatus is separated from the host cell cytoplasm by an extrahaustorial membrane (Figs. 1, 2) . Though continuous with the host cell plasma membrane, the extrahaustorial membrane is much thicker than the plasma membrane and is highly convoluted in certain regions. The haustorial branches are separated from the extrahaustorial membrane by a region known as the extrahaustorial matrix. At this point it is unclear whether the finely fibrillar material comprising this matrix originates from the fungus, the host cell or both.",

This result was in agreement with the finding of Marmo (1965) . There were no differences in the distribution pattern of AP activity of the hair cells from the distal to the proximal region in the basilar papilla. In particular, hair cells of lagenar macula were most often characterized by intense AP activity in the subcuticular area (Fig. 2) . The functional significance of high levels of AP in the hair cell is still a matter of conjecture. For example, Ishii and Balogh (1966) demonstrated no morphologic evidence for phagocytic or secretory activities in hair cells, although their electron micrographs of hair cells reveal lipofuscin-like substances within lysosomes. It has long been contended that nonsensory hair cells such as stria vascularis, external spiral sulcus cells, and those around the macula and cristae ampullares help to regulate the ionic composition of endolymph (Kimura et al. 1964, Kikuchi and Hilding 1966) . In the present study, the columnar cells and the cells of the tegmentum vasculosum showed moderate to strong AP activity, and the transitional epithelia of the cristae ampullares also showed strong AP activity . The dark cells help to regulate the ionic composition of endolymph and perilymph (Kimura 1969 ). In the present study, intense AP activity of dark cells was concentrated in the supranuclear area or diffusely in the cytoplasm. These results show that AP activity is highest in cells with highest levels of transport activities on the production of endolymph (Marmo 1965) , although the metabolic linkage between AP and the transport enzymes is uncertain. The wall cells and supporting cells of the vestibular labyrinth showed no enzyme reaction. The statoacoustic and vestibular ganglion cells showed various degrees of AP activity. The sections of statoacoustic and vestibular ganglion cells of specimens that had been embedded in LR White displayed more intense AP activity than those sections from specimens embedded in JB-4. AP activity was also stronger in specimens fixed in 2.5% PFA than in 2.5% GA.",

Some villi shoots were thinned gradually from base to its apex, and at the top these developing villi showed very interesting properties; they were curved, thinned, and crossed each other (Fig. 1) . The predominant villi types were immature, intermediate, and mesenchymal villi. [7] [8] [9] The surface of these villi trees was completely covered by small and deformative curved microvilli and by fibrinoid particles compared with the normal uterinal villi trees. The trophoblastic shell of some villi was peeled off and degenerated. Developmental retardation of placental villus trees is clearly seen. Some villi were curved and crossing, and gradually thinned to the apex; on the villi surface, many wrinkles and furrows resembling very old skin were observed (Fig. 1) . It is well known that the placental development shows a parallel regulation due to the desidual properties. Cellular and extracellular interactions take place between uterine and trophoblast during initial stages of placentation. 7, 10-12 Khong and Robertson 14 suggested that the deficient decidua is the main reason why tubal pregnancies do not reach to term. The findings they describe may be explained as being due to absent decidua rather than being its cause. Moreover, another reason for the usual failure of ectopic pregnancies to reach term is placenta accreta which becomes placenta percreta with bleeding. 14 According to our SEM observations, in tubal pregnancies the formation and development of placental villi trees were found in some patterns observed in uterinal placental samples. Villi formation patterns-buds, tendrils, and shoots-are very rare on the surface of villi trees (Fig. 2) . Placental villi shoots do not show uniform composition compared with to the uterinal villi samples. These are very thinned to the apex of villi, and are compressed in a common configuration, resembling a racket which does not appear as an alive condition. These observations are very interesting and original. The University of Iowa Central Electron Microscopy Research Facility (CEMRF) was established in 1981 to support all faculty, staff, and students needing this technology. Initially, the CEMRF operated with one transmission electron microscope (TEM), one scanning electron microscope (SEM), and three staff members, and it supported about 30 projects annually. During the past 13 years, all instrumentation predating 1981 has been replaced and now includes two TEMs, two SEMs, two EDS systems, a scanning probe microscope, a laser scanning confocal microscope, and all necessary supporting equipment. The facility presently consists of 14 staff members and supports over 150 projects yearly from 45 departments in 5 colleges and 12 industrial laboratories. One of the unique strengths of the CEMRF is that both biomedical and physical scientists use the facility.",

Of the operating expenses for the facility, 75% are recovered from a large and well-funded group of investigators who are charged on an at-need, fee-for-service, first-come, first-served basis. Faculty recognize that they have a facility available to them that provides immediate access to state-of-the-art equipment and techniques, as well as one that provides training and supervision. In addition to supporting research, the CEMRF offers four formal courses, as well as assisting with sections of eight other classes. The facility annually organizes at least two workshops and provides about 100 tours for visiting scientists, faculty and student recruitment, high school students, business groups, and politicians. The facility also serves as the Business Office for the Iowa Microscopy Society.",

            "text": "Concurrent with the development and success of the CEMRF, several departments voluntarily divested themselves of their own electron microscopy (EM) equipment (28 EMs on campus in 1981 compared with 11 EMs in 1994). This represents a savings of more than $250,000 annually (1994 dollars), as well as the release of 17 or more rooms for other use. In addition, the interaction between the remaining six EM laboratories is more positive as a result of this downsizing and centralization. The availability of user-friendly quality equipment in the CEMRF assures that EM is now accessible to all University faculty, staff, and students. In addition, with many investigators sharing instruments, it is easier to justify acquisition of new equipment for the CEMRF. Accurate dimensional metrology of the submicrometer gold absorber structures of x-ray masks can be accomplished in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) with the use of electron beam modeling (Postek 1993) . Accurate metrology is possible because the x-ray masks present a unique measurement object from most other semiconductor structures viewed in the SEM. This occurs because the silicon support membrane is x-ray transparent by design. This characteristic can be used as a distinct advantage in electron beam-based mask metrology since, depending upon the incident electron beam energies, substrate composition, and substrate thickness, the membrane can also be essentially electron-transparent. The areas of the mask where the absorber structures are located are essentially x-rayopaque, as well as electron-opaque. Viewing the sample from a perspective below the mask by placing an electron detector beneath the mask provides excellent electron signal contrast between the absorber structure and the base membrane. The present technique utilizes a broad acceptance angle detector which is different in concept from other transmission electron (TE) detectors used in the SEM. In this case, the broad angle is used to detect as many of the transmitted electrons as possible (i.e., whether scattered or not) that have an energy above some predetermined threshold which is usually several kiloelectron volts. Then, the electrons are physically filtered both by the signal threshold characteristics of the detector and an by an electron energy filter in front of the detector. Energy filtering of the transmitted electrons excludes the highly scattered and thus lower-energy electrons from entrance into the detector. This greatly improves the contrast level over the conventional transmitted-electron detection mode for this type of application, and greatly simplifies the required electron beam/sample interaction modeling necessary for edge determination. It is, in fact, this change in electron detection philosophy that makes the present TE approach so attractive for dimensional metrology and inspection of x-ray masks.",

The Monte Carlo modeling is more accurate in this work, in contrast to the secondary electron detection mode, because in the transmitted electron detection mode the modeling of the electron beam/specimen interaction becomes far less difficult than in the modeling of typical secondary electron images of other opaque objects. The generated low-energy secondary electrons (which are complex to model) are excluded from the detector and, therefore, do not need to be included in the calculation. Combining all of these factors provides a modeled signal that is extremely sensitive to wall slope. Wall slope variation can result in large differences in the modeled profiles. The comparison between the data from the theoretically modeled electron beam interaction and actual fitted experimental data is shown in Figure 1 for a wall angle of 4\u02da. The theoretical profiles were shown to agree extremely well with experiment, particularly with regard to the wall slope characteristics of the structure obtained from the SEM images and video profiles. A plateau in the transmission is seen in the modeled profile as the beam traverses the edge, which can be used to identify the loca-tion of the edge of the absorber line and thus allows accurate measurements to be made.",

The design of the program is such that the scattering cross sections are reassessed as the electron passes from one region of the specimen into another, which in this case includes free space.

Among the various approaches which allow one to calculate the electron distribution, the Monte Carlo simulation seems to be most suitable. This is due to the fact that the Monte Carlo method generally can be applied to any target. The main problem of this approach is the accuracy of the electron distribution approximation. One important criterion of the quality of the approximation is the coincidence of the calculated and experimentally observed x-rays in depth distribution. Note that the correct calculation of this function plays the essential role in EPMA data interpretation.",

But a more careful comparison of \u03c6(\u03c1z), obtained according to this model with the experimental data 2 for SiK\u03b1 in Al, Ni, Ag, and Au at E = 6, 8, 10 keV, respectively, and CuK\u03b1 at E = 12, 15 keV, reveals some discrepancy, especially in the tail part. This discrepancy increases when the atomic number grows and the electron beam energy decreases. The origin of this discrepancy can be connected with the errors of the approximation of the differential cross sections for elastic and inelastic interactions, as well as with the ionization cross section.",

            "text": "As the Mott formula for elastic cross section uses the model of the atomic potential, then the approximation of this potential can influence the results of the scattering. To avoid the errors connected with the choice of the atomic potential approximation, we have used the elastic differential cross section obtained by Riley et al. 3 with the help of the static approximation theory (SAT). The main features of the developed Monte Carlo program are as follows: 1. The elastic interaction is calculated according to the SAT cross-section 2. The energy dissipation process is described by the knockon model. The Bethe formula for dE/ds is used in the high-energy region (E > 6.338J i ). In the low-energy region (E < 6.338J i ), the equation used in [1] is exploited instead of the Bethe law 3. The fast secondary electrons produced by electron-electron interactions in an inelastic collision are taken into account 4. The mean ionization potential is chosen according to the Berger and Seltzer formula 5. To calculate the ionization cross section, the formula of Gryzinski is used. We have calculated the energy and angular spectra of the electrons transmitted through the films of the various compositions and thicknesses. Comparison of these results with the data obtained with the help of the Mott cross section shows that the use of the SAT approximation for the elastic interaction does not influence essentially the electron distribution and cannot improve the accuracy of its determination. The comparison of \u03c6(\u03c1z) functions which are found in accordance with these two models confirms this conclusion. Therefore, one can state that the details of the Mott cross section together with the errors in atomic potential approximation cannot influence the electron distribution in targets.",

Phenotypic changes result in the expression, synthesis, and organization of complex proteins to form the terminally differentiated myocytes. The formation of the basic pattern of myofibers ultimately determines the physiologic performance of the final form of the heart. Pattern formation involves both intracellular events associated with myofibrillogenesis and extracellular events associated with cell:cell and cell:matrix interactions. This basic pattern is repeated to form complex layers which results in the final form of the heart. It is essential to understand the sequence of expression associated with these patterns of fibers in order to understand errors that may result in congenital defects in heart formation.",

The outflow tract myofibers developed circumferentially and maintained this pattern throughout the study time. The ventricular myofibers also developed circumferentially; however, they gradually changed into a net-like pattern ( Fig. 1) followed by a thickening of the ventricular wall and protrusion of trabeculae. With continued maturation, the ventricular trabeculae appeared to coalesce especially in the re-gion of the muscular interventricular septum (Fig. 2) .

In the quail embryo, the emergence of these cells can be observed as an epithelial to mesenchymal conversion of cells from the mesoderm which may be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after removal of the endoderm 1 or by immunolabelling the whole embryo or sections with a monoclonal antibody (QH-1) which labels angioblasts. 2 The process of angioblast migration and assembly into the solid cords, which are the rudiments of the earliest blood vessels, is called vasculogenesis. 3 Simple embryological manipulations have been used to distinguish the role of cell migration in the early vessel rudiments. The dorsal aortae arise ventrolateral to the forming somites, and inserting blockages revealed that little cell migration is involved in their formation. The endocardial cells which form the endothelial cell lining of the heart, in contrast, undergo an extensive migration from more lateral regions of the embryo which has been studied by blockages and the construction of quail/chick chimeras. 4 IV-64 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) The first rudiments of veins in the embryo are the cardinal veins. These form beneath the ectoderm of the embryo in an area with few angioblasts. The early stages of cardinal vein formation have been studied by using immunogold-labelled secondary antibodies after QH-1 labelling and imaging in the SEM backscatter mode after silver enhancement. These studies revealed that small groups of angioblasts appear over the lateral mesoderm, possibly by migration from the angioblastrich mesoderm adjacent to the endoderm, and then migrate medially to assemble into a solid cord of cells in association with the developing Wolffian duct. 5 The ability of scanning probe technology to image atomic topography of a surface, to manipulate individual atoms, and even to probe the internal structure of a molecule confirms the significance of these super-resolution microscopies used at the nanometer-scale analysis of molecular systems. So far, a number of interactions between the sample and the probe tip gives access to a variety of local properties (Wickramasinghe 1992) . The latest applications of the local probe microscopies on organic molecules include photoemission, tunneling potentiometry, electrostatic, elastic and tribo logic properties, or near-field thermal measurements and as many other phenomena on which various contrast formation mechanisms are based. Topics include imaging of individual biomolecules, highly ordered molecular assemblies, and polymeric materials under various environments. The development of additional imaging techniques,based on near-field electromagnetic interaction between the probe tip and the surface (Betzig and Trautman 1992) , or even by means of magnetic resonance (Rugar et al. 1992) , indicates that new technologies with subnanometer spatial resolution could be achieved in principle.",

            "text": "Recent advances in near-field optical microscopy (NSOM) confirmed spatial resolution in the range of 30-50 nm but still limited by the diameter and optical penetration depth of the aperture. Here, we demonstrated a new concept for an aperture near-field scanning optical microscope which combines force microscopy and optical scattering for imaging the sample at subwavelength resolution without the use of an aperture. The end of a silicon tip is illuminated in transmission mode by a laser beam through a transparent substrate. Both the tip and the sample undergo perpendicular motion, each at a different frequency, with amplitudes chosen comparable to the desired measurement resolution. The scattered light from the tip and the surface is detected at the difference frequency for imaging and sample at sub-wavelength resolution without the use of an aperture. We describe the novel experimental scheme and present the most recent results obtained from our system. The resolution demonstrated to date is 3 nm using helium-neon wavelength and optical line scans are shown in Figure 1 . Finally, a consideration of the basic theory demonstrates that much higher resolution can be easily anticipated. These preliminary results firmly establish the great potential of this new near-field optical microscopy for biological research. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of enamel crystals from remineralized enamel have provided clues as to the changes in crystal diameters within specific zones of artificially created carious-like lesions. 1, 2 These data have supported the evidence obtained through polarized light microscopy of zones of demineralized and remineralized enamel. The dark zone, viewed in polarized light, has been identified as the zone of remineralization. 3 These initial studies were conducted using sputtered coatings of gold/palladium (Au/Pd). High-resolution images of the crystals within the zone of remineralization revealed large crystallites in excess of 120 \u00b5m, often with what appeared to be remineralized \"nodules.\" However, it was difficult to determine whether these were one crystal, or two crystals which had fused during the remineralization phase. A study was conducted using an ultrathin coating of sputtered chromium (Cr) film and SE-I imaging to provide topographic contrasts of crystal surfaces. Since the majority of the SE-I information should be produced close to the surface, the resultant image is specimen-surface specific. 4, 5 Artificial caries-like lesions were prepared in noncarious human teeth (second and third molars) and sectioned into 100 \u00b5m sections which were then viewed in polarized light to identify the dark zone of remineralization. The sections were then fractured through the dark zone producing a spicule of enamel with an edge of fractured enamel free from sectioning artifacts. Each specimen was then mounted onto supports with silver paste with its fractured edge facing up. Measurements were then made to determine the location of the dark zone so that it would be easily located within the SEM. Specimens were degassed and then sputtercoated with 10 nm Au/Pd and 2 nm Cr. 6, 7 Specimens were imaged at high magnification in the SE-I mode by placement on the condenser/objective (c/o) lens stage of an ISI DS-130/LaB 6 SEM at 30 kV and a Hitachi S-900 cold cathode field emission (FE) SEM operated at 20 kV.",

Previous results 1 have shown that the ability of intercalative dyes to modulate the antiviral activity of poly r(A-U) was related to the groove through which the dyes intercalated into the poly r(A-U). When poly r(A-U) was combined with the minor groove intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide (EB) or the minor/major groove intercalating dyes, optimum enhancement of antiviral activity was observed at a dye/ribonucleotide ratio of 1/4. No enhancement of antiviral activity was observed when poly r(A-U) was combined with the major groove intercalating dyes. When EB was combined with poly r(A-U) and then added to human foreskin fibroblast (HSF), the 50% effective dose of the poly r(A-U) was 154-fold lower. The results of additional studies 2 demonstrated that the enhanced antiviral activity was not due to superinduction of interferon, direct viral inactivation, or host cell cytotoxicity. Phase contrast, fluorescence, and confocal micrographs of HSF cells following a 3-h exposure to 50 \u00b5M EB alone or a 50 \u00b5M EB/200 \u00b5M poly r(A-U) combination stained the nucleolus, but not the chromatin.",

Under the conditions employed in this study, poly r(A-U) exhibits an elongated conformation (200-300 nm in length) that possesses a number of hairpin loops as well as single-stranded and double-stranded domains (Fig. 1a,b) . The double-stranded domains are found predominantly at the base of 30 nm hairpin loops. In contrast to the poly r(A-U) alone, micrographs of the EB/poly r(A-U) combination illustrate the presence of condensed structures with diameters ranging from 15 to 85 nm. Results from scanning force microscopy corroborate the results of both TEM preparations. TEM of unstained and uranyl-stained EB/poly r(A-U)-treated HSF cells illustrate the endocytosis of electrondense material into acidic compartments of the HSF cells. 3 Subsequently, the electron-dense material escaped from the acidic compartment and formed electron-dense bodies with dimensions that closely approximate the dimensions of the EB/poly r(A-U) combination visualized in the negative staining preparations. These electron-dense bodies are detected near the nuclear membrane and in the nucleolus. The nucleolus of an unstained, EB/poly r(A-U)-treated HSF cell demonstrates the segregation of the nucleolar components so that the fine fibrillar component, which comprises the nucleolar organizer region, is being peripheral to a dense granular material occupying the major central area of the nucleolus. 3 The results of the current study and our previous work suggest that the elevated antiviral activity of the EB/poly r(A-U) combination may be related to the ability of the EB to complex with poly r(A-U) and condense it into a conformation with dimensions that can be accommodated by endocytotic vesicles. Exit from the acidic compartment is promoted by unbound EB that induces endosomal or lysosomal swelling. Subsequently, changes in the topology and surface charge of the poly r(A-U) induced by the EB allow increased access to the nucleolus which results in the modulation of additional cellular processes, especially rRNA synthesis and processing. Aromatic constituents in plant cell walls are associated with other wall components and affect strength and other characteristics of plant cell walls. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption microspectrophotometry has been useful in characterizing aromatics within specific cell types in plant organs. 1, 2, 3 This technique was applied to walls of bran and endosperm cells in a series of hard and soft wheats.",

Tomography is a form of imaging whereby a section or \"tome\" can be taken through a specimen by using x-rays, and details above and below the sectional area of interest will be blurred out, giving a fairly clear image of this area. This technique is nondestructive to the sample. The method is similar to that de- scribed by Lindegaard-Andersen and Thuesen, 1 originally proposed by Watson. 2 In their method, the x-ray source is stationary and the subject and recording film are rotated synchronously. The x-ray beam strikes the film at near glancing incidence producing transaxial summation images. However, the associated point spread function has a 1/R radial dependency, which means that smearing of detail will have occurred. The results are sufficiently encouraging, nevertheless, to stimulate the search for improved contrast and resolution, with provision for three-dimensional mapping of internal structures.",

Epithelial cells were examined systematically using EM, from apex to base, to study the three processes associated with digestion: uptake, breakdown, and transport. Using TEM, granules and LDL particles were observed to enter the cells in uptake structures, the microplicae and coated pits, respectively. When samples were viewed using SEM (Fig. 1) , these uptake structures appeared as fossae of different sizes, which have not previously been described in the literature. Yolk granules and LDL particles were observed by TEM, within the cells, in phagosomes, endosomes, and acid phosphatase-containing vacuoles (secondary lysosomes), components of an active intracellular digestion system as it is presently known.

Laser scanning confocal microscopy and digital image processing were used to visualize the pattern of de novo blood vessel formation in the quail embryo. Stage 9 quail embryos were fixed on the yolk, excised, then immunolabeled with QH1, an antibody marker for angioblasts and vascular endothelial cells . After incubation in fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies, the embryos were mounted in PBS/glycerol (1:9 ratio) under a #1 glass coverslip. Specimens were examined on a BioRad MRC1000 confocal laser scanning device equipped with Zeiss optics. A 10\u00d7 objective lens was used to image the entire caudal half of each embryo during the laser scanning step. Ten 7 \u00b5M optical sections were acquired in a plane parallel to the embryonic axis (en face). The ten optical sections were then collapsed into one composite image using BioRad's proprietary software (Fig. 1) . The image was imported into Photoshop \u2122 software on a Macintosh Quadra 950.

The type of image shown in Figure 2 facilitates comparison of endothelial sprouts and anastomotic foci during formation of the first vasculature in the quail embryo. Based on images from embryos at progressively older developmental stages, we suggest that morphogenesis of the lateral anastomotic network occurs by mechanisms that involve angioblastic tractional structuring of the extracellular matrix (Madri et al. 1983 , Montesano et al. 1983 , Stopack and Harris 1982 .

Sections were cut both parallel to the protein fibres (longitudinal) and across the fibres. For LM, sections were stained with ice-cold oil red O and methyl- ene blue. Because the fat is not well fixed by aldehyde fixation, slides were held on a bed of ice during staining to prevent fat migration. For SEM, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate in methanol, washed in methanol, and stained with lead citrate, dried, mounted on aluminum stubs, and gold-coated. This procedure removed most of the free fat and water/whey, allowing the association of the protein fibres to be clearly visualized. Increased stretching temperature increased the size of the fat globules, which was particularly noticeable in cross sections. With 54\u00b0C stretching, the fat globules were relatively small and uniformly distributed across the section, while with 60\u00b0C and 66\u00b0C stretching there were almost two populations of globules: some small and some very large. In longitudinal sections, the protein strands formed during stretching at 54\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C were slender and smooth, while those formed during stretching at 66\u00b0C were thicker and less regular. Little difference was seen with storage time in either longitudinal or cross sections for the three different stretching temperatures using LM. With SEM, however, after removal of the fat, the ability of the fibres to hold together decreased with storage time. This is best seen in longitudinal sections, where the protein fibres are closely associated in cheese stored for 3 days (Fig. 1) , and are able to withstand the stress of drying, while in cheese stored for 7 weeks (Fig. 2) , the fibres have been weakened (presumably by proteolytic activity from coagulant and culture enzymes) and pulled apart as the section dried.",

            "text": "Milk is a canvas of seemingly silent molecular structure. There is a large variety of \"resident molecules\" with molecular harmony in milk which are of mammary gland origin. In general, the \"structural matrix\" of milk comprises three classes of biomolecules: molecules in suspension (casein micelles), molecules in solution (lactose, proteins, vitamins, and salts) , and molecules in emulsion (fat globules). Because of its excellent nutritive composition, milk is ubiquitous and the most popular \"ready-to-consume\" food from time immemorial. Today, in IV-74 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) FIG . different parts of the world, milk from various species of animals is used for food. In the U.S., however, the cow furnishes virtually all of the available market milk, whereas in my country more than 55% of the total milk produced is of Buffalo origin. Hence, structural studies particularly on milk and milkfood products made from various animal species are more fascinating and challenging from a global angle. It is the local consumer habits that determine the final structural orientation of the product in the country of origin, especially in a country such as India where 50 to 55% of milk produced is converted into a variety (30 plus) of traditional milk products, using processes such as coagulation (heat and/or acid), desiccation, and formulation. Hence, a presentation on the \"structural style\" of milkfoods which are developed on the basis of \"environment-friendly green technology\" in the tropical countries might generate a new dimensional need for future studies on milkfood products. A comprehensive literature scan of published papers in the areas of \"Food\" and \"Food Structure\" during the last 30 years reveals the following publication status: During the period 1968 to 1991:",

Lactose plays a commanding role in a so-called instantisation process. While making a presentation before a \"highly-structured\" qualified scientist using SEM and TEM, it is tempting for me to present our own work of limited nature. In our laboratory, during the last decade, we carried out a SEM study on Buffalo milk and its casein. 3 The micelles are of larger size and have higher-bound calcium unlike cow casein micelles. Regarding the casein fractions, an elaborate study on the B-casein in relation to structure and function as affected by heat and enzymic cleavage were carried out. Work relating to microstructure development on another Indian milk product, namely \"PANEER,\" from buffalo and cow milk has been reported. 4 More recently, while working on casein micelles in CSIRO Dairy Research Laboratory in Australia, the author made an original contribution when ascertaining the micellar integrity of casein micelles in milk. 5 He used a very simple technology not dependent on SEM or TEM. It was on the \"colour communication\" property of molecules as an integrated system or in isolation. Using this new technique, it is possible to declare the miscellar integrity and to identify milk from different animal species, based on the different miscellar structure-dependent light-reflecting phenomena.",

The SO, with the highest insaturation content, presented the higher swelling power. The addition of the monoglyceride (GMS) led to the lowest value. The relative sizes of the swollen granules shown on the micrographs of Figure 1 confirm these observations. GMS forms a helical inclusion complex with amylose, which might delay the transport of water into the granule and consequently decreases the swelling power (Eliasson 1985) .

Numerous bacteria spores were seen at high magnification, particularly durum wheat and barley. Light photomicrographs showed a heterogenous population of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria. The bacteria consisted of different shapes such as short rods, long rods, and cocci. Transmission electron photomicrographs revealed the isolated strains to consist of one or more flagella attached to the membrane surfaces. At least three of the bacterial strains isolated were encapsulated. We exposed, selectively, twelve of the isolated bacterial strains to a variety of antibodies, pesticides, and insecticides. As a result, 5 of the 12 bacterial strains tested showed resistance to both ampicillin and bacitracin (50 \u00b5l/mg). Of the 12 strains, 7 showed resistance to insecticides (SEVIN) and the pesticides (ENFORCER) as high as 100 \u00b5l/mg. Three of the five strains that were resistant to both ampicillin and bacitracin were also resistant to the insecticide SEVIN at high concentrations (100 \u00b5l/mg).

The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis, has been of significant importance to research since its successful axenic culture 70 years ago. The drug's tranquilizing effects on humans may possibly be elucidated by investigating CDZ-induced impairment of the protozoan's growth and motility through modifying microtubular-directed ciliary function (Bell et al. 1994) . Here, uptake, recovery, and attempted localization of CDZ, as well as its alterations of cellular ultrastructure are reported. Thin layer chromatography of CDZ (Hoffman LaRoche, Nutley, N.J.) in three different mobile phases revealed optimal CDZ stability when dissolved and stored in isoamyl alcohol; benzene. After 3 days of liquid culture, T. pyriformis removed 15% of the radioactivity from [14C] -CDZ in the growth medium. Liquid scintillation counting of cell washes during the 5-day time course suggested surface, nonspecifically-bound radioactivity. Following 5 days of culture, [ 14 C] -CDZ together with its metabolites and/or breakdown products were recovered from homogenates of Tetrahymena. To detect the intracellular sites of CDZ localization and possible action, both transmission electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy were performed. The former revealed that CDZ disrupted cytoplas-buffer or cacodylate-buffered DOPA revealed DOPA/PPO reaction product but failed to reveal a definitive, substrate localization of the enzyme. Instead, cytoplasmic morphologic distortions of buffered DOPA-treated hyphae were apparent, mandating modification of the employed higher-plant, cytochemical procedure for localizing fungal PPO. Thus, attempts to establish the route of PPO secretion to the growth medium utilizing liquid cultured hyphae may be of limited value as the sheath appears to be sloughed during shake culture. In this connection, C. versicolor grows upon a solid substratum when decaying timber in situ. Support: DOE-BCTR Program. The evaluation of surface topography is conventionally done with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) by visually reconstructing stereo images in a stereo viewer. The monocular clues in an SEM image, shown for example in the image in Figure 1 , can also be used to map the topography of a sample surface. The first attempt to identify the surface gradient from a secondary electron detector in this way was reported by Suganuma (1985) who found that (1) and described the inclination of the surface to the specimen plane, where A and B are the signal outputs from the two detectors and A n and B n are the signal outputs from the same material when it is perfectly horizontal.",

The latter may be associated with sensory ganglia related to pressure sensation, but their function has not been determined. These results form the basis for comparison of normal bladder vasculature with that of experimentally compromised vasculature. The epithelial cell layer lining the nasal turbinates of humans is functionally and histologically consistent with that of the lower airways. This anatomic site is easily sampled using an inexpensive, disposable curette, and the epithelium obtained can be evaluated for both clinical and experimental objectives. The original rationale for ultrastructural evaluation of clinical specimens of nasal epithelium in this facility was to document index ciliary lesions consistent with the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Figs. 1, 2 ) among individuals considered at risk. Patients referred for study encompassed both adult and pediatric populations and had lifelong histories of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and/or otitis media, but with normal immunoglobulin levels. Several patients presenting with situs inversus, polysplenia, or infertility problems-clinical findings considered risk factors for PCD-also were evaluated. Approximately 25 nasal biopsies are submitted annually for evaluation, of which approximately 8% demonstrate impaired ciliary motion and ultrastructural abnormalities that could be the basis for altered ciliary motion and a diagnosis of PCD. This finding is consistent with the suspected prevalence of PCD in the general population although the rate appears higher among individuals of Scandinavian descent, Pacific islanders, and inbred populations. The diagnosis of PCD is confirmed by the electron microscopic documentation of any of three ultrastructural level lesions of airway cilia. These lesions are: (1) dysmorphology of dynein arms, (2) absent radial spokes, and (3) microtubular transpositions. In our experience, dysmorphology of the dynein arms represents the major form of ciliary abnormality associated with PCD. Missing radial spokes and microtubular transpositions have not been documented among any of our patients. These clinical studies also have provided a unique opportunity for defining a spectrum of ciliary abnormalities which distinguish the heritable primary ciliary abnormalities associated with PCD from acquired cil- iary abnormalities associated with chronic disease or acute injury due to infectious processes or exposure to irritant gases in the ambient air. In addition, other histopathologic features such as mucus cell hyperplasia have been encountered occasionally among children presenting with chronic respiratory disease and referred for evaluation. In summary, our experience shows that ultrastructural evaluation of nasal epithelium can provide a clinically significant perspective on respiratory health.

Using conventional light microscopy, silicone has been described as a translucent, clear, mucoid, refractile material which is often difficult to visualize. It is not birefringent, as is silica, by polarized light microscopy. Silicone gel tends to form homogenous, rounded \"globules,\" \"vacuoles,\" or \"droplets\" unlike the angulated, sharp spicules observed with silica. In paraffin-embedded tissue sections, silicone gel often appears to be slightly out of the plane of focus. In addition, silicone gel \"globules\" occasionally drop out of standard 4 \u00b5m histologic sections during tissue processing, leaving partially or totally vacant holes or \"cysts.\" Because silicone extravasation and deposition into surrounding fibrous breast capsules is difficult to visualize by standard light microscopy techniques, 1 the electron microscopist must often \"blindly\" examine multiple fields/grids in a labor-intensive fashion. To decrease the time generally required for the positive identification of silicon by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), alternative light microscopy techniques for preliminary screening purposes were investigated.",

In Figure 1 , cells were evaporative-dried under a mild aspirator vacuum after GTGO fixation and dehydration in acetonitrile (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%-3\u00d7, 5 min each). As a comparison, cells in Figure 2 were identically fixed and criticalpoint dried after ethanol dehydration. The overall appearance of the cells from both treatments is similar at low magnification (Figs. 1a, 2a) , with some shrinkage evident in either case.

The results of this study are encouraging and may lead to future studies to develop a simple fixation protocol which enables evaporative drying from solvents directly miscible with water such as acetonitrile.

A snow crystal is a single frozen ice grain that generally results from a process known as nucleation in which atmospheric water vapor condenses on a solid particle or nucleus at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. When nucleation occurs, the water molecules form a hexagonal crystal lattice resulting from the specific orientation and binding that occurs between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Depending on the temperature and moisture that prevails during formation and descent of snow crystals, nucleation may result in plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, or dendrites-all of which are based on the hexagonal lattice structure. An individual snow crystal may range in size from 50 \u00b5m to 5 mm (Gray 1981 ); aggregations of two or more of these crystals form a snowflake.",

A successful procedure consisted of placing a thin layer of methyl cellulose solution on a holder and precooling it to the prevailing outside temperature during a snow fall. Next, snowflakes were allowed to settle on the surface of the methyl cellulose solution. After a few minutes, the holder was plunged into liquid nitrogen and transferred to the laboratory where it was retrieved from liquid nitrogen, mounted on the transfer rod of an Oxford CT-1500 HR Cryosystem, moved into the prechamber for sputter coating with Au/Pd, and then inserted into a Hitachi S-4100 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a cold stage that was maintained at \u2212185\u00b0C.",

At low magnification, the specimens, which did not appear to be altered by the sputter coating, resembled those that had been previously photographed with the light microscope. The snow crystals were stable in the beam, did not sublime, and could be observed at magnifications of 20,000\u00d7 or more to reveal microcrystalline water deposits or rime on the surface of some the snow crystals. This procedure, which was used to collect specimens during several snow falls in Beltsville, Maryland during the 1993-1994 winter season, was also capable of preserving sleet, graupel, and hail. Furthermore, storage holders were devised that allowed capture of the snowflakes and their storage in liquid nitrogen until the specimens could be processed for examination in the SEM. Finally, the specimen stage of the SEM allowed specimen tilt so that stereo images of the snow crystals could be recorded (Fig. 1) .",

Furthermore, the ability to collect and store samples enables investigators to accumulate samples from numerous locations or different time intervals so that detailed observations and comparisons can be done in a convenient and orderly manner. These were identified and returned into the corresponding reconstruction sections in an automatic tracing procedure, programmed and executed on VIDAS 2.5 (ZEISS/KONTRON Germany). In addition it is possible to obtain a plastic, 3-D-like impression by applying the RCM with oblique illumination. This is achieved by decentralization of Stach's slide (central diaphragm). 2. Two main problems in 3-D reconstruction of histologic specimens are the horizontal distortion during the preparation of serial thin-tissue slides and the following vertical readjustment (alignment). We have recently shown that optical sections can be obtained by RCM within thick tissue-slides. 3 Its confocal-like principle provides an alternative to mechanical slices. The preserved integrity of the examined object allows the precise movement within the optical axis in one (vertical) dimension, thus avoiding manual alignment. Applying the RCM on histochemical and immunohistochemical stains, reflections can be observed within the tissue. 4 The depth of penetration of the light beam amounts to approx. 30 \u00b5m, equivalent to about 30 optical tomolevels (Fig. 2) .",

With this increase in usage, a concomitant increase in the need for both better developed specimen preparation techniques and better defined operational parameters for the AFM instrument has occurred. Lifesciences AFM methodology can be divided into three main areas: (1) Choosing the appropriate support substrate for the specimen, (2) choosing the most appropriate immobilization techniques for attaching the specimen to the support substrate, and (3) selection of the optimum instrument scan parameters to ensure reliable transfer of data from the specimen to the image.",

            "text": "Of central importance to life-science AFM is the nature of the substrate to be used. The most reliable substrates are those with a well-documented surface, whose features are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the specimens of interest. Furthermore, the material should be transparent so that other forms of microscopy can be used (i.e., light, fluorescence, near-field scanning optical, etc.) and the surface chemistry should be both well documented and susceptible to chemical derivitization. The two most common substrates to fit the above descriptions are glass and freshly cleaved mica. Both of these surfaces can easily be manipulated to produce a wealth of reactive primary amines, either by coating the substrate with poly-L-lysine or by treatment with 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES). An analysis of the modified and unmodified substrates show that treatment with either APTES or poly-L-lysine resulted in an increase in surface roughness (Ra). Based on the roughness information, we recommend modified mica as being suitable for biological material ranging from whole cells to DNA, whereas modified glass is unsuitable for samples with heights < 2.5 nm. The red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Samples were placed on either glass or mica and imaged in air. No fixative or stain was used; this allowed modification of the samples between images so that molecular components could be identified. The meshlike structure, which is observed when the RBCs are lysed, is identified as a complex of the cytoskeletal integral proteinsspectrin, actin, and band 4.1. The identification was accomplished by imaging the intact cytoskeleton, then treating the sample to selectively remove these proteins and re-imaging the sample. To support the identification of the cytoskeletal proteins further, images were obtained of samples which had been treated with detergent to remove the lipid membrane and leave the cytoskeleton behind. This is the first study of the intact RBC cytoskeleton which identifies specific proteins. More generally, it shows that AFM is a useful tool for examining biological systems in their native state since sample preparation is simple and, once attached to the substrate, the sample can be treated in a variety of ways. We have reported some features about the structural and morphologic changes in nylon 3 transformed from \u03b2-alanine single crystal and nylon 6 polymerized from \u03b5-amino-ncaproic acid one, which are members of the \u03c9-amino acid family, through the solid-state polycondensation procedure. It was also found that p-aminohippuric acid [N-(4-aminobenzoyl)glycine] single crystal could be converted into an aromatic polyamide crystal by heat treatment below its melting point. In this report, crystalline and morphologic structures of polyglycine produced from glycine (the simplest amino acid) single crystal were examined mainly by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction technique.",

The monomer single crystal was precipitated at 30\u00b0C from the solution, which was transparent and prism-shaped. Definitive cleavage planes were observed in the monomer crystal, which is found to be parallel to the a-c plane in the \u03b1form crystal of glycine. It has been reported that such cleavage is caused by the characteristic structure of \u03b1-form glycine crystal. The monomer single crystal was used as the original specimen for the polycondensation reaction, where the original specimen was annealed in decaline at 130 and 190\u00b0C up to 1000 h. Morphology of the polymerized material was observed by using a Hitachi S-410 SEM with accelerating voltage of 5 kV after being coated with gold. X-ray photographs were taken by a flat camera mounted on an x-ray generator with Ni-filtered Cu-K\u03b1 radiation, where the crystal took three orientational positions so that a-c (cleavage plane), a-b, and b-c planes made a right angle with the incident beam, respectively. Figure 1 shows two types of x-ray diffraction patterns from a specimen polymerized at 130\u00b0C for 800 h with the a-c plane perpendicular (Fig. la) and parallel (Fig. lb) to the incident beam, where patterns reflected from the polymerized material were observed as well to have spots from the original monomer single crystal. In Figure la , two strong arcs are observed, which are indexed as 100 (inner reflection) and 001 (outer reflection) from type-I modification of polyglycine crystal. A more complicated diffraction pattern is shown in Figure lb , which seems to be a fiber diagram. Almost all molecular chains in polyglycine-I crystal are considered to be normal to the a-c plane and parallel to the hydrogen bond in the original monomer single crystal. Figure 2a shows a SEM photograph for the surface of the original monomer crystal. Lamination layers of lamellae are observed on the cleavage plane, edges of which are parallel to the b-axis of the monomer crystal. Voids were observed in the grain boundary or crack region. A SEM picture of the specimen polymerized at 130\u00b0C for 300 h is shown in Figure 2b , where the laminal materials are seen to overlap each other crosswise. Such intersecting laminal structure seems to be responsible for the biaxial crystalline orientation observed in the x-ray diffraction pattern shown in Figure la. In the case of the specimen polymerized at higher temperatures, the fibrillar structure was observed over the surface. Figure 2c shows the results for the specimen annealed at 190\u00b0C for 10 h.",

Such phenomena may be explained by stiffness of the molecular chain including F instead of H, that is, the chain does not fold even if the molecular motion is stimulated at elevated temperatures. Any sheaf-like or microspherulitic structure (a precursor of the spherulite), which is often observed in thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene, did not appear in PTFE. When decreasing the cooling rate, the fibrils grow laterally and interfibrillar space tends to become larger. It is unknown how such space affects the physical properties of the material. Thinner fibrils appeared, which connected the original thick ones, in the case of 0.1\u00b0C/min cooling as shown in Figure 2 .

The signal used for image formation and subsequent phase discrimination is the backscattered electron (BSE) image; however, the abovementioned relief due to differences in hardness made the distinction between glass and corundum impossible, since (a) brightness differences between glass and corundum are not very strong in the first place, and (b) edge effects in the corundum crystals showed brightness values of the glass, and vice versa (discrimination, i.e., tranformation of a particular phase into a binary image, is based on such brightness differences). Contrast enhancement or image filters were not sufficient for clear separation of these two phases. Therefore, for the recognition of the glass phase, an element distribution for Si (x-ray map) was used; combined with the image of ZrO2, which is easily discriminated from other phases because of its high average atomic number/high backscatter signal, it yields the inverse of the corundum image. This sounds quite simple; however, since the resolution of the x-ray signal is considerably less than the BSE signal, quite some effort had to be put into the treatment of the Si-distribution to give correct areas and outlines of the glass phase.",

            "text": "The measurement of strain, using lattice parameter changes, can be determined from channeling patterns in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using HOLZ lines. The method used by Kuzubowski, 1 for example, in the [001] orientation of silicon, utilizes the change of the height of the triangle from the intersections of the (660) and two {571} HOLZ lines. More recently we have been investigating the channeling patterns for silicon to calibrate accurately the voltage in an SEM and we have utilized a pin wheel pattern formed from the {5 11 1} HOLZ lines in [001] pattern at 26.86 keV. At this voltage, the (5 -1 -1 -1) and (5 11 1) are very close to each other, within 0.005 degrees, and these two lines split as the voltage increases or decreases. The width of the splitting is quite sensitive to any voltage changes as are the {991} intersections with these lines. An experimental electron channeling pattern (ECP) of these lines, along with a simulation are shown in Figure 1 . The voltage calibrated from the simulation is 27.28 keV as shown in Figure 1c . These same HOLZ lines are, of course, also appropriate for strain measurement since the variation in the voltage is equivalent to an isotropic strain field that would uniformly change the lattice spacings. The shifting of the HOLZ lines in the electron channeling patterns due to strain are from both the change in the magnitude of Bragg angle and the change in the orientation of the diffracting planes. The former corresponds to a change in the distance of reciprocal lattice point from the origin(i.e., d spacing) and the latter is due to the rotation of reciprocal lattice point about the origin. Thus the total angular change can be written as where \u03b8 B is the Bragg angle, \u2206\u03b8 P is the rotation of the plane, g is the diffraction vector, \u03bb is the electron wavelength, and | | represents the length of a vector. E is a matrix equal to \u03b5 + I where \u03b5 is the strain tensor and I a unit matrix. The approximation ~ is due to the small angle approximation for sin(\u2206\u03b8 B )~\u2206\u03b8 B and 1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b8 B 2~ 1. The HOLZ lines toward the center of the channeling patterns are more sensitive to lattice parameter variations because they have a larger value of g and the change of the Bragg angle is in proportion to this magnitude. The angular IV-98 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) \u2206\u03b8 = \u2206\u03b8 B + \u2206\u03b8 P~E g \u2212 g widths of these channeling lines are also smaller and so they are well defined. 2 When the strain is not isotropic, the sensitivity is also determined by the orientation relationship between the strain ellipsoid and the g vector. Thus the appropriate choice of the g vector can be used to maximize the second term in the equation. In Figure 2a , for example, we show the simulation of a channeling pattern for a strain along only one direction (e.g., [100] ) which breaks the four-fold symmetry of the [001] pattern. It can be seen that the strain effects on the {991} are all the same since all the planes in this family are symmetrical to the strain direction. However, the sensitivities to the strain in the {5 11 1} are not all equal, (11 5 1) being more sensitive than (5 11 1). The comparison of the sensitivity can be seen from the simulation and from Figure 2b , in which the angles of splitting are plotted as a function of the strain. For years LaB 6 has been the industry standard for thermionic emission cathode material. In 1991, FEI introduced CeB 6 as an improved alternative to LaB 6 . CeB 6 directly replaces LaB 6 and has certain distinct benefits. CeB 6 has a lower volatility than LaB 6 , increasing the lifetime of the cathode. This reduces the frequency of cathode purchases and replacements. In addition, greater beam stability and faster startup are achievable from CeB 6 's greater resistance to contamination. However, to gain the benefits of CeB 6 , it must be operated correctly. Studies have shown that the operating characteristics of CeB 6 , such as total emission current, are different from LaB 6 . Proper operation of CeB 6 comes from understanding the operating characteristics of CeB 6 and how they interact with the system in which it is operating. To compare the operating characteristics of CeB 6 and LaB 6 , we performed parametric studies in a JEOL 6400 scanning electron microscope. The JEOL 6400 is a self-biased system where the bias voltage (Vb) is dependent upon the total emission current as Vb = Ie*Rb, where Rb is the bias resistor and Ie is the total emission current.",

The effects of adjusting the Wehnelt-to-tip distance vary for different electron microscope systems.",

So far, special SEMs combined with various scanners and interferometers (Postek 1989 , Hatsuzawa et al. 1990 ) are necessary to perform absolute and precise measurements; however, this device solved the problem by miniaturizing a one-dimensional mechanical scanner and a multi-optical path interferometer.",

The square part, slit by using a electric discharging machine, is suspended by thin elastic suspensions at each corner. The table is driven by a piezo-electric actuator of a traveling length of 10 micrometers. A He-Ne laser beam is introduced on the disk by a single mode fiber through a collimator lens, and it is split and deflected by beam splitters and lenses so that two beams are facing each other and form a differential interferometer. At both ends of the table, right-angle prisms are facing each other so that the laser beam goes back and forth five times. By using the differential arrangement and optical-path multiplication technique, the resolution of the interferometer is improved ten times from the original Michelson's arrangement. The reflected beams are surperimposed by a half-mirror to generate an interferometric signal, and it is detected by four photo diodes (PD0-PD270) after changing its phase by 90\u02da through a half-and a quarter-wave plate arrangement. This detection method and an electrically operational processing enhance the resolution 40 IV-100 Scanning Vol. 16, Supplement IV (1994) times from its original.

The fiber and electric wires are introduced through two flanges next to the chamber. A software servosystem is constructed by using the interferometer and a piezo driver. According to the positional information read through the interferometer counter, a D/A converter commands the piezo driver to change table position precisely, allowing simultaneous sampling of the secondary electron intensity distribution. In the system, the resolution is improved to 0.4 nm (\u00e2\u03bb/1600) by using the counter function. Thus, a precise measurement system is realized for the absolute measurement of micro-linewidth in a regular SEM. A maximum drift of the interferometer counter of 5 nm/h was observed by fluctuations in room temperature, however, the influence of the drift can be neglected in actual measurements since a line-scan is finished within a dozen seconds.",

Clonal isolates of the fungus were identified as Zygorhizidium planktonicum (Chytridiomycetes), an obligate parasite of freshwater diatoms. Although frequently present in lakes and reservoirs of Western Europe, the occurrence of Z. planktonicum in North America has not been previously confirmed. Earlier studies have described the morphology of Z. planktonicum on Asterionella formosa; however, little is known of the fine structure and infection process on S. acus. As a basis for further investigations, morphology and mechanism of infection were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. These observations provided exceptional accounts of germinating spores and developing thalli. Moreover, conjugation was characterized as the fusion of heterogametangia by means of an extended smooth-walled tube, emanated from the smaller \"male\" gametangium. Upon attachment, the club-shaped conjugation tube adhered to a small region of the adjoining thallus. This point of contact became continuous with the maturing \"female\" gametangium which appeared smooth-walled and often highly vacuolate. Ultrastructural examinations also illustrated a shared cytoplasm between conjugating gametangia and apparent migration of organelles; however, fusion of nuclei was not observed. The mechanism of infection on S. acus appeared identical to earlier descriptions of Z. planktonicum on A. formosa (Beakes et al. 1992) . Following encystment, spores typically produced a single germ tube which grew over the frustule valve in an unwavering, linear fashion. Penetration occurred between an overlapping region of the outer and inner frustule. At the point of intrusion, the rhizoid appeared slightly swollen, often further displacing the outer diatom wall.",

To localize exogenously administered CDZ, a polyclonal antibody to the drug conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) was prepared by immunizing New Zealand rabbits and subsequent bleeds. The antibody titer was both detected and quantified by an indirect ELISA assay (Pierce ELISA Starter Kit). The detected antibody was separated from other serum proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography utilizing Pharmacia's Mab Trap G and then tagged with 5 nm immunogold particles. Transmission immunoelectron microscopy employing tagged antibody and glutaraldehyde/ paraformaldehyde-fixed, DMF dehydrated, and Lowicryl-embedded CDZ-treated and nontreated Tetrahymena revealed no immunogold association with either microtubules or any other cytoplasmic organelle. This suggested that intracellular CDZ was cytosolic and leached out during EM processing. Thus, CDZ appears to impair growth and motility through an effect on general metabolism, for example, protein synthesis and/or respiration, rather than a direct action upon microtubules. However, isolation, purification, and characterization of microtubular proteins from Tetrahymena cultured with and without CDZ are required to substantiate this tentative conclusion. Support: NSF-RIMI Grant No. RII-8912781. Coriolus versicolor, a white-rot, wood-decay basidiomycetous fungus, elaborates extracellular ligno-cellulolytic enzymes which possess marked industrial and agricultural applications. Thus, we have been attempting to overproduce and enhance/regulate the secretion of these enzymes employing polyphenol oxidase (PPO) as a model enzyme. It catalyzes the conversion of o-diphenols (tree-generated resistance factors) to o-diquinones and oligomerizes syringic acid, alignin derivative. Previously, we (Moore et al. 1994 ) employed biochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy to map the route of PPO secretion through intracellular endomembrane and possible wall-associated components for hyphae cultured in defined liquid (biochemistry) and solid (microscopy) media. Here, the ultrastructures of C. versicolor hyphae cultured in Kirk and Kelman's defined liquid or solid media are compared. In addition, ultrastructural cytochemistry to define further the intracellular route of PPO secretion to the growth medium in liquid cultured hyphae is described. Hyphae of various culture ages (5-12 days) were prefixed 30 min in 2.5-3.0% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.05 M cacodylate/cacodylic acid, pH 7.4 and after washing with buffer postfixed for 1h in buffered 2% 0 s 0 4 . For cytochemistry, prefixed hyphae were washed and treated with either cacodylate buffer or buffered 50 mg ml -1 TLC pure, dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) on ice, followed by 1h at 37\u00b0C and then 0 s 0 4 postfixed. The hyphae were dehydrated through a graded acetone series and embedded in Spurr's low epoxy resin. The ultrastructures of hyphae cultured in defined medium containing or lacking agar were similar (Fig. 1A , B) except that hyphae grown upon agar possessed a sheath (HS) external to the cell wall. Comparisons of numerous micrographs of aldehyde-fixed hyphae treated with cacodylate CHRISTIAN H. RICKERT AND TIMM J. FILLER Institute of Anatomy, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t, M\u00fcnster, Germany Until today, quantification in cytochemistry has mainly been performed on supracellular level and by subjective estimation which makes it difficult to compare results of different investigations, even for standardized cytochemical procedures. Reasons for this are the lack either or of calibrations or of relative reference points. Greyscale image analysis principally allows the quantification of dye-density, but in practice stain intensities depend on many technical circumstances, that is, slide thickness, density of materials, light conditions, or costaining effects, and do not allow automatic identification because of weak grey-contrast. Thus, greyscale image analysis for cytochemical quantification on subcellular level necessitates four prerequisites: (1) applicability within tissue-slides combined with high resolving power, (2) thin optical tomolevels to avoid superimposition of stained structures, (3) clear distinction of structures (specificity), and (4) high contrast.",

            "text": "The reflection contrast microscope (RCM; LEICA Germany) meets the above mentioned requirements. It combines effective suppression of aspecific reflected light with epi-illumination. Because of its confocal-like principle, the RCM can be applied on thick tissue slides to obtain distinct optical sections. 1, 4 At a magnification of 100\u00d7, the depth of these sections amounts to approximately 1-2 \u00b5m, circumventing an accumulative effect as seen in transillumination. 2 Some cytochemical stains show specific reflections in the RCM, increasing the detection sensitivity to a level of objects 15 nm in size. 1, 3 Reflections are like a binary signal (all-or-nothing principle) and deliver an intense contrast against a dark background, thus facilitating image processing by substituting the common density measurements with field measurement corresponding to areas of reflections.We designed an analysis program on VIDAS 2.5 (ZEISS/KONTRON Germany) for quantification of RCM images. One of the main parts of this application handles the greyvalue manipulation. Apart from standard routines for image optimization and automatic region selection, the mean greyvalue of the whole image was determined. This was used as a reference parameter for the identification threshold in order to minimize the deviation of the identified area from the real area of reflection caused by inconsistencies of the light intensity.Applying the RCM with consecutive image analysis on Gomori-stained neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), we verified the validity of our measuring routine by employing it on a recognized system. A linear correlation between the process of neurosecretion and nuclear volume of the SON is well known. Switching from RCM to bright field, it is possible to obtain topographically identical images of the chosen tissue region. Thus, we photographed reflecting neurosecretory granules in the former while karyometry was performed on the latter. The nuclei were classified by area and matched with the corresponding nucleus area of the same cell. A linear regression of these parameters was computed within a 95% confidence interval. Our results in general confirm former findings about the measurable relationship between nuclear size and specific cell activity, surpassing earlier methods by increasing the sensitivity and decreasing the duration.This paper introduces the RCM combined with digital processing as a useful tool for quantification in the investigative gap between light and electron microscopy. The reflection contrast microscope (RCM; LEICA Germany) is a light microscopic instrument, making reflections along interfaces visible by means of centrally polarized epi-illumination. These reflections cause interference patterns that are suitable for the analysis of superficies or detection of contact zones 1 . We present two properties of this widely unknown technique allowing three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions in the following manners:",

Applying the RCM on the surface of air-dried unstained erythrocytes, we made use of the phenomenon that neighbouring zones of equal altitude are joined by closed interference fringes; these can be interpreted as isohypses. To quantify the angle of declivity within a period of the resulting dark-light pattern, it is necessary to know the mean wavelength. The difference of layer thickness between two interference lines of equal tone is about 226 nm for monochromatic light of \u03bb=546 nm. 2 The advantage of this technique is the simultaneous presentation of the profile of all the isohypses in just one picture (Fig. 1) .",
