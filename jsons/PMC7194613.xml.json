Some of the patients only showed mild fever, cough, or muscle soreness. The conditions of these patients deteriorated suddenly in the later stages of the disease or in the process of recovery. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure occurred rapidly, resulting in death within a short time.2 Cytokine storm is considered to be one of the major causes of ARDS and multiple-organ failure.3 It plays an important role in the process of disease aggravation.4 Clinical studies have detected a cytokine storm in critical patients with COVID-19. Therefore, effectively suppressing the cytokine storm is an important way to prevent the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 infection and save the patients' lives.5 This article reviews the mechanisms by which HCoV infection induces cytokine storm and the options to inhibit the cytokine storm, in order to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classifies the CoVs into four categories: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. Under the electron microscope, the virus particles display a rough spherical or multi-faceted crystal shape. The surface of the viruses has prominent club-shaped projections composed of its spike protein. Inside the virus particle is the viral genome wrapped in a nucleocapsid. The viral genome contains approximately 26,000 to 32,000 bases. CoVs are the largest known RNA viruses. The positive-strand viral RNA consists of a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end and multiple poly(A) tails at the 3\u2032 end. It serves as messenger RNA (mRNA), allowing the translation of replicase/transcriptase and viral structural proteins. The replicase/transcriptase genes account for approximately 2/3 of the 5\u2032-end RNA sequence and are composed of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b. The ORFs encode 16 non-structural proteins. The remaining 1/3 of the RNA sequence encodes four classical viral structural proteins, namely, spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. In addition, genes encoding some viral accessory proteins are interspersed in the coding regions of the viral structural proteins. The coding sites and number of these accessory protein genes are an important basis for CoV classification. CoVs can infect a variety of host species, including birds, humans and some other vertebrates. These viruses mainly cause respiratory and intestinal infections and induce a variety of clinical manifestations.6\n,\n7\n",

According to their pathogenicity, HCoVs are divided into mildly pathogenic HCoVs (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU) and highly pathogenic CoVs (including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV),9 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 10\n,\n11 and SARS-CoV-2). The mildly pathogenic HCoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause seasonal, mild to moderate cold-like respiratory diseases in healthy individuals. In contrast, the highly pathogenic HCoVs (hereinafter referred to as pathogenic HCoVs or HCoVs) infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia, sometimes leading to fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. The pathogenic HCoVs have high morbidity and mortality and pose a major threat to public health.12, 13, 14\n",

A rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection. However, dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immune damage to the human body.15, 16, 17 The relevant evidences from severely ill patients with HCoVs suggest that proinflammatory responses play a role in the pathogenesis of HCoVs. In vitro cell experiments show that delayed release of cytokines and chemokines occurs in respiratory epithelial cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages at the early stage of SARS-CoV infection. Later, the cells secrete low levels of the antiviral factors interferons (IFNs) and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) and chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5).18, 19, 20 Like SARS, MERS-CoV infects human airway epithelial cells, THP-1 cells (a monocyte cell line), human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs, and induces delayed but elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.21\n,\n22 After MERS-CoV infection, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but not mononuclear macrophages and DCs,23 are induced to produce a large amount of IFNs.",

            "text": "Animal models can well elucidate the role of cytokines and chemokines in mediating pulmonary immunopathology after HCoV infection. Despite of similar virus titers in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-infected old nonhuman primates are more likely to develop immune dysregulation than the infected young primates, leading to more severe disease manifestations.37 It seems that the excessive inflammatory response rather than the virus titer is more relevant to the death of the old nonhuman primates.37 Similarly, in BALB/c mice infected with SARS-CoV, disease severity in old mice is related to the early and disproportionately strong upregulation of the ARDS-related inflammatory gene signals.38 The rapid replication of SARS-CoV in BALB/c mice induces the delayed release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, which is accompanied by the influx of many pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages.15 The accumulated mononuclear macrophages receive activating signals through the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors on their surface and produce more monocyte chemoattractants (such as CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12), resulting in the further accumulation of mononuclear macrophages. These mononuclear macrophages produce elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL1-\u03b2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase), thereby increasing the severity of the disease. Depleting inflammatory monocyte-macrophages or neutralizing the inflammatory cytokine TNF protected mice from the fatal SARS-CoV infection. In addition, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or mononuclear macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines induce the apoptosis of T cells, which further hinders viral clearance.15 Another consequence of rapid viral replication and vigorous proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine response is the induction of apoptosis in lung epithelial and endothelial cells. IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induce inflammatory cell infiltration through mechanisms involving Fas\u2013Fas ligand (FasL) or TRAIL\u2013death receptor 5 (DR5) and cause the apoptosis of airway and alveolar epithelial cells.39, 40, 41 Apoptosis of endothelial cells and epithelial cells damages the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and causes vascular leakage and alveolar edema, eventually leading to hypoxia in the body. Therefore, inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS.",

During the 2003 SARS epidemic, corticosteroids were the primary means of immunomodulation. Timely administration of corticosteroids often leads to early improvements such as reducing fever, relieving radiation infiltration of the lung, and improving oxygenation.64, 65, 66 A retrospective study of 401 patients with severe SARS revealed that proper administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe SARS significantly reduced the mortality rate and shortened the hospital stay. Moreover, secondary infections and other complications rarely occurred in these glucocorticoid-treated patients.67 However, there are studies showing that administration of corticosteroid therapy during human SARS-CoV infection led to adverse consequences. Early treatment of SARS patients with corticosteroids increased plasma viral load in non-ICU patients, resulting in the aggravation of the disease.64\n",

MSC can inhibit the abnormal activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, and induce their differentiation into regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets and anti-inflammatory macrophages, respectively. It can also inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3, thereby reducing the occurrence of cytokine storms.87\n,\n88 At the same time, MSC can secrete IL-10, hepatocyte growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor and VEGF to alleviate ARDS, regenerate and repair damaged lung tissues, and resist fibrosis.89 Therefore, many functions of MSC are expected to make it an effective method for the treatment of COVID-19.",

The inflammatory response begins with an initial recognition of pathogens. The pathogens then mediate the recruitment of immune cells, which eliminates the pathogens and ultimately leads to tissue repair and restoration of homeostasis. However, SARS-CoV-2 induces excessive and prolonged cytokine/chemokine responses in some infected individuals, known as the cytokine storm. Cytokine storm causes ARDS or multiple-organ dysfunction, which leads to physiological deterioration and death. Timely control of the cytokine storm in its early stage through such means as immunomodulators and cytokine antagonists, as well as the reduction of lung inflammatory cell infiltration, is the key to improving the treatment success rate and reducing the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19.
