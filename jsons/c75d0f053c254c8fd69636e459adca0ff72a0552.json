Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) \u2265 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries.

The estimate_R function of the EpiEstim package assumes a Gamma distribution for SI by default to approximate the infectivity profile. 7 Technically, the transmission of an infectious disease is modeled with a Poisson process in the EpiEstim package. 7,8 When we choose a Gamma prior distribution for SI, the Bayesian statistical inference leads to a simple analytical expression for the Gamma posterior distribution of R0(t). 8 In the first scenario, we specified the mean (SD) of the Gamma distribution for SI to be 8.4 (3.8) days to mimic the 2003 epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. 8 Then, in the second scenario, we specified the mean (SD) of the Gamma distribution for SI to be 2.6 (1.5) days to mimic the 1918 pandemic of influenza in Baltimore, Maryland. 8 According to the current understanding, the transmissibility of .

The starting date of the COVID-19 epidemic differed among the 12 countries so that the sample size (i.e., number of days) varied from 58 (South Africa) to 109 (Japan). All the daily new confirmed cases in the 12 selected countries were laboratory confirmed, but the number of daily new confirmed cases included both domestic and repatriated cases according to the description of WHO. 4 As expected, the larger the mean value of daily new confirmed cases, the bigger the size of the corresponding SD. Spain, France, Belgium, and the United States of America had zero-valued Q1's, indicating that they had zero daily new confirmed case in the early phase of the pandemic for more than 25 days but the number of daily new confirmed cases were soaring quickly after then. These sample statistics revealed the magnitudes of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in each of the 12 selected countries over the study period.

Although this study could not provide the most accurate results rigorously, it sufficed for the pragmatic purpose from the public health viewpoint. We believed that it was an approximate answer to the right question timely. Refinements in the estimation of R0(t) can be made with the individual patient data, including personal contact history, whenever they are available for analysis.",

Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020, except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It seemed reasonable to take an average of these two as an approximate R0(t) for comparison. By doing so, the United States of America (A: 1.0197, B: 0.9974) and South Africa (A: 1.4655, B: 1.1080) were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) \u2265 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries.

            "text": "Singapore. Many recoveries are probably not susceptible any more in the late phase of the epidemic. Although there was officially no imported case of COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, the imported cases of COVID-19 are the major sources of initial infection in many other countries starting from February of 2020. These features made the task of modeling this epidemic in any country outside China more difficult. Moreover, since the COVID-19 is new to human society, its diagnostic criteria, control measures, and medical care are inevitably changing during the pandemic as the knowledge and experience about it are accumulated continuously. 4,5 Thus, the result obtained in this study is merely a rough estimate of R0(t) for each of the 12 selected countries. Nevertheless, our findings for the 12 selected countries passing the early phase of the pandemic are consistent with the early estimates of R0 for the COVID-19 epidemic such as 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.96\u22122.55)\u22123.58 (95% CI: 2.89\u22124.39), had several limitations because we relied on some assumptions to make a rapid analysis of this ongoing epidemic feasible. First, we assumed that all new cases of COVID-19 in each of the 12 selected countries are detected and reported to the WHO correctly. However, asymptomatic or mild cases of COVID-19 are likely undetected, and thus under-reported, especially in the early phase of the epidemic. 5,14 .",

            "text": "countries, a lack of diagnostic test kits for the SARS-CoV-2 and a shortage of qualified manpower for fast testing can also cause under-reporting or delay in reporting. Nevertheless, we only analyze the official source of epidemic data for examining the trend of R0(t) during an epidemic because it is feasible, transparent, and reproducible. Unintentional under-reporting is inevitable in any country during an ongoing epidemic due to various reasons. Second, since the reported number of daily new confirmed cases includes both domestic and repatriated cases according to the description of WHO, 4 the imported cases lead to an over-estimation of R0(t) in our epidemic analysis. Yet, they most likely appear in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then have less effect on the estimated R0(t) in the later phase of the pandemic. The estimate_R function of the EpiEstim package provides the option for including the separated data of imported cases in the estimation of R0(t). 7 Thus, our epidemic analysis can be easily refined once the domestic and repatriated cases are reported separately in the future. Third, we admitted the time delay in our estimates of R0(t) for the COVID-19 pandemic in the 12 selected countries due to the following two time lags: (1) the duration between the time of infection and the time of symptom onset (i.e., the incubation period of infection) if infectiousness began around the time of symptom onset 8 and (2) the duration between the time of symptom onset and the time of diagnosis. 5 Nevertheless, since asymptomatic carriers can transmit the COVID-19, 15-17 the first time lag is actually shorter than expected and it becomes the duration between the time of infection and the time of becoming infectious (i.e., the latent period of infection). Moreover, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis is shorter and shorter due to the full alert of society and the faster diagnostic tests. 5 Fourth, we assumed that the distribution of SI does not change considerably over time as the pandemic progresses.

            "text": ", we could see that the size of the epidemic varies across these 12 countries. It primarily depends on how early and how fast the effective control measures are taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus from the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any mistakes in this matter would have a dramatic impact on the sequel. The commonly used lag-1 relative change (%) in the number of daily new confirmed cases is not useful because its denominator varies and the time lag is not long enough to reflect what is really going on behind those numbers. Next, as shown in Figures 1-2A and 1-2B, 2-2A and 2-2B, \u2026, and 12-2A and 12-2B respectively, the estimated R0(t) over sliding weekly windows for each of the 12 selected countries begins to drop gradually after a certain time period. Yet, when the number of new confirmed cases is climbing up day by day before it reaches the peak(s), everyone is keen to know: When will the epidemic curve reach the hilltop? 19",

Notice that the same value of R0(t) may have quite different magnitudes of impacts on the number of daily new confirmed cases, depending on infectious cases in the community at the time. Even though R0(t) = 1.0, the number of daily new confirmed cases can still go up soon if more and more infectious subjects are accumulated in society. Thus, a steeply sloped line of the estimated R0(t)is crucial -that is, how early and how fast does it go downhill? Finally, the COVID-19 epidemic in China ended around March 7\u22128, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China were very effective, 20-23 but when can it happen in the 12 selected countries? In particular, the resurgence has occurred in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa respectively. Thus, when the COVID-19 pandemic will end in any of the 12 selected countries and the whole world worries us.Given a symmetric one-peak epidemic curve, the total time and size of the epidemic is just the double of the time and size from the beginning of the epidemic to its peak. As compared to China's experience of success, each of the 12 selected countries should quickly learn from the fresh lessons of the past two to three months, and then find much more effective ways to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic for winning the battle against the coronavirus (see Appendix). In our opinion, seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease.And, the consistent decline of the estimated R0(t) in trend over time is more important than the actual values of the estimated R0(t) themselves. The steeper the slope, the sooner the epidemic ends.Finally, we urged public health authorities and scientists worldwide to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers routinely during epidemics of infectious diseases and to report them daily on their websites such as the \"Tracking the Epidemic\" of China CDC for guiding the control strategies and reducing the unnecessary panic of the public until the end of the epidemic.23  Fitting complex transmission models of",
