According to Holland\u2019s theory [5], each occupation (or applicant) can be assigned 1 to 3 out of 6 personality types characterizing different personality types. These personality types are assigned RIASEC labels: Realistic (R), Investigative (I), Artistic (A), Social (S), Enterprising (E) and Conventional (C) (see Fig. 1a). Ideally, one should match people with jobs based on personality types, assuming that all other job criteria (e.g., skills, abilities, knowledge, etc.) are already met. For example, doctor, researcher, and lawyer are jobs ideal for people with investigative personality type, while photographer, musician, and architect are jobs ideal for people with artistic personality type.",

To address these challenges, we propose JPLink, a framework to profile jobs with their personality types, which: (1) jointly learns domain-specific word and occupation representations using knowledge available in O*NET. To the best of knowledge, this is the first work to learn word representations specific to occupations and jobs; (2) incorporates a novel supervised approach to assign RIASEC labels to occupations and job posts using their text context, which considers the inter-correlations among RIASEC dimensions. JPLink outperforms the conventional baselines by 4.86% and it yields a high ranking accuracy measured by NDCG (=0.949); and (3) predicts the personality type labels for a set of job posts, extracted from Singapore\u2019s JobsBank1, for which weak labels are assigned using a distant supervision approach. Our error analysis shows JPLink can effectively overcome the imperfections caused by the limitation of assuming all jobs of the same occupation share the identical personality type.",

To the best of our knowledge, there are three types of methods for occupational level personality type determination: (a) Incumbent Method, in which the personality type of an occupation is the average of the personality types of a representative sample of workers taking jobs of that occupation (based on the Holland\u2019s idea that people sharing the same occupation represent the occupation). This method requires the personality types of many individuals and is therefore very costly (i.e., less practical); (b) Empirical Method, which uses occupational analysis data (collected using Incumbent Method) to develop classifiers to predict the personality type of occupations; and (c) Judgment Method, which involves trained experts making direct personality type assignment to occupations. An example for such an approach is O*NET interest profiler [12]. It constructs initial personality type of occupations based on discriminant functions derived from the ratings of Occupational Units [12]. Judgment method is then performed to fine-tune the constructed personality profiles using expert knowledge. Usually, human judges are trained to determine occupations\u2019 personality profiles after looking at attributes of occupations such as title, description, and job tasks. Hence, such an approach requires a considerable human effort. It is also difficult to extend this kind of approach for new emerging occupations and jobs. Almost all these previous efforts share the assumption of all job posts of the same occupation share the same personality type. This differentiates our research from them.\n",

Each occupation has a profile consisting of six numerical scores in the range [0, 100], one for each RIASEC dimension. The dimensions with scores more than 50 are known as the interest codes of the occupation. For example, an occupation with profile of (R = 80, I = 40, A = 20, S = 60, E = 10, C = 70) will be assigned the Holland codes R, C and S. The rightmost column in Table 1 shows the RIASEC distribution for the 1110 occupations found in O*NET. Table 1 depicts the Spearman\u2019s correlation between personality type dimensions. We observe that the correlations among dimension is consistent with Holland\u2019s Hexagonal Model (Fig. 1a). The opposite and consecutive dimensions in Holland\u2019s Hexagon have significant negative correlations (e.g., Realistic vs Social, Enterprising vs Investigative, and Artistic vs Conventional) and positive correlations (e.g., Artistic vs Social) respectively. In other words, jobs for realistic people may not suit social people, jobs for enterprising people may not suit investigative people, etc. On the other hand, artistic people may be able to take on social jobs.",

While each job post has an SSOC code corresponding to some occupation, the code is not associated with RIASEC profiles. To derive the latter, we propose a distant supervised approach to map SSOC occupations to most similar O*NET occupations (for which personality types are assigned). Since there is no direct mapping between SSOC and SOC, we first use a mapping table3 matching SSOC occupation codes with ESCO occupation codes which are the occupation codes standardized in the EU region. Subsequently, we determine the most similar SOC occupations for each ESCO occupation using another mapping table from Bureau of Labor Statistics of USA4. Finally, the RIASEC profile of an SSOC occupation is defined as the average of its similar SOC occupations\u2019 profiles. Following the assumption that jobs have RIASEC profiles similar to their occupations, we assign weak interest profile labels to the job posts. In this way, we are able to map 96.71% of SSOC occupations to 96.57% of ESCO occupations, and finally 75.23% of SOC occupations. This amounts to 171,946 job posts assigned with weak interest profile labels, which are used in Sect. 6 to train JPLink and to evaluate the prediction accuracy.",

Generally, the skip-gram model is trained on a large general text corpora (i.e., Wikipedia and Google News) which do not carry any occupation-specific knowledge. The trivial way of constructing representations for multi-word entities is taking the mean representation of the words in the particular entity (e.g., the representation of \u201ccomputer programmer\u201d is the mean of the representations of \u201ccomputer\u201d and \u201cprogrammer\u201d).

This motivates us to propose an approach to predict the personality type profiles by learning to rank [1, 2]. We introduce a listwise loss function for learning, which consider the relative ranking information of all RIASEC dimensions together. We adopt ListNet [2], a listwise learning to rank method, to compute the target top one probability of dimension d for a given occupation o as,1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} P_{d}(y_o) = \\frac{\\exp {y_o^{d}}}{\\sum _{d^{'} \\in \\{R, I, A, S, E, C\\}}\\exp {y_o^{d^{'}}}} \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{y}_{o}$$\\end{document} is used as the corresponding modeled top one probability.

To illustrate this fact further, we further analyze the learned parameters of the JPLink-Pred model. As depicted in Table 3, in JPLink-Pred, each row in the A projection matrix corresponds to the linear mapping learned for a RIASEC dimension. As shown in Table 3, the correlations among the rows of A reflect the actual correlations between the corresponding RIASEC dimensions. These correlations are consistent with those seen in Table 1. Moreover, we also found the bias values (b) of our model are consistent with the actual distribution of RIASEC dimensions in O*NET.

Table 4 lists a few cases where JPLink wrongly predicts labels. In these example cases, job titles and descriptions do not tally with the corresponding occupations (assigned by the current system). For instance, the job title lead full stack developer is assigned to the occupation category, \u201cGraphics and Multimedia Designers and Artists\u201d, instead of an occupation related to software development (e.g., Software Developer).
