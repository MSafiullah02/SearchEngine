            "text": "During the last few decades, emerging infectious diseases have become an increasingly important global public health problem and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Emerging infectious diseases are characterized by a rapid increase in incidence or geographical range [17]. Examples of such outbreaks are the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated from Asia in 2003, the Avian influenza H5N1, and the H1N1 2009 pandemic [17]. Effective surveillance systems for early warning of the outbreak are crucial. Traditional surveillance systems involve laboratory identification of the pathogen responsible for the disease. Such surveillance systems are passive in their nature, since they require a bottom-up process of identifying a possible infectious disease by clinicians, reporting to the appropriate authorities, confirming the disease by laboratory tests, and disseminating the information by the authorities.",

Due to this limitation, new surveillance systems were developed. An impetus to developing these new surveillance systems was the adoption of the revised World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005, which required national capability for surveillance and reporting of both familiar and previously unfamiliar infectious diseases [25]. As a result, digital surveillance, or, digital systems for the detection of infection disease epidemics have been evolving dramatically. Morse has defined \u201cdigital disease detection\u201d as \u201cthe use of the internet and computer technologies for collecting and processing health information, including outbreak reports and surveillance data\u201d [17].",

These systems are based on syndromes rather than laboratory identification, without laboratory confirmation [17]. Formal digital systems are based on data arriving from formal organizations such as hospitals, healthcare clinics, and health agencies, whereas informal digital systems are based on data collected through media sources such as news reports on the Internet, mailing lists, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, as well as data collected through official sources. Informal digital systems are characterized by their ability of mining, categorizing, filtering, and visualizing online information regarding epidemics [4]. They exploit the ease of using online information, as well as the freely available mapping technology to produce globally available information on ongoing infectious diseases, which may not be captured through traditional surveillance, and may be useful to governments and health agencies [4]. These systems are designed to function during all phases of disease outbreak, and are planned to increase sensitivity and timeliness. However, the role of such systems before, during and after infectious disease epidemics and, in particular, whether such systems are currently capable of early detection of epidemics remains unclear.",

Filtered information (about 90 articles per day) is published in three languages (English, Japanese and Vietnamese). Articles are processed and disseminated every hour. In addition, BioCaster creates an ontology which covers approximately 117 infectious diseases and six syndromes. The ontology is produced in eight languages (English, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Korean, Spanish and French), and is used as an input to Global Health Monitor web portal, which offers its users maps and graphs of health-concerning events [12].",

Studies performed by Google and Yahoo have shown that plotting data on searches using influenza-related keywords has led to an epidemic curve that closely matched the epidemic curve generated by traditional surveillance of influenza [4]. Google Flu Trends analyzes a fraction of the total Google searches over a period of time, and extrapolates the data to estimate the search volume. The information is displayed in a graph called \u201csearch volume index graph\u201d.

            "text": "A mandatory requisite for the use of digital systems data for epidemiological investigation of an outbreak is the reliability of the data, as well as their equivalence to official data. In other words, there should be a match between the number of cases derived from the informal data and the number of cases officially reported by public health authorities. Indeed, our results have pointed out an example in which a correlation between digital systems data and official data in the first stages of epidemic was confirmed in the data collected from Healthmap regarding the 2010 Haitian Cholera. However, as mentioned by the authors, epidemiological measurements using digital systems data should be also tested in other epidemics, in order to confirm the method\u2019s reliability [9]. The fact that the number of subscribers to digital systems is increasing each year [15] makes these systems an efficient tool for globally spreading the information, as well as a tool for epidemiological investigation, complementary to official data. However, despite their theoretical advantage over traditional surveillance, there is no evidence in the literature that information collected through digital system had affected public health policy makers.",

Our results are consistent with some other studies conclusions, pointing out that currently digital systems are not capable of detecting an outbreak [17, 4]. Although there is evidence of informal digital systems publishing reports on outbreaks before official detection (such as in the Polio outbreak of 2013 and 2014 pointed out in the results section) [1], these reports did not actually affect the process of detection. The formal process of detection includes receiving the information, processing the information and using the information. The early digital systems reports were not used in any of the detection phases and did not change the process. It may be viewed as an analogue to screening tests which are effective only if they are capable of changing the natural history of a disease. Since there is no evidence of informal digital systems capable of changing the \u201cnatural history of outbreak\u201d so far, they cannot be considered useful for early detection.",

First, most systems accumulate a huge mass of information on a large variety of diseases, making it difficult to extract critical information. In other words, no integration of the information is performed to yield useful information. The challenge is to present critical information clearly and concisely. Second, digital systems are less specific than traditional surveillance systems, mostly due to false alarms, misinformation and information based on rumors [9, 17]. Therefore, they may not be solely used but as a complementary tool for traditional surveillance systems [17]. A third limitation is the lack of a response system to early warnings. With the lack of such a system, early warning is not useful, as no practical action is followed by the publication of the information. Such a response system may include triggers and decision criteria, which would lead to an appropriate and proportionate response to the threat [17].",

As a result, a new generation of informal digital systems has emerged. The most prominent advantage of such systems is their ability to report on an outbreak in near real-time, or, in other words, before the information is officially reported, and by this to be used by public health decision makers for epidemiological assessment and preparation for the pandemic. Currently there is no evidence in the literature for their capability to detect an outbreak at its onset. In addition, there are no hard data to prove the benefits of using such systems before and during an outbreak. We do not believe that they can be used to identify early cases, but should be used as a support system for describing the spread of the disease. The challenge is to empirically assess the efficiency of informal digital systems and their use for decision making and interventions during crisis, as well as to test the systems\u2019 sensitivity and specificity. A more general informal system, which provides syndromic-based analysis of reports disseminated by all currently existing systems, may be the next step toward disease outbreak detection based on informal systems.",
