The major stock markets have witnessed a decline in double figures with S&P 500 taking 16 trading days to post a 30% decline.",

By dividing our sample into two parameters, firstly, Epidemic (Dec 2019 to March 10, 2020) and Pandemic (-post-March 10, 20202\n) and secondly, on the global spread, Phase 1, where coronavirus deaths were limited to China; Phase 2, European Spread and Phase 3, North American Spread, we have interesting findings. We find that Chinese markets displayed relative calm with lower volatility during both epidemic and pandemic period which negates the recent work of Zhenghui and Junhao (2019), who argue that Chinese markets are more susceptible to uncertainty shocks emanating from China. On the other hand, the average volatility of stock markets in the US, UK, Germany and South Korea increased as Coronavirus moved from epidemic to pandemic stage. Secondly, the European indices showed the highest volatility in the US phase even though the European phase (Phase II) has recorded a higher fatality rate. These findings conform to studies of Antonakakis et al. (2013), Chen and Chiang (2020) and Tiwari et al. (2019), who have studied the impact of economic uncertainty on financial market volatility.",

The EGARCH model presides over other models with its ability to allow for a more stable optimization of routines, and no parameter constraints.

The \u03b1 consideration represents the symmetric effect of the model, i.e. the GARCH effect. \u03b2 calculates the perseverance in conditional volatility irrespective of market movements.

Among the non-debt securities, Gold showed relative stability. Crude Oil has the highest volatility during this period, but that cannot be attributed wholly to the pandemic, but also due to the regional disputes among oil-producing nations. The higher volatility of oil prices runs contrary to Gkillas et al. (2020), who argued for financial stress improving oil price forecasts.

The equity market declines amplified in pandemic stage, evident from higher negative returns. European markets registered higher negative returns as compared to other markets. This may be attributed to higher media coverage in the pandemic period leading to negative sentiments which caused markets to decline and volatility to rise (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011, Peress, 2014, Donadelli, 2015). Another possible reason for this sudden fall could be that most of the European countries announced lockdown around the start of the pandemic phase4\nresulting in a shut down of almost all the economic activities which is bound to affect the markets. Another important point to note is that the Chinese market showed a lower decline in retains and remained stable. This could be attributed to the hopes supported by the government\u2019s claims that the Coronavirus outbreak is under control in China itself, and the anticipation of further easing measures in fiscal policy to support the economy. Following equity markets, debt-based securities in our sample showed higher levels of volatility in the pandemic period as compared to the epidemic period. As far as commodities are concerned, Bitcoin started to show its inherent weakness during a tough financial condition during the pandemic period and registered the biggest average negative return of \u22123.66% in the pandemic period. Gold which remained reasonably less volatile in epidemic period started showing a decline in returns during pandemic period but in terms of volatility, it is found to be the least volatile supporting the notion of \u201cGold a safe-haven asset\u201d (Reboredo, 2013).",

For a better understanding of the split in phases, the global financial markets volatility increased once the casualty numbers started rising outside China. Phase 3, which recorded casualties in the US, further enhanced the financial market volatilities impacting commodities like gold which were relatively shielded in earlier findings and overall had least negative returns. Chinese market\u2019s volatility levels did not vary drastically in the three phases suggesting a lower global integration and early actions taken by the authorities to contain the Coronavirus spread. Interestingly European markets\u2019 volatility enhanced in Phase 3, rather than Phase 2, which is the European spread. As discussed earlier, this may be attributed to the delayed reaction from the European premiers as compared to their Asian counterparts,5\nwhere they imposed lockdown during phase 3 instead of phase 2, which is considered as one of the main reasons for Coronavirus spread in the continent (Sohrabi et al., 2020). In terms of the regional indices (Fig. 1), Asia recorded the lowest volatility while the EU regional index showed the highest volatility during the US phase. For Bitcoin, the larger negative returns in Phase 2 and 3, suggest a contagion effect with equity markets during financial turmoil. Similar to our earlier discussion, Chinese stock markets and Gold remained less volatile in the US phase.",

Within 100 days, nearly 30% of wealth has eroded off the bourses globally. Our findings suggest towards a more increasingly panic and quickly deteriorating situation in the markets as Coronavirus moved from epidemic to pandemic. The situation has worsened as the global spread has gone beyond geographical and continental boundaries, with even safer commodities like gold returns turning negative as COVID-19 spreads to the US but still found to be least volatile. Chinese stock markets recovered in the US phase owing to the timely actions taken by the authorities.",
