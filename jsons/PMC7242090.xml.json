Prior studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-6 and other cytokines activate coagulation.7,8 COVID-19 is associated with a profound inflammatory response in many patients that is characterized by high IL-6, fibrinogen, and ferritin concentrations.1 COVID-19 is also associated with high D-dimer, suggesting extensive thrombin generation and fibrinolysis.1 This pattern may reflect hypercoagulability related to severe inflammation.9 Our case series demonstrates that some critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the United States have a coagulation profile characterized by severely elevated fibrinogen concentration and FVIII activity, as well as low normal antithrombin and functional protein C activity. This hypercoagulable pattern appears to be accentuated with age, particularly in men. These findings have similarities with and differences from a recent study by Panigada et al9 where functional protein C activity was normal in most patients and mean FVIII activity was elevated to 297%. Mean fibrinogen concentration in their study was 680 mg/dL compared to 763 mg/dL in our study. The authors did not explore the impact of age on coagulation profile and there were few details provided about the patients\u2019 comorbidities. We postulate that differences between the 2 studies could be related to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and other comorbidities among adults in the United States leading to more severe coagulation abnormalities.",

Given this imbalance, there may be a role for systemic anticoagulation or low-dose thrombolysis in some patients. Although not commercially available in the United States, recombinant thrombomodulin could be a potential treatment for hypercoagulable patients with COVID-19. It has immunomodulatory effects and increases protein C activation in the presence of thrombin.15 There are no high-quality studies to support systemic anticoagulation at this time, but the observational study by Tang et al6 strongly suggests that patients with an elevated D-dimer concentration have better survival when treated with anticoagulation.",
