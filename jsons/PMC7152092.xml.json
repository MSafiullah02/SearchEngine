            "text": "An estimated 40 million illnesses each year are caused by foodborne pathogens, including 5.2 million (13%) due to bacteria, 2.5 million (7%) due to parasites and 30.9 million (80%) due to viruses (Mead et al., 1999). In the last decade, the occurrence of gastroenteritis in humans as a result of consumption of foods contaminated by viruses has increased (WHO, 2000). The transmission of viruses has been predominantly associated with the consumption of shellfish, mainly, raw oysters (Koopmans and Duizer, 2004, Widdowson et al., 2005), which have been contaminated by polluted water or virus-infected food handlers (Bosch et al., 2011). Common symptoms of viral gastroenteritis include vomiting and diarrhea (FAO/WHO, 2008). Foodborne viruses can be divided into three categories based on disease symptoms: those that cause gastroenteritis (noroviruses, rotaviruses and adenoviruses), those that cause fecal-orally transmitted hepatitis (hepatitis A and E viruses), and those that cause other illnesses after they migrate to other organs, such as the central nervous system or the liver (enteroviruses). Of these, noroviruses and the hepatitis A virus have been recognized as the most important human foodborne pathogens in terms of the number of outbreaks reported and the number of people affected in the world (Koopmans and Duizer, 2004, Cook and Rzezutka, 2006, Verhoef et al., 2008). Even though these viruses are the major cause of foodborne outbreaks, there is still an urgent need for standardization and the validation of detection methods at the national and international levels (FAO/WHO, 2008). In this chapter, an overview of existing detection methods for foodborne viruses are presented including non-molecular and molecular approaches as well as promising emerging methods for virus detection. The detection of noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, rotaviruses and adenoviruses will be discussed as these viral agents have a high potential for foodborne outbreaks. The rest of this section briefly gives the essential characteristic features of these viruses.",

The primary source of infection is the consumption of fecally contaminated drinking water in developing countries (Koopmans et al., 2002). Based on geographical origin, all isolated HEV strains can be identified into four genotypes as Asian/African, Chinese, Mexican or US/European (Emerson and Purcell, 2001).

Even though these assays are commonly used to enumerate levels of viable polioviruses and adenoviruses, they are inadequate for the detection of the two most important foodborne viruses, HAVs and NVs, since neither of these replicate or express themselves efficiently in cell cultures (Goyal, 2006, Jiang et al., 2004, Koopmans and Duizer, 2004).

Although immunoassays, such as ELISA, have been used to detect viruses in water and HAVs in shellfish, reports are very limited and not always successful (Lees, 2000). The limited success of this approach is probably due to the lack of sensitivity of the immunoassay and like EM requires a thousand or more virus particles for a positive result (Kogawa et al., 1996). Therefore, new approaches have focused on molecular methods as these techniques for detecting enteric viruses are faster and more sensitive compared to infectivity tests performed with in vitro cell cultures or with immunological methods, even though molecular methods cannot discriminate between infectious and non-infectious particles (Green and Lewis, 1999, Morales-Rayas et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR assays depends mainly on primer selection (Atmar and Estes, 2001). The major obstacle in NV detection with PCR arises from the very high genomic diversity of NV since new variants continue to evolve constantly (Widen et al., 2011). Therefore, it is difficult to select a single or even a small number of probes that can detect all possible NV variants (Atmar and Estes, 2001). Although ORF1 of the RdRp gene has been targeted in most of the assays (Nakayama et al., 1996, Jiang et al., 1999), the ORF1-ORF2 region has also been shown to be well conserved and is used in several assays (Katayama et al., 2002, Hohne and Schreier, 2004, Jothikumar et al., 2005b). One of the first enteric viruses detected by RT-PCR was HAV (Jansen et al., 1990). The VP1 capsid region was previously commonly targeted by primers in HAV detection; however, nowadays the 5\u2019 non-coding region is highly preferred for targeting. It has similar performance as VP1, approximately 1 RNA copy per reaction (Sanchez et al., 2007). For HEV detection, various specific sets of primers have been developed to amplify conserved regions within ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (Enouf et al., 2006). Most of the RT-PCR assays developed for rotaviruses target the structural genes VP4, VP6 and VP7 (Atmar, 2006). The hexon gene in adenoviruses is most commonly used as the target in PCR assays; it has been shown to be reactive in all adenovirus species (Jothikumar et al., 2005a, Atmar, 2006). More recently, a FRET-based real-time assay, which amplifies the adenovirus fiber gene, was described. It showed slightly better performance in terms of detection limits of AdV40 and AdV41 compared to TaqMan assays (Jothikumar et al., 2005a).",

Integrated cell culture PCR (ICC-PCR) and ICC/strand-specific RT-PCR have been proposed to compensate for this problem (Atmar, 2006, Jiang et al., 2004). ICC/strand-specific RT-PCR is a combination of cell culture and molecular biology-based methods, which requires initial propagation of infectious virus particles in a cell culture and the detection of a negative-strand RNA replicative intermediate as an indicator of viral replication (Jiang et al., 2004). The limitations of RT-PCR were eliminated in environmental samples by increasing the equivalent sample volume and thereby reducing the effects of inhibitory compounds (Reynolds et al., 1996). ICC-PCR and ICC/strand-specific RT-PCR assays targeting the VP3 genes, which code for a major HAV capsid protein, have been developed to detect viruses in water (Jiang et al., 2004). The ICC/strand-specific RT-PCR used in this study was demonstrated to be a novel, rapid, sensitive and reliable method, since it can detect infectious HAVs at inoculation level of 100 TCID50 per flask within four days in water samples.",

Detection limits lower than 1 infectious unit (poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and HAV) or RT-PCR-amplifiable unit (NV) for all viruses were obtained by the multiplex method. In a similar vein, mRT-PCR has been developed to concentrate and purify HAV, PV1 and simian rotaviruses (RV-SA11) simultaneously from experimentally seeded oysters (Coelho et al., 2003). However, this method could not detect the three viruses simultaneously when tested on experimentally contaminated raw oysters.

In recent years, qRT-PCR has been widely used in food virology as the most promising nucleic acid detection method, since it offers several advantages over conventional RT-PCR, including high sensitivity, the possibility of simultaneous amplification, detection and quantification of the target nucleic acids in a single step, and with minimum risk of carry-over contamination through the use of a closed system (Mackay et al., 2002, Bosch et al., 2011, Houde et al., 2007). Sensitive and specific detection with real-time PCR is achieved using novel fluorescent technology probes (Espy et al., 2006). In qPCR assays, three types of fluorescently labeled target-specific probes have been used most often: TaqMan probes, molecular beacons and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes (Sanchez et al., 2007). These detection methods all depend on the transfer of light energy between two adjacent dye molecules, a process known as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Espy et al., 2006).",

These assays combine a specific linear dual-labeled oligoprobe in the TaqMan master mix to eliminate the need for post amplification steps and also offer the opportunity of multiplexing amplification reactions (Houde et al., 2007). Several studies targeting the 5\u2019 non-coding region (NCR) have been performed with TaqMan qRT-PCR to detect HAVs (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2002, El Galil et al., 2005, Jothikumar et al., 2005b, Costafreda et al., 2006). The detection limits ranged from one to five copies per reaction. In NV detection, real-time TaqMan-PCR targeting in the well conserved ORF1-ORF2 region has been developed (Hohne and Schreier, 2004, Jothikumar et al., 2005b). These TaqMan RT-PCR assays were able to detect as few as 100 genomic equivalents of different NV strains, including subtypes of GI and GII, rapidly, sensitively and reliably. A TaqMan RT-PCR assay targeting a conserved region in ORF3 has also been developed to detect HEVs in clinical and environmental samples (Jothikumar et al., 2006). This assay was shown to be sensitive and specific for detecting HEV genotypes 1\u20134 with the detection limit as few as four genome equivalent copies of HEV plasmid DNA and as low as 0.12 50% pig infectious dose (PID50) of swine HEV. Moreover, the detection of different concentrations of swine HEVs (120\u20131.2 PID50) in a surface water concentrate was performed successfully.",

A qRT-PCR based on the amplification of 5\u02b9-NCR was used to detect genome copies of HAVs using TaqMan and MB probes in clinical and shellfish samples (Costafreda et al., 2006).

These probes are also referred to as LightCycler probes and are commercially available (Espy et al., 2006, Sanchez et al., 2006). A commercial qRT-PCR assay, the LightCycler HAV quantification kit (Roche Diagnostics), coupled with immunomagnetic separation (IMS) pretreatment, has been shown to be sensitive and specific in the detection of HAVs in fresh produce (Shan et al., 2005). IMS is based on the isolation of an antigen from the sample with a monoclonal antibody against HAV (anti-HAV 1009) combined with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to recover low levels of viruses and to remove PCR inhibitors. In this assay, 5\u02b9 NCR was chosen as the highly conserved target region and a detection limit as low as 1 PFU was obtained. In a similar study, two commercial qRT-PCR HAV assays, the LightCycler HAV quantification kit (Roche Diagnostics) and the RealArt HAV LC RT PCR kit (artus GmbH), were compared in terms of precision, accuracy, linearity and detection limits (Sanchez et al., 2006). The results showed that both kits were suitable for detecting and quantifying HAVs; however, the Roche kit had a slightly better detection limit with the capability of differentiating between different HAV strains and it was also able to detect HAVs in spiked water and food samples.",

In this method, an RNA template is amplified under isothermal conditions using three enzymes (avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H and T7 RNA polymerase) in the reaction tube (Compton, 1991). NASBA is particularly suitable for detecting RNA viruses since the direct amplification of RNA targets is possible without a separate reverse transcription step (Jean et al., 2001, Jean et al., 2004). It has also been shown to be less susceptible to environmental PCR inhibitors (Rutjes et al., 2006). Even though the amplification power and the sensitivity of NASBA assays are comparable or even better than that of RT-PCR (Jean et al., 2001), NASBA assays have been used in relatively few studies for detecting enteric viruses compared to RT-PCR.",

Amplification of viral RNA from HAVs and human rotaviruses with selected primers in the multiplex NASBA mixture had detection limits of 40 and 400 PFU/ml for rotaviruses and HAVs, respectively (Jean et al., 2002b). In this study, highly conserved regions in rotavirus gene 9 and in the HAV VP2 gene encoding a major capsid protein were targeted for amplification. Accordingly, multiplex NASBA has been used to detect HAVs, GI and GII noroviruses from representative ready-to-eat foods (Jean et al., 2004). All three viruses were detected in the food matrix simultaneously through targeting relatively conserved genomic regions for each of these, with detection limits ranging from 2 \u00d7 102 to 2 \u00d7 103 PFU/9 cm2. These results show that NASBA is a promising alternative to RT-PCR as it offers rapid and simultaneous detection in a single reaction tube.",

The measurable fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of the target sequence (Leone et al., 1998). More recently, real-time NASBA using a MB probe has been demonstrated to be a sensitive and specific assay for NV detection in clinical and environmental samples (Lamhoujeb et al., 2009). Molecular methods, despite being sensitive and specific, cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viruses. Hence, an enzymatic treatment followed by molecular beacon NASBA targeting of the highly conserved ORF1-ORF2 junction has been developed to distinguish infectious from non-infectious NVs in ready-to-eat food (Lamhoujeb et al., 2008). The proposed enzymatic pretreatment utilized proteinase K and RNase at the same time to digest non-infectious virus particles (Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002).",

With the help of metallic nanostructures, SERS amplifies low-level Raman signals within highly localized optical fields on metallic surfaces. It overcomes the limitations of conventional Raman spectroscopy because of the electromagnetic field or chemical enhancement (Kneipp et al., 2002). SERS spectral fingerprints have been used to discriminate between different types of viruses (Fan et al., 2010, Shanmukh et al., 2006). Recently, several food and waterborne viruses, namely noroviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and herpesviruses, were detected and identified using a gold substrate (Fan et al., 2010). Viruses with or without an envelope were differentiated using multivariate statistical analyses (SIMCA) with more than 95% classification accuracy. For SERS, the detection limit was a titer of 102, demonstrating promise for the rapid detection and identification of viruses in food and water samples.",

EIS has been used to detect several viruses including the influenza virus, the rabies virus, the hepatitis B virus and HIV (Kukol et al., 2008, Hassen et al., 2008, Hassen et al., 2011, Hnaien et al., 2008). Many types of biosensor are based on EIS (Hassen et al., 2008). Recently, the influenza A virus was detected using EIS with an antibody-neutravidin-thiol structure immobilized on the surface of an Au electrode in solutions of phosphate buffer saline with large amounts of non-target protein, which showed the detection sensitivity and selectivity (Hassen et al., 2011). The detection limit was as low as 8 ng/ml, which shows the efficiency of this approach for virus detection. A biosensor based on EIS has been used to detect the label-free viral DNA hybridization of avian influenza virus (Kukol et al., 2008). Even though EIS has not been used for foodborne virus detection, it is a promising approach in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and response.",

            "text": "Immunoassays are analytical methods that produce a sensitive, selective and measurable response based on highly specific antibody and antigen interactions (\nLi et al., 2011a, Lee et al., 2011). Until recently, ELISA and enzyme immunoassays were widely used in foodborne virus detection. Even though these methods are reliable, they are time-consuming and labor intensive. An immunoassay using microsphere technology can overcome the limitations associated with traditional ELISA (Go et al., 2008). The well-known microsphere assay system, the xMap system (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX), combines three well-established technologies: bioassays, solution phase microspheres and flow cytometry (Go et al., 2008). A liquid suspension array consisting of unique color-coded microsphere polystyrene beads is coupled to antigens and antibody reactions, and the emissions are then measured by a flow-based detector (Deregt et al., 2006). Microsphere immunoassays offer several advantages, including accuracy, high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, high-throughput sample analysis and multiplexing capability, over traditional ELISAs (Go et al., 2008). In particular, the multiplexing capability enables the detection of a multiplex analyte in a single reaction tube based on individually identifiable, fluorescently coded sets of polystyrene microbeads (Binnicker et al., 2011, Khan et al., 2006). In the last decade, a number of microsphere-based immunoassays have been described for the antigen and antibody detection of several viruses including HIV (Bellisario et al., 2001), non-human primate viruses (Khan et al., 2006), avian influenza virus (Deregt et al., 2006), West Nile virus (Johnson et al., 2007), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Binnicker et al., 2008) and hepatitis C virus (Fonseca et al., 2011).",

More recently, a MEMS biosensor has been developed to detect hepatitis A and hepatitis C viruses (HCVs) in serum using dynamic-mode microcantilevers without any labels or preamplification (Timurdogan et al., 2011). Electroplated nickel MEMS cantilevers functionalized with HAV or HCV antibodies were exposed to either HAV antigens (Case 1 and Case 3) or HCV antigens (Case 2 and Case 4), in increasing concentrations in an undiluted serum (Fig. 11.2\n). The minimum detection limit concentration was 0.1 ng/ml for both HAVs and HCVs, which is comparable with labeled sensing detection methods such as ELISA. Moreover, it was shown that the dynamic range of this biosensor was in excess of 1000:1 for the specific type of hepatitis antibody used.",

This restricted LOD was mainly attributed to the inhibition effect of the channel surface. Detection of the amplified products was carried out online using fluorescence microscopy with SybrGreen I.

Using the surface functionalization feature, CNTs can be used to immobilize antibodies or nucleic acid that target a type of virus. The process can be monitored using a change in the mechanical or electrical property of the CNTs (Bhattacharya et al., 2011). This concept has been recently used to detect hepatitis C viruses (Dastagir et al., 2007), avian influenza viruses (Zhu et al., 2009, Tam et al., 2009) and swine influenza viruses (Lee et al., 2011) other than foodborne viruses. As CNT-based biosensors are easy to produce, have reproducible results and are inexpensive, and since they have better sensitivity and time responses than current techniques, they are very promising for detecting viruses.",

The change in conductance is in response to binding between the target and the probe, which is attached to the nanowire (\nPatolsky et al., 2004, Valdivia-Granda et al., 2005). Nanowires act as a capture agent on the sensor surface and selectively bind target biomolecules much like CNTs (Ishikawa et al., 2009). Nanowires have several attractive features for the real-time detection of a single virus with high selectivity (Valdivia-Granda et al., 2005). Silicon nanowires have been used in label-free field effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors to detect influenza A viruses (Zheng et al., 2005) and dengue viruses (Zhang et al., 2010). The results showed that silicon nanowire-based sensors are more sensitive and have a more rapid response compared to traditional methods. Recently, an alternative nanomaterial to silicon nanowire, a metal oxide nanowire, has been used to detect a protein related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at a subnanomolar concentration in a background of 44 \u03bcM bovine serum albumin (Ishikawa et al., 2009).",

Currently, immunological and PCR-based methods are commonly used to detect viruses in food samples. Despite their reliability, most of these methods have limitations in terms of speed and sensitivity owing to low viral concentrations and inhibitory substances present in food. Even though methods for concentrating and purifying viruses in food samples have been widely investigated and developed, the inhibitory substances can remain and cause false-negative results.

It is anticipated that research using microfluidics will focus on combining the pretreatment of a viral sample and multiplex detection into a biochip. Thus, the microfluidic approach could be a promising platform for rapid detection of viruses. Additionally, the conjugation of antibodies, antigens and nucleic acids with quantum dots, nanowires and carbon nanotubes offers several advantages over current detection methods in terms of sensitivity and speed. These systems may also be used for the label-free detection of very low concentration of viral particles, or even for detecting a single virus without amplification.
