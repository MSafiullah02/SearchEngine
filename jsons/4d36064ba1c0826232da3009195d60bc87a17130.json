The current mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be ~2.5 nucleotides per month 3, 4 . Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can provide valuable information on virus biology, transmission and population dynamics [5] [6] [7] [8] . When linked with detailed epidemiological data and performed in a timescale of days, genomic data can support epidemiological investigations of potential hospital-acquired infections (HAI). On a larger population scale, genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can inform which lineages of the virus are currently circulating in the human population, how these change over time as an indicator of the success of control measures, how often new sources of virus are introduced from other geographic areas, and how the virus evolves in response to interventions.",

The burden of nosocomial COVID-19 infections is unknown but one study from China has reported a 41% prevalence 9 Worldwide, over 22,000 cases of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers have been reported, but is likely to be an underestimate 10 .

The possible transmission networks that we have identified were complex, involving patients and HCW in both community and hospital settings. However, we have also identified potential transmission networks in other environments including care homes, outpatient units and ambulance services, that have been poorly studied. Although there are strong epidemiological and genomic associations between cases, the mechanism and direction of transmissions remain unclear. The role of asymptomatic intermediates, fomites (including PPE) and the environment are not well understood and require further investigation. During the time frame of this study a number of infection control interventions were implemented across the hospital, as well as national public health measures to reduce community spread. Understanding the interaction between such interventions and nosocomial transmission are complex (especially in the context of the comparably long incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 relative to other respiratory viruses), but critical in enabling healthcare providers to safely deliver existing services in the context of a pandemic.",

We may therefore have missed the opportunity to investigate all potential transmission events. Furthermore, we only had main ward location data for most of the HCW and could have overlooked potential epidemiological links with patients with whom they had contact on other wards. Similarly, we were unable to track HCW movements outside their main ward location to identify potential contact with patients on other wards or HCW within shared communal areas. Finally, due to the recent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, highly similar genomes are not sufficient evidence to infer a recent transmission, in the absence of confirmatory epidemiological data. However, our experience indicates that further investigation of genomic clusters with highly similar genomes can uncover previously unknown epidemiological links. Furthermore, we were able to use rapidly generated genomic data to investigate HCAI within the hospital setting. The next initiative is to expand this platform into a more detailed analysis of infections in HCW and in community settings, such as residential homes. As the practical challenges associated with implementing real-time genome sequencing during epidemics are overcome, unlocking the real power of genomic epidemiology will require its integration with clinical and public health systems to support decisionmaking on local, national and international scales.

Reactions typically contained 25% extracted nucleic acid and were cycled through the following conditions 25\u00b0C 2min, 50\u00b0C 15min, 95\u00b0C 2min followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. Samples that generated a Ct value \u226436 were considered positive. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water) were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4600 pfu per extraction) prior to nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors or extraction issues. Positive control material, BetaCoV/England/02/2020, was obtained from PHE Colindale and was essentially purified virus RNA diluted down to give a cycle threshold value of 26-28. Negative controls included extracted molecular grade water.",

A 15 microlitre aliquot of the RNA extract of all CUH samples and a random selection of EoE samples were collected from the diagnostic microbiology laboratory for local sequencing. These were assigned COG-UK sequencing codes which were integrated back into the master metadata file. For samples that were not sequenced locally, the remaining RNA extract was collected from the diagnostic microbiology laboratory and sent to the Wellcome Sanger Institute for sequencing as part of the COG-UK consortium. Each week, clinical metadata and sequencing data were combined and formatted for upload to the MRC CLIMB system.

Diversification of lineages already present from earlier weeks was seen over time, with the detection of descendants of lineages B.1 and B.2, but no new lineages emerged during this period, likely an impact of lockdown measures preventing new viruses being introduced from other regions. Changes in lineage frequency may be stochastic due to changes in the available sample size during each week of the sampling period. Lineage B.8 was only detected in the week commencing 16 March 2020. Lineage B.4 viruses (associated with export from Iran) were not seen in our sample set.
