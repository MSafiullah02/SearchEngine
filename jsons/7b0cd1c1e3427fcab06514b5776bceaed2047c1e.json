Cytokines and CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ lymphocyte frequencies were assessed in uninfected controls and in response to immucillins. Urea, creatinine, GOT and GPT levels were monitored in sera. Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG1 antibodies (anti-NH36) increased in untreated animals. IgG2a response, high levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and lower levels of IL-10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85-89%) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35% lower secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD4+ T and CD19+ B cell frequencies.

IA and IH also inhibit the enzymatic activity of Leishmania (L.) donovani nucleoside hydrolase (NH36) one of the purine salvage enzymes in these purine auxotrophs. In this work, we compared the efficacies of IA, IH and SMIH to the standard drug Glucantime in the therapy of L. (L.) infantum chagasi infection of mice and hamsters. IA and IH, at low concentrations, cured mice and hamsters from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Unlike treatment with Glucantime, immucillin therapy showed no toxicity. We demonstrate that treatment of IA and IH also affects the induction of the immune system, a factor that might also contribute to VL therapy.

Their disadvantages include high toxicity (vomiting, arthralgia, hepatitis, pancreatitis and cardiac dysrhythmias), high cost [11] , resistance issues in India [13, 14] and in HIV patients [4, 15, 16] and intravenous administration during hospitalization. The intravenous alternative drug, Amphotericin B, alone or in liposomal formulations [13, 14, 17] , causes fever, nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia [18] . It also requires hospitalization but is not related to major resistance problems. Paromomicin, of comparable efficacy to Amphotericin, induces nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Pentamidine therapy in India was halted because of its decreased cure rate and adverse side effects [17, 19] . Recently, oral therapy with Miltefosine showed 94% of success rates in India [20] but only 50% of cure rates in Brazil [21] . The same compounds are used for the therapy of canine leishmaniasis in Europe, with controversial success [22] . The use of combined therapies reduces time and cost of treatment and avoids the selection of resistant parasites [14, 23] . Protozoan parasites lack de novo purine synthetic pathways and have developed robust salvage pathways, where no single enzyme is predicted to be essential [24] . The inhibitory potential of iminoribitols substituted with aromatic groups against nucleoside hydrolases (NH) of protozoan parasites was established in the 90s and led us to test them here [25] [26] [27] . The nucleoside hydrolase NH36 of L. (L.) donovani is also the main antigen of the Leishmune vaccine used for prevention and therapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis [5, 7, 8] . Immucillin ImmA (IA) and ImmH (IH) are examples of synthetic deazapurine iminosugar-C-nucleoside synthetic transition state analogues [28] . We recently assayed the effects of IA, IH, SMIH and of immucillins DADMe-ImmA (DIA), DADMe-ImmH (DIH), DADMe-ImmG (DIG), SerMe-ImmG (SMIG) and SerMe-ImmA (SMIA) on the L. (L.) donovani recombinant NH36 enzymatic activity [29] . IA and IH inhibited the NH36 enzymatic activity with Ki = 0.080 \u03bcM for IA and 0.019 \u03bcM for IH. Inhibition of the growth of L. (L.) infantum chagasi and L. (L.) amazonensis promastigotes in vitro was obtained using nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of IA, IH, DIH, DIG, SMIH and SMIG. As transition state analogues of N-ribosyl transferases they are stable chemical mimics of the enzymatic transition state and bind tighter than the respective substrate molecules. Of these, IA, IH and SMIH at 10 \u03bcM concentration inhibited 95% of the intracellular replication of L. (L.) infantum chagasi amastigotes in vitro causing no apparent damage to macrophage viability. IA and IH were less toxic and more potent than Glucantime [29] .",

Expression of the recombinant NH36 was obtained by induction with 0.5mM IPTG and overnight incubation at 20\u00b0C. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets submitted to sonication during 10 minutes with cycles of 30 sec. and intervals of 55 sec. Sonicates were centrifuged and their supernatants separated for purification by column chromatography using Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen, USA). The column was eluted with a 50mM potassium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl buffer, pH: 8.0, using a 50 to 300mM imidazole gradient [29] .

All these cut-off values obtained the Youden index = 1 a value which indicates the absence of false positive and false negative results. The set of antibody means of normal uninfected and of infected mice differ by 15 (day 1), 10 (day15) and 5 (day 30) standard deviations, respectively, indicating the accuracy of the test.

There was a slight decrease to 57% at day 30 following chemotherapy ( Fig 4B) . IgG1 antibody responses suggested that the efficacy of immucillins in control of infection is compatible with that of Glucantime. However, the results of the IgG2a subtype indicated that a stronger antibody response is induced by immucillins ( Fig 4C) . Immucillins and Glucantime generated high anti-NH36 IgG2a responses ( Fig 4C) if compared to untreated infected controls, which remained at basal levels (P <0.001). IgG2a increases in the IA, IH and SMIH groups (79-77%) started from 1 day following chemotherapy, with no decline until day 30, suggesting a rapid onset of infection control. Glucantime treatment, resulted in a slower IgG2a response (67% at day 1) (P < 0.001), and reached maximal values only at day 30. IA and IH were more potent than Glucantime and IH induced an IgG2a stronger response than SMIH (day 1 and 15) ( Fig 4C) .",

To explore this hypothesis we treated normal uninfected mice with each immucillin or with Glucantime, and incubated their splenocytes in vitro in the presence of lysate of L. (L.) infantum or NH36 (Fig 6) . The secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in response to lysate or NH36 was enhanced only on day 15, in mice treated with all drugs. Immucillins promoted a higher IFN-\u03b3 than Glucantime (Fig 6) . The response of uninfected animals (Fig 6) however, was 35% lower than in uninfected animals (Figs 5 and 6) and transient. Different from infected animals (Fig 5) , a slight enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 secretion was observed in uninfected mice, only on day 1, which did not last (Fig 6) . This was induced in response to the lysate by all drug treatments, and to NH36, only in SMIH treated mice (Fig 6) . As expected, the IL-10 secretion of normal mice was reduced by 47% and 73%, in response to lysate and NH36, respectively, when compared to those of infected saline-treated controls ( Fig  5) . The IL-10 response was mainly increased in SMIH treated mice, to lysate, and in Glucantime treated animals, in response to NH36 (Fig 6) . We conclude that the overall cytokine response of immucillin and Glucantime treated uninfected animals suggests that immucillins might also have a moderate but direct effect on T cells which contributes to the cure of VL.",

All immucillins and Glucantime increased the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by~50% (day 15) in the supernatant of drug treated mice. This level reaches 35% of the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by splenocytes of infected animals (Fig 5) . A similar pattern, but to a lower extent, was observed for the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, at day 1, and for the secretion of IL-10, with the exception of SMIH, at day 15 (Fig 6) . Noteworthy, IL-10 levels in Glucantime treated mice (509 pg/ml) were higher than in IA treated mice (113 pg/ml; p<0.05). Levels of IFN-\u03b3 were 3 times higher (~1500 pg/ml) than those of TNF-\u03b1 (~500 pg/ml) (Fig 6) . Although the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in mice treated after infection (Fig 5) were 35% higher (2,200 to 2,370 pg/ml) than in uninfected treated mice (Fig  7) , mainly in the case of IA, we demonstrated that a robust cytokine response is induced in lymphocytes by immucillin treatments. Furthermore, the effect of immucillins is evident in the increase of lymphocyte populations in treated mouse spleens (Fig 7) . IA induced the most pronounced enhancement of CD4+ T cells frequencies, showing 57%, 21% and 29% higher proportions than the levels of the previously untreated controls, on days 1, 15 and 30, respectively (Fig 7) . IH also enhanced CD4+ T cell counts however, on both, treated and untreated mice, while Glucantime, promoted a high CD4+ T cell increase (p<0.05) only on day 1. SMIH treated mice showed lower CD4+ T cell frequencies (Fig 7) . Our results suggest that the decrease in parasite load promoted by immucillins is due their inhibitory effect on parasite replication and to the induction of a TH1 immunogenic response.",

Hamsters developed a greater liver parasite load (16,334 LDU) (Fig 9) than BALB/c mice (2,765 LDU) (Fig 2) , but gave similar responses to immucillins (Figs 2 and 9 ). Parasite load reductions of 86% and 70% were induced by IA (2,038 LDU) and IH (4,905 LDU) treatments, respectively (p < 0.001). Treatment with SMIH gave no cure (Fig 9) . Accordingly, an increase in body weight was promoted by IA, IH and Glucantime, but not by SMIH (Fig 8) . Leishmania infection promoted a high increase of blood urea levels, that were reduced by~50% by Glucantime, IH and SMIH. All drugs, promoted a decreased of creatinine to normal levels (Fig 8) which was more pronounced after IA (66%) or IH (63%) than after Glucantime (41%) treatment. GOT levels increased after infection and IH, but not other immucillins, reduced them b\u1ef9 30%. GPT was unchanged. We conclude that, in mice, immucillins IA, IH and SMIH show higher potency and earlier onset of generation of IgG2a antibodies than the standard drug Glucantime. IA induced higher secretion of IFN-\u03b3, more gain in body weight and a better reduction of spenomegaly than Glucantime, while causing similar levels of liver parasite burden and much lower toxicity. The direct action of IA, IH and SMIH on mice lymphocyte responses partially contribute to the success of chemotherapy of VL. IA induces a TH1 response, followed by IH. Although all immucillins were strongly therapeutic in mice, a superiority of IA was observed in most of the variables. This probably explains why IA is the most effective against VL in hamsters where SMIH show no therapeutic effect. Efficacy of Immucillins in the Therapy of Visceral Leishmaniasis",

IA showed the highest curative effect in mice and also promoted cure of VL in hamsters. The enhancement of anti-NH36 IgG antibodies in all infected groups, confirmed that NH36 is an important marker of VL infection, not only in dogs [44] but also, in BALB/c mice. Of note, the anti-NH36 IgG1 antibodies increased only in the infected untreated controls and were reduced by day 30, when the spontaneous control of infection occurs [45] . In agreement with our results with immucillins, much higher levels of IgG1 were found in infected, than in cisplatin treated BALB/c mice [30, 31] or uninfected controls [30] soon after complete chemotherapy. The lower levels of IgG1 and higher titers of IgG2a anti-NH36 antibodies, which correlate to the decreased parasite burden, suggested a pronounced switch to the TH1 response, promoted by the treatments with IA, IH followed by SMIH or Glucantime. Glucantime induction of the IgG2a humoral response was however slower than that of immucillins. Of note, the enhancement of the IgG2a response by immucillins was 80%, by Miltefosin, 75% [46] and by cisplatin, only 50-55% [30, 31] .",

Treatment with immucillins or 1,3,4-tiadiazolium-2 aminide compounds [48] induced also higher IFN-\u03b3 responses than Glucantime. IL-10 is the hallmark of pathology in VL, and was 72% reduced, 1 day after complete treatment with immucillins, and was 50% and 75% reduced at the same time following treatment with cisplatin [30, 31] or 1,3,4-tiadiazolium-2 aminide [48] , respectively. As previously described [47, [49] [50] [51] [52] the TH2 response in VL is best represented by IL-10 but not by IL-4. Most reports in literature use promastigote lysate antigen for stimulation of cytokine expression. We showed that NH36 is equally potent reinforcing its relevance as a Leishmania infection marker [44, 53, 54] . In our investigation, the remarkable change observed in the immune response could be due to the decreasing in parasite load or to direct immunologic changes induced by immucillins. Such changes have been shown with antimony [55] . Although IFN-\u03b3 secretion was high after immucillin treatment in infected animals, 35% lower IFN-\u03b3 secretion was also observed in uninfected animals treated with immucillins, either in response to leishmanial antigens or to immucillins. A lower but significant secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and decreased response of IL-10 were also observed. These results suggest that immucillins are capable of inducing a TH1 response through their direct effect on T cells. This effect may contribute to the successful chemotherapy of VL.",

            "text": "Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) has been shown to activate both the innate and adaptive immune system by indirectly activating pathways for ROS and NO generation [55] , imparting in this way resistance to leishmania infection and reinfection. SAG induces proliferation of T cells but not of B cells and upregulates the IFN-\u03b3 receptors [55] . We showed that pre-treatment with IA, IH and SMIH induced significantly high secretion of IFN-\u03b3, followed by TNF-\u03b1 with a low secretion of IL-10. Enhancements in proportions of CD4 + -T and CD19 + B cells at all times and a transient increase in CD8 + T cell frequencies were also promoted by previous treatment only with IA. The increase of CD4+ T cell frequencies by immucillins is noteworthy since resistance to Leishmania (L.) infantum infection has been shown to be related to the function and frequencies of CD4+ T cells [56] [57] [58] [59] . A lower and transient lymphoproliferative effect was determined by Glucantime in our model. IH showed equal stimulation of CD4+ T, CD8 + T and CD19 + B cell expansions in previously treated and untreated mice. Differently, SMIH decreased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies but enhanced the proportions of CD19+ B cells. These preliminary results might explain the direct induction of a TH1 response and the strong Leishmania antibody response promoted by IA and IH, which contributed to their success in cure of mice VL. Despite the induction of an IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and antibody response similar to IA and IH, SMIH did not stimulate T cell proliferation and apparently acts via its potent leishmanicidal toxicity [29] . SMIH impaired stimulation on CD4+ T cell proliferation might also explain its lack of efficacy in hamsters, a more susceptible host. We conclude that, as suggested for Glucantime and Pentamidine, the efficacy of IA and IH immucillins is also partially T-cell dependent [60] .",

SMIH has been shown to be orally available in mice inhibiting blood PNP for long periods [28] . IH (forodesine) is also effective as a PNP inhibitor against leukemia cells [61] . In spite of the theoretical concern regarding the association of PNP inhibition and immunodeficiency, we showed that in normal healthy mice, IH stimulates the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+-T and CD19+-B cells after direct contact or systemic previous treatment.",

While infected untreated mice show small weight gains and increased spleens and livers, therapy with IA led to the highest body weight gain and the lowest spleen weight observed in all therapies, including Glucantime. As described for cisplatin [32] , animals treated with the other immucillins and Glucantime also exhibited favorable liver and spleen weight profiles. Most importantly, infected controls developed~3000 LDU units in livers on day 21 after infection, similar to mice infected with L. (L.) infantum chagasi [33] or L. (L.) donovani [30] [31] [32] 46] . Treatment with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime caused a decrease in parasite burden starting from day 1 after complete chemotherapy and removing 85-89% of the amastigotes by day 30. IA showed the strongest efficacy (89%) while cisplatin caused reductions of 50% [32] , 75% [30] or 80% [31] and Miltefosin [46] , of 50%. The early control of infection, may reflect both the direct anti-Leishmania therapeutic efficacy of immucillins and their stimulatory effect on the TH1 response. Our clinical, immunological and parasitological results support efficacy of immucillins in therapy of VL with a preference of IA.",

In the BALB/c model the drug was assayed at 20 mg/kg [62] starting from day 5 after infection, for 30 consecutive days or, alternatively, at 10, 25 or 50mg/kg/day [63] [64] [65] . Immucillins, are more effective and safe at lower concentrations and in shorter protocols. Therapy with Glucantime caused an 88% reduction in parasite load but increased levels of GOT and GTP. Elevated hepatic transaminases have also been reported among the most severe side effects of effective therapy with antimonials [66, 67] , cisplatin [32] or T. cordifolia [30] , many days after the end of the treatment. In contrast to what proposed previously [55] , these [30] [31] [32] and our results suggest that the severe increase of liver enzymes after chemotherapy of VL with Glucantime, is due to the direct hepatotoxic effect of the drug, rather than to the killing of parasites, as serum GOT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged [68] . In agreement with that, Kato et al., [69] reported swollen and apoptotic hepatocytes in animals treated with Glucantime. Therefore, while all the current medications against VL are associated with hepatic toxicity [68, 70] , we demonstrated that the treatment of mice with immucilins is not.",
