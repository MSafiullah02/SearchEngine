Staff in the hospital used MRSA (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) airborne strict isolation measures and PPE (gloves, FFP2 masks and gowns). Upon suspicion of Lassa fever, C1 was relocated in a dedicated ambulance (Ambulance 2) to the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC, Hospital 2) dedicated facility for treatment of highly contagious infections. The diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed on 20 November by RT-PCR and genome sequencing performed at Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam.

C2 was transported in a dedicated ambulance (Ambulance 3) to the Major Incident Hospital at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU, Hospital 3), and admitted to a facility for highly contagious infections. C2 was discharged on 12 December, after two negative results within an interval of 48 h in serum tests for presence of LASV RNA. The patient was discharged into home isolation; as LASV RNA remained positive in the urine, strict instructions regarding hygiene were enforced until urine tested negative after 12 days. ",
