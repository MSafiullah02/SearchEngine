            "text": "The DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, which is part of the heterotrimeric translation initiation complex eIF4F, unwinds RNA secondary structures in 5\u2032-UTRs of selected mRNAs to enable binding of the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) (Bhat et al., 2015; Wolfe et al., 2014). In cells, eIF4A has a critical role in the translation of protooncogenic mRNAs with complex-structured 5\u2032-UTRs (Wolfe et al., 2014; Rubio et al., 2014). Viral mRNAs also contain structured 5\u2032-UTRs (Madhugiri et al., 2015; Schlereth et al., 2016), suggesting that viral protein synthesis may also be eIF4A-dependent. Indeed, we have shown that the specific eIF4A inhibitor Silvestrol, a plant-derived rocaglate, has broad-spectrum antiviral activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations in a low nanomolar range (M\u00fcller et al., 2018a). Silvestrol inhibits the replication of RNA viruses representing different virus families, such as Ebola- (EBOV), corona- (CoV), Zika- (ZIKV), Chikungunya- (CHIKV) and hepatitis E (HEV) viruses (M\u00fcller et al., 2018a; Biedenkopf et al., 2017; Elgner et al., 2018; Glitscher et al., 2018; Henss et al., 2018). Notably, Silvestrol showed good bioavailability (Sarahdi et al., 2011), in vivo antiviral activity (Todt et al., 2018) and remarkably low cytotoxicity in primary cells, thus opening a broad therapeutic window for future applications. To date, however, chemical synthesis of Silvestrol remains difficult and alternative strategies are highly desirable. An example of a structurally less complex natural rocaglate with antiviral activity is RocA (Too et al., 2018), lacking the dioxane moiety of Silvestrol (Pan et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of the synthetic RocA analog CR-31-B (\u2212) (Wolfe et al., 2014, Fig. 1\n) and compared its activity with that of Silvestrol. CR-31-B (\u2212) showed similar antiviral activity against HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, LASV, CCHFV and, to a lesser extent, HEV, thus identifying CR-31-B (\u2212) as another rocaglate with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, we also found differential activities for these two compounds, depending on the viral 5\u2032-UTR used for the translation inhibition assays. As shown for RocA, clamping of RNA substrates onto eIF4A by CR-31-B (\u2212) requires polypurine sequences (Iwasaki et al., 2019), whereas Silvestrol can also clamp polypurine-free viral RNA substrates, provided that a stable hairpin structure is present. The recently published crystal structure of human eIF4A in complex with a polypurine RNA substrate and RocA (Iwasaki et al., 2019) explains the observed polypurine dependency of RocA because only purines can efficient stack on the phenyl rings of RocA. Although, further structure-based information is missing, we suggest that the dioxane moiety of Silvestrol can mediate polypurine-free RNA clamping onto eIF4A.",

At a concentration of 100 nM CR-31-B (\u2212), the MERS-CoV titer was reduced by about 5 log levels (Suppl. Fig. S2A). Cytotoxicity tests using MRC-5 cells revealed that CR-31-B (\u2212) and CR-31-B (+) caused a slight reduction of cell viability by 10\u201325% and 10%, respectively, if the cells were incubated for 24 h with concentrations of up to 5 \u03bcM of the respective compound (Suppl. Fig. S2B), indicating low cytotoxicities for both compounds with selectivity indices of >1000 (see Table 1\n). Even if the cells were treated for extended periods of time (48 and 72 h) using concentrations of up to 1 \u03bcM, no major cytotoxic effects were observed for CR-31-B (Fig. S2C). We further determined the CC50 values of a racemic mixture of CR-31-B using a range of human liver and skin carcinoma cell lines as well as primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). As expected, CC50 values in all analyzed cancer cell lines (7 liver and 3 skin carcinoma cell lines) were found to be in the low nanomolar range whereas the CC50 in primary HDF was calculated at ~ 500 nM (Fig. S3). Taken together, our data demonstrate low cytotoxicity of CR-31-B (\u2212) in primary cells compared to the known cytotoxic effects in fast growing cancer cell lines.",

In the present study, we found that also CR-31-B (\u2212) causes a strong reduction of ZIKV RNA levels with a calculated EC50 value of 1.13 nM (Table 1; Suppl. Fig. S4). To assess potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities of CR-31-B (\u2212) and Silvestrol against other highly pathogenic emerging viruses, we analyzed their effects in primary murine hepatocytes infected with LASV or CCHFV (Fig. 4\n). The data revealed that CR-31-B (\u2212) and Silvestrol have potent antiviral activities with EC50 values between ~20 and 50 nM with no detectable cytotoxicity at concentrations of up to 10 \u03bcM (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Virus titers showed a ~4-log drop for LASV- and a 3-log drop for CCHFV-infected cells (Fig. 4A,C). Furthermore, we analyzed if CR-31-B (\u2212) inhibits HEV replication (Fig. 5\n). Persistently HEV-infected A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of Silvestrol and the two CR-31-B enantiomers. At 72 hpi the extracellular viral RNA levels, which correlate with released viral particles, were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. In line with our previous results (Glitscher et al., 2018), we confirmed the antiviral activity of Silvestrol, while the antiviral effect of CR-31-B (\u2212) against HEV was found to be slightly weaker at the low nanomolar concentrations used in this assay (Fig. 5). However, some cytotoxicity of Silvestrol was already observed at a concentration of 2 nM whereas CR-31-B was not cytotoxic at this concentration, yet at 10 nM some cytotoxicity of CR-31-B (\u2212) could be observed (~35% reduced viability) in persistently HEV-infected A549 cells (Fig. S5).",

The 5\u2032-UTRs of HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV and EBOV VP30 mRNA were found to be similarly sensitive to translation inhibition by Silvestrol and CR-31-B (\u2212) (Fig. 6\nA). In contrast, the 5\u2032-UTR of EBOV VP35 was insensitive to CR-31-B (\u2212) but sensitive to Silvestrol. Interestingly, the VP30 and VP35 mRNAs both carry a likely inaccessible pentapurine stretch in their 5\u2032-terminal stem structures (Fig. 6A). However, in the VP30 5\u2032-UTR, this pentapurine stretch is followed by a decapurine stretch that seems to be unstructured and thus predicted to enable RNA clamping (Iwasaki et al., 2019). Such a second purine stretch is absent in the VP35 5\u2032-UTR. The 5\u2032-terminal hairpin of VP35 alone was sufficient to mediate translation inhibition by Silvestrol. Surprisingly, this hairpin increased the reporter activity about twofold in the presence of CR-31-B (\u2212) (Fig. 6A, VP35-HP only). This increase was reduced back to baseline levels if an additional (AG)5-polypurine stretch was inserted at the 3\u2032-end of the VP35 hairpin. Also, this insertion resulted in a slightly increased translation inhibition by Silvestrol, indicating that polypurine sequences strengthen the inhibitory effects of rocaglates on eIF4A (Fig. 6A, VP35-HP+(AG)5).",

As shown before, HEV replication can be inhibited by Silvestrol (Glitscher et al., 2018) and, to a slightly lesser extent, by CR-31-B (\u2212) (Fig. 5). Therefore, we asked if the polypurine-free 5\u2032-UTR of HEV is also sensitive to Silvestrol or CR-31-B (\u2212) treatment. At a concentration of 10 nM Silvestrol, the 5\u2032-UTR of HEV mediated reduced luciferase activity, demonstrating that Silvestrol can indeed clamp this viral RNA onto eIF4A. Importantly, this was not the case for CR-31-B (\u2212) treatment (Fig. 6B, HEVgt3c). Moreover, this indicated that the dioxane moiety of Silvestrol may play a critical role in clamping structured RNAs onto eIF4A in a polypurine-independent manner. To test this assumption, the HEV 5\u2032-UTR hairpin structure was thermodynamically destabilized by disrupting one or two base pairs in the stem (Fig. 6B, HEVgt3c-G4C and HEVgt3c-G4CC6A). These changes led to a gradual loss of the inhibitory effect of Silvestrol. To further analyze the relevance of polypurine stretches in viral 5\u2032-UTRs, the sequence in the HEV 5\u2032-UTR was changed at the 5\u2032-end from 5\u2032-GCAGACCA\u2026 into 5\u2032-GGAGAGGA... (Fig. 6B, HEVgt3c-Purine), thereby introducing a stretch of 8 consecutive purines. Although the thermodynamic stability of the hairpin structure was reduced by these sequence changes, the HEVgt3c-Purine 5\u2032-UTR became now sensitive to CR-31-B (\u2212) and Silvestrol treatment (Fig. 6B, HEVgt3c-Purine).",

Since no structural data from co-crystallization of Silvestrol, RNA and eIF4A are available, we modeled the structure of Silvestrol into the published eIF4A-polyAG structure surface (Iwasaki et al., 2019). By comparing the localization of RocA and Silvestrol, we found that the dioxane moiety of Silvestrol can completely cross the surface of the bound RNA substrate, thus enabling Silvestrol to make additional contacts e.g. via H-bonds to arginines in eIF4A which cannot be formed in the absence of the dioxane moiety (Fig. 7\n). This suggests that Silvestrol is able to clamp RNA without an absolute requirement for stacking interactions with purine bases because stabilizing interactions with eIF4A at the proximal side of the bound RNA may be sufficient for locking the RNA on the helicase.",

These differentiated airway epithelial cells were used as a model for the primary airway defense barrier against inhaled pathogens, mimicking the natural situation in the infected host. This system provides a pseudostratified organization of basal, ciliated, goblet and other less common types of cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining airway homeostasis by regulating innate and acquired immunity through the production of a wide range of cytokines as well as chemokines (Davies, 2014).

Thus, if no RNA clamping by rocaglates occurs, active eIF4A retains its ability to unwind secondary structures in the bound substrate RNA. In our reporter assays, Silvestrol was able to clamp polypurine-free stable hairpin structures onto eIF4A, whereas CR-31-B (\u2212) required an accessible polypurine-sequence in close proximity to the 5\u2032-terminal hairpin. This conclusion is supported by data showing that translation of the reporter construct containing the EBOV VP35 5\u2032-UTR is insensitive to CR-31-B (\u2212) while it is sensitive to Silvestrol. Reduced hairpin stability correlated with a loss in Silvestrol sensitivity, suggesting that thermodynamic stability of hairpin structures is of critical importance. This is also supported by our observation that introduction of an unstructured (AC)15 sequence rendered the reporter construct insensitive to both Silvestrol and CR-31-B (\u2212), whereas an (AG)15 polypurine sequence, which might be able to form a stable hairpin structure by making non-Watson-Crick G-A basepair contacts, strongly require the helicase activity of eIF4A. Remodeling the structure of Silvestrol onto the surface of the published eIF4A-RNA structure revealed that Silvestrol is in principle capable to contact eIF4A via phenylalanine (Phe163) at the lateral (Iwasaki et al., 2019) and via arginines at the proximal site of the bound substrate RNA (Fig. 7). This leads us to suggest that Silvestrol may be able to clamp any RNA sequence onto eIF4A. Our results (Fig. 6B) indicate that an unstructured sequence of sufficient length, e.g. the (AC)15 sequence does not require the helicase activity of eIF4A to allow 43S PIC binding as a prerequisite for translation initiation, whereas a stable hairpin structure likely prevents 43S PIC binding and thus needs to be unwound.",

Moreover, polypurine sequences in the 5\u2032-UTR were found to be required for rocaglate-dependent clamping onto eIF4A if the dioxane moiety of Silvestrol is missing as shown for the synthetic CR-31-B (\u2212) compound. Our data also suggest that Silvestrol retains its ability to clamp RNA substrates containing a stable hairpin structure in cases where polypurine sequences are not accessible (see the VP35 5\u2032-UTR) or absent (see the HEV 5\u2032-UTR).",
