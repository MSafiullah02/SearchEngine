However, in their Commentary, Brian Tomlinson and Clive Cockram (May 3, p 1486)2 state that fever is not always a cardinal feature and can be absent in elderly people with the disease. Television news programmes have shown pictures of people at airports having their temperatures taken with aural thermometers as part of a screening measure for SARS.",
