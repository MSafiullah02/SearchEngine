Furthermore, 3 -11% of travelers to tropical areas report febrile illnesses on their return [Bruni and Steffen, 1997; Hill, 2000; Steffen et al., 2003; Antinori et al., 2004] . Nowadays, epidemiological investigations of health risks in travelers have focused on infections perceived as specific for this population, such as malaria, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and other travel-related vaccine-preventable diseases [Humar and Keystone, 1996; Magill, 1998; Parola et al., 2006 ]. In spite of exhaustive studies and widely different diagnosis of febrile illnesses, some cases remain without an etiological diagnosis. It is thought that a percentage of these cases could be due to viral respiratory tract infections. In Spain, most people travel in August and September where tropical areas experience local variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. These conditions are optimal for the circulation of respiratory viruses.",

Within the first 24 hr, nasopharyngeal swabs were processed for antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Samples were stained with fluorescein-conjugated antibody to influenza virus A, influenza virus B, human parainfluenza virus 1-3, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (Respiratory Panel 1, Viral Screening and Identification Kit; Light Diagnostics, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The presence of viral antigen in respiratory cells was indicated by the appearance of characteristic intracellular apple-green fluorescence in 1 cell. Upon sample collection, an aliquot of each fresh specimen was collected to be used for RT-PCR analysis. Nucleic acids from any DNA/RNA viruses present in the nasopharyngeal swab were extracted from 200 ml of specimen using NucliSense easyMAG (BioM\u00e9reieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lysis buffer included 500 molecules of the cloned amplified product used as internal control in each reaction tube and then excluded false-negative results due to nonspecific inhibitors or extraction failure. Two independent multiplex nested RT-PCR assays were used to detect influenza virus A, influenza virus B, influenza virus C, respiratory syncytial virus, respiratory syncytial virus B and adenovirus [Coiras et al., 2003] , and, human parainfluenza virus 1-4A and 4B, human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus OC43 and the generic detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus [Coiras et al., 2004] . All positive results were confirmed in two sequential assays. A RT-PCR previously standardized by the Spanish National Center of Microbiology (Instituto de Salud Carlos III) that amplifies H1, H3, and H5 subtypes viruses, was performed in the influenza A positive samples. Retrospectively, a RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus was performed using the fusion (F) and polymerase (L) genes as targets. A negative (viral transport medium containing no nucleic acid) and positive control obtained from our viral isolates was included in each assay in order to control extraction and amplification handling.",

In a recent study carried out in Switzerland [Mutsch et al., 2005] among 1,450 travelers returning from tropical and subtropical countries, seroconversion for influenza virus infection was found in 27 (12.8%) out of 211 travelers that provided paired serum samples. However, whether influenza virus infection occurred just before home departure, en route, abroad, or shortly upon return cannot be ruled out. We obtained similar results concerning influenza virus.
