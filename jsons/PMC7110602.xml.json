The association of baseline characteristics with the risk of VRI was analyzed using Cox proportional cause-specific hazards model. For models involving all VRIs by different virus groups for a patient (whether at the same time or not), a robust sandwich estimator of the variance of the parameters was used to account for potential correlation at the patient level.

A higher incidence of HCoV/HRV as compared with other VRIs confirms the findings of Milano et al. [5]. However, unlike the systematic sampling in the Milano study, our samples were only collected in patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients only presenting mild symptoms probably did not seek medical attention as often as those with more severe infection. This selection bias can explain (1) that all patients with VRIs in our study seem to have similar clinical presentation, including similar pneumonia prevalence, and (2) an underestimation of general VRI incidence. Our study includes patients followed up to 3 years after transplantation showing that VRIs continue to occur at a high frequency in the late post-transplant phase. Overall, the long-term data on VRIs after allogeneic HSCT is limited. Martino et al. [2] reported a 2-year incidence of VRIs detected by immunofluorescence or viral culture close to our results (29% at 2 years versus 40% at 3 years in our study). Virus repartition differed from ours with a lower frequency of HRV, which can be attributed to the lower sensitivity of their detection method [2].",

            "text": "Finally, the mortality rate attributable to VRIs was not as high as expected and was not associated with a particular virus. In this study, the cause of death could not clearly be concluded to be from VRIs: the patients who died from viral pneumonia all had other significant and potentially fatal comorbidities. We observed that risk factors for mortality in VRI patients were steroid dose and lymphopenia, as reported in other studies, although we cannot discriminate if these risk factors are specific for patients with VRIs or common to all transplanted patients 1, 6, 10, 11. Indeed, steroid and lymphopenia reflect a poor general condition of the patient, severe GVHD, and/or delayed immune reconstitution. Because VRI was not a risk factor for overall mortality in this cohort, one can argue that the immune status might have more of an impact than the infection itself (data not shown). It is noteworthy that in this long-term study, the time from transplantation to VRI had no effect on the prognosis, probably because the general status of the patients has a higher impact on the outcome.",

To conclude, we estimate that nasopharyngeal aspirates to identify VRIs in patients with respiratory symptoms can be restricted to patients with a profound immune defect or those with lower respiratory tract involvement who could benefit from careful clinical monitoring until recovery.",
