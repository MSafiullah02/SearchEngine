            "text": "Microbial infections have long been recognized for their potential to alter phenotypes. Infections that result in premature death or clinical signs of disease have obvious impact on phenotype and research using contaminated animals. In other cases, infections may be subclinical but alter the normal microscopic anatomy of infected animals. Subclinical infections also pose a significant risk to the research conducted with affected animals because they can alter the physiology (notably immune function) of experimental subjects or experimental endpoints such as tumor kinetics. These adverse effects have been summarized in a number of reviews (Baker 1998, 2003; Lipman and Perkins 2002; Nicklas et al. 1999; NRC 1991). With the advent of gene array tools, recognition of altered homeostasis has also extended to differential gene expression (Myles et al. 2003).",

Moreover, interactions between microbe and host and the resulting manifestations of disease may differ between GEM and their inbred or outbred counterparts. Alteration of phenotype may occur with microbes that are known to cause disease (pathogens) or with opportunists. In this article, the definition of opportunist proposed by Smith (1998) is used\u2014an organism capable of causing disease only in a host whose resistance is lowered, for example by other diseases, drugs, or genetic manipulation. The latter is critical to a discussion of GEM inasmuch as these animals may have phenotypes associated with organisms previously unrecognized as opportunists.",

            "text": "\nP. carinii is a well-defined pathogen of T-cell-deficient, nude, and T- and B-cell-deficient SCID mice. Infections in these mice result in alveolitis characterized by the filling of alveoli by foamy exudate that contains abundant organisms and few host inflammatory cells (primarily macrophages) (Percy and Barthold 2001b). The life span of these mice is in turn shortened, and their utility in certain studies (i.e., those involving the respiratory tract) is severely compromised. P. carinii has also emerged as a problematic opportunist in GEM (Furuta et al. 2001; Macy et al. 2000; Marcotte et al. 1996). This development is likely due to its prevalence in colonies of immunocompetent mice and the fact that many GEM have predicted or unpredicted defects in immune responses. Recently, P. carinii exudative alveolitis, similar to that seen in SCID and nude mice, was identified in CD40 ligand (CD40L) knockout mice (Furuta et al. 2001). CD40L is expressed on T cells, and engagement with CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs1) and B cells results in activation of both T and B cells (Grewal et al. 1997). Experimental studies have demonstrated the critical role of both B and T cell activation as well as other cellular interactions (i.e., T cell: APC) via CD40:CD40L interactions in defense against P. carinii (Lund et al. 2003; Wiley and Harmsen 1995). Thus, it is not surprising that these CD40L knockout mice developed P. carinii pneumonia.",

Infections of immunodeficient mice often manifest as conjunctivitis, otitis, or multiorgan abscess formation (Figure 1) (Percy and Barthold 2001a). Likewise, P. pneumotropica infections have resulted in disease in several mutant mice including CD28, CXCR2, and E2F4 knockouts (Artwohl et al. 2000; Humbert et al. 2000). CD28 is expressed on T cells, and engagement with its ligand, B7, on APCs results in T cell activation (Abass and Lichtman 2003a). Artwohl and colleagues (2000) described an outbreak of orbital abscesses in STOCK-Cd28tm1Mak mice from which P. pneumotropicawas isolated. These authors concluded that the lack of CD28 may have impaired normal T cell activation and rendered mice more susceptible to this infection.",

Affected mice were homozygous for the mutation and of a mixed genetic background (CBA;Cg-Il8rbtm1Mwm/J); mice heterozygous for the mutation and wild-type counterparts were unaffected. Murine CXCR2 is the receptor for several CXC chemokines (e.g., KC and MIP-2) and is important in recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (Moore et al. 2000; Tsai et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2001). Neutrophils are critical innate immune effector cells in the control of bacterial infections. The importance of CXCR2 in infectious disease was demonstrated in mice with experimental Lyme arthritis wherein neutrophils were marginalized within blood vessels of joints but did not enter tissues (Brown et al. 2003). Moreover blockade of CXCR2 in several murine models of bacterial pneumonia resulted in significant increases in mouse mortality associated with marked decreases in neutrophils recruitment (Moore et al. 2000; Tateda et al. 2001; Tsai et al. 2000). Thus, it is likely that the CXCR2 knockout mice with P. pneumotropica pneumonia were unable to mount an appropriate and timely neutrophil-mediated defense against this opportunist.",

Ceacam1 is the gene encoding a signaling receptor that is implicated in several physiological functions, including immune functions (Markel et al. 2004; Schmitter et al. 2004; Skubitz et al. 2001). In addition, Ceacam1 serves as a receptor for a number of bacterial and viral pathogens (Hill et al. 2005; Zelus et al. 2003). Although it is tempting to speculate that the overexpression of this gene resulted in increased susceptibility to pasteurellosis, the speculation is difficult to confirm because wild-type mice from the report cited above also developed disease (Matsumiya and Lavoie 2003). This uncertainty highlights that care should be taken when establishing the role of an infectious agent in any phenotype alteration, including those seen in GEM. When a microbial agent is found to be associated with phenotype alteration, it is tempting to implicate that agent in that phenotype change immediately. However, as described below, controlled studies are warranted to fully explore the role of these agents in phenotype alterations.",

Notably, nude mice can develop folliculitis and furunculosis of the muzzle leading to coalescing abscess formation often referred to as botryomycosis (Percy and Barthold 2001a). Likewise, certain strains of GEM have been found to have an increased incidence of staphylococcal botryomycosis. As an example, mice deficient in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA1) have been reported to develop staphylococcal folliculitis (Shapiro et al. 1997). uPA catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which functions as a broad-spectrum serine protease with many functions, including inflammation modulation. The specific role of uPA in the response (immune and non-immune mediated) to bacterial infection has not been defined. The authors speculated that deficiency in uPA may have resulted in alterations of the local microenvironment of the skin, possibly through a general reduction in the activation or availability of cytokine growth factors. This altered microenvironment in turn facilitated bacterial invasion and infection. Botryomycotic lesions have also been seen in mice deficient in linker of activation of T cells (LAT1) (J. M. Ward, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, September 2003). Given that LAT is important in T cell activation (Abass and Lichtman 2003a) and that T cell-deficient nude mice are susceptible to botryomycosis, it is not surprising that mice deficient in LAT would develop a similar condition. Moreover, the identification of botryomycosis in both LAT-deficient and nude mice further strengthens the supposition that T cells are critical in defense against staphylococcal-induced diseases.",

For example, interferon regulatory factor (IRF1)-1 knockout mice were found to have severe granulomatous gastritis (Figure 2, A and B). Examination of tissue sections with silver stains revealed fungal hyphae morphologically consistent with fungi of the class Zygomycetes (Trottier et al. 2000). IRF-1 is a transcriptional activator for interferon systems, and IRF-1 knockouts have reduced T cell receptor (TCR1)\u03b1\u03b2+, CD4-, CD8+ T cells and decreased interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b31)-induced levels of macrophage-inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA. As a result, these mice are deficient in their ability to mount normal Th1 immune responses and they typically mount reciprocal Th2 responses (Lohoff et al. 1997; Taki et al. 1997). Because the normal immune response to fungal infections is a Th1 response, it is likely that this mouse was unable to mount the appropriate Th1 defense against this environmental fungus and instead mounted an ineffective Th2 response. This case exemplifies that targeted mutations in genes encoding effector molecules of specific arms of the immune responses may result in susceptibilities to uncommon opportunists.",

MHV infection usually results in transient and subclinical infections in immunocompetent hosts. In immunodeficient mice, wasting syndromes with characteristic hepatic or intestinal lesions have been described (Percy and Barthold 2001c). Recently, a previously uncommon presentation of MHV infection was reported in IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice. These mice developed depression, variable ascites, and mild diarrhea (France et al. 1999). Necropsy examinations revealed granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis with extensive adhesion formation. Curiously, the parenchymal lesions and syncytia formation commonly seen in MHV infections were uncommon in infected IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice. IFN-\u03b3 exhibits antiviral properties and activates innate immunity and the subsequent development of effector CD8+ T cells; all of these functions are critical to host defense against viral pathogens (Abass and Lichtman 2003b). Thus, it is logical that deficiency in IFN-\u03b3 would render mice more susceptible to viral infections such as MHV. However, why a deficiency in IFN-\u03b3 resulted in an unusual presentation remains unknown. Importantly, investigations of the mechanisms of this unusual presentation may provide new insight to pathogenesis of this disease as well as those of other coronaviral infections, notably feline infectious peritonitis virus infection, which often manifests as peritonitis. This report highlights that diagnostically challenging uncommon presentations of infectious disease can occur in GEM.",

These mice have defects in B cell maturation due to the targeted mutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain-6 (Igh-61) gene. In this case, several 3- to 10-wk-old NOD.Cg-H2H4-Igh-6\u2212/\u2212 mice presented with lethargy, hunched posture, and runting and died (Figure 3A) (Naugler et al. 2001). Wild-type mice and mice heterozygous for the Igh-6 mutation as well as several strains with mutations in other immune effector molecules were unaffected. These colonies historically had endemic MVM and mouse parvovirus (MPV1) infections. Histological examination of tissues from affected knockout mice revealed large intranuclear inclusions in mononuclear cells of the bone marrow and spleen (Figure 3B). Using agent-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR1) assays, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were found to be positive for MVM in all animals and MPV in some animals. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that inclusions contained 20-nm virions that were positive for the nonstructural parvoviral protein NS-1 and the viral protein 2 capsid antigen of MVM (Figure 3B). The clinical disease in affected mice was subsequently linked to anemia and leukopenia, suggesting that the MVM (possibly in conjunction with MPV) had infected hematopoietic progenitor cells in the spleen and bone marrow. In the natural setting, MVM infections are almost universally subclinical, although experimental infections of SCID mice and neonatal mice may result in myelosuppression similar to that seen in the Igh-6 null mice (Lamana et al. 2001; Segovia et al. 1995, 1999, 2003). The finding that NOD.Cg-H2H4-Igh-6\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to clinical disease when infected with MVM suggests that B cell immunity is important in limiting disease due to this agent. However, determination of the exact role of B cells in MVM immunity awaits further investigation.",

Boivin, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, personal communication, September 2003) observed novel helminth infections in C57BL/6;129 mice with targeted mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat61). Mice were found with worms protruding from their anuses and subsequently found to be heavily colonized by pinworms. However, the pinworms were not Syphacia obvelata, the mouse pinworm, but rather were identified as Syphacia muris, the rat pinworm. Examination of other colonies in the facility revealed that rats in two adjacent animal rooms were infected with S. muris, while no other mice in the facility were infected, including knockout mice lacking other immune effector molecules. Stat-6 mediates signal pathways of interleukin (IL1)-3, IL-4, and IL-13, Th2 cytokines that are important in antiparasite defense. Thus, it is likely that this Th2 response was altered in Stat-6 null mice and that they were rendered susceptible to helminth parasites that are primarily specific to another genus of rodents. Curiously, mice with targeted mutations in genes encoding other Th2 effector molecules, including IL-4 receptor alpha (IL4ra), did not become infected with S. muris, highlighting the complexity of this response and the unpredictability of these novel host:pathogen interactions.",

To ascertain whether co-infection by H. hepaticus modulated MHV-G-induced disease, investigators performed experimental studies. Curiously, H. hepaticus infection appeared to reduce the severity of MHV-G-induced lesions during acute infection, but exacerbated some lesions (hepatic and meningitis) at more chronic stages of disease. The authors speculated that because of their common intestinal niche, H. hepaticus may have altered replication kinetics of MHV-G or altered local immune cell infiltration or cytokine environment such that MHV-G-induced disease severity was modulated.",

H. hepaticus was first recognized as a pathogen because it had complicated an ongoing research project. An increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and previously unrecognized chronic active hepatitis were noted in untreated control mice on a large long-term study to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of a chemical compound. Examination of silver-stained sections of liver revealed slender curved to spiral bacteria associated with lesions. A bacterium was subsequently cultivated from the intestinal tract and liver, characterized as a previously unrecognized member of the genus Helicobacter, and named H. hepaticus (Fox et al. 1994). Because the carcinogenic potential of chemical compounds is evaluated by the induction of hepatic tumors, this dramatic increase in hepatic neoplasia associated with H. hepaticus infection invalidated the results of this and other long-term carcinogenesis studies (Hailey et al. 1998; Ward et al. 1994).",

Subsequently, many\u2014including those with targeted mutations in genes encoding IL-10, TCR-\u03b1, \u03b22 microglobulin, intercellular adhesion molecules, transporter associated with antigen processing (MHC1 deficient), and uPA, as well as those heterozygous for mutations in p53\u2014 were found to be colonized by H. hepaticus (Foltz et al. 1998). In some cases, inflammation of the intestinal tract abated or was eliminated when these strains were rendered helicobacter free (Foltz et al. 1998; Kullberg et al. 1998). Moreover, experimental infection of IL-10 and TCR-\u03b1\u03b2 knockout mice with H. hepaticus caused more severe disease, further supporting the role of this bacterium in induction of intestinal inflammation and its potential to confound interpretation of results from inflammatory bowel disease research (Burich et al. 2001; Chin et al. 2000; Kullberg et al. 1998).",

            "text": "Some controversy exists about the role of H. hepaticus in intestinal inflammation. Although many studies have shown that H. hepaticus can initiate intestinal inflammation in a number of GEM, Dieleman and colleagues (2000) found no differences in severity of intestinal inflammation between H. hepaticus-infected and helicobacter-free IL-10-deficient mice. This result was in sharp contrast to the findings of Kullberg and coworkers, who found that H. hepaticus infection exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice (Kullberg et al. 1998). Although there are many plausible explanations for this discrepancy, one possibility is that the flora of these mice differed in comparison with mice used in previous studies. This possibility adds a whole new potential variable to studies of intestinal inflammation that use GEM. Indeed, it is well established that intestinal inflammation of many models is abrogated when these mice are rendered germ free and in some cases specific pathogen free (Chu et al. 2004; Engle et al. 2002; Kado et al. 2001; Schultz et al. 1999; Sellon et al. 1998). Moreover, other animal models of chronic inflammation, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, adjuvant arthritis, and collagen-induced arthritis, are also modified when animals are rendered germ free, suggesting that intestinal flora modulate systemic immunity in addition to mucosal-associated immune responses (Birnbaum et al. 1998; Bjork et al. 1994; Breban et al. 1993; Kohashi et al. 1979, 1986a,b; Taurog et al. 1999; van de Langerijt et al. 1993). Collectively, these observations have prompted some investigators to propose that gnotobiotic (known flora) animals should be used in studies of inflammatory conditions that use GEM. However, the cost of producing and housing these animals, especially when coupled with inherent costs of GEM production and maintenance, often precludes their use. At the very least, the possible role of intestinal flora should be considered in situations where inflammatory phenotypes change unexpectedly or differ among laboratories.",

Thus, it is not surprising that genetic background may also influence microbial-associated phenotypes. This effect was recently exemplified in studies of helicobacter-associated intestinal cancer. In these studies, 129/SvEv Rag2-deficient mice developed more severe H. hepaticus\u2013induced colitis and epithelial dysplasia than Rag-2-deficient BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice (Erdman et al. 2003a). Others have also speculated that background strain may have influenced the type and/or degree of phenotype alterations seen in GEM when infected with pathogens. As described above, Marcotte and colleagues (1996) and Macy and coworkers (2000) described combined P. pneumotropica and P. carinii infections in very similar B cell-deficient GEMs (Igh-6and Igh-J mutations). However, the disease phenotype exhibited by these mutants differed markedly: The Igh-6 null mutants developed exudative alveolitis and suppurative bronchopneumonia, and the Igh-J null mutants developed primarily interstitial pneumonia with minimal evidence of the exudate. Macy and coworkers (2002) speculated that the differing genetic backgrounds of these two mutants (C.B-17 and MRL-Faslpr for the Igh-6 null mutant, and C57BL/6 for the Igh-J null mutant) may have contributed to the differences in disease phenotype.",

To this end, aryl-hydrocarbon (Ahr1) knockout mice on a C57BL/6 mouse background develop an immunodeficiency associated with defective DNA repair that results in chronic skin, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary infections. These mice also develop unexplained cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure (Fernandez-Salguero et al. 1997). Barthold (2002) proposed that the immunodeficiency in these mice led to opportunistic infections that accelerated the onset of multisystemic amyloidosis, normally a late-onset disease in C57BL/6 mice. Renal amyloidosis in turn may have predisposed these mice to coagulopathies and subsequent atrial thrombosis, cardiomegaly, and heart failure. This scenario could also occur in other common background strains that are prone to amyloidosis (i.e., FVB) or atrial thrombosis (i.e., BALB/c) and highlights the complexity with which microbial infections may complicate phenotypes (Barthold 2002).",

H. hepaticus has emerged as a model bacterial organism capable of initiating chronic Th1-mediated inflammation in the intestinal tract and liver. Moreover, through experimental infections, interactions between Helicobacter spp. and GEM strains, including those deficient in Mdr1a, Rag-2 (on a 129/SVEv background), IL-7, NF-\u03bab (p50\u2212/\u2212p65+/\u2212), and TCR-\u03b1, led to the development of new animal models for inflammatory bowel disease (Burich et al. 2001; Chin et al. 2000; Erdman et al. 2001; Kullberg et al. 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003; Maggio-Price et al. 2002; Tomczak et al. 2003; von Freeden-Jeffry et al. 1998) and chronic inflammation-associated intestinal dysplasia/cancer (Erdman et al. 2003a,b).

The virus was identified by representational difference analysis (RDA1) (Lisitsyn 1995; Pastorian et al. 2000) and was ultimately isolated and purified. Experimental inoculations with purified MNV-1 resulted in deaths in mice deficient in Stat1, Stat 1 and protein kinase RNA activated, Stat1 and Rag2, and \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3 receptors of IFN (IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3R). Mice with mutations in a number of other innate immune effector molecules survived infection. Stat1 is involved in signaling through both IFN \u03b1\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 receptors, so collectively these findings implicate Stat1-dependent innate immunity in prevention of lethal MNV-1 infection. This case highlights that unexplained/unexpected disease, death, or changes in phenotype may indicate infections by previously unrecognized microbial agents. The scenario also highlights how aggressive pursuit of novel agents with contemporary molecular tools such as RDA is warranted in situations where phenotypes of GEM have changed. Moreover, this discovery has provided a new and exciting animal model for the study of norovirus biology and disease pathogenesis.",

These studies indicate that many GEM are susceptible or develop novel manifestations of disease when infected with a number of rodent pathogens in addition to the prevalent agents described above. For example, infection of osteopontin and IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice with murine rotavirus demonstrated that rodents are highly susceptible to clinical disease when these genes are mutated (Rollo et al. 2005; Vancott et al. 2003). Moreover, infection of B-cell-deficient muMT (Igh-6) null mice with the once common pathogen Mycoplasma pulmonis results in arthritis or periarticular changes that resemble disease seen in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Berglof et al. 1997). Does the lack of reports of naturally occurring rotavirus or M. pulmonis-induced diseases in GEM reflect the low prevalence of these agents or experimental phenomena that are not recapitulated in the natural setting? It is likely that both factors (and others) may be involved, but these examples highlight that microbial agents have much greater potential to affect GEM phenotypes than has been recognized to date.",

There is great variety in health surveillance programs; no two designs are identical, and the program design should cater to the needs of the institution.

In contrast, immunodeficient mice may develop persistent chronic infections (Percy and Barthold 2001c). Likewise, two recent reports highlight that MHV may persist in some genetically engineered strains, including B6.129S1-Tnftm1Ljo (tumor necrosis factor-deficient) and transgenic strains expressing a rearranged T-cell receptor \u03b2 chain (Pullium et al. 2003; Rehg et al. 2001). Importantly and unlike immunodeficient SCID and nude mice, these mice did not show clinical signs. In both cases, infections were successfully detected using sentinel monitoring programs.

Because these systems isolate individual cages, they may minimize spread of infections (the \u201cpro\u2019) but also result in inefficient detection of infections by sentinel monitoring programs (the \u201ccon\u201d). For example, in experimental studies assessing monitoring programs for ventilated systems, one strain of MPV was ineffectively transmitted to soiled bedding sentinels, in part due to a dilutional effect (Compton et al. 2004b). This dilutional effect could readily occur in a natural setting (i.e., via accidental introduction of a single GEM that is persistently colonized by a microbial pathogen) and result in ineffective detection of infections. Fortunately, new tools are being developed to monitor these systems, including the use of exhaust air sentinels, screening of filtered exhaust air using molecular diagnostic tools, and combinations of these methods with more traditional sentinel-based methods.
