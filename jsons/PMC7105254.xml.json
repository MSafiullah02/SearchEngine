Pandemics evolve rapidly, and are complex and unpredictable. In 2004, after the SARS experience, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the essential and desirable features of pandemic plans, which included: (i) preparation for surveillance; (ii) investigation of cases; (iii) treatment modalities; (iv) prevention of community spread; (v) maintenance of essential services; (vi) research and evaluation, and implementation; and (vii) testing and revision of the plan.1 This paper will critique the current literature with respect to contemporary challenges for pandemic influenza prevention, control and treatment.",

Influenza A subtypes are named according to which subtypes of H and N they possess.

If a pandemic is defined merely by the spread of a new influenza virus strain around the world, the effects of having the formal declaration in place may disproportionately affect the function of society in the event of a mild illness. Criteria also need to be developed for declaring a pandemic \u2018over\u2019. In the case of Pandemic H1N1 2009, countries around the world ceased epidemiological tracking of the infection when it became ubiquitous. Thus there is a need to establish international consensus on the formal definition and criteria for pandemic influenza to allow appropriate response to an outbreak, and to determine when declarations of pandemic may be lifted.",

It addressed local community empowerment, recommending planning with community leaders and groups. Social distancing was identified as an important prevention strategy.

These plans aimed for staff protection, including priority vaccination for at-risk staff, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, the use of personal protective equipment and access to pandemic stockpiles, with those exposed or ill expected to self-isolate.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Other identified needs include extra funding, pre-defined triggers for plan implementation and deactivation, anticipatory training of key personnel29 and suspension of non-essential and/or non-emergency hospital functions during the crisis.14 Ventilators, medications and personal protective equipment were to be stockpiled. Increased cleaning, security and crowd management capacity was identified in the plans, along with the need to increase morgue and laboratory capacity. More non-medical staff are required for administration, communication, transportation, security, cleaning and garbage disposal, and for crowd control. Surge capacity applies across the entire community, with health, government and community groups required to act cooperatively. When individual hospitals reach capacity they need to have means to move patients and/or services to other hospitals or centres.29, 30, 31 Healthcare worker illness needs to be planned for with use of agency, retired staff, and volunteers.14 Seasonal influenza seasons have highlighted a lack of surge capacity in emergency departments (EDs).32 The literature shows that pandemic planning and management are complex, expensive and difficult.",

At the commencement of the 2009 pandemic, health department officials advised people with ILI to present to their local ED45 causing overwhelming presentations by those with ILI and those fearful they may have had contact.34, 46, 47 In a pandemic, general practitioner and hospital waiting rooms are a potential site for cross infection to already unwell people if people present with a highly infectious illness. This happened during the SARS outbreak in Canada in 2003.48 The literature indicates that these patients are best treated in other sites. Overcrowded living conditions contribute to rapid influenza spread.16 This contributed to the disproportionately high impact of Pandemic H1N1 Influenza 2009 in indigenous communities in the Northern Territory.49 School closures have been used as a means of social distancing. However a Western Australian survey of parents whose children were in schools closed during the H1N1 influenza 2009 pandemic50 revealing that 74% of these students participated in out of home activities including sporting events, shopping, outdoor recreation and parties while their schools were closed. This paper questions the efficacy of school closure in preventing infection spread, highlighting that students were congregating elsewhere.",

Prior to the outbreak, the ship procedures already included point-of-care testing, antiviral medication and isolation for ILI patients. However, not all ill passengers sought medical care, presumably because they had mild illness or were unwilling to be isolated while holidaying. After disembarkation, passengers discovered their need to be quarantined via media reports, word of mouth, from ship staff or public heath staff. Almost all complied with quarantine requirements, and only one case of infection passed from a passenger to another person was found, with no further community spread. Thus, an epidemic on board ships was prevented from contributing to the 2009 Pandemic.",

Additionally, droplet precautions add patient isolation or cohorting and minimising patient transfers. Particulate respirators, eye protection, and impervious gowns and gloves, are advised for all aerosol-generating procedures, which should be performed in a negative pressure room if available.7, 41, 58, 59 Australian guidelines recommend surgical masks for those entering an infectious area, coming within 1 m57 or 2 m7 of an infectious patient. Where tolerated, masking the patient is more effective than masking the health care workers.60 Personal protective equipment is vital to healthcare workers who cannot be protected in any other way prior to effective vaccine development. In 2009, slow distribution of personal protective equipment from the national stockpile to frontline workers was a problem, with general practitoner practices running out of stock and being unable to replace it early in the pandemic.35\n",

While the disease itself was less virulent than expected, it confirmed the unpredictability of pandemic influenza, and its ability to cause significant impacts on health systems and the community. The H1N1 influenza 2009 pandemic highlighted unresolved challenges identified in both Exercise Cumpston 06 and Exercise Sustain 08, which we as a profession and society must address. Public health challenges include developing means of increasing acceptance of influenza vaccination by both the general public and healthcare workers, provision of targeted education for the indigenous population and other at-risk groups, improving public knowledge of social distancing and personal hygiene measures in the prevention of transmission, and improving dissemination of information during a pandemic, especially via the media. We can use the evidence to refine pandemic plans and promote community well-being during an influenza pandemic.",
