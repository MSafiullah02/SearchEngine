However, when acute bacterial infections occur, and caused by respiratory pathogens (Table 5.1\n), rhinosinusitis may be associated with important head and intracranial complications (Table 5.2\n). Oral corticosteroids combined with antibiotic may be associated with modest benefit for short-term relief of symptoms in adults with severe acute sinusitis.2\n",

There are also noninfectious causes of pharyngitis that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of \u201csore throat\u201d syndromes. Pharyngitis may be part of the common cold and this is considered one of the most common reasons for outpatient medical consultation. Acute pharyngitis in adults is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes in 5\u20139% of cases with a similar number of cases in adolescents and young adults caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Acute pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes is always important to suspect when an individual reports with tonsillopharyngeal exudate, tender anterior cervical lymphadenitis, and fever greater than 100.4; absence of cough and coryza (ie, Centor criteria) make the possibility of group A streptococci infection likely; particularly if this occurs during winter and early spring and when it involves school-age children. Confirmation of streptococci through antigen testing and culture is recommended. Treating group A streptococci pharyngeal infection improves symptoms, prevent further transmission, prevents rheumatic fever, and probably prevent local and systemic spread of disease.\n",

Bronchorrhea can also be associated with lung metastases form adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, or other glands. Nonmalignant conditions include endobronchial tuberculosis, and asthma.
