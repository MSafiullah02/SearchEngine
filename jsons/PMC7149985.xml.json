Even though the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs has been the one most effective factor in the reduction of human rabies, the number of human deaths worldwide is greater than that of the combined deaths from polio, meningococcal meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenze (bird flu) (Wilde et al., 2005). We have the \u2018tools\u2019 available to us in highly efficacious and safe animal and human vaccines. Multiple factors, discussed elsewhere in this book, can, however, prevent their use effectively in many areas of the world.",

            "text": "In his quest for a means to prevent rabies in humans, Louis Pasteur initiated research into animal rabies vaccine in France in the early 1880s (Bunn, 1991). Virus obtained from a rabid dog was first serially passed in rabbits by intracerebral inoculation at specified time intervals. Dogs were then vaccinated at various time intervals and challenged with rabies virus. Although this method produced acceptable results, Pasteur found that by serial intracerebral inoculation of monkeys with the dog origin virus, the incubation period increased while the virulence of the virus decreased. By using this regimen, Pasteur demonstrated that dogs vaccinated were resistant to subsequent challenge with virulent street (non-laboratory propagated) rabies virus.",

In a review by Friedberger and Frohner (1904), it was reported that Hogyes and Protopopoff and others conducted further studies to improve on the safety and efficacy of vaccines for dogs and to reduce the number of doses needed. In 1927, the First International Rabies Conference recommended that fixed virus for canine rabies vaccines be completely inactivated or attenuated so that they caused no disease in dogs vaccinated either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) (Schoenig, 1930). For the next several decades, virtually all rabies nerve tissue origin (NTO) vaccines were inactivated with phenol using the method described by Semple (Bunn, 1991). The NTO vaccines currently in use for mass vaccination campaigns in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean are primarily produced from rabies virus-infected suckling mouse brains or lamb brains. These vaccines have been shown to be effective in campaigns (WHO, 2004). However, NTO killed vaccines for dogs and other animals have often, in the past, resulted in post-vaccinal nervous system reactions that could result in the death of the vaccinated animals (Bunn, 1991). Better vaccines were needed.",

The virus was initially passed 136 times in 1 -day-old chicks. Vaccine produced from the 40th to the 50th chicken embryo passage lost its viscerotropic properties but retained some neurotropic properties. This was designated as Flury low-egg passage (LEP). While effective in dogs, the vaccine occasionally caused rabies in young pups, cats and cattle (Bunn, 1991). To increase the safety of the vaccines in these species, Koprowski et al. (1954) increased the passages of the Flury strain in embryonated eggs until the virus was found to be non-pathogenic for dogs when inoculated intracerebrally following the 205th passage. This Flury high-egg passage (HEP) vaccine was declared safe for IM use in cats and cattle as well as puppies 3 months of age. However, since cases of vaccine-induced rabies occurred in cats administered IM with the Flury-HEP vaccine, it was later withdrawn from the market (Cabasso et al., 1963; Dean and Guevin, 1963).",

Tissue culture (TC) vaccines, such as those derived with the Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) strain, which was adapted to hamster kidney cells (Fenji, 1960) and the Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) strain, are grown on porcine kidney cells (Abelseth, 1963) and are commonly used to produce MLV vaccines (Reculard, 1996). Several other MLV vaccines have been produced over the years. These MLV vaccines, especially those using the CEO, SAD and ERA strains are still used extensively in Asia and Africa and parts of Europe and have been adapted for oral immunization of carnivores, including domestic dogs and cats (Blancou and Meslin, 1996). The TC MLV vaccines produce fewer allergic reactions than the CEO vaccines. Potency tests for MLV vaccines for animal use consist of measuring the titer of infectious virus in a sample from each filling lot (see Section 2.6.1). If the titer is as high as that proved efficacious in the species of animal for which the vaccine is intended, the vaccine is released for use (Sizaret, 1996).",

            "text": "The concept of oral rabies vaccines (ORV) was first proven to be successful in 1969 (Baer et al., 1971). Using the SAD Berne strain of virus adapted from the ERA strain, several types of MLV ORV vaccines have been produced for use in baits for free-ranging animals that serve as vectors for the maintenance and transmission of the disease in wildlife species (Rupprecht et al., 2004). ORV have been used extensively in Europe since 1977 and in Canada from 1989 with considerable success (Isara et al., 1990; Aubert et al., 1994). Unfortunately, the live-virus SAD vaccines contained some degree of residual pathogenicity for wild rodents (Artois et al., 1992) and resulted in partially impaired immune responses in fox cubs <8 weeks old born from SAD B19\u2013vaccinated vixens, resulting in insufficient protection against rabies (Muller et al., 2001). Since the early to mid-1990s, the SAD strain used in vaccine has been replaced by the SAG-1 and SAG-2 (SAD-Avirulent-Gif) strains in the development of vaccines. The SAG-2 strain, the strain of choice, is a double mutant isolated from the SAD Berne strain after two successive selection steps utilizing anti-glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies. This strain is avirulent following intracerebral inoculation of immunocompetent mice and protects the mice against challenge with challenge virus standard (CVS) (Lafay et al., 1994). The SAG-2 strain of rabies virus, packaged in chicken-head baits, has successfully protected captive African wild dogs against rabies challenge (Knobel et al., 2003). In studies conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the SAG-2 vaccine produced no clinical illness in laboratory vaccinates (beagles) and residual SAG-2 virus was isolated from only one of 57 oral swabs from the dogs (Fekadu, et al., 1996; Orciari et al., 2001). No ORV derived from SAD/SAG origin vaccines are currently licensed for use in the USA (Compendium, 2006).",

Initial studies of this new ORV were conducted to determine whether the V-RG recombinant virus vaccine satisfied the various criteria that had to be met for such a vaccine to be distributed in the wild (Kieny et al., 1984; Wiktor et al., 1984). Criteria included: the vaccine would be effective when delivered by an oral bait; the baits would be readily accepted by target species but would be rabies virus-free; the vaccine in the baits would have reasonably long-term genetic and thermal stability; the vaccine would be biologically contained in the host; oral exposure to baits with the vaccine would produce full protection against rabies virus challenge; that no non-target species would develop rabies if they ingested the baits; and that the baits were clearly identified and safe for contact with humans. In an extensive series of trials carried out in the USA and in France, these criteria were met and the vaccine was licensed in 1995 for raccoons to prevent spread of raccoon rabies (and later to prevent the spread of Mexican dog rabies to Texas coyotes along the south Texas border with Mexico) by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Wiktor et al., 1985; Rupprecht et al., 1986; Brochier et al., 1990, 1991, 1995; Desmettre et al., 1990). The single licensed product is produced only by Merial, Inc., Athens, GA, USA as Raboral V-RG\u2122 for use by governmental (State Public Health) agencies as an ORV for raccoons and coyotes.",

This was necessitated because of the poor performance of the initial manufactured tissue culture origin vaccines (Bunn, 1991). Although a number of other tests to measure vaccine potency are used throughout the world, the NIH test is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for measuring the ability of an inactivated vaccine to protect a mouse against virus challenge. The NIH test relies on challenge exposure of immunized mice to one virus strain (CVS), a strain thought to be derived from the original Pasteur isolate (Baer, 1997). This test has some inherent bias towards vaccine from the same virus strain origin when comparing vaccine efficacy across the variety of strains (i.e. SAD, Flury strain vaccines) used to prepare vaccines (Barth et al., 1988), but this bias does not occur when non-Pasteur stain vaccines are tested for protective potential against wild virus strains (Baer, 1997; Wunderli et al., 2003a). In addition, the NIH uses two doses of vaccine administered at a one-week interval by an intraperitoneal challenge two weeks later. This vaccination route is quite different from that used for routine administration of rabies vaccine. The second dose prevents an evaluation of the vaccine's primary immunologic potential and the challenge results in a disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing neutralizing antibodies in the serum to prevent infection. As a result of these limitations, the WHO has acknowledged that the NIH test needs some improvements or further suggesting that a new rabies potency test may be needed (WHO, 1992, 1994). Two recent reports have proposed an alternative method that avoids these shortcomings (Wunderli et al., 2003a, 2003b).",

            "text": "Due to the higher antigenic mass and the use of adjuvants, inactivated rabies vaccines have produced post-vaccinal local and systemic reactions. The most common non-neurologic reactions include soreness, lameness and regional lymphadenopathy in the injected limb. Fever and anaphylaxis have also been reported (Dreesen, 1999; Greene and Rupprecht, 2006). Focal vasculitis and granulomas have been seen 3\u20136 months after vaccination (Greene and Rupprecht, 2006). Post-vaccinal sarcomas may develop as a result of sustained inflammatory reactions at the site of the vaccination that involve the underlying dermas. Such post-vaccinal sarcomas are often aggressive and invasive, especially in cats, months to years following vaccination (Dubielzig et al., 1993; Kass et al., 1993; Greene and Rupprecht, 2006). A review of 239 cases of fibrosarcomas in cats following single vaccination showed that 37% of the cats with vaccination-site tumors had received rabies vaccine, 33% were administered a non-rabies combination vaccine and 30% received a feline leukemia vaccine (Hendrick et al., 1994). It is not unusual for palpable lesions to occur in cats administered killed vaccine subcutaneously (Schulze et al., 1997). Adverse incidence rates for reactions to rabies vaccination in a retrospective study of 3587 ferrets was 1% when the rabies vaccine was given alone and 0.85% when given in combination with distemper vaccine. The most common adverse events were vomiting and diarrhea (Moore et al., 2005). The new generation of vectored recombinant vaccines now appearing on the market, such as the avipoxvirus vaccine recently licensed for use for cats in the USA (a rabies glycoprotein, live canarypox vectored vaccine) appears to produce few, if any, allergic or neoplastic reactions (Greene and Dreesen, 1998; Greene and Rupprecht, 2006).",

Two inactivated vaccines are combined with other biologics for use in horses. In 2000, a new generation of vaccines was licensed for use in cats. These are the live canarypox-rabies virus glycoprotein recombinant vectored vaccines, either monovalent (one licensed vaccine) or in combination with feline panleukopenia virus, feline parvovirus and feline calicivirus vaccines (Compendium, 2006). A live vaccinia-rabies virus glycoprotein recombinant vectored vaccine is licensed for restricted use in wildlife raccoons and coyotes. As stated earlier, there are no MLV (attenuated) rabies vaccines licensed for use in the USA. All currently licensed killed rabies vaccines intended for use in carnivores must protect 22 of 25 or 26 of 30 (or a statistically equivalent number) animals from an IM challenge with a rabies virus for 90 days post challenge and 80% of controls must die from the challenge (Code of Federal Regulations, 2004). Alternative challenge requirements have been outlined when the test animals are of a species other than carnivores (Code of Federal Regulations, 2004).

This was apparent during the recent raccoon rabies epidemic in the Middle Atlantic and northeastern USA (Krebs et al., 1997; Hanlon and Rupprecht, 1998). The increase in rabies cases in cats, while dog rabies cases remained substantially unchanged, reflects the vaccine status of the two populations as well as the number of feral animals in the two populations (Eng et al., 1988; Petronek, 1998; Dreesen, 1999). Of 54 respondents in a survey of state and community health officials by Johnson and Walden (1996), 74% stated that canine rabies vaccination was required by state law while only 52% stated that cat vaccination was state law. The need for cat vaccination and feral population control cannot be overemphasized (Dreesen, 1999). Johnson and Walden's survey (1996) also noted that over-the-counter sales of rabies vaccines was permitted in 22 states and that, at that time, vaccination of wolf-hybrids was permitted in 14 states; however, in all but two of these 14 states the owner must sign a liability statement. Fourteen other states did not address the wolf-hybrid issue at all.",

At least one well-documented case of rabies has occurred in a properly vaccinated wolf-hybrid (Jay et al., 1994). This animal was vaccinated with a 3-year vaccine at 4 months of age and received other vaccines and bacterins and an antihelminthic on the same day. Six months later the animal was found with a dead skunk in its mouth. Within 3 weeks the animal developed signs suggestive of rabies, was euthanized and rabies was confirmed in the laboratory. Currently, there are no licensed rabies vaccines for wolf-hybrids and the 2006 Compendium states that wild animals and hybrids (offspring of wild animals crossbred to domestic animals) should not be kept as pets.",

If not euthanized, the animal should be placed in strict quarantine for 6 months and vaccinated either upon entry into isolation or one month prior to release. Animals with expired vaccinations should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Currently, vaccinated dogs, cats and ferrets should be revaccinated immediately following exposure and kept under control and observation for 45 days. It has been shown that there is some evidence that the use of vaccine alone will not reliably prevent rabies from occurring in an unvaccinated domestic animal (Hanlon et al., 2002). Vaccinated livestock exposed to rabies should be revaccinated and observed for 45 days (Compendium, 2006). If not previously vaccinated, food animals should be slaughtered within 7 days with disposal of tissues in the exposed area. If not slaughtered within this time period, the animal should be closely observed for 6 months.",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, the Compendium (2006) is issued as recommendations only. Some states do not strictly adhere to the recommendations. For example, the Texas Health and Safety Code originally followed the previously noted recommendations for animals exposed to rabies (Clark and Wilson, 1996). However, in 1988, the Code was amended; unvaccinated domestic animals exposed to a rabid animal were to be euthanized or vaccinated immediately after exposure, kept in isolation for 90 days and given booster vaccinations in the third and eighth week of isolation. This regimen was based loosely on recommendations for humans exposed to rabies virus. A retrospective study conducted by Clark and Wilson (1996) found that 99.7% of 713 unvaccinated animals did not develop rabies during the 1979\u20131987 period during which the recommendations of the NASPHV were followed. Two PEP failures did occur (0.3%). For the period 1988\u20131994, after the Texas Code was amended to allow PEP for unvaccinated animals exposed to rabies, 629 of 632 animals (99.5%) that received the PEP booster vaccinations did not die of rabies. There was no statistical difference between the two regimens under conditions followed in Texas. In a follow-up study for the years 1995\u20131998, Wilson and Clark (2001) found only four of 830 (0.5%) domestic animals that received the PEP protocol, as recommended, during the previous 7-year period developed clinical rabies. They concluded that this is an effective PEP protocol and \u2018has been proven to be effective for the control of rabies in animals\u2019. This alternative method of PEP for unvaccinated domestic animals exposed to rabies, as practiced in Texas, has not been endorsed in the Compendium (2006).",
