The objectives of our study were to investigate numerous characters simultaneously in a considerable group of species; to quantify the relations shown among the species, using objective methods; and to indicate these relationships. The organisms selected as an example for use in this study are solitary bees in the family Megachilidae. This choice was made because one of us (C. D. M.) has made recent systematic studies of these insects, so that conclusions as to the relationships obtained by usual systematic procedures could be compared 1 Contribution number 936 from the Department of Entomology, University of Kansas, Lawrence.

The more numerous are the differentiating characters associated within each group, the more confident is he of the conclusion. Even though they may be minute and inconspicuous, the systematist will weight such characters heavily in comparison with those which vary from species to species with no obvious relation to one another. His judgments as to relationships, and hence higher categories, will therefore be largely based upon a few characters which he finds to be perfectly associated. Especially if the number of such characters is small, the discovery of additional character associations may alter judgment about relationships. Sometimes, as a result of parallel evolution, two or more sets of associated characters may suggest different relationships. In this case the systematist must decide, on the basis of experienced judgment or mere intuition, which set of characters indicates phyletic relationships. In brief, he will give greater weight to the characters that he believes most significant. .",

Thus, among a group of species, several may have independently invaded a particular habitat and independently evolved the same adaptive character. This situation becomes obvious if conservative characters are found which show the true phylogeny. On the other hand, it is often evident that obviously adaptive features do characterize large groups of species and hence do indicate phyletic relationships. It is also probable that every character, if not itself adaptive, is at least determined by genes which have adaptive value through some other influence. For these reasons we cannot use adaptiveness, even if there were a way to measure it, as a criterion for weighting.",

By using a large number of characters and species, however, we believe that weighting becomes unnecessary because the magnitude of correlation coefficients calculated between species would be little affected except by extreme weighting.",

We have used external adult characters because they are the only.ones known for most of the species concerned.

It is our basic assumption that degree of difference can give an estimate of evolutionary divergence (E). E is clearly the product of r X t, where r is the rate of evolution (dE/dt) and t is time. From an estimate of E, there is no way to obtain r or t; it is, for example, quite probable that one pair of species diverged quite recently compared to another equally different pair.",

The amount of evolution, after divergence from a common stem, of two forms that have evolved in a parallel manner, would be underestimated by our method, as well as by customary systematic methods. In the majority of cases in animals, however, parallelisms probably involve only a few characters. Thus in a study of parallelisms in satumiid moths (Michener, 1949a) many structures were found to appear or disappear independently in various genera but in no instance did a large group of associated characters behave in this fashion. Among the bees used in the present study there is evidence of acquisition of clear wings, red integumental pigment and abundant pale pubescence by various unrelated species in desert areas. These tendencies could affect a maximum of only five of the 122 characters studied. We believe that much of the difficulty due to parallelisms is eliminated in our study by the large number of characters used.

For our purposes, however, correlations between species based on the characters studied, seems a more useful method. In so far as the characters used are indicative of the entire spectrum of potential variation of the species, we can say that the resulting correlation coefficient is representative of the real affinity between two species. When scanned for clusters of high correlation coefficients, the Q-type matrix (i.e., tabulation of species against species showing correlation coefficients of each species with all of the others) reveals species which are similar. It is thus especially suited to classificatory problems.

The correlation coefficients were grouped into 22 classes with class intervals of .05. The frequency distribution can be read from the right hand column of table 3. The modal class has a class mark of .38; this represents the most frequent class of correlation coefficients found between species in this study. However there is a second mode at r = .78. This bimodality would indicate that we are dealing with two populations of correlation coefficients: Those indicating close, possibly intrageneric relations and others representing more distant relations. That this is so can be verified from a two-way frequency distribution of the formal classification against the correlation coefficients, shown in the body of ferences between the two.

In a systematic hierarchic classification, however, groups at the same level have to be mutually exclusive for practical as well as for theoretical reasons, except for low level groups exhibiting reticulate evolutionary patterns (rare above the species level in animals). A further reason for the unsuitability of cluster analysis is the complexity of the clusters as more species are added to them. Although clusters are therefore not convenient in an initial search for structure, the diagram of relationships established by methods to be described below could be easily recognized in the clusters outlined by cluster analysis. A method essentially similar to cluster analysis is the p-group and pFgroup method of Olson and Miller (1951) applied to three paleontological Rstechnique matrices.

Then a new matrix of correlation coefficients, based on the groups as well as isolated species which had failed to enter any group, was calculated. Then by the same method, it was possible to unite these into larger groups (sometimes subgenera) , and these into still larger or higher groups, etc. Thus it has been possible to develop a hierarchy of groups which is represented below by means of diagrams of relationships (figs. 5-8) for comparison with figures 1 and 2.",

Thus a method using groups of various sizes, called a variable group method, was selected as more reasonable and practical than the pair group method. A second consideration was how to weight the variables (species or groups) on calculating a new correlation matrix following each grouping procedure. If A and B represent closely related species, C a more distant species, the problem is, should a still more distant species, D, be placed in relation to a homogeneous group ABC or in relation to the AB-C stem of a diagram of relationships? The latter alternative was selected, so that not all species have the same weight in constructing the diagrams of relationships. We therefore termed our technique the \"weighted variable group method.\" The greater part of another paper (Sokal and Michener, 1957) is devoted to a detailed explanation of this method so that others can readily follow it.",

There are several instances (listed in item 9 above) of groups not or but little subdivided in figures 1 and 2 which now show more structure; that is, we now have evidence of the varying degrees of relationship among the species of the groups. In part this is merely due to the fact that in the original diagram no effort was made to show relationships below the level of species group. In M onumetha the relationships shown in figure 9 are the same as those that would have been suggested had a \"tree\" for the species of this group been attempted before the statistical study. In the other groups, usual systematic methods did not provide the worker (C.D.M.) with the bases for attempting diagrams of relationships. Certain species (e.g., 67, 68) were known to be closely related, so that it is not true that these groups were \"structureless\" in the eyes of the systematist, but it was not obvious how the pairs and little groups of very similar species, together with the more isolated species, were related. It is also true that the three groups recognized in Ashmeadiella s. str. (fig. 2) were very informal and the failure of the statistical method to support them is not surprising to C.D.M. In short, the diagrams for the groups listed in item 9 above, except for certain matters in Eremosmia discussed later, seem satisfactory and shed new light on some of the relationships. The same may be said also of the relationships between the subgenera Dasyosmia, Andronicus, M onumetha, Alcidamea, and Cyrtosmia (item 5 of above list), shown as equally related in figure 2. Figure 6 provides an idea of the relationships of these groups which seems acceptable to C.D.M. The most striking fact here is the isolated position of Dasyosmia. The new location of the dividing line between Proteriades and H oplitis (item 4, above list) is not at all 'surprising. The old diagram of relationships ( fig. 1) shows Proteriades as a mere offshoot of H oplitis, having close relationships (pointed out by Hurd and Michener, 1955) to Hoplitina and Acrosmia, which were placed as subgenera of H oplitis. Proteriades was separated as a rather large group having specialized hairs on the galeae and labial palpi for extracting pollen from the slender flowers of Cryptantha. This was a striking and convenient character and was correlated with some others, but the discovery of males of 17 and 18, which nearly or entirely lack such hairs, already weakened it.",

            "text": "quantitative ways of solving this dilemma may exist for particular species. An array of species most closely related to a given isolated species can be listed in order of decreasing magnitude of their correlation coefficients with that species. The \"base line\" relating these relatives to each other can be read off figures 5 to 8 as the highest horizontal line connecting the species concerned. Clearly, as more species are admitted to the group of relatives the base line level is bound to decrease. The original level of the base line, the presence or absence of a decrease and its magnitude appear to reveal phylogenetic relationships of the isolated species. For purposes of analysis we have chosen an arbitrary number of 12 nearest relatives for each of 16 isolated species and listed them in decreasing order of correlation with the isolated species in table 4. Line 1 for each isolated species identifies the code numbers of the most closely related species while line 2 gives the value of the correlation coefficient of the relative with the isolated species concerned. Line 3 shows the level of the base line for the group of relatives up to and including the species listed in line 1. Thus in the case of species 4 the base line for species 2 and 6, its closest relatives, is .85 and remains at that level upon addition of the next ten relatives (species 8, 14, 15, ... 7). 100 Figures 10 and 11 show the levels of the base lines of table 4 in graphic form. On careful study the lines fall into a number of more or less definite types. Type I, as exemplified by species 1, 31 and 97 and group 43-44, includes species whose nearest relatives are themselves a closely knit group, while more distant relatives (among the 12 studied) are still fairly highly related. Species 1, for example, is clearly closer to the 2-16 group (of fig.  5 ) than it is to group 17-18. There is, Isolated species 1, 4, etc., shown as pregroup species in figure 5 , are now shown as exgroup derivatives of various stems. Numbers inserted in the lines leading to these species indicate the levels, in terms of the scale at the left, at which the lines for these species joined their relatives in figure 5. These numbers therefore give an indication of the unusually large amount of specialization that has occurred in these species. however, no evidence linking it to either 2-3 or 5-16 in preference to the other group. While the previous study had shown that 2-16 and 17-18 were much closer to each other than they were to 1, and consequently species 1 had been depicted as isolated, the present findings indicate that 1 has closer affinities to the 2-16 stem than to the 17-18 stem. This suggests that species 1 is a greatly modified offshoot from the 2-16 stem. In relation to species 1 the pregroup-exgroup terminology is not too appropriate. Species 1 is pregroup to groups 2-3 and 5-16, but exgroup to 2-16. As long as the correct relations are depicted, however, the terminology is secondary; moreover all intermediates must exist between pregroup and exgroup species. Reasoning similar to that employed in the case of species 1 leads us to regard species 31 as a modified offshoot of the 25-27 stem, species 97 as derived from stem 88-94, and group 43-44 as derived from stem 47-48, possibly from species 42.",

It is regrettable but true that the present system of nomenclature cannot easily meet both purposes. Moreover even in purpose (1) the present nomenclatorial system cannot always show both common descent and evolutionary divergence. Thus, referring to figure 9, it will be found difficult to devise a nomenclature to differentiate situations A and B. If we call both A and B genera, for example, then 'we reveal nothing of the different origin of X in the two diagrams. On the other hand calling 1-4 and X separate genera in A but the same genus in B implies that X is closer to 1-4 in B than it is in A, which is true from the viewpoint of time of divergence, but not from that of evolutionary change.",

For example, he would prefer for the sake of convenience, that the size of groups recognized be more or less inversely proportional to the degree of difference between them. He is joined in these views by many present day systematists whose position might be summarized in the words of Mayr, Linsley and Usinger (1953, p. 48) : \"A genus is a systematic category including one species or a group of species of presumably common phylogenetic origin, which is separated from other similar units by a decided gap. It is suggested for practical reasons that the size of the gap be in inverse ratio to the size of the unit. The latter qualification will prevent the recognition of unjustified monotypic genera.\" Thus while Proteriades (species Dasyosmia (species 29-30), which is equally different from the other genera, was not accorded generic rank. On the other hand, R. R. S. would like to see uniform and objective standards applied to the recognition of categories. Not being a practicing taxonomist he would prefer that the classification reflect the quantified relationships rather than considerations of convenience. R. R. S. feels that the only method that even approximates a realistic description of relationships is a pictorial one and that the hierarchy of categories can try to indicate either .descent or amount of divergence (or relationship) between stems, but not both. He maintains that in the example cited above the nomenclature reflects descent in one case (by including Dasyosmia in the genus H oplitis) but indicates divergence in another case (calling Pro-teriades, which also descended from H oplitis, a separate genus). Rather than use categories in this ambiguous manner he would prefer to utilize them to show divergence or relationships only, leaving the description of descent to diagrammatic representation. He would therefore urge both \"lumping\" and \"splitting\" wherever indicated by the variable group analysis, i.e., he has no a priori objections to either monotypic or inordinately large genera or subgenera.",

A consideration of certain species pairs gives some idea of the reliability of the information on levels of the forks found in figures 5 to 8. Species 67 and 68 are shown as correlated to a high degree (.96), while species 63 and 64 are less correlated (.91). A study of the actual differences shows that the principal reason for the lower correlation of the latter pair is that one of them has both the femora and the abdomen largely red, the other has these parts black. Thus in two characters, each having four states, these species fall at opposite extremes. Therefore their correlation coefficient was appreciably lowered. Probably the coloration of the femora and of the abdomen are causally correlated in 63 and 64, so that they ought to have been treated as a single character for this species pair, although this is obviously not so elsewhere in Ashmeadiella where forms with red femora and black abdomens, and with black femora and red abdomens, are well known. In any event, 63 and 64 are actually very similar and may not be specifically distinct. This shows that at the higher levels in the tree more characters are needed (whenever they can be found) to make the levels of forks more reliable. There were only five characters showing any difference in states between 63 and 64 and seven between 67 and 68. Also it shows that base levels as different as .91 and .96 may not be significant bio-logically even though they are statistically. These species pairs were selected for comment because the information regarding them in figure 8 seemed to C. D. M. contrary to his impressions as to relationships. Other similar pairs in our diagrams agreed better with his views. At lower levels in the tree we believe that smaller differences in correlation coefficients (levels of forks) are more significant biologically because of the much larger number of differentiating characters involved.",

Thus if he is studying relationships in a species group, most of the characters are constant and he has only to consider the few that he can find varying among the species. If he is studying generic relations, he ignores characters constant within the subfamily and also, to a considerable degree, those variable within genera, considering only those varying among the genera. Obviously systematists can do good work by their method; we do believe, however, that a method considering the totality of relationships, using all characters, has advantages.
