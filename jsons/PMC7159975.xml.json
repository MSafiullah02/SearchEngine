It is essential for the clinician to know and implement personal safety procedures before starting the examination. In particular, the physician performing the ultrasound must wear appropriate PPE. In case of a COVID-19 + patient with respiratory symptoms, these items are a surgical mask, gloves, a waterproof gown, and goggles or a visor; in the case of high risk of exposure to aerosols (patients subjected to continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation), the use of a FFP2/3 mask, a double pair of gloves, goggles or a visor and boots is recommended. Ultrasound machine and probes must be disinfected with alcohol-based disinfectants before and after ultrasound, and thus equipped with disposable protective materials (probe cover).",

It can thus, together with clinical-laboratory data, prompt therapeutic modifications.
