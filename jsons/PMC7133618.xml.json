One example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-movement restaurant chain, which in a Facebook announcement on Jan 28, 2020, said it would only serve English or Cantonese-speaking but not Mandarin-speaking customers as a public health measure.2 The Facebook post garnered the third most supportive reactions and interactions since the Facebook page's inception in September, 2019.",

            "text": "This anti-Chinese sentiment can be traced back to the general public's discontent with the Hong Kong Government's declining autonomy due to Beijing tightening up its control over the territory, and it was exacerbated by the government's delayed public health response, which fell behind Macau, the other SAR of China, in handling the 2019-nCoV crisis.4 As a result, some of the public health precautionary strategies are self-initiated by the community in attempts to influence the government's policies; for instance, health-care staff held a strike to press for a total border closure, which the government was reluctant to endorse. However, we should be cautious about the possibility that public health measures, however well intended, can be tainted by sentiment that is fuelled with prejudice against a certain group of people. If left unexamined, this sentiment could give rise to measures that do not target the real issue accurately and adequately, undermining the effectiveness of any interventions.",

Moreover, it can be argued that bias against a certain group of people on the basis of a limited set of probable confounded factors might lead to shame, stress, and stigma that prevent true carriers from reporting their condition to official bodies and receiving timely health-care attention. In the face of a public health crisis at a globalised scale, ethical consideration is far from being purely intellectual\u2014it is at the core of any effective measure.",
