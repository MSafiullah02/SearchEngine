            "text": "The neutron star merger GW170817 marked the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy because it was the first gravitational wave event with a recorded electromagnetic counterpart1. As the neutron stars merged, they released a short flash of gamma rays, followed by electromagnetic radiation from different processes including the radioactive radiation emitted in the formation of heavy elements \u2014 a fireworks show known as a kilonova. Less than 2 s after the merger was detected by LIGO and Virgo, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected the gamma-ray burst. Telescopes around the world started looking for the electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos, with more than 50 teams of astronomers mobilized for the task. \u201cIt was majestic science, but also a very intense experience,\u201d says Mansi Kasliwal, principal investigator of GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen), an international collaboration studying fast-changing events (transients) such as supernovae, neutron stars or black hole mergers using a network of telescopes around the world. The amount of data recorded kept scientists busy for months with the full analysis. But already by October 2017 more than 30 papers had been published in various journals including varied results such as a new measurement of the Hubble constant2 and the confirmation that heavy elements are created in such neutron star mergers through the rapid neutron capture process3.",

The combined mass of this binary system (about 3.4 solar masses) is much larger than was expected from the known galactic neutron star binaries4. Interestingly, the event was detected only by the Livingston interferometer, because the Hanford detector was temporarily offline at the time and the Virgo data had a low signal to noise ratio. Still, the data from Virgo were useful to identify the area of the sky from which the event originated. GW190425 left astronomers reassessing the existing theories of how neutron star pairs are formed. More data and new simulations are needed to solve the puzzle of the unexpectedly high mass of the merger.",

However, some alerts were sent to astronomers when events were detected with a high confidence level. In O3, things changed completely with the debut of the new public alert system. This automated system sends an alert within minutes of the detection of a gravitational wave event. Not all alerts survive closer scrutiny and some are retracted. However, the public alerts allow astronomers to respond swiftly with multi-messenger hunts for an electromagnetic counterpart.",

Being able to follow the alerts in real time does provide a sense of excitement for everyone. \u201cIt is fun and intriguing to know about an event at almost the same time as the members of LIGO\u2013Virgo team,\u201d adds Vecchio. But at the same time he stresses that the public alerts \u201conly provide a very limited amount of information, essentially the key information that allows astronomers to point telescopes at the right region of the sky at the right time.\u201d To confirm the nature of an event and characterize it, a full analysis is required and that can take months of rigorous examination of the data.",

This event is possibly a neutron star\u2013black hole merger, although that has yet to be confirmed. Although there have been other hints, such an event would be a first to be detected, and could have an associated electromagnetic counterpart. \u201cThat would surely be big news as far as astronomy is concerned, and there is a lot of excitement surrounding this possibility,\u201d says Vecchio. The event was followed up by many teams. \u201cWe found a tantalizing counterpart called DG19wxnjc which photometrically showed all the hallmark signatures of a kilonova,\u201d says Kasliwal. Unfortunately, the near-infrared spectrum from the Keck telescope betrayed the event as a supernova, so it was not associated with S190814bv. \u201cWhat this guy really is, I\u2019m afraid everyone will need to wait until we complete the analysis and publish the paper,\u201d says Vecchio.",

But during this time the construction of the underground gravitational wave detector in Japan, KAGRA, was completed. LIGO\u2013Virgo resumed operating in November, recording more events, and on 25 February 2020 KAGRA came online. Provided that KAGRA reached sufficient sensitivity it could have joined the O3, which would have ended in force at the end of April with four detectors running. Unfortunately, in March the COVID-19 pandemic slowed everything down. After a couple of weeks of operation with very limited personnel on the sites, the increasingly critical situation in Italy and the USA forced a premature end to the run on 27 March.",
