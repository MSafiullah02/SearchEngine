However, due to the nature of contact tracing, public concern on privacy issues has been a bottleneck to the existing solutions, which is significantly affecting the uptake of contact tracing applications across the globe. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt blockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize the user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract tracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the additional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible. Results show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and mobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public, the proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities, companies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy effective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic soon.",

Communities and cities that implemented NPI early in COVID-19 pandemic are successfully reducing the number of cases while the adopted measure remaining in place. This resulted in a significant reduction in the mortality rate. However, strict measures pose an immediate threat to the economy. This matters as economic decline itself has an adverse effect on many aspects of society including health. Goldman Sachs has predicted that the US economy could shrink by 24% in the second quarter of 2020, more than twice as much as any decline ever recorded [10] . Most countries across the globe are developing balanced strategies to take both economy and a rebound of the COVID-19 into consideration. Contact tracing has been a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades and shows its effectiveness on COVID-19 control in some countries. With no obvious prospect of vaccines on the horizon [11] , the strategy of most governments across the globe (e.g. US, Spain, UK, Italy, Germany, etc.) for easing out the social distancing restrictions centers more on track and trace approach. This approach will further help to rescue the economy while also saving lives and restoring some normality, especially when the lockdown is lifted (or partially lifted) and the society steps into a \"New Normal\".",

            "text": "Contact tracing is the process of identifying persons who may have come into contact with an infected person and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts [12] . Contact tracing has a long history in preventing infectious diseases, in the early stage of epidemiology, contact tracing takes part with labor-intensive methods. The process relied heavily on the recall of a (far from complete) list of people whom they have been in contact with over the previous weeks, or locations the confirmed person has been. Letters, phone [6] Bluetooth High Low Low Yes, Partially UK NHS Contact Tracing [7] Bluetooth High Low Low Yes, Partially China Health Code System [8] GPS, QR code Low Medium High No BeepTrace (proposed solution) GPS, Bluetooth, Cellular and WiFi Medium High High Yes calls or emails can be used to inform people who might be contacted. Thus, completeness and accuracy of the list, timeliness and efficiency of the tracing are limited by such a traditional contact tracing approach. Until very recently, digitized contact tracing through smartphone apps are developed and deployed in some countries to solve the bottlenecks of the labor intensive-methods. One of the mainstream contact tracing approaches is to use Bluetooth signals from smartphones to detect encounters with people with COVID-19. This approach does not use location tracking or store users' location data. In this approach, if someone develops COVID-19 symptoms, an alert could be sent to others that they might have infected, with minimum intervention. There are two variants of the Bluetooth-based contract tracking, namely, the centralized and the decentralized model. Singapore's TraceTogether [5] is an example of a centralized model. On the other hand, the information is kept on the user's smartphone in the decentralized model and this gives more control to the user. Processing and matching for people who may have contacted COVID-19 are made on the user's smartphone in a decentralized model. Moreover, the decentralized model has been promoted by an international consortium including Google and Apple as it promotes consent, transparency, and privacy [6] . In the former, gathered anonymous data is uploaded to the server. Matches are made with other contacts via processing on the server if someone starts to develop the COVID-19 symptoms. For simplicity, in the next, we omit the word \"digital\" and use the term \"contact tracing\" representing the smartphone App-based digital contact tracing.",

Therefore, it is considered not genuinely privacy-serving, if the malicious activity is by the central service provider. Google Apple Contact Tracing employs a similar approach with Bluetooth LE too. It is different from TraceTogether from the user's privacy perspective since the service provider does not get hold of the user's real identity, hence becomes privacypreserving. However, the user is required to use their central server for contact matching and notification, which brings the concern of trajectory attack on user privacy and enables the reconstruction of the user's profile using access information to the server.

Other issues include guaranteeing the protection of the identity of users with COVID-19. Though the opt-in option could ensure some control over participation, it is yet to be seen how we ensure that only the relevant data are shared. Blockchain can play a neutral role in a distributed manner to bridge the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize the user ID and location information. It can provide a solution for privacy-preserving from technical design rather than relying on the obey the regulations or laws in a centralized system. Furthermore, blockchain technology when combined with the use of encryption and anonymization technologies can further protect the users' identity. Blockchain in nature is non-regional thus provide a suitable global access platform for COVID-19 pandemic tracing and control. The transparency feature can prevent the public from intentional misinformation by authorities or other third parties. More details about blockchain will be provided in Section II.",

We deem that no compromise should be made between the privacy and tracing performance, hence we present our blockchain-enabled contact tracing that satisfies both privacy and performance requirements. We have summarized these aspects below: a) Enhanced privacy as the main focus: Contact tracing in nature is sensitive to the general public's privacy and security, hence the privacy should be respected in the solution framework design. It is the most concerning factor in all contact tracing proposals we have seen recently. Meanwhile, and the more information collected, the better performance of contact tracing. However, privacy should never be sacrificed. Meanwhile, the secured data sharing is another challenge for privacy, it would be a hard decision to make, choosing between health and the consent of centralized privacy collection, since the centralization brings the risk of manipulation and corruption. Nevertheless, it is not a trouble for blockchain, where the identity is removed at the beginning, offering the tracing participants with ultimate confidence in privacy.",

            "text": "b) No compromise of tracing performance: By preserving the privacy from the users, we believe the performance of contact tracing also matters. The performance of the tracing network should be valued from its effectiveness of infection prevention, including the level of technology and the coverage of the network. The current decentralized solutions are limited to a local network, hence do not have impacts on a wider range of users. For example, people who travel across different areas for work and leisure in the post lockdown period may benefit from a wider range of tracing. Blockchain in nature can be the key to enable the globally accessible tracing network. It is also a challenge for government-initiated tracing projects or Apple Google joint effort [5]- [7] , since their reach is limited either by political or technical reasons, for instance, Google has no accessibility in China. We aim to utilize the blockchain, making all users connected to the chain without violating their privacy. Moreover, to make use of all the possible tracing information, a framework for supporting all means of positioning technologies is required. The information shared on the blockchain can hence be propagated further and is a lot richer than Bluetooth interactions. c) No panic from misinformation: Misinformation is harmful to pandemic prevention and causes panic to the general public. The main reason for the misinformation can be concluded into two categories: information inaccuracy and information transparency. The public health agencies have strong reasons to get the trusted authorities involved in the result confirmation, geographical matching, and notification, in order to fight against misinformation of inaccuracy. Though getting the authorities involved might not sound promising for the fact of privacy, it is not the case for the blockchain network, thanks to the privacy-preserving ability. The panic should not be caused by the tracing and never will be. Meanwhile, the authorities have the motivation to hold back information or provide false statistics due to their favor of decisions enabled by the centralization of data. With the help of the transparency provided by the blockchain technology, it enables the easy verifiable trusted tracing information by the public rather than a closed group of informants. d) Full life cycle privacy protection: It is acknowledged widely that privacy should be valued from the start to its end, hence a full life cycle solution of privacy for contact tracing is necessary. The shared data should have its life cycle managed from users' tip of fingers. The users of contact tracing shall have full privilege to share and revoke sharing at any time using key management. Public agencies are also required to limit the sharing of users' sensitive information within a trusted partnership. The proposed blockchain platform is capable of providing users and agencies with thorough credential management functionality with cryptography. The user's privacy is protected throughout the tracing scheme, and the length of data storage should also be regulated under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) [17] , and health agencies' recommendations, for example, WHO recommended that 14 days is the minimum length of tracing cycle. In short, the user will have all its privacy protected through generation, sharing, and deposition.",

User privacy is respected with full life cycle awareness, as it can be generated, shared, and disposed of safely. Meanwhile, BeepTrace proposes an architectural view of blockchain address and transaction design making use of two chains, to facilities the analysis of geodata and passive notification. We propose a novel scheme to decouple user privacy by using two distributed blockchains. The tracing chain with desensitized personal location information is accessible by authorized solvers for contact matching. And the notification chain, where the match results (only pseudonym or its fingerprint) will be published on for the exposed usersself matching locally. Through this Gemini chain design, all users' privacy can be preserved effectively. We also provide numerical results to give an overview of the network storage and computing capacity requirement with typical parameters setting. In addition to network cost, an analysis of data consumption for an individual user is also calculated to address the concerns of the device requirement.",

Besides its chain-link data structure nature, the Consensus Mechanism (CM) is of great importance to achieving the unique gains of blockchain. The CM ensures an unambiguous ordering of transactions and guarantees the integrity and consistency of the blockchain across geographically distributed nodes. The CM largely determines blockchain system performance, such as transaction throughput, delay, node scalability, and security level, etc. As such, depending on application scenarios and performance requirements, different CMs have been considered for blockchain. Important requirements to be considered when selecting the CM in BeepTrace include network throughput, delay, storage, and scalability.

Each node involved in the CM uses its computing resource for the hash process to compete for the right to the new block while receiving some bonus. This leads to the use of computing resources and meaningless energy consumption. PoS, on the other hand, relies on coin age competition rather than computing power competition. PoS is thus beneficial for the wealthy miner and it could cause near-monopolies, which can result in the generation of a powerful third-party. This could also be a challenge in BeepTrace where the users' privacy at stake. By design, a more balanced weighting scheme on coin age can solve such a problem. Both PoW and PoS CM work on a single chain architecture. To maintain a single version of the blockchain among the users, the CM must reduce the access rate of new blocks [18] . This could lead to some bottlenecks in applying PoW and PoS CMs to a large number of contact tracing participants (e.g., a country with a large population like China, India).",

Furthermore, with the limited capacity of the new blocks in PoS and PoW, the system will be unable to cope with the exponential growth in the number of users. For instance, the throughput is normally limited to 7 transactions per second (TPS) in Bitcoin and 20 to 30 TPS in Ethereum [21] . The low access rate of new blocks in PoW and PoS CMs implies a long confirmation delay for the CMs. Typical confirmation delays of 60 minutes in Bitcoin and three minutes in Ethereum are too long for the BeepTrace system since other delays within the network such as access delay, processing delay must be incorporated as well. Nevertheless, the throughput and delay performance can be significantly enhanced by reducing the difficulty level of harsh calculation security level (e.g., in BeepTrace, there is no need to wait for the block confirmation after 6 blocks are generated after it).

Moreover, with the forking integrated into DAG, the resource consumption can be very low for a user to create a new block, thus making it very suitable for the BeepTrace system.

For instance, the road topology can indicate the trajectory, determine if the user is outdoor or indoor. Such information fusion and processing can bring the contact tracing not only beyond the geodata, but also explores social connections. Speaking of which, it is unimaginable if the privacy is exposed or hijacked by any malicious party, therefore, privacypreserving is not an option but a must. By adding the GIS into the solving loop, the external topology can be taken into account, for example, if the geodata is found out to be at the center of a shopping mall, then the shopping mall's topological information can be obtained from OSM and used to warn the rest of the people who were in the shopping mall at the same time.

Hence we can obtain an estimation of computing resource requirement against the number of users and daily confirmed cases. In Fig. 4(a) , using the same setup from the previous simulation, i.e., 30 minutes an address regularly in 24 hours a day, we can see the number of records increases linearly with the number of daily confirmed cases, but exponentially with the overall participants' number.

It is going to consume the user's computing, storage, and network resources. In BeepTrace, the geodata solver marked addresses are announced on the notification blockchain, which is exclusive to the matching results. Assuming in each location it stayed, there will be R = 15 blockchain addresses associated with the patient's Computing Resource Requirement for Contact Tracing Geodata matching geodata. Therefore, assume that the patient was traveling constantly and stayed in different places every 30 minutes in 14 hours (typical active time for an adult during a day). It means each patient will incur 420 records for the geodata solving and accumulating up to 5880 records for a 14 days interval. Note that, in the real world situation, the patient might interact with hundreds or even thousands of addresses in one time at one address, but only the most closed contact will lead to infection, hence the number of users being tagged by the geodata solver will be significantly less than the crowds the patient interacted. By adding all the records up, there is a challenge of processing and storing such a large volume of data, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . The raw data recorded on the blockchain will be too heavy for the user side, therefore, we have to compress the associated blockchain addresses with MD5 checksum [28] or other fingerprints to reduce the size of files. Meanwhile, the solver side will need to employ a mechanism to remove duplicates and produce a single risk level endorsement for all the match geodata that associated with a single pseudonym. The number of records can be reduced to 210 and 16byte for each address's fingerprint, which is calculated based on a 14 hour active time per day in 14 days (14 x 15) since the daily records of 28 are summarized by the solver into one record, and pseudonym changes daily. By compressing the data using the above methods, we can see a dramatic drop in data consumption, 33.6MB for R = 15, 6.7MB for R = 3 per day, hence enabling a wider user range and minimizing the users' cost. More details regarding storage optimization can be found in Section VI. As for the uploading cost, the total amount of data upload to tracing blockchain throughout a day will be 28 addresses of 64byte, which is considerably less than download from notification blockchain.

It is a great challenge running the desired hundreds of millions of transactions per second on any existing blockchain solution. Luckily, the needs of such high TPS is rare in the real world, for example, it is reasonable to assume that a user does not travel internationally often, therefore the needs of the user data are completely met in the domestic blockchain network. In addition, all parameters are selected at typical maximum values to see the peak requirement. For instance, it is not reasonable to assume all people (in all ages) are active 14 hours every day. We also encourage the use of multiple blockchains by regionally grouping the users via PKI and public keys management. By dividing users into smaller groups, the network capacity can be easily scaled up. Besides, the emerging high throughput ready blockchain can be introduced to the deployment of BeepTrace, for instance, DAG (Directed acyclic graph) in theory has no throughput limit thanks to its intentionally designed forking schemes [18] . And when the technology is ready for high throughput performance, we can easily migrate two or more regional chains together and speed up the sharing of the information.",

By sending the data only when the mobile device is being charged, our scheme becomes more battery-friendly. Delaying the information upstream can induce lower performance in the contact tracing network, but it is completely acceptable to be notified a few hours later rather than immediate response due to the nature of tracing lag. Also, geodata generation is paused if the user's locations remain the same, which also reduces the entries to the blockchain.
