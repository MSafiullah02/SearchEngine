Here, we report that BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A survives a single nucleotide missing in its C-terminal eGFP region. By using our established reverse genetics system for BVDV, we confirm that the viral mutant is rescued through a \u22121/+2 ORF initiated in the N pro (1-19)/eGFP region of the mutant viral genome. We furthermore uncover that this event occurs in the N pro (1-19) region of BVDV strain SD-1. The rescued viral mutant showed dramatic reductions in levels of both viral RNA and viral protein in host cells. Although the mutant is similar to the native strain in viral kinetics, the peak yield of the mutant is decreased dramatically. These findings reveal the existence of an alternative \u22121/+2 ORF in the N pro (1-19) region during the replication of BVDV and open a new avenue to understand the life cycle and pathogenesis of pestiviruses.",

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the major pathogens causing significant economic loss of cattle production and reproduction the world wide. As the prototype virus of the pestivirus genus, BVDV has a genome consisting of a single-stranded, positive-oriented RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb. BVDV, like other members in the flaviviridae family, contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that is flanked with a 5 -nontranslated region (5 -NTR) and a 3untranslated region (3 -NTR) and encodes a single polyprotein. The viral polyprotein is initiated cap-independently from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5 -NTR and proteolytically cleaved to yield the viral proteins, specifically for BVDV, four structural proteins (core, E rns , E1 and E2) and at least seven nonstructural proteins (N pro , P7, NS2/3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003) .",

N pro is a cysteine proteinase which cleaves at its own C-terminal cysteine and serine dipeptide site to release the N-terminus of viral capsid (C) protein (Rumenapf et al., 1998; Stark et al., 1993) . Other than this, N pro has not been found to be essential for viral replication (Fan and Bird, 2008a; Tratschin et al., 1998) . Currently, whether or not this viral protein participates in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. However, recent evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that pestivirus N pro is a pivotal factor in inhibiting the host innate immune system (Bauhofer et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2007; Gil et al., 2006; Hilton et al., 2006; Horscroft et al., 2005; La Rocca et al., 2005; Ruggli et al., 2005; Seago et al., 2007) and might be a critical determinant for the establishment of persistent fetal infection of BVDV (Meyers et al., 2007) .",

Interestingly, numerous studies had showed that an additional HCV protein of approximately 16 kDa is biosynthesized from the initiator codon of the viral polyprotein sequence followed by a +1/\u22122 translational ribosomal frameshift operating in the region of core protein codons (Baril and Brakier-Gingras, 2005; Boulant et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2003; Cristina et al., 2005; McMullan et al., 2007; Rijnbrand et al., 2001; Varaklioti et al., 2002; Vassilaki and Mavromara, 2003; Walewski et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2001) .

            "text": "As reported previously (Fan and Bird, 2008a) , BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A is an engineered N pro -disrupted reporter BVDV derived from an infectious BAC cDNA clone, pBSD1-N pro /eGFP2A, with a NCP BVDV SD-1 background (Deng and Brock, 1992) . BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A was designed to express a chimeric eGFP2A protein that was introduced into viral polyprotein by replacing the whole N pro protein except its first 19 amino acids. The eGFP2A was created with a foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A protease (FMDV 2A pro ) attached to C-terminus of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) ( Fig. 1A and B ). This design assures the successful release of eGFP2A chimera from viral nascent polyprotein precursor by taking advantage of FMDV 2A pro protease activity (Fan and Bird, 2008a; Fan et al., 2008; Ryan and Drew, 1994; Ryan et al., 1991) . During one of our attempts to optimize the assay, infectious viruses were rescued after MDBK cells were transfected with the run-off RNAs in vitro transcribed from pBSD1-N pro /eGFP2A (data not shown). RT-PCR of viral RNA using primer pair BVD424 and BVD1172 that target the viral N pro (1-19)/eGFP2A/C coding region (nt 390-1172, by reference to the nucleotides of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A) identified a unique cDNA band of approximately 1.1 kb ( Fig. 2A) . Direct nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA products found a single cytosine nucleotide missing at nt 1044 (c1044 ) (Fig. 2B ). Nucleotide sequencing did not find any other mutation(s) in viral genome of the rescued virus (Data not shown). These results reveal that a mutant viral genome is the solely infectious RNA molecule present in the infected MDBK cells. The acquired mutation of the mutant virus is located in the 3 -end of the viral eGFP region. Here, we name the rescued mutant virus as BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 . 3.2. Existence of an additional \u22121/+2 ORF in the infectious reporter BVDV Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that mutation c1044 causes a frameshift with the formation of a premature stop codon (TGA at nt 1069-1071) in eGFP coding region, 54 nucleotides before the FMDV 2A pro sequence (Fig. 3) . The appearance of this stop codon in the original viral 0/0 ORF of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 is supposed to direct the generation of an unstable, fluorescencedeficient variant of eGFP protein that is C-terminal 18-AA truncated (Dopf and Horiagon, 1996) and no viable viruses should be generated (Fig. 3) . Based on this observation, we postulated that BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 can be rescued only through a \u22121/+2 ORF that must exist and initiate in the coding region of either N pro (1-19) or eGFP. Furthermore, it is obvious that, no matter which coding region this event falls in, a functional eGFP protein is not supposed to be produced. As expected, different from BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-infeced MDBK cells that showed a time-dependent, rapid elevation of green fluorescent protein as measured by a combination of fluorescence microscopy (FM), FACS and western blotting at 12, 36, and 60 h post infection (p.i.) (Fig. 4A -C) (Fan et al., 2008) , MDBK cells infected with BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 did not show any fluorescence signal as determined by both IFM and FACS as checked at all three time points ( Fig. 4A and B) . In addition, green fluorescent protein was not detectable in the mutant virus-infected cells as checked in a time-course western blotting assay (Fig. 4C ). Taken together, these data conclusively reveals the existence of an additional ORF in viral N pro (1-19)/eGFP region.",

After five additional blind passages in MDBK cells with the culture supernatant, the rescued mutant virus was confirmed to be deficient in GFP generation as assayed with a western blotting assay (Fig. 5C ). The N pro (1-19)/eGFP2A/C coding sequence was stably retained in viral genomes as analyzed with RT-PCR of viral RNA extracted from the viruses both at passage 5 (Fig. 5D ). Nucleotide sequencing of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the rescued viruses retain the original nucleotide sequence of the N pro (1-19)/eGFP2A/C region as engineered (Fig. 5E ). These results confirmed our observation that an additional ORF exists in the viral N pro (1-19)/eGFP region. Furthermore, these data indicates that it is a \u22121/+2 ORF but not a +1/\u22122 ORF that exists during viral replication, initiates in viral N pro (1-19)/eGFP coding region, and alternatively directed the rescue of BVDV mutant BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 .",

BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A is characteristic of a disrupted N pro protein (N pro 1-19) with its most C-terminal amino acids replaced with a reporter protein chimera, eGFP2A. The eGFP2A chimera was designed to consist of eGFP and FMDV 2A protease in such a way that eGFP2A can be cleaved from the viral precursor polyprotein of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A and can be maintained stably in infected-MDBK cells (Fan and Bird, 2008a; Fig. 3 . Mutation c1044 leads to the formation of a premature stop codon in mutant viral genome. Comparison of nucleotide sequences and amino acids deduced from the N pro (1-19)/eGFP sequence of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A and BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 . The numbers on the left show that position of nucleotides and amino acids. The underlined letters show where the single cytosine nucleotide missing is in the BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 genome. The boxed TGA represents the premature stop codon formed in the eGFP region due to a frameshift mutation in BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 genome. Fan et al., 2008) . Failure to obtain such a recombinant virus in one of our attempts showed us a very interesting phenomenon. Namely, infectious viruses were indeed obtained, however green fluorescent protein was not detectable. Direct nucleotide sequencing identified a cytosine nucleotide missing at nt 1044 (c1044 ) of the genome of the rescued virus. Since the mutation causes a frameshift with formation of a premature stop codon (TGA at nt 1069-1071) in C-terminal eGFP about 18 AA before FMDV 2A pro a C-terminal 18 amino acid-truncated eGFP protein are supposed to be translated from the original viral 0/0 ORF. This finding explained why functional GFP protein was not detectable in this case because C-terminal truncation of even 6 amino acids already results in a complete fluorescence loss of the mutant GFP protein (Dopf and Horiagon, 1996) . It is interesting to see that the mutant GFP protein was even not detected in the western blotting assay. This happened probably due to the fact that the antibody applied in the assay cannot recognize the C-terminal 18 AA truncated mutant GFP protein.",

Primer pair of BVD424P and BVD1172 was utilized for RT-PCR. M: 1 kb DNA ladder; Lane 1. cDNA fragment amplified from viral RNA of \u22121/+2 frame-representing virus with an expected size of 1100 bp. Lane 2. cDNA fragments amplified from viral RNA of BSD1 with an expected size of 750 bp; and Lane 3: blank reaction (no templates) as negative control. (E) Single cytosine nucleotide deletion at nt 1044 was detected at the 3 -end of the eGFP coding region of the \u22121/+2 frame-representing virus genome. The shown nucleotide sequences of partial viral genomes were amplified from viral RNAs of viruses representing 0/0 or \u22121/+2 frame, respectively. The numbers show the nucleotide positions referring to the genomic sequence of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A. However, in this specific case, the involvement of FMDV 2A pro sequence in directing the generation of viable viruses is immediately excluded. The reason is simply due to the occurrence of a premature stop codon 54 nt upstream of the FMDV 2A pro coding region in mutant viral genome. Following the original viral 0/0 ORF of the mutant viral genome, the protein translation is already ceased even before the ribosome can reach the FMDV 2A coding region to perform the ribosome skipping event. Considering that viral capsid protein is essential for formation of infectious viruses and must be synthesized first and then released from the viral polyprotein catalyzed by the 17 AA FMDV 2A pro it is reasonable to postulate that an alternative \u22121/+2 ORF exists in the viral genome and this event must occur before the coding sequence of FMDV 2A pro , namely in the N pro (1-19)/eGFP coding region. By using our BAC-based reverse genetics system we find out that this event operating occurs in the N pro (1-19) region of the native BVDV SD-1, suggesting that the \u22121/+2 ORF of the viral genome probably has nothing to do with the heterologous eGFP insertion or FMDV 2A pro sequence but seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of the native virus. The rescued virus is much lower than its parent virus in viral RNA, viral protein, and virus titer, indicating that the \u22121/+2 ORF of BVDV has a much lower efficacy than the original viral 0/0 ORF in viral protein translation.",

Analysis of the mutation effect on growth property of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 . (A) By defining the rescued virus as passage 0, BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 was passaged six more times in MDBK cells. The virus titer was determined for each passage and virus titer curve was generated by plotted against virus passage. The graph shows average values derived from three independently generated experiments. (B) MDBK cells were infected with either BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A or BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 at an MOI of either 1.0 FFU/cell or 0.1 FFU/cell. At various time points p.i. as indicated, virus titers were determined. Viral growth curves were generated by plotted against time. Here, BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 and BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A were designated by empty and solid circles, respectively. The graph shows average values derived from three independently generated experiments. (C) Viral genomic RNA was quantitatively measured. MDBK cells were infected with BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 or BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A. Cells were harvested at indicated time points p.i., total cellular RNA was isolated and quantified for viral genomic RNA in quantitative RT-PCR. Here, total cellular RNA extracted from BVDV-negative MDBK cells were set as the negative control and the error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. (D) Viral E2 protein accumulation of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A-c1044 as compared to that of BSD1-N pro /eGFP2A. Virus-and mock-infected MDBK cells were treated as described in Section 2. Viral protein accumulation was reflected by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the E2-positive cells and is indicated in the plot. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. N pro (1-19) region of BVDV SD-1. Since the polyprotein translation of pestiviruses as well as other flaviviruses are initiated at the internal ribosome element site (IRES) the existence of a second internal translation initiation site at the 5 -end of N pro region is much low. However, with current available evidence, this possibility cannot be excluded. Our next research focus will be directed to search for the exact translational ribosome frameshift site or the internal translational initiation site in the N pro (1-19) region of BVDV SD-1 and to determine if the sequence and structure of BVDV 5 -NTR have any effects on this event.",

            "text": "Translational ribosome frameshift for gene expression has been reported existing in the life cycle of many RNA viruses such as retrovirus (Jacks and Varmus, 1985) , coronaviruses (Brierley, 1995) and astroviruses (Marczinke et al., 1994) . In 1994, the flaviviridae family member, hepatitis C virus (HCV), was reported to encode an additional HCV polypeptide of around 16 kDa (Lo et al., 1994) . Several following studies confirmed this observation and further showed that an additional HCV ORF overlaps the core gene in the +1 frame (core +1 ORF) (Choi et al., 2003; Roussel et al., 2003; Varaklioti et al., 2002; Walewski et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2001) . This polypeptide can be synthesized in vitro from the initiator codon of the viral polyprotein sequence followed by a +1 translational ribosome frameshift operating occurring in the coding region of core codons 8-14 (Vassilaki et al., 2008) . Circulating anti-core +1 antibodies have been detected in HCV-infected individuals, suggesting that this protein is produced during natural HCV infection (Choi et al., 2003; Roussel et al., 2003; Varaklioti et al., 2002; Walewski et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2001) . These data together show that, besides i. as indicated, virus titers were determined. Viral growth curves were generated by plotted against time. Here, BSD1 and BSD1-g442 were designated by empty and solid circles, respectively. The graph shows average values derived from three independently generated experiments. (E) Viral RNA genome was quantitatively measured in a time-course manner. MDBK cells were infected with BSD1 or BSD1-g442 . Cells were harvested at indicated time points p.i., total cellular RNA was isolated and quantified as described above in quantitative RT-PCR. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. (F) Accumulation of intracellular viral E2 protein of BSD1-g442 as compared to that of BSD1.

Accumulation of viral E2 protein was reflected by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the E2-positive cells and is indicated in the plot. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. its role in viral assembly, the core protein of HCV might play a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis (Brierley, 1995; Futterer et al., 1993; Jayakar and Whitt, 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2000; Latorre et al., 1998; Pavlakis and Felber, 1990; Stacey et al., 2000) . In most recent years, researchers observed that translational ribosome frameshift event also exists in many other flaviviridae family viruses such as Dengue virus (Firth and Atkins, 2009; Firth et al., 2010) , Japanese Encephalitis Virus (Melian et al., 2010) and West Nile virus (Youn et al., 2010) . Although we cannot determine with current available evidence that BVDV exhibits a translational frameshift event during its replication, it is possible that translational ribosome frameshift for gene expression is probably a common strategy that is applied by many virus members of all three genera in flaviviridae family to synthesize more viral proteins with their limited genetic materials. Specifically for BVDV SD-1, however, we noticed that an additional \u22121/+2 ORF in N pro (1-19) region causes the generation of a peptide with a maximum size of 29 amino acids (data not shown). If there exists a translational ribosome frameshift site or an internal translational initiation site in the N pro (1-19) region and the biological relevance of this additional \u22121/+2 ORF during BVDV life cycle needs to be carefully investigated in the future.",
