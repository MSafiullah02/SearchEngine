Upon admission, the patient was immediately isolated. Low/high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, antiviral (oseltamivir 75 mg and interferon alfa-1b 30ug, twice daily), and antibiotic (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) therapies were initiated (Supplementary Figure 1). He developed shortness of breath and hypoxemia (Supplementary Table), resulting in the use of methylprednisolone and continuous positive airway pressure support. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the evidence of chest images and confirmed by the positive result of RT-PCR test (cycle threshold (Ct) 27.6; Ct <37 represents a positive test) on a throat swab sample on January 14. Oseltamivir was replaced by ribavirin (500 mg twice daily). His body temperature reduced to \u226437.7\u00b0C in the next 5 days with less pulmonary infiltrates apparent on radiograph (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B) but his respiratory symptoms did not improve. Hypoxemia reappeared on January 20 (Supplementary Table) and invasive mechanical ventilation was initiated. Superimposed bacterial and fungal infections were observed. Septic shock, consolidation on chest images (Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D), and progressive respiratory failure that were refractory to intervention by tracheostomy and therapies of lopinavir, ritonavir, and broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal drugs developed (Supplementary Figure 1). On January 30, the patient received veno-arterio-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after which his vital signs remained largely stable. Real-time RT-PCR tests were regularly performed on his multiple clinical samples after the diagnosis (Figure). Positive results were found in samples of sputum on January 19 (Ct 26.0), bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid on January 22 (Ct 24.2) and 26 (Ct 20.3), and nasopharyngeal swab on January 31 (Ct 33.5). On January 31, he received 400 milliliters of convalescent plasma donated by a recovered COVID-19 patient. Negative RT-PCR test results on various biological samples were detected for the next 12 days.",

He developed shortness of breath and hypoxemia (Supplementary Table), resulting in the use of methylprednisolone and continuous positive airway pressure support. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the evidence of chest images and confirmed by the positive result of RT-PCR test (cycle threshold (Ct) 27.6; Ct <37 represents a positive test) on a throat swab sample on January 14. Oseltamivir was replaced by ribavirin (500 mg twice daily). His body temperature reduced to \u226437.7\u00b0C in the next 5 days with less pulmonary infiltrates apparent on radiograph (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B) but his respiratory symptoms did not improve. Hypoxemia reappeared on January 20 (Supplementary Table) and invasive mechanical ventilation was initiated. Superimposed bacterial and fungal infections were observed. Septic shock, consolidation on chest images (Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D), and progressive respiratory failure that were refractory to intervention by tracheostomy and therapies of lopinavir, ritonavir, and broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal drugs developed (Supplementary Figure 1). On January 30, the patient received veno-arterio-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after which his vital signs remained largely stable. Real-time RT-PCR tests were regularly performed on his multiple clinical samples after the diagnosis (Figure). Positive results were found in samples of sputum on January 19 (Ct 26.0), bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid on January 22 (Ct 24.2) and 26 (Ct 20.3), and nasopharyngeal swab on January 31 (Ct 33.5). On January 31, he received 400 milliliters of convalescent plasma donated by a recovered COVID-19 patient. Negative RT-PCR test results on various biological samples were detected for the next 12 days. Intra-pulmonary bleeding and obstruction, with \"white-out\" radiograph of both lungs were seen on February 7, 2020. The patient suffered from rapidly deteriorating hypoxemia, complicated with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure and thus a multidisciplinary team considered organ transplantation. After the ethical approval by the admitting hospital and informed consent from the patient's family were obtained, the transplantation was performed on 15-16 February, 2020. Unfortunately, the patient died from an uncontrolled loss of blood. During the transplantation, tissue samples (20 grams for each side) were taken from the recipient's bilateral lungs after opening the chest for RT-PCR tests. The results (Figure) were positive with Ct values of 34.2 (the second test 35.3) and 34.3 (the second test 34.9) in the left and right lungs, respectively.The present study was limited to not having the virus in tissue samples cultured. Even though we tested live lung tissue samples, the detection of part of the viral genome do not necessarily mean that the virus is capable of infection. Data on the contagiousness of these discharged patients retesting as positive is lacking; greater efforts need to be made to solve the existing questions on this population.",
