Common stains include the Gram stain, first described by HC Gram in 1884 but still in everyday use, the Ziehl-Neelsen or acid-fast stain for mycobacteria and the modified Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain for nocardia. The Gram stain divides bacteria into Gram positive or Gram negative depending on the ability of the cell wall to prevent decolourisation after staining with crystal violet. It is important to remember that bacteria such as S. aureus and Pseudomonas species are not stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen stain and conversely mycobacteria cannot be seen on a Gram stain. Culture techniques also differ with mycobacteria often unable to grow on conventional agar plates, requiring special growth media and prolonged culture periods. Therefore if mycobacterial infection is suspected the request form for the sample must specify \u2018mycobacterial culture\u2019 so the appropriate investigations are performed by the laboratory.",

Otherwise a rifamycin agent should be used in the regimen.the minimum duration is 6 months but some experts prefer a minimum of 9 months in the transplant setting. Longer treatment is required for severe or disseminated infection or for infection involving the central nervous system and/or bone and joint and in pulmonary disease with ongoing AFB detectable in sputum (>2 months)streptomycin should not be used in the lung transplant setting because of the associated high-risk of nephrotoxicity. immunosuppressive agents used to prevent rejection may only require minimal or no dose reduction.
