In addition to immune deficiency, HIV-1 is the direct source for a number of neurological symptoms, suggesting that HIV-1 is able to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and cause neurocognitive impairment, especially at later stages of the infection. The HIV-1 Nef protein is an accessory protein that plays an important role in the infectivity, persistence and pathology of the virus. Its importance in the progression of AIDS is evident, since it is known that deletion or absence of Nef attenuates the symptoms in HIV patients [1]. The downmodulation of cell surface levels of CD4 as well as the downmodulation of major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules, the mediation of cellular signaling and activation, and the enhancement of viral particle infectivity are the four most thoroughly documented Nef activities that affect immune cells and have together with other aspects been extensively reviewed elsewhere [2]\u2013[5]. The number of cell surface receptors modulated by Nef is steadily increasing [6], but it is still not clear how any of these interactions contribute to HIV pathogenesis.",

At the C-terminal end, this bait contained the C-terminal part of ubiquitin (Cub) linked to the transcription factor LexA-VP16. For a lot of its activities, Nef requires dimerization, which is mediated by interactions between residues located in the Nef core region [14]. Fusion of Nef to Ost4p does not restrict dimerization in any way. The schematic of the Y2H system with the resulting bait plasmid (pDHB1-Nef) is shown in Figure 1. Preys were from a purchased human adult brain cDNA library, which covered approx. 1.75\u00d7106 independent clones and was linked to the N-terminal part of ubiquitin (Nub). The expression of the membrane-localized Nef-bait was verified by Western blotting of cell extracts using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the LexA domain (data not shown).",

It is well known that Y2H screens, like any genetic selection system, are prone to produce a certain number of false positive results. Such hits would show a His+/Ade+/lacZ+ phenotype independent of a true interaction between the bait and the prey. In order to eliminate such false positive clones, the respective pPR3 vector-DNAs of each of the 58 hits were tested for the His+/Ade+/lacZ+ phenotype. Approximately half of the initially identified hits showed \u03b2-galactosidase activity when coexpressed with the Nef-bait but not when coexpressed with the large T control bait. Only those were further considered to be Nef dependent positive hits. The results of the positive hits are summarized in Table 1 listing the names and their hit frequencies. Altogether, we identified the following proteins, although with very different frequencies: the neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6B (GPM6B), the B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31), the glycoprotein M6A (GPM6A), Tetraspanin 7 (TSPAN7), Cytochrome B5 type B (CYB5B), the receptor for transcobalamin-bound vitamin B12 (CD320/TCblR) and Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1-like protein 1 (VKORC1L1), V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4), Transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein (PMEPA1), OCIA domain containing 1 (OCIAD1), Integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), Chimerin 1 (CHN1), Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH4), Claudin 10 (CLDN10), Heat shock 70 kDa protein 9/mortalin (HSPA9), Apoptosis-related protein 3 (APR-3), Solute carrier family 31 (copper transporter), member 2 (SLC31A2), Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (PEBP1), Probable cation-transporting ATPase 13A2 (ATP13A2), V-type proton ATPase subunit S1 (ATP6AP1) and N-acetyllactosaminide beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT1). Detailed information (gene ID, subcellular localization, function) for each protein is given in the Table S1. Of those, VKORC1L1, SLC31A2, ATP13A2 and ATP6AP1 were not further considered, because they have been reported to appear unspecifically as false-positive hits based on the components of the DUALhunter system itself (for reference see http://www.dualsystems.com).",

As summarized in Table 1, these immunoprecipitations (IP) experiments confirmed the existence of precipitable immune complexes including Nef and each of the eight hit proteins tested in yeast cell lysates. Notably, detection of prey protein complexes with the SV40 large T antigen as negative control bait was weak for CHN1 and not visible for all other samples tested. This suggests that the detected Nef-prey complexes represent specific interactions and are not caused by unspecific protein aggregation.

These structures showed high levels of GPM6B (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the presence of Nef affected the extent to which the membrane extensions occurred. In general, less and shorter outgrowths were observed when Nef was present in the cells in addition to GPM6B (Figure 3B). Cos-7 cells cotransfected with pGFP-GPM6B and the empty control vector (pDsRed) did not show significant changes in the length of the extensions compared to cells transfected only with pGFP-GPM6B.

            "text": "A brief look at the GPM6B amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic loops revealed a striking similarity to residues 408 to 419 inside the cytoplasmic domain of the T-cell co-receptor CD4. This region is known to be necessary and sufficient for downregulation of CD4 by Nef (e.g. reviewed in [5], [6]) and also its direct binding to Nef is well characterized ([19]\u2013[21]). Thus, we investigated, whether any of the other proteins identified from the Y2H-screen show similarities to already known Nef interaction motifs. Comparison of residues 114 to 125 of the GPM6B cytoplasmic loop (Q13491-1) and 108\u2013119 of GPM6A with the sequence of the Nef binding motif of CD4 (amino acids 408 to 419 of the mature protein chain; Figure 4A) resulted in striking sequence similarities. In this region, GPM6B and CD4 sequences show a 50% identity and 25% similarity by only three out of twelve residues that do not fit the alignment. The alignment of the respective regions of GPM6A and PLP1 with this CD4 region also showed striking similarities (Figure 4B). This suggests that the conserved cytoplasmic loop region of GPM6B and GPM6A might contain a Nef binding site similar to that of CD4. This region is notably also conserved in the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP1), which is the prototype protein of the PLP family. As shown in Figure 4D, fluorescence titrations using purified Nef protein and synthetic FITC-labeled peptides derived from the cytoplasmic parts of GPM6B or PLP1 respectively, verified a direct and rather robust interaction between the molecules with KD values ranging below 1 \u00b5M. Mutations in CD4, in which leucines 413 and 414 were replaced with alanines, renders CD4 refractory to Nef-induced downregulation [22]\u2013[24] and at least in vitro drastically reduces the binding affinity of synthetic CD4 peptides to full-length Nef protein [20], [21]. If this is the same binding determinant as the previously identified and well known Nef binding site of CD4, one may expect that the residues in GPM6B that correspond to the dileucine-motif also play an important role. Therefore, we also analyzed a peptide variant (GPM6BAA) in which the dileucine-motif corresponding residues leucine 119 and histidine 120 of GPM6B were replaced by alanines. The relative fluorescence of FITC-labeled GPM6BAA was virtually independent of Nef concentration, suggesting that it did not bind to Nef (Figure 4D, open circles). The mutation of leucine 119 and histidine 120 to alanines drastically reduced the affinity of the examined GPM6B peptide to Nef. This clearly shows that both residues contribute to Nef-GPM6B binding. It underlines the similarities between the Nef binding sites in CD4 and PLP-like proteins. Very interestingly, also in CD320/TCblR a region with high similarity to the Nef binding site of CD4 could be identified inside its short cytoplasmic portion (Figure 4C). In this region, CD320/TCblR and CD4 sequences show also 50% identity and 25% similarity.",

In contrast, mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches often yield proteins as hits that did not necessarily bind directly to the bait but are part of multi-protein complexes that bound to the bait. In addition, because the various prey proteins are not equally expressed in their native environment, MS based studies experience problems to identify proteins as positive hits when they are expressed at very low levels. Thus, it is obvious that Y2H screens and MS based approaches have different advantages and disadvantages and therefore do not necessarily yield the same set of positive hits, but render them rather complementary.",

Such transient interactions are more easily detected by using a split-ubiquitin based Y2H screen, as was used in the present study. Here, Nef-prey complexes do not have to overcome lysis and purification steps, but only have to exist long enough to allow the ubiquitin hydrolase to separate the transactivating moiety from the Nef-prey complex, which subsequently switches on reporter gene transcription.",

Notably, in our Y2H-based screen, we independently identified HSPA9/mortalin as a binding partner of membrane-anchored Nef as well (see Table S1). Please note that mortalin belongs to the few cytosolic proteins that were identified during our screen.

HIV-1 infects microglial cells and astrocytes in the brain and an evidence of Nef being present in other cell type inside the CNS is insufficient to date. Also in recent literature, Nef has been reported to be translocated from HIV-1 infected cells to bystander cells via secretion, trogocytosis or nanotubes [37]\u2013[39] and it is conceivable that Nef might be also secreted in the CNS from microglial cells and astrocytes and thereby might indirectly affect neurons or oligodendrocytes.

Again, viruses have evolved elegant strategies to inhibit various stages of the MHC I antigen presentation pathway and thus evade a cellular surveillance mechanism (for review, see [53]). HIV-1 Nef downregulates MHC I surface expression, both by recruiting MHC I directly from the cell surface and by transporting newly synthesized MHC I molecules to lysosomes (for review see [54]). An important step during this process is the Nef mediated association of the cytoplasmic domain of MHC I with the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1) at the trans-Golgi network, which recently could be solved at atomic resolution [55]. Beside this, several observations suggest that Nef also might interact with MHC I molecules earlier during the secretory pathway ([56], [57]). A direct interaction of Nef with BAP31 would support these findings and may imply that Nef additionally could interfere with the MHC I molecules upstream of the trans-Golgi network.",

Therefore, a role of CLDN10 in tight junction formation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been postulated, [63]. Accordingly, viruses make use of claudins to disrupt the BBB and to traverse epithelial cell layers. Known targets are for example claudin 1, claudin 6 and claudin 9, which have been identified as coreceptors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry [64]. Claudin 7 is involved in the infection of CD4(-) cells through HIV-1 [65] and the HIV-1 Tat protein is held to be responsible for an increased permeability of the BBB by influencing claudins [66], [67].

Thereby the library vector (pPR3-N), without an insert in place of a cDNA library, was transformed into the Nef bait-bearing strain.

Transformants that were able to grow on selective medium were tested for their \u03b2-galactosidase activity using the filter lift-off assay (described in User manual DUALhunter kit, DUALsystems).
