Bacteria can obtain sialic acids by either de novo biosynthesis or by acquisition from the environment. Different Gram negative bacteria like Escherichia coli K1, Neisseria meningitidis, and Campylobacter jejuni, and Gram positive bacteria like Group B Streptococcus (GBS) can synthesize sialic acids [45] . Sialic acid uptake in other Gram negative bacteria like Haemophilus Influenza, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from exogenous sources has recently been established [45, 46] . These bacteria use their sialic acids for a variety of different purposes that play important roles in their ability to colonize and persist in organs of their hosts. For instance, sialic acids were shown to subvert immune clearance mechanisms by restricting complement C3b deposition on its surface [47] . Once synthesized, sialic acid residues in the capsular polysaccharide or oligosaccharide of E. coli K1, GBS serogroup III, N. meningitidis, one or more of the hydroxyl groups in positions 4, 7, 8, and 9 are substituted by acetyl groups [48] . Sia O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation is regulated by the gene neuD and neuA, respectively, to reach a final level of the surface expressed O-Ac-Sia modification [47, 49, 50] . In addition to neuD, which O-acetylates monomeric sialic acid, E. coli K1 strains harboring the prophage CUS-3 express neuO, a polysialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase [51, 52] . Expression of neuO is regulated by phase variation [53] . In E. coli K1 strains O-acetylation increases immunogenicity of the K1 capsule and correlates with increased virulence in patients [54] .

The function of parasite-associated 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for entry of promastigotes into macrophages has been demonstrated in comparison to the minimal internalization of de-O-acetylated promastigotes.

Additionally, increased presence of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids during metacyclic stages of virulent promastigotes has pointed to the direct correlation between the association of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids and virulence. Apart from being a marker of virulence, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids also play an important role in conferring nitric oxide resistance in virulent Leishmania sp. having enhanced distribution of the sialoglycotope. Furthermore they also influence the intracellular survival of the parasite within macrophages and modulate the host responses in their favor as evidenced by decreased level of IL-12 and IFN-g, the signature TH1 cytokines [81] . In contrast, macrophages show increased levels of these cytokines, when they are infected with de-O-acetylated promastigotes.

Expression of this sialyltransferase in breast cancer cells alleviates their migration into the brain by mediating cell passage through the blood-brain barrier [86] . In order to identify the functional impact of sialic acids, knockout mice with deleted sialyltransferase genes were created which exhibited a number of developmental changes.

This includes both the recognition of microbial structures by immune cells and the intricate crosstalk between immune cells. It was hypothesized that attachment to and invasion of microorganisms into host cells taking advantage of carbohydrate-lectin interactions had induced a selective pressure to modulate their carbohydrate structures and the respective lectin receptors in order to prevent infection or on the side of the microorganisms to counteract these alterations on the host's side [106] . By means of this putative evolutionary process the complexity of carbohydrate structures expressed on the cell surface might have developed. Interestingly, a majority of these protein-carbohydrate interactions depends on the presence of terminal sialic acids as decisive recognition elements of the oligosaccharide ligand. Accordingly there are at least two lectin families known, the selectins and the Siglecs, which are specialized in the recognition of sialoglycans in various anomeric linkage patterns [107, 108] .

For example, coronaviruses have adapted specialized hemagglutinins to attach to cell surface expressed O-acetylated sialoglycans and to destroy further the linkage using sialic acid specific O-acetylesterases by removing the respective O-acetyl group [64, [67] [68] [69] 109] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 219, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 715, "end": 720, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1234, "text": "[107,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1239, "text": "108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1689, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1694, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1704, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1709, "text": "109]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of O-Acetylated Sialic Acids in Immunological Processes"}, {"text": "When analyzing O-acetylation of lymphocytes it became evident that these immune cells preferentially synthesize 7-O-acetyl-and 9-O-acetyl sialoglycans [22, 32, [110] [111] [112] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "32,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 160, "end": 165, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 166, "end": 171, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 172, "end": 177, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of O-Acetylated Sialic Acids in Immunological Processes"}, {"text": "O-Acetylated sialic acids resulted in increased susceptibility to alternate complement pathway-mediated lysis of murine erythrocytes.

While at that time the mechanism of this possible inhibition was not clear, consecutive work may explain the mechanism. Nicoll et al. described that GD3 expressed on target cells is able to modulate NK cell cytotoxicity by interaction with Siglec-7 expressed on NK cells. Siglec-7 has a preference for binding of a2,8 linked disialo glycans and seems to be one of the inhibitory NK cell receptors [117] . In the case of melanoma cells the inhibitory function of GD3 could not be verified since GD3 expressed on melanoma cells can induce another class of cytotoxic cells, the NKT cells [118] . It was further elucidated that the fine specificity of GD3 reactive NKT cells is mediated by binding to CD1d, a surface molecule structurally related to the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) which is expressed on T cells. CD1d has a preference for carbohydrate ligands. It is not clear at the moment whether in the in vivo situation there may be a balance between anti-melanoma NK and NKT cellmediated immunity which affects the outcome of an effective immune surveillance in melanoma patients.

Tonsillar B lymphocytes, though to a smaller extent than T lymphocytes, express CD60b and c [22, 111] . Additionally the occurrence of CD60c was described on CD16+ NK cells, monocytes, and granulocytes to various extents [32] and on human CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow (Schwartz-Albiez, unpublished). Cell surface-expressed CD60b and c on T and B lymphocytes may have a functional role in the lymphocytic activation process because anti-CD60b and c monoclonal antibodies can influence lymphocytic proliferation [22, 32, 131 ]. An interesting observation was that T and B lymphocytes react towards stimulation with CD60b and c antibodies in a different way. While in T lymphocytes CD60c antibodies alone, like a mitogen, can stimulate proliferation in B cells, additional signals such as addition of the cytokine Il-4 and triggering of the B cell receptor (surface expressed immunoglobulin) are required. For stimulation with antibodies against CD60b in T and B lymphocytes, additional signals are required [22] . This differential behavior may have a basis in a different surface distribution of the 12 C. Mandal et al. antigens. While CD60b structures are found in dot-like formations, possibly as components of rafts, both in T and B cells, CD60c on T cells showed a more homogenous distribution on the cell surface [22] . It is most likely that CD60b is a cno-stimulatory signal for raft-concentrated receptors while CD60c in T cells acts as a mitogen.

The removal of O-acetyl groups by sodium salicylate in lymphoblasts re-establishes the GD3-responsiveness to apoptotic signals.

Intracellular GD3 is involved in CD95-and ceramide-mediated apoptosis [133] . Upon receptor-triggering, de novo synthesized GD3 accumulates intracellularly which can be demonstrated by increased activity of GD3 synthase. GD3 as a rule is restricted to be present in the Golgi network and at the plasma membrane it is transferred to mitochondria via endosomal transport [134] to raft-like mitochondrial membrane domains [135] . The mechanisms of GD3-induced apoptosis can be traced back to a GD3-mediated change in the mitochondrial membrane potential and consequently increased production of reactive oxygen species [136, 137] . Oxidation of GD3 to GD3-7-aldehyde was shown to increase the apoptotic effect by targeting adenine nucleotide translocase [138] . O-Acetylation of GD3 suppresses this pro-apoptotic function of non-acetylated GD3 and does not have the deleterious effects of GD3 on mitochondria membranes [132] . Cells which are resistant to overexpression of GD3 convert existing GD3 more readily to 9-O-acetylated GD3 [132] . In further confirmation of the anti-apoptotic effects of O-acetylated GD3, Kniep et al. found that exogenous O-acetylated GD3 given to cells in vitro is internalized and can prevent apoptosis [139] . It was also observed that a T leukemia cell line resistant to apoptosis induced by N-acetyl-sphingosine or daunorubicin Functions and Biosynthesis of O-Acetylated Sialic Acids 13 transferred GD3 more readily into 9-O-acetyl GD3 [139] . Targetting 9-Oacetylated GD3 with sialate-9-O-acetylesterase results in apoptosis of biopsyderived human glioblastoma cells. Compared to treatment of cells with exogenous O-acetylesterase, the effect of de-O-acetylation is more pronounced when the esterase is expressed within the cells from a recombinant baculovirus vector [127] . Thus, these data strongly point to an anti-apoptototic function of intracellular 9-O-acetyl GD3 that may protect tumor cells from apoptosis.

At least two forms of cellular 9-O-acetyl-SIAE, one in the cytoplasm and the other in the lysosomal compartment (i.e., membrane-bound), exist in mammals. The secreted form, originally termed luminal sialic acid esterase [191, 192] , was later termed lysosomal sialic acid O-acetylesterase (Lse) [193] , because it was shown by immuno-electron microscopy to co-localize with acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins [191] . This SIAE contains a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and is secreted from COS cells as a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa [193] , whereas in rat liver it is found predominantly as a heterodimer composed of a small (28-kDa) and large (38-kDa) subunit connected by disulfide bridges. The small subunit could be labeled with the serine hydrolase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that SIAE is a serine esterase. No sequence similarities to other known serine esterases were found [192] . Amino acid residues, important for catalytic activity and secretion, were determined by expression of mutated cDNA. The mutations tested were found in the SIAE gene of patients with autoimmune disease [124] . Both subunits are encoded by the same mRNA in the order signal sequence -small subunit -large subunit. The precursor is presumably cleaved in lysosomal compartments [192, 194] . SIAE was identified independently by another research team as cDNA derived from a gene that is upregulated during B cell maturation. Several cDNAs were isolated which apparently are derived from differentially spliced SIAE mRNA [195] . One of the spliced mRNAs is lacking the exon for the signal sequence and encodes the cytosolic SIAE. While the mRNA for the secreted SIAE is widely expressed in different adult tissues, the expression of the cytosolic SIAE is restricted. Elevated expression of the latter was found mainly in liver, ovary, and brain [196] .

Concerning the function of SIAE, many open questions remain. While it can be envisaged that cytosolic SIAE is involved in de-O-acetylation of O-Ac-Sias delivered from lysosomes, the function of the \"lysosomal\" SIAE remains controversial due to the unfavorable pH in lysosomes. The pH optimum of SIAE is in the neutral to alkaline range. Data indicate that intracellular vesicles exist which contain mannose-6-phosphate positive glycoproteins [191] . Such entities possibly represent transport vesicles on the way from the Golgi to lysosomes. In any case, precise models of how SIAE is involved in tuning the balance of O-acetylation of sialic acids are currently not available. Consequently, a large field is open for future investigations. Another question concerns the enzymatic activity of secreted SIAE, which was shown to be increased upon proteolytic cleavage [193] . The protease required for cleavage activation was proposed to be a lysosomal enzyme, but the nature of this protease remains to be determined. Moreover, it is apparently not a common protease. COS cells were shown to express and secrete the uncleaved SIAE [193] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 142, "text": "[162,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 143, "end": 148, "text": "[187]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 149, "end": 154, "text": "[188]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 155, "end": 160, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 161, "end": 166, "text": "[190]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 389, "end": 394, "text": "[191,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "192]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 464, "end": 469, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 596, "end": 601, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 753, "end": 758, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1129, "text": "[192]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1338, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1511, "text": "[192,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1516, "text": "194]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1752, "text": "[195]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2076, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2181, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2261, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2308, "end": 2313, "text": "[197]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2319, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2325, "text": "[199]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2331, "text": "[200]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2361, "text": "[201]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2470, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2528, "end": 2533, "text": "[202]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3062, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3481, "end": 3486, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3745, "end": 3750, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sialate-O-Acetylesterase"}, {"text": "Another puzzle remains concerning the distribution of the secreted SIAE. Available data indicate that it is intracellularly concentrated in lysosomal compartments [191] . On the other hand it is efficiently secreted into the culture supernatant of cells over-expressing SIAE, and therefore it has access to O-Ac-Sias at the cell surface [193, 195] . Furthermore, the substrate specificity was shown for O-acetyl groups on free sialic acids [193] . In Siae knockout mice, an increase in a2,6-linked O-Ac-Sias was observed by using the influenza C virus lectin [123] . Strictly speaking, the influenza C virus lectin binds to any accessible O-Ac-Sia regardless of the underlying linkage. Thus, it remains an open question whether a2,3or a2,8linked sialic acids are also de-O-acetylated by SIAE. Furthermore, no SIAE hydrolyzing Neu4,5Ac 2 has been purified to homogeneity allowing the Functions and Biosynthesis of O-Acetylated Sialic Acids determination of its relationship to SIAE specific for Neu5,9Ac 2 .
