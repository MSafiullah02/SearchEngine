Compared to the prototype EP3, 26 point mutations at the nucleotide level were found in p7 and p15, which cause 25 amino acid substitutions (Table 1\n). An additional amino acid substitution (G405\u2013D405) was accumulated at p35, which was also fixed at p50 and p65. In addition, the amino acid residue at position 246 was mutated from I246\u2013T246 in p7, p15, p35, and p50 (Table 1). This amino acid was found to be mutated to S246 in p65 (Table 1). These results indicated that the selection process or accumulation of mutations was largely accomplished and fixed at p7, suggesting that adaptation of IBV from chicken embryo to a monkey kidney cell line either induces rapid and dramatic changes in the S protein or leads to rapid selection of a fitter variant.",

            "text": "To test whether the rapid emergency of a Vero cell-adapted strain that grows well and becomes dominant after as short as seven passages on Vero cells is due to the accumulation of mutations or by selection of pre-existing minor variants, viral RNA was purified from the amniotic fluid of chicken embryos infected with chicken embryo passage 2. The S protein region was then amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into PCR-2.1-TOPO vector. Twenty-seven clones were randomly selected and sequenced. As shown in Table 2\n, sequence heterogeneity of S protein was observed. Among the 27 clones sequenced, 21 (77.8%) clones (EP3) show identical sequence to the EP3 sequence shown in Table 1 at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. Two (7.4%) clones (EP3V1) have differences at 13 amino acid positions in the S1 region from amino acids 38 to 181 (Table 2). Interestingly, these 13 amino acids are identical to the amino acid sequences of the dominant p7 and later passages at the same positions as listed in Table 1. Four more clones with amino acid differences in the S2 region were also identified from this analysis. As can be seen, two clones (7.4%) (EP3V2) were found to have mutations at seven amino acid positions in the S2 region from amino acids 623 to 1012 (Table 2). The other two clones (7.4%) (EP3V3) with mutations at five amino acid positions in the same region were also found (Table 2). These mutations are identical to mutations found at the same positions in the dominant p7 and later passages as listed in Table 1. These results suggest that the dominant Vero cell-adapted virus may be derived by recombination between the two minor variants, EP3V1 and EP3V2, in chicken embryo with accumulation of seven additional mutations in the region from amino acids 246 to 391.",

Among these clones, 10 out of 11 (91%) have the identical mutations as the dominant p7 listed in Table 1, which carry 18 (p20) amino acid substitutions in the S1 region and 7 in the S2 region. Interestingly, one unique isolate from each passage (p20c22 and p36c12) has the identical S protein sequence as the minor variant EP3V2, except with an unchanged Phe residue at amino acid position 692 (Table 2). These results showed that the virus population remained to be a quasispecies even after successful adaptation to the new host cells. It also indicates that the five mutations in the S2 region are sufficient for the variant to acquire infectivity and cell-to-cell membrane fusion of Vero cells. As both variants grow well and induce syncytial formation [16], it is reasonable to assume that the variants without mutations in the S1 region could bind to receptor(s) and enter the new host cells (see Table 2).",

As shown in Fig. 2A, both EP3 and p65 can infect UMNSAH/DF1 cells, but the infected cells showed different CPE. In cells infected with EP3, cell rounding up and lysis are the prominent CPE observed; the infected areas were usually restricted (Fig. 2\nA). In cells infected with p65, the prominent CPE is the formation of large syncytial cells (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed the detection of N protein in cells infected with EP3 and p65, respectively (Fig. 2B). Gradually increased detection of the N protein in cells infected with EP3 was observed over a time-course experiment (Fig. 2B, lanes 1\u20135). Interestingly, more efficient detection of the N protein was observed in cells infected with p65 (Fig. 2B, lane 6). As the Vero cell-adapted IBV strain can also efficiently infect chicken embryo [16], these results suggest that mutations in the S protein broaden the host range specificity of IBV and might increase the infectivity of the virus to its original host cells.",

This high mutation rate results in the formation of a heterogeneous population, often described as a quasispecies [6]. When switching to a new host, the pre-existing quasispecies with a mixed population of RNA genomes would enable these viruses to respond very quickly to the changing environment. High mutation rates per generation coupled with the change of host cells would then help to fix the mutations. In this report, we test the adaptability of avian coronaviruses IBV from its native chicken host to monkey cells through serial passages. After adaptation, more than 53.06% (26/49) of mutations were located in the S gene which caused amino acid changes. More interestingly, the majority of these mutations were fixed as early as at passage 7 to form a dominant Vero cell-adapted strain. The highly selective and concentrative mutations in the S protein support that S gene and its product play important roles in viral acquisition of a new host, and that beneficial mutations in S protein are required for virus to enter the new target cells and spread infection.",

            "text": "How is this dominant strain derived? Evidence presented in this report supports that it may be derived by selection of pre-existing minor variants and by recombination between minor variants. The selective pressure in this case was the initial low infectivity of the virus to a new host cell and the lack of membrane fusion of the virus during the first few passages. Several blind passages on Vero cells were needed before the viral RNA became detectable and typical CPE appeared. The detection of single, isolated infected cells at p1 suggested that pre-existing minor variants in the prototype population could enter the new host cell and replicate though at low efficiency. The existence of minor variants was confirmed by sequencing of viral RNA extracted from EP3 and by isolation of minor variants in p20 and p36. Interestingly, the minor variants isolated from p20 and p36 share almost identical sequence with one minor variant (EP3V1) identified in EP3. The fact that these minor variants co-exist with the dominant strains long after the virus was well adapted to the new host cells demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of the quasispecies. More importantly, comparison of the amino acid sequences of EP3V1 and EP3V2 with the dominant Vero cell-adapted strain suggests that the dominant Vero cell-adapted strain may be derived by a recombination event between EP3V1 and EP3V2, and by simultaneous accumulation of a few more mutations.",

            "text": "Coronavirus S protein is an important determinant for host specificity and tissue tropism. This is largely determined by the cellular distribution and abundance of its receptor(s). A diverse group of cellular proteins has been identified as receptors for different coronaviruses, including angiotensin-converting enzyme II and CD209L (L-SIGN) for SARS-CoV [8], [10], aminopeptidase N for human coronavirus-229E, porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and canine coronavirus [5], [22], and carcioembryonic antigen-related adhesion molecule for mouse hepatitis virus [21]. To date, the cellular receptor(s) for IBV has not been identified in its native or adapted host cells. Based on studies with other coronaviruses [14], [18], the receptor binding domain of IBV S protein may also reside in the S1 region. Mutations in the S1 region would change receptor-binding properties of the S protein and be responsible for the broadened host range specificity of the Vero cell-adapted virus, presumably due to its increased binding affinity to the receptor. Intriguingly, the two minor variants, p20c22 and p36c12, have almost identical amino acid sequence in the S1 region to the dominant EP3 strains, and showed similar growth properties to the dominant Vero cell-adapted strain after purified by plaque-purification [16], suggesting that receptor-binding affinity alone may not be the only factor that determined the host range of the virus. It also indicates that a mammalian counterpart could be used as a receptor for IBV, though at low affinity. This molecule may share structural and functional similarity with that of the native receptor on chicken cells.",

This membrane-fusion activity is mainly associated with domains in the S2 region [1], though residues in the S1 region may also be involved [19]. The minor variant EP3V1 has only 7 amino acid difference in the S1 region from the dominant Vero cell-adapted strain and would have a comparatively higher binding affinity to Vero cells than the other minor variant EP3V2. As no amino acid mutations were accumulated in the S2 region, this minor variant was lost during adaptation of EP3 to Vero cells. However, EP3V2 shares seven amino acid substitutions in the S2 region but with identical S1 region with the dominant EP3, it co-adapted with the dominant Vero cell-adapted strain until p36. As some of these mutations are located in the heptad repeat 1 and 2 region, these mutations may alter the fusogenic properties of the S protein. It suggests that the ability to mediate membrane fusion is also important for IBV to cross this species barrier. Recombination between EP3V1 and EP3V2 plus accumulation of several additional mutations in the S1 region led to the formation of the dominant Vero cell-adapted IBV. This virus shows a broadened host range specificity and can induce efficient cell\u2013cell fusion in the new host cells.",
