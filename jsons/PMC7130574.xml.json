While there has been a change in the range of actors delivering those services, the most important reform has been observed in the tools and forms of service delivery. Today public agencies are not the only providers of services that traditionally used to be or were considered \u2018public\u2019: non-profit and for-profit agencies as well as ordinary citizens have become the stakeholders and actors taking on the roles and responsibilities of service provision at all stages of the process. The notion that embraces the processes and activities of all those inter-dependent actors is known and advocated today as governance.",

Governance has become one of the main tools to address complex and multi-faceted societal issues today. One of such fields is emergency management, which has experienced substantial changes over the past years especially due to the increased impacts of disasters on the society. It is impossible to imagine emergency management today as a field comprising agencies acting on their own; governments at all levels seek and establish partnerships, whether formal or informal, to tackle issues of complex nature. This article briefly describes the notion of governance and how the concept is practiced in the field of emergency management in the context of urban/metropolitan environments. An example of the Orlando Metropolitan Area in the State of Florida is provided to show how governance has become an indispensable part of today\u2019s emergency management practices.",

Specifically, it is a consensus-oriented and deliberative process (Ansell & Gash, 2007) with shared decision-making (Freeman & Peck, 2007) directed towards shaping and influencing a public policy (Klijn & Koppenjan, 2000).",

Governance networks require organizations to work collaboratively to solve common problems and reach convergent organizational goals. This may lead to fuzzy organizational boundaries (Stoker, 1998). Additionally, organizations operating in governance networks strengthen their connections with multiple relationships (Milward and Provan, 2000, Rhodes, 1996). Collaborative relationships are products of joined efforts for reaching common goals, combined resources, shared decision making, and accountability for final product (Kamensky, Burlin, & Abramson, 2004). In the simplest sense, collaboration is a set of activities directed towards the achievement of \u201ccommon goals, often working across boundaries and in multi-sector and multi-actor relationships\u201d (Agranoff & McGuire, 2003, p. 4).",

In fact, he claims, cooperation is a stronger aspect of metropolitan governance that researchers should focus on, which is the binding glue of all inter-organizational relationships at the metropolitan level. Ahrens and Rudolph (2006), in turn, argue that governance should be applied across all levels of government including community and local levels, with specific focus on the capacity-building of respective governments. Effective disaster management at these levels is argued to be possible through the implementation of governance elements including accountability, participation, predictability, and transparency. These aspects of governance should be the main factors shaping and determining inter-organizational relationships among the different sectors and levels of government. Overall, though, all these values and capacities should be the contributors to disaster resilient urban communities that, according to Pierce, Budd, and Lovrich (2011), should be able to absorb change-producing disturbances comprising including natural disasters and emergencies.",

The September 11 attacks showed the limits of government organizations in emergency management (Comfort, 2002). Public organizations from different levels of the government, private sector organizations, nonprofits, individuals and community organizations have been components of the emergency management system. However, there are distinctions between rural and urban environments which require different resources and knowledge in each setting. The complexity of urban settings requires; additional attention and a denser set of relationships between stakeholders of the emergency management mechanisms, more in depth analysis of conditions before, during, and after a disaster, and creates further complication in the decision making mechanism (Comfort and Kapucu, 2006, Petak, 1985). Citizens, advocacy groups, private organizations, nonprofits, and public organizations from various backgrounds are part of the system, which adds complexity while providing a larger amount of opportunities for public managers to use in effective management of emergencies (Kapucu & Ozerdem, 2011).",

Her approach requires a sound, appropriate, and flexible information infrastructure in maintaining organizational tasks. Information infrastructures and networks are critical to making timely decisions. Lack of information networks and a clear flow of information inevitably lead to the collapse of sense making (Weick, 1993). Complex systems also refer to emergent and self-organizing groups such as individual responders and nonprofits. Effective information sharing in times of disasters is critical for managing self-organizing groups and channeling them in the appropriate tasks. Complex systems embedded in cities, and the potential scope of emergent groups, during disasters draw significant attention to urban emergency management systems.",

In turn, local and regional capacities should be enhanced, since it is mostly at this level that metropolitan emergency management is based and operates. Metropolitan emergency management is and should be an arena for inter-organizational arrangements directed towards the collaboration and coordination of disaster and emergency management activities. With overlapping claims, Andrew (2009) argues that the nature of inter-organizational networked governance is mostly the function of the characteristics of services and goods sought to be collaboratively delivered. Simo and Bies (2007) use the collaborative public management paradigm and cross-sector collaboration to examine role of nonprofits in Hurricane Katrina. They used Bryson, Crosby, and Stone (2006) framework for cross sector collaboration to examine the nonprofits\u2019 behavior in response to Katrina. In their research, they found that nonprofit involvement in cross-sector collaboration was critical particularly important when administrative failures were overwhelming and there were difficulties in meeting the daily needs of citizens during and after the disaster.",

Partnerships were instrumental in the ultimate success of emergency management during and after this disaster. Local capacity, however, is mostly concentrated within county-level governments (Waugh, 1994). Waugh (1994) argues that county-level metropolitan governance is the most suitable system for dealing with disasters, especially due to its proximity to sub-level and upper level government, a larger pool of resources, and the use of forums for inter-organizational arrangements at the local level. In addition, such mechanisms are clear of command-and-control structures and favor a more collaborative and cooperative perspective to disaster and emergency management (Kapucu & Ozerdem, 2011).",

Their study points to the importance of previous experience, in terms of collaborative practices, for producing more effective results. On the other hand, considering a study on the urban governance of emergency and disaster management of bushfires in Sydney, Australia, Gillen (2005) finds that emergency management governance is effective to the extent that it is inclusive and participatory. Accordingly, it is not only institutional arrangements but the extent to which citizens are involved in the governance process that creates success. The author claims that resistance to collaborative approaches among related organizations as well as community stakeholders would result in non-resilient communities. Godschalk (2003) similarly argues that resilient cities are those with collaborative emergency management governance embracing all sectors and levels of government, proactive in nature, fostered by strong leadership, and based on continuous learning. The author claims that metropolitan emergency management governance is not an issue of one-step reforms but that of long-term efforts of continuous institutional adjustments for collaborative arrangements.",

In other words, it is important to make related practical adjustments based on socially emerging needs in times of disasters rather than ignoring them. A closely related study is by Savitch (2008), which focuses on terrorism in the context of cities and claims that urban environments possess two characteristics, namely vulnerability and resilience. The main claim of the author is that while cities are more vulnerable to man-made disasters like terrorism, resilience is the key factor in balancing the negative consequences, which is sustained through political order.

In other words, collaborative and networked relationships constitute the core of the urban/metropolitan emergency management. Multi-level, cross-sector, and inter-jurisdictional relationships are considered a must for today\u2019s urban emergency management governance. Secondly, these relationships are claimed to be effective only if the local capacity is strong and developed with all stakeholders ready in terms of the strategic and technical aspects. In a sense resilient urban communities are those that are prepared with enhanced capacity. Thirdly, there is an emphasis on leadership and political will that would create, foster and enhance an environment of cooperation rather than competition, especially due to the sensitivity of the emergency management context. Lastly, there is an intense stress on the characteristics of networked relationships, set apart by flexibility, transparency, participation, and accountability. These factors impact not only the effectiveness and efficiency, but also the legitimacy of the overall emergency management governance process.",

Related changes in this approach are described in the following sections, and lastly present a case for exemplification purposes. Collaborative governance has already become a wide practice across several fields of public administration. Emergency management is one of such fields relying on inter-sector and inter-governmental arrangements to effectively deal with emergencies and disasters (Waugh & Streib, 2006). This urge has been especially substantiated by the increased severity and scope of disasters, which has shown how government agencies responsible for responding to disasters are no longer capable of doing the job on their own (Bier, 2006). The complex issues so much inherent in emergency management become unmanageable with traditional tools characterized by hierarchical structures, rigid organizational boundaries and extensive red tape (Kapucu, 2008, Kapucu and Van Wart, 2006). The overwhelming nature of disasters, bringing about uncertainty and complexity, makes it imperative to collaborate with other actors and stakeholders through collective decision-making and action (Kapucu & Garayev, 2011).",

The paradigm shift experienced can be summoned in the gradual transitions from non-involvement strategies to coordination policies and from coordination policies to collaborative governance. The former transition roughly covers the second half of the 20th century when the national government increased its presence through the establishment of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1979 and subsequent reforms to implement an all-hazard approach to emergency management.

While the FRP was a national design describing how the federal government would act to support state and local efforts, it was modeled at the lower levels of government to standardize inter-governmental operations and coordination (FEMA, 1992). The FRP was replaced by a more comprehensive National Response Plan (NRP) in 2004 after the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. The NRP was a combination of all previous plans and strategies with a goal to fix inter-agency coordination and communication problems experienced during the September 11, 2011 terrorist attacks. The NRP came with a set of policy adjustments and standardizations which were embodied in the National Incident Management System (NIMS) envisioning a coordinated, unified and streamlined effort to deal with all types of disasters, and focusing on the capacity of collaborative arrangements between representatives of different sectors and levels of government. The inclusion of for-profit and non-profit sectors in the overall collaborative framework was an additional development to note (DHS, 2008).",

Being a more universal and less fragile in nature, this cluster approach is very limited in terms of capacities and opportunities the ESF-based ICS template offers. One should note that the American system is more or less effective at the lower levels of governments, the community level, or local level, especially because of its ability to be flexible and manageable only at this level. Thus, the systems that would replicate the American approach should target its use mostly at the local level, where coordination is needed the most.",

The literature suggests that urban/metropolitan emergency management today has become an arena for collaborative practices with a stress on local capacity building for effective results. Much of what happens at local level is an example of the multi-level networked governance of inter-organizational relationships directed towards a common goal in the context of emergency management. Investment into local capacity that would nurture networked governance oriented structures is important from practical point of view. Meanwhile, the way emergency management networks are shaped should be locality-specific and needs-based. Also emphasized is the need to apply and strengthen governance characteristics such as participation, flexibility, accountability and transparency in the context of urban/metropolitan emergency management.",
