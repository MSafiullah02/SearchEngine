A localized JH may be seen in some professions [1], or a generalized one which usually results from a congenital disease or acquired conditions. Whereas the latter is common among athletes [2], congenital JH may be an indicator of potentially threatening connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) in particular, though most patients appear with no signs of further serious conditions.",

JH and some of these features define the picture of the so-called joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), a wide-spectrum clinical condition that is often hard to diagnose. It is a challenge to assess the frequency of JHS in the general population; the undefined signs, the lack of specific laboratory findings, but also the patients\u2019 difficulty in describing their symptoms make it easy to underestimate or overlook this clinical picture. Moreover the syndrome is very similar \u2013 sometimes identical - to the more common variant of EDS hypermobility type (EDS-HT) (rev in [10\u201312]).",

Hypermobility can be measured with a standardized method but the main problem is how to relate hypermobile patients to the clinical entity. The Beighton hypermobility score [13] is the most widely used system for rating hypermobility of the peripheral joints and spine (Fig. 1) and even if it does not consider pauci-articular conditions or other sites, such as the foot, it can detect the majority of cases. The Brighton criteria [14], which incorporate the Beighton score as well as the main symptoms and phenotypic features, are used to diagnose JHS (Table 1). A very effective five-point questionnaire was recently proposed by Hakim and Grahame to evaluate JH [15] (Table 2).",

In 2008, when she was 14, she had developed Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon which was promptly evaluated by a rheumatologist and classified as a primary condition on the basis of a completely normal capillaroscopy and complete blood tests. The year after this, while the patient was in the United States, she caught first of all SARS flu, and then Epstein-Barr virus which resulted in a long period of persistent asthenia that kept her bedridden for some months.",

The worst episode was a neck trauma due to a severe skiing fall which caused an inversion of the natural cervical spine lordosis. This worsened the patient\u2019s fatigue and aggravated the diffuse arthralgia. Gradually the previous symptoms were joined by lower limb paresthesia and in 2011 she was investigated for a suspected neurological or muscle disease (brain MRI, four-limbs EMG), but the result was negative. Also negative was MRI of the entire spine, a total body bone scan, and a skull and jaws X-ray carried out at short intervals. She was seen twice by rheumatologists, and both concluded with a diagnosis of fibromyalgic syndrome even if there was no subsequent confirmation at rheumatology control visits.",

She reported a weight gain of about 15 kg in the last 8 months, which she explained by the interruption of physical activities. She reported variable abdominal discomfort, alternating bowel and sometimes difficult urination, with dysuria and pollakiuria although she had no urinary infections.
