There are, however, other potential sources of evidence on how crime changes during sudden and widespread changes to routine activities.",

            "text": "Several scholars have studied changes in crime during and after natural disasters, particularly Atlantic hurricanes (Elmes et al. 2014). Disasters cause widespread changes to routine activities through deaths, evacuations and disruption of working and leisure patterns, as well as through damage to the physical environment. Lebeau (2002) and Frailing and Harper (2017) found increases in burglaries in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes in the United States, possibly due to more properties being unattended if residents have evacuated or been hospitalized (Leitner and Helbich 2011). Studies of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina found an increase in homicide, possibly due to the disruption and subsequent informal reorganization of drug markets (Frailing and Harper 2017). However, Roman et al. (2007) found that violence more generally in New Orleans actually fell after Katrina, before rising to a higher level than before the hurricane. Leitner et al. (2011) found that violence was broadly stable in other Louisiana parishes hit by the storm. Varano et al. (2010) studied violent and non-violent crime rates in cities that hosted large numbers of Katrina evacuees and found no widespread or pervasive changes. Prelog (2016), studying associations between crime and the frequency and severity of natural disasters at the county level, found disasters were associated with higher property crime but no change in violence. For further discussion of crime in the context of natural disasters, see Frailing and Harper (2017).",

These affect routine activities by bringing large numbers of people into the event area, disrupting traffic and public transport, and gathering people to watch the event on television. As with crime during natural disasters, studies of crime during major events have produced mixed results. Campaniello (2013) found that the football World Cup was associated with increases across several types of property crime (including burglary and pick-pocketing), while Kurland et al. (2014) concluded large football matches at Wembley Stadium in London were associated with increases in both violent crime and theft in the immediate area. However, Breetzke and Cohn (2013) found no city-wide increase in violence associated with football matches and no increase in burglary even in the neighborhood of the stadium. Baumann et al. (2012) reported that a city hosting the Olympic Games was associated with a 10% increase in property crime, but hosting the Super Bowl was associated with a 2.5% decrease in violence. For a recent discussion of crime associated with major sporting events, see Piquero et al. (2019).",

These types were:Serious assaults in public places including homicides and aggravated assaults in commercial, leisure, retail and transportation settings as well as in public open spaces and streets.Serious assaults in residences including homicides and aggravated assaults in houses, apartments etc but excluding institutional residential settings such as hospitals, hotels and prisons.Residential burglaries (excluding auto burglaries) occurring in residences, excluding institutional residences.Non-residential burglaries (excluding auto burglaries) occurring anywhere other than a residence.Theft of vehiclesTheft from vehicles including auto burglaries and thefts of auto parts.",

            "text": "Understanding relationships between COVID-19 and crime requires some estimate of how much crime would be expected to occur in the absence of the pandemic. This is difficult because so many factors influence how much crime occurs. A number of media outlets have attempted to understand changes in crime during the pandemic by making week-to-week or year-on-year comparisons of weekly or monthly crime counts. However, these comparisons risk drawing false conclusions because they ignore long-term trends (which affect year-on-year comparisons) and seasonal variations (which complicate week to week comparisons). Perhaps most importantly, these comparisons take no account of random variation, even though crime counts over short periods typically show a relatively large amount of statistical noise (Gorr et al. 2003). For example, on 27 March The Washington Post reported that both burglaries and assaults in New York City had dropped by 18% compared to the previous week (Jacobs and Devlin 2020). But across the 16 cities for which data were available for the current study, the absolute week-to-week change in burglary was greater than 18% in an average of 16 weeks each year between 2016 and 2019 and the absolute change in serious assaults greater than 18% in an average of 20 weeks each year. That apparently newsworthy changes in crime are actually commonplace might help explain why 6 days later on 2 April, the New York Post was able to report that felonies in New York City had increased 12% year-on-year \u201cdespite coronavirus\u201d (McCarthy, 2020).",

            "text": "The SARIMA models were used to forecast how many crimes in each category would be expected to occur in each city in the weeks after 20 January 2020 in the absence of the virus or any other change in crime trends. These forecasts acted as a synthetic comparison group against which to compare the actual frequency of crime during the pandemic. Due to the large number of such comparisons (one for each crime type in each city in each week), some actual frequencies would be expected to be different from the forecast frequency by chance. Controlling for this (for example by adjusting the significance threshold) is not straightforward, since the data are temporally autocorrelated. For the purposes of this analysis, actual crime counts outside the 99% confidence interval (rather than the more conventional 95%) of the forecast crime count were considered to be significantly different to the expected count of crime in the absence of the virus, but only if the actual count was outside the confidence interval for at least two consecutive weeks. While it is not possible to exclude other sources of variation that may have occurred at the same time as the beginning of the pandemic, it is unlikely that any change unrelated to the virus would occur simultaneously in all the cities under study.",

This approach was not used here because the coronavirus pandemic was a slow-onset emergency that may have a relationship to crime that changes over time (Frailing and Harper 2017). Interrupted time series designs are not appropriate in such circumstances because they assume that a clear distinction can be made between crimes occurring before and after the event under study (Kontopantelis et al. 2015). Such designs also provide only a single overall measure of the relationship between crime and an external event, whereas it is important to be able to identify evolving relationships caused by, for example, people adjusting to a new normal as an emergency unfolds (Varano et al. 2010).",

Further research into this question may need to explore any changes in who is involved in serious assaults during the pandemic. Since serious violence is known to be concentrated among a small number of persistent offenders and repeat victims (Jennings et al. 2012), and that offenders who commit serious offences are also more likely to commit minor infractions such as breaching stay-at-home orders (Roach 2018), it may be that those involved in serious assaults were no less likely to be on the streets during the pandemic than before. Future research should also look at the types of public place in which assaults have occurred: it may be that during the pandemic public assaults were displaced from those facilities seeing fewer people (such as retail malls) to those seeing more (such as parks).",

In Chicago and Los Angeles, these reductions began during the week in which schools closed and stay-at-home orders were issued in those cities and were sustained each week afterwards. This means that, for example, in the 4 weeks after a stay-at-home order was issued in Chicago, there were approximately 940 fewer residential burglaries than would have been expected based on the model forecast.

Much criminological research draws conclusions based on data from only one city (Ashby 2019), but obtaining a robust understanding of any relationships in the present case\u2014and of the limitations of those relationships\u2014is likely to require data from multiple cities or other areas.
