In particular, pneumonia is responsible for approximately 1.4\u20131.8 million fatal cases in children under age five globally [2]. Beyond the mortality burden, there is significant morbidity with symptomatic viral infections estimated at more than five episodes per year in children under age three [3]. While single viral infections are relatively straightforward, there is interest in understanding the role of dual respiratory infections in pediatric patients. Dual infections could either be viral-viral or viral-bacterial as the human respiratory tract is a reservoir for many organisms.",

The younger the patient, the less likely a pathogen positive episode was asymptomatic (p = 0.01); in addition, multiple pathogens were found in significantly less asymptomatic episodes (p = 0.02). Further studies attempted to discern which viruses were more likely to cause symptoms. One study in children under age 5 years old found that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) were more likely to be causative of disease [8]. Another study still found high rates of asymptomatic shedding of RSV and PIV with more than half of positive tests associated with an asymptomatic patient [9]. However, within these data, younger patients were associated with higher rates of positive test results correlating with a symptomatic event demonstrating the importance of age in clinical manifestation of viral infections.",

Infection with RSV is one of the leading causes of death in children under 1 year of age worldwide, second only to malaria [10]. In a surveillance of acute respiratory infections in children under age 5, RSV was responsible for 20% of annual hospitalizations, 18% of emergency department visits, and 15% of office visits [11]. In an evaluation of children under 18 years old admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia, the most common cause of infection, whether bacterial or viral, was RSV quickly followed by rhinovirus [12]. Rhinovirus is the most common cause of respiratory viral illness during all seasons except winter when RSV is predominant [13]. Rhinovirus is second only to RSV in causing bronchiolitis in hospitalized patients [14]. Unfortunately, the true burden of rhinovirus is under-reported as many studies do not include this virus in there molecular diagnostic testing as the rates of asymptomatic shedding are quite high and it is difficult to differentiate shedding from actual cause of disease [13].",

It is postulated that the sequence of infections, the time interval between viral exposure, and the route of infection affect the pathogenicity of the co-infection [22]. One example of this used mice models. When the mice cell models that were infected with rhinovirus were then infected with influenza A virus 2 days later, there was an attenuated response to the influenza infection with less severe manifestation of disease [23]. This demonstrates that the preceding infection altered the host response and the timing and order of infection of the host are crucial in outward disease manifestation.",

For example, rhinovirus is a rapidly replicating virus and can interfere with the replication of other viruses while PIV is an extremely slow replicator and its replication can be interrupted by the presence of other viruses [22]. Viral loads can be compared among patients with one or multiple infections. One study found that viral loads were consistently high regardless of co-infection status (such as RSV, influenza A, and HMPV) but others had viral load vary based on co-infection status (such as PIV1 and adenovirus) [24]. Of these viruses, influenza A is least likely to be identified in co-infected patients. In mathematical modeling, the idea of resource competition can explain viral loads as the faster-replicating viruses overcome slower replicating viruses by leaving no resources [25]. In this model, influenza A replicates faster than RSV and therefore keeps the RSV viral load below detection level.",

In this review, viral co-infections did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: mean length of stay, length of supplemental oxygen, need for hospitalization, need for intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. They also looked at sub-analyses of specific viral combinations and did not see any influence on outcomes. Lim et al. [68] did a systemic review for children under age 5 years with respiratory illness and found insufficient evidence to suggest a difference in any clinical outcome based on co-infected status. In a very small subset of patients, they found a suggestion that children without co-morbidities actually did worse when only a single virus was identified. Goka et al. [55] did a systemic review of patients of all ages with respiratory illnesses and found that studies that recruited young children were more likely to report high rates of co-infection and that there were inconclusive results on risk of hospitalization or ICU admission.",

Examples include: Influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae and adenovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [26, 28].Disruption of the epithelium barrier: viruses can intracellularly disarrange cellular processes or destroy infected cells through metabolic exhaustion or lysis [26]. The destruction of cells leads to the denuding of the epithelial layer, exposing the basement membrane; therefore, causing introduction of bacterial organisms [29, 30]. Examples of this mechanism are S. pneumoniae binding to fibronectin after the denudation of the epithelium layer, and Staphylococcus aeurus and Morexella catarrhalis binding to extracellular matrix protein after destruction to the epithelium [31\u201333]. Loss of the epithelium integrity and promotion of bacterial translocation are also seen in rhinovirus-induced paracellular migration of Haemophilus influenzae [34].Upregulation of adhesion proteins: viral infected cells may decrease the innate immune response by altering the expression of antimicrobial peptides (defensins), which are secreted in the respiratory mucosa [35]. During viral infections, there are cascades of pro-inflammatory responses leading to the upregulation of adhesion proteins found on epithelial cells, which leads to the cellular invasion of pathogenic organisms [26]. For example, RSV and parainfluenza viruses upregulate intracellular and outer membranes proteins such as intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P5-homologous fimbriae (P5 fimbriae), carcinoembryonic adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM-1), and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr) [36, 37]. With the expression of these proteins, several bacterial organisms, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, are able to adhere to these molecules leading to invasion of the host\u2019s cells [36, 37].Production of viral factors: production of viral components such as neuramindase (NA), a glycoprotein produced by influenza and parainfluenza, and protein-G\u2014expressed on RSV cells\u2014destroy the integrity of infected cells. This destruction exposes bacterial receptors and aids in bacterial co-infections [38\u201341].Dysfunction of immune system components: respiratory viruses may affect the immune system by impairing neutrophil function, decreasing oxidative burst, and enhancing neutrophil apoptosis, thus increasing the susceptibility to bacterial superinfection [42, 43]. Also, viruses can predispose to bacteria superinfection by rendering natural killer (NK) cells recruitment and activation ineffective, which is seen with influenza and S. pneumoniae [44]. Viruses also alter monocyte function, decrease production and activity of cytokines, and prevent appropriate immune response routing, leading to enhanced bacterial colonization and increasing risk for mortality [45\u201348].\n",

For example, influenza interacts with both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The most common bacteria found in viral, secondary bacterial infections is S. pneumoniae [15]. S. pneumoniae has over 97 distinct serotypes and is a common cause of acute otitis media (AOM), pneumonia, sepsis, and bacterial meningitis [85\u201387]. One of the most common complications of influenza infection is AOM from either S. pneumonia or S. aureus [15, 88]. Since influenza is one of the common viral contributors to pneumonia, it also increases the rates of bacterial pneumonia from S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. This is because influenza with both of these bacteria has synergistic relationships using the mechanisms listed above [15, 26]. In addition, the bacteria increase influenza\u2019s infectivity by activating hemagglutinin on the membrane, thus neutralizing antibodies and allowing more virions to be replicated inside the host cell [15, 89]. Table 1 reviews the most common viral-bacterial co-infections and their associated complications.",

Similarly, H. influenza stimulates adhesion proteins on human epithelial cells, creating an entry point for rhinovirus [91]. Rhinovirus also has a bi-directional relationship with S. aureus: rhinovirus aids in the bacterial adhesion and engulfment into the epithelium cell and S. aureus promotes the replication of rhinovirus [70]. Rhinovirus can actually increase the nasal load of S. aureus by 39% over baseline [70].",

In this study, RSV and S. pneumoniae co-detection was significantly associated with severe disease in the regression analysis. In a cohort study of children admitted with acute respiratory disease, bacterial superinfections were significantly associated with higher illness severity scores (OR = 2.12), more severe respiratory distress (OR = 4.4), required more respiratory support (OR 3.4), and have longer hospital length of stay [93]. It is encouraging to note that the children who received the pneumococcal vaccine had lower illness severity, less respiratory distress, required less respiratory support, and had less admissions to the PICU [93].",
