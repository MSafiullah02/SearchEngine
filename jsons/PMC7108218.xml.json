            "text": "In the 1970s, with antibiotics and vaccines at hand and the eradication of smallpox within reach, there was a general optimism that infectious diseases would soon be a thing of the past. In 1972 the Nobel laureate Macfarlane Burnet concluded that: \u2018If \u2026 we retain a basic optimism and assume no major catastrophes occur and that any wars are kept at the \u2018brush fire\u2019 level, the most likely forecast about the future of infectious disease is that it will be very dull\u2019. The pandemic of HIV crushed this optimism, and infectious diseases were put back on the global health agenda, of which the 1992 publication Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States\n1 has been a landmark. Since then, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among many different pathogens, including against last-resort antibiotics, the continuous emergence of (mostly) viruses with potential for human-to-human or pandemic spread, and the intentional release of pathogens as terrorist weapons are continuously reminding us that infectious diseases are actually far from dull.",

Emergence can be from the spread of a new agent (including known agents with a new resistance mechanism), from recognition of an infection that has been present but undetected in the population, or from the realization that an established disease has an infectious origin. Emergence can also be used to describe the reappearance (or re-emergence) of a known infection after a decline in incidence.1\n",

Historically, there have been several profound and distinct transitions in human environmental and interpopulation interactions that have radically changed the spectrum and causes of infectious disease in human populations (Table 1\n). Today, we are living through the fourth great historical transition. The invasiveness of human activity into all geographical areas of the world, the globalization of economic activities and culture, the speed and accessibility of distant contact, the spread and intensification of urbanization, and our increasing reliance on either intricate or massive technology, are reshaping the relations between humans and microbes.4\n",

The pathogen has to overcome various biological barriers (interspecies, intrahuman, interhuman) to move from one stage to the next, to be able finally to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. Based on data from 1940 onwards, the hotspots for emergence of infectious diseases were mapped for zoonotic infections from wildlife and domestic animals, and for drug-resistant and vector-borne organisms. Figure 2\nshows that these hotspots are primarily located in South and South-East Asia, South and Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa.5\n",

However, experience shows us that we have not been able to appropriately predict, anticipate or tackle emergences of unknown pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, known pathogens such as Ebola and Zika virus, or even the annual reappearance of H7N9 influenza in China. A more proactive approach, for example using platform technologies to develop libraries of vaccines and monoclonal agents that can be mass-produced when needed, is therefore warranted.",

Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, although avian influenza viruses attract most international attention, hand, foot and mouth disease, caused by a fluid spectrum of non-polio enteroviruses, is associated with hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations of children <5 every year; this includes with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications and a mortality of around 0.1%, showing that humans can also be a source of emerging infections (Table 3\n).",

It is crucial that each patient's history should include a travel history, which involves more than asking for the countries the patient has visited.
