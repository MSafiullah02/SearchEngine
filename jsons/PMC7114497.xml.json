The commonly accepted mechanism of miRNA regulation is that the seed region (2 \u223c 8 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end) of an miRNA is complementary to the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032- or 3\u2032-UTR) of an mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation or translational inhibition (Bartel, 2009, Gottwein and Cullen, 2008). Recent work has shown the importance of miRNAs in regulating host\u2013pathogen interactions and innate immunity (Lodish et al., 2008, Scaria et al., 2007, tenOever, 2013).",

These two genotypes on two different continents share only approximately 60% nucleotide sequence identity (Forsberg, 2005, Hanada et al., 2005).

Here, we found that miR-26a is an anti-PRRSV host factor. Over-expression of miR-26a inhibited infection by both of the major PRRSV genotypes in a dose-dependent manner. We found that miR-26a does not target the PRRSV genome directly, but rather affects the expression of type I interferon and the IFN-stimulated genes MX1 and ISG15 during PRRSV infection. Our study reveals an example of a miRNA that affects viral propagation and highlights a host factor that may be important for future control measures against PRRS.",

Among the miRNAs tested, over-expression of the miR-26a mimic strongly reduced PRRSV titers (Fig. 1A). Transfection of miR-26a/26b inhibitors demonstrated the opposite effects (Fig. 1B), indicating that miR-26 has antiviral activity against PRRSV replication and that miR-26a is a more efficient suppressor than miR-26b. All the other miRNA mimics tested had no demonstrable impact on PRRSV titers in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1A).

Over-expression of the miR-26a mimic, but not the NC mimic, reduced PRRSV replication in multiple PRRSV strains of differing genotypes (Fig. 2A). To corroborate our findings with miR-26a further, MARC-145 cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of miR-26a mimic (5, 20, 40, 80 nM) and then infected with vAPRRS. Both PRRSV growth and the amount of ORF7 mRNA level were inhibited as a function of the dose of miR-26a mimic (Fig. 2B and C). Consistent with this, transfecting the miR-26a mimic also reduced the accumulation of the PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). To exclude the possibility that reduced PRRSV replication was due to potential toxicity of the miR-26a mimic, MARC-145 cells were transfected with the miR-26a mimic at different doses (40 nM, 80 nM, and 160 nM). No appreciable effect of the miR-26a mimic (at up to 160 nM) on cellular viability and morphology was observed (data not shown). Collectively, these data show that miR-26a reduces PRRSV replication in multiple PRRSV genotypes in a dose-dependent manner.",

As previously reported, miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions may require seed-matched sites at nucleotides 2\u20138 (Bartel, 2009). Thus, we mutated miR-26a mimic at non-seed nucleotides 1, 9, or 1 and 9 and miR-26 at seed nucleotides 2\u20136 (26a-m and 26b-m). Both miR-26a and miR-26b had anti-PRRSV activity in PAMs. PAMs transfected with miR-26a or miR-26b mimics yielded significantly lower PRRSV titers and ORF7 gene expression compared with cells transfected with the NC mimic (Fig. 3A and B). Three miR-26a mutants with non-seed mutations retained their ability to inhibit PRRSV progeny production and gene expression (Fig. 3A and B). By contrast, seed mutations at nts 2\u20136 abrogated the ability of miR-26 family members to repress PRRSV replication and gene expression (Fig. 3A and B), showing that the seed region was essential for inhibiting PRRSV replication.",

These results indicated that miR-26 family members, especially miR-26a, can inhibit vJX143 replication in PAMs. We then analyzed the kinetics of miR-26 expression in PRRSV infected PAM cells.

In recent studies, miR-181 and miR-23 were confirmed to reduce viral gene expression and viral growth due to direct targeting of PRRSV genomic RNA (Guo et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2014). We determined whether miR-26a specifically targets the PRRSV genome to exert its antiviral effect by constructing a range of firefly luciferase reporter pGL3-Control based plasmids, which contained the cDNA fragments representing the 5\u2032 UTR, nsp1-nsp12, ORF2-ORF7, and the 3\u2032 UTR of the PRRSV genome downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (Fig. 4A). If the PRRSV cDNA insert contains a miR-26a target sequence, luciferase reporter expression is expected to be subjected to miR-26a-regulation. MiR-26a or NC mimics were co-transfected with the individual reporter vectors into BHK-21 cells, along with an internal control vector pRL-CMV. Relative luciferase activities were quantified 24 h post-transfection. The relative luciferase activities for different vectors containing various PRRSV cDNA fragments were not significantly different between cells transfected with miR-26a mimic as compared with cells transfected with the NC mimic. Thus, miR-26a does not appear to target directly the PRRSV genome.",

Type I interferons (IFNs) are potent antiviral cytokines whose expression is triggered through recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors via a cascade of signaling molecules (Sun et al., 2012). PAMs are the main target cells for PRRSV infection, and many gene expression studies have explored the immune response of PAMs to PRRSV. Such studies have shown that the expression levels of MX1, USP, IFN-\u03b2, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 are affected by PRRSV infection (Albina et al., 1998, Luo et al., 2008, Van Reeth et al., 1999). Overall, these analyses suggest that PRRSV subverts host defenses by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Van Reeth et al., 1999) and stimulating weak production of IFN-\u03b1 (Sun et al., 2012).",

The restoration of innate immune responses to produce type I IFNs in PAMs seems to be miRNA specific, because another miRNA (miR-181b) had no such effect (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that miR-26a-induced type I IFN expression can overcome PRRSV interference, contributing to viral clearance. This mechanism provides a higher genetic barrier to the emergence of viral escape mutants, so the identification and characterization of miR-26a as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication may open new ways to control future PRRS outbreaks, for which effective control measures remain scant.",

MiR-21, miR-29a, and let-7b have dual functions; on one hand, they bind to Argonaute proteins and guide the silencing of target genes, and on the other hand, they act independently of Argonaute proteins by interacting directly with TLRs.
