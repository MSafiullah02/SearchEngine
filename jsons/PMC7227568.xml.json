Overall, any emergency preparedness cycle comprises the following key elements, namely, prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation [7,8]. Preparedness refers to a continuous process of planning, organising, training, equipping, drills (exercises), evaluating and taking corrective action. Therefore, drills are a key activity of preparedness to respond to emergencies [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. It also should be highlighted that there are two types of drills: discussion-based or desktop exercises, and operational-based exercises [10,11]. A detailed description of the features of each of these are given in Ref. [[9], [10], [11]]. Further, drills could be announced or unannounced [10,11]. It may be argued that most earthquake evacuation drills are of the announced type.",

That is, following the devastating 1985 earthquake that hit the Capital City [21], the Seismic Alert System of Mexico (SASMEX), an earthquake early warning system (hereafter either EEW or SASMEX), was implemented and it is being regarded as the first such system in the world [22,23]. Further, in 2004, the mayor of the city implemented the policy to conducting earthquake mass drills on 19 September yearly [17,24,25]. To conduct the drill, the warning is issued in a predefined date and time. Since then, there have been about twenty-two mass drills being conducted in the city. In particular, the following research question was addressed in the paper: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass earthquake drills yearly? The approach taken to the analysis has been the use of logistic regression technique.",

It has been regarded as the strongest earthquake since the one that occurred in the country in 1975 (Mw = 8.1). As expected, several states of the southern region of the country were severely affected, and hundreds of people were killed; further details can be found in Ref. [26].",

The SASMEX aim was to alert the residents of the city of earthquakes originating in the subduction zone along the Pacific coast of the country. It is believed that since 2015, the mayor of the capital city decided to disseminate the seismic alert to the general public through a network of over twelve thousand loudspeakers distributed throughout the city [23]. Further, the existing policy for issuing the alert is the following: no alert is issued for earthquakes with M\nb < 5.5 (M\nb = body-wave magnitude); relay a preventive alert if 5.5\u2264M\nb < 6.0; and issue the alert when M\nb \u2265 6.0 [23, p.1453].",

A team comprising mainly postgraduate students administered the questionnaires to a sample of 2400 participants. Overall, the approach was to go and ask personnel from different organizations to participate in the study, such as shopping malls, public libraries, restaurants, and high rising buildings. We also visited schools, universities, and research centres; further, we randomly selected households located throughout the sixteen city councils that comprise the capital city. It should be highlighted that in some instances it was necessary to contact the public relations manager for his/her authorization to administer the questionnaires (e.g., high-rise buildings, schools, public libraries). As mentioned in Refs. [26], participants completed the questionnaires anonymously and were assured of the confidentiality of their answers. Moreover, they were given the contact details of the researchers. Also, the survey was approved by the institute ethics committee. The response rate (RR) was 95%, given the fact that people were very proactive and willing to participate at the time.",

Since 2004, mass drills have been conducted on 19 September every year in the capital city of the country. The aim of the present study was to address the following research question: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass evacuation drills yearly? Logistic regression was employed to identify these factors. First, we assessed the unadjusted relationships between the outcome and each potential predictor variable singly. Then, we adjusted these relationships for potential confounding effects. Finally, we considered the possibility of interaction effects between some of the variables. Of the 19 explanatory variables considered initially in the process of building the model (Table 3), only seven variables and one interaction term were significantly related to the dependent variable; i.e.: age & occupation (Demographics), frequency of drills (Drills), knowledge vs drills (Earthquake knowledge), \u2018perception vulnerability city\u2019 (Perception of seismic risk), warning time & the usefulness of the SASMEX, and the \u2018perception vulnerability city\u2019 by occupation interaction.",

It may be argued that this proportion may not be that high as one would have expected (i.e., 46.9% responded \u201cNo\u201d). However, these findings are consistent with those reported in Refs. [[7], [8], [9], [10]] in the sense that earthquake drills are important in building a resilient community to seismic risk. For example, it is believed that more than 57 million people participated in drills across 56 countries and most of the US (this is according to the ShakeOut.org as cited in Ref. [20]). Similarly, in New Zealand, in 2012 about 1.3 million people registered to participate in \u201cShakeOut\u201d drill [20]. Further, by participating in drills, people will act if they believe that by doing this (i.e. drill participation) will increase their chance of survival and recovery; therefore, they will be more likely to undertake that action [20,40,41]. However, there is evidence that drill participation in some countries are low, for example, the 2005 evacuation drill participation in Japan was 19% [18]; similarly, the participation rate in the 2014 evacuation drill that took place in the city of Ishinomaki (Japan) was only 7.3% [18]. The low participation is attributed, among other things, to embarrassment [20], lack of motivation value of such drills [18]. It should be highlighted that we could not compare the lack of drill participation, if any, of the residents of the capital city because there is not available data. Similar studies on the effectiveness of evacuation drills should be investigated in the context of our case study.",

Also, in the report on the \u201cShakeOut\u201d survey, in relation to school drill frequency, it has been found that 56% and 54% of school and district respondents, respectively, considered the need to conduct four or more drills per year [19, p.31]. Further research is needed to explain this difference; for example, by conducting a similar analysis in relation to the two questions that have not been addressed here, i.e., those related to whether respondents agree on conducting mass evacuation drills anytime during the day and night (see the Appendix).",

However, what is less clear is, why those participants that do not have adequate knowledge, were also not interested in participating in drills. It may be argued that there are other precursors outside their personal control besides drills, e.g., the quality of the drill exercises, among others; for example, in Ref.

In general, the aim of an EEW system is to alert people by proving a few seconds/minutes to take some sort of action before the actual ground shaking [22,23,26]. The results showed that the variable warning time was significantly associated with the dependent variable. Respondents that considered the warning time varies were more likely to agree on conducting drills than those that responded \u201cOther\u201d (e.g., 50 s, 2 min, etc.). This may be explained given the fact that during the 07 September 2017 earthquake, the warning was issued in time (i.e., about 2 min before the actual shaking). However, the 19 September earthquake (the earthquake that occurred twelve days after the first one), the warning was issued almost simultaneously with the ground shaking. Because of this, respondents may have perceived the need for drills in order to enhance their response capabilities during the emergency. Again, a detailed analysis of the performance of the SAMEX during the two earthquakes is presented in Ref. [26]. The importance of knowing the warning time before the shaking is consistent with similar studies [19,20,26,[43], [44], [45], [46]].",

Given the fact that earthquakes cannot be predicted, earthquake early warning systems are essential in alerting people to take actions and prevent fatalities [22,23,26,33,47], but people should be educated on their features, warning time, etc; in other words, EEW systems should be people-centred [26].",

These results may be consistent with those reported in Ref. [20]; for example, schools represented the highest proportion of drill participation (49% in 2012 and 50% in 2015) [20, p.5]; this was followed by personnel from business (15%) government (5%), and health organizations (4%) [20, p.6]. Effectively, more research may be needed to better understand why people do not participate in drills. Finally, when considering the variable age, it has been found that respondents whose age ranged from 13-49 years old were more likely to agree on conducting drills yearly than those over 50's.",

Why not evacuation drills in other dates? Why not any time during the day? Why not at any time during the night? More generally, should earthquake evacuation drills be unannounced? These questions need to be addressed because of their implications in the way people may respond to the emergency [47]. That is, historical data shows that earthquakes have occurred anytime during the day and night and with devastating consequences. For example, the 07 September that hit Mexico City in 2017 occurred at 23.49 h local time, where most people were about to go to bed (or some were sleeping already); it may be argued that people's reaction to earthquakes at night may be different than during daylight, for example, the evacuation from high rising buildings [48]. More research should be conducted on these issues to gain a better understanding on peoples' response under these (or any other) scenarios.",

However, it sheds some light on issues that may be required to \u2018validate\u2019 with a probability sample. As mentioned in section 2.2, a two-way interaction approach has been considered in the present analysis. As it has been argued in Ref. [49,50], a potential pitfall may be that higher order interaction (e.g. a three-way) effects that do not coincide, for example, with the employed approach effects might be missed.

In particular, the following research question has been addressed: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass earthquake drills yearly? The approach has been the application of logistic regression to identify these factors. Of the 19 initial explanatory variables, in the final model, only seven variables were significantly associated with the outcome variable; i.e.: age & occupation (Demographics), frequency of drills (Drills), knowledge vs drills (Earthquake knowledge), \u2018perception vulnerability city\u2019 (Perception of seismic risk), warning time & usefulness of SASMEX (EEW), and the \u2018perception vulnerability city\u2019 by occupation interaction.",
