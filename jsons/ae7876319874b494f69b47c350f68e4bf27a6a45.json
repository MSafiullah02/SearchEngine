            "text": "(compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, CARS) [1] . Although CARS opposes to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [2] , this is a double-edged sword because the risk of septic complications is increased. If unresolved, SIRS and CARS become the underlying players of a catabolic syndrome that leads to MODS and ultimately death [3] . In the past SIRS was viewed as an exaggerated response to inflammatory stimuli, but the latest experimental and observational data indicate that it is a rather predictable side effect of especially severe morbid events. In practice, SIRS and CARS result from the growing sophistication of ICU care that keeps patients alive during the early (acute) phase of traumatic and septic diseases. The protracted survival of formerly rapid lethal conditions makes now appreciable their natural evolution. Recent acquisitions also suggest that SIRS and CARS develop simultaneously rather than in sequence as previously believed. As a result a mixed antagonist response syndrome (MARS) was coined to reflect the balance between SIRS and CARS [4] (Fig. 2.1 ). However, the phenotypic predominance of the hyperinflammatory state is the rule in early sepsis, hypoxia, or trauma as influenced by antigenic load, microbial virulence, host genetic factors, age, nutritional status, and comorbidities [5] . In the past CARS was believed to develop after SIRS exhaustion by repeated noxious stimuli (second hit theory) [5, 6] . According to this theory, recurrent morbid insults augment the inflammatory response by repeated stimulation of the inflammatory cascade. In this sense, SIRS would no longer depend by the initial insult but rather by the intensity and frequency of subsequent hits. However, the continuous challenge of the inflammatory system mounts an antiinflammatory response that ultimately becomes predominant. So CARS does not develop simultaneously with SIRS, but only a minimal overlap would exist between the two phe-nomena. This pathophysiological view is derived from the observation that CARS prevails in the later stages of disease when the increased susceptibility to infections is associated with a weakened pro-inflammatory response (SIRS exhaustion). This concept translated into the linear transition from acute (early) SIRS to chronic (late) CARS with possible alternating recurrence of the two phases (MARS), (Fig. 2.2) .",

            "text": "However, this view is no longer accepted as the historical belief of the \"cytokine storm\" after a catastrophic acute illness (e.g., meningococcal sepsis) giving the spectacular inflammatory reaction is not the rule [7] . Instead, the most common picture is by far a patient over 65 years of age with sepsis or recovering from multiple trauma/surgery and evidence of immunosuppression without the typical exaggerated acute phase inflammatory response [7] . In the past \"cytokine storm\" was synonymous of SIRS that is hyperinflammation defined by excessive release of classical proinflammatory cytokines including IL1, IL6, IL8, and TNF\u03b1. However, this concept is too narrow as it was quickly noted that \"cytokine storm\" is not the typical occurrence in late (chronic) sepsis or even in acutely septic patients with a weakened immune system [8, 9] . Similarly, it seems incorrect to define CARS on the basis of elevated release of antiinflammatory cytokines in the blood. The current concept is rather that the magnitude of cytokine release depends on the premorbid immune-inflammatory status of the patient [10] . Otherwise stated the healthier the patient, the stronger will be the release of cytokines after stimulus. As a corollary, the more protracted is the disease, the more faded will be the inflammatory response over time (e.g., recurrent sepsis in postsurgical or trauma patient). However, an acute inflammatory response although typical of the acute phase may occur at any time of the disease profile if the host is sufficiently immunologically responsive. This view holds for both the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, so it is incorrect to define the patient's inflammatory status on the basis of his/her cytokine profile [10] . Therefore, the mixed cytokine response pattern better represents the patient's inflammatory status leading to the paradigm \"Sepsis: Always in MARS\" [11] . Thus a hyperinflammatory status at the onset of sepsis or multiple trauma reflects the ability of the host to release a great amount of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Such ability is destined to fade over time with progression to a late (chronic) inflammatory status. In recent years, the immunocompetent cells have emerged as a new relevant player for the appearance of immunosuppression or immunoparalysis that often characterizes the host's response during the more chronic disease stages. At present, the process of immunosuppression (decreased T-cell proliferation and production of IL2, decreased monocyte and macrophage function) is believed to occur in parallel with the hyperinflammatory status of early sepsis of traumatic or surgical origin [12, 13] . Animal studies indicate that in non-survivors, the immune cell suppression progresses indefinitely up to anergy from the very beginning to the more chronic stages in a timeindependent manner [10] . As a result, the phenotype of immunosuppression does not often correspond to the cytokine pattern of peripheral blood.",

Conversely, the chronic state is preceded by a progressive (subacute or chronic) impairment of immune cells function with robust pre-lethal signs of anergy and a deteriorating but MARS-like cytokine profile (simultaneous presence of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators in the blood) [10] . The spread of the inflammatory process starting from a single organ or tissue is by far the most frequent event in the pathophysiology of acute diseases. The inflammatory response is a highly coordinated process, which has evolved to limit the spread of noxious stimuli, eliminates pathogens and necrotic cellular debris, and promotes the healing of damaged tissues. It is subjected to multiple activations and control mechanisms and whose efficiency is largely dependent on genetic predisposition, age, and neurovegetative and hormonal milieu derived from the stress response. Finally, inflammation and immunity are tightly related in a complex network of multiple interconnections and reverberating loops. However, extremely intense or repeated stimulations may disturb their tuned response so that the inflammatory mediators spill over the anatomical barriers and multiple organs dysfunction syndrome ensues. Cardinal inflammation phenomena are local vasodilation, increased endothelial permeability, and chemotactic cells activation from the natural (granulocytes and monocytes) and acquired immune system (lymphocytes). The vascular mechanisms that lead to the four cardinal signs of inflammation are resumed in Fig. 2. 3.",

MARS is a transitional state in-between them capillary vasodilation, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis are defensive mechanisms that act in concert to ensure the maximum of protection against any threat or danger. A multiplicity of cell types (e.g., endothelium, monocytes, platelets) as well as humoral factors (complement, leukotrienes, kinins) acts following a synergistic and often redundant logic to activate, propagate, and maintain the inflammation so that the host defense is guaranteed. Nevertheless, the uncontrolled diffusion of inflammatory mediators causes hypotension and tissue edema by generalized vasodilation and increased endothelial permeability. Furthermore, the diffuse deposition of microthrombi by disseminated intravascular coagulation worsens the oxygen supply to tissues this, in turn, contributing to ischemic cells damage, further inflammation (ischemia/reperfusion injury), and MODS. The local action of the inflammatory system is similar to a well-refined military strategy. After an enemy attack (e.g., trauma) that engages the local garrison (resident macrophages and glial cells), the combat zone is rapidly enclosed and sealed by reinforcement troops (chemotactic activation of PMNs and intravascular coagulation). Thereafter, the soldiers get into the battlefield (increased membrane permeability and leukocytes migration) and shoot at the enemy destroying him (phagocytosis, proteases, and toxic oxygen products). However, after a massive attack, the hurried and often disorganized mobilization of the reserve troops makes difficult or even impossible to implement an effective defense. The recruitment of soldiers is often chaotic and uncoordinated (widespread chemotactic activation), the effective concentration of troops is impossible (generalized increase of endothelial permeability), and military patrols often shoot at innocent people (organ damage). Thus, pneumococcal pneumonia can transform into severe sepsis or septic shock if a generalized inflammatory reaction develops by either cellular (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, endothelium) or humoral effectors (complement, contact phase proteins, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines) resulting into increased capillary permeability (tissue edema), vasodilation (hypotension), and coagulation activation (ischemic organ damage). Generally, the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction are infections, trauma, and ischemiareperfusion damage. Each of them can act by itself or in combination with the other two. For example, multiple trauma causes the activation of immune-inflammatory mechanisms by itself (tissue necrosis), or as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion damage (e.g., gut ischemia by post- traumatic mesenteric hematoma or post-ischemic muscular tissue reperfusion after hemorrhagic shock). Apart from the abovementioned mechanisms, the uncontrolled activation of the immune system (autoimmune diseases), massive cytokines production (metastatic cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma), and the unrestrained activation of serum proteases (acute pancreatitis) are less frequent causes of generalized inflammatory activation.",

PAMPs and DAMPs are grouped into the larger family of \"alarmins\" in assignment to the term danger signals [15] . Otherwise stated PAMPs and DAMPs constitute a physiologic signaling system that alerts the body to the presence of foreign invaders or noxious stimuli. \"Alarmins\" activate specific receptors of the superfamily of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [18, 19] , expressed on endothelial and innate immune cells like macrophages, dendritic cells (antigenpresenting cells, APCs), monocytes, and PMNs [20] . APCs act as an intermediate between innate and acquired immune system. Their main function is to process antigen material and to present it to effector T cells of the immune system. TLR receptors recognize a variety of peptides that are important signaling molecules for activation and production of a multiplicity of inflammatory mediators. In addition, DAMPs are potent activators of the complement system [21] [22] [23] whose anaphylatoxins attract monocytes and PMNs on the endothelium. The high mobility group box protein (HMGB) is one of the most studied \"alarmin.\" HMBG is a protein molecule derived from the nucleus of damaged cells [15, 24] .

These inflammatory mediators also activate PMNs to express adhesion surface molecules for appropriate ligands on the activated endothelium [37] . This receptor-ligand interaction allows for adhesion of leukocytes to the capillary wall. Thereafter PMNs migrate through the endothelial barrier into the tissues by opportune signaling receptors on the inner surface of the endothelium. In the meanwhile, resident macrophages secrete cytokines (TNF\u03b1 and IL-1) and chemokines (IL-8) which help the immune and inflammatory cells in selfregulating and crosstalking each other. ",

Among the most relevant properties of cytokines, there is the ability to activate monocytes (innate immune system) and lymphocytes (acquired immune system) [39] . Under the appropriate cytokine pattern, the circulating monocytes differentiate into resident macrophages, while lymphocytes mature into different cell lines having immune-stimulatory (Th-1), immune-depressant (Th-2), and immune-modulatory (Treg) action [40] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger both the recruitment and the phagocytic activity of leukocytes [41] .

Its actions include the stimulation of many cell types and survival or apoptosis [42] , cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-8, IF\u03d2, IL-10), activation of the arachidonic acid pathways (thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin E2) and nitric oxide, induction of fever and production of selectins, and PAF (see below). TNF secretion is stimulated by many physiological stresses (hemorrhage, hypoxemia) as well as ischemia-reperfusion, endotoxin, and complement system. Macrophages and monocytes are the main TNF producers, although activated T cells are also implicated. Tumor necrosis factor acts via its receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 with effects that depend on the specific receptor binding and environmental factors influence. Binding of TNF-\u03b1 to TNFR1 leads to transcription of pro-inflammatory genes via the NF-Kb transcription factor. However, TNFR1 possesses a death domain at the cytoplasmic tail so that its stimulation also induces apoptosis via the caspase enzymes cascade (see below). Although these two effects seem contradictory, they might represent an adaptive mechanism that has evolved to protect cells against excessive stimulation (see below: Kidney Dysfunction). In contrast to the almost ubiquitous TNF1R, TNFR2 is expressed on immune and endothelial cells only and becomes activated by membrane-bound TNF-\u03b1 [42, 43] . Binding to TNFR2 leads to activation and proliferation of neutrophils and many immune cells as NK cells, B cells, and peripheral T cells [44] .",

It also induces the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow and stimulates the expression of proteases and metalloproteases by tissues. IL-1\u03b2 is secreted by macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. Stimuli for IL-1\u03b2 include TNF, complement, endotoxin, hemorrhage, and ischemia. The effects of IL-1\u03b2 are mediated by the type IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) which belongs to the IL-1 receptor superfamily. Besides IL-1\u03b2, another molecule that binds IL-1RI is the so-called soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA) suggesting a controlling role in IL-1-mediated immune response. 3. The third important cytokine in the early inflammatory response is IL-6. Its secretion is induced by TNF and IL-1 [46] . Although it does not induce SIRS when injected into experimental animals, IL-6 has vasodilatory properties as it induces the production of nitric oxide by the endothelial cells. IL-6 is a subacute cytokine with marked regulatory properties on immune cell growth and differentiation. It inhibits apoptosis of neutrophils and stimulates the hepatic acute phase protein synthesis but also exhibits an anti-inflammatory action [47] by inducing the release of soluble TNFR and IL-1RA [48] . It seems, therefore, to play a dual role in the inflammatory response by acting both as a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediator [49, 50] . Clinical studies demonstrated increased plasma levels in non-survivor septic patients so that IL-6 has been proposed as a prognostic marker [51] [52] [53] . 4. The chemokine IL-8 is the most powerful chemoattractant for PMNs and monocytes [54] . Chemokines control the traffic of the immune cells, which are the main effectors of the immune system. Their binding to G-protein-coupled receptors leads to dose-dependent effects including chemotaxis and activation of immune cells. After stimulation by IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, complement, microbial products (e.g., LPS), hypoxia, and reperfusion, IL-8 increases neutrophils degranulation, adherence, and chemotaxis. Interestingly, chemokines act as chemoattractants in lower doses and potent activators of immune cells function in higher doses. Recently a group of so-called silent chemokine receptors has been described suggesting a role as decoy or scavenger receptors. The Duffy antigen receptors for chemokines (DARC), first described as blood group antigen, have been shown to bind IL-8 and other chemokines thus suggesting a regulatory action against excessive leukocyte activation in the systemic circulation [39] .",

They are responsible for the activation of PMNs and endothelium and platelet aggregation. These substances are generated by activation of the phospholipases A2 and C (PLA 2 and PLC) which follows the entry of Ca 2+ ions into damaged cells. PLA 2 also induces the release of PAF from the endothelium. PAF is an important inflammatory mediator with marked effects on macrophages, endothelial cells, and platelets aggregation.

            "text": "1. The complement cascade is a series of enzymatic cleavage reactions that are activated via the classical route by antigen-antibody complexes (IgM and IgG) or alternatively by bacterial degradation products (e.g., LPS, endotoxin) [32, 55, 56] . The latter pathway does not require prior immunization and thus represents an immediate defense mechanism against microbes. Conversely, the \"natural antibodies\" activate the complement by forming antigen-antibody complexes with different molecular species from exogenous (microbial) or endogenous (necrotic cells) origin [57] [58] [59] . \"Natural antibodies\" are physiologically circulating antibodies that arise in serum independently from prior host immunization [60] . They are mainly produced by a subpopulation of CD5 + B cells and are poly-reactive with different antigens as peptides, phospholipids, and polysaccharides [60] [61] [62] . In musculoskeletal trauma and ischemia-reperfusion injury, the intense antigenic stimulation leads to binding of natural IgM antibodies and development of post-traumatic \"innate autoimmunity\" [63] . Complement activation leads to the formation of opsonins, anaphylatoxins, and the membrane attack complex, a multiprotein complex responsible for the increased capillary permeability [32] . Anaphylatoxins and opsonins are involved in important inflammatory processes such as opsonization, chemotaxis, and neutrophils degranulation. Complement also promotes the synthesis of acute phase proteins by the liver and stimulates the degranulation of mast cells with histamine release (vasodilation) [32, 64] . In practice, the activated complement is involved in all the most relevant inflammatory processes as immune cells attraction to the site of trauma or infection, microbial phagocytosis and lysis, antigens opsonization, platelets activation, and histamine release. The complement cascade is, therefore, a fundamental component of the innate host defense as it can be rapidly activated in a non-specific manner after injury or infection. It is phylogenetically ancient due to its basic role in the host response to bacterial pathogens. However, the systemic activation of the complement leads to severely deleterious effects such as shock and tissue edema due to massive vasodilation and increased membrane permeability. 2. Coagulation factor XII and kallikrein, together with kininogen, represent the contact phase system. These proteins activate each other by forming an integrated, highly amplified system for activation of the coagulation cascade. Kallikrein also stimulates the formation of the vasodilator bradykinin from kininogen. Kinins are potent vasodilators and vigorous effectors of increased vascular permeability [65] . A close interconnection exists between hemostasis and the inflammatory system. For example, the activated platelets aggregate with circulating leuko- cytes to stimulate the immune cells system with production of endothelial damage [66] . Platelets also release pro-inflammatory mediators that excite the immune system [67] thus creating a vicious circle that produces more and more SIRS. The activated coagulation cascade after trauma or infection is primarily intended to stop the loss of blood and to seal the lesion. Thereafter, phagocytic and immune cells eliminate necrotic cells and invading microbes. However, the uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade causes the widespread deposition of microthrombi, this in turn causing hypoxic cellular damage and increased risk for hemorrhagic complications due to consumption of platelets and coagulation factors [68] [69] [70] [71] . Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathophysiological mechanism that frequently occurs after multiple trauma [68, 70, 71] and severe infections [68, 70] . DIC is responsible for diffuse microthrombi deposition, capillary blockade with heterogeneous microcirculatory perfusion, tissue ischemia, and production of hypoxic cellular damage [68, 72] . 3. Acute phase proteins are synthesized in the liver by induction of the locally (Kupffer cells) produced cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, and IL6). This process is amplified by circulating cytokines that spillover from injured or infected tissue (overflow theory). Acute phase proteins include C-reactive protein (CRP), \u03b1-1-antitrypsin, \u03b1-2macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB), fibrinogen, and prothrombin [73] . These proteins have several inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. For example, CRP increases the surface expression of tissue factor (TF) [74] , a procoagulant membranebound 4.5 kD protein on PMNs, monocytes, and tissue macrophages (see below). Conversely, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin neutralizes leukocyte proteases and free oxygen radicals, while \u03b1-2-macroglobulin and ceruloplasmin are inhibitory cofactors for the synthesis of cytokines [74] . Finally, high concentrations of LPB suppress LPS activity [75] .",

Both neutrophils and macrophages kill bacteria. The first step involves phagocytosis of opsonized microbes. Opsonization means that bacteria are covered with host proteins (e.g., antibodies and complement fragments) and appropriately recognized by cell surface receptors such as TLR and receptors for the Fc portion of the immunoglobulins. The phagocytosed bacteria are typically inserted into a vacuole, the phagosome, which fuses with primary (azurophilic) or secondary granules to form phagolysosomes. Azurophilic granules contain antimicrobial proteases such as elastase and bactericidal/permeability increasing proteins, while secondary granules contain antiseptic peptides as lysozyme, lactoferrin, and metalloproteases. Fusion of granules with phagosomes creates a hostile environment that kills the pathogen ( Fig. 2.6 ). At the same time, the resident macrophages and circulating monocytes begin to phagocyte cellular and microbial Opsonized bacteria bind to complement receptors (CRs) and FC receptors (FCRs) on the surface of phagocytic cells. Thereafter the bacterium is taken into the cytoplasm and included into a phagosome. The fusion of phagosome with specific and azurophilic granules gives a phagolysosome that destroys the bacterium by toxic and enzymatic digestion debris. These cells produce cytokines and express membrane surface antigens that originate from the digestion process (see Fig. 2 ",

The main actions of anti-inflammatory cytokines are shown in Table 2 .2. Besides these anti-inflammatory cytokines, several immune effector cells develop their actions immediately after the onset of the acute inflammatory response. The nature of their response is largely determined by the expressed membrane antigenic pattern as it determines their subsequent cellular interactions and biochemical reactions. From the native, multipotent CD4 + T helper 0 cell (Th0), two main cell lines differentiate depending on cytokine environment, either into Th1 helper cell by IL-12 or Th2 helper cell by IL-4 [78] . Thereafter IL-12 is produced, and opportune co-stimulatory molecules (CD80/86) are expressed together with MHCII antigens that bind to corresponding T-cell ligands. This binding results into T-cell activation and proliferation. The production of interferon \u03b3 stimulates the macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria [79] .

In the early stage of sepsis and trauma, a phenotypic Th1-type cells profile predominates with IF\u03d2 production which activates the bactericidal action of macrophages and induces B cell production of opsonizing and complement-fixing antibodies. Conversely, later (chronic) stages are characterized by a shift from the Th1-type profile into a predominantly Th2-type response leading to immunoparalysis, reduced antigen recognition and cellular anergy (see below) [87] . Other more complex anti-inflammatory actions include the decreased production of monocytederived cytokines by reduced transcriptional factors (NF-kB) for the encoding genes [88] . Also, the reduced expression of membrane surface receptor CD14 on monocytes (LPS-receptor) blunts their pro-inflammatory activity. Also the expression of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecules HLA-DR (human leukocyte antigen) is downregulated [89] with interference in the elimination of infected cells and maturation of several immune cell lines. These anti-inflammatory effects play an important compensatory role in the development of the counter antiinflammatory response syndrome (CARS). Ideally CARS is the physiological response to the risks of tissue damage by uncontrolled inflammation. The main SIRS and CARS events are summarized in Fig. 2 .8. The highly integrated, redundant, and coordinated immune-inflammatory system makes easy its comparison with a great classical orchestra. As a classical orchestra, there are players (neutrophils), soloists (monocytes and macrophages), and the musical score (humoral mediators). This score may be harmoniously classical (locally coordinated inflammatory response) or dissonantly dodecaphonic (SIRS). But who is the conductor?",

Moreover, its activation by inflammatory stimulus leads to platelet and leukocyte adhesion and inhibition of vasodilation. Endothelial injury can be documented microscopically by a visible change of cell shape or damage and defects of endothelial lining. Indirect evidence of the damaged endothelium is the finding of elevated soluble markers of cell injury notably thrombomodulin, intercellular adhesion molecule, and E-selectin and von Willebrand factor [91, 92] . After endothelial damage, inflammatory fluids and cells can shift from the blood into the interstitial space. Endothelial injury is sustained over time so that its property loss is long-standing [93, 94] . Experimental animal and human studies demonstrated that after injury, the full recovery of endothelial lining occurs within 21 days [93] . The denudation of the vessel wall exposes tissue factor (TF), the principal activator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway with the risk of intravascular coagulation [93, 94] . Normally the outer endothelium expresses various membrane-bound molecules with anticoagulants properties among which are cell surface heparin- . Antithrombin III (ATIII) further inhibits Thrombin activity by preventing its binding with receptor (TRr). Also tissue factor (TF) is not expressed on the endothelium, while its main physiological inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), is normally released by the intact endothelium. Finally the tis-sue plasminogen activator (tPA) catalyzes the zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, while tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (tPAI-1) is reduced. After hypoxia, injury, or sepsis, the damaged endothelium expresses large amounts of TF, while TFPI release is inhibited. Also thrombomodulin receptor is internalized thus reducing APC formation, while decreased ATIII synthesis and degradation by serine protease increases the activity of thrombin. Finally tPAI-1 synthesis and release are increased thus reducing the formation of plasmin like molecules [95] and thrombin-binding protein thrombomodulin (TM). Heparin-like molecules are supported by glycosaminoglycans which cover the endothelial surface [90] . They act as cofactors for the antithrombinmediated inhibition of thrombin and activate factor X (Stuart-Power factor) [95] . TM is the major responsible for thrombin inactivation as when bound to thrombin, forms a potent protein C (PC) activator complex that equips the endothelium with anticoagulant properties. However, the inflammatory or septic stimuli decrease the anticoagulant properties of the endothelial cells by loss or internalization of TM [96] , while the contemporaneous stimulation of the thrombin receptor increases the inflammatory pathways. Finally, the action of neutrophil proteases also contributes to reduced TM expression. Moreover, the release of tissue plasminogen activator (TPa) is decreased, while its main physiological inhibitor, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), increases so that the profibrinolytic properties of the endothelium are diminished. TF is increasingly expressed on both monocyte and macrophage membranes as well as on other cell types, while the function of its main physiological inhibitor, the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), is decreased by reduced synthesis of glycosaminoglycans on endothelial surface [97] .",

Thus, TF is inhibited by TFPI [98] , the coagulation system is counteracted by the activated protein C system [99] , and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is coupled with tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (TPAi) [100] . The imbalance between these systems results in a net procoagulant state with increased fibrin deposition, microvascular thrombotic occlusion, and risk for tissue ischemia [101] . Direct endothelial damage as occurs after trauma or ischemia-reperfusion injury contributes to activation of coagulation by decreased production of endothelial-derived substances as PGI and NO. The anti-adhesive properties of such molecules reduce leukocytes and platelets aggregation and counteract the procoagulant effectors. Localized coagulation has protective effects in discrete traumatic injuries, but its widespread activation is deleterious to the host with risk for multiple organ dysfunction and death [102, 103] .",

Complementary molecules are also expressed on the outer membrane of neutrophil and monocyte cells [104] . The surface expression, modulation, and activity of these molecules are highly regulated by locally produced cytokines (endothelial and monocyte cells) as the chemokine IL8 or PAF, IL1-\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1. The first step of the adhesion process consists of a \"rolling\" of leukocytes on the endothelial surface. This process involves selectins which are molecules expressed on leukocytes (L-selectin), endothelial cells (E-selectin), and platelets (P-selectin). Selectins act as receptors that permit a loose binding with the endothelial surface thus allowing for leukocyte rolling in proximity of opportune signaling molecules expressed on the endothelium. The second step involves the linkage of integrins with receptors of the immunoglobulins superfamily expressed on the endothelium surface. Integrins are a group of three heterodimer proteins expressed on the outer surface of activated leukocytes and collectively termed the CD11/CD18 complex. Adhesion molecules include ICAMs, E-selectins, PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules), and VECAM (vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules). The final step consists of migration of activated leukocytes to the borders of endothelial cells and interaction with the endothelial-expressed adhesion molecules ICAM, PECAM, E-selectin, and VECAM [105] . Adhesion can occur without intervention of adhesion molecules in the lung and liver. It has been suggested that actincontaining stress fibers increase at the leukocyte periphery, this, in turn, causing decreased PMNs deformability and sequestration into the pulmonary and hepatic capillary beds [106] . The main effects of endothelial cells activation are summarized in Fig. 2. 10.",

Monocytes are the circulating form of resident macrophages and dendritic cells. Resident macrophages can be found in the liver (Kupffer cells), lung (alveolar macrophages), lymphoid tissue (spleen and lymph nodes), and kidney (intra-glomerular mesangial macrophages). All these cells are very active in the synthesis of cytokines and removal of particulate antigens. In addition, they play a central role in antigen presentation to the innate Th1-type cells. APCs are fundamental for the eradication of pathogens, foreign antigens, or autologous cellular debris. Their key functions include the recognition, uptake, and killing of invading organisms. Tissue macrophages are initially activated after tissue injury by ischemic necrosis of mesenchymal cells in an IL1-\u03b1-dependent process. After the necrotic insult IL1-\u03b1 is released from the dying cells with subsequent binding to the IL-1 macrophage surface receptors. IL1-\u03b1 activates the assembly of inflammasome within the macrophage cytosol. Inflammasomes are multiprotein cytoplasmic complex that cooperate with the Toll-like receptors to respond to various insults by processing cytokines and promoting the inflammatory response. In the presence of pathogenic stimuli (e.g., alarmins), the inflammasome opens up so triggering the conversion of immature pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1-\u03b2) into mature forms and activating proapoptotic enzymes (e.g., caspases). Thereafter, the extracellular IL1-\u03b2 secretion and upregulation of IL1-\u03b2-induced chemokines, together with the increased expression of adhesion molecules, and cytokines secretion on the nearby endothelium [120, 121] allow for recruitment of circulating neutrophils and monocyte. NO synthesis is activated with resulting vasodilation, opening of endothelial gaps, and loosening of endothelial barrier properties [122] (Fig. 2.8 ).",

After the expression of chemoattractant molecules (IL8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 MCP-1, or macrophage inhibitory protein-1 MIP-1), the endothelium attracts monocytes to the inflammatory focus where they migrate into the tissue and become macrophages. Finally, the activated monocytes express large amounts of TF to propagate the procoagulant activity. After major uncomplicated trauma, the ability of APCs to express MHCII surface antigens is reduced [122] and returns to normal within a week [123] . After severe injuries, the APCs show a continuously decreased function. This deactivation leads to reduced expression of MHCII surface antigens and decreased ability to secrete cytokines which result into the increased susceptibility to infections [124] .",

            "text": "Many research findings have focused on the existence of premature programmed cell death (apoptosis) after injury, ischemia-reperfusion, and sepsis [125, 126] . Although apoptosis is an adaptive mechanism in several tissue and organs, namely, the lymphoid tissue and gut, its role seems deleterious in acute inflammatory states. Several studies suggest that the programmed cell death contributes to the derangement of cellular homeostasis in parenchymal (lung endothelial cells, kidney tubular cells, and skeletal muscle cells) and lymphoid organs with increased risk for sepsis and development of multiple organ dysfunction [87] . Accelerated apoptosis induces lymphocytopenia [127] and decreased monocyte survival as reflected by loss of monocyte CD14 expression (co-receptor for the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide-LPS) [82] . Autoactivation of cytosolic and mitochondrial caspases are the two major pathways involved in apoptosis [128] (Fig. 2.13) . Briefly, the extrinsic pathways activate caspases via binding to members of the TNF-receptor superfamily, while the mitochondrial induced pathway requires the emission of cytochrome c, otherwise essential for mitochondrial survival, into the cytosol with subsequent caspases activation [129] . Caspases are a family of proteolytic enzymes synthesized as inactive zymogens and activated by appropriate stimuli to express a death effector domain [130] . Apoptosis is a series of coordinated processes [131] that lead to DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and blebs formation in the plasma membranes. Most important this controlled form of cellular degradation carries out with minimal effects on surrounding tissues. Therefore, apoptosis in a crucial physiological process during fetal development and throughout life as it maintains the normal development and regulation of cellular proliferation. For example, during organ development apoptosis eliminates those cells that are no longer necessary. It has been estimated that without apoptosis, about 2 tons of bone marrow and lymphoid tissue would accumulate in the body [132] ! Conversely accelerated apoptosis of lymphocytes is as detrimental as delayed apoptosis in neutrophils. Neutrophil cells are constitutively apoptotic as this ensures a tight con- R e c e p to r",

Postmortem studies have confirmed immune cells apoptosis in all age groups [134, 135] . It can be speculated that apoptosis of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) [136] may be involved in bacterial translocation (see below). Several findings support the current view of immunoparalysis as a dominant feature of patients surviving the early hyperinflammatory phase. Although focal regions of inflammation ischemia and necrosis undoubtedly occur and contribute to the development of multiple organ dysfunction, death is the consequence of failure to control the primary infection or the development of new hospital-acquired infections often with opportunistic pathogens. This does not necessarily mean that infection is the main responsible for the patient's death and in fact many postmortem results are inconclusive. However, the severe decrease of innate immune function and the widespread hibernation of nonimmune cell type (cellular hibernation response) [137, 138] make apoptosis a primary mechanism for multiple organ dysfunction and ultimately death. Interestingly cancer and sepsis show similar immune defects [139] , and increased survival after improving host immunity in cancer patients is encouraging to the field of sepsis. The most frequent manifestations of immunoparalysis include profound and persistent lymphopenia, loss of delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction [140] , reactivation of latent viruses infections (herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) [141, 142] , and infection by low-virulent pathogens (e.g., Stenotrophomonas spp., Candida spp., Acinetobacter spp.) [143, 144] . Decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production including IF\u03d2, TNF, and IL-2, increased IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory cytokines, decreased monocyte/macrophage and dendritic cells function with increased expression of apoptotic surface markers, and decreased cell survival are the hallmarks of immunoparalysis. Dendritic cells and monocytes play a pivotal role in the development of decreased immune function. Their reduced survival (apoptosis susceptibility) and function abnormalities (reduced HLA-DR expression and increased production of IL-10) induces T helper cell anergy and Treg cell proliferation. The reduced capacity of monocytes to release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12), whereas the release of anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-10, IL-1RA) is not impaired or even enhanced [145] suggest for cellular reprogramming toward the anti-inflammatory pathway [146] . Monocyte dysfunction is known as endotoxin tolerance that is reduced cellular response to an endotoxin challenge. The main consequence of endotoxin tolerance is the increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections and death. Decreased immune T-cell function and T-cell exhaustion are the other leading causes of immunoparalysis.",

Phenotypic features of exhausted T cells are a decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IF\u03d2 and TNF, decreased cellular proliferation and cytotoxic function by excessive expression of PD-1 inducible co-stimulatory molecule and programmed cell death ligand PDL-1, and decreased expression of the IL-7 receptor [148] . IL-7 is a multipotential cytokine that acts to reverse immunosuppression by multiple mechanisms. It has shown to induce the two-to threefold increase of both na\u00efve (Th0-type) and CD4/CD8 cells in cancer [149] and HIV patients [150] so reversing their major pathological abnormality, i.e., profound lymphopenia. Other effects include blockade of apoptosis [151] , reversal of T-cell exhaustion [152] , increased IF\u03d2 [152] production leading to macrophage activation, and increased adhesion molecules expression on activated T lymphocytes [153] . The decrease of Th1-type, Th2-type [86, [154] [155] [156] , and Th17-type cells [86, 157] with maintenance of the number of Treg cells leads to the relative increase of regulatory functions and downregulation of effector T-cell response [86, 157] . The reduction of Th17-type cells contributes to the increased susceptibility to fungal infection due to their important role in protecting against extracellular bacterial and fungal invasion [158] . The relative increase of Treg cells is deleterious as being is associated with decreased effector T-cell proliferation and function. Their increased resistance to apoptosis with respect to the other T-cell type is probably responsible for their increased proportion [159, 160] . Treg cells can also suppress innate immune cells thus inhibiting myeloid-derived cell function [161] . Therefore, increased Treg cells impair the immune function by acting both on innate and adaptive immunity. Neutrophils, NK cells, and \u03d2\u03b4 T cells are other effectors whose function is decreased or impaired during immunoparalysis. 2. Briefly circulating neutrophils are markedly increased during the hyperinflammatory phase due to delayed apoptosis and release of immature cellular forms [162, 163] . Loss of chemotactic activity is their most frequently encountered dysfunction [164, 165] . A subset of neutrophils with suppressive properties similar to the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contributes to the development of immunoparalysis by production of large amounts of IL-10 [166] and interference in proliferation and function of effector T cells [167] . MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of myeloid cells that expand during chronic inflammatory states and cancer as a result of altered hematopoiesis. MDSCs possess strong immunosuppressive properties of both humoral and cellular type [168] . 3. NK cells are markedly reduced both in peripheral blood and tissues where they are most abundant [169] . Impaired IF\u03d2 by NK cells increases the host susceptibility to viral infections and reactivation of latent viruses, notably herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus [141, 142] . 4. \u03d2\u03b4 T cells are a subset of lymphocytes that possess functions common to the innate and adaptive immune systems. They are particularly abundant in the intestinal mucosa with innate-like defense mechanism (IF\u03d2 and IL-17 cytokines production). Intestinal \u03d2\u03b4 T cells are a first-line defense against infections [170] , and their decreased number exposes to the risk of microbial invasion of the blood and peritoneal cavity.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction Although the above mechanisms can interact in a variety of ways and combinations, immune system dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to play a prevalent role. As detailed above, the immune system dysregulation is the imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. CARS is a coordinated anti-inflammatory response to severe inflammatory stimuli that allows for the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. The \"purpose\" of CARS is to limit the noxious effects of SIRS while not interfering with pathogen elimination or healing of the injured tissue. However, CARS may be dangerous when its effects lead to a condition known as \"immunoparalysis\" with an increased risk of nosocomial sepsis and septic shock. Mitochondrial dysfunction with its hypoxic cellular implications is also important in the pathogenesis of MODS. PMNs production of reactive oxygen species (superoxide and peroxynitrite) and inflammatory cytokines induces oxidative stress that leads to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The derangement in cellular energy metabolism is known as cytophathic hypoxia, a functional concept that points out the imbalance between adequate oxygen delivery and poor oxygen utilization at the mitochondrial level. When cytophathic hypoxia develops, the result is cellular dysfunction and death. Although \"bad\" from a clinical point of view, cytophathic hypoxia may be a cellular adaptive response [171] as it can be viewed as a cellular hibernation-like state. However, if this phenomenon occurs for too long, irreversible cellular damage may result [172] .",

Although the \"sustained-hit model\" [173] predicts that the persistent stimulation of natural and acquired immune system by noxious stimuli is responsible for the maintenance of the inflammatory status, recent acquisitions implicate the apoptotic loss of \u03b4\u03d2 T cells in the intestinal mucosa [170] . There is good evidence that ischemia-reperfusion injury is the main mechanism for loss of gut barrier function [174] . As oxygenation of the villi is dependent on a counter-current mechanism such that O 2 tension at the tip of the villi is lower than that of arterial blood, any decrease in splanchnic blood flow may be associated with bacterial translocation. At this point endotoxin, bacteria, or gut ischemia can stimulate the gut-associated lymphoid tissue to generate an immune-inflammatory response that affects distant organs. Otherwise stated the gut becomes a pro-inflammatory organ, releasing cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which give origin to sepsis and MODS.",

Although many of them can be involved, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are most frequently damaged with acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis-induced hypotension being the commonest clinical presentations. It is well established that the number or dysfunctional organs affects the prognosis. Thus the probability to die with only one single dysfunctional organ is fairly less than half with respect to two or more organ dysfunction [175] . Moreover, a multicenter study established that the mortality increases almost linearly from 21.2 to 76.2% when organ dysfunction increases from 1 to \u22654 organ systems [176] . Mortality is also influenced by comorbidities notably chronic renal failure, diabetes, and cancer [176, 177] . Cumulative comorbidities also increase the risk for the development of MODS with the highest mortality rate [178] . By converse, survivors suffer from a persistent chronic illness that may last for months or even years. This illness is characterized by prolonged ICU stay, slow recovery from organs dysfunction, recurrent infections, progressive or permanent cognitive deficit, and loss of overall sense of well-being and function [179, 180] . So the duration of healthy life expectancy is reduced although the patient's overall life span is intact.",

Therefore, the preserved organ morphology is strikingly in contrast with the impairment of organ function. The loss of cellular and tissue (endothelial) barrier function seems the cornerstone for this sort of hibernation that prevents the multiplicity of organ expression, variability, and communication.

            "text": "Recent acquisitions indicate that the brain is often involved in sepsis and MODS as it is one target of SIRS either by direct activation of resident pro-inflammatory cells (neuroglia) or by mediators generated elsewhere (complement, cytokines). Although the CNS is considered an immuneprotected organ due to the blood-brain barrier, the abundance of glial cells with their signaling receptors makes the brain one of the preferred target for organ system dysfunction. Therefore, the local inflammatory reaction that follows traumatic or hypoxic (e.g., post-cardiac arrest) brain damage can spread outside the CNS thus exacerbating SIRS. Conversely, the circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators may increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier thus causing brain damage [181] . Cytokines activate monocytes to transform into glial cells (equivalent to resident macrophages in extra-cerebral tissues) so that inflammation continues in the nervous tissue [182] . Circulating cytokines also can stimulate the afferent fibers of the vagus nerve that activate the central nervous system. After stimulation of vagus nerve endings, cerebral endothelial cells are activated resulting in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier [183, 184] . The activation of cerebral endothelium also induces microvascular dysfunction, loss of cerebral vascular tone (autoregulation), and coagulopathy (microthrombi deposition) [185] . Receptors for the commonest cytokines have been found in the hippocampus, one of the most involved regions for mnemonic elaboration and neuroplasticity [181] . Chronic inflammation of the hippocampus can lead to irreversible cognitive decline, especially in the elderly. Histopathologic lesions of the brain in sepsis include cerebral edema, infarct and ischemic lesions, and microabscesses [185] . Sepsisassociated encephalopathy has been reported in 23% of people in the ICU [186] . However, the true incidence is difficult to estimate because of lack of clear definition and subjective nature of its assessment. Moreover, sedative drugs may blunt the symptoms thus making the diagnosis difficult. Symptoms include changes in consciousness, awareness, cognition, and behavior. Symptoms seem correlated with the global severity of illness as assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II score).",

Indirect damage as occurs with sepsis, pancreatitis, extrapulmonary trauma and burns, blood transfusions, and fat embolism [188, 189] Respiratory dysfunction span from extremely severe forms requiring immediate tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and paralysis to milder forms with mild hypoxia and tachypnea. The lung is the most frequent organ involved in sepsis and trauma probably because it is the single organ with the largest vascular bed and it harbors one of the largest populations of resident macrophages. ARDS is characterized by neutrophil infiltration, alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, pulmonary vascular leakage, and edema. In most severe forms the alveoli contain eosinophilic protein-rich exudate with presence of hyaline membrane [190] . Electron microscopic examination reveals extensive damage to type I alveolar pneumocytes with cellular swelling and blebbing of the plasma membranes [190] . Pulmonary edema and absorption atelectasis decrease the pulmonary volume with the occurrence of refractory hypoxia by increased pulmonary shunt. Moreover, the widespread deposition of microthrombi and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction impose a pressure overload upon the right ventricle with myocardial dysfunction and failure. The initial clinical presentation is often subtle with tachypnea, dyspnea, dry cough, and agitation. Hypoxia with hypocapnia is the most prominent laboratory feature. The magnitude of hypoxia is often unexplained by the mild or absent roentgenographic signs. CT scan reveals diffuse but nonuniform ground-glass consolidations often with a non-conformal gravitational distribution [191] . In more severe forms, multiple patchy areas of lung consolidation coalesce in massive airspace consolidation [191] . Characteristically the distribution is uniform and affects all lung zones extending to the extreme periphery of the lung fields. Hypoxia and interstitial/alveolar edema stimulate the carotid body chemoreceptors and intraparenchymal lung mechanoreceptors to hyperventilate with decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension. In the latest phases, normocapnia ensues mainly as result of increased respiratory work due to alveolar collapse, decreased pulmonary volume, and respiratory compliance. The mechanical disadvantage of decreased pulmonary compliance causes the abnormal increase of trans-pulmonary pressure (the pressure across the alveoli) that is the driving force for pulmonary expansion. The shear stress upon the delicate alveolar and interstitial structure causes further inflammation as a vicious cycle ensue with endothelial activation and worsening of pulmonary function that influences each other. Mortality from ARDS ranges from 15 to 80% [189, 192] with average values of about 30% according to most recent ventilatory strategies [193] .",

Some studies report an incidence of up to 66% [194, 195] with a mortality rate as high as 70% [195, 196] . The cardiovascular dysfunction has long been recognized as a consequence of the generalized inflammatory reaction [197] . Its most prominent clinical features are (1) myocardial dysfunction with biventricular dilation and reduced ejection fraction [198] and (2) arterial hypotension despite fluid volume infusion and decreased response to vasoactive drugs. It generally accepted that the decreased cardiac function is the product of circulating myocardial depressant factors (endotoxin, IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL6, PAF, and others) and mitochondrial damage [199] [200] [201] . Some experimental evidence indicates that endotoxin acts by inducing an inflammatory response through heart tissue macrophage, mast cells, and infiltrating blood leukocytes. The clinical picture includes the following: arterial hypotension, mental impairment, warm and dry skin, oliguria, elevated arterial blood lactates, and higher than normal mixed or central venous saturation. The hemodynamic pattern shows a high cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance [202, 203] . The picture of low cardiac output state (pale and wet skin, oliguria, and hypotension) is rarely seen and indicates a more severe form of cardiac depression [202, 203] . When examined in detail, the cardiac function appears depressed as, despite the high output state, the ejected volume is lower than normal (reduced stroke volume), the ventricle is dilated (increased diastolic volume), and its contractile state is impaired with reduced ejection fraction (increased end-systolic volume). These changes are often masked by the decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The reduced afterload allows for the maintenance of a high output state as the dysfunctional ventricle pump blood against a dilated arterial system. When the ventricular dysfunction is severe, the clinical picture resembles that of cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output, high arterial lactates, and intense peripheral vasoconstriction. Several studies have shown that cardiac dysfunction is biventricular in origin and that is potentially reversible by 7-10 days [204] . The other essential feature of cardiovascular dysfunction is arterial hypotension by decreased peripheral arterial resistance. Because a major fraction of peripheral vascular resistance is located in peripheral arteries, this segment is designated as the resistance vessels. Resistance vessels control the blood flow to organs, and it is under the control of either intrinsic (e.g., metabolic) or extrinsic (e.g., neural and humoral) factors. Intrinsic regulation plays a fundamental role in pressure-flow autoregulation (ability of an organ to keep constant the blood flow despite fluctuations in arterial pressure), reactive hyperemia (ability to increase the blood flow after relief of a vascular obstruction), and functional hyperemia (ability to cope the organ blood flow in accordance with local metabolic needs) [205, 206] . In sepsis, intrinsic regulation is compromised in all the vascular beds with the exception of the cerebral vasculature [207, 208] . This can explain the mismatch between whole oxygen supply and metabolic demands of septic shock. The increased cardiac output does not cope with the cellular energy requirements so that hypoxia and increased acid production develop.",

            "text": "By converse, the extrinsic regulation of resistance vessels is responsible for maintenance of arterial pressure and blood flow to the whole organs. During sepsis and after trauma or ischemia-reperfusion injury, a marked hypo-responsiveness to vasopressor agents is a frequent finding with development of arterial hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion. It is generally accepted that the decreased responsiveness to vasoconstrictor stimuli is consequent to increased production of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) by the induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [209] . In normal arterioles, a small amount of NO is produced by endothelial NOS (eNOS) as maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis [209] . However, cytokines and endotoxins induce iNOS to produce large quantities of NO [209, 210] . Although iNOS induction can be viewed as an adaptive response to noxious stimuli, the resulting hypotension by massive NO production is deleterious for organs and tissues. Also, there is some evidence that vascular smooth muscle can be another relevant source of NO production. In smooth muscle, neural NOS (nNOS) is upregulated thus contributing to NO generation in septic animals [211] . Another factor implicated in arteriolar hypo-responsiveness may be the complex of morphological alterations of the endothelial lining of the arterioles. Experimental studies show that the endotoxin challenge results into endothelium disruption with cell swelling, pseudopod formation, and frank denudation of the endothelial lining [212, 213] . Finally, the loss of capillary to arteriolar signaling may induce the hypo-responsiveness of arterioles to vasopressor stimuli. In normal conditions, capillaries may regulate the arteriolar tone by the upstream spread of electronic signaling along the endothelium. In sepsis, the cell-to-cell communication is impaired so that the modulation of blood flow delivery to capillaries is severely compromised [214] . Taken all together the above mechanisms may lead to the inappropriate redistribution of blood flow to tissues and organs [215, 216] . Because the arterial control of blood flow is responsible for the convective flux of oxygen to capillaries, the alteration of arterial tone may cause regional hypoxia [215] and ultimately multiple organ dysfunction. Treatment principles of hyperdynamic shock are briefly outlined in Chap. 3.",

            "text": "The most severe form of coagulation disorder is the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This pathophysio-logic mechanism results from the imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis with upregulation of the procoagulant pathway, downregulation of anticoagulant pathway (namely, ATIII, protein C, and S system), and decreased fibrinolysis. Coagulation is regulated by three main anticoagulant mechanisms: antithrombin, the protein C system, and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The loss of physiologic anticoagulation in sepsis results from the action of several humoral (IL1-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL6, C-reactive protein) and cellular (vascular endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, and platelet) pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, monocytes and macrophages are the main source of tissue factor (TF) a potent thrombin generator via the VII (extrinsic) pathway. The widespread fibrin deposition causes the formation of microthrombi with diffuse microcirculatory flow disturbance. TF is a membrane-bound protein that possesses the most important procoagulant activity [217] . After its expression on the cellular membranes, it forms complexes with the circulating factor VII of the coagulation cascade (extrinsic pathway) thus activating the formation of thrombin [218] . TF is abundant in the subcutaneous tissue and virtually in all blood-tissue barrier [219] . As seen above, TF is also inducible on monocyte and macrophage surfaces. In meningococcal septicemia, large quantities of TF have been localized in microparticles (MPs) shed from platelets and leukocyte aggregates [220] . After trauma or infection, large amount of TF can be expressed by the denuded endothelium, damaged subcutaneous, and muscular tissues with priming of the coagulation cascade. Similarly, sepsis can induce disseminated intravascular coagulation by cytokines production and monocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium with further TF expression. After thrombin formation, the von Willebrand factor (vWf) is released from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. vWf binds to platelet glycoprotein IIb to stabilize the adhesion of platelets and entrapped white blood cells aggregates to the injured endothelium [221] . Normally vWf multimers are cleaved by the protein complex ADAMTS13, and this process is stimulated under conditions of shear stress. Sepsis is associated with decreased circulating ADAMTS13 levels resulting in increased levels of ultra-large vWf multimers [221] . After adhesion to the endothelium (white thrombus formation), platelets enhances the inflammatory and coagulation cascade by expression of TF on activated monocytes and endothelial cells [222] . Clinical conditions associated with overt DIC are summarized in Table 2 .3.",

This pathogenic mechanism is more adherent to the hyperdynamic circulatory state that follows post-traumatic SIRS and sepsis [239] . Experimental studies suggest that the decrease in glomerular filtration rate in AKI is the result of a disproportionate vasodilation of the efferent than the afferent glomerular arterioles [240] . In normal condition, the vascular tone of afferent and efferent vessels is regulated by humoral intra-glomerular factors (mainly angiotensin, thromboxane A2, and PGI2). The interplay between vasoconstrictor (angiotensin and thromboxane A2) and vasodilator (PGI2) factors causes the tone of efferent vessels to increase with respect to the afferent arterioles. This allows for the glomerular capillary pressure to ensure normal filtration. During SIRS or sepsis, the dilation of the efferent arterioles decreases the glomerular pressure and hence the filtration rate [241] . This pathophysiologic mechanism can explain the positive effects of norepinephrine or vasopressin infusion in patients with SIRS and oliguria. Despite the common belief, norepinephrine and vasopressin have been reported to increase the urinary output in patients with hyperdynamic shock. Their vasoconstrictor effect is probably helpful in restoring the tone of the efferent arteriole with resulting increase of capillary perfusion pressure. In addition to glomerular hemodynamic changes, circulating or locally (mesangial cells) produced TNF\u03b1 induces tubular cell apoptosis with imbalance in water and electrolytes homeostasis [242] . AKI is an important form of organ dysfunction because of its association with high mortality rates. In a multinational, multicenter study, the prevalence of AKI has been estimated to be 5-6% of people with only 40% of them discharged alive [243] . Septic shock is the most common cause of AKI with a prevalence of 65% [244] . Trauma patients who developed AKI showed 29% of mortality rate as compared with 9% of the overall mortality rate [245] .",

The incidence of gastrointestinal dysfunction is difficult to estimate due to the subjective nature of diagnosis and the lack of a clear diagnostic definition. Symptoms and signs of intestinal dysfunction include hyporexia, anorexia, inability to tolerate enteral feeding, decreased intestinal motility, and diarrhea often of hemorrhagic type [246, 247] .

This phenomenon is detrimental because the normal flora protects against the colonization of microbial pathogens thus preventing bacterial translocation (see above) [249] . However, the change of normal flora together with reduced intestinal motility and disruption of normal gut mucosal barrier increase the risk for bacterial translocation and development of MODS. The loss of mucosal barrier function is the result of endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and decreased production of tight junction proteins [250] .",

            "text": "Hepatic dysfunction is schematically divided into two clinical forms: hypoxic hepatitis (HH) and jaundice-induced cholestasis (JIC). HH can result from absolute (e.g., cardiogenic) or relative decrease in cardiac output with reduced oxygen supply to the liver. During septic shock, cardiac output and oxygen delivery are increased albeit not enough to cope with the high oxygen requirement of the liver and the inability of cells to extract oxygen [45] . Moreover, the hepatic arterial buffer response and other vascular mechanisms of defense against portal blood flow reduction are impaired [251] . HH is also the product of oxidative stress after ischemia/reperfusion injury and the action of endotoxin and other inflammatory mediators which lead to activation of Kupffer cells and activation and recruitment of leukocytes. The diagnosis of HH requires: 1. A clinical setting of impaired oxygen delivery (usually due to cardiac and/or respiratory failure) 2. A greater than 20-fold increase in serum aminotransferase activity 3. The exclusion of other causes of liver cell necrosis [252, 253] Another landmark of HH is the acute drop of prothrombin levels which gives origin to a hemorrhagic syndrome [254] . These acute biochemical changes, especially those reflecting acute liver cells necrosis, decrease rapidly within 2 or 3 days and normalize within approximately 2 weeks. The delayed elevation of serum bilirubin is often seen but without apparent jaundice. Jaundice-induced cholestasis is a more subtle form of hepatic jaundice usually associated with severe infections [255, 256] . The increase of bilirubin is a late event in these septic patients [257] , and histological studies reveal the intrahepatic origin of the cholestasis [258] . The reduction of bile salt excretion in the gut is responsible for the atrophy of the mucosal gut barrier [259] with loss of integrity and increased risk of bacterial translocation. Moreover, the gut is deprived by the bacteriostatic action of bile salts with proliferation of pathogens and increased production of endotoxin [260, 261] . This creates a vicious circle that perpetuates the infection and hence further cholestatic liver damage. The production and transport of bile salts are a complex, highly coordinated, and energy-dependent mechanism. During sepsis many of these mechanisms are impaired because of a lack of energy due to hypoxia or hypoperfusion or both [262] . The major limiting factor for the bile flow at the canalicular level is the ATPdependent bile salt export pump that is severely impaired in the septic liver [262] . The severity of hyperbilirubinemia appears directly related to the severity of impairment in the various steps of bile formation. No specific therapies can be recommended for acute liver dysfunction. The most recommended measures are merely supportive including the normalization of perfusion pressure and restoration of oxygen delivery [263] , the maintenance of normal oxygen tension, and serum glucose levels. The early use of enteral nutrition is also helpful in counteracting the atrophy of gut mucosal barrier and reducing the intestinal pathogens [264] .",

Splenectomy and external fixation of bone fractures were quickly performed. During surgery, the blood pressure remained at about 100/60 with an average 120 bpm pulse rate. Despite several liters of crystalloids and transfusion of blood products (4 PRC and 4 FFP), an infusion of norepinephrine up to 0.15 \u03bcg/Kg/min was started. At ICU admission, the patient had stable vital signs (AP 115/50 mmHg) a mild tachicardia (HR 115 bpm), and compensated metabolic acidosis (pH 7.37, PaCO2 30 mmHg) with elevated arterial blood lactates (7 mmol/L). After 12 h from ICU admission, the resuscitation phase appeared complete. At 24 h, fever of 38.8 \u00b0C, leukocytosis 21,000 cells/mm 3 , respiratory alkalosis, and tachycardia prompted the execution of a total body CT scan.",
