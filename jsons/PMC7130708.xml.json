Therefore, considering our inability to predict the next emergence and to contain its possible expansion and collateral effects, a better coordination must be implemented at all levels [2]. The global diffusion of highly resistant bacteria (HRTs) is favoured by large-scale movement of populations either human or animal, as observed for other EIDs such as influenza, but also by agro-food products transport [3]. Some projections suggest that notably highly resistant bacterial (HRB) strains could represent a major cause of global mortality by 2050 [4]. Consequently, the anticipation of emergence and its rapid control become obligations before the emergence reaches an advanced, irreversible and sometimes disastrous stage. The spread of certain EIDs, such as plant diseases and zoonotic infections, now raises fears of very significant international economic consequences and hard-to-control, and sometimes devastating, social consequences [5]. The acceleration of apparition of EIDs over the past 40 years, as a result of globalization, also reveals the strong interconnections that exist between human-, animal-, plant health and their social and ecological environment [6].",

First of all, human may be responsible for these emerging issues, since EIDs often arise from human-environment interactions via agriculture practices and the agro-food industry for example, but also from population movements, wars, etc. He is also a victim of EIDs, with flagrant disparities between Northern and Southern countries in terms of access to knowledge, health care and expertise, high-tech technologies in a context of diminishing development aid funding. Finally, human is an actor through his capacity to develop research and expertise during an EID outbreak and inter-epidemic periods, namely his ability to understand, analyse, comment on the multifactorial determinants, including human behaviour and social attitudes that favour the development of an EID. All this will contribute to human decisions and actions to limit the consequences of EIDs. However, this expertise can be limited by the lack of precise and validated methodology, or when the involved experts limit their analysis to their own fields of competence without considering other relevant and sometimes key elements outside these fields. These elements, and in particular the notion of collegial expertise and structured-decision making, must be reinforced into the functioning of organisations and agencies in charge of managing EIDs being institutional, associative, etc. [7].",

One of the limits of this scientific practise is that the detection of an emerging pathogen is directly correlated with the interest in its detection, which leads to the concept of \u201cknowledge emergence\u201d. This approach has indeed shown its limitations in animal and plant health. Several examples in recent years have shown that the emerging infectious agent (or its vector/host) has sometimes been established for a long time in a given region without any consequences being detected [9], [10]. Another attitude, that still seems to be neglected, would consist in seeking, before the appearance of symptoms in populations, an asymptomatic carrier susceptible to trigger an EID. This ultra-early screening could be a tempting approach because it could potentially reduce the time between the period of \u201cinvisible\u201d presence of an emerging pathogen and its recognition as an EID. However, this approach could be costly and ineffective in situations where a pathogen circulates for a long period of time without any significant consequences.",

The organisations responsible for implementing the response to this EID will thus be able to activate the necessary management measures. Those measures should take into account both existing references and newly acquired data at this stage of development of the emergence (dissemination mode, incubation time, necessary therapeutic resources, etc.) to try to control the dissemination of the EID during this early phase.",

For example, in Europe the expertise and management in plant health often take place at the European community regional level, and are secondarily implanted at the national level. Animal and human health coordination and management appear to be less active, or less visible, at the European scale, even if it exists now for human health a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control created in 2005 and located at Stockholm, Sweden.",

These new methods could revolutionize the detection of future EIDs (see Graham et al., 2019 [13] for a recent illustration). However, it seems necessary to integrate anthropological, sociological and economical elements into massive data analyses in order to make them more in line with the reality of emerging issues and thus more relevant.

Indeed, the perception and integration of cultural elements into the very early phase of managing an emergence, such as the Ebola virus, may have posed difficulties in deploying diagnostic and care devices in the field.
