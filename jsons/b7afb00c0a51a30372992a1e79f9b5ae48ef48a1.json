A variety of viruses, including the influenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, have been associated with clinical syndromes ranging from mild illnesses, such as the common cold, to more severe devastating conditions, such as pneumonia. However, \u223c50% of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and 15%-35% of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in pediatric patients are still without a known etiology [1-3]. Along with inadequate diagnostic methods, this observation also suggests that other respiratory tract infectious agents may exist and remain to be identified. A new respiratory virus, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated in 2001 from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) obtained from young children in The Netherlands [4] . On the basis of morphological, biochemical, and genetic features, hMPV was tentatively classified with avian metapneumovirus (APV), the causative agent of an upper respiratory tract disease in turkeys and other birds [5], in the Metapneumovirus genus. The latter, together with the Pneumovirus genus (containing hRSV as the type species), is Note added in proof. Human metapneumovirus was recently isolated from previously virus-negative nasal wash specimens from 49 (20%) of 248 young children consulting at the Vanderbilt Clinic (Nashville, TN) for lower respiratory tract illnesses [44] . Extrapolation of these results to the entire cohort of patients observed at this institution over a 25-year period (1976-2001) suggests that the prevalence of human metapneumovirus infection was \u223c12% in all outpatient children with lower respiratory tract diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "part of the Pneumovirinae subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae family.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Initial electron microscopic examination of hMPV isolates revealed morphological characteristics consistent with paramyxoviruses.

The SH and G amino acid sequences of hMPV show important variability and share only 28% and 21% identity with their respective APV-C counterparts [8, 13, 14] . It is possible that this important divergence may account for the specific host range of these 2 related metapneumoviruses. Genetic analysis on a large number of hMPV isolates has identified 2 major groups and 2 minor genetic clusters within each group [6, 7] . However, additional investigations are still required to determine whether these genotypes represent different antigenic groups. Recently, the complete nucleotide sequences of hMPV isolates belonging to these 2 major groups were determined [9] .

The virus has also been identified in HIV-infected and nonimmunocompromised children from South Africa [15] . The few seroprevalence surveys from The Netherlands [4] , Japan [16] , and Israel [17] have indicated that virtually all children are infected by 5-10 years of age. In addition, studies have shown that hMPV is not a new pathogen, with serological evidence of human infection dating from 1958 in The Netherlands [4] and viral isolation for the past 10-20 years in Europe and Canada [4, 7] . Cases of severe hMPV infection in adults [7] and of reinfection in immunocompromised subjects [18] suggest that, despite universal infection in childhood, new infections can occur throughout life due to incompletely protective immune responses and/or acquisition of new genotypes. Surveys have in- dicated that hMPV has a seasonal distribution overlapping hRSV circulation, with most cases reported during the winter/ early spring months (table 1) . Although most studies have limited their surveillance to the typical respiratory virus period, our group has shown that 87% of hMPV isolates recovered in cell culture in Quebec, Canada, were recovered during the period of December through May [7] . In addition, we found that outbreaks of hMPV infection tend to peak in early spring over a 4-6 week period, slightly later than outbreaks of hRSV infection, which also are more spread out in time [19] .

Young hospitalized children have been best studied, and hMPV has been generally found in 5%-10% of ARTI cases in that population. However, in one study from Italy, the number of hMPV infections varied widely over a 3-year period and were associated with 7%-43% of hospitalizations for ARTI [20] . The relative role of hMPV in respiratory syndromes of adults has been less studied. In one study from Rochester, New York, hMPV was detected by serological tests and/or RT-PCR in 4.5% of young and elderly adults with ARTI [21] . Interestingly, evidence of hMPV infection was also found by serological testing in almost the same percentage (4.1%) in asymptomatic adults, raising the question of the causative role of hMPV in ARTI in adults. Recent studies by our group indicate that hMPV is rarely identified by RT-PCR in NPAs obtained from asymptomatic young children, with a rate significantly lower than that of subjects with ARTI (!1% vs. 6%) [19, 22] . It is interesting to note that the rates of detection of hMPV have been generally higher in retrospective than prospective studies (table 1) , an observation consistent with some selection bias. Thus, to better define the role of hMPV in various respiratory conditions, large prospective studies using appropriate controls need to be conducted. In addition, testing of all clinical samples (i.e., not only those samples that are found to be negative for other viruses) must be performed. Nevertheless, most studies have so far indicated that hMPV is a frequent cause of severe ARTI, especially in young children. Table 2 summarizes the clinical findings of the first 28 hMPVinfected Canadian subjects retrospectively identified through our virology laboratory. Symptoms of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections have been associated with hMPV in young children, although most reports are biased towards description of the most severe symptomatology in hospitalized subjects. In young hospitalized children, the clinical features associated with hMPV infections are very similar to those of hRSV [19, [23] [24] [25] . Diagnoses of bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonitis, have been most commonly reported. A substantial proportion (up to 50%) of infected children also has concomitant otitis media [19] . Acute wheezing and asthma exacerbation have been associated with hMPV in some [23, 26] but not all [27] studies. Compared with hRSV infections, hMPV cases tend to occur at an older age [19, 26, 28] . The clinical outcome after hRSV infection has been more severe than that after hMPV infection when looking at the proportion of patients with hypoxemia, those with pneumonia, and those admitted to the intensive care unit in studies from Canada [19] and Europe [25, 28] . In contrast, researchers from Hong Kong found that hMPV infection was associated with a longer hospital stay and more cases of pneumonia than was hRSV infection [26] . The latter group reported an estimate of 442 hMPVassociated hospitalizations per 100,000 children aged \u04406 years. Children with underlying medical conditions may have moresevere hMPV disease, leading to hospitalization. In studies from North America, 25%-33% of hMPV cases occurred in children with underlying conditions, such as prematurity, cardiopulmonary problems, and immunosuppression [7, 29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 646, "end": 650, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2196, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2197, "end": 2201, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2202, "end": 2206, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2396, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2481, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2485, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2498, "end": 2502, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2588, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2592, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2596, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2847, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2859, "end": 2863, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2867, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3031, "end": 3035, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3428, "end": 3431, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3435, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 124, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1221, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1701, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY"}, {"text": "hMPV has been associated with flulike illnesses and colds in healthy adults (table 2) [7] .

Furthermore, until an effective vaccine is developed, another interesting strategy could consist in the development of hightitered IVIG preparations with activity against hMPV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 713, "end": 716, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PREVENTION AND TREATMENT"}, {"text": "The recent identification of a presumably old viral pathogen is an exciting development in the field of respiratory viruses.

Overall, the epidemiological and clinical features of hMPV infection appear to be similar to those of hRSV, although differences have been noted.
