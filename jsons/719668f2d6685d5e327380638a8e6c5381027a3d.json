The Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, including those in the respiratory tract, thus representing a potential target to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 [13] . At the same time, the DPP4 is the target of incretin-based therapies, and this opened the discussion whether DPP4inhibitors, currently used for the treatment of people with type-2 diabetes (T2DM) may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the scientific community is cautious about this hypothesis, since this speculation is based on preclinical data, and clinical data is therefore needed. In addition, it has to be highlighted that GLP-1 receptor analogues have shown over the years significant antiinflammatory and anti-adipogenic effects, thus decreasing insulin resistance [14] [15] . The effect of reducing the inflammatory stress and the peripheral insulin resistance by lowering the infiltrate with macrophage, via GLP-1 dependent signaling by regulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization, have been described with DPP4 inhibition and GLP-1 activation [16] . Similar evidence on the effect on inflammation is also available for the SGLT-2i [17] and pioglitazone [18] . Therefore, waiting for specific clinical data, certainly it is the case to balance between the potential dangerous effects of some drugs, supported mainly by experimental data, and the proven effects of the drugs on the cardiovascular system and the kidney, as well as their potential anti-inflammatory action.",

            "text": "Smith et al. in 1987 described a significant improvement of glycemic values in few patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus treated with HCQ [19] . This finding was then reinforced by Quatraro et al. in a study published in 1990 in T2DM treated with insulin or glibenclamide associated to HCQ for six months, where the authors found a significant decrease in HbA1c by 3.3% compared to placebo, and a reduction in insulin dosages by 30% [20] . Therefore, the antiglycemic effect of HCQ is worth of investigation in clinical studies on COVID-19 in people with diabetes; HCQ, if safely used, may also contribute to an improvement of diabetes control",

Therefore, it is a scientific and clinical need to obtain data on the antidiabetic treatments used so far in T2DM patients affected by COVID-19, and particularly to clarify whether the use of the new therapies in such people is correlated, or not, to a better prognosis and less severe forms of the disease.",
