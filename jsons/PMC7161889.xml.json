Considering patients with a positive NPA pre\u2010HSCT, for 11/14 (79%) deceased patients, the cause of death was attributed to VRI, while two died of fungal pneumonia and one of lung GvHD/transplant\u2010associated microangiopathy. Overall, LRTI\u2010associated mortality was higher in patients with pre\u2010HSCT active URTIs and in children that were NPA positive after transplant (24\u00b76% vs. 8\u00b74%, HR 4\u00b71, CI 95 1\u00b76\u201312, P < 0\u00b7005) (Fig 3A). In order to evaluate the impact of different risk factors on patients that died due to transplant complications in the first 100 days after HSCT (100\u2010day TRM) and progression to LRTI we performed a univariate analysis on different variables (Table 3). NPA positivity at the time of transplant was a significant risk factor for early mortality related to transplant complications, as well as the use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as stem cell source and the use of HLA mismatched donors. On multivariate analysis, only NPA positivity and the use of HLA mismatched donors were independently associated with early TRM (Table 3). We also investigated the impact of rhinovirus infection on outcome (Fig 3B). Early TRM was lower for patients with pre\u2010transplant NPA positive for rhinovirus (12%) as compared with patients with other VRI (34%) starting conditioning, although this did not reach significance (P = 0\u00b707). However, no differences were noted with patients with pre\u2010HSCT negative NPA (100\u2010day TRM 6%, P = 0\u00b73).

We extensively analysed the outcome of a sub\u2010group of patients with a positive NPA screen before HSCT over a 10\u2010year period. We found that pre\u2010transplant viral infections had a profound impact on clinical outcomes, leading to lower OS and higher 100\u2010day TRM, compared to patients that experienced a de novo viral infection after HSCT.

Indeed, Campbell et al (2015) reported a higher prevalence of pre\u2010transplant positivity of respiratory virus screening, especially in children. However, in their study only a minority of patients were <18 years old (52/458, 11%). Of note, in this study, a higher mortality rate in children with pre\u2010BMT viral infections was also reported, compared to adults. In our study, newly occurring VRIs were mainly documented in the early phase after HSCT and prevalence was comparable to the one recently described in children receiving HSCT (16\u00b76%) (Fisher et al, 2018). Interestingly, in this study, early infections within the first 60 days after transplant were associated with higher morbidity and mortality, supporting the crucial impact of immune status for the outcome of patients with RVIs.",

We showed that starting conditioning with an active upper airways respiratory infection can lead more frequently to pulmonary involvement, irrespective of background diagnosis, HLA matching and occurrence of GvHD. Use of UCB was only partially associated with higher rate of LRTI and this could be related to the lower cell dose and delayed lymphocytes engraftment (Nichols et al, 2004; Kim et al, 2014). Interestingly, a higher rate of intensive care needs for patients with a positive NPA screen was also observed.",

This difference is unlikely to reflect a selection bias for better risk patients: when we looked at early TRM, progression to LRTI was the main cause of graft failure in the NPA+ group, and three other patients died due to pulmonary complications. Accordingly, risk factors analysis showed that a pre\u2010transplant positive NPA was a major risk factor for early mortality. The more severe clinical course in patients with a respiratory virus documented in the upper airways before transplant could be related to the younger age of this sub\u2010group of patients, given that age <2 years has been associated with dismal outcome of VRI (El Saleeby et al, 2008). However, patients who experienced a viral infection after transplant were not significantly older, with a median age <2 years.",

            "text": "European guidelines only provide weak recommendations for postponing conditioning in case of VRI (Hirsch et al., 2013) and transplant delay can be controversial, because some patients cannot postpone the procedure (e.g. patients affected by aggressive malignant disorders) or do not present immunological competence to clear the virus (e.g. patients with SCID). Nevertheless, in case of influenza or RSV infection, a delay of HSCT can allow pharmacological treatment (i.e. Oseltamivir and Ribavirin, respectively). Unfortunately, for most viruses there is no effective treatment available, and viral clearance is dependent on the efficacy of the host's immune system. Especially for patients with PID, that can more frequently present with chronic/refractory VRIs, balance of risk/benefit ratio is challenging because viral clearance is unlikely in SCID patients but can occur in the presence of a residual T cell immunity. Only one study reported the efficacy of transplant delay in 37 adults and children with RSV URTI before conditioning, showing that survival was significantly improved compared to those who encountered the virus after transplant (Peck et al, 2004). Whether to postpone HSCT because of a positive NPA for rhinovirus is more debatable, since LRTI progression is not frequent. However, rhinovirus\u2010associated lower airways infection before transplant can lead to a worsen outcome (Seo et al, 2017; Mowrer et al, 2018). However, our data, although retrospective and limited to a small cohort of patients, show that pre\u2010HSCT rhinovirus infection is associated with a modestly lower TRM as compared to other viral strains involved in URTI, and is overall comparable to that of patients with a negative NPA screen.",

Faster immune reconstitution is usually expected when in vivo T\u2010cell depletion is omitted or administered early during conditioning (Lindemans et al, 2014). GvHD prophylaxis with alemtuzumab results in delayed lymphocytes recovery when compared to anti\u2010thymocyte globulin (Shah et al, 2007), and decisions regarding in vivo T\u2010cell depletion strategy should balance the risk of GvHD versus the burden of active viral infections. Ex vivo manipulation of the graft, selectively depleting alloreactive cells and allowing the presence of gamma/delta T cells in the graft, can tackle post\u2010transplant infections (Bertaina et al, 2014; Locatelli et al, 2017), and turning\u2010off T cell with an inducer of dimerization, have also been developed (Zhou et al, 2015). Finally, non\u2010myeloablative and reduced\u2010intensity conditioning regimens could limit organ toxicity and allow transplant also in patients with severe infections (i.e. PID patients), although the risk of engraftment failure with an active viral infection should be contemplated. However, prospective data are necessary to evaluate the impact of in vivo and ex vivo T\u2010cell depletion on VRIs and no recommendation on the best strategy can be made.",
