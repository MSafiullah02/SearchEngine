Thus, gross and histopathological kidney lesions and mortality were used to assess nephropathogenicity (Chong and Apostolov, 1982; Ignjatovi\u0107 and Sapats, 2000; Ignjatovic et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2006a; Zaher and Girh, 2014). In this study, the chicken challenge experiment showed high morbidity (85%) and mortality (80%) in one-day-old chickens, with similar clinical signs to field outbreak. All virus challenged chickens did not show prominent respiratory infection signs, such as sneezing, gasping, or coughing. At necropsy, there was no presence of pus or mucous clogging visually at the bronchi bifurcation region or in the trachea, as described (Grgi\u00e6 et al., 2008). The kidneys were highly inflamed and distended with uric acids deposits, indicating that this isolate had strong tropism to kidneys, as previously reported (Liu and Kong, 2004). Histopathological examination showed nephritis, necrosis, and monocytes infiltration in epithelial tissues in the kidneys, which were similar to previous reports (Benyeda et al., 2009). This demonstrated that this new isolated IBV strain belongs to high a nephropathogenic strain emerging from circulating field IBV strains.",
