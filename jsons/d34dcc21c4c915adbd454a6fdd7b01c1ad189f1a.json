This pandemic has affected thousands of peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease. The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain and breathing problems, and ultimately leading to pneumonia. This, being a new viral disease affecting humans for the first time, vaccines are not yet available. Thus, the emphasis is on taking extensive precautions like extensive hygiene protocol (e.g., regularly washing of hands, avoidance of face to face interaction etc.), social distancing and wearing of masks etc. This virus is spreading exponentially region wise. Countries are banning gatherings of people to the spread and break the exponential curve 1,2 . Many countries are locking their population and enforcing strict quarantine to control the spread of the havoc of this highly communicable disease.",
