Not only have hospitals and health systems needed to dramatically alter workflows and practice settings to protect and treat patients, but they also have had to seek measures to protect the physical health and emotional well-being of frontline workers. Physicians, nurses, and other health care workers play critical roles in the response to the pandemic as they detect, contain, and treat serious infectious disease, despite elevated personal risk. As our hospital systems become overwhelmed by the virus-running well over capacity and facing shortages of critical care medical resources, limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), and grief over deaths of fellow clinicians-we are observing and anticipating enormous and unabated psychological stressors that necessitate the rapid development and scaling up of a robust model of wellbeing support for staff.",

While our health system made available and provided numerous psychosocial and mental health support resources before the pandemic (e.g., Employee Assistance Program, psychiatry services, spiritual care), the enormous stress and emotional strain on both clinicians and nonclinical employees has prompted the task force to scale up existing resources and provide additional resources. These include an array of offerings that range from simple self-care resources (e.g., mindfulness activities) to virtual support groups facilitated by social workers and psychologists and to one-on-one counseling sessions and 24/7 immediate crisis management.
