Reduced liquid capital for new installations, disrupted supply chains in the Chinese manufacturing sector\u2014which provides the majority of silicon used in photovoltaics\u2014and lessened global energy demand may stunt the seemingly irreversible momentum of renewables. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has already lowered their 2020 PV demand forecast from a range of 121\u2013152 GW to 108\u2013143 GW.1 The PV industry may have hit some recent snags that could affect near-term demand, but its long-term prospects to provide an increasing proportion of energy production remain promising.",

As the price of PV has continued to rapidly decrease, the majority of the cost is not in the module itself but in the balance of systems\u2014installation labor, mounting structures, and external electrical components. Perhaps the greatest opportunity to further decrease the LCOE of PV is to increase its efficiency, but this is a challenging undertaking.",

The highest lab-scale results for c-Si to date are 26.7%,5 and most commercial modules are in the 20% efficiency range. Increasing the performance of silicon solar cells is challenging and doing so without radically altering the manufacturing process of existing PV plants adds further complication. An alternative approach is to take a commercial silicon solar cell and connect it in tandem with one or more different solar cells with a complementary absorption profile. Tandem solar cells are designed such that each sub cell harnesses photons closer to its absorption band-edge to reduce thermalization losses.",

Metal halide perovskites were introduced as a solar-harvesting material roughly a decade ago.6 Today they are the most efficient third-generation photovoltaic technology. Unlike crystalline silicon, metal halide perovskites are strong solar absorbers, enabling thin-film and lightweight PV. They can be manufactured using low-temperature processing from solution or vacuum, potentially enabling low-cost mass manufacturing. Their promising optoelectronic properties have enabled rapid advances in PV performance, boasting efficiencies up to 25.2% single junction and up to 29.1% for tandems with c-Si, both results presently unpublished.7\n",

The process employed by Xu et al. was to alloy a FA/Cs/Pb/I/Br-based perovskite with MAPbCl3 to increase its bandgap and improve its optoelectronic properties. This was integrated into a single-side textured c-Si bottom cell and capped with a textured polydimethylsiloxane encapsulating layer. The best-performing cell achieved a single-scan efficiency of 27% at 1 cm2 (certified as 25.8% stabilized efficiency after 1 month of storage in an inert environment). The strategy employed by Hou et al. was to fabricate perovskites directly onto double-sided textured c-Si bottom cells and introduce a top-passivating layer, realizing a best certified efficiency of 25.7%. Unlike previous work that relied on co-evaporation10 or blade coating,11 this effort demonstrates that highly accessible spin coating can sufficiently cover fully textured silicon.",
