It has been classified in the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, and genus Bocavirus by genetic organization and sequence homology. Other parvoviruses infecting humans included the adeno-associated viruses, the well-known pathogen parvovirus B19, and the recently discovered human parvovirus 4 [3]. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes, four species of HBoVs (HBoV1\u20134) have been identified [4], among which HBoV-1 was mainly identified in respiratory specimens from children with acute respiratory disease [5\u20137]. According to previous studies, HBoV-1 has a global distribution, with prevalences varying considerably from 1.5 % to 45.7 % in ARTI patients [5, 6, 8\u201314]. However, its role as a causative agent of respiratory tract diseases is frequently questioned due to its concurrent detection with other potential pathogens. Possible interactions between HBoV-1 and other viruses remained rarely investigated.",

The pneumonia was defined by the presence of patchy alveolar opacities on chest radiographs, in addition to presenting symptoms of cough, dyspnea (lower chest wall indrawing), or tachypnea (in infants, >50\u201360 breaths/min; in older children, >40 breaths/min). Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia plus hypoxemia (maintained SaO2 < 92 % in air) or rising respiratory and pulse rates with clinical evidence of respiratory distress and exhaustion with or without raised PaCO2. The definition of an attack was used as an episode of respiratory symptoms which prompts an urgent consultation with a doctor, is of sufficient severity to prevent the patient working/attending school/performing domestic duties/playing, and results in increased use of anti-asthma medication.",

Although this temporal pattern coincided with the epidemic peaks of influenza circulation in southern China (http://www.cnic.org.cn/chn/), the single detection of HBoV also demonstrated a similar temporal pattern after excluding the effect from other respiratory pathogens, therefore indicating the actual seasonal pattern predominantly occurring in summer. An unexpected low peak in the winter of 2010 was demonstrated, probably caused by the extremely cold weather in Chongqing during the winter of that year (http://www.cqmb.gov.cn/ecms/stny/nyqx/2011-03-11/3683.html).",

Instead, HBoV-1 tended to cause more upper respiratory tract infections, and its infection was also related with asthma exacerbation. Although a causal relationship between HBoV-1 infection and asthma cannot be concluded based on the statistical results, their significant association suggest the need for further investigation. Prospective longitudinal studies will hopefully increase our understanding of what, if any, role HBoV plays in asthma.",

Analysis of the genomic and epidemiological data of HBoV-1 from the current study, as well as those available from different localities, revealed limited heterogeneity, and high conservation was demonstrated from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Zehender et al. reported that the estimated mean evolutionary rate of the HBoV-1 VP2 gene was 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 s/s/y using 48 non-recombinant isolates [28], demonstrating that HBoV-1 was characterized by a rapid evolution. The rate identified in the current study is slower, which might be partially caused by the sample size of analyzed HBoV-1 sequences. A few of the previous studies explored the estimated evolutionary rates of parvoviruses in carnivore parvoviruses (7.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\u20131.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 s/s/y) [29] and human parvovirus B19 (1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20132.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 s/s/y) [30]. The estimated mean evolutionary rates of the complete genome, VP1, VP2, and NS genes of HBoV-1 were similar to those of carnivore parvoviruses and human parvovirus B19. The NS gene was highly conservative among the four genes. Surprisingly, the NP gene showed a slightly higher substitution rate than the other genes.",

A conserved phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif, which resembles the catalytic motif of secreted PLA2 (sPLA2), has been identified in the VP1U of most parvoviruses [31]. For HBoV-1, VP1 and VP2 have the same sequence of 542 aa at the C termini, while VP1 has an additional 129 aa peptide at the N-terminus. One study indicated that the VP1U of HBoV-1 also had sPLA2-like enzymatic activity, and these residues are crucial for its sPLA2-like activity [32]. Mutation of one of the amino acids (21Pro, 41His, 42Asp, or 63Asp) in the VP1U almost eliminated the sPLA2 activity of the HBoV-1 VP1U. Interestingly enough, one positive selection site (codon 40) was identified near codon 41 and 42 in the current study, which indicated a high probability of VP1U undergoing selective pressure. In spite of this finding, the associations between the positive selection site and sPLA2 activity or amplification of DNA need further investigation.",
