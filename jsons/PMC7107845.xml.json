Infants 6\u201336 months of age were studied prospectively for 1 year. These otherwise healthy infants were examined as soon as possible after symptoms of a new URI developed. A combination of viral culture and molecular methods were used to identify the viruses causing the URI. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was obtained to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization with the usual pathogens associated with AOM.",

Of the 2 conditions, OME is more common, occurring both before and after AOM and also occurring without ever progressing to AOM [10]. The middle ear fluid in children with OME is sterile. OME is a nonbacterial inflammatory state that resolves spontaneously over time. The principal importance of OME is as a cause of hearing problems in young children and as a confounder in the diagnosis of AOM [10]. Antibiotics are neither appropriate nor beneficial in children with OME [11]. In contrast, in children with AOM, the probability of bacterial infection is very high, thereby enhancing the likelihood of a benefit from antibiotics.",

            "text": "A preceding viral URI is very important in most cases of ABS. The preceding URI causes a mucositis of the membranes that line the nose and the paranasal sinuses [20]. Although in almost all instances, the mucositis resolves spontaneously, in some cases, it results in obstruction of the sinus ostia. When there is a functional or mechanical obstruction of the paranasal sinus ostia, there is a transient increase in pressure in the sinus cavity followed quickly by the development of negative pressure in the sinus cavity. This negative pressure evolves because the oxygen component of the air is rapidly absorbed, leaving the pressure in the sinus negative by the partial pressure of oxygen. This negative pressure relative to the positive or atmospheric pressure in the nose or nasopharynx favors aspiration of the mucus laden with bacteria, from the nasal cavity in to the maxillary sinuses during sniffing and nose-blowing, resulting in contamination of the paranasal sinus [21]. If the mucociliary apparatus was functioning normally, this material would be swept out again. However, in the face of obstruction of the sinus ostia, the bacteria begin to multiply and secondary bacterial sinusitis develops. Studies from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, have shown that ABS likely complicates viral URI in children 6\u201336 months of age in 8% of children [19]. These results are similar to those of Wald et al [22]. However, studies of the epidemiology of ABS have not been done in older children. There have not been comparable studies to those performed for children with AOM in which the precise viral isolates have been identified in children who subsequently develop ABS. Nor have there been elaborate studies of the nasopharyngeal colonization in children with ABS.",

This is done in children by sterilizing the area beneath the inferior nasal turbinate and passing a trocar through the medial wall of the nose into the sinus cavity (Figure 9) [23]. Infection is defined as the recovery of bacterial species in high colony count to assure that the bacterial species implicated derive from the sinuses rather than from contaminating bacteria inadvertently picked up in the nose. Studies performed in the United States in the early 1980s defined the microbiology of ABS by performing this procedure in 50 children [23]. This is a potentially hazardous procedure in children because (1) there are no landmarks in the nasal cavity to guide the position of the needle and (2) the distance between the middle and lateral walls of the sinus may be <10 mm in small children. This procedure should only be done by a skilled pediatric otolaryngologist and requires sedation in most children [20].",
