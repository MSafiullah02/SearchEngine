On Apr 4, the patient developed an acute respiratory failure and underwent a chest CT-scan that showed a segmental pulmonary embolus in the right superior lobe, other than a ground-glass opacification and early parenchymal consolidation at lower lobes of the lungs. Laboratory tests did not vary compared to those at admission, except for the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and an increase of ferritin concentration (Table 1) .
