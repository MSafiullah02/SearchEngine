Antigen-specific human memory B cells (CD19+CD27+) were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of seven healthy donors using tetramerized H3 (A/Brisbane/10/07) trimers; only 0.19\u20131.08% of memory B cells were reactive with H3 (Table 1). These B cells were sorted into 384-well plates at the density of one cell per well and cultured in the presence of irradiated CD40L-transfected cells. After 14 days, 1051 (39.1% in 2,688 cultures) culture supernatants derived from seven donors were found to secrete IgG or IgM and were sequentially tested for reactivity with H3 (A/Brisbane/10/07), H7 (A/Canada/RV444/04), H1 (A/California/04/09) and HA of influenza B (B/Malaysia/2506/04). Through this screen, 237 (22.55%) expanded memory B cells were found to secrete Igs that bound to H3 (Table 1). This in vitro expansion step resulted in a 37-fold increase in H3-reactive B cell recovery compared with 0.61% recovery by sorting plus RT\u2013PCR only (data not shown). The average percentage of cross-reactive clones within the group 2 strains H3/H7 was 18.14%. Remarkably, 13.08 and 8.44% of the H3-binding clones showed hetero-subtypic binding to group 1 H1 strains and H7/H1 strains, respectively. Only 3.38% H3-reactive (H3+) clones were found to also bind influenza B. Next, the supernatants of memory B-cell clones that showed hetero-subtypic binding were tested for microneutralization against H3N2 (A/Brisbane/10/07). One bnAb, 3I14, derived from donor 3 that showed H3/H7/H1 cross-reactivity and neutralization was further characterized.",

We further performed the binding competition assay between 3I14 and other stem-directed bnAbs: FI6v3, CR9114, 39.29, F10 and CR8020 (Fig. 2). 3I14 Fab strongly inhibits the binding of other anti-stem Abs CR9114, FI6v3 and 39.29 to H3-BR07 but not with the head-directed, anti-H3 mAb E730 (unpublished antibody sequence) (Fig. 2a\u2013d). 3I14 also competes with CR8020, which is directed against a more membrane-proximal epitope14. 3I14 partially inhibits the binding of 39.29 and F10 to H5-VN04 but does not inhibit the binding of the anti-H5 head antibody 2A (ref. 12) (Fig. 2e,f). These results demonstrate that 3I14 is overlapping with or very close to the known stem epitopes of other bnAbs. In addition, 3I14 potently inhibited other bnAbs binding to H3 and moderately inhibited binding to H5. These results are consistent with the affinity measurements of 3I14 binding to H3 and H5.",

            "text": "Stem-directed bnAbs are known to interfere with pH-dependent conformational changes and membrane fusion of HA121416. Cleavage of the precursor HA0 primes HA for subsequent activation of membrane fusion in the acidic endosome environment. Immature HA0 is normally processed by surface protease on respiratory epithelial cells to HA1 and HA2 (refs 30, 31), which is mimicked experimentally by treatment of HA0 with trypsin32. Since 3I14 targets the stem domain of HA comprising the HA0 cleavage site and the HA2 N-terminal fusion peptide, we tested whether 3I14 could also block trypsin cleavage activation of HA0 or interfere with HA-mediated virus-host membrane fusion. Figure 4a shows that 3I14 IgG1 but not control anti-SARS IgG1 (Fm-6) prevented cleavage of immature HA0. We also analysed 3I14's prevention of low-pH-triggered conformational rearrangements using the surface-expressed H3-A2/68 and H3-BR07. Figure 4b (upper) illustrates that 3I14 binds to both uncleaved HA precursor (HA0) (left) and two mature forms (HA), either after trypsin activation alone (left middle) or when followed by low-pH trigger (right middle). In contrast, it did not bind to dissociated HA2 mediated by DTT reduction (right). As expected, when 3I14 is pre-bound to mature HAs before low-pH trigger, the antibody maintained binding after DTT treatment (Fig. 4b, fourth panel), indicating that 3I14 inhibits the pH-dependent HA rearrangement (Fig. 4b, lower). In addition, pre-binding of 3I14 apparently prevented HA1-HA2 dissociation, because binding of E730 Ab (anti-HA1) was preserved after DTT treatment (Fig. 4b lower). From these data we conclude that 3I14 binding to the HA stem epitope leads to inhibition of HA0 cleavage and pH-dependent conformational changes.",

To investigate the properties of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by 3I14 and other anti-stem bnAbs, we performed PBMC-based ADCC assay (Fig. 5) and a surrogate reporter-based assay (Supplementary Fig. 6) using HA-expressing 293T cells as targets. Following incubation with H3-expressing 293T target cells, 3I14 induced a significant lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity response and luciferase signals in a dose-dependent manner and at a comparable level to other anti-stem bnAbs including FI6v3, CR9114, 39.29 and group 2 mAb CR8020 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6, upper panels). The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by the lack of response from anti-group 1 mAb, F10. 3I14 also specifically induced the ADCC activity against H5-expressed 293T cells mediated by human PBMCs, which can reach 40% of total cell lysis. A group control, CR8020 did not have shown this property (Fig. 5, lower panel). We also observed 3I14 induced luciferase reactivity against H5-expressed 293T target cells (Supplementary Fig. 6, lower panel). These data support that 3I14 engages an Fc-dependent immune-mediated mechanism similar to other anti-stem bnAbs33.",

These changes in 3I14-GL binding affinity to H3 and H1 were predominantly caused by an increase and decrease in dissociation rate constant (Koff) by 13.9- or 7.5-fold, respectively.

In addition, both the heavy and light chain chimeras resulted in essentially irreversible binding to H1 with Koff<1.0E-7 s\u22121. However, in the case of H5, VL mutations contribute more to the affinity increase than VH mutations (7.5-fold versus 1.9-fold) due to a 5.2-fold and 2.2-fold decrease in Koff, respectively. From these studies we conclude that 3I14-GL shows higher affinity binding to H1 and moderate affinity to H3 with changes in Koff being largely responsible for kinetic differences to compare to 3I14-WT. For H5 binding, the SHMs in 3I14 are absolutely required for binding with VL mutations providing a greater contribution to binding than VH changes. All changes in binding affinity to H1, H3 and H5 are mainly the consequence of changes in dissociation rate (Koff) constants.",

Since 3I14 competes with FI6v3 and 39.29 for binding to H3 and H5, and MAb 3.1 occupies the same conserved epitope with FI6v3 and 39.29 (ref. 18), we hypothesized that 3I14 adopts a similar binding scheme to interact with H3/H5 as FI6v3, 39.29 and MAb 3.1. For these three Ab-HA co-crystal structures, HCDR3 plays a major role in forming a hydrophobic core with the fusion peptide and helix A151718. Rather than making significant interactions with HA, HCDR1 and HCDR2 appear to stabilize the HCDR3 loop to facilitate binding. The hydrophilic light chain CDR residues also interact with HA and surround the hydrophobic core; however, the orientation of the light chains are not conserved nor are the residues involved in binding. These observations suggest that the light chains mainly contribute to the binding by orienting the HCDR3 to an optimal position to interact with the epitope.",

Energetic calculations36 show very favourable binding contributions between D94 of 3I14 light chain and K39 in the H3 model, which may form a salt bridge while E39 is rotating away from D94 in the H5/3I14 model due to the electrical repulsion and may be unfavourable for H5 binding (Fig. 6c). In addition to H5, the E39 amino acid change is also found in group 1 H2, H6, H11 and H13 strains (Supplementary Table 2). Another striking variation is at H3 position L38, where this residue is changed to K/R38 for some group 1 strains (Supplementary Table 2). However, the binding contribution shows L/K38 contacts HCDR3 residues Y104, F105 and F109 in both models with favourable to very favourable binding (\u223c70% of the total favourable free energy) and therefore we considered these residues to have a positive effect on binding to both HAs.",

If pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) secreted by long-lived plasma cells are insufficient to bind and eliminate the invading microbe, pathogen-specific memory B cells will rapidly undergo proliferation and differentiation to produce nAbs24. Compared with long-lived plasma cells, memory B cells provide broader antibody responses through affinity maturation. In this study, we analysed the cross-reactivity of 237 H3-reactive memory B cells from seven healthy donors and found that 20 (8.44%) also bound H7 and H1 HAs. This H3/H7/H1 hetero-subtypic population corresponds to 46.5% (43 clones) of H3/H7 binding and 64.5% (31 clones) of H3/H1 binding populations (Table 1). This broad reactivity represents an unexpectedly high level of hetero-subtypic group 2 and groups 2/1 influenza A binding clones than might be expected based on published plasmablast cell studies3738. These memory B-cell frequencies are also particularly remarkable since the blood samples were not harvested immediately post seasonal vaccination. Other memory B-cell clones including H3-reactive B cells that cross bind to influenza B, while found at lower levels (3.38%), represent an important finding that requires further evaluation as they may represent an important population to elicit with universal influenza vaccines.",

There are a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of the IGHV3-30 alleles that result in amino acid changes but only one CDR residue at position 33 in HCDR1 has A/G variance among the alleles. On the basis of three crystal structures and our 3I14 modelling, position 33 does not appear to be directly involved in HA binding. Whether variable levels of IGHV3-30 Abs exist in the expressed Ab repertoires of individuals that encode different IGHV3-30 alleles due to variances in the noncoding regions that may affect transcription/recombination will require additional investigations to answer.",

            "text": "There are notable similarities and differences among the stem-directed bnAbs encoded by IGHV1-69 and IGHV3-30 in their structures, V segment SHMs39 (Supplementary Table 3) and involvement of light chains in binding. The majority of stem-directed IGHV1-69 bnAbs have broad hetero-subtypic binding and neutralization activity against group 1 influenza A strains2939, although two IGHV1-69 BnAbs- CR9114 (ref. 16) and MAb 1.12 (ref. 19) -generated from human-derived phage display libraries have broader activity with groups 1 and 2 activity. For their heavy chains, several studies have shown that IGHV1-69 bnAbs require two anchor residues: F54 in HCDR2 and a properly positioned tyrosine in HCDR3, as well as a hydrophobic amino acid at position 53 and a minimal number of signature mutations in CDR1/2 to generate high-affinity antibodies293940. In contrast to IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies, IGHV3-30 bnAbs utilize HCDR3 to form a hydrophobic core that contributes to HA binding151718 and possess a longer HCDR3 due to a large amount of N-insertions in the VDJ junctions151829. For IGHV1-69-encoded bnAbs, F10, CR6261, CR9114 and MAb 1.12, the light chains can be replaced without affinity impairments12131940. A distinguishing feature of 3I14 as well as the other IGHV3-30 bnAbs is that the light chains are important for binding both when in germline configuration and as shown with 3I14 when SHMs are introduced which leads to broadening of its antigenic breadth (Table 2). Specifically, the 3I14 chiral S31 in VL germline LCDR1 likely applies tension to the binding interface and sequentially changes the coordinates of the main chain (Supplementary Fig. 2), which may lead to a failure to provide flexibility for conformational changes on HA binding that could result in fast dissociation rates (Table 2). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, this liability is overcome by the G31 substitution in WT 3I14, which leads to strong interactions with Q42 and D46 of H5. Other mutations in the light chain are buried in the interior of the antibody and may not contribute to the binding to HA. Further, our structure-based modification, D94N in LCDR3, also provided the same binding improvement towards H5 (Table 3). N94 can compensate for the electrostatic repulsive force between E39 in H5 and D94 in 3I14, facilitating the assembly of H5-3I14 complex. This D94N mutation could be generated in somatic B cells in vivo by activation-induced deamination (AID) U:G mismatch repair41. By constructing an antibody mutant through single site mutagenesis, we show that a point mutation in LCDR3 is sufficient to increase H5 binding affinity by mimicking the similar molecular mechanisms of SHM.",

Unlike FI6v3 and 39.29, however, 3I14 mAb shows lower binding and neutralizing activities to some group 1 viral subtypes, such as H5. The 3I14 germline reversion lacks binding affinity to H5 but retains its strong reactivity with H3/H1, suggesting the 3I14 clone was selected by high-affinity binding to H3 and/or H1 and the accumulation of SHMs conferred broader neutralizing activity against the H5 subtypes. Therefore, we speculate that in this H5N1 naive donor stochastic rather than an induced process resulted in the acquisition of H5 binding. This observation also builds on classic studies that the diversity of memory BCRs increases by accumulating selectable and unselectable mutations during the antigen recalling responses42.",

            "text": "In summary, the isolation and characterization of 3I14 mAb suggests that memory B cells may continuously undergo intraclonal diversification via accumulation of SHMs to broaden antibody reactivity against divergent influenza viruses. Interestingly, 3I14-like memory B cells could significantly enhance H5 reactivity through SHMs, while at the same time, reduce their inherent higher affinity for H1. To maintain a broader bnAb repertoire against rapidly diversifying seasonal viruses or potentially pandemic viruses, 3I14-like memory B cells are a general pool that we wish to preserve and expand in that they are not terminally committed to any HA subtype; rather they maintain a plasticity potential that can be evoked by minimal additional SHMs. This is supported by our back-mutation studies that show 3I14 GL antibody has broad activity against H1 and H3 subtypes and has the potential to gain broader activity against H5. This is a distinguishing feature from the GL version of plasma-derived FI6 and other bnAbs which greatly loose activity against some subtypes while maintaining strong activity against other subtypes1529. We propose an improved vaccination strategy that preferentially targets the HA stem may maintain the longevity of 3I14-like and other anti-stem memory B cells. For example, sequential vaccination with chimeric HAs (cHA) may allow these subdominant memory B cells to preferentially expand4344. Likewise, direct focusing of Ab repertoires on the HA stem domain by vaccination with headless HAs may achieve a similar goal4546. Additionally, targeting influenza A vaccines to a naive pool of IGHV3-30 B cells that provide strong initial binding energy through their BCR H/L CDR3 motifs may prove useful. These vaccine approaches may have the advantage of preventing the memory B cell loss that is further compounded by HA antigen induced expansion of abundant anti-head memory B cell clones4748. A different strategy may be to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which has been reported to modify the nAb repertoire and increase the frequency of Abs potentially cross-reactive to conserved stem epitopes4950. Only future research on the biological, molecular and genetic composition of HA-specific memory B cells and their evolution will reveal how to properly elicit bnAbs in the development of \u2018universal' influenza vaccines51.",

As target cells, 2 \u00d7 104/well H3- or H5- expressed 293T cells were attached to the solid round bottom 96-well plates before assay, and the medium was then replaced with low IgG Serum assay buffer (RPMI 1640 with 0.5% low IgG FBS). The scFvFc antibodies were added to each well at 10, 5, 2.5 and 1.25 \u03bcg ml\u22121 final concentration. After one-hour, PBMCs were added for 1.2 \u00d7 105/well to assay plates in Low IgG Serum assay buffer and incubated for 6 h. The supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 300g and measured using LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) at 490 and 680 nm by the Benchmark Plus Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The LDH activity was determined by subtracting the 680 nm absorbance value (background) from the 490 nm absorbance reading. The per cent cytotoxicity was calculated as: %Cytotoxicity=100 \u00d7 (E\u2013s.e.\u2013ST)/(M\u2013ST); E, released LDH from E/T culture with antibody; s.e., spontaneous released LDH from effectors; ST, spontaneous released LDH from targets; M, the maximum released LDH from lysed targets.

Then the CDR loops-simulated 3I14 model was generated after analysing of all available antibody loop structures. The model was further superimposed to H3/39.29 complex structure before docking with RosettaDock. Only high resolution docking is performed with side chain and loop rearrangement allowed. 1000 decoys were generated for each docking and clustered based on RMSD values.
