These patients are usually on multiple medications and recently a series of discussion on how Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may be beneficial in these patients has been presented. This commentary presents a nuanced debate on why the DPP4i may not be beneficial in COVID-19 and that caution needs to be addressed in making any judgements until real world data is available.",

Furthermore, in the experimental model of human coronavirus-EMC, DPP4i did not inhibit the viral entry and viral receptor interaction was independent of peptidase activity of DPP4 [4] .

In COVID-19 infection, SARS Co-V has been shown to infect T cells through S protein-mediated membrane fusion although it's not clear whether the virus replicates inside the T cells or it leads to apoptosis [6] . Moreover, decreases in the counts of CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T, NK cells, especially CD3+T, CD8+T, and NK cell, as well as increases in the CD4/CD8 ratio in COVID-19 patients compared to recovered patients have been reported in COVID-19. Lower levels have been reported to correlate with severity of infection. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) which have a very important role in autoimmune conditions did not have a significant role in COVID -19 [7] . It is possible that the baseline suppressed T cell immunity secondary to DPP4i may be a disadvantage in COVID-19 infection and lead to a more severe disease.",

Moreover, DPP 4 inhibition by vidagliptin has been shown to reduce lung cancer growths through induction of macrophage mediated natural killer cell activity in mouse models (11) . Again, there is very sparse evidence of translation of these findings to the human lung. Conversely, according to the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, 63 cases of vildagliptin-related Interstitial pneumonitis were reported between 2009 and 2018 (12) . Several case reports have been published of vildagliptin induced interstitial pneumonia and ground glass changes in lung postulated to mimic anti TNF-alpha treatment and is postulated to be secondary to reduced TNF-alpha. In one such case, these lesions had lymphocytosis with markedly increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio which is similar to what is seen in COVID-19 infection [13] [14] . Hence, it is possible that baseline DPP-4 inhibition may increase the risk of fibrotic lesions in the lungs in COVID-19 infection wherein T cell immunity is affected.",
