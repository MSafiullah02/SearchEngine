            "text": "An epidemiological model is developed for the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South Korea -countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values. The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October 2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to 70,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.",

The WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). The COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in regions of the world that share high volumes of air traffic with China (Lau et al., 2020) . The worst affected countries are the US, Britain, Italy, France, and Spain who have reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths to date (The Economist, 2020) .

The early strict lockdown measures have been successful in stemming the spread of the disease. By 8 May 2020 the number of confirmed cases in South Africa were 8,895, a compound daily growth rate of about 5% since the start of the lockdown on 27 March 2020. In contrast, the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Italy went from a similar base of 1,128 cases on 29 February 2020 to 9,172 cases on 9 March 2020, a compound daily growth rate of about 23%.",

The first South African model (with \u03b2 = 0.748) of which the outputs are shown in Fig. 5 , seems to grossly overestimate the final number of cases. The question therefore arises: what would the predictive power of e.g. the German model have been given the same phase of disease progression than South Africa is now in? To answer this question, the data fit for Germany is repeated, but only data up to the 28th of March are used to determine the model parameters. The result is shown in Fig. 6 . The model fits the data provided quite well (MSE = 2.11 \u00d7 10 6 ; R 2 = 0.990), but because the value of \u03b2 cannot be accurately determined, the projection is that by mid-May the number of confirmed cases will be in excess of 1 million, with the peak in the confirmed cased only occurring in August 2020. In reality, the confirmed cases in Germany appear to flatten out below 20,000 with the peak having occurred in April 2020 (see Fig. 2 ). This illustrates that it is very difficult to accurately predict the transmission rate parameter (\u03b2) during the initial phase of the pandemic.",

In reality however individuals will not mix uniformly, especially if regional travel is prohibited. This means that the effective reproduction number does decrease over time in practice.

This is especially true in the South African case where COVID-19 has not progressed far enough for the confirmed infectious cases to have peaked. In order to illustrate the sensitivity of the South African model to the parameters, the base parameters are decreased by 10 % and then increased by 10 %, one at a time, and the simulation over time repeated. This is done for \u03b2 1 , \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03bb 1 , and \u03ba 1 . The results are shown in Fig. 9 -13 . Fig. 9 shows the impact that varying \u03b2 1 has on the total number of cases. It confirms that a small change in the transmission rate over the initial period when the number of cases increases exponentially has a very large effect. This also indicates that reducing the possibility of transmission early on should be effective in limiting the total number of cases.",

Mathematically this makes sense as it can be seen from equation (12) that changes in \u03b4 have similar effects as changes in \u03b2 1 as they affect the basic reproduction number in a similar way. Practically it also makes sense that the longer a person remains in the \"Infectious\" category (with the potential to infect others), without having been confirmed infectious such that they can isolate (i.e. move into the \"Quarantined\" category), the number of new cases generated will increase. This is also where testing plays an important role. The more tests that are conducted, the sooner \"Infectious\" cases will be identified. This means \u03b4 increases and the total number of cases generated decreases.",

It was found that the model fits the initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability of the model was rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model was subsequently recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values. The resulting model fit the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be reasonable. The peak number of the confirmed infectious individuals is predicted to happen at the end of October 2020, and the total number of deaths is predicted to range from about 10,000 to 70,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence of the population to these measures. The study concludes with a sensitivity analysis that show that the model is particularly sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number.",
