Several parameters can be recorded and applied for sensing including, fluorescence intensity, that can be measured at the given wavelengths of excitation and emission; decay time or emission anisotropy, which is a function of the fluorescence intensities obtained at two different polarizations, vertical and horizontal [8], [9]. Therefore, a variety of possibilities exists to improve biosensor performance. For example, the excitation or the emission wavelengths of the luminophore can be adequately tuned to improve method selectivity and, in addition, the emission kinetics as well as the anisotropy properties of the luminescent compound may add specificity to the measurement in comparison to other optical methods [10]. Recent biosensor reviews [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] confirm that fluorescence-based transduction, in whichever of its possibilities, is one of the most popular optical detection methods used in biosensing.",

The wavelength range extends from the UV to the far infrared depending on the quality of the waveguide. Higher order modes, i.e. those that propagate at angles close to the critical angle, contribute in a major extent to the power of the evanescent wave [5]. Therefore, the geometry of the sensing region must be properly designed in fluorescent biosensors based on evanescent field excitation (EFE) so as to increase the excitation power along the probe length, as well as to avoid the coupling of the emitted fluorescence into guided modes that fail to propagate in the clad fiber, what is known as V-number mismatch [5], [18], [19], [20]. Tapering of the sensing region has been proven to be a very effective way to minimize V-number mismatch and increase biosensor sensitivity when using partially clad fibers [5].",

            "text": "Several authors have studied different ways of increasing the performance of evanescent wave fiber optic biosensors. Design characteristics, taper parameters, as well as intrinsic fiber characteristics have been explored in order to increase depth and magnitude of the evanescent field [21], [22]. For optical fibers to be used in evanescence sensing, they must first be de-clad, at least partially, and most times tapered (either the core only, after de-cladding, or the complete fiber maintaining the cladding), so that they can be coated with the sensing element forming a uniform layer and thereby permitting that the evanescent field can interact with the fiber's surroundings [23], [24], [25]. All three processes (etching, tapering and coating) are not simple and require of several physical and chemical operations to be optimized [18], [23], [24], [25], [26]. One of the main advantages of EFE biosensors is the selective excitation of fluorophores attached either to the waveguide surface or within the penetration depth of the evanescent field [82]. The excitation of unbound interfering species present in bulk solution is avoided since the dp is typically in the order of 100 and 200 nm, for visible light, which allows their operation in absorbing, particulate or turbid media, as is the case in many biological samples [27]. This approach works extremely well for the detection of relatively small biomolecules (DNA, proteins) [27]; however the interrogation of micron-size objects, as cells or bacteria, require the use of sensing probes with increased penetration depth such as reverse waveguides, based on low refractive index substrates (below 1.33), or metal-clad waveguides that employ a thin metal layer between the substrate and the thicker waveguide layer to increase the probing depth [28].",

In fluorescence based biosensors, the emitted light is guided back through the same fiber, or a different one, to the detector for signal generation. In the second configuration, the biorecognition layer is immobilized onto the longitudinal surface of the optical fiber core and is excited with the evanescent wave.

Imaging fibers are high density coherent optical arrays, formed by thousands of micron-sized optical fibers, bundled in a coherent way, so that the position of each fiber in one end is identical to the other end. Thus, the light is guided through each individual fiber from one end of the bundle to the other and the fluorescence signal from each region can be spatially resolved, depending on the distance between two adjacent fibers, and detected with a CCD camera.

            "text": "Quenching, in a very simplistic manner, can be described as any bi-molecular interaction by which the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore molecule is diminished. One of the greatest difficulties of fluorometry is that it suffers from great environment-dependent quenching. Yet, what was originally considered a nuisance, if the fluorophore is the analyte, has been converted into a major application of fluorescence-based biosensors. Many are designed on the basis of the variation the quencher (in this case, the analyte or a third party related to it) produces on the fluorescence of an indicator dye. Although the many mechanisms of fluorescence quenching are beyond the scope of this paper, the process generally follows the Stern-Volmer equation [Eq. (5)] regardless the quenching mechanism [9], [41]:[5]\u03c4F0\u03c4F=IF0IF=1+KSVCQwhere I\nF\n0 and I\nF, and \u03c4\nF\n0 and \u03c4\nF are, respectively, the fluorescence intensities and the fluorescence lifetimes of the indicator dye in the absence and presence of the quencher (Q) at concentration CQ; K\nSV is the so-called Stern-Volmer quenching constant which is related to the efficiency with which Q quenches the indicator fluorescence. Eq. (5) is only valid in the case of \u201cdynamic\u201d quenching, i.e. when the fluorophore and the quenching molecules are not pre-associated before the former absorbs a photon and Fick's diffusion laws apply. If quencher and dye are pre-associated to a certain extent, instantaneous \u201cstatic\u201d quenching occurs within the fluorophore-quencher complex, and Eq. (5) is only valid for the \u03c4\nF\n0/\u03c4\nF ratio but not for the I\nF\n0/I\nF ratio because only the free quencher follows the dynamic quenching rules. If there is practically no free quencher (i.e. the association constant is high enough), the emission lifetime ratio will not change with the quencher concentration, but the intensity ratio will obey Eq. (5) with K\nSV being now the association constant (K\nas) [10]. Because the fluorophore's signal depends on the quencher concentration, Q (or the third party) can be determined by its quenching action, in a sample that contains, or to which is added, a fluorescent compound.",

Several authors have studied, explained and applied to biosensing this phenomenon, which is due to the formation of a mirror dipole on the metallic NP surface plasmon that itself radiates with high efficiency, resulting in enhanced radiative deactivation of the fluorophore excited state [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Contribution from the enhanced absorption of light by the fluorophore due to increased electric field between and around the metal NPs has to be taken into account as well. MEF has been shown to be more pronounced for larger particles, more efficient with metals possessing high free electron densities (Ag, Au) and at distances between 2 and 100 nm from the metal surface [60]. At shorter distances, fluorescence quenching due to the competing non-radiative energy or electron transfer to the metal NP surface prevails over the MEF effect [66].",

In most cases, the concentration of the target compound is related to the oxygen consumption, pH change, hydrogen peroxide or ammonia production in the course of a biocatalytic reaction that is measured with the corresponding optochemical transducer near the immobilized enzyme. Recent advances in this field include the development of miniaturized devices that are applied to in vivo analysis. For example, an optical fiber microsensor, using fluorescence lifetime measurements, has been applied to the continuous measurement of glucose in subcutaneous tissues at concentrations up to 20 mM [90]. The hybrid sensor system consists of two oxygen optodes, one of them containing immobilized GOx to monitor glucose, and the second compensating for oxygen fluctuations in the intercellular fluid as well as for slight temperature changes. In a different approach, Pospiskova et al. [91] have developed a fiber optic biosensor with incorporated magnetic microparticles for the determination of biogenic amines. The device consisted of a lens coated with a UV-cured hybrid polymer that incorporates magnetic microparticles whose cores contain an optical oxygen indicator, Ruthenium tris-(bathophenatroline) dichloride [Ru (BaPhen)3]2+ 2Cl\u2212, and their shells are modified with diamine oxidase. The measurement is performed by obtaining the quenched fluorescence lifetime of the ruthenium complex.

            "text": "Following the third sensing mechanism, Portaccio et al. [101] have characterized the intrinsic fluorescence of GOx immobilized in monolithic silica gel supports, in the UV and visible regions, using steady state and time resolved measurements, and they have further developed a fiber optic biosensor for glucose monitoring in the range from 0.2 to 10 mM. De Marcos et al. [102] have proposed a chemical modification of the enzymes using fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein derivatives, to increase the sensitivity and selectivity of direct enzyme based biosensors. GOx has been labelled with fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamidocaproic acid N-succinimidyl ester (GOx-FS) and entrapped in a polyacrylamide gel. The fluorescence intensity of GOx-FS is increased in the presence of glucose, with a linear response range between 300 and 2000 mg L\u22121 that has been attributed to an inner filter effect [8]. New trends using this approach deal with the synthesis of more sensitive devices by application of molecular genetics techniques, although their application in combination with fiber optics or planar waveguides is still limited. For example, a fluorescent molecular biosensor for the analysis of methyl parathion (MP), an organophosphate pesticide, has been described based on the construction of the fusion protein between a green fluorescent protein mutant (E2GFP) and the enzyme methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). In the presence of the pesticide, the H+ ions released during the enzymatic reaction decrease the fluorescence intensity of E2GFP. Biosensor sensitivity was greatly enhanced by the integration of the E2GFP-MPH fusion protein biosensor structure into protein nanowires through self-assembly of Sup35 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Concentrations as low as 0.26 ng mL\u22121 MP, have been detected [103].",

The sensing layers were deposited by pin-printing onto a glass-slide and evaluated using fluorescence microscopy allowing application to the determination of glutamate in water and biological samples. In a further development, the same approach has been applied to the development of an optical array biosensor for the simultaneous monitoring of glucose, urea and glutamate in serum samples [106]. Urease, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and GLDH have been coupled with the pH indicator SNARF-1-dextran and the change in the solution pH was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence ratio of the dye at 585 and 630 nm. Dynamic ranges of 2\u20133 orders of magnitude, with LODs of 3.1\u20137.8 \u03bcM, were obtained in serum samples without cross-interference from other species.

Two modes of competitive assay are widely used: in one mode, the competition for the binding sites of the immobilized antibody is carried out between the target molecule and a labelled target. In the second mode, a target derivative is immobilized and the antibody is labelled so any target molecule in the sample is able to inhibit the binding of the antibody to the immobilized target; this mode is also known as the \u201cbinding-inhibition\u201d assay; (iii) sandwich immunoassay \u2013 the preferred format for detecting targets with, at least, two epitopes in their structure. The assay involves the capture of the target molecules in solution by an immobilized primary antibody. Afterwards, a secondary labelled antibody (detection or reporter antibody) is added and binds the target molecule. Finally, the resultant complex is measured after washing the excess of immunoregeants; (iv) displacement immunoassay \u2013 in this flow assay configuration, the active sites of an immobilized antibody are previously saturated with an excess of labelled antigen. After a stable signal is achieved, the addition of the target molecule produces the displacement of the labelled antigen whose signal is proportional to the amount of target molecule added.",

In particular, microarrays which combine microsphere-technology and randomly ordered arrays have grown rapidly. For example, Nie and coworkers [124] reported a multiplexed protein microarray based on the fiber-optic bundles and microsphere-based antibody arrays for the detection of six salivary biomarkers for asthma and cystic fibrosis diagnosis. The potential to use the multiplexed protein array for respiratory disease diagnosis was fully demonstrated by the construction of an analyser, SDReader, which combines non-invasive sample collection and fully automated analysis [125]. Using the fiber-optic bundles, the Walt group has also developed a single molecule immunoarray, which they called digital ELISA [126], that can detect subfemtomolar concentrations of proteins in serum. Digital ELISA, also known as single molecule array (or SiMoA), features not only greater sensitivity but also enables faster assays, minimizes (by dilution) interferences and allows smaller sample volumes to be tested [127].",

This antibody fragment was applied in a fluorescence inhibition immunoassay on a planar waveguide detection system, where microcystin LR (MC-LR)-OVA conjugates were printed onto portable optical-planar waveguide cartridges and Streptavidin-Alexa-647\u00ae was used to detect the presence of biotinylated-anti-MC-LR.

Afterwards, the most frequent scheme of detection is based on the well characterized sandwich assay, in which a captured target sequence is allowed to hybridize with a labelled complementary target sequence (Fig. 4\nA). A second indirect transduction format for detection is the use of luminescence reporter molecules that bind target nucleic acids previously labelled (e.g. biotinylated) by PCR amplification with labelled PCR primers or by a post-amplification labeling process (Fig. 4B) [39]. In a third approach, the hybridization between the capture probe and the target sequence is queried by a fluorogenic dye whose emission is enhanced by its binding to the double strand oligonucleotide structure (Fig. 4C).",

However, several recent publications demonstrate that single core optical fibers are still the preferred platform to perform nucleic acid biosensing. For example, Massey and Krull [136] have recently explored a novel strategy for nucleic acid detection based on scaffolding duplexes bound to a silica fused optical fiber. The tandem consists of a capture DNA probe and a long-chain thiazole orange (TO) which switches on its emission when dsDNA is nearby. As a proof of concept, the biosensor was immersed in a solution containing 1 \u03bcM of the target gene sequence and a fivefold signal increment was observed. The authors claim that the suggested platform can be further used for simple nanoscale biosensors in analytical applications. In a different approach, the same group reported a multiplexed solid-phase assay for the detection of nucleic acid hybridization using optical fibers modified with QDs and co-immobilized with two different capture DNA probes. A sandwich assay is performed to detect the target gene sequence and the signal response is achieved upon hybridization through FRET-sensitized acceptor emission. To that aim, the detection probes are labelled at the 3\u2032-end with Cy3 and Rhodamine Red-X dyes which are suitable acceptors of the emission upcoming from the QD film. Although the LOD of the proposed DNA-sensor is not sensitive enough, 10 nM, this fiber biosensor opens a new insight in the development of FRET multiplexed biosensors [137].",

Remarkable is the work of Walt and co-workers based on an innovative high density fiber optic bead-array platform, which has been applied for a variety of DNA and RNA biosensors in the last five years, highlighting very low LODs as well as low non-specific binding [39]. For example, Song [139] uses this platform for the simultaneous detection of Bacillus Anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis and four more biological warfare agents (BWA) by a RNA assay where 50-mer capture probes are bound to uniquely identified microspheres. The authors reported LODs between 10 and 100 fM, and multiplexed assay with mixed samples indicated high specificity on the target detection. Gunderson and co-workers performed a DNA assay for SNPs detection using high density fiber optic array and beads decorated with highly specific ssDNA capture probes. The assay, which is based on the well-known Illumina GoldenGate Genotyping Assay [140], is able to interrogate up to 1536 SNPs per sample, minimizing time, reagent volumes, and material requirements of the process [141].",

To that aim, it is important to obtain stable DNA/DNA duplex (or DNA/RNA) structures upon hybridization [146]. Thus, synthetic nucleic acids, such as Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) (Fig. 6\nA), are being used as alternatives, for example, to the classical ssDNA-based capture probes [147], [148]. Briefly, PNAs are synthetic DNA analogs whose sugar phosphate backbone has been replaced by an uncharged N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine scaffold. The uncharged nature of PNAs is responsible for a better thermal stability of PNA-DNA [149], [150]. LNAs are tailor-made nucleotides in which the ribose moiety is locked by an extra bridge connecting the 2\u2032-oxygen and 4\u2032-carbon. The novel nucleic acid architecture enhances base stacking and backbone pre-organization. LNA was initially prepared as an ideal oligomer for recognition of RNA, but LNA also displays high affinity toward DNA single strands [146].",

The hairpin forces reporter and quencher into contact. Upon hybridization of a matching target to the loop portion, reporter and quencher are separated through conformational reorganization and the molecular beacon becomes bright (Fig. 6B). The use of MBs as immobilized capture probes on the optical substrate show two sensing schemes in which the signal is directly obtained upon both hybridization to the target sequence or ssDNA binding protein (Fig. 6B) [155]. The use of MBs has the advantage that no additional labelled species are necessary [156], [157], [158], [159]. In the last years, the employment of MBs in the development of solid-surface based biosensors has not fully matured. The results, which initially underscored the potential of MBs as smart biorecognition elements in fluorescence based FO and PWG biosensors, never overcame some of their critical limitations, such as the poor stability of the stem-and-loop structure once a MB nucleotide is immobilized onto a solid substrate. Some examples of these biosensors are depicted in Table 3.",

In the same way as immunosensors, aptasensors can be applied in several sensing schemes to transduce the recognition process, such as, direct, competitive and sandwich assay formats. There are some interesting examples of fluorescence based optical aptasensors that have been reviewed recently [160]. One example of aptasensor, combined with PWG and fluorescence detection, is the evanescent wave DNA-aptamer-based biosensor for Hg (II) detection [161]. In this work, a hybrid DNA-aptamer probe is covalently immobilized onto an optical fiber. These DNA-aptamer probes have two different parts (Fig. 7\n): (i) a short sequence in 5\u2032 for the hybridization of a complementary chain labelled with Cy5.5 and (ii) a sequence of T\u2013T mismatch pairs that, in presence of Hg (II), promotes the folding of the probe into a hairpin structure forming a T-Hg(II)-T complex. The sensing scheme is a competitive assay, between the Hg (II) of the sample and a complementary DNA fluorescently labelled with Cy5.5. This platform has a detection limit of 2.1 nM and can be regenerated with a 0.5% SDS solution (pH 1.9) more than 100 times.

Although these recognition elements seem to be smart tools for optical sensing, they have not been applied up to date in fluorescence based FO or PWG sensing. The only publication we have found is the work of Yildirim et al. [163] who developed a portable and rapid DNAzyme based sensor to monitor Pb (II). The presence of the metal produces the cleave of the DNAzyme and a fluorescent labelled fragment is released that hybridizes with the complementary strand immobilized on the optic fiber sensor surface. Fluorescent signals of the hybridized fluorescent labelled fragment allows the detection of Pb (II) in a range from 2 to 75 nM, with a detection limit of 1.03 nM (0.21 ng mL\u22121).

The three microbial species were entrapped in a silicate sol-gel membrane placed at the tip of an optical fiber to create the sensor probe that showed response to those herbicides that inhibit the photosynthesis at photosystem II (PSII). The intensification in the chlorophyll fluorescence signal was measured, and the results showed that D.c. has a lower limit of detection (3.6 \u03bcg L\u22121) than S.s.

Again, the distal end of an optical fiber is modified with a sol-gel membrane, containing the microalga, and an increase of fluorescence is observed when the pesticide inhibits the photosynthesis of PSII.

In this case, both prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells could be modified by introducing a plasmid prepared by coupling a reporter gene with a sensing element, generally formed by an operon promoter region and a regulatory gene that encodes for a regulatory protein responsible of target binding (e.g. luxCDABE operon) [171]. Upon formation, the regulatory protein-target complex binds the promoter, and triggers the expression of the reporter gene responsible for the production of a luminescent reporter protein such as bacterial and firefly luciferases. These biosensors can be applied to the detection of a broad range of analytes including metals, organic pollutants, sugars, drugs, etc. [165]. For example, Ivask et al. [172] prepared two luminescent fiber-optic biosensors for the detection of Hg and As. The biosensors consist of alginate-immobilized recombinant bacteria emitting light specifically in the presence of bioavailable Hg or As in a dose-dependent manner. The limits of quantification of the developed sensors were 0.0026 mg L\u22121 for Hg and 0.012 and 0.14 mg L\u22121 for As(III) and As(V), respectively, which are good enough to allow their use in environmental analysis.",

To overcome this shortcoming, Carrasco et al. [199] reported a fiber-optic microarray platform prepared by random self-assembly of MIP microspheres into a fiber optic microwell array. The device has been applied to the analysis of enrofloxacin (ENRO), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic in sheep blood serum samples. The sensing mechanism is based on a fluorescent competitive assay between the target antibiotic and a novel highly fluorescent labelled ENRO (Fig. 9\n). Strong fluorescence is observed in the absence of free analyte. The limit of detection was 40 nM. The selectivity of the assay was evaluated by measuring the cross-reactivity of other fluoroquinolones and non-related antibiotics. Only ciprofloxacin yielded an 8% inhibition of labelled ENRO binding at 10 \u03bcM concentration. No response was observed for the other antimicrobials tested.",
