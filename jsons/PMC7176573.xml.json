Internal reasons are closely related to the ageing of the workforce, difficult working conditions, poor lifelong learning, skill mismatches, weak career development and insufficient social recognition [6]. On the other hand, new consumer expectations are associated with changing demands for care, particularly the increasing number of old patients with chronic conditions, multimorbidity and disability [7, 8]. This new care panorama was not well enough foreseen by health services, who did not adapt their models of care delivery in time [9, 10], neglecting workforce planning and emerging technological innovations [6]. According to a recent study, 82% of burn-out among global healthcare professionals is directly related to the health system organization and infrastructure enhancements [11].",

Integrating the ageing process into any education programme would make it possible to teach genetics, nutrition, physiology, pathology amongst others, in a more dynamic and concrete way. This could also easily be linked with environmental conditions of life, philosophy, psychology, sociology, ethics and more. Accordingly, why not propose to these close, but distinct professional schools, a transversal teaching programme across the different courses? The benefits would be multiple: need for fewer teachers providing similar lectures, selection of the most expert teachers, exchanges between disciplines allowing health professionals to learn how to work together in an interdisciplinary way. Indeed, this approach would not by any means exclude the specific major training in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and others, but would create a new community of health professionals who better understand the complementary roles they play in society. Moreover, inter-professional teaching would greatly benefit from the rapid development of education technology. Initiatives such as blended teaching [15], serious games [16], virtual patients [17], virtual team play [18] and very soon, machine learning [19] will totally transform the education of health professionals. Such fundamental changes are urgently needed to attract more young and promising learners of both genders into the field of health. Too often, students hesitate to enter training as healthcare professionals because they are afraid of the reputed difficulties of acquiring great amounts of knowledge, presented in an old-fashioned way, often in a very competitive environment, and in a manner that does not correspond to their way of anticipating their future role in society.",

As mentioned above, changing working conditions require constant updating of knowledge, skills and attitudes. Continuing medical education and recertification are now theoretically obligatory, to remain working in the same position. Unfortunately, lifelong learning is not generalized among the healthcare professions, even with the increasing development of education technology such as MOOCS (massive open online courses), which normally can help to maintain or strengthen professional competences [20]. However, the career ladders proposed to healthcare workers are not attractive enough to incite them to remain working in the health services. In a survey of 703 health professionals in the United States, 35% reported that burn-out among physicians was currently a serious problem, while 28% reported that burnout among nurses also represented a serious problem in their organization [11]. Burn-out can lead to a decline in the quality of care, which negatively impacts on the health system itself in a vicious circle. Moreover, burn-out also partially explains the high rate of attrition, especially among nurses. A survey of 23,000 nurses working in medical and surgical hospital wards in ten EU countries demonstrated that 33% of nurses intended changing jobs in the next year and 9% intended to leave the profession [21]. Annual job turnover is estimated to be 6% for healthcare professionals, and up to 14% for personal service workers [22].",

Motivating healthcare professionals is a complex issue and attracting them from other countries is not a solution [24]. Often frustrated by a weak health system, poor infrastructure and living conditions in their country, health care professionals who choose to migrate to higher income countries are drawn by the promise of higher salary and better working conditions. Very often, when they arrive in a new country, their knowledge and skills need to be updated. The greatest problem with health workers migrating from poor to rich countries is the high cost for the poorest countries, who are left facing even greater shortages of health workers [24]. Retention of the healthcare workforce depends mainly on family, cultural and educational factors as well as financial rewards, career development opportunities and continuing education. In addition, the employing organization, the clinical infrastructure and the human organization of the healthcare system also need to be enhanced to be more appealing. Finally, a crucial point in avoiding a major workforce crisis is the urgent need for a profound revision of the societal perception of healthcare workers and their value [24].",
