Pediatric subspecialty teams also were available for first-line consultative questions and coordinated care with adult subspecialist colleagues if necessary. All intubations and cardiac arrests were managed by the adult critical care rapid-response team in collaboration with the pediatric critical care team, as the pediatric team often responded more quickly due to their closer proximity. Once on mechanical ventilation, patients were transferred to either the adult ICU or PICU, depending on bed availability.

In general, the unit charge nurse performed the initial screen for appropriateness of admission which included adults up 50 years of age and a limited number of comorbidities. If the patient did not meet these criteria, the attending physician did a further chart review to determine the appropriateness of admission to this unit. Because of the need for rapid transfer from the ED and the imperative to utilize all available beds to meet demand, the age and comorbidity restrictions for admissions were relaxed, particularly as the teams became more comfortable caring for adult patients. Patients were excluded from consideration for admission if the primary reason for admission was not management of COVID-19 or if they required ICU level care in the ED.",

We collaborated with our pediatric palliative care team to learn a streamlined approach to discuss advanced care directives and to use scripts to communicate about serious illness.

Pediatric nurse educators regularly reviewed Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocols and reinforced proper PPE donning and doffing.

Regardless, this report offers a description of the types of patients who can be successfully managed by pediatricians in a Children\u2019s Hospital. In addition, we report on a single children\u2019s hospital within a hospital in a large urban center. Adult-trained experts and an adult ICU were available in the same physical structure. Our results may not be generalizable to other children\u2019s hospitals. We extracted data from the EHR and chart review, and thus they are limited by the reliability and presence of documentation. Finally, we report a relatively small sample size compared with the overall burden of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "When faced with a healthcare crisis of any kind, hospitals must be ready to treat patients beyond normal capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented need to surge. Leadership at children\u2019s hospitals may decide to redeploy pediatric attending physicians, house staff, and nurses to work as individual members of teams run by adult providers. Alternatively, we describe a strategy to maintain a pediatric team structure in a children\u2019s hospital environment to care for adults with COVID-19. Our system infrastructure and staff adaptability allowed us to implement this change rapidly. We believe these results and lessons learned may be helpful to providers in other pediatric communities faced with similar surge decisions in the near or distant future.",
