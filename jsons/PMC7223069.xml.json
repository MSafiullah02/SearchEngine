The training curriculum is comprised of two pillars: (1) trauma-informed care and (2) culture-informed care. The trauma-informed pillar is based on the idea that trauma can affect entire refugee communities, and interventions must address this trauma across all types of services and care in the community. The culture-informed pillar is based on the idea that culture influences refugees\u2019 trauma experiences and help-seeking; thus, to provide appropriate mental health care, providers must apply or embed culturally-sensitive supports to their services. Together, these pillars form the cross-cultural trauma-informed approach to refugee mental health and wellness, which aims to guide stratified interventions and services for refugees and to build healing partnership among refugee-serving providers.",

            "text": "The Cross-Cultural Trauma-Informed Care (CC-TIC) training was developed based on the first author\u2019s psychoeducation manual on trauma and culturally-specific, as well as general, mental health topics in the context of refugee resettlement [22]. The training, which was delivered over two consecutive days, consists of eight 1.5-h-long sessions, followed by a one-hour reflection and discussion session. The contents involve knowledge building (e.g., mental health terms, refugee trauma and its sequelae, refugee mental health issues, and cultural expressions of distress) and skill building (e.g., psychoeducation, listening skills, systems of care and multi-tiered intervention, community-based interventions, grounding and mindfulness, and self-care). The training contents were slightly modified for each site to meet unique as well as common needs in each locality. For example, a session on integrated care was included when many healthcare providers attended, while more contents on complex trauma were added when the community recruited providers in school settings and family services. The training was delivered by the first author at five sites in two states, over a two-year period, and was hosted by national agencies responsible for state-wide refugee health promotion programs. One site offered the training twice, once in 2018 and again in 2019 with slightly different topics. Table 1 shows the comprehensive list of training topics per locality. Of note, each locality has different resettlement patterns. When providing the training, the authors aimed to focus on the major refugee ethnic and cultural groups that each site has resettled. Most of the sites have many refugee groups in common, which include Afghan, Bhutanese, Congolese and Karen/Karenni.",

Retrospective study refers to data collected about interventions or programs that happened in the past [23]. While retrospective designs may introduce bias based on participant recall [24, 25], they can allow for longer observation periods [26], greater generalizability [27], and more cost-efficient data collection [27, 28]. Studies have found that retrospective designs produce adequately valid and reliable results [29\u201331] and provide information that may be less objectively true but still important [32]. We adopted this methodology as it can allow participants to conscientiously evaluate their baseline knowledge and competencies, especially related to new subject matters, by decreasing the possibility of overestimating baseline understanding [23, 33].",

Then, we used RPPE to assess participants\u2019 knowledge and skills in refugee mental health before and after the CC-TIC training. We included seven items measuring core competencies at every site (e.g., refugee trauma and mental health and trauma-informed and culture-informed care) along with four to five additional topics that were tailored to each training site. Along with the structured RPPE items, we added four open-ended questions, related to the most helpful topical areas, remaining gaps, applicability of the training, and suggestions for future training. The study was exempted from IRB review by the authors\u2019 institution as the training evaluation was conducted by the hosting agencies for the purpose of program evaluation and no identifiable information was obtained for the assessment.",

            "text": "The aim of this study was twofold: (1) evaluation of the effectiveness of refugee mental health training for refugee service providers and (2) exploration of needs and challenges in building competencies for refugee mental health. First, the retrospective self-assessment shows how two-day intensive training can build competencies to help understand and respond to refugee mental health needs. Though mental health professionals reported significantly higher competencies in overall topics prior to the training, the reflective post-training scores showed marginal differences across professions, and non-mental health professionals attained a good level of understanding in mental health topics and foundational skills that are crucial to trauma-informed services. It is also notable that mental health providers often do not receive professional training on trauma-related topics [35, 36], let alone specifically on refugee mental health. T In fact, mental health professionals reported the low baseline scores on refugee CMDs, cultural influences on trauma and mental health outcomes, multi-tiered interventions, and trauma-informed care in this study. Although most participants (79%) reported previous mental health training, there was no significant difference in preexisting knowledge of how trauma and culture intertwine to shape mental health and refugee CMDs. The amount of previous experience (i.e., time) working with refugees also did not affect training outcomes in core competencies except for self-assessed general confidence prior to the training, which corroborated that work experiences alone do not build competencies in how to respond to refugee mental health needs. This implies significant gaps in currently-available training for refugee-serving professionals and a lack of culturally-responsive and -sensitive mental health training not only for those without mental health backgrounds but also for mental health professionals with formal training and direct practice experience.",

Knowledge and hands-on skills for refugees with mental health needs were of the highest demand, followed by resettlement-related mental health needs and cultural knowledge to provide culturally-responsive and contextually-relevant programs. Reportedly, mental health professionals showed higher competencies in overall mental health knowledge and skills and less understanding of culture-specific needs and resettlement contexts, while refugee resettlement staff and community leaders presented the opposite patterns. Though mental health professionals take a critical role in community capacity for trauma-informed care and refugee mental health services [37, 38], the findings of this study also emphasize the importance of collaborative and coordinated care. Participating in the training with a heterogeneous group provided insight into refugee mental health supports and situated individual programs in a broader system of care beyond segmented interventions, also helping to overcome pathologization of normal grieving processes and acculturation distress in the refugee community.",

This format promotes a public health approach and the principles of trauma-informed care, which underscores awareness of trauma impacts not only in the refugee community but also among caregivers and service providers and emphasizes collaborative care and partnership building across service sectors to overcome challenges in mental health stigma, cultural and linguistic barriers to services, and other psychosocial issues that obstruct mental health care (e.g., transportation, insurance and eligibility, literacy, etc.) [42]. As previous research points out [43, 44] training alone may not suffice to build collaborative care across agencies and service settings. This study shows that capacity-building efforts allow an open platform to discuss common challenges across communities of practice and to reorient gaps in knowledge and skills on an individual level to advocacy and partnership at organizational- and community-levels. Regardless of localities, participants were enthusiastic about the idea of providers\u2019 networks or partnership meetings to regularly discuss refugee mental health issues despite such challenges as lacking buy-in or internal supports from leadership, few resources for community-wide action, and limited inter-agency accountability.",

Retrospective measures were efficient in this study due to limited self-awareness on unknown topics (e.g., cultural humility); however, future research may consider adopting a conventional pre- and post-test design to assure improvement in competencies over time. Also, an in-depth study on how partnerships can be built across mental health fields and psychosocial programs would help design an effective community partnership or coalition model addressing common refugee mental health challenges beyond services working in silo.",
