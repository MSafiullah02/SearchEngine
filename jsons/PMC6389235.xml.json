Most often, the source of excretion, the route of transmission, the portal of entry and the minimum infective dose, when known, are common features to characterize transmission. However, it is increasingly evident that transmission is an extremely complex phenomenon; for example, the existence of bottlenecks during host-to-host transmission [1]. A bottleneck can be defined as a sharp reduction in size (population bottleneck) or diversity (genetic bottleneck) in a population. Focusing on pathogen transmission, the existence of such bottlenecks must be examined with consideration to the portal of entry in the recipient host and the pathogen source (blood, nasal secretion, faeces, etc.). Since a pathogen may be present in different tissues, organs, or fluids, each one might be considered a compartment with its own particularities. The pathogen population contained in the compartments where the transmission to the next host occurs is termed transmissible population; whereas the successful infectors in the recipient host are called founder variants or transmission founders. The location, size, and genetic diversity of the transmissible population can influence the founder population after a transmission event [2\u20134].",

In the case of RNA viruses, which exist as quasi-species, these different scenarios could imply very different outcomes. On the one hand, a non-directional unspecific bottleneck would produce a new quasi-species cloud from randomly selected variants. In contrast, on the other hand, a directional bottleneck would promote the expansion in the recipient host of variants derived from founders fit for transmission that are subsequently selected, since they are not necessarily the fittest, neither the most efficient for replication in the host.",

It is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the Arteriviridae family within the order Nidovirales, which exhibits one of the highest substitution rates observed [10, 11]. Experimental models to study PRRSV are well known and have been used in transmission studies [12, 13]. The immune response against PRRSV is unusual, since neutralizing antibodies appear late and cell-mediated immunity has an erratic course lasting weeks. However, after several weeks of viraemia, the virus is confined to the lymphoid tissue and eventually cleared [14, 15]. Neutralizing antibodies may protect against the homologous infection in a dose dependent way [16], although heterologous protection cannot be predicted [17]. In addition, there is a large individual variation in the immune response [18]. As a result, when a vaccinated animal is challenged with a heterologous strain, viraemia usually develops, but generally of shorter duration than in a na\u00efve animal.",

In all cases, the serum samples used were collected on the first observed day of viraemia in the recipient, usually day 2 after inoculation or contact. When transmission occurred by contact, the donors\u2019 serum of a sampling point prior to the transmission event (usually 1\u20133 days before the onset of the viraemia in the recipient) was analysed. Additionally, since samples at later viraemia stages were available, we examined the changes in the diversity throughout the viraemic period. Oral fluid samples were also available and might have been more representative than sera to characterize the transmissible quasi-species population.

Those vaccinated animals developed viraemias that were classified as long (LV > 7 days) or short (SV < 7 days). The results indicated a different distribution of the changes in nucleotide frequencies between groups along the viral genome (Figure 3). As in the first experiment, mutations were consistently reported within LV and SV groups of quasi-species. Forty-five of the 55 positions (81.8%) identified were located in the nsp9 (37 positions, 64%) and ORF2 (8 positions, 15%); while these two proteins only account for 17.8% of the nucleotide positions in the viral genome. Remarkably, in all these 55 positions, the nucleotide variants characterising the LV group coincided with the nucleotide present in the original strain causing the infection, while the SV group always showed a different nucleotide. When the nucleotide variants present in the SV and LV were translated, most variants (43) generated the same amino acid (blue dots in Figure 3), but 12 introduced amino acid changes: 2 located in nsp2, 5 in nsp9, 3 in ORF2 and 2 in ORF6 (red dots in Figure 3).\n",

However, the usefulness of NGS for viral diversity estimations depends crucially on the quality of the sample and on the procedure to prepare it [30]. In the present work we applied a tailor-made NGS method to characterize the diversity of PRRSV quasi-species without the need of primers. The method omitted the PCR amplification step and used instead a single passage in PAM when needed because of the low amount of virus present in many of the samples. By using PAM, the same cells that support viral replication in the host, a low bias was generated in a single passage, and the error rate produced was also very low. This approach could be useful for other viruses that cannot be analysed directly by NGS from biological samples because of the low titres present.",

The nature of such a bottleneck is more difficult to determine. The changes in the nucleotide diversity were not scattered randomly across the viral genome but focused in a few targets. Beforehand, one could think that the structural proteins interacting with the target cells would be the most affected ones, since they are the first interacting with the mucosa surface. Interestingly, this was the case with GP5, the viral glycoprotein establishing the first interaction with porcine sialoadhesin, one of the viral receptors on the macrophage surface [36]. The preferentially transmitted variant introduced a change in position 36 favouring an Asp, a more acidic amino acid. It is difficult to interpret this result, but it is located close to a potential glycosylation site and adjacent to the neutralization epitope in GP5 [37]. It is tempting to hypothesize a potential increased interaction between GP5 and sialoadhesin favoured by the higher polarity of the 36-Asp variant. It is also worth noting that all but one of the other favoured changes affected non-structural proteins, pointing towards the selection of variants with different replication characteristics, although the result of the precise amino acid changes could not be ascertained from the literature.",

In the present work, the duration of the viraemia was correlated with the titres of neutralizing antibodies against the virus; LV pig titres ranged between 2 and 3 log2, while the observed values for SV pigs moved between 4 and 6 log2 [10]. Therefore, beforehand, main changes were expected to be located in potential targets for the neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies for PRRSV have been reported to be induced by GP2, GP3, GP4, GP5 and M proteins [16, 38]. In the present case most of the changes in SV occurred in nsp9, followed by ORF2 that encodes GP2 (Figure 3). The 3D modelling of nsp9 (RdRp, Figure 4) showed that the introduction of a 387-Gly-His after mutations in the three nucleotides of the codon, produced a change in the folding of the protein, from linear to \u03b1-helix. This change resulted in the absence of a positively charged group opposite to the site of union of Mg2+, and would probably cause a modification in the electrostatic forces involved in the interaction with the NTP channel. It can be hypothesized that such a change would affect the efficiency of RNA synthesis; thus resulting in lower expression of the viral epitopes as a mechanism of escape. Unfortunately, with the analyses performed, this hypothesis cannot be proven.",

In the present study, for SV pigs, the mutation 10-Asp introduced a negative charge close to the residue 8-Cys that establishes a disulphide bond with the residue 50-Cys of GP5 [42]. GP5 and M form a heterodimer that interacts with heparan sulphate during PRRSV attachment; and later on, with sialoadhesin during the internalization of the virus [36, 43, 44]. The disruption of this bond correlated with the loss of viral infectivity in other members of the Arteriviridae family, such as Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus [45] and Equine arteritis virus [46]. The negative charge present in 10-Asp (SV) may interfere in the disulphide bond between GP5 and M. Therefore, potential weaker interactions with heparan-sulphate and sialoadhesin may be induced in the variants present in SV pigs. Another study showed that a single deletion adjacent to this disulphide bond produces the escape from a neutralizing antibody targeting an epitope located in GP5 [47]. It is tempting to think that this may be a similar case.",

The position 106 in PRRSV1 corresponds to 104 in PRRSV2. Fan et al. [48] showed that a substitution of 104-Gly by 104-Arg resulted in a decreased susceptibility to neutralization. Both Arg and Lys are hydrophilic amino acids of alkaline pK positively charged, while Gly is a non-charged amino acid.

The lower antibody titres in the LV group probably prevented those changes from being positively selected, and the major variants present in the initial inoculum remained the commonest. In contrast, changes in 106 of GP5 seem to be common to all analysed animals. It was proposed that T-cell responses contributed to partial levels of cross-protection in PRRSV, and therefore, the changes observed in nsp9 could be seen as escape variants [49], or as a means of escaping by producing very low levels of antigen. Potential T-cell epitopes for PRRSV have been proposed for nsp9 [50], as well as for the RdRp of other Nidovirales [51, 52]. It could be conjectured that those changes in nsp9, GP2 and M may result in less efficient viral variants for, either interaction with the cell receptor, or replication. This scenario would imply that in animals with higher levels of immunity, the variants escaping the immune system would not be fit enough to maintain a viable quasi-species cloud, and consequently, the viral population would collapse. Accordingly, nsp9, GP2 and M would be clear targets for new vaccine development. These results highlight the importance of the immune system of the host, and specifically the neutralizing antibodies, to efficiently combat and clear PRRSV infection. The role of neutralizing antibodies as a correlate of protective immunity against PRRSV is well known (reviewed in [16]).",
