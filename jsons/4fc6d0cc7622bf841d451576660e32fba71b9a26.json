As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.",

As comprehensive zinc dose findings studies may currently not be feasible but as sufficient clinical safety needs to be ensured, we recommend administering zinc in the range of the upper limit of dosing based on recommended dietary allowances [20] . So, for a male or female adult patient with normal renal function and no contraindications a parenteral daily dose of 40 mg zinc could be implemented.

Other therapies have been evaluated in human clinical trials during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2002/2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and include lopinavir and ritonavir with or without interferon beta [4]. However, it is not known whether these proposed strategies are effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients. For example, lopinavir and ritonavir already failed to show beneficial clinical effects versus standard of care in a recently published clinical study with COVID-19 patients conducted in China [10].",

To avoid interindividual differences of oral absorption rates and because of possible gastrointestinal side effects of oral zinc supplementation, it is especially for inpatients proposed to use parenteral zinc preparations which are approved and clinically already used. For outpatients at expected high risk to develop severe COVID-19, oral administration of sufficient doses of zinc should be considered. Supplementation of zinc is known to be clinically relatively safe if dosing ranges and upper limits of dosing are based on recommended dietary allowances",

Based on the evidence of therapeutic effects of CQ/HCQ, their possible pharmacological effect as zinc ionophores and possibly underestimated specific and unspecific antiviral effects of zinc, we hypothesize that the combination of CQ/HCQ with zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, in an out-or inpatients setting, may help to improve clinical outcomes and to limit the COVID-19 fatality rates [1,2]. The safety, tolerability and efficacy of a combination of CQ/HCQ with zinc, possibly in triple combination with an antibiotic like azithromycin, still represents an additional option to win todays battle against COVID-19. This hypothesis can be rapidly evaluated by amendment of a suitable WHO-supported Solidarity Trial or other studies. Important advantages of using CQ or preferably HCQ in combination with zinc are the broad availability, affordability, and demonstrated efficacy and safety in approved and clinically established indications. The European Medicines Agency recommends using CQ or HCQ only in clinical trials or emergency use programs [22]. Whether zinc supplementation in combination with CQ/HCQ should be recommended for high risk or also younger patients outside of clinical trials, as a prevention or treatment approach during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, should be currently considered only on a case-by-case basis.",
