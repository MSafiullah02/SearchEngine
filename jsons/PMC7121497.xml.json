All three pollutants are strong oxidants that can affect health directly through oxidation of lipids and proteins and indirectly through activation of intracellular oxidant pathways [23]. Strong evidence supports causal associations between these pollutants and all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular disease (including stroke), ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory tract infections, and trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers.

Radon pollution of indoor air made national news in 1984 when a worker at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania triggered the radiation monitoring system at the power plant when he arrived at work; tests revealed that the source of his exposure was not occupational, but instead the air inside his household was contaminated with radon originating from underlying geologic formations [26, 27]. This incident focused national attention not just on radon but also on other sources of indoor air pollution, including formaldehyde, mold, and, more recently, environmental tobacco smoke. In addition, recent research in the developing world has spotlighted household air pollution arising from combustion of solid fuels indoors for cooking and heating.",

Similarly, studies have found elevated risks of asthma in children and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer, and cardiovascular disease in adults among nonsmokers living with smokers [29\u201334]. Multiple studies, including several meta-analyses, have found consistent associations between visible mold in the home and the development and exacerbation of asthma in the United States and Europe [35\u201337]. A meta-analysis of studies from North America and Europe showed consistent associations between the presence of visible mold in the household and the risk of asthma and other respiratory outcomes (such as chronic coughs) in children aged 6\u201312 [36]. More than 20% of US asthma cases are attributable to mold in the home, according to one study [38].",

Estimates of deaths and DALYs from mold and formaldehyde were not included in either the global or US studies. However, burden of disease studies elsewhere indicate that these two health determinants \u2014especially mold\u2014may pose a substantial disease burden.

Chemical agents include welding fumes, chlorofluorocarbons, alcohols, and metals and their salts [46]. Prior studies have found that occupational risks for asthma are highest among those employed in mining, manufacturing, service work, agriculture, and transportation. A recent study found that workers most at risk for exposure to airborne contaminants causing new-onset asthma, when compared to exacerbation of pre-existing asthma, include nurses, cleaners, bakers, spray painters, and agricultural workers [51]. In addition to increasing the risk of asthma, exposure to occupational particulate matter can contribute to COPD, silicosis, asbestosis, and coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, the latter two of which are essentially exclusively occupational illnesses [46].",

To develop these estimates, we applied AF estimates from recent comprehensive studies in North Carolina that are based on measured concentrations of microbial and chemical contaminants in public water supplies and private wells [17\u201319]. These studies estimated that 7.3% of acute gastrointestinal illnesses and 0.30% of cancers are attributable to microbial and chemical contaminants in drinking water, respectively. We multiplied these fractions by IHME data on deaths and DALYs from AGI and all cancers in the United States in 2010, in order to estimate the US burden of disease from drinking water pollution [12]. Using this approach, we attribute 2600 deaths (0.097% of total deaths) and 66,000 DALYs (0.081% of the total) to waterborne contaminants. Among the deaths, 1900 (0.071%) are attributable to carcinogens and 710 (0.027%) to pathogens. Among DALYs, 37,000 (0.045%) are attributable to carcinogens and 29,000 (0.036%) to pathogens. By contrast, the IHME estimate attributed 300 deaths and 10,700 DALYs to unsafe drinking water in the US, considering only effects on AGI and typhoid due to lack of access to an improved water source.",

Nonetheless, until the first cases of childhood lead poisoning were documented in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, lead exposure was thought to occur only in certain high-risk occupations [73]. Recent events in Flint, Michigan, in which lead concentrations in the municipal water supply peaked due to the switch to a corrosive water that leached lead from water pipes, has refocused national attention on health risks of lead exposure [74, 75].",

Dust from lead in household paint is another major source. Lead was banned from household paint in 1978 [77], but homes built before then remain at risk. Even if covered with additional paint layers, household residents (especially children) are at risk of exposure via dust from flaking paint, for example, in window casings where friction can erode upper layers and leave a dust residue on window sills. Consumer products, such as glazed ceramics from certain countries, also can be sources of lead exposure.",

In the United States, the first documented case of childhood lead poisoning was recorded in 1914 [73]. At the time, the prevailing wisdom was that a child who survived acute poisoning would recover fully. However, in 1943, the first follow-up study of acutely lead poisoned children found that 19 of 20 subjects exhibited cognitive difficulties, including behavioral problems, learning difficulty, and failure in school many years later [73]. In the 1970s, researchers began to document cognitive effects of lead in children who had been exposed but showed no clinical signs of acute poisoning. As subsequent research has built on these findings [80\u201383], the CDC has progressively lowered its definition of elevated blood lead concentrations from 60 \u03bcg/dl in 1960 to the current 5 \u03bcg/dl. Recent research suggests that adverse impacts occur even below 5 \u03bcg/dl [73].",

In adults, lead toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, arthralgia, hypertension, severe headache, increased intracranial pressure, CNS dysfunction, anemia, and renal dysfunction.

Beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to document associations between permanent IQ loss in children and exposure to lead, even at low exposure levels [80]. Recent meta-analyses have found a loss of about 1.3 IQ points for every 5 \u03bcg/dl increase in blood lead levels in children [84]. New research shows adverse impacts on social behavior and associated increases in aggression and delinquency later in life. One study of bone lead levels in a juvenile cohort found that 11\u201338% of delinquent behavior could be attributed to early lead exposure on the basis of bone lead measurements [85]. However any child with growth failure, abdominal pain, behavior change, hyperactivity, language delay, or anemia should be tested for lead toxicity [73].",

Recent research has shown that US residents who walk to work spend an additional 19.8 min per day walking, when compared to those who drive, and bicycle commuters exercise 32 min a day (28 min due to cycling and 4 due to walking) more than automobile commuters [97].",

Similar benefits can be gained by switching from driving to using public transportation .

Multiple simulation studies have also shown substantial health benefits of reduced chronic diseases, mediated through physical activity, of compact neighborhoods with accessible public transportation, infrastructure (such as sidewalks and bikeshare programs) to support walking and cycling, and mixed land uses, in comparison to sprawling suburban neighborhoods lacking in such infrastructure [99\u2013102].",

The first stage includes several broad screening questions. The first few questions elicit information to help the physician determine whether the patient may have been exposed to pollutants at home or at work. In addition, these screening questions ask whether the patient has observed a temporal relationship between symptoms and exposures (e.g., decreased symptoms during vacations). If such relationships exist, then the suspicion that an underlying environmental risk factor may have triggered or exacerbated health symptoms increases. In addition, due to the mounting evidence of the deleterious effects of modern environments on physical activity, the screening stage includes two questions about whether and how much the patient exercises. Based on the answers to the screening questions, the physician may or may not proceed to a second, more detailed line of questioning. In this stage, the physician should ask not only about job titles or home locations but also about detailed job tasks, hobbies, and other infrequent activities that could lead to exposure. For example, there is a case of a retired executive who experienced myocardial infarction as a result of using methylene chloride to strip varnish from a wooden chest in an unvented basement; methylene chloride is rapidly metabolized to carbon monoxide, which can place substantial stress on the cardiovascular system. For patients whose health symptoms could result in part from physical inactivity, in this stage the physician can also inquire about potential opportunities to incorporate walking and cycling into the patient\u2019s daily routine.",

In some cases, such as for chronic beryllium disease, a change of jobs may be essential. Medical treatment (e.g., chelation therapy for lead exposure) is available for some environmental exposures. In other cases, a physician can refer patients to specialists in occupational medicine or other related fields. Physicians can also report suspected environmental and occupational illnesses to public health officials, trade union health specialists, and workplace managers, thus potentially leading to protections for others. In the case of exposures in the workplace, physicians can help patients to apply for workers\u2019 compensation to help cover their medical expenses.
