This is because of the adverse effects on immune functioning that fear, anxiety, and psychological distress cause (Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser 2005; Coughlin 2012 ). Positive emotions, though, have the exact opposite effect on the immune system as do fear and anxiety. Among Christians, these positive emotions are known as the \"fruit of the spirit\" (love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control; Galatians 5:22-23). Indeed, the first of these is known to cast out fear (1 John 4:18) .",

For Jews, Tehillim (Psalm) 32:11 instructs believers to \"Be glad in HaShem, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart,\" while Tehillim 91:2-3 promises protection for those who take refuge in G-d during epidemics: \"I will say of HaShem, who is my refuge and my fortress, my G-d, in whom I trust, that He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence [widespread infection].\"",

In fact, randomized controlled trials show that practice of the 7th step on the Eightfold Path, mindfulness, decreases stress levels (Hazlett-Stevens et al. 2019) . Mindfulness meditation may also be adapted for Christian elders to reduce stress and anxiety (Ford and Garzon 2017) , and similar effects may be achieved by Centering Prayer, which is very much like mindfulness (Blanton 2011) . In Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes that fixing one's mind on the Supreme God provides happiness and peace here and now (5:21;18:65).

Many priests today in Italy have likewise lost their lives caring for those infected with the coronavirus in that country.

For example, there is a Marco Polo phone app that allows recording of a video message. The recipient can watch it whenever desired (and also video record a message and send it back to the person). This app informs the individual when a message arrives by a red dot on the app and a beep. This may be especially helpful for less tech-savvy relatives who are isolated at home. If a family member does not have a cell phone, consider purchasing one and teaching the person how to use it (perhaps doing this by landline). Is it not amazing that at this time in history there is technology capable of connecting virtually everyone during this crucial period?

There are hundreds of thousands of older adults in nursing homes, and given the new ban on visitors, they too are at risk. Many nursing homes are even making residents stay in their rooms, which means no congregating with other residents for meals, socializing, or recreational activities. Once an individual (or individuals) is identified that meet this criterion, contact them and ask if they would like to have a spiritual partner during these unsettling times (many will likely say yes, often enthusiastically). Partnering means contacting them at times that are agreed on, perhaps several times per day. This time would be spent praying for and with one another, listening, and sharing God's love and hope. This will not only give a sense of meaning and purpose to those dreary endless hours spent at home, but also dispel boredom that can easily creep in when unable to get out of the house. The technology is now available to do this from the safety of home.

Staying well hydrated reduces risk of viral infection and the consequences of infection (which may often involve fever, diarrhea, nausea, etc.) (Cardemil et al. 2017) . Well hydrated means drinking a minimum of 32-64 oz twice daily. Most fluids should be consumed in morning shortly after rising and again around noontime prior to lunch. Doing so will also increase urinary output requiring several trips to the restroom, thus increasing physical activity which helps to avoid deconditioning as well (for those who cannot or will not exercise). Fluid intake after about 3:00 in the afternoon should be minimal, and no fluids should be consumed after 6:00 PM. Drinking fluids in the late afternoon or evening will otherwise disrupt sleep at night, and as noted above, sleep is essential.",

Furthermore, at least one randomized controlled trial has shown improved immune functions among those with viral infection in response to spiritual interventions (McCain et al. 2008 ).
