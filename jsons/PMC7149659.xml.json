The Picornaviridae also include the enteroviruses (polio, coxsackie, and echo viruses), which are more closely related to RVs, and the cardio- and aphtho-viruses, which do not infect the respiratory tract. Coxsackie virus A2, 10, 21, 24 and B2, 5 and echovirus type 1, 11, 19, 20, and 22 are the most frequently isolated enteroviral agents in upper respiratory tract infections. More than 100 serotypes of RVs are identified and numbered. They are divided into major (90%) and minor (10%) groups depending on their receptor; major RVs attach to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, while low-density lipoprotein receptor is the cellular receptor of minor RVs. RVs consist of a 2 MDa single-stranded positive-sense genomic RNA surrounded by a nonenveloped capsid arranged in an icosahedron, 20\u201330 nm in diameter (Figure 1\n). VP1, 2, and 3 structural proteins of the virus are highly variable surface proteins, which interact with antiviral antibodies. VP4 is confined to the interior of the capsid and is closely associated with the viral RNA.",

The A and B types are enveloped pleomorphic agents, with spherical and filamentous forms; IFV-C is structurally distinct. IFVs attach to sialic acid receptors on ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the tracheobronchial tree via their hemagglutinin (HA) protein (Figure 2\n). Following replication, the virion is released by enzymatic action of the neuraminidase (NA) surface protein. The latter, along with the HA protein of the virus, is regularly subjected to small changes, which are capable of producing viral strains causing annual epidemics. This phenomenon is called \u2018antigenic drift\u2019, while \u2018antigenic shift\u2019 is the process by which a sudden major change in the HA or NA proteins of IFV-A occurs due to genetic reassortment. The latter is responsible for influenza pandemics, which have occurred every 10\u201340 years.",

Direct detection is based on the identification of whole virus or inclusion bodies with electron or light microscopy, respectively. Viral antigens may also be detected by the use of immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays but an adequate viral load is required. Viral cultures usually demonstrate the biological effects of an agent, such as the cytopathic effect or hemagglutination, in cultured cells. Culture methods, however, have drawbacks due to their low sensitivity and extensive time length (days to weeks). Determination of specific viral antibodies in a host's blood sample and comparison between acute and convalescent phases of respiratory illness is another diagnostic modality, which is mainly used for epidemiological purposes. Serological tests include immunoassays, complement fixation, and passive agglutination assays as well as hemagglutination inhibition. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are being developed, replacing in several instances other techniques as they are rapid and sensitive, and may also provide an estimation of the number of viral copies present in a given biological sample (real-time PCR).",
