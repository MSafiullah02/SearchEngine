ABSTRACT Objectives: To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore potential factors. Results: Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21). Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 / 30 p=0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p <0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p <0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding.",

As of May 11, 2020, totally 84450 cases have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in China and 4644 deaths have been confirmed. Most patients with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms, while a small portion of them developed severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) , which usually lead to worse prognosis , Xu Xiao-Wei et al., 2020 , Yang Xiaobo et al., 2020 . It was reported that mortality of adults with COVID-19 in Wuhan was associated with older age, high sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and d-dimer more than 1 \u03bcg/L . Of interest, the mortality rate of COVID-19 outside Wuhan was much lower than that of patients in Wuhan (Tian et al., 2020 .",

There were totally 191 patients in Wuhan with median duration of viral shedding of 20 days included in that study, while 54 of them died during hospitalization. The minor difference in the duration of viral shedding between these two studies was probably based on the condition of patients, as the patients with severe type of COVID-19 only made up a minor part in the current study. However, so far there is no official definition of the prolonged duration of viral shedding in COVID-19. In this study, the cut-off value was defined as the median of the duration of viral shedding. The same method of choosing the median of viral shedding as the cut-off value could also be found in one high-quality study concerning COVID-19, in which the cut-off value was close to that in our study (Xu K. et al., 2020) .",

Although the patients with prolonged duration of viral shedding were slightly older, no significant difference was noted concerning the age between two groups with different durations of vial shedding. Advanced age was reported to be significantly associated with prolonged duration of viral RNA detection in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (Lee et al., 2009) . Recent studies about the patients with COVID-19 also suggested that older age might be a potential significant predictor for severity and mortality (Zhang et al., 2020 . Older patients were more likely to develop severe comorbidities, which usually lead to worse prognosis compared with young patients.",

            "text": "However, the percentage of patients with comorbidities and severe type of COVID-19 was relatively lower in the current study, and the effect of age on the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 still needs further study. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms of patients in the current study, which was consistent with previous studies with large sample size (Guan et al., 2020) . Of note, the highest temperature of patients was significantly associated with prolonged duration of viral shedding in this study. Body temperature is one of vital signs to assess the patient's condition. In influenza A virus infections, there was a positive correlation between the tympanic temperature and vial shedding (Lau et al., 2010) . One recent study also reported that the highest temperature at admission was the risk factor for the progression of COVID-19 . Therefore, patients with higher temperature at admission are supposed to be closely monitored and quarantined for longer time. The longest duration of viral shedding of patients in the current study J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was 47 days. The 40-year-old male who had symptoms in January 4 th and was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on RT-PCR assays in January 12 th . He was admitted to the appointed medical institution in February 14 th and was found the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA changed 6 days later. As suggested in the current study, it may take longer time for patients with prolonged duration of viral shedding to get admitted to hospital after symptoms onset. The decreased time from symptoms onset to admission allowed prompt treatment, which was probably associated with the duration of viral shedding. Of note, in the early stage of clinical work in our center, respiratory tract specimens including nasopharyngeal swab specimens, oropharyngeal swab specimens and sputum specimens of patients were obtained. For nasopharyngeal swabs, the depth of collecting specimen is the key factor while this procedure seems more acceptable with relatively low exposure risk. However, in the practical clinical work in our center, we found that collecting nasopharyngeal swabs might generate relatively high false-negative detection results. Besides, there is no firm evidence concerning the superiority of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs in COVID-19. Therefore, we mainly collected throat (oropharyngeal) swabs in subsequent clinical work.",

In recent studies concerning COVID-19 in Wuhan, the percentage of patient with antiviral treatment was much lower than that in the current study . Before COVID-19 outbroke, Changsha public health treatment center was the appointed medical institution for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therefore, antiviral treatment was more likely to be administered promptly as the routine treatment. However, it remained relatively unknown whether the antiviral treatment would shorten the duration of viral shedding as all patients treated with antiviral treatment. Besides, it was reported that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment didn't work effectively in patients with severe type in the recent study . Patients with prolonged duration of viral shedding tended to receive antibiotics, glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin in the current study. The antibiotics may cover common spectrum of pathogens but the use of glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia remained controversial (Russell et al., 2020 , Yang Xiaobo et al., 2020 . Several mild complications were observed and treated promptly. The length of hospital stays in patient with prolonged duration of viral shedding was much longer as the two continuous negative detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA over 24 hours was one of significant criteria for discharge (Lin L, 2020 , Yang Xiaobo et al., 2020 .",

The median communicable period in that study was 14 days, which was close to the median J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f duration of viral shedding in our study. The slight difference of duration may come from the different starting points in the definitions. In general, the onset of symptoms was earlier than collecting specimens of patients. Besides, the definition of the duration of viral shedding was also consistent with that in one high-quality study of COVID-19 in Hangzhou, in which the median of duration of viral shedding was also 17 days (IQR, 13-22 days) (Xu K. et al., 2020) . The study in Qingdao with 59 patients indicated that prolonged communicable period was associated with older age and There are some limitations concerning the design and data in the present study.
