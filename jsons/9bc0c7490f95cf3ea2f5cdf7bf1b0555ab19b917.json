Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.",

The most commonly used modeling approaches are different extensions of the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model formulated either as system dynamics or as agent-based simulations (e.g. for Germany [4, 5, 6] ). In many such studies, different policies are simulated and compared with respect to the goals that both the health care system is not overwhelmed such that every patient in need receives treatment and the mortality rate is kept low, and also such that the majority of people can resume social interaction as soon as possible. However, in line with [7] and others, we advocate to go from mere model predictions to (model predictive) control, since control generally offers the theory to develop and apply optimal or robust decision making under uncertainties.",

In more recent literature, multiple works have addressed the problem of open-loop optimal control for the COVID-19 pandemic. In [10, 11] , for example, the authors argue in favor of 'on and off'-policies of the social distancing measures, yielding a bang-bang like optimal control strategy. Such 'on and off'-policies, where the control input switches between two states, however, could pose great challenges, amongst others, for the society, but also for production lines, supply chains and the economy in general.",

Their main outcome of the open-loop input strategy is qualitatively similar to our results in Section 3.2: Start with a loose strategy, soon increase all distancing measures such that the health care system capacities are never extorted and then relax the social distancing measures gradually and slowly. Another example for an open-loop optimal policy applied to the COVID-19 pandemic is presented in [14] where the authors consider optimal control of the German outbreak using a slightly simpler model as the one chosen in the present paper (without distinguishing between detected and undetected individuals), which also includes an increased mortality rate if the ICU capacity is exceeded. Therein, the objective is not only to minimize the number of fatalities but also the number of susceptible individuals at the end of the time horizon, thus aiming for herd immunity. Our investigations in Section 3, however, indicate that herd immunity cannot be reached in a reasonable amount of time without overwhelming the hospital capacities. Therefore, our approach minimizes the number of fatalities after two years, with the underlying assumption that a vaccine will be available thereafter.",

By using online measurements of the current outbreak, feedback inherently introduces robustness with respect to uncertainties and disturbances to the policy. We also robustify the feedback mechanism by introducing a robust MPC-based feedback strategy for uncertain state measurements which is crucial in a situation where only a limited amount of data is available and, for example, the number of the currently infected persons can only be estimated roughly by applying different studies.",

Secondly, they state that the goal of wiping out the virus can only be a robust solution if this eradication would be a worldwide effort with very high social and economic costs (cf. our results in Section 3.1.1), which seems impossible to realize.

Our model is adapted from the SIDARTHE model proposed in [12] with the key differences that (i) we use more recent data to estimate new parameters to model the German COVID-19 outbreak (in [12] , the Italian outbreak was considered) and (ii) we model the fact that the mortality rate increases if the number of critically ill patients exceeds the capacity of the German health care system. In Section 2.1, we describe the model of [12] and explain its ingredients. Thereafter, in Section 2.2, we provide details on our parameter estimation algorithm which fits the model to the German COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, we propose an extension of the model by increasing the mortality rate when the health care system is overwhelmed in Section 2.3.",

The present model, i.e., Equations (1) as well as Figure 1 , is a mild modification of the model suggested in [12] . First, we reduce the number of parameters by including the following assumptions. We assume that the rate for developing (severe) symptoms is the same for detected and undetected cases, since (to this day) no effective medication of COVID-19 is known. More precisely, the transitions from I to A and D to R have the same dynamics with rate \u03b6, and similarly for the respective recovery rates as well as for the transitions from A to T and R to T . Moreover, we assume that the rate \u03b2 at which susceptible individuals are infected is the same from states D and R, since the state D is neglected for the parameter identification step (compare Section 2.2). Finally, as a key difference to [12] , we consider T -dependent rates \u03c4 (T ) and \u03c3(T ) for threatened patients, i.e., the mortality and recovery rates depend on the current number of threatened patients. Essentially, \u03c4 (T ) increases and \u03c3(T ) decreases if T exceeds the capacity of the German health care system (see Section 2.3 for a detailed description of this model refinement).",

Moreover, influenza symptoms usually last 4-5 days leaving us with an approximate average of p sick = 0.3% of the population showing significant influenza-like symptoms at an arbitrary time of the year.

It takes 305 days, which is almost one year, until this condition is fulfilled and clearly the economical and psychological damage caused by a lockdown period this long is excessive such that staying and waiting in lockdown is not an option. With even stricter measures, such as \u03b1 3 = 0.8\u03b1 3 , \u03b3 3 = 0.8\u03b3 3 , we could only marginally accelerate this process to 288 days while increasing social distancing is costly, cf. the cost function in Section 3.2. Note that the equilibrium attained under the above lockdown policy is an unstable one that is not robust to uncertainties. In particular, if only one person remains infected when the measures are suspended they could cause a new outbreak. Also, the virus may be reimported from other countries or humans might be reinfected by an interim host. Next, we simulate the following three scenarios in all of which the German population is kept in lockdown for a predefined period of time, followed by no measures at all. The only difference is the length of the lockdown period. In the first scenario, the measures are abolished immediately (April 21). The second one keeps the current strict measures for an additional 50 days. The third variant simulates an even longer lockdown period, ending after 150 days counting from April 21.",

We point out that due to the parametrization (6) this cost also inherently considers the infection rate \u03b3. This cost function is such that the social cost of achieving an arbitrarily small infection rate \u03b1 grows unbounded, while for large values of u incremental differences are less relevant.

The reason for this is, while the availability of a vaccine at the end of the horizon might prevent future infections, it cannot cure already infected people. Hence, if we do not account for the inevitable fatalities among the individuals infected at the end of the prediction horizon, the optimal controller does not take any efforts to keep them low and as a result a lot of people would die shortly after the two year horizon. Therefore, we propose an optimization objective that includes all past and inevitable future fatalities. Based on the model (1), we know that a total of \u03b6 \u03b6+\u03bb (I +D) of the infected people I +D will develop symptoms in the future and further that a total of \u00b5 \u00b5+\u03ba \u03b6 \u03b6+\u03bb (I + D)+ A+ R) will become threatened.

An explanation for this is that the consequences of decisions taken at later points in time mainly occur after the end of the horizon, such that a more aggressive policy towards the end is optimal, when only considering the finite two year horizon. Of course, one would not implement the \"leaving arc\" if the development of a vaccine would not be finalized after two years, since implementing such a policy may lead to an uncontrollable increase of infections towards the end of the time horizon in case that the model is inaccurate and should thus be avoided in practice.

We point out that the resulting optimal policy of slowly increasing \u03b1 is qualitatively similar to the resulting optimal policy in [14] , albeit for a different control goal. It can be seen that an initially \"stronger\" lockdown (i.e., a smaller value of \u03b1) over a longer time period with subsequent loosening leads to a better handling of the pandemic, compared to repeated tightening and loosening of distancing measures. Moreover, a smooth and monotone loosening of distancing policies is also desirable from an economic aspect since repeated lockdowns after interim-periods of relaxed distancing guidelines may be even more damaging to the economy, compared to an initially longer lockdown.",

However, since the authors in [39] do not consider the availability of a vaccine, their conclusion is keeping or even increasing the lockdown until the number of infected persons is small and all infections can be traced efficiently and effectively via strategically allocated (and increased) testing. With the assumption of a vaccine within the next two years, we argue that a slow and smooth loosening of the lockdown does not lead to many more fatalities while decreasing the social and economic cost significantly according to our model. Concurrently, increased and strategically better allocated testing, e.g., via a contact tracing mobile app [44] , is of course highly beneficial and greatly advisable to improve the performance (even if it this was not accounted for in our model).",

Hence, the policy proposed in Section 3.2 strongly relies on the accuracy of the model identified in Section 2 and thus may fail to effectively control the outbreak in case of a model mismatch. However, such a model mismatch is inevitable in practice, especially since the model itself is a simplification of a much more complex reality and the identification outlined in Section 2.2 strongly depends on the (sparse) available data and the additional prior knowledge based e.g. on further studies concerning COVID-19, which also provide only estimates.

Loosely speaking, the control goal was to achieve a minimum number of fatalities without imposing stronger social distancing measures than a simple baseline policy (compare (11d)). Since this constraint heavily depends on the model to which the baseline is applied, a realistic setting with imperfect model knowledge should allow to adapt the constraints on the policy online in case that the nominal model is overly optimistic or pessimistic. Instead of simply requiring that the cost of the MPC-based feedback cannot exceed c 1 policy , we increase the maximum cost in case that the predicted number of patients requiring intensive care lies above 90% of the maximum capacity T ICU at least once during the horizon, and we decrease it in case that the number consistently lies below 10% of T ICU . This adaption is natural, as in reality one would increase the efforts to contain the outbreak if the current measures are insufficient, and on the other hand, the population cannot be expected to accept strict measures when there are only few (severe) cases across the country. Therefore, the maximum cost in week k, denoted by c b (k), varies online with k and is initialized as c b (0) = c 1 policy . The amount by which we change c b online is \u00b1\u2206 u N \u2212k N , where \u2206 u = 1 \u03b1min \u2212 1 \u03b1max with \u03b1 min and \u03b1 max as in Section 2.2. If, for instance, the model predicts large numbers of future ICU patients, then the cost bound c b is increased by the difference between the minimum and the maximum social distancing cost, scaled by the remaining time horizon. This increase corresponds to the social cost of an additional week in full lockdown, scaled by the remaining time horizon via the factor N \u2212k N .",

This is due to the fact that the open-loop policy is only computed once, at the beginning of the time horizon, and is then applied over the whole time span of two years without any online adaption based on new measurements. Therefore, it cannot handle the model mismatch and thus has a significantly worse performance. In addition, Figure 7 shows the evolution under the proposed MPC-based feedback, which leads to a significantly lower number of fatalities compared to the open-loop policy. We point out that the feedback (partially) compensates the fact that the control action is computed based on the nominal model parameters from Section 2.2, which differ significantly from parameter set A. Due to the larger number of infected individuals, the maximum social cost c b is increased at multiple time steps, which is indicated by the step-like increases of the input. Finally, an open-loop optimal control policy is computed which is allowed to use the same amount of resources as the MPC-based feedback (in hindsight), i.e., the adapted social and economical cost c b (N ). While this policy performs better than the initial open-loop policy with fewer resources, it leads to a similar number of fatalities at the end of the horizon compared to the feedback controller. However, the number of threatened patients is very large at time k = N , which would lead to a significant increase in fatalities after the considered time period, even if a vaccine is available. Figure 7 also shows the same comparison for the model with parameter set B. In this case, since the reproduction rate is lower, the open-loop optimal policy leads to fewer fatalities than in Section 3.2. The MPC-based feedback leads to almost identical performance, but it reduces the cost budget at several time instants, i.e., it can handle the outbreak similarly well but with significantly lower social and economic costs. When restricting the budget of the open-loop optimal policy to the one of the feedback strategy, i.e., c b (N ), then it leads to a dramatic increase in fatalities.",

When comparing the result to an open-loop strategy, then the MPC-based feedback strategy can dramatically decrease the number of fatalities or the necessary amount of social distancing, respectively. Such robustness is an important property for applying any control strategy in a real-world scenario, where accurate model knowledge is rarely available. In the next section, we propose a more systematic robust MPC approach which explicitly takes model inaccuracies as well as uncertain state measurements and control inputs into account in order to safely and cautiously control the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This leads to a strong increase in social measures u at t = 140. With the robust formulation, u decreases almost monotonically. Furthermore, the nominal implementation results in twice the number of fatalities, while the applied resources c policy over the two year horizon differ by less than \u2206 u , which corresponds to one week of lockdown.

            "text": "We wish to briefly mention a stronger restriction on the societal cost of the optimal control strategy. In particular, instead of only restricting the cost over the considered horizon of N = 100 weeks, a stronger property is to ensure that at any time t, the previously accumulated policy cost is smaller than the corresponding cost of the baseline policy. This can be done by replacing condition (11d) with the following transient constraint: The corresponding results for both baselines considered in Section 3.2 can be seen in Figure B .11. In this case the number of fatalities are reduced by 33% and 37%, respectively. Thus, also for this more restrictive setting, the optimal controller can significantly reduce the number of fatalities. In addition, in the comparison to the more aggressive baseline we also see that early measures are absolutely crucial, since the two policies are essentially equivalent in the period from 110 days -150 days, i.e., including the critical time period where the ICU capacity is exceeded, but differ significantly over 30 weeks prior to the violation of the ICU capacity.

Essentially, we use the property (C.1) together with the fact that x i and the parameters are positive to ensure that (C.2)and (C.3) hold in order to derive the differential equations for the interval. More precisely, assuming that every parameter is uncertain in some bounds (e.g. \u03b2 \u2208 [\u03b2, \u03b2]) yields the following 2 \u00b7 8 ODEs:I =S(\u03b1I + \u03b2D + \u03b3A + \u03b2R) \u2212 (\u01eb + \u03b6 + \u03bb)I, (C.4c)Since these dynamics only correspond to possibly conservative overapproximations, we can use 8 i=1 x i = 1 to possibly improve the resulting bounds for S using the following projections:In principle it would also be possible to directly set S, S using the other states x i , x i instead of simulating (C.4a)-(C.4b), but this may not necessarily ensure S \u2264 1 and S \u2265 0.",
