            "text": "One of the most important challenges that limit the accuracy of POI recommendation is the data sparsity problem [1, 25, 26]. Numerous users are active on LBSNs with millions of POIs already being listed on these platforms. However, in practice, users are able to only visit a very limited number of POIs. Hence, the user-POI matrix used in different Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches becomes sparse, limiting the attainable recommendation accuracy [3, 24]. To address this problem, several studies have incorporated contextual information such as geographical and temporal influences separately into their model [7, 21, 30, 31]. For example, relevant studies have tried to incorporate geographical [9, 21, 28] and temporal influences [16, 20, 27] in their proposed model. Moreover, as argued in [9\u201311], users commonly check in to POIs around several geographical centers. While modeling these centers it is assumed that they are static and do not change according to temporal information. This assumption may not be correct and taking into account both geographical and temporal influences might help to model the users\u2019 behavior with a higher accuracy. For instance, if we consider working time and leisure time, this suggests that users tend to explore POIs around their activity centers in leisure time, while they prefer to visit the same locations more often while they are at work. For example, a person would go to the same restaurant every day to have lunch while working during the weekdays. However, the same user might decide to visit a more diverse set of POIs and visit new places while on holidays (i.e., leisure time). Therefore, the users\u2019 check-in behavior and activity centers are dependent on their temporal states (e.g., working time vs. leisure time).",

As seen, this user follows a temporal center-based check-in pattern; that is, the activity centers are different at different temporal states. Also, while we compare Fig. 1a with Figs. 1b and c, we see that the activity centers are different from each temporal state, compared to all the check-ins. Based on these observations, we conclude that joint modeling of geographical and temporal information is an effective approach for defining users\u2019 activity centers. In this paper, we take a step for joint modeling of geographical and temporal information. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\nWe propose a novel contextual model that jointly considers both geographical and temporal information.We propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers model that consider users\u2019 center-based behavior in different temporal states.We propose static and temporal MF models to study the users\u2019 preference and behavior both in static and temporal manners. In the static MF, we train the model on the whole user-POI matrix, whereas in the temporal MF, we train the model using different user-POI matrices for every time slot.We address the data sparsity problem by incorporating the proposed contextual model into the traditional MF model and propose a novel MF framework.\n",

Much work has been carried out in this area based on the core idea behind recommendation systems, assuming that users with similar behavioral histories tend to act similarly [28]. Collaborative Filtering (CF-based) recommendation approaches aim to base recommendations on the similarity between users and items [14, 16]. POI recommendation considers a large number of available POIs (items) while a single user can only visit a few of them. Hence, CF-based approaches applied to POI recommendation often suffer from the data sparsity problem. This leads to poor performance in POI recommendation. Many studies have tried to address the data sparsity problem of CF approaches incorporating additional information into the model [5, 21, 22, 28]. As the users\u2019 check-in behavior follows a spatio-temporal mobility pattern, much work has incorporated this critical information. Considering users\u2019 movement trajectories between POIs, many of the previous studies have shown that geographical influence is one of the most important factors in POI recommendation [22, 24].",

[28] argued that a user\u2019s check-in behavior is affected by the geographical influence of POIs, following the power-law distribution and proposed a unified POI recommender system incorporating spatial and social influences to address the data sparsity problem. Ference et al. [14] took into consideration several factors such as user preference, geographical proximity, and social influences for out-of-town POI recommendation. This work, however, did not take into account users\u2019 temporal information and in-town users\u2019 behavior. Cheng et al. [9, 10] modeled users\u2019 check-ins via center-based Gaussian distribution to capture users\u2019 movement patterns based on the assumption that users\u2019 movements consist of several centers. Li et al. [21], in another work, modeled the POI recommendation task as a pairwise ranking loss, where they exploited the geographical information using an extra factor matrix. Zhang et al. [31] proposed a method that considered the geographical influence on each user separately. To this end, they proposed a model based on kernel density estimation of the distance distributions between POI check-ins per user. Aliannejadi et al. [2] proposed a ranking model and predicted the appropriateness of a POI given a user\u2019s context into the ranking process. Yuan et al. [29] addressed the data sparsity problem based on the idea that users tend to rank higher those POIs that are geographically closer to their visited POIs. Guo et al. [17] proposed a location neighborhood-aware weighted matrix factorization model to exploit the location perspective that incorporates the geographical relationships among POIs. More recently, Aliannejadi et al. [6] proposed a two-phase collaborative ranking algorithm for POI recommendation that takes into account the geographical influence of POIs in the same neighborhood.",

Dacrema et al. in [12] show that even some state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods are not able to outperform a non-personalized method such as TopPopular. This is the reason why we have also selected this method as a baseline to compare with STACP. It seems that in comparison to two non-personalized baseline methods, TopPopular and PFM, our method achieves significantly better performance. Comparing with other geographical-based methods, PFMPD, PFMMGM, iGLSR, and L-WMF, it is seen that STACP followed by Rank-GeoFM perform best. One reason for the performance of Rank-GeoFM is that it considers the geographical neighborhoods as a major element in the factorization method. Also, Rank-GeoFM takes a ranking approach to modeling the interactions between users and POIs. This means that instead of considering a point-wise loss function, it applies a pairwise loss function in geographical factorization.\n",

As such, we train STACP, as well as all the baseline methods with different data sizes. To do so, for each user, we only consider a certain percentage of visited POIs in the training set randomly, ranging from 40% to 100%. We see in Figs. 2a and b the performance of STACP and all baseline models in terms of nDCG@20 for different training data sizes. The results show that STACP is more effective in comparison with the baselines as the size of the training data varies, indicating that it addresses the data sparsity problem more effectively. As we see in Fig. 2a, when we change the data size from 100% to 40% on Gowalla, the performance of STACP decreases by about 35%, while for the competitor baseline method Rank-GeoFM the value of decrease is 45%. This shows that STACP is more robust when we do not have access to enough data from users. More interesting, the performance of LMFT, a temporal-information-based competitor baseline, decreases by 65% when the size of data changes to 40%. This indicates the unsuitability of the methods that only consider the temporal information. Also, it is worth noting that we observe a more robust behavior of STACP compared to the STACP-NoCN. Thus, the proposed context model enables STACP to deal with noise and data sparsity more effectively. This is clearer when STACP outperforms the best competitor baseline (i.e., Rank-GeoFM) with a larger margin, 33%, in terms of nDCG@20 on Gowalla.",
