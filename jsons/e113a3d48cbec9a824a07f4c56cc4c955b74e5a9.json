We surveyed wealthy retail investors who are clients of Vanguard in mid-February 2020, around the all-time stock market high, and then again on March 11 and 12, after the stock market had collapsed by over 20%. The average investor turned more pessimistic about the short-run performance of both stock markets and the economy. Investors also perceived higher probability of both further extreme stock market declines and large declines in short-run real economic activity. In contrast, investors' expectations about the long run remained largely unchanged, and if anything improved. Disagreement among investors about economic and stock market outcomes also increased substantially. Our analysis is an input in both the design of the ongoing economic policy response and in further advancing economic theories.",

Understanding how beliefs vary with changes in the economic environment is central to understanding asset markets and real economic outcomes.

For example, our data is informative about models of rare aggregate disasters (Barro (2006) ; Gabaix (2012 ), Wachter (2013 ), models of disagreement between economic agents (Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) , Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008) , Simsek (2013) , Morris and Yildiz (2019) ), and more generally for behavioral finance (Thaler).

(2019) for details). We designed a novel survey, the GMSU-Vanguard survey, that elicits beliefs central to macro-finance, such as expected stock returns and expected GDP growth in both the short run and the long run. We also elicited respondents' perceived probability of economic disasters. The survey has been administered to retail clients of Vanguard every two months since February 2017. When we started the project, we had anticipated that one of the most interesting questions was how beliefs would change during an economic crisis or large stock market crash. We had therefore designed the administration of the survey to be able to launch additional surveys at short notice following such a potential stock market crash. This paper is the outcome of this preplanned contingent survey administration.",

            "text": "After one of the longest and most-pronounced stock market booms on record during 2009-2019, the U.S. stock market experienced a sudden crash starting on Monday February 24 th 2020. By March 11 th 2020, the S&P 500 index had dropped 19.2% from its previous high. On that day, the financial press announced that U.S. stock markets had entered \"bear territory\", commonly defined as a drop in value of 20% or more from the high point (see Wall Street Journal). Following these dramatic market events, we fielded an unscheduled survey on March 11 th 2020 at 6pm eastern daylight time, after the market close. The sample selection rules are described in Giglio et al. (2019) , and we encourage the reader to refer to that paper for more background information on the survey. 1 Our regular survey obtains approximately 2,000 responses per wave, with the majority of responses coming from people who have responded to multiple waves. The February wave obtained 2,390 responses. The March wave of the survey obtained 1,502 responses in the 24 hours after it was sent out to investors; 325 of those responses came from individuals who had also responded to the February wave. 2 The surveyed population is one that is relevant for understanding financial markets: retail investors with substantial investments in both equity and fixed income products. The median respondent has 225 thousand dollars invested with Vanguard, 70% in equity instruments and 15% in fixed income, and is approximately 60 years of age. At the 90 th percentile, 1 The only difference compared to regular scheduled surveys is that we did not add newly selected clients that had never been contacted before by our study. This is consistent with the focus in this article on changes in beliefs of respondents over time. 2 Response rates vary on average between 4% for newly contacted people to above 10% for those who have already responded once. Giglio et al. (2019) discuss selection bias in who answers the survey. respondents have over 1 million dollars invested at Vanguard. Giglio et al. (2019) provides more detailed summary statistics on the investor population sampled by this survey.",

In the two years before the crash, expectations about 1-year stock market returns had ranged between 3 and 6% and were at the high end of that range in February 2020. The crash brought them down to 1%. Investors who responded on March 12 th , after a further stock market drop, had on average lowered their expectation by a further 1% compared to those who responded on March 11 th . This pessimism about short-run market returns is not accompanied by pessimism about the long run. Fig. 1B shows that 10-year expected stock market returns actually increased modestly after the crash, from 6.9% per year to 7.2% per year. Fig. 1C shows that average expectations about real GDP growth over the next 3 years moved from 2.8 to 2.4%, implying a cumulative loss of GDP over the next three years of just over 1.2%. Long term 10-year growth expectations were largely unchanged, if anything increasing from 3.1% to 3.2% per year. To provide a sense of the order of magnitude of expected GDP losses, it is illustrative to compare to what actually happened during the global financial crisis. Starting at the end of June 2008, real GDP growth in the U.S. over the next three years was -0.3%, with a pronounced v-shaped pattern of growth over that period. At least for now, the investors surveyed here are not expecting on average that the COVID-19 shock will lead to a repeat of the GDP losses anywhere near those experienced during the financial crisis.",

The dashed and solid lines plot the distributions of beliefs before and after the crash, respectively. The dispersion in beliefs across individuals, i.e., the level of disagreement, increased substantially after the market crash, as visible from the widening of both densities. The cross-sectional standard deviation (across respondents) of reported 1-year expected stock returns almost doubled from 5.3% to 9.9% between the two waves. The response of disagreement is asymmetric, with pessimism --the left tail of Fig. 2A ---becoming substantially more pronounced in the investor population: the cross-sectional skewness of beliefs almost doubles from -0.32 to -0.5; the 10 th percentile moves from 2% to -15%, whereas the 90 th percentile remains essentially stable, falling to 10% from 12%. Finally, the 90 th percentile of the distribution of perceived probabilities of disaster, captured by the right tail of Fig. 2B , doubles from 10% to 20%.",

This is the crucial pattern referred to in macro-finance research as time variation in risk premia. Economic models rationalize this time variation using different mechanism. Our data supports the models of Gabaix (2012) and Wachter (2013) that after a disaster the (perceived) probability of further disasters increases, thus generating high risk premia to compensate investors for bearing this market risk. Our data also supports, at least qualitatively, the heterogenous beliefs models of Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008) and Simsek (2013) since we showed in our previous work (Giglio et al. (2019) ) that optimists in our data take more risk and therefore, much like in the models, suffer greater losses if the stock market falls. The wealth redistribution from optimists to pessimists following a market crash is precisely what generates higher risk premia in this class of models. In addition, our data shows that the beliefs of optimists and pessimists are not static, to the contrary, they have reach dynamics. These dynamics are largely absent from the current generation of models, in part we believe because of a lack of reliable empirical evidence, and our work offers novel empirical facts as an opportunity for further advancements of these theories.",

Even among investors who already expected negative returns before the crash (top row), almost half become more pessimistic. One interpretation of these results is that in February, after the spread of the Coronavirus had already started, a set of individuals (the pessimists) thought a stock market crash was likely to occur over the next year. As this scenario actually unfolded, about half of these individuals thought that the correction had gone far enough and increased their expected returns, and half expected further stock market declines. On the other hand, the vast majority of optimists revised their expectations downwards dramatically in light of the market crash. This view is also supported by Table 1B , that presents an analogous analysis for the perceived probability of a stock market disaster (in this panel, previous pessimists are in the last row). Those who ex-ante reported the highest probabilities of a large stock market decline are also those who decreased their perceived probability the most following such a decline; again, about half the pessimists become more optimistic, and half become even more pessimistic.",

First, like all survey-based studies, the presence of measurement error is a potential concern, especially for the quantitative interpretation of the results. Second, the population of investors we survey is selected both in terms of being Vanguard clients and in terms of choosing to answer the survey. Both of these concerns are extensively discussed in our previous work (Giglio et al., 2019) and here we limit our answer to pointing out that (i) Vanguard is one of the world's largest asset managers with assets of $6 trillion and serves over 10 million individua investors, thus making it per-se an interesting population to study, and (ii) while measurement error and selection are present, we have found our surveys to reveal beliefs that are reflected in investors trading decisions. A final concern, more specific to this paper, is that the COVID-19 crisis is but one shock, with its own idiosyncratic components, so that not all patterns documented might be general to other economic shocks. It suffices to say that shocks of this magnitude are so rare that much advancement in economics is achieved by their study even given the idiosyncratic limitations.",

Short-term pessimism has so far been matched with unchanged to improved long-run expectations.
