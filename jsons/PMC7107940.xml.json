This began in the Guandong province of China in November 2002 and subsequently spread to Hong Kong and, ultimately, to far reaches of the world. The etiologic pathogen was determined to be a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that presumably spread from animals that are sometimes eaten as part of exotic banquets by humans. As happens with other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV probably first mutated and then spread to new and susceptible species (e.g., humans). It is likely that spread among humans happened primarily by close contact that probably included droplet spread, direct contact, or fomite transmission. There were also several instances that may have involved small particle airborne or fecal/oral transmission. Usually, 1 case would only result in spread of the virus to a few other individuals, but there were several well-documented cases of \u201csuper transmitters,\u201d in which 1 person could infect \u2a7e10 other persons [11, 12].",

The former showed that results of virologic assessments of asymptomatic subjects were positive for 12% of children and 4% of adults for rhinovirus and enterovirus, respectively [13]. The latter study showed that only 4% of asymptomatic subjects aged \u2a7e60 years tested positive for rhinovirus or coronavirus [14].

This is true not only for ILIs and other ARTIs but also in serious cases of CAP that require admission to the hospital and in nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia that is managed in medical or surgical wards and the intensive care units in tertiary care university hospitals, despite the availability of the best equipment and access to excellent diagnostic laboratories. The article by Hamelin et al. [2] assesses 2 patient populations: patients with exacerbations of COPD aged \u2a7e40 years (with or without CAP) who sought help at one of the emergency departments at study hospitals, and patients aged \u2a7e18 years without COPD who had CAP that required admission to the hospital. Three hospitals were involved for the periods of 17 January 2002 through 6 May 2002 and 6 January 2003 through 6 May 2003.",

The symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting were seen in 17% and 10% of the children in the Vanderbilt study, respectively, whereas these symptoms were not even mentioned in the Canadian study, and although fever occurred in 5 (83.3%) of the 6 subjects in the Quebec study, it was only found in 52% of children in the Vanderbilt study.",

I would take issue with this claim, unless we interpret the statement literally (i.e., if we consider the etiology to be specifically in the early spring [all 6 cases occurred in April]). Otherwise, it is hard to imagine that 4% is a particularly significant figure. The study, however, is an important one, and it is definitely a step in the right direction. To date, we have few data on hMPV, and anything that sheds light on its role as a pathogen is welcome. What is very important is the fact that the Quebec data show that, in the elderly population\u2014particularly for persons with underlying lung disease\u2014hMPV infection can lead to severe infection that requires hospitalization (mean duration, 10 days). Hamelin and colleagues' finding that \u223c85% of the adult population in their study had preexisting hMPV antibody is consistent with the premise that hMPV infection is almost universal by the age of 5 years.",
