The differences are primarily due to amino acid differences in NPC1 protein indicating that the heterogeneity of bat NPC1 orthologs is a crucial factor affecting varied degree of susceptibility 25 .",

Amantadine would be predicted by physical and chemical properties to accumulate in the lysosomes and raise pH, interfering with cathepsin L function. The gene expression pattern reported in this paper suggests that a more general lysosomal program is down-regulated by Amantadine, likely through a common set of transcription factors. Additionally, amantadine's property to accumulate in lysosomes, if effective, could reduce viral load, decrease intra-host organ spread and decrease individual-patient, associated disease severity and progression.",

SARS-CoV-2 also has a furin-like protease cleavage site not found in SARS-CoV, between the arginine and serine at positions 685 and 686. This site may be cleaved by furin during viral egress. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might be also primed by Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)4 . Inhibition of TMPRSS2 has been shown to suppress SARS-CoV infection. High expression of TMPRSS2 correlates with SARS-CoV infection in the upper lobe of the lung 10 . Interfering with the spike protein processing by the host cell, whether by affecting the environment or modulating gene expression levels, hence offers a potential therapeutic strategy. Genetic variation in CTSL gene could in theory affect the propagation capacity of the virus. Furthermore CTSL polymorphisms could affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 where for example individuals with certain genetic variant have reduced expression of Cathepsin L and in turn could be protected or have lower viral titers. Additionally, elements of hosts major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) and cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL) mediated immune responses might affect viral proliferation 11 . There are susceptibility factors spanning from ethnicity background to age related groups, to comorbid conditions 12 .Novel therapeutics identified by high throughput screening assay, shown to block the cleavage of CoV2 S (Spike) protein by Cathepsin L,Cathepsin B or TMPRSS2 (or any other protease) at predicted/selected binding sites, will be a viable approach to functionally target and limit SARS-CoV-2 virus. Other therapeutic mechanisms of action could involve lowering or modulating the expression of CTSL or affecting the conditions of the CTSL lysosomal environment by modulating pH. Here we tested compounds that could help identify potential therapeutic agents with the capacity to decrease expression or inhibit the expression of the CTSL gene. We identify Amantadine among top significant compounds. Further clinical studies should be conducted to examine whether amantadine could be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 infection.",

The PK profile of the drug makes it particularly suitable for administration to humans. Plasma concentration is in the range of 200-800ng/mL depending on the formulation and dosing regimen.

Amantadine HCl immediate release is available as a 100-mg tablet and 50 mg/5 mL syrup and is typically administered twice daily18 .

We investigated natural variation of CTSL expression across ethnicities, focusing on common and rare variants. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 5 provides genotype information and gene expression levels across 49 human tissues from 838 donors, allowing us to examine the expression patterns of CTSL, both across tissues as well as across individuals.Figure 2 shows expression of CTSL across different organs and associated cell types. CTSL is widely expressed in many crucial organs (increase expression in: lungs, in nerve-tibial, adipose, artery, whole blood and fibroblasts). Looking at expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in CTSL, we have found a very significant and lung specific (rs2378757) variant conferring highly variable expression. The genotype (Supplementary Figure 1a) confers lower baseline expression and is likely associated with a better response and conversely higher expression perhaps higher viral load. In addition, there are several splice quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) (hence variants affecting splicing ratios of transcripts) such as rs114063116 significant and present in the lungs tissue.CTSL genotype-tissue analysis points to potential variants that may constitute susceptibility or resilience to infection of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals. Interestingly, the alternative splicing of the CTSL transcript in the lung further displays tissue specific regulatory programs (Supplementary Figure 1b). A recent functional study points to a common variant in CTSL in the proximal CTSL1 promoter, (position C-171A), confirmed to alter transcription via alteration of the xenobiotic response element 20 . This and similar other variants likely affect natural diversity in baseline expression hence viral fitness at cell entry of SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, we checked in the gnomAD 21 database the number of rare variants and variation tolerance status of CTSL. The results show that there are on average 167 missense variants in CTSL and the gene is predicted to be loss-of-function variant tolerant with a pLI of 0.01. Together with significant eQTLs this indicates large effect of genetic variation on CTSL expression. TMPRSS2 is also widely expressed in multiple tissues including those in the GI system, lung, and kidney 5 . The high expression of CTSL and TRMPSS2 transcripts in a series of organs could explain the viral manifestation in these tissues such as recent studies showing viral presence in stool samples from infected individuals as well as effects of the virus seen across multiple tissues 22 .",

The retinal pigment epithelia cell line, ARPE-19/HPV-16, was chosen to establish a database of drug profiles because of its non-cancerous, human origin, with a normal karyotype. It can also be easily grown as monolayer in 96-well plates. Compounds were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Washington, DC). Cells were aliquoted on 96-well plates (~2\u00d710e5 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h prior to providing fresh media with a drug, or the drug vehicle (water, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, methanol, or phosphate-buffered saline solution). Drugs were diluted 1000 fold in buffered in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (D-MEM/F-12) culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing nonessential amino acids and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate. In these conditions, no significant changes of pH were expected, which was confirmed by the monitoring of the pH indicator present in the medium. A final 10 \u03bcM drug concentration was chosen because it is believed to fit in the range of physiological conditions 26 . Microscopic inspection of each well was conducted at the end of the treatment to discard any samples where cells had morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. We also verified that the drug had not precipitated in the culture medium. Gene expression Cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy 96 protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression for 22,238 probe sets of 12,490 genes was generated with U133A2.0 microarrays following the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Drugs were profiled in duplicate or triplicate, with multiple vehicle controls on each plate. A total of 708 microarrays were analyzed including 74 for the 18 antipsychotics, 499 for the other 448 compounds, and 135 for vehicle controls. The raw scan data were first converted to average difference values using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The average difference values of both treatment and control data were set to a minimum of 50 or lower. For each treatment category, all probe sets were then ranked based on their amplitude, or level of expression relative to the vehicle control (or the average of controls was selected when more than one was used). Amplitude was defined as the ratio of expression (t\u2212v) / [(t+v) / 2] where t corresponds to treatment instance and v to vehicle instance. Each drug group profile was created using our novel Weighted Influence Model, Rank of Ranks (WIMRR) method which underscores the rank of each probe set across the entire gene expression profile rather than the specific change in expression level. WIMRR takes the average rank of each probe set across all of the members of the group and then reranks the probe sets from smallest average rank to largest average rank. A gene-set enrichment metric based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. Specifically, for a given set of probes, the KS score gives a measure of how up (positive) or down (negative) the set of probes occurs within the profile of another treatment instance. 26.

Given that amantadine does not only down-regulate CTSL expression, but a number of key lysosomal enzymes, we can now hypothesize that lysosomal dysfunction induced by amantadine administration can be protective against viral entry and ultimately replication. Our hypothesisis that people with certain lysosomal storage diseases are resistant to one of these viruses. Along these lines there is suggestive evidence for this to be true. For example Niemann-Pick disease type C1 lipid storage disorder offers resistance to Ebola in patient cell lines23 , 24  . Interestingly, bat species show selective sensitivity to Ebola versus Marburg viruses",
