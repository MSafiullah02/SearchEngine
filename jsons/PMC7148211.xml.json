Its main assumption is that users do not simply ask a question to a knowledge base and then quit. Instead, users tend to break down complex questions into a series of simple questions [5]. In addition, as known from exploratory search [12], users who do not have a very clearly articulated information need and/or who aim at getting familiar with a new field of knowledge tend to ask series of questions where one answer triggers the next question. That is, a user might ask a rather \u201cfuzzy\u201d first question (such as \u201cwhat are important topics in the field of \u2018Information Retrieval\u2019?\u201d) and then \u2013 when studying the answer \u2013 start to think of new questions, concerning some of the new concepts found in that answer. Although the concept of exploratory search is well known from the field of information retrieval, this exploratory motivation for performing sequential question answering (over structured knowledge bases) has not been studied so far. In any case, sequential question answering raises the major challenge of keeping track of context: since they assume the context to be known from the prior questions and answers, users tend to leave away sentence elements [14].",

It supports both the user and the system in keeping track of the context/current focus of the search via a novel interaction concept that combines pointing/clicking and asking questions in natural language, described in Sect. 3.2.",

The iPEGMA data covers mostly German books while DBPedia data is focused on English books.In terms of semi-structured data, our HTML parser can process web content and a special Twitter parser deals with Tweets (and uses the HTML parser to process web pages linked from tweets). We applied the HTML parser to the websites literaturkritik.de and www.complete-review.com to retrieve book reviews and related book metadata in German and English. The Twitter parser was applied to a collection of Twitter accounts of major publishers whose timelines were analysed for tweets referring to books.We also integrated a sentiment analysis service (Aylien Text API5) as a typical example of analysis of the unstructured part of webpages, i.e. the plain text. In our case, we applied the service to the book reviews from literaturkritik.de to find out whether reviews were positive or negative.

We used this property heavily: each parser has a configuration file in which one can define node and relation types to be extracted. We have developed a special syntax with which one can define the patterns to be searched within the various data sources to retrieve the corresponding data. This means that parsers can be extended to find new types of nodes and relationships and/or cover new data sources of known type, without the need to modify the program code of the parser. Typically, the specifications for various data sources have overlapping node types, thus resulting in a data integration task. In order to match identical nodes (e.g. the same book) found in different data sources, the definitions also specify a \u201cuniquneness attribute\u201d (similar to a primary key in relational databases).

Having to explicitly select context is hard to get used to for some, and should be automated. The visual representation of results was well received for its support of understanding relationships. On the other hand, it became clear that ranking or highlighting the more \u201crelevant\u201d nodes will be needed to help users focus, especially when results get larger.",

Because of the limitations of our participant selection strategy, further test with a more varied user group will also be required. Finally, it might be interesting to explore the possibility for users to combine search results (sub-graphs) of queries before exploring the combined results further.",
