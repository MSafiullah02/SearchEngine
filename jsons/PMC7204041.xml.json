These improvements have been related to the introduction of \u201clung-protective ventilation,\u201d delayed surgery, and an increased focus on targeting pulmonary hypertension and circulatory stabilisation issues [6]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a well-established treatment modality for neonates with reversible circulatory or respiratory failure, with a well-documented impact on survival [7]. Many ECMO-centres offer treatment to CDH-infants, when conventional treatments fail. However, despite improved technology, ECMO treatment is associated with severe complications [8] and evidence of causal effect on long term survival in CDH-populations is lacking [9, 10].",

Infants diagnosed postnatally at other hospitals were transported to our institution for further treatment. The management of CDH-infants at our hospital, initially implemented in 1997, included a strategy of early intubation and gentle ventilation. All infants needing mechanical ventilation were started on high-frequency oscillatory (HFO) ventilation (SensorMedics 3100A/B HFO Ventilator, Viasys Healthcare, USA). Further ventilation strategies and weaning were tailored to the individual clinical situation, and could also include conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or supplementary oxygen. All infants were sedated initially using continuous intravenous infusion or refractory morphine, fentanyl, and midazolam doses. Methadone, phenobarbital, and clonidine were preferred for weaning and the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Infants were monitored by pre- and post-ductal saturation, continuous invasive measurements of blood pressure via an arterial line \u2013 umbilical preferred, and central venous access was also established. Our protocol also included the aggressive treatment of acidosis using sodium-bicarbonate. The target value for post-ductal saturation was > 95%. In severe cases with pulmonary hypertension, treatment with iNO (inhaled Nitric Oxide) was initiated by the intensivist in charge, and adequate circulation and perfusion were maintained with appropriate inotropes/vasopressors. Echocardiography and a plain chest x-ray were performed within the first 24 h of admission to PICU, and later when necessary.",

Enteral feeds were commenced from day one, and gradually increased up to the calculated basic need if tolerated by the infant. Parenteral nutrients were only supplied when enteral feeding was not adequate, after approximately 1 week. In all cases, surgery was performed using open abdominal access, and for large defects, a patch was inserted. The routine use of a chest tube after surgery was not practiced. Pleurocentesis was performed when a mediastinal shift (compromising respiratory or circulatory function) was observed due to excess filling of the intrapleural space with replacement fluid after surgery. The procedure was guided by chest x-ray, and in some cases ultrasound, to minimise the risk of further complications.",

Sildenafil was continued after discharge and the paediatric cardiologist team conducted weaning of the drug thereafter. Adequate circulation/perfusion was maintained using inotrope/vasopressor therapy. Dopamine and nor-epinephrine were first-line choices, but during the study period, dobutamine was more often replaced by milrinone, as a second-line treatment in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Thus, centres without access to ECMO, also report increased survival rates correlating with the introduction of multidisciplinary and more aggressive multimodal treatment approaches. As described at our hospital, organisational and management changes resulted in significant improvements in outcomes for our CDH population, reducing mortality from 67 to 23% [25]. Other centres have reported mortality rates between 13 and 34% [26\u201328]. In recently published guidelines, the CDH-EURO consortium (2015) stated that the benefits of ECMO for CDH treatment remained unclear, and provided grade D recommendations for initiating treatment. However, the following criteria were stated: preductal saturation < 85% or postductal saturation < 70%, respiratory acidosis with a pH < 7.15, peak inspiratory pressure > 28 cm H2O, or mean airway pressure > 17 cm H2O, metabolic acidosis with lactate \u22655 mmol/l and pH < 7.15, shock refractory to treatment and with urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for at least 12\u201324 h, and oxygenation index (OI) \u2265 40 present for at least three hours [29].

Magnetic resonance imaging is also used to prenatally evaluate the degree of lung hypoplasia, however, this modality has only recently been taken up at our institution and was therefore not evaluated here [32]. Unfortunately, data for \u201cliver-up\u201d, lung-to-head ratio, and other possible risk factors were not registered in a consistent and structured manner throughout the study period. Likewise, ventilator associated parameters such as pCO2 and oxygenation index (OI) were not retrievable in a consistent manner, but would have added valuable information to the study as possible indicators of severity.",
