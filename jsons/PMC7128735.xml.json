The red star represents Beijing, gold diamond represents Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of nCoV, and Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Chongqing are indicated by the green circles. The blue curves are the Yellow river (upper) and Yangtze river (lower). Panel (B) shows the daily number of passengers by train versus the total number of imported nCoV cases in each city. The observed data are in blue, the fitted regression model is the red line, and the 95%CI is shown as the red dashed line.
