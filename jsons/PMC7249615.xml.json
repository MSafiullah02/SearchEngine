According to the WHO, as of April 18, 2020, coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases globally, and close to 150,000 deaths [2]. As the world witnesses the alarming levels of spread and severity of atypical pneumonia COVID-19, strategies to combat this outbreak are in dire need. The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak is already starting to come to fruition, having devastating effects on human lives, globally impacting health systems and economies. The flourishing COVID-19 outbreak is reminiscent of epidemics that have caused panic in recent memory. These include SARS, MERS, the Zika virus, swine flu, and Ebola. This is the third documented coronavirus (CoV) transmission from animals to humans (zoonosis) in 2 decades. Previous outbreaks were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3, 4] and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5]. We are now dealing with the novel CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), originally termed 2019-nCoV, and now designated SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7].",

They confirmed that the S protein on SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of its close relative, SARS-CoV, with sequence identity of 76% for this protein between the two origins [12]. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is known as a class I fusion protein. It is a large transmembrane protein of approximately 150 kDa and is highly glycosylated. S glycoproteins assemble into trimers on the virion surface (Fig. 1). The S protein consists of two subunits: the S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S1 subunit mediates attachment of the virion to host cell surface receptors and rests above the other subunit, the C-Terminal S2, containing conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP), responsible for fusion of viral and cellular membranes [10] (Fig. 2). The S2 subunit mediates subsequent fusion between viral and host cellular membranes, facilitating entry into the host cell [13]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to bind human cells more tightly than the SARS virus, which may explain why COVID-19 appears to spread more easily, mainly by respiratory transmission, from person to person.",

            "text": "An important question is why the lungs seem to be the most vulnerable target organ. One possible reason could be due to the large alveolar epithelial surface of the lungs being incredibly susceptible to inhaled noxious agents and pathogens such as viruses. Another reason could be that the lungs and especially the alveolar epithelium have a high density of cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as the receptor-binding domain for its S protein [14, 15]. Zhao and colleagues describe that approximately 85% of ACE2-expressing cells are epithelial type II alveolar cells (AECII, or AT2). This particularly suggests that these cells are a preference for viral invasion. In addition, genetic analysis indicates that ACE2-expressing AECII have a high level of multiple proviral genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life cycle, viral reproduction, and genome replication [16].",

            "text": "This infers that ACE2-expressing AECII cells favor the replication of the CoVs in the lungs and are, therefore, essentially responsible for pulmonary complications. The expression of the ACE2 receptor was also found in many extrapulmonary tissues including pharynx, heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestine [17, 18]. Theoretically, there could be viral invasion and replication in any of these tissues. However, currently, it appears that almost all of the fulminant trends of the virus are primarily pulmonary [16]. This organ seems to be the main replication and distribution center for the CoVs. A potential treatment should, therefore, first target the lungs to prevent a generalized infection or at least mitigate the symptoms. ACE2 is also strongly expressed and used on the lumen surface of intestinal epithelial cells as a co-receptor for the absorption of nutrients, especially for amino acids from ingested food [19]. It can be assumed that the intestine could also be an important entry point for SARS-CoV-2 and that the first infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have resulted from eating food from the seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, the suspected site of the outbreak [7]. If SARS-CoV-2 does infect the human intestinal epithelium, it has important effects on the fecal\u2013oral route of transmission, the containment of the virus spread, and treatment for it [20]. The distribution of ACE2 tissue in other organs other than the lungs could also explain expansion of dysfunction observed in patients.",

Cleavage or priming of the S protein by TMPRSS2 is essential for the fusion of the virus with the ACE2 receptor needed for viral entry and spread of SARS-CoV-2 [25]. Hoffmann et al. [26] confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells mainly via binding and fusion with ACE2. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity is thus an excellent target for antiviral intervention. TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in modulating the metastatic behavior of certain tumors, e.g., in prostate cancer and in modulating inflammation of organs, such as in the context of pancreatitis. Hoffman et al. [26] suggested that TMPRSS2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19, since entry of the virus into cells was reduced by camostat mesilate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor. It is currently only approved for treatment of chronic pancreatitis in Japan [27]. Very little data are available on the drug\u2019s risk profile with little or no experience with use in children, pregnant women, multimorbid patients, and other high-risk patients. It is a non-selective TMPRSS2 inhibitor, which means that it has greater, more severe side effects than a selective TMPRSS2. Camostat mesilate is currently undergoing Phase 1/2 trial testing in the USA for chronic pancreatitis [28]. If deemed safe, it could be a potential treatment option of CoV infections [29]. Nafamostat mesilate is also a serine protease inhibitor widely used as an anticoagulant and used to treat pancreatic and kidney disease. It is structurally closely related to camostat mesilate. Researchers previously identified nafamostat mesilate\u2019s potential to inhibit MERS-CoV [30]. Risks of complications (including anaphylaxis) must be considered in non-emergency care.",

Bromhexine is orally readily bioavailable. Endonasal application is also a good alternative option. Bromhexine is an over-the-counter (OTC) drug [32] that is affordable with proven safety.

Chloroquine (N4-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine), an FDA-approved drug, [36] has been used to treat malaria for many years, [37] as well as autoimmune diseases. Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/endosome fusion [38] and release of viral DNA or RNA into the cytosol. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [39], which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. It also works as a novel class of autophagy inhibitor, [40] further interfering with viral infection and replication. A combination of remdesivir and chloroquine was proven to effectively inhibit the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [41]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found to be efficient against SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COVID-19 patients [42]. Chloroquine is easily available and relatively low in cost. Therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against COVID-19. However, an overdose of chloroquine can cause acute poisoning and death [43]. HCQ sulfate, a derivative of chloroquine, demonstrated much less (~ 40%) toxicity than chloroquine in animals [44] and is a good alternative. As of March 2020, seven clinical trial registries were found using HCQ sulfate in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn) and three were found using HCQ sulfate in ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) to treat COVID-19.",

In so doing, it not only neutralizes the virus, but also saves the cellular ACE2 activity that regulates the renin angiotensin system (RAS) [47], additionally protecting the lungs from injuries. Therefore, treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 could slow down and/or even prevent virus entry into cells and reduce virus spread, and also protect the lungs from injury.

Once the virus is internalized, only then does the fusion of virus with lysosomes depend on a low endosomal and lysosomal pH [49]. Following this, the S glycoprotein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by endosomal proteases cathepsin B/L, with the resulting S2 subunit-mediating membrane fusion [50]. To date, numerous protein inhibitors of cathepsin B/L have been described, some of which are of endogenous origin and led to the design and development of several specific peptide- and peptidomimetic inhibitor drugs. One such drug, named E-64d, an epoxysuccinyl cathepsin inhibitor blocked SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into the TMPRSS2- (knockout) cell lines 293T and Vero [26]. However, even if E-64d and analogs are therapeutically effective from a drug perspective, they are not widely accepted or approved. In addition, some exogenous protein inhibitors of cathepsin B/L have been isolated from various natural sources. Amongst such inhibitors are aziridines like miraziridine and aldehydes like tokaramide but also other non-peptidic natural compounds such as flavonoids. Quercetin is a strong cathepsin inhibitor with an IC50 in the low micromolar range [51]. Quercetin is a common and readily available supplement and, therefore, must be considered as an adjuvant to prevent or to weaken the course of such viral infections. Cathepsin B/L activity is inhibited by an elevated endosomal pH and, thus, chloroquine treatment will also work [52].",

They cleave two translated polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) into individual functional components. These proteases are considered promising drug targets, particularly 3CLpro, as all residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding, and dimerization are 100% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [58].",

Bromhexine hydrochloride acts as a mucolytic (breaks down mucus and helps clear chest congestion) and is approved in many countries as an OTC drug. It is characterized by low side effects and a low purchase price. Bromhexine is structurally related to ambroxol, an active demethylated metabolite of bromhexine, that is also a known medicine in the market. The available data suggest further that ambroxol is a potent inducer of surfactant synthesis in AT2 cells [63\u201365]. Its lung protective properties have been discussed in infants and severely ill adult patients as well as the potential as an adjuvant in anti-infective therapy [64]. Thus, bromhexine also provides indirect protective effects. Bromhexine hydrochloride is sold under a few brand names, such as, Bisolvon\u00ae, Broncholyte Elixir, Paxirasol, and Bisolex amongst others. According to the package inserts (information for use), the medicinal products containing bromhexine hydrochloride are usually administered three times a day (8\u201316 mg per dose for adults). It shows a quick and almost complete absorption in the intestine. Lung-tissue concentrations 2 h post dose are 1.5\u20134.5 times higher in bronchiolo-bronchial tissues and between 2.4 and 5.9 times higher in pulmonary parenchyma compared to plasma concentrations. Unchanged bromhexine is bound to plasma proteins by 95% [66, 67].",

[31], as mentioned above, showed a decrease in the frequency of metastases and a slowdown of the spread of metastases in mice with prostate cancer using TMPRSS2 inhibitors. The extent of metastasis reduction with bromhexine was slightly lower in the wild-type mice than in the genetic TMPRSS2\u2212 mice. This is most likely due to an incomplete pharmacological blockage of the protease activity by the applied bromhexine, presumably due to the dosage and the long dosage intervals in the study (72 h) [31]. The terminal half-life of bromhexine in an oral application of 8 mg per single dose is an average of 6.6 h [67]. Bromhexine is orally readily bioavailable, and thus, a more frequent and higher oral dose could have a stronger and longer term inactivation of the TMPRSS2 enzyme. Endonasal, sublingual, buccal application, or inhalation might also be good alternatives as this could circumvent the first pass effect. Laporte and Naesens [68] reported that bromhexine did not show any significant cell entry or replication inhibition effect in vitro in influenza viruses. However, the authors showed that influenza viruses utilize, contrary to SARS-CoV-2, a different extracellular host protease for priming. Thus, these results are not representative for SARS-CoV-2 [68].",

Treatment with BHT alleviated lung injury to a certain extent, as we have proposed, and no severe adverse effects were experienced. The experimental group compared to the control group required less oxygen inhalation days (2 days on average for the experimental group and 4 days on average for the control group), had lower proportion of patients requiring oxygen inhalation (16.67% for the experimental group and 33.33% for the control group), and had smaller incidence of adverse events of liver injury which is expected (25% for the experimental group and 66.67% for the control group). Bromhexine and ambroxol appear to have a liver protective effect. Comparatively, liver toxicity when given chloroquine/HCQ and liver damage in COVID-19 is a high risk.

After the viral infection has spread in the body and due to the incredibly high viral loads, the non-specific endocytotic pathway is mainly used for further virus replication. This may explain the recent success reported with chloroquine to assist in the curing of the virus. In already infected individuals, we believe that it is essential to combine HCQ with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, like bromhexine, to block complete entry of the virus into host cells. In the case of prophylaxis, the inhibition of the TMPRSS2 is essential [26] and the non-specific endosomal entry is negligible. An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, e.g., bromhexine or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor, e.g., a peptide inhibitor. This will prevent further spreading of the virus through the host\u2019s body. Furthermore, a combination with the lesser toxic chloroquine derivate, HCQ sulfate, that is (amongst other functions) an effective endosomal protease inhibitor, inhibiting cathepsin B/L, could be a favorable combination for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of the 3CLpro inhibitor, quercetin, is also a favorable addition. This combination would block virus-host cell entry completely by blocking the specific receptor-mediated entry (via bromhexine) and non-specific endocytotic virus entry (via HCQ sulfate and quercetin) as well as viral replication (quercetin).",

            "text": "The recommended dose of HCQ sulfate for prophylaxis is 400 mg per week and for a curative treatment a loading dose of 800 mg (twice daily 400 mg) for the first day and 400 mg (twice daily 200 mg) for the following 4 days [78]. The toxic dosage range of chloroquine and HCQ is close to the therapeutic range [79]. Especially, since chloroquine derivatives are quite toxic, a combination with bromhexine and a lower dose of HCQ could be applicable. A combination of airway protease inhibitors with other antiviral drugs is known to obtain a synergistic effect or reduce the risk of resistance. An example shows that a combination of oseltamivir with the serine protease inhibitor BAPA (benzylsulfonyl-d-Arg-Pro-4-amidino-benzylamide) is able to suppress influenza virus replication in human airway epithelial cells at remarkably lower concentrations compared to a treatment with each inhibitor alone [80]. One can deduce that the same could be applicable for the herein proposed drug application. Bromhexine would be a valuable addition in combination with antivirals such as remdesivir. The beneficial role of flavonoid supplements like quercetin to contribute to an inhibition of the viral entry and replication must also be considered as additional support to current and also our proposed treatment scheme [51] (Fig. 3)",

It appears the fight against COVID-19 is just beginning. Globally, the economic cost of the pandemic has been estimated at $1 trillion in 2020 (UN\u2019s trade and development agency, UNCTAD). There is, at the time of this writing, still no sign of the COVID-19 pandemic slowing down, and with over 2,000,000 recorded infections, it is time to take unprecedented global actions [2]. It is still in the early stages of the outbreak and we have limited knowledge about the transmission and mutation rate of this virus. As the virus continues to spread to more individuals, more mutations may arise which can potentially make the virus even more virulent and difficult to eradicate. As specific functions of the viral proteins and the pathogenicity of the virus become clearer and the sharing of information on variants and clinical information becomes more accessible, we can plan that therapeutic treatments are near in our future.",

A fast and immediate prophylactic option to prevent or potent drug to treat the disease progression in these urgent times is the repurposing of an already existing approved drug to be used for off-label usage. Bromhexine or preferably in combination with HCQ could be such an ideal candidate or candidate combination. A further combination with quercetin could be beneficial, as well. First, the combination could be utilized for prophylactic applications, specifically for the more vulnerable individuals such as the elderly, diabetics, those with coronary diseases, and immune-compromised individuals. Here, quercetin could possibly replace HCQ. Second, this combination can be used to lower the viral burden in newly infected individuals, limiting their capacity to transfer the virus and in so doing also prevent them from developing a severe or even critical manifestation of the disease. We encourage the scientific community to test bromhexine and the suggested combinations and to follow our recommended approach to also identify further ideal repurposing candidates according to the herein proposed criteria.",

SARS-CoV-2 employs two routes for host cell entry, which are dependent on the localization of the proteases required for activation of the S protein. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cellular receptor, ACE2, can result in uptake of virions into endosomes, where the S protein is activated by the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin B/L. Activation of the S protein by cathepsin B/L can be blocked by HCQ and quercetin. Alternatively, the S protein can be activated by TMPRSS2, resulting in fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane. Activation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 can be blocked by bromhexine. Quercetin also blocks viral replication via inhibition of the viral cysteine protease 3CLpro. ( Adapted from Simmons et al. [24])",
