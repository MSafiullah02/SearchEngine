We also compared children hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 to those who were admitted with 2008-09 seasonal influenza to identify potentially unique clinical characteristics of 2009 H1N1. For categorical variables, the percentages of patients in each category were calculated. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or the chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Percentages of expected characteristics of all hospitalized patients based on published population rates [6] were compared to observed characteristics using the chi square statistic. Factors that had a significant association (p,0.05) with ICU admission were put into a full model for multiple logistic regression analyses. A backward selection method was performed for model fitting and predictors with the highest p-value were taken out from the model one at a time until achievement of the most parsimonious model. Both p-value of individual effect and Akaike Information Criterion were used to assess model fitting. All analyses for this study were performed with SAS software, version 9.2. Table 1 . The median age of ICU patients was 6.7 years and of floor patients was 5.7 years (p = 0.02). The age grouping with the largest number of children admitted to the ICU was 4-5 years of age, whereas the largest age group of children admitted to the floor was less than 2 years of age ( Figure 2 ). Two hundred and three (65%) children had an underlying medical condition, of which asthma (26%), neurological disorders (24%), and obesity (19%) were the most common.

            "text": "We report the largest, single-center study of consecutively hospitalized children with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in a tertiary care children's hospital. Children less than 2 years of age have been reported to be at highest risk for hospitalization with seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza infections [7, 8, 9] , and it has been assumed they would also be at highest risk for admission to an intensive care unit. In support of this, a recent pediatric study from Argentina, reported that children less than 4 years were at highest risk for severe disease with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection [7] . In contrast to these reports, however, our study is the first to demonstrate that older hospitalized children with H1N1 were significantly more likely to require intensive care services than hospitalized children less than 2 years of age. The age group 4-5 years formed the largest group with severe 2009 H1N1 infection requiring intensive care services and the median age of hospitalized children was 6 years. This is in contrast to the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza season, where the median patient age was 1.8 years, and the median age of patients admitted to the PICU was 2.2 years. The reasons for the peak age differences in disease severity for 2009 H1N1 are unclear. One possible explanation is that younger children may have a less robust immune response to 2009 H1N1 and, therefore, not develop severe pulmonary disease which may be immune mediated. This would imply that the 2009 H1N1 virus elicits a different or more robust immune response than seasonal influenza. It is possible that the youngest children were thought to be at highest risk for severe disease and were targeted for earlier and more aggressive treatment which may have altered the course of their illness. Our study, however, does not support this hypothesis as almost 85% of children, both less than 2 years and greater than 2 years age, received oseltamivir within 24 hours of admission and there were no differences from time of onset of illness to admission between these two groups. Alternatively, in our community, the epidemic peak occurred approximately 6 weeks after the annual reopening of schools (start date for Denver public schools was August 19) which could have resulted in a larger number of older, school-aged children being exposed resulting in a larger number being infected with 2009 H1N1, some of whom developed severe infection.",

Additionally, there was a trend toward higher use of high frequency ventilation compared to the previous season. This is in contrast to the pediatric study from Argentina where only 17% of the ICU admissions required mechanical ventilation [7] , but similar to a children's case series from Johns Hopkins in which 46% required mechanical ventilation [12] . We speculate that the high incidence of ARDS in school age children may be related to an excessive immune response mediated by cytokines to this novel strain of influenza. Further studies are needed to determine whether particular virulence factors unique to the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus strain or host response to the virus explains this high severity of pulmonary dysfunction.",

Second, for 2009 H1N1 there were fifty-one patients included in our study that had a positive influenza IA, but did not have enough sample left for confirmatory PCR. Therefore, we may have included a very small number of patients who had a falsely positive influenza IA test. Based on our laboratory's experience with other specimens, however, we estimate that at most we may have had 9 false positives, 3% of our total study population. Additionally, we performed a subanalysis on the patients who were only PCR positive, which did not alter any of our findings. Third, although PCR testing was implemented during the 2008-09 season, a lower percentage of samples had confirmatory PCR testing performed.

Twenty-one patients had a positive blood culture, 8 of which were considered contaminants. Organisms considered true bacteremia included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococccus aureus (MSSA) (2), group A Streptococcus (1), Bacillus cereus (1), E. coli (1), Candida species (2), Moraxella catarhalis (1) Staphylococcus epidermidis, (1) and Streptococcus viridans(1). Of those with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, one had a lobar pneumonia and one died of meningitis shortly after admission. One patient with MSSA and the patient with GAS bacteremia had positive pleural cultures with these organisms also. Aspergillus flavus grew from a post mortem lung culture from one patient who died of respiratory failure.Multivaratiate logistic regression analysis identified four statistically significant risk factors in hospitalized children associated with admission to the ICU. These included older age (OR 1.07, 1.01-1.13, p = 0.02), underlying neurological condition (OR 2.16, 1.16-4.01, p = 0.02), hypoxia on admission (OR 2.9, 1.15-5.58, p = 0.002), and presenting with mental status changes (OR 12.54, 4.08-38.56, p,0.001).",
