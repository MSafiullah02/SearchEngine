Rapid epidemiological transition is also occurring, with the disease burden shifting from infectious to chronic diseases.\u2022Rapid urbanisation, population movement, and high-density living raise concerns about newly emerging infectious diseases, but these outbreaks have stimulated regional cooperation in information exchange and improvement in disease surveillance systems.\u2022Southeast Asia's peculiar geology contributes to it being the most disaster-prone region in the world, more susceptible to natural and man-made disasters affecting health, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and environmental pollution. Climate change along with rapid economic development could exacerbate the spread of emerging infectious diseases.\u2022Health systems in the region are a dynamic mix of public and private delivery and financing, with new organisational forms such as corporatised public hospitals, and innovative service delivery responding to competitive private health-care markets and growing medical tourism.\u2022The health-care systems are highly diverse, ranging from dominant tax-based financing to social insurance and high out-of-pocket payments across the region. There is a greater push for universal coverage of the population, but more needs to be done to ensure access to health services for the poor.\u2022Private health expenditure is increasing relative to government expenditure, where new forms of financing include user charges, improved targeting of subsidies, and greater cost recovery. Health-care financing could be further restructured in response to future demographic shifts in age-dependency, as in introduction of medical savings and social insurance for long-term care.\u2022There is potential for greater public-private participation with economic growth through ASEAN integration and further regional health collaboration, despite the current division of the region under two WHO regional offices.\n\n",

Nearly half (43%) of the region's population live in urban areas, which is less than the world average, but there is much variation between countries, from 15% in Cambodia to 100% in Singapore. The region's average population density of 133 people per km2 also masks substantial intercountry and in some instances intracountry differences. Population densities range from a low of 27 people per km2 in Laos to a high of 7022 per km2 in Singapore.16 Population densities in southeast Asia's only two megacities, Jakarta and Manila, are much higher, at more than 10 000 people per km2.17 Although their population sizes are similar (around 14 million), the greater sprawl of Manila and Jakarta make them less densely populated (ranked 15th and 17th in the world) than Mumbai and Delhi (ranked 1st and 13th, respectively). The next largest city in southeast Asia, Bangkok, is ranked 39th. Although urbanisation is expected to continue to rise in the region, urban slum populations seem to be less deprived than they are elsewhere, with about a quarter living in extreme shelter deprivation (defined by UN Habitat as a slum household lacking three or more of the following conditions: access to water, access to sanitation, access to secure tenure, a durable housing structure, and sufficient living space).18, 19\n",

With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before.51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profit and for-profit actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, financing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure health-care delivery and financing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums.52, 53\n",

A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at different stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5\u20138). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplified by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affluent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian financial crisis in 1997\u201398 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.",

While they were each finding ways to reform their health systems, the Asian financial crisis in 1997\u201398 posed more challenges for countries of the region. The depreciation of local currencies resulted in increased costs of imported drugs and other essential supplies, at the same time as access to basic health care was reduced for the most vulnerable population groups.54 However, reported spikes in suicides and mental illnesses in the other affected east Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were not as significant in southeast Asia.55 Following the lessons learnt from the past financial crisis, most countries have strengthened their social protection mechanisms and essential health services. There is a greater push among countries to increase universal coverage of basic health services, especially to vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.56, 57 Throughout the region, many innovative pro-poor financing schemes were implemented, such as the Health Card and 30-baht Schemes in Thailand, the Health Fund for the Poor in Vietnam, Health Equity Funds in Cambodia and Laos, and, even in affluent Singapore, the Medifund, a means-tested hospital fees subsidy scheme for indigent patients.",

However, crucial issues involve rising costs, future sustainability of centralised tax-financed systems, efficiency and quality of the public services, and higher public expectations. In both Malaysia and Singapore, the health-care systems are changing from government-dominated health services towards greater private-sector involvement. Attempts to privatise public hospitals have been controversial, thus resulting in many hybrid forms of corporatised entities that continue to be controlled or subsidised by governments.58, 59, 60, 61 Some of the most innovative and advanced forms of public\u2013private mix in health services have developed within the region, for example the restructuring or corporatisation of public hospitals in Singapore from as early as 1985 and the later Swadana (self-financing) hospitals in Indonesia.62 With the anticipated rise in the ageing population and future problems of intergenerational funding through pay-as-you-go mechanisms, there are experiments with new health-care financing such as compulsory medical savings and social insurance for long term care.63, 64, 65 Some countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia have radically decentralised their health-care systems with the devolution of health services to local governments, a restructuring that has affected aspects of systems performance and equity even though the impetus for decentralisation was mainly political.66 Consequently, to ensure increased financial coverage and affordability, many governments have passed laws to establish national health insurance systems and mandated universal coverage, although implementation is problematic. With existing policies of decentralisation and liberalisation, equity issues and poor infrastructure will continue to challenge the development of the health sector.57, 67\n",

There are clear contradictions inherent in the state seeking to prevent tobacco use in the interests of health, while actively promoting tobacco for the economic benefit of its population, resulting in both substantial and symbolic harm to efforts to implement the FCTC.70 For example, tobacco production is legitimised; rational policy principles are violated, and direct cooperation between the state and multinational tobacco corporations is made possible by modification of control policies. Tobacco exports within ASEAN also threaten the group's health solidarity.

Public policy in these countries cannot ignore such risks to health, which could have important social and economic consequences. Regional cooperation around disaster preparedness and in the surveillance of and health systems response to disease outbreaks has obvious advantages as a public health strategy. Concomitantly, all countries in the region are faced with large or looming chronic disease epidemics. Even in the poorest populations of the region, non-communicable diseases already kill more people than do communicable, maternal, and perinatal conditions combined, with many of these deaths occurring before old age. Greatly strengthened health promotion and disease prevention strategies are an urgent priority if the impressive health gains of the past few decades in most countries of the region are to be replicated. Further growth and integration of the ASEAN region should include as a priority enhanced regional cooperation in the health sector to share knowledge and rationalise health systems operations, leading to further public health gains for the region's diverse populations.",

Data were gathered after a call for information from regional experts on selected subthemes related to health (geography, history, demography, epidemiology, and health systems). Data collection took place between June, 2009, and June, 2010. Quantitative data were retrieved from databases of WHO, the World Bank, and the UN Population Fund, as well as from the scientific literature. Qualitative information was retrieved from grey literature (eg, WHO reports) as well as academic literature, including a mix of peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters from established publishers. Data were critically appraised and analysed to elaborate trends, projections, and associations between socioeconomic and population health measures.\n",
