Since no effective therapy exists for these viral infections, developing anti\u2010SARS agents against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge. In the early stage of the infection, SARS 3CL protease (3CLpro) is a key enzyme to cleave polyproteins to yield functional polypeptides for replication.6, 7 The 3CLpro is a cysteine protease containing a Cys\u2010His catalytic dyad. Because of its functional importance in the viral lifecycle, 3CLpro is considered an attractive target for the structure\u2010based design of drugs against SARS. Thus, numerous inhibitors of 3CLpro have been reported including peptide\u2010mimics8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and small molecules derived from natural products,13, 14, 15 anti\u2010viral agents,16, 17 anti\u2010malaria agents,18 or high throughput screening.19, 20, 21, 22\n",

As a result, this stable mutant protease makes it feasible for evaluating designed and synthesized inhibitors. Exploring useful inhibitors for SARS 3CLpro based on the substrate revealed that peptide aldehyde is a facile for designing an inhibitor for SARS 3CLpro. Through combinations of the systematic substitution of peptide aldehyde amino acid and the crystallographic analysis of the complexes, a leading inhibitor (Table 1, entry 1) emerged. This peptide\u2010based inhibitor has all of its side\u2010chain structures differing from the substrate non\u2010prime site sequence, Thr\u2010Ser\u2010Ala\u2010Val\u2010Leu\u2010Gln, except at the P3 site where the side\u2010chain was directed outward. Especially, substitution of Leu to cyclohexyl alanine (Cha) P2 of the peptide inhibitor gave a higher increase in inhibitory potency to SARS 3CLpro (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). Moreover, crystallographic analysis of the inhibitor complex provided an extended design of both deletion at the P5 residue and mutation providing a hetero atom at the P4 position of the inhibitor. Evaluation of IC50 in the protease and crystallographic analysis revealed that this down size design was clearly realized without any substantial decrease in potency (Table 1, entry 3).",

            "text": "Based on this wide range surveillance of the surroundings of the active sites by the peptide aldehyde inhibitor, a novel non\u2010peptide inhibitor based on interactions at the S1 and S2 sites of SARS 3CLpro was designed and synthesized.24 In the study, focusing on the fact that P1 and P2 sites interact with the catalytic dyad and hydrophobic pocket, respectively, compounds were designed by connecting the P2 site cyclohexyl group of the substrate\u2010based inhibitor to the main\u2010chain at \u03b1\u2212nitrogen atom of the P2 position Cha via a methylene linker. This strategy gave aza\u2010decaline as a central scaffold of the inhibitor with expected restricted conformational diversity of the P2 site. The designed compounds showed substantial inhibitory activity. By X\u2010ray crystallographic studies (Figure 1), it was confirmed that the aza\u2010decaline inhibitors were at the active site cleft of 3CLpro and the aza\u2010decaline scaffold was inserted into a large S2 pocket, while most of the S2 pocket was occupied. Interestingly, the stereochemistry on the aza\u2010decaline scaffold, (4aS,8aR) and (4aR,8aS), showed clear differences in inhibitory activities for SARS 3CLpro (Table 1 entries 4\u20106). Thus, starting from the substrate mimic peptide aldehyde as a leading compound, we have been developing nonpeptidic inhibitors by extracting fine structure\u2013activity relationships from these crystallographic analyses. However, this stereostructure\u2013activity relationship was not fully evaluated because of a shortage of samples for structural comparison.",

Briefly, starting from an enantio\u2010mixture of alcohol a, previously reported product24 by Diels\u2010Alder reaction, the primary alcohol was converted to azide and then the amino group (b). Amine b was condensed with N\u2010Boc\u2010N\u2010phenyl \u03b2\u2010alanine (Ph\u2010(Boc)bAla) to afford an enantio\u2010mixture of compound c, a precursor of the cyclization reaction. Amide c, in which the nitrogen of the amide group located at 5\u2010carbon apart from olefin, was cyclized with a Pd\u2010based catalysis.42 The obtained enantio\u2010mixture of an aza\u2010decaline derivative, olefin d was converted to diol and then to aldehyde by Lemieux\u2010Johnson oxidation. The resulting aza\u2010decaline\u2010derived aldehyde and H\u2010His(Trt)\u2010N(CH3)OCH3 were condensed via reductive amination to give a diastereo\u2010mixture of compound e. This diastereo\u2010mixture was separated and purified by flash column chromatography into 7e and 8e corresponding in stereochemistry to 7 and 8, respectively. Trt and Boc groups of 7e and 8e were removed and purified by a silica column. Finally, Weinreb amides were converted to aldehyde and then purified by RP\u2010HPLC. Yields were 3% and 1% for 7 and 8, respectively, based on the enantio\u2010mixture of olefin d.",

Figure 1 shows a summary of our previous structural analysis of the complex with 1\u20106. The chemistry of the aza\u2010decaline derived inhibitors including 7 and 8 was divided into three portions: histidine aldehyde (His\u2010al), aza\u2010decaline, and an N\u2010acyl part (Figure 1B). The His\u2010al part took an almost identical conformation and similarly interacted with the 3CLpro over the complexes examined. Briefly, His\u2010al is located at the active center of 3CLpro as aldehyde and an imidazole ring interacted with the catalytic dyad, thiol of Cys, and imidazole of His, respectively. Thus, the His\u2010al part functioned as a pharmacophore in these compounds. In contrast, the N\u2010acyl part of the aza\u2010decaline based inhibitors, 4, 5, and 6 were directed outward of 3CLpro and then opposite to the P3 to P4 sites of peptide mimic inhibitors, 1, 2, and 3. Based on these observations, compounds 7 and 8 were designed as making an aromatic ring of the N\u2010acyl part feasible to access the S3 or S4 pocket of 3CLpro via a relatively flexible \u03b2\u2010alanine linker and are expected to provide greater potency.

            "text": "Next, the S2 pocket was highlighted in the examining residues related with the second LV. Among these residues, it was revealed that configuration of the dominant Met49 is connected to the inhibitory effect of ligand binding. Figure 8A shows that the active site superimposed on the total 3CLpro structures 1\u20109. Structure 9 contains no inhibitor. The catalytic Cys\u2010His dyads were well overlapped. On the other hand, the configuration of Met49 side chains was separated into two groups. In one group, no ligand (9), Leu side chain (1), and (3R,4aS,8aR) aza\u2010decaline (4 and 8) were involved. In the other group, the Cha side chain (2 and 3) and (3S,4aR,8aS) aza\u2010decaline (5, 6 and 7) were involved. Inhibitors in the latter group had greater potency in comparison with the corresponding chemical structures. Thus, the S2 pocket is enlarged on the potent inhibitors by reorientation of the Met49 side chain. Figure 8B shows the correlation between the X score of each complex corresponding to the second LV model and each RMSD of the Met49 side chain heavy atom of complexes from that of structure 9. These values were strongly correlated with r = 0.77. Thus, the main contribution to the second LV was the orientation of the Met49 side chain followed by enlarging the S2 pocket. The isobutyl group of the Leu side chain was not sufficient for inducing this reorientation. Even if a large functional group such as aza\u2010decaline occupied the S2 pocket, the angle between the plane consisting of the chair\u2010chair configuration of aza\u2010decaline and to Met49 was critical for the configurational change, which can be controlled by the stereochemistry of position 3 of the aza\u2010decaline scaffold. These analyses revealed that the aza\u2010decaline scaffold with stereochemistry of S at position 3 is a novel scaffold for designing an inhibitor to 3CLpro. As mentioned in inhibitor\u2010based analysis, optimized regioisomers need to be elucidated. The key feature of the interaction in the S2 pocket gives a novel strategy for developing a new inhibitor.",

This COMBINE strategy may, at least in part, represent the flexibility65, 66, 67 of the protein upon ligand binding. In this research, not protein dynamic structural changes, but configurational change of side chains by inhibitor binding and their substantial control of inhibitory potency were detected. This fact highlights the advantages of the COMBINE method. Together with ligand\u2010based analysis and the COMIBINE analysis focusing on protein structure, a peptide mimetic inhibitor and development of a small molecular weight molecule is feasible. These sets of training on COMBINE will be adapted to modeled complexes such as docking simulations.",

For aza\u2010decaline based inhibitors, the potencies decreased during design. Structural analysis revealed that orientation of the substituent on the aza\u2010decaline scaffold was not suitable for interacting with the protein. The COMBINE analysis revealed that the volume of the S2 pocket perturbed by stereochemistry of the ligand is important for inhibitor potency. This is derived as the second LV (10% explanation of the X matrix). Further design and synthesis of inhibitors are expected.",
