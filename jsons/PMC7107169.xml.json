Respiratory diseases represent a large problem to the poultry industry because of their multifactorial nature (Roussan et al., 2008). Different pathogens such as avian influenza (AI), virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV), and infectious bronchitis (IBV) are associated with high mortality rates in broiler chicken flocks (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008). These pathogens are of major significance and have a large economic impact because they are able to induce disease independently or in association with each other (Roussan et al., 2008). The failure of control of poultry diseases in Egypt is a final result of retarded biosecurity, shortage of vaccine coverage, and/or the mismatch between circulating and vaccine strains.",

Clinically unapparent, infected free-ranging ducks and geese, as well as mixed species backyard holdings, are suspected to play a pivotal role in avian influenza epidemiology in Egypt (Aly et al., 2008). The detection of the AI-H9N2 subtype during 2010 and 2011 in chickens and commercial quail was an additional challenge facing the poultry industry in Egypt (El-Zoghby et al., 2012). As both H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are endemic in Egypt, the genetic characterization of AIVs is necessary for screening the dynamic evolution of each subtype and potential reassortment events.",

In Egypt, IBV has been recognized since the 1950s (Sheble et al., 1986) with the isolation of an IB variant shown by neutralization tests to be closely related to the Dutch variant D3128 and subsequently variants related to Mass (Eid, 1998), D3128, D274, D-08880, 4/91 were characterized. Novel genotypes endemic in Egypt represented by the isolate Egypt/Beni-Suef/ 01 and nephropathogenic IBV strains Egypt/Beni-Suef/03, which are closely related to Israeli variant 2 and Mass serotype, respectively, were isolated from poultry (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006). Recently, other novel genotypes were reported in Egypt and classified as Egyptian variant I (e.g., CK/Eg/BSU-1,4,5/2011) and Egyptian variant II (e.g., CK/Eg/BSU-2,3/2011) (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012).",

The onset of clinical respiratory disease and the highest mortalities in investigated flocks were mainly reported as early as 20 days of age. The lack of vaccination against AI-H9N2 in the majority of the investigated flocks could explain the appearance of disease signs at early ages (supplementary Table 1). Moreover, the high rate of mixed respiratory viral infections observed further indicates a potential immunosuppressive role of AI-H9N2. It was reported that early H9N2 infection causes atrophy and lymphoid depletion of the thymus, and probably also some other lymphoid organs, causing immunosuppression and predispose the chickens to secondary infections (Hadipour et al., 2011).",

The early exposure to H9N2 viruses possibly provoked cell-mediated immunity against H5N1 due to their similar internal genes. Therefore, partial protection by what is called the \u201cprotected window\u201d after H9N2 infection can mask the lethal infection of H5N1 that may go unnoticed while the virus is shed by infected birds. This is a potentially important problem for countries such as Egypt that use H5N1 vaccines and cull flocks only when clinical disease is evident (Khalenkov et al., 2009). Although co-circulation of H5N1 and H9N2 has been suggested to limit the spread and the epizootiologic pattern of the infections for both subtypes (Arafa et al., 2013), their co-circulation in susceptible host populations can increase the likelihood of generating novel reassortant viruses with public health implications (Guan et al., 1999).",

Therefore, partial IBV S1 gene phylogenetics were analyzed and it was revealed that 4 isolates were closely related to recent Egyptian IBV isolate Eg/BSU-2/2011 (accession JX174185) that was isolated in northern and middle Egypt and showed a unique genetic signature and subsequently was suggested as a new genotype variant 2 (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012). One isolate, Ck/Eg/BSU-FA-KB23/2013 (accession KR010940) was distant from the other 4 isolates and it was relatively closer to the nephropathogenic Israeli isolate IS/885/00 (Meir et al., 2004). The strain (IS/885/00) also shared 96.6% S1 similarity to the Egyptian isolate Eg/Beni-Suef/01 (accession JX174183).",

The HVRs are associated with virus-neutralizing antigenic sites and are located between the amino acid residues 38 to 67 (HVR-1), 97 to 141 (HVR-2), and 274 to 387 (HVR-3) (Moore et al., 1997). In this study, amino acid substitutions at virus neutralization (VN) critical antigenic epitopes were observed in IBV isolates. At position 296; QTA/HTA or QTA/STA and position 378; PRG/PRL substitutions were previously documented to cause reduced vaccine protection and generation of IBV escape mutant (Yu et al., 2001). Additionally, the widespread use of various vaccines, including illegally imported heterologous IBVs vaccines, may also exert pressure resulting in the increase of new genetic variants. In addition to serotype changes, the genetic variation may result in changes of the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the virus (Cavanagh et al., 1992).",

All Egyptian isolates, including those of the current study, are grouped within group B of G1-like lineage according to (Monne et al., 2012). Though the isolated H9N2 viruses showed minor evolution based on genetic analysis of their HA gene, few amino acid substitutions, which are indicative of antibody selection pressure on H9N2 viruses in the field, were determined. Among those substitutions which were observed were that in the overlapping area of antigenic epitope at position 127 previously reported by (Kaverin et al., 2004), receptor binding sites 128 and 180 (H9 numbering) (Wan et al., 2014), and antigenic epitope 2 at position 182 (Figure 4).

Circulation of variant IBV strains with multiple mutations at the virus neutralizing epitopes in the S1 genes with continuous emergence of new variants were observed. Public health implications may arise due to the co-circulation of AI-H9N2 with H5N1 in susceptible host populations. The AI, IBV, and NDV viruses\u2019 interference and co-infections in terms of altering the severity of clinical signs and lesions need further investigation. Identification of factors that influence avian respiratory virus interference will provide new insights in the pathogenesis and subsequently improvement of control programs could be achieved.",
