Prescriptive analytics on outbreak data through algorithms or models can simulate possible outcomes and help answer: \"what should we do\" when the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of local or international concern. Decisionmaking about travel advisories and quarantines is done locally, and each locale has its own level of preparedness for an outbreak. Some areas have used innovative approaches; for example, Taiwan integrated its health insurance database with biometric entry and exit data to generate real-time alerts based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid in case identification and has used this data to decide whom to quarantine and track at the border 8 . The global health security index (GHSI) encompasses disease prevention, detection, reporting, and response capabilities for each country. Countries with a higher GHSI like Singapore can identify undetected cases through increased epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing, leading to improved accuracy regarding disease prevalence 9 .",

When there are major differences between COVID-19 testing strategies, as there has been in this pandemic, it is difficult to make direct comparisons accurately as the testing strategies can skew case counts 23 . Accurate estimation of the reproduction ratio depends on having comprehensive, diverse, and heterogeneous data sets to overcome the limitations of individual localized data sources. For COVID-19, countries that conducted comparatively high numbers of tests had lower mortality rates even though they reported high case counts that alarmed the public in the short run 23 . Tracking the viral mutations of COVID-19 cases in New York suggests that most cases were traced to travelers returning from Europe, not Asia as originally expected 24 . Missing this hidden spread due to insufficient testing and screenings at the borders meant that the suspension of air travel and mandatory quarantines for travelers from Europe occurred too late. measures work.

Aggregators of local media reports and news feeds, such as DXY, Google News, Baidu News, SOS Info, and Moreover are useful in identifying new cases early on. Monitoring social media feeds like Facebook and Twitter as well as trends in Google search terms can be useful to have an idea about what is present in a community or what people are worried about. Tracking animal, agriculture, and environmental health data for potential sources of human disease is possible via the https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jamia Wildlife Data Integration Network (WDIN), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). A common way to disseminate data about infections like COVID-19 is through data visualizations and simulated disease models. These data products enable the public, policy makers, and scientists to quickly understand the global spread of COVID-19 at the population level, enabling forecasting at the local level. HealthMap 11-12 provides an accurate, continuously updated, and usable visualization tracking the global spread of COVID-19 over time. The John Hopkins dashboard tracks cases in different geographic areas across the globe 13 . The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has developed a real-time data visualization and forecasting tool based on geo-coded epidemiological information that includes (when available): symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history 14 . These examples of data and data product flow across geographic borders are extremely useful to public health professionals for many purposes such as accelerating the pharmaceutical development pipeline, for triaging clinician resources to a locale, and for making decisions about intensive care unit rooms, where to build temporary hospitals (e.g., Boston Hope Medical Center 15 ), or where to boost supplies of personal protection equipment, ventilators, or diagnostic tests 16 . Providing data analytical tools for organizations that cannot share data or have limited analytical resources can also be helpful to help with virus response, better-coordinated care, reporting, and organizational operations. The health sectors in advanced economies can help developing countries via cross-border data product sharing, as they did with the Congo in the 2018 Ebola outbreak. This included early screening (e.g., outbreak detection), continuing disease surveillance, advice regarding travel advisories, and ex situ medical treatment (e.g., medical tourism) and helped result in improved quality of care, and reductions in cost. Global virtual hackathons focused on COVID-19 such as the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI 17 ) international communities' study-a-thon (March 26-29, 2020) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hackathon (April 3-5, 2020) have also spurred the development of cross-border clinical research studies and cross-border entrepreneurship, respectively. The output of these efforts are open source ideas and tools to solve a variety of problems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The OHDSI efforts are focusing on a global baseline characterization of COVID-19 patients as well as the safety of Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, drawing upon collaborators and data spread across the globe.",
