Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) has become an important CAP pathogen in endemic areas. The presence of the gene for the production of the toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is the main characteristic of CA-MRSA. PVL toxin causes leukocyte destruction and necrosis of the tissues. Presence of cavitation in the lung of a patient with pneumonia is a frequent characteristic in CA-MRSA, and is usually associated with skin lesions [34]. Since the recommendation of current international guidelines for severe CAP is empiric therapy with \u03b2-lactam with macrolide or fluoroquinolone, which may not provide adequate protection against MRSA, microbiological diagnosis of these cases is very important [35].",

Currently, between 20% and 30% of pneumococcus disease cases worldwide are MDR (resistant to more than three classes of antibiotics) [48,49]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that therapeutic failure involving \u03b2-lactams has not been reported among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who are infected with pneumococci that are not susceptible to \u03b2-lactams. A reasonable explanation for this is that the mechanisms of resistance to penicillin are due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to decreased binding affinity. Pharmacodynamic studies show that a time above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of about 40% of the dosing interval (T > 40% MIC) is predictive of bacteriological efficacy for \u03b2-lactams. Among the oral agents, aminopenicillins and cephalosporins are able to attain these levels in the lung for fully susceptible strains, and even for pneumococci with penicillin MICs of 2\u20134 g/mL.",

Regarding the consumption of antibiotics in the hospital, HAP accounts for approximately 50%, these data showing the impact on health resources [52,53,54,55]. Pneumonia that arises more than 48 to 72 h after endotracheal intubation is defined as Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is considered the main nosocomial infection in the ICU [56,57,58]. VAP represented approximately 70% to 80% of all cases of HAP acquired in the ICU.",
