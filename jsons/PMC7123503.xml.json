These medical decision-making modalities often involve trying to find a balance between beneficence and non-maleficence, as well as the concepts of paternalism and autonomy . Historically paternalism was the dominant model and the way that most physicians practiced. Paternalism is best described by the old adage \u201cthe Doctor knows best.\u201d It is the concept that a person in authority knows best, and therefore their opinion can/should override the patient\u2019s preferences. In paternalism, beneficence is valued over autonomy (Jonsen et al. 2006). In the 1960s and 1970s, however, with societal and social changes, patients began to demand more involvement in the medical decision and choices that were made regarding their own bodies, and what is known as the \u201cAge of Autonomy\u201d began.",

In an ideal situation, a clinician gives the patient all of the medical information necessary for the patient to make the best, informed decision for themselves, but, additionally, the physician gives the patient their recommendation as to the medical treatment option that they feel would be best for that patient. The clinician should take into account what they know of the patient\u2019s values when giving their professional opinion (Jonsen et al. 2006). Shared decision-making does not necessarily mean that both parties are in perfect agreement; however, it is the clinician\u2019s obligation to do their best to ensure that their patient is well informed and allow the patient to participate in and direct their treatment choices.",

Finally, qualitative futility is the judgment that the goal that might be attained is not worthwhile.

He presents with chest pain and describes the pain as a feeling of heaviness and pressure that spreads across his chest and up into his jaw. The pain has been occurring with activity for several weeks but has occurred at rest for two nights this past week. He has an impressive smoking history: He has smoked > 2 packs per day since he was 15 years old. He quit smoking 7 years ago when he was diagnosed with COPD but has not had any further medical treatment since that time. The electrocardiogram (EKG) is largely normal, and troponins are negative; however, the resting angina is concerning for acute coronary syndrome. You consult the cardiologist, who recommends that the patient go for angiogram and possible stenting. You happen to be outside the room when the cardiologist\u2019s staff obtains consent from your patient for the procedure, and you notice that none of the major complications of catheterization are mentioned: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or even death. In fact, the procedure is not explained well; it is explained to the patient as a very minor procedure that is necessary to prevent death. After the consent form is signed, you go in to talk to your patient; he is very concerned.

However, there are some general standards that all physicians should be aware of. In years past, most states used the reasonable physician standard: What would a reasonable and prudent physician tell a patient (regarding a specific treatment or procedure)? Today most state laws have changed their requirements to the reasonable patient standard: What information would a reasonable patient need to know to make a rational decision? Taking these standards one step further is the subjective standard or individual preference standard. This would involve a patient being informed on the basis of his individual attitudes/beliefs/culture/lifestyle/goals of care. The information provided is specifically tailored to a particular patient\u2019s need for information and understanding. This standard requires that the physician get to know their patient reasonably well enough to know some of their preferences, beliefs, values, and goals. For example, while a 0.001 % change of numbness and decreased mobility of the patient\u2019s pinky finger following a procedure may not be a risk factor that would be important to mention to most patients, if the patient is a world famous concert pianist, using the subjective standard, it may be a risk that needs to be discussed.

They propose a process whereby the benefits of nondisclosure or the disclosure of biased, partial, or altered information is viewed in the context of minimizing the patient\u2019s suffering and/or increasing the patient\u2019s overall well-being. In the situation with Mr. Jones above, this would entail the clinician asking themselves whether nondisclosure would prevent suffering and then further exploring whether the benefits of nondisclosure outweigh the consequences of withholding the truth. The clinician also needs to consider other courses of action and whether the patient would consider the withheld and/or altered information to be important.",

Specifically this was seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) epidemic, cases of multidrug resistant TB, and most recently with the Ebola virus. Additionally, this can and may be seen with the concern for the use of infectious agents for bioterrorism. The use of quarantine and isolation, particularly when done forcibly and against someone\u2019s will, can be ethically problematic. Some feel that quarantine measures are necessary in order to protect public health and are essential to prevent and control communicable disease spread; however, others believe that it violates a person\u2019s right of liberty, self-determination, and autonomy . The American Medical Association has developed a report addressing this particular issue (American Medical Association 2006). In this report they state, \u201cThe medical profession, in collaboration with public health colleagues, must take an active role in ensuring that those interventions are based on science and are applied according to certain ethical considerations.\u201d Their recommendations for the medical profession are as follows:",

Further complicating this assessment is the frequent overlap between patients with genuine pain issues and coexisting medication misuse. As a health-care provider, it is imperative that you do not facilitate a drug habit; however, it is equally vital that you address any legitimate pain your patient is having. Indeed, pain is a common reason for patients to seek health care. Pain agreements are a way to equitably manage pain issues with patients. Components of a pain agreement may include an agreement to avoid improper use of pain medications, agreements to only obtain pain medication from one provider (you), limitations on replacing medication, agreement for random drug screening, appointment terms, and terms for disciplinary termination of the pain contract (Fishman et al. 1999) . As physicians can be liable for both facilitating a drug habit and for failure to address a patient\u2019s medical issues, a pain contract may help protect them legally. It is important, however, to have equal implementation and enforcement of pain contracts in order to avoid bias . Many patients with uncontrollable chronic pain could benefit from a referral to a pain management clinic, if one is available.",

Interestingly, however, it is physicians who score lower on empathy scales that are more likely to perceive patients as difficult. At a glance, the patient described above could be described as difficult, especially given his less than amicable separation from his previous health-care provider and his stated purpose of seeking narcotics. How would this patient\u2019s care have been affected if the provider had not noticed his military-related tattoo and assumed the worst? Patients often complain that doctors do not listen to them; clinicians need be aware of their preconceived perceptions and utilize listening skills that will help clinical facts overcome these preconceived perceptions (Fiester 2012).",
