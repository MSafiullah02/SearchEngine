Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, the Level I Emergency Response was implemented across all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China on January 29. It means the most stringent nationwide implementation of public life restrictions had been started in China. All cities were under partial lockdown and most transportation had been ceased aimed at preventing the outbreak from spreading further. Further, all major Chinese Spring Festival celebrations had been canceled, and every citizen should comply with home quarantine requirements. Schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories were temporarily closed until the effective containment of the outbreak (Chen et al., 2020b.)",

Due to the infectivity, epidemic, and uncertainty of infectious diseases, strong protective measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation are required (Ji et al., 2017). It can be found that several psychological changes may arise in not only medical staff but also average citizens, being feared, anxiety, depression, psychological unrest or uncertainty (Kamara et al., 2017; Otte et al., 2017; Pappas et al., 2009). Post-epidemic investigations detected that most confirmed patients often suffer from significant feelings of mild distress or depression, anxiety disorders, shame, stigma, and grief (Kamara et al., 2017), while people who have undergone quarantine tend to be aware of the fear and risk perceptions (Tracy et al., 2009; Van Bortel et al., 2016). Based on the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), research groups used to analyze the psychological impact of the epidemic outbreak on medical staff or survivors (Cai et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Tanaka et al., 2016). So far, only limited researches have analyzed the psychological symptoms and experiences of people during the COVID-19 without the SCL-90 (Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). However, the reliability and validity of SCL-90 which is recognized as a classical scale have been tested in China (Chen and Zhang, 2004; Cheng and Hamid, 1996; Zhong et al., 2013), and the norm of SCL-90 for ordinary Chinese citizens was developed in 1986 (Jin et al., 1986). Therefore, it is imperative to use the SCL-90 to investigate the psychological symptoms of more groups including ordinary citizens in this epidemic.",

Of the ten sub-questions of PSY, two were answered positively, including thoughts of not being their own and that they should be punished for being themselves.

            "text": "In the high-risk group, the GSI T-score of the group under-18 was the highest in terms of the severity of psychological symptoms. On January 27, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China notified that all universities, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens should not begin to function until the epidemic has been effectively controlled. Further, students should stay at home during the Spring Festival, and college students are not allowed to return in advance without school approval (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2020). Teaching should be carried out online. It can be predicted that as minors grow up, they will undergo many physiological, psychological, cognitive, and social changes (Rytil\u00e4-Manninen et al., 2016). Minors were more likely to experience positive psychological symptoms such as panic, anxiety, and depression during the epidemic affected by the delayed start of the school term and the use of online teaching methods. Among the occupations, medical staff had the most severe psychological symptoms. During the outbreak of infectious diseases, medical staff are frontline workers, who tend to show more intense anxiety, fear, and stigma than ordinary citizens (Curto et al., 2018; Kamara et al., 2017). Previous research has shown that the psychological symptoms of females are generally higher than that of males (Lim et al., 2018). However, data from our study show that during the epidemic, men's psychological symptoms were generally higher than women's, which may be because most of the deaths resulting from COVID-19 occurred in men ( N. Chen et al., 2020). With regard to education level, the psychological symptoms of those who graduated from high school were the most serious. In China, most of the migrant workers are below the undergraduate level who have to leave their hometown and take public transportation (such as high-speed rail, trains, and planes) to work in big cities. Some scholars have concluded that the psychological symptoms level of migrant workers in large Chinese cities is generally higher than those of local citizens (Ji et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2012).",

In other words, the above three groups account for more of the high-risk group. The common characteristics in these three groups in China are that their jobs are not stable, and wages are greatly affected by market fluctuations. Some studies have analyzed that the mental state of agricultural workers and found that it is generally higher than that of other citizens (Zhong et al., 2013). People in these other occupations (such as middle and small-sized enterprise owners, individual industrial and commercial households) may lose their jobs or go bankrupt due to the impact of the epidemic. Staff may face layoffs and salary cuts, while fruits and vegetables may go unsold, as they cannot be gathered and processed, causing loss of money. Migrant workers may not be able to return to work due to the impact of the epidemic, and their wages may be damaged. With regard to academic qualifications, those with high school education and below accounted for more of the high-risk group. Some studies have found that people's psychological symptoms decrease with the increase in academic qualifications, which is consistent with the finding of this study (Assari, 2018; Erickson et al., 2016). Among all age groups, those aged 50 and older accounted for more number in the high-risk group, which may be due to the average age of death in COVID-19 being 55.5 years ( N. Chen et al., 2020), and ordinary people are usually anxious about being infected or suspecting they have been infected. Studies have shown that SOM, OC, and PHOB increase with age (Hessel et al., 2002). Moreover, the proportion of women in the high-risk group was slightly higher than that of men. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies (Prunas et al., 2012; Urb\u00e1n et al., 2014). During the epidemic, women are often more sensitive to the guarantee of family stability, the main bearer and implementer of educating children and the caregiver and therapist of family members\u2019 emotions. Therefore, multiple stresses have affected women's psychological and physical health.",

For minors under 18 years of age, government education departments, schools and teachers should guide them to understand the epidemic correctly. They should also aim to ease panic and fear by establishing an optimistic and positive attitude. For middle-aged and older people over 50 years of age, the government should encourage the children of this group to explain the popular science of the epidemic and to accompany them more often to ensure good psychological health.2)Provide targeted psychological intervention and assistance to special groups severely affected by the epidemic. Establish a professional psychological assistance organization, based on ensuring the health and safety of frontline medical staff, regularly check the psychological status of medical staff, provide psychological intervention services for medical staff and their families to protect their psychological health. For groups such as other, enterprise staff and agricultural workers, the government should publicly and transparently announce the development of the epidemic and adopt appropriate subsidy policies to alleviate the economic pressure on the general population caused by the epidemic. The media should objectively report the progress of the epidemic and increase publicity for psychological counseling.3)Focus on the psychological health of people with lower education levels, the government should adopt a simple and easy-to-understand method to increase publicity efforts, to allow the general population to have an objective understanding of the epidemic to reduce unnecessary panic and stress.4)Pay attention to the psychological health of women and sensitive groups such as divorce or widowed individuals and provide professional psychological assistance and counseling.\n",

First, the study population is based on a voluntary selection, which may introduce a self-selection bias. Second, we conducted measurements only at a single time point, which might not reflect long-term exposure to the dimensions related to Chinese\u2019 psychological health when facing the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, people's psychology could be different with the development of the epidemic. Finally, considering the average citizens were quarantined at home during the epidemic, this study used an online questionnaire and the snowball sampling strategy to collect data. As such, there was an oversampling of a particular network such as highly educated people, leading to selective bias in data results. Therefore, the results of this study should not be extrapolated to the whole of China. Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides valuable information on the initial psychological responses of average citizens after all the provinces of China adopted the Level I Emergency Response to the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition to individual differences, social factors (such as infection rates, transparency of government information disclosure, media orientation) can also affect psychological symptoms. We are also studying the analysis of psychological symptoms of ordinary Chinese citizens during the epidemic of social factors. More importantly, our results could be used as a reference which can help psychological intervention during the COVID-19 and prevent and control the psychological impact of the epidemic on average citizens.",
