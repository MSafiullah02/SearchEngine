Among a total of 44,672 patients with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1023 (2.3%) patients were dead as of February 11, 2020, the last day of follow-up. The fatality rate was increasing with ages and even up to 14.8% in patients aged above 80 years old (see Fig. 1a). The prevalence of COVID-19 between men and women was pretty close (51.4% vs. 48.6%), which is different from previous report (58.1% vs. 41.9%) [3]. Notably, the fatality rate of male patients was significantly higher than that of female patients (RR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.47\u20131.89, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 1b). Furthermore, cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75, 95%CI = 5.40\u20138.43, p < 0.001), hypertension (HR = 4.48, 95%CI = 3.69\u20135.45, p < 0.001), diabetes (RR = 4.43, 95%CI = 3.49\u20135.61, p < 0.001), respiratory disease (RR = 3.43, 95%CI = 2.42\u20134.87, p < 0.001), and cancers (RR = 2.926, 95%CI = 1.34\u20136.41, p = 0.006) were the risk factors for fatality of patients with COVID-19.\n",

Moreover, we concluded that patients with comorbidities had a significantly high death risk. Admittedly, due to the unavailability of individual patient data, we could not exclude the influence of age on the conclusion because old patients were more likely to have the underlying comorbidities. We would like to provide a reminder to the physicians that more intensive surveillance or treatment should be considered for male patients and those with comorbidities. Further and larger studies are needed to validate the findings.",
