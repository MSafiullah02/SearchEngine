Emerging diseases are broadly defined as those whose rates have increased in the last two decades [1] . From a blood safety perspective, current attention has largely focused on those recently emerged agents that may be transmitted by transfusion. In Europe, particularly the UK, measures have been implemented to address concerns regarding potential transmission of prions associated with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [2, 3] . The recent emergence and continued spread of West Nile virus in the USA has led to the rapid implementation of nucleic acid testing (NAT) to reduce the incidence of transfusion transmission [4, 5] . Lastly, following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), blood collection agencies and test manufacturers rapidly developed measures to address potential transmission of this coronavirus, but as yet these measures have fortunately not required implementation [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 224, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 554, "end": 557, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 558, "end": 560, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 757, "end": 759, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1044, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "While transfusion medicine has been focused on recently emerged agents, several agents, first described decades ago, represent ongoing blood safety risks that have not been adequately addressed and in some respects continue to 'fly under the radar' . Perhaps foremost among these agents are several species of Babesia known to cause human infections. The first case of human babesiosis, which was also fatal, was reported in 1957 from what was then known as Yugoslavia [7] . In 1966, the first US case was reported on Nantucket Island off the New England coast [8] . Since then, hundreds of cases of human babesiosis have been reported in the USA, and an additional 30 cases have been reported in Europe [9] [10] [11] [12] . The known geographical range of the parasite continues to expand owing to environmental and ecological changes, enhanced epidemiological investigations and an overall increase in public health awareness. From a blood safety perspective, transfusion-transmitted infections involving Babesia spp. have become increasingly problematic in the USA, with progressively more reported each year [13] . However, despite epidemiological data suggesting that Babesia spp. are a growing blood safety concern, particularly in the USA, they continue to be overshadowed by other, often newly emerged, agents.

The tick vector deposits thousands of infective sporozoites in the dermis during the latter stages of feeding (i.e. after 48 h) [10] . Within the human host, sporozoites infect erythrocytes and become trophozoites that replicate by binary fission, producing the characteristic Maltese cross forms seen in some cases (e.g. WA-1) [32] . Replication, in turn, leads to cell rupture, lysis, and release of merozoites that infect additional erythrocytes. These replicate cycles can produce high levels of parasitemia and haemoglobinuria within the host. Asymptomatic disease is not uncommon for infections with B. microti and often goes undetected. Symptomatic infections with B. microti are generally mild and selflimiting, producing flu-like symptoms that appear 1-6 weeks postinfection. Characteristic symptoms include fever, headache, chills, drenching sweats, myalgia and malaise, but these usually abate within a few weeks. More severe disease complications (including haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, haematuria and renal failure) have been observed in infants, elderly, asplenic and immunocompromised patients.

More recent studies have corroborated the presence of parasitaemia among blood donors with antibodies to B. microti , which in some cases persists for months [13, 36] . However, this latter study also demonstrated that some patients infected with B. microti produce long-term elevated antibody titres in the absence of measurable parasitaemia. This suggests that some patients maintain chronic babesial infections that are below the limit of detection by PCR: parasites may only circulate in the peripheral blood at extremely low numbers, on an intermittent basis or they may be restricted to sequestered tissue or organ sites. Indeed, recrudescence of measurable parasitaemia among serologically positive patients has been reported in several instances, in the absence of obvious re-exposure to infected vectors, thus possibly indicating underlying, silent infections [35, 36] . These observations support earlier contentions by Gorenflot et al ., who suggested that immunocompetent, spleen-intact people may act as asymptomatic carriers of babesiosis [37] . Alternatively, it has been suggested that chronic infections associated with Babesia spp. may be linked to the parasite's ability to undergo antigenic variation, which is expressed on the cell surface of the infected erythrocyte [38] . While antigenic variation has not been implicated as an evasion strategy for B. microti , this parasite's considerable allelic polymorphism may allow for frequent recombinant events leading to mixed infections, thereby allowing some parasites to evade recognition by the immune response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 218, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1094, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1278, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1514, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Symptoms"}, {"text": "Diagnosis of babesiosis, in part, relies upon the symptomatology described above, but the non-specific nature of the symptoms often makes an accurate clinical diagnosis difficult.

Direct detection can be enhanced by inoculating susceptible rodents, hamsters or mice for B. microti and by inoculating gerbils for B. divergens , with patient blood.

The rapid onset of symptoms (e.g. haemoglobinuria) associated with B. divergens makes serological detection impractical in many patients, because the infection may prove fatal before detectable antibodies are present. The gold standard for serological detection of B. microti infection is the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which uses infected rodent red cells as the antigen source. The presence of IgM is indicative of a recent or acute infection, but the failure to demonstrate IgG on a subsequent sample may suggest a false-positive result [41, 43] . While IgM is present only during the acute phase of disease, IgG persists for months, sometimes years. Critical for successful identification of babesial infection is the use of appropriate antigen sources for each agent. For example, sera from a patient, in Washington State, with a recent B. divergens -like infection did not react with B. microti or WA-1 antigens, but showed marked IFA reactivity to antigens of B. divergens [20] .

In contrast, the Canadian case involved a donor who apparently became infected with B. microti while in the USA, and later donated an infectious unit of blood upon returning to Canada.

However, a clear correlation between a donor's ability to recall a tick exposure and demonstrable Babesia infection could not be made, largely because the sensitivity of such questions is low [52] .

As already discussed, IFA and ELISA formats for Babesia exist, but the former is not automated and the latter are largely developmental in nature. Despite these issues, the development of a serological test for B. microti is both practical and feasible given the host's robust immune response.

Unfortunately, a regionalized approach is not only problematic from a manufacturer's perspective, but raises logistic issues for blood collection organizations. Perhaps the larger issue is how the transfusion medicine community can persuade assay manufacturers to develop tests for agents that may have limited markets. As economics clearly play a role, a simple solution to this problem is not readily available.

One approach is to avoid blood collection in highly endemic areas during the periods of peak transmission (i.e. June to September) [51] . However, reports of persistent, year-round infections in some blood donors suggest that selective blood collection would only partially reduce the risk of transmission, while negatively impacting local blood availability. Other approaches include leucoreduction, filtration and pathogen reduction, but each poses their own set of technical barriers. Leucoreduction would appear to be ill suited for Babesia spp. because the agent is intra-erythrocytic. In contrast, filtration technology would need to differentiate between infected and noninfected red cells. This approach, however, may have some merit as infected red cells will probably present different surface antigens from uninfected cells. Feasibility of pathogenreduction technology for reducing or inactivating Babesia spp. has already been demonstrated [68, 69] .

However, the distribution of Babesia spp. appears to be greater than originally thought, and the parasite is increasingly implicated in transfusion-transmitted cases, particularly among patients who receive large amounts of blood and are highly susceptible to babesial infection (e.g. elderly, asplenic and immunocompromised). The lack of a consensus approach in preventing transmission of Babesia spp. remains problematic and may not be easily resolved in the absence of licensed blood screening tests. One of the greatest hurdles in addressing Babesia spp. is persuading manufacturers to develop approaches, particularly screening assays, for what is perceived to be a limited market. To overcome this obstacle, a concerted effort among government agencies, blood collection organizations and the public health community is needed to encourage the development of suitable interventions for Babesia spp. In summary, now that the Babesia spp. are clearly visible on our radar screen, appropriate interventions should be considered in order to reduce the blood safety risks posed by this agent.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and future directions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States", "authors": [], "year": 1992, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "34--112", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Possible transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by blood transfusion", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Llewelyn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Hewitt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Rsg", "middle": [], "last": "Knight", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Amar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Cousens", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Mackenzie", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Will", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "363", "issn": "", "pages": "417--421", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The spectrum of safety: variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United Kingdom", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Ironside", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Semin Hematol", "volume": "40", "issn": "", "pages": "16--22", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "West Nile Virus Transmission Investigation Team: Transmission of West Nile virus through blood transfusion in the United States in 2002", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Pealer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Marfin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Petersen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Lanciotti", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Page", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Stramer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Stobierski", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Signs", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Newman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Kapoor", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Goodman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Chamberland", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "349", "issn": "", "pages": "1236--1245", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Update.
