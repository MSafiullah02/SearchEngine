            "text": "T he zoonotic introductions and ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pose a global threat (1, 2) necessitating continuous serosurveillance to monitor virus spread alongside the development of vaccine and antibodies as countermeasures. Both approaches require validated assays to evaluate specific antibody responses. Although MERS-CoV serologic assays have been developed (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) , those detecting functional antibodies cannot be applied in all laboratories and can require Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Recombinant protein-based immunoassays are easier to operate and standardize and do not require BSL-3 containment. However, MERS-CoV protein-based assays developed thus far can only detect antibody binding and give no information on antibody functionality. The MERS-CoV spike protein N terminal subunit (S1) contains 2 functional domains: the N-terminal domain (S1 A ), which binds sialic acid, the viral attachment factor; and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (S1 B ), which binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor (7, 8) . Antibodies against those 2 domains can block MERS-CoV infection (9) . Based on this fundamental knowledge, we developed 2 recombinant proteinbased functional assays.",

Almeida coined the term \"coronavirus,\" from the Latin corona (\"crown\"), because the glycoprotein spikes of these viruses created an image similar to a solar corona.Strains that infect humans generally cause mild symptoms. However, more recently, animal coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
