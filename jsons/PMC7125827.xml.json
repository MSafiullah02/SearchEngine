            "text": "In nanomedicine, DNA usually takes on the role of a therapeutic molecule. There has been extensive work to overcome the barriers encountered when delivering DNA to the cell nucleus [1], [2], [3], and the development of new materials that can serve as efficient nucleic acid-delivery vehicles is of key importance. In many of these systems, polymeric materials have been investigated due to their well-understood physical and chemical properties, biocompatibility and apparent increase in delivery efficiency [4]. At the nanoscale, methods for DNA delivery include condensation of DNA by forming complexes with cationic polymers and synthetic peptides [5], [6], lipid\u2013DNA complexes [7] and encapsulation within hydrogel nanoparticles [8]. At larger scales, sustained release of DNA complexes from a polymer matrix has also been reported [9]. It is important to note that, in each of these systems, as with many biomedical systems, the polymer takes on both a functional and structural role. DNA, although often regarded as a drug, is also a polymer that possesses many of the chemical and physical properties that make other polymers desirable for the same therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "There is no question about the importance of the DNA's role in molecular biology since its structure was discovered in the early 1950s. Perhaps it is somewhat unfortunate that, in spite of its polymeric characteristics, the term \u2018DNA\u2019 has become synonymous with \u2018genetics\u2019. However, within recent decades, DNA has gained significant recognition as an incredibly versatile \u2018generic\u2019 material. Due to its remarkable physical and chemical properties, DNA demonstrates great potential as a structural polymer for bottom-up nanoscale synthesis [10]. Mechanically, DNA is surprisingly robust \u2013 below its persistence length of \u223c 50 nm, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is a relatively rigid molecule [11]. It is also stable at huge aspect ratios and can extend to several hundred micrometres despite its diameter of only \u223c 2 nm. From a chemical perspective, DNA can be engineered and processed efficiently with angstrom-level accuracy using a plethora of biochemical techniques [12]. A unique inventory of thousands of biochemically characterised enzymes, unlike that of any other known natural or synthetic polymer, is also available for the precise manipulation of DNA [13]. In particular, enzymatic cleavage and ligation facilitates the processing of DNA into monodisperse strands with exact lengths and sequences. In single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), each of the four bases \u2013 adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C) \u2013 has a specific affinity to its complement (A/T and G/C). These bases act as side-chains that can be engineered in any order. Typically, ssDNA strands containing complementary base sequences can recognise and bind to each other to form a dsDNA duplex (hybridisation). In addition, ssDNA can also self-anneal to form unique tertiary structures that can bind specifically to macromolecules, rivalling the binding affinities of antibodies. Furthermore, the development of recombinant DNA technology and solid-phase synthesis techniques has facilitated the reliable mass production of DNA.",

            "text": "Although naturally occurring DNA is linear, the rational design of single-stranded oligomers has enabled the realisation of three polymer topologies that are relevant to nanomedicine, namely linear, branched and networked (cross-linked) [14]. Each of these topologies is typically associated with properties that could be adapted for specific applications, particularly within the realm of nanomedicine as outlined by Freitas [15], [16]. Linear DNA has traditionally been limited to the fields of genetics and drug delivery, but is being increasingly utilised in molecular recognition and diagnostic systems for its simplicity and distinct binding characteristics. Branched DNA encompasses an extensive library of unique structures that could be tailored individually or collectively for an assortment of potential applications. In particular, DNA dendrimers are unique for their multivalent termini that allow for signal amplification and high-affinity targeting. Finally, networked DNA architectures are structurally stable and provide a three-dimensional scaffold that could be tailored towards controlled-release systems as well as protein-production platforms for therapeutics. There are many excellent reviews that discuss DNA architectures in depth and emphasise their potential use in bottom-up nanoscale synthesis [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. This article focusses specifically on the application of DNA in nanomedicine. We describe DNA architectures in the context of the three polymer topologies and how their properties can be tailored towards particular applications (Fig. 1\nand Table 1\n).",

As early as 1996, Mirkin and co-workers described a method of assembling AuNPs into macroscopic aggregates using DNA as linkers through thiol bonds [32]. Subsequently, Mirkin's group employed DNA-modified AuNPs as a scaffold to develop a highly selective, colorimetric polynucleotide-detection technique [26], [33] (Fig. 2A). AuNPs aggregated in the presence of complementary target ssDNA in solution as a result of DNA hybridisation. The aggregation induced a red-to-purple colour change, which enabled the precise detection of as little as 10 femtomoles of the target sequence [34]. This colorimetric method was also demonstrated for the highly selective and sensitive detection of mercuric ions and cysteine in aqueous solution [35], [36]. Colorimetric biosensing is particularly promising since it eliminates the necessity of expensive and complicated instruments for detection [37].",

This \u2018antisense nanoparticle\u2019 was constructed by attaching multiple strands of antisense DNA to the surface of an AuNP. It was observed that the AuNP-immobilised antisense DNA became more stable and could bind to the target mRNA more effectively than the free antisense DNA strands. This technique possesses many advantages compared to antisense DNA complexed with commercial agents, such as LipofectamineTM and CytofectinTM; in particular, more effective gene knockdown, less susceptibility to degradation, lower toxicity and enhanced cellular absorption were noted for these AuNP\u2013DNA conjugates. Interestingly, the large number of proteins (from serum) that adsorbed onto the AuNP surface appeared to enhance cellular uptake of the negatively charged antisense nanoparticles [31]. In addition, a higher surface density of oligonucleotides bound more proteins, which ultimately increased the uptake efficiency.",

For example, a molecular ruler created by tethering double-stranded DNA to a single AuNP enabled label-free and real-time measurements of protein-DNA interactions at an extremely high resolution [51]. Storhoff developed a \u2018spot-and-read\u2019 colorimetric detection method for detecting zeptomole quantities of a nucleic acid target without any target or signal amplification [52]. More recently, Qin and co-workers reported a novel AuNP-based quantitative DNA assay with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discrimination selectivity [53]. The precise quantification is due to the formation of defined DNA\u2013AuNP conjugate groupings in the presence of target/linker DNA, which were then characterised and quantified by gel electrophoresis. Niemeyer and co-workers have also utilised linear DNA as an intermediate linker for generating protein\u2013nanoparticle conjugates that are ideal for immunological diagnostics [54], [55]. Niemeyer's group also demonstrated binding and dissociation of proteins from the surfaces of DNA\u2013nanoparticle conjugates under physiological conditions, which ensures that the biological activity of the protein is not compromised [56]. In addition to metallic nanoparticle-based systems, quantum dots (QDs) conjugated to ssDNA have also been used for ultra-sensitive detection of DNA in a separation-free format [57]. Alivisatos and co-workers also reported that DNA\u2013QD conjugates, when used in conjunction with microarrays, enabled the rapid detection of SNPs and single-base deletions [58].",

Over the past 17 years, aptamers have been generated against a wide array of molecular targets, including many known proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides and other small molecules, as well as highly complex structures such as viruses [64], [65], [66]. Aptamers are typically 15\u201340 nucleotides in length [60] and are generally produced through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process [62], [67], an iterative, in vitro evolutionary process based on identification of a tight binding sequence followed by amplification.",

            "text": "Aptamers behave like drugs, analogous to monoclonal antibodies that function through high-affinity binding to a target molecule [68], distinguishing them from antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes [69]. With their high specificity and strong affinity for their targets, aptamers are very powerful tools for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [64], [65], [66], [70]. They are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide variety of human maladies, including infectious diseases, cancer and cardiovascular disease [71]. As a result, there has been much interest in developing aptamers for cancer therapy [72], [73], [74], [75], [76]. The most advanced aptamer and the first to enter clinical trials is AS1411 [77], a 26-mer unmodified guanosine-rich oligonucleotide that has been shown to be effective against human tumour xenografts in vivo. Aptamers have also been conjugated to QDs and used in conjunction with DNA-intercalating drugs for the simultaneous targeting, imaging and treatment of cancer [75], [76]. This approach proved to be highly effective in targeting cancer cells and decreasing tumour size with fewer side effects on healthy cells in comparison to current methods of chemotherapy.",

Currently, most diagnostic applications of aptamers rely on ligand-induced conformational changes, which can be detected by the corresponding changes of these signals [65]. Such applications include western blot analyses, oligonucleotide-precipitation assays, flow-cytometry and use as affinity reagents coupled to solid matrices for protein purification [66], [78]. Aptamers have also been successfully utilised in a procedure similar to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombin [80]. In addition, fluorescence-labelled aptamers have also been used to quantify immunoglobulin E (IgE) and thrombin based on capillary electrophoresis/laser-induced fluorescence (CE/LIF), in which detection as low as 50 pM was reported [81]. A cell-based aptamer-selection method to generate aptamers that can specifically recognise target cancer cells has also been reported [82], [83], [84]. This method shows great promise for developing specific molecular probes for cancer diagnosis and cancer biomarker discovery. In addition to the diagnostic and therapeutic applications, aptamers have also been frequently used for target validation and drug discovery [65], [70], [85], [86].",

In the most basic description, a hydrogel is a water-swollen, cross-linked polymer network in which water accounts for most of the structure's mass. The degree of swelling is mediated by a balance of the force associated with solvent mixing with the retractive force of the polymer chains, and is dependent on the amount of cross-linking and the solvent conditions [88], [89], [90]. \u2018Smart\u2019 hydrogels can be designed to respond to environmental stimuli, such as chemicals, temperature, pH, electrical signals and light [91], which has stirred much interest in their use as biomaterials [92]. Consequently, a variety of applications have been demonstrated with environmentally responsive hydrogels, including chemical sensors [93], microfluidic actuators [94], microlenses [95], [96] and controlled-drug-release systems [97], [98], [99]. The incorporation of DNA into hydrogels has also led to novel systems that exhibit a bulk response triggered by the presence of target ssDNA [100], [101], [102], [103].",

Langrana and co-workers have used grafted ssDNA as a means to control the cross-linking of polyacrylamide [100], [101]. Two different sequences (SA1 and SA2) were modified with Acrydite (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) at their 5\u2032 ends and co-polymerised separately with acrylamide. A target sequence, L2, was designed to be partially complementary to SA1 and SA2. When L2 was added to the mixture of the polymer batches, it was able to cross-link adjacent SA1 and SA2 polymer chains. It was found that gelation occurs above a critical target concentration of L2. Furthermore, addition of a removal strand, R1, that could hybridise completely with L2 was shown to disrupt the cross-linking and return the gel to a liquid state, demonstrating reversible transitions that do not require heating or chemical species that break covalent bonds (Fig. 2C).",

Holliday junctions are unstable due to the internal sequence symmetry that allows for migration of the branch point during genetic recombination [10]. By designing oligonucleotides with partial complementary sequences and specific sequence-symmetry constraints, Seeman's group assembled the first synthetic four-armed DNA junction [104]. This seminal work has inspired an assortment of novel branched DNA architectures, including various DNA shapes (cubes, octahedrons, hexagons, etc [105], [106], [107].), DNA catenanes and knots [108] and multi-armed branched DNA structures [109], [110], [111]. Early branched DNA junctions, however, suffered from high conformational flexibility, preventing the formation of regular superstructures made from DNA junctions. As a solution, Seeman and co-workers developed more rigid motifs based on the concept of crossover hybridisation. Here, two or three helices of DNA were connected by cross-allocation of one or more strands, resulting in double-crossover (DX), triple-crossover DNA (TX) and paranemic crossover (PX) architectures [112], [113], [114]. Branched DNA molecules have also inspired the construction of more complex structures, such as DNA nanomachines [115].",

In collaboration with the Baird group, trivalent Y-DNA was used as a tool for assessing structural and spatial constraints in receptor-signal initiation [116]. In this study, trivalent Y-DNA functioned as rigid spacers between 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) groups that bind specifically to anti-DNP IgE on RBL mast cells. The Baird group found that cellular degranulation, tyrosine phosphorylation responses and calcium mobilisation were all affected by the length of the Y-DNA spacer used. These results are also a clear demonstration of how DNA can be useful in biology for structural, rather than genetic, purposes.",

In a synergistic fashion, the dyes, in turn, serve to stabilise the branched DNA structures from thermal denaturation.

We demonstrated that these stable and monodisperse DL-DNA structures could be produced through a robust and efficient assembly process for up to five dendrimer generations. To create these structures, the Y-DNA building blocks were designed to have non-palindromic cohesive ends to eliminate the occurrence of self-ligations and to ensure uni-directional ligations with each increasing generation. The multiple end termini of the DL-DNA can be attached to various ligands and molecules, and can easily be tailored to be either anisotropic for multivalent signalling or isotropic for signal amplification. These DL-DNA constructions are a clear example that novel functional nanostructures can be assembled with control and precision through the manipulation of DNA.",

The monomers consisted of colour combinations of QDs, photo-cross-linkable moieties and sticky ends for ligation to a target sequence. The sticky ends were designed to hybridise with pathogen DNA sequences, which resulted in the formation of dimers. Upon ultraviolet (UV) illumination, the dimers polymerised via their cross-linkable groups, forming spherical particles with unique fluorescent signals. Without the target DNA, polymerisation would not have occurred, making this a novel technique for \u2018target-driven\u2019 polymerisation (Fig. 3B).",

Electrostatically cross-linked DNA networks, on the other hand, rely on the interactions between the anionic phosphate groups of the DNA backbone with cationic materials, such as surfactants, metal ions, or other polymers [125], [126]. The early work of Amiya and Tanaka showed that covalent DNA gels, similarly to many other polyelectrolyte gels, undergo a discontinuous volume transition depending on the solvent conditions [123].

The hydrogel was able to protect the bacteria when submerged in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, while also providing conditions that were suitable for bacterial growth. Both the biocompatibility and bioactivity of DNA-based hybrid systems demonstrate its merit as a functional biomaterial. In addition to hydrogels, insoluble films have also been reported. One such film was formed through complexation of DNA with cationic metal ions [126]. The complexes were found to be stable and the metal ions remained functional, making these films particularly interesting as antibacterial and biosensing materials. DNA-alginate films have also been reported, in which the film was used as a filter to remove toxic materials upon intercalation with the DNA backbone [128]. In addition, the films were also used in a solid-phase assay as an antigen to detect an anti-DNA antibody [129].",

The sticky ends were then ligated to form a 3D hydrogel network. Without CpG repeats within the sequence of the DNA motifs, the DNA hydrogel is naturally biocompatible, biodegradable and non-immunogenic, making it a promising candidate for drug delivery and tissue engineering [139]. In particular, it was observed that two drugs, porcine insulin and Camptothecin, after encapsulation in the DNA hydrogel, could be released in a controlled manner over time. Live mammalian cells, such as Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells, could also be encapsulated in the gel and remain alive for up to 3 days later.",

This resulted in a DNA hydrogel with genes covalently linked within the matrix. With the addition of cell lysates, P-gel was able to produce proteins with higher yield and production efficiency (up to 300 times more efficient) than conventional cell-free protein-synthesis systems. Furthermore, P-gel was utilised to produce a variety of proteins, including reporter proteins, membrane proteins, kinases, protein hormones and toxic proteins, all with comparable efficiency and yield. The substantial improvement in protein production by P-gel was attributed to factors such as enhanced transcription, a higher surface-to-volume ratio and an improved protection against degradation of the gene. For these reasons, P-gel could be potentially used in high-throughput protein engineering or as an implantable on-site protein-expression system in the future.",

A fundamental requirement of nanoscale building materials is that they must be structurally durable, nontoxic and biochemically stable [153]. However, the issue of DNA immunogenicity in humans still remains controversial. Although ssDNA were reported to elicit antibodies, dsDNA, such as plasmid DNA, has been reported to be only weakly immunogenic in humans [154], [155]. From a chemical stability perspective, natural DNA is prone to degradation in serum by endonucleases and exonucleases. In the case of DNA aptamers, a short serum circulation life in vivo results from both nuclease degradation and rapid renal clearance due to small molecular size (< 40 kDa). However, appropriate chemical modifications, such as methylation and pegylation, could provide protection from degradation and increase circulation time substantially. In general, the interactions between living cells and synthetic nanomaterials have yet to be fully understood. Hence, more empirical data is needed regarding the survival of DNA motifs in a cellular environment before such nanostructures could be applied in vivo.",

            "text": "Directed self-assembly of DNA subunits into functional nanostructures still remains a non-trivial task. The interactions between subunits are particularly important in the formation of more complex structures. For example, a delicate balance between stress and flexibility of individual subunits is necessary for the formation of 2D lattices [156]. In contrast with 2D DNA networks, which generally require high rigidity, flexibility within DNA motifs is favourable for producing amorphous, isotropic 3D gels. However, the bulk behaviour of DNA networks that comprise of monomeric subunits is difficult to predict. Nevertheless, numerical models for the self-assembly of branched and networked DNA structures could be helpful in the design process. One such study showed that gelation is highly dependent on temperature and diffusivity [157], indicating that it may be possible to optimise the conditions for which the macroscale transitions of DNA nanoarchitectures are controllable. A greater understanding of bulk behaviour of nanoscale subunits will be necessary for the development of more complex architectures in the future.",
