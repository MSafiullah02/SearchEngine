Since coronaviruses are very difficult to grow in cell culture, accurate and sensitive diagnoses are not feasible by this technique. To overcome the lack of sensitivity and to obtain rapid diagnostic results, more sensitive molecular methods for the detection of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been developed, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested RT-PCR, and recently real-time RT-PCR (1). Nevertheless, HCoVs are not often diagnosed in clinical laboratories, although the SARS epidemic and the identification of HCoV-NL63 drew attention to the clinical relevance of HCoVs. Multiplex RT-PCRs for the detection of common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens have now been supplemented with primer pairs for amplification of HCoV-OC43, 229E, and NL63 (2,3).",

However, the recent identification of HCoV-NL63 demonstrated that this novel coronavirus could not be amplified by the consensus RT-PCR described by Stephensen and colleagues, which might be explained by the presence of several mismatches in the primer sequences. We designed a novel pancoronavirus RT-PCR in which we modified the coronavirus consensus RT-PCR primers based on an alignment of the HCoV-NL63 sequence and the corresponding sequences of 13 other coronaviruses. Theoretically, this pancoronavirus RT-PCR should amplify a 251-bp fragment of the polymerase gene of all coronaviruses known at present, and we tested this experimentally for the five known human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and SARS-CoV) and three animal coronaviruses (PHEV, FIPV, and MHV). The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR was found to be lower than for a nondegenerate RT-PCR, which can be explained by the high level of degeneracy of the pancoronavirus primers. Nevertheless, this pancoronavirus assay is a useful tool for screening sample collections for the presence of all known and potentially yet unknown coronaviruses (5).\n",

It can be difficult to completely liquefy the sputum sample, so the filter may become blocked. In this case, the only solution is to use another filter.Especially during RNA extraction, the likelihood of cross-contamination is high. When performing the RNA extraction manually, one should change tips in between samples, as well as when adding wash buffer to the samples. Another precautionary measure that can be taken is to use tissue paper when opening the samples to avoid the formation of aerosols.For modification of the coronavirus consensus RT-PCR primers (4), an alignment of the polymerase gene sequences of 14 known coronaviruses was made (Fig.\n1). Degenerate Cor-FW and Cor-RV primers were developed. The coordinates of Cor-FW and Cor-RV are 14017 and 14248, respectively, in the HCoV-NL63 complete genome sequence. The 14 coronavirus sequences used here are available from GenBank under the following accession numbers: HCoV-NL63, AY567487; HCoV-229E, AF304460; PEDV, AF353511; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), AF304460; feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), AF124987; HCoV-OC43, AY391777; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), AF124988; bovine coronavirus (BCoV), AF391541; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), X51939; sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), AF124990; canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV), AY150273; SARS-CoV, AY313906; turkey coronavirus (TCoV), AF124991; and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Z30541.The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA. Primer concentrations were increased up to 4 \u03bcM per reaction to improve the sensitivity of the assay. While 50 copies of HCoV-OC43 RNA copies per microliter sample could be detected, the sensitivity for HCoV-NL63 was slightly lower, i.e., 5 \u00d7 103 RNA copies per microliter sample.An important precautionary measure when performing RT-PCR is to avoid RNase contamination. Therefore, all materials should be RNase-free, and gloves and a gown should be worn even when preparing the (noninfectious) master mix. In addition, an RNase inhibitor (RNase OUT, Invitrogen Life Technologies; 20 units per reaction) can be added to the RT-PCR reaction to inhibit degradation of the RNA sample owing to RNases. This measure should be taken especially when a positive control RNA sample no longer amplifies.Include negative as well as positive controls in each RT-PCR. A negative control consists of a sample containing only the master mix without RNA (10 \u03bcl of water is added instead of RNA). As a positive control, RNA of a human coronavirus (e.g., HCoV-OC43) can be used.When adding the RNA samples to the master mix, precaution must be taken to avoid RNA contamination. Such a precautionary measure is opening the tubes with tissue paper, thereby avoiding the formation of aerosols, as the latter could lead to cross-sample contamination.It is advised to load the Molecular Weight Marker on both sides of the gel, as a gel can show the phenomenon of \u201csmiling,\u201d which makes the determination of the fragment size difficult when the MWM is only present on one side of the gel.Use two pairs of gloves when handling ethidium bromide, as this intercalating agent is highly mutagenic.Amplification of a 251-bp fragment of the coronavirus polymerase gene was demonstrated for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, PHEV, FIPV, and MHV-A59 (Fig.\n3) and for HCoV-HKU1 (data not shown).\n\nThe DNA pellet is often not visible. Therefore, during centrifugation the tubes are always put in the same orientation in the centrifuge, so that one knows at which side of the tube the pellet is located. The aspiration of supernatant should be performed carefully without touching the pellet.The polymerase gene is a very conserved region in the coronavirus genome. Therefore, the percentage sequence similarity will be high among different coronavirus members belonging to the same group. Nevertheless, this sequence information allows a primary identification of the coronavirus type that is present in a sample.The genetic and evolutionary relatedness to known coronaviruses can be determined from the phylogenetic tree clustering pattern of the coronavirus sequence fragment, amplified from a sample. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes that are connected by branches. The external nodes represent the existing organisms or taxa, while the internal nodes represent the (hypothetical) ancestors of the existing taxa. The length of the horizontal branches is indicative of the evolutionary distance between the connected nodes, whereas the vertical branches are noninformative. Taxa that are present in the same cluster are monophyletic, which indicates that they show a (relatively) close genetic relatedness.\n",
