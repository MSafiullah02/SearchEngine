The prototype is the illness known as the common cold. Patients with an URI develop sore throat, fever, and hoarseness, making what would be an inconvenience to most individuals, potentially crippling for the vocal arts performer.1 Even minor URI-related symptoms can lead to alterations in voice quality, vocal fatigue, and reduced vocal range.2 Moreover, the laryngeal inflammation resulting from an URI can predispose singers to mucosal disruption and hemorrhage\u2014resulting in long-term, potentially disastrous, sequelae for the vocal professional.3 Viruses cause most URIs, with rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza virus accounting for most cases. Adults develop, on average, two to four URIs per year, with most occurring during the winter months.4 Compared to URIs caused by other viruses, influenza, is a more systemic illness, with the upper respiratory tract being only one of multiple organ systems involved. It should be recognized as distinct from other causes of URI.",

One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often and this is enough to trigger the outbreak. Another is that the cold weakens the immune system; however, the virus is contracted in a warm indoor environment in which it can thrive.",

            "text": "Zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are members of a new class of drugs termed neuraminidase inhibitors, which are active against both influenza virus type A and type B. These agents work by blocking the neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of the influenza virus (neuramidase facilitates the virus' spread from cell to cell in the respiratory tract).14 Zanamivir, as a dry powder is administered by inhalation twice a day for 5 days from a breath-activated device. Oseltamivir is available in pill form and is active against the A strain of the influenza virus, but has only minimal activity against the B strain. Clinical trials have shown that both agents need to be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to impact the course of disease.15 Oseltamivir, but not zanamivir, is also approved for the prevention of influenza.16 In a pooled analysis of two seasonal prophylaxis studies in healthy unvaccinated adults and adolescents, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily taken for 42 days during a community outbreak reduced the incidence of laboratory confirmed clinical influenza from 4.8% for the placebo group to 1.2%.16 In a seasonal prevention study in elderly residents of nursing homes, 75 mg of oseltamivir taken once a day for 42 days reduced the incidence of laboratory confirmed clinical influenza from 4.4% for the placebo group to 0.4% for the oseltamivir group.17 Approximately 80% of this elderly population was vaccinated against the influenza. In a study of postexposure prevention in households, 75 mg of oseltamivir was given once daily within 2 days of onset of symptoms and continued for 7 days. Results of this study show oseltamivir reduced the incidence of laboratory confirmed clinical influenza from 12% in the placebo group to 1% in the oseltamivir group.18 Side effects from oseltamivir, when taken for prevention, were similar to those from patients who took the drug for treatment. The most common side effects were nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. Efficacy of oseltamivir for the prevention of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients. Patients should continue receiving an annual influenza vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Oseltamivir is not a substitute for the influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "The major public health measure for prevention of influenza has been the use of inactivated influenza vaccines from influenza strains that circulated during the previous season. When the vaccine virus matches the previous years' circulating strain well, immunization can provide from 60% to 90% protection against influenza.19 Current vaccine formulations are highly purified and associated with few reactions. Up to 5% of individuals experience mild fevers and systemic symptoms 8\u201324 hours after injection, and a third of recipients will experience tenderness and erythema at the injection site. A live attenuated influenza A vaccine (FluMist; MedImmune Vaccines, Gaithersburg, MD) has also been developed, which is administered intranasally and stimulates local antibody production more efficiently than conventional inactivated vaccines.20 One placebo-controlled study in 103 experimentally infected adults found that the protective efficacy of FluMist was 85%, compared to 71% with inactivated influenza vaccine.21 Vaccination, by either method, becomes effective 10\u201314 days after administration. Because the live attenuated vaccine depends on the replication of the vaccine recipient in the nasopharynx, antiviral drugs for influenza should not be started for 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine.22, 23, 24 The most common side effects include cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, irritability, headaches, chills, muscle aches, and fever >100\u00b0 F. For adults, nasal congestion (9.2% FluMist vs 2.2% placebo), rhinitis (6.3% FluMist vs 3.1% placebo), and sinusitis (4.1% FluMist vs 2.2% placebo) were reported significantly more often by FluMist recipients compared to placebo recipients.25 Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, headache, irritability, decreased activity, muscle ache, and cough are the most common adverse events associated with the vaccine. Of note, FluMist is contraindicated in adolescents receiving aspirin therapy or aspirin-containing therapy because of the association of Reye syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection. Also, FluMist should not be administered to individuals with a history of asthma or reactive airways disease. Intramuscularly administered inactivated influenza vaccines are available to immunize high-risk individuals.",

            "text": "Presented below is a summary, in outline form, of influenza treatment options available to professionals entrusted with the care of the professional voice. The listed treatments are organized according to the acuity of the need for intervention.1.Prophylaxis: As with other diseases, prevention is the most effective strategy for professional voice users. This can take the form of either chemoprevention or vaccination:a.Short-term chemoprevention is indicated under the following conditionsi.A 14-day course of prophylaxis should be considered for the 2-week interval following the immunization of performers when there is influenza activity in the community or performance troupe at the time of immunization.ii.A 10-day course of prophylaxis should be considered for all individuals in the performance troupe with known contact with an index case of influenza.\nb.An extended course of prophylaxis (to cover the entire period of significant influenza activity in the community) should be considered in selected settings:i.Protection of singers for whom the vaccine is contraindicated (eg, singers with a history of anaphylactic reaction to eggs)ii.Protection of immunized high-risk singers if vaccine strain poorly matches circulating influenza strains\nChemoprophylaxis can be accomplished with amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir. Amantadine (200 mg/day orally in two divided doses, or 100 mg/day in those susceptible to CNS side effects) and rimantadine (200 mg/day in two divided doses) are effective only against influenza A. Oseltamivir (75 mg/day) and zanamivir (10 mg inhaled daily) are effective against influenza A and B. All the above medications will reduce the attack rate among unvaccinated individuals if begun shortly after exposure. Comparative trials among the agents have not been done.c.Vaccination is indicated in performers expecting to work in a city where there is an influenza outbreak.Inactivated influenza vaccine can be concurrently administered if the singer is expected to reside in the influenza affected for more than 2 weeks. Live attenuated vaccination cannot, however, be coadministered with a chemoprophylaxis regimen since limited viral replication is necessary for this vaccination modality to be effective.\n\n2.Acute treatment:a.In most healthy people, influenza is cured in 7\u201310 days. The worst symptoms usually last 3\u20134 days. Affected singers without imminent important performances may prefer to rest, with only light voice use. Analgesics and a cough mixture may be used. Home treatment to ease symptoms and prevent complications is usually all that is needed.b.For the singer with performance requirements, antiviral medications, when started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, can be taken to:i.Reduce the severity and duration of symptoms caused by infection with influenza A or B virus.ii.Shorten the length of the illness.iii.Control outbreaks of the flu in the performance troupe.iv.Reduce complications from the flu.Amantadine or rimantadine, in the same doses as used for prophylaxis, appreciably decrease the duration of symptoms and signs. Rimantadine is preferred in patients with renal failure.\nc.Theoretically, corticosteroids as potent anti-inflammatory agents could be thought to effectively reduce nasal symptoms, but results of clinical studies of either intranasal or oral steroids have shown no clinical benefit.26, 27, 28\n\n\n",

This review has highlighted a number of interventions currently at the disposal of those charged with the care of the professional voice. Judicious use of preventative and therapeutic modalities, combined with careful follow-up will optimize vocal performance and, more importantly, prevent serious injury to the vocal mechanism. In future, continued improvements and refinements in the capacity to design effective vaccines combined with new, structure-based, drug design techniques will yield increasingly effective interventions. Until then, voice-preserving strategies must include timely vaccination combined with education of the vocal arts professional on how to recognize the early signs and symptoms of influenza so as to allow for the earliest possible initiation of antiviral therapy.",
