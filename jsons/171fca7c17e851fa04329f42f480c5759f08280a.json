Although succession was essentially continuous, 5 faunal groups are suggested, based on time of appearance and duration of active forms in the pond. Some species were found during virtually the entire aquatic phase, while others completed their life cycles in only 2-3 weeks. Analysis of growth rates revealed many different patterns between species and groups. Analysis of community structure in terms of trophic status indicated shifts which coincided with the seasonal occurrence of the pond's potential food resources. Comparison of this fauna with that of a similar pond on Vancouver Island, British Columbia (some 2,400 km t o the west) showed many similarities in niche occupancy, including 6 species in common. The biological characteristics leading to the success of these cosmopolitan species in t.eniporary aquatic habitats is discussed.",

It has a niaxiniuin diameter of 30 in and a depth of 80 cni just after snow-melt in mid April, and usually dries up by midJuly. In exceptionally wet years it may contain a little water for a few days in the fall but essentially it experiences 9 consecutive months of drough annually. It therefore falls under the definition of a temporary vernal pool (WIGGINS, 1973). On two adjacent sides it is flanked by a gravel road but otherwise is heavily vegetated (Pig. 1). Cattails (Typha latifolia L.) grow across much of the pond bottom and redstemmed dogwood (Corwus sp.), pussy willows (Salix discolor MUHL.) and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) all have their roots in the water. The pond bottom consists of a layer of decaying plant material (mostly Typha L.) several centimeters thick through which grow patches of terrestrial weed species. Clumps of filamentous algae develop in late spring. Throughout the suniiiier, a dense canopy of herbaceous perennials covers the bed resulting in a reasonably moist substrate without standing water. Under winter snow cover, the substrate freezes solid.",

The pond had been kept nnder preliminary surveillance for 3 years prior t o t,his, during which time the composition of t h e animal community, as a u hole, changed little. During the wet phase a 53 pm mesh dip-net was used to sample both the water column and the bottom in shallow and deep water. I n addition, the undersides of submerged leaves, bark and branches were examined for more cryptic forms, and any adult insects flying over the pond were sampled with a sweep-net. On each occasion sampling effort was kept constant so as to allow a semi-quantitative analysis of the fauna to be made. More quantitative samplers were not used because of the problems of diversity of microhabitat, patchiness of animals and small population size of certain species, inherent in small ponds. During the dry phase, bottom samples were dug u p to a depth of 30 cm. Care was taken, throughout, not to remove too many animals in order not to alter the community balance. All samples were preserved in either alcohol or formalin and later sorted and the animals identified and measured (to determine growth rates) in the laboratory.",

The resulting eggs hatched quickly and the larvae grew rapidly in early June, passing into their second instar. Thereafter, growth slowed and the summer dry period was passed as early instars that could be recovered from the pond substrate.

The percentage composition of the 4 main categories is shown in Figures   5B and C The percentage of suspension-feeders generally declined throughout the aquatic phase, correlating with decreasing pond diameter, and hence water volume (r=0.806). The few suspension-feeding taxa present in the bottom mud of the dry phase were obviously non-functional. At spring thaw, the detritivore-herbivores predominated. Many were found t o be eating the decaying plant material left over from the terrestrial phase. Numbers of species in this category fluctuated throughout the aquatic phase. Although they dropped during the dry phase, they increased in importance in terms of percentage coinposition of the coinmunityreflecting the movement of species into the drying basin to feed on decaying vegetation. The relative importance of omnivorous scavengers also increased at this time for similar reasons. The percentage of predatory taxa was relatively low at spring thaw but increased rapidly thereafter, primarily due to the immigration of species capable of flight-particularly aquatic beetles, and remained high for most of the aquatic phase.

(19SO) , on the basis of an extensive study of temporary pools in southern Ontario, divided the typical fauna into four groups depending on each species' strategy for tolerating or avoiding drought and on period of recruitment to the community, and WILLIAMS and HYHES (1976) made a similar analysis of the faunas of temporary streams in Ontario. Such functional analyses reveal much about the adaptations of temporary water species and make discussion of this topic here largely unnecessary. However, subdivision based on the combination of tolerance strategy (physiological response) with period of recruitment (temporal response), as in the WIGGINS et al. model, would seem t o be a somewhat confusing classification. For example, we see aestivation taking place primarily in the egg or immature stage in species from 3 of the 4 groups designated. Again, the groupings \"Overwintering residents\", \"Overwintering spring recruits'' and \"Overwintering summer recruits\" all contain species which are permanent residents of temporary ponds and whose active phases in these habitats often coincide.",

Temporal shifts in the trophic makeup of the community seem t o coincide well with the seasonal occurrence of the pond's potential food resources. The faunas of Sunfish and Page's ponds are remarkably similar considering that they are separated by a large distance, a mountain range and salt water. It is evident that they provide very similar niches which, in the case of cosmopolitan, readilydisseminated forms such as Daphnia pulex LEYDIG, are filled by identical species. I n cases where the geographical range of a species does not encompass the two ponds, local endemic species of the same major taxon fill the gap, as in the case of the anostracans -Chirocephalopm3 bundyi (FORBES) in Sunfish and Eubranchipus oregonus CREASER in Page's Pond.",

Such plasticity, coupled with a drought-resistant ephippial stage and parthenogenesis, must favour establishment in temporary ponds. Canthocarnptus staphylinoides PEARSE is recorded as widespread in southern parts of Canada and the central United States (BORUTSKII, 1964) . It is capable of encystment and can survive long periods in anoxic sediments where it is thought t o respire anaerobically (COLE 1953). Presumably, this would stand it in good stead in temporary waters, particularly as a very closely related species, C . s. staphylinus, is capable of withstanding drought. C. staphylinoides is thought t o replace C . s. staphylinus in North America, the latter being widespread in the Palearct ic ( BORUTSKII, 1964) . Acanthocyclops vernalis FISCHER shows considerable environmental t olerance, sexually mature specimens having been found, for example, at temperatures of 1-30\"C and in p H of 4.4-8.2. It is found in a large variety of water bodies, from the deep sublittoral of large lakes t o swamps. It is capable of aestivating in an advanced state of metamorphosis and as such can survive drying (RYLOV, 1963). Cypria ophthalmica (JURINE) occurs primarily in the mixedwoods and boreal forest zones (DELORME, 1970), particularly in ponds rich in decaying material (TRESSLER, 1959) .

As the pondwater evaporated, temperature and conductivit y rose while p H varied. 98 taxa were identified which showed seasonal succession over the annual cycle of the pond. Bive recognizably distinct faunal groups, based on time of appearance and period of activity, were apparent. Group 1 animals were found during the entire aquatic phase. Group 2 animals were active within days of the pond filling in the spring and completed their life cycles within 4-6 weeks. Group 3 animals appeared 2-5 weeks after filling and typically took 5 weeks t o mature. Species in Group 4 were evident only 2-3 week before the pond dried up and exhibited rapid growth. Group 5 animals appeared in the dry phase and included primarily terrestrial and riparian species. Community composition is analyzed in terms of trophic status of each taxon. This indicates shifts which were appropriate for seasonal changes in the pond's potential food resources. The taxonomic composition of the spring-time fauna of this pond is compared with that of a very similar pond 2,400 km to the west, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The number of species in each major taxon was frequently identical in the two ponds. I n addition, the faunas had 23 genera and 6 species in common. These two faunas are compared with a predictive model of the faunal compliment of annual temporary pools proposed by WIGGINS et al. (1980) and good agreements are found. Adaptation of some cosmopolitan species t o life in temporary ponds are discussed.",

L i~n e p h i l u s indivisus WALKER belongs t o a genus widely distributed in the Nearctic ( WIGGINS, 1977). Its success in temporary habitats may be due to several features in its development, namely, the deposition of eggs in a gelatinous matrix in sheltered areas of the dry pond basin, rapid embryological development and retention of first instar larvae within the matrix until the pond is flooded (WIGGINS, 1973). The actual mechanism of transcontinental moveinent of these species varies. A t various times since the last glaciation, some aquatic insect groups are thought t o have emigrated westwards from the St. Lawrence system through drainage connections (ROSS, 1956; FLANNAGAN, 1978) but flight may also be important. This may also have been the method employed by mites in their parasitic phase on airborne hosts. The resting stages of micro-crustaceans may be light enough t o be carried by air currents. MAGUIRE (1963), for example, found this route t o be very effective in the transport of disseminules of some small species of Cladocera, and FRYER (1972) has shown that some ephippia are easily picked up by wind. I n terms of the WIGGINS et al. prediction of the faunal compliment of annual temporary pools, Sunfish Pond agrees well, with 69.9 \"'\" of its fauna, at the generic level (48 out of a possible total of 69 genera) appearing in their list. For Page's Pond the agreement at the generic level is also good, being 68.8 \",' (, (22 out of a possible 32 identified taxa). These figures are however, only approximations and are subject t o inaccuracies due to incomplete identifications of some members of the communities and local endemism. Unfortunately, no study exists on temporary ponds in eastern maritime regions of the continent thus limiting this comparison. However, based on the present study, the provisional list of genera representing the temporary pool community in north-eastern North America outlined by WIGGINS and his co-workers seems t o have widespread predictive value.",
