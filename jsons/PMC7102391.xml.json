All patients with clinical stage II or III [23] esophageal cancer who had undergone esophagectomy between June 1995 and July 2011 were selected. Individual patient, operative, and postoperative variables (see the Appendix) were extracted and used for subsequent analysis of outcomes. In addition to registry data, each patient\u2019s clinical record was reviewed to obtain any additional variables that were necessary for generation of the Charlson weighted index of comorbidity, commonly referred to as the CCI [19]. All patients with premalignant, local (stage I), and distant (stage IV) esophageal cancer were excluded from the study. Early-stage disease was treated with endoscopic resection or laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy, while stage IV disease was predominantly treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy with or without palliative esophageal stenting.",

Recently, PET-CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis has been introduced into our practice and patients imaged at our institution usually undergo this in lieu of conventional PET. Based on the results of preoperative studies, those with clinical stage II or III esophageal carcinoma were offered neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy 4\u20136 weeks after completing induction therapy. The standard chemotherapy regiment, used for most patients, consisted of a platin-based (cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin) therapy and 5-fluorouracil or taxane-based (paclitaxel or docetaxel) therapy in conjunction with a platin derivative given over 5\u20136 weeks. Radiotherapy was delivered to the tumor and regional nodes as a total dose of 45 Gy given in 1.8-Gy daily fractions. This was followed by a final boost dose to the tumor bed for a total treatment dose of 50.4\u201354 Gy. Patients were observed in the intensive care unit postoperatively until clinically appropriate for ward care. Subcutaneous heparin therapy was initiated on postoperative day 1. Beta-blocker therapy has been used postoperatively at our institution for arrhythmia prophylaxis in all patients without contraindications to its administration. In addition, since 2010, we have also added amiodarone to our immediate postoperative pathway in response to data suggesting it was beneficial to esophagectomy patients [24].",

Over the last 25 years, this instrument has been validated and applied as a metric for comorbidity across a wide range of studies that have investigated numerous disease processes and malignancies. In its original form, 19 conditions were found to have a significant influence on survival and each was assigned a relative risk for mortality after 1 year of follow-up. A weighted score was then assigned based on the adjusted relative risk of mortality to derive the final weighted index of comorbidity. The sum of the weighted scores of all of the comorbid conditions present in these patients was then reported as the overall CCI score. The comorbidity index was subsequently validated in a historical cohort of 685 breast cancer patients followed for up to 10 years. The method was also validated against the method of staging comorbidity developed by Kaplan and Feinstein [25] and was found equivalent with virtually identical variance.",

Another important finding in their study was that the detrimental effect of advanced CCI stages on survival remained significant after adjusting for confounding variables such as tumor stage and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The overall relative risk for cancer-related death was 2.35 times greater for patients with advanced comorbidity than for those with low-grade comorbidity.",

In each case, there was good evidence that preexisting comorbidities, or morbid conditions resulting from the presence of the malignancy, do have a significant influence on treatment outcomes and overall survival in comparison to patients who are in better overall health. This has led to the interesting observation that patients with comorbid conditions and early-stage tumors have similar or poorer overall survival compared with patients who had no comorbid conditions and later-stage tumors [21]. It is well known that complications related to treatment or surgeries are more severe and frequent in patients with advanced comorbidity and our data support this observation.",

            "text": "In our cohort, major postoperative complications, of all types, occurred with equal frequency in open and MIE patients (Table 4). The frequency of complications in this series differs little from that in the published literature [4, 6\u201312, 27\u201329]. In the only randomized controlled trial to date that evaluated Open versus MIE [29], the pulmonary infection rate was 34 %, which is considerably more than that seen in this study. In a previous report, our group found a 34 % complication rate in MIE patients and 27 % in open cases [30]. It is interesting to note that only 5 % of patients in the Open group and 4 % in the MIE group had a CCI-G of 3 (advanced) while 50 % of the Open group and 65 % of the MIE group were graded as having low-grade or intermediate morbidity (Table 1). The low frequency of advanced Charlson grades in our study cohort may reflect selection bias. Individuals with advanced-grade morbidities are usually either not referred for surgery or are declined surgery due to a \u201chigh\u201d risk of complications or death. The second observation suggests that even patients with no or low comorbidity scores (CCI-G 0, CCI-G 1) are at risk for major complications after either open or laparoscopic esophagectomy. It appears that only CGI-G 3 is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications (OR 10.1; 95 % CI, 1.36\u2013209.04, p = 0.048) and anastomotic leak (OR 8.9; 95 % CI, 1.20\u201370.90, p = 0.03). We have also noted that our patients with a higher CCI-G (CCI >5) are more prone to have hemodynamic instability during the procedure and this adds to operative time while it is treated. Obesity also adds to the length of the procedure. Our mortality rate of 2 % in the MIE group and 5 % in the Open group is in keeping with the rates published by others [6, 7, 31].",

Individuals with CCI-G 3 morbidity, in comparison to those with CCI-G 0 morbidity, were over three times more likely to die under the same constraints, but this association fell just outside the level of significance (p = 0.056, Table 5). CCI-G 2 patients appear to represent a watershed in our cohort. Overall, these individuals appear to define a distinct group of patients that are positioned between the lower and upper grades. Unfortunately, our sample size for this group makes further analysis of this subset of patients extremely difficult.",

            "text": "While our findings related to comorbidity and survival after esophagectomy for cancer are the primary contributions of this work, we have also confirmed the safety and oncological equivalence of MIE in comparison to the open approach. Like others, we have found that MIE is associated with less operative blood loss [8, 12, 29, 33], a higher lymph node harvest [12, 13, 33], shorter LOS [9], and equivalent short- and long-term survival rates [9, 12, 13]. However, there was a noted difference in our surgical approach between the two groups. The majority of our MIE patients underwent a three-field approach while the majority of our Open patients had a conventional Lewis operation (Table 3). This reflects a trend in our clinical practice over the last decade of performing more MIEs instead of open procedures. A three-field technique is our procedure of choice, but we use a laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for small distal tumors and where single-lung ventilation may be poorly tolerated. Prior laparotomy or prior right thoracotomy influences our decision to perform an open or hybrid operation. Morbid obesity, where there is no favorable neck anatomy for dissection, and cancers that extend into the fundus, where we may not be able to fashion a gastric conduit of sufficient length to reach to the neck, also influence our decision to perform a chest anastomosis. We preferentially perform neck anastomoses because leaks and stenoses are more easily managed in this configuration. Despite the difference in these operative proportions, our complications, mortality, and outcomes have remained equivalent. The one exception is the rate of RLN injury during MIE, which was 7 % in this series and continues to highlight the risks associated with the cervical dissection. RLN injury in this series is half of what we previously reported [30] as experience with neck dissection and development of a consistent approach and operative team has reduced nerve injury rates to close to zero. Currently, during dissection, we do not use any unipolar electrocautery deep to the strap muscles. We use bipolar cautery sparingly on small vessels, and the middle thyroid vessels are dissected carefully and taken sharply after suture ligation. Beyond this, only careful blunt or sharp dissection is performed. Even at 7 %, our RLN injury rate is lower than the 12.7 % reported by others from a pooled analysis of 28 comparative studies [9].",

The disparity is a result of the increased use of neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery that has occurred over the past decade coupled with our practice of performing more MIEs instead of open procedures. In this study, the use of neoadjuvant therapy did not lead to higher morbidity or mortality in the MIE group and this is consistent with the current literature [34]. In our multivariate model, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy had no significant effect on overall survival or on any of the other outcome variables, but this finding runs counter to that of several recent RCTs. Some have attributed increased node harvesting and fewer positive nodes to the use of neoadjuvant therapy. While our study shows a difference in node harvest favoring MIEs, there is no significant difference in the median number of positive nodes between our two groups (p = 0.84). Likewise, in a recent systematic review comparing MIE to open esophagectomy [13], the authors report disparate lymph node retrieval data from across 17 comparative studies. In their analysis, however, the predominance of data does appear to favor MIE.",

Recently, we reported that diabetes and dyspnea were major risk factors for mortality after esophagectomy based on the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) data [35]. Taken together, these findings have led us to aggressively treat or optimize these conditions preoperatively. We correct malnutrition and significant peripheral vascular disease and also optimize pulmonary function by exercise, smoking cessation, and bronchodilators. Cardiac status is optimized by controlling blood pressure, treating congestive disease, and assuring indicated \u03b2-blocker or diuretic use. In addition, diabetes is aggressively managed.",

Our current staging system, increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy, and multidisciplinary team approach to treating cancer was not available in the latter part of the 1990s which may contribute to differences in some patients in our Open group. Despite this, many of our outcomes are in agreement with the findings of the only randomized controlled trial currently available that compares Open to MIE [29]. Overall survival should also be interpreted with caution. Our Open group has had a longer follow-up period than our MIE group and it will take ongoing review of our data to determine if the MIE approach improves long-term survival over the open approach. Our pathological complete responder rate is lower than expected. In the Open group, this might be attributed to the lower rate of use of neoadjuvant therapy during the earlier treatment years. Overall, only 61 % of patients in this group received neoadjuvant therapy. In our MIE group, it is notable that only a small proportion of postoperative pathology specimens were available in our review of the registry. This loss of data may influence the reporting of accurate pathology response in this group. Finally, we did not analyze survival based on the histopathological types of cancer. Only 13 patients (16 %) had squamous cell histology in the MIE group and 8 (12 %) in the Open group (data not shown). This led us to conclude that a meaningful comparison would not be obtained with such small numbers.",
