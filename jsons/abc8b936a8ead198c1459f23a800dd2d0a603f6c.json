When a stop codon (UAA 5731 ) was placed downstream of the major CP initiation codon (mutant GH1-7), neither CP was detectable after 24 h (Fig. 3 ) and gRNA accumulation was greatly reduced (Figs. 2 and 3). However, a trace amount of major CP was detectable after 40 h (Fig. 2) , possibly due to UAA suppression from this highly translated ORF (Lao et al., 2009) . With the stop codon (UAG 5599 ) placed upstream of the major CP initiation codon (mutant EF2-2), abundant major CP was produced without detectable minor CP (Fig. 3) . That the accumulation of gRNA and major CP was restored to near wild type levels in mutant EF2-2 suggests that the reduction of gRNA accumulation in mutant GH1-7 was linked to the absence of major CP expression. Mutant CD3-1 (UAA 5578 ) positions the stop codon upstream of both the candidate start codon for the minor CP as well as the start codon for the major CP and thus precludes translation of either CP as a part of the polyprotein; both a minor and major CP are produced by this mutant (not shown). Thus, complete translation of the entire polyprotein ORF is not an absolute requirement for the production of either CP species, and AUG 5581 is the probable initiation codon for the production of at least some fraction of the minor CP pool despite its close proximity to the 5 0 terminus of the sgRNA.

The underlying reason for the existence of multiple means of expression of the minor CP is not evident. While cleavage from the replicase polyprotein provides a source of minor CP, it may be that production of minor CP exclusively through this mechanism doesn 0 t provide stoichiometric amounts necessary for virion assembly. It is also possible that viruses such as OBDV are in an evolutionary transition toward CP production solely via sgRNAs and that readthrough of the larger replicase polyprotein is vestigial.

In all cases, putative initiator methionine residues for both minor and major CPs are evident. The putative initiator Met for the minor CP is 5-15 amino acids downstream of the highly conserved GELL motif that is encoded by the core sequence of the marafibox. With the exception of maize rayado fino virus (MRFV), switchgrass mosaic virus (SwMV), and Bermudagrass etched-line virus (BELV), a conserved motif comprised of LXGG is present 7-8 amino acids downstream of the initiator Met. Since this incorporates the demonstrated cleavage site that creates the amino terminus of the OBDV minor CP, it is reasonable to speculate that production of these other marafivirus minor CPs also involves cleavage at this site. A similar motif is present immediately upstream of the putative initiator Met in the polyproteins of MRFV, SwMV, and BELV. The SwMV sequence encodes an alanine at the putative cleavage site, but that is consistent with the previous observations of Kadar\u00e9 et al. (1995) and Sulea et al. (2006) , who noted the presence of G or A residues in the P1 and P2 positions of confirmed and predicted cleavage site sequences of tymo-and coronaviruses, respectively. Thus, we propose the consensus sequence at the predicted cleavage site associated with minor CP expression in marafiviruses is LXG[G/A]. Intriguingly, to counter cellular antiviral strategies that utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the protease of the closely-related TYMV cleaves ubiquitin conjugates from its RdRp at the same consensus sequence in addition to its role in polyprotein processing (Chenon et al., 2012) . Moreover, this consensus sequence is targeted by other viral cysteine proteases with both deubiquitinating and polyprotein processing activities (Barretto et al., 2005; Clementz et al., 2010; Karpe and Lole, 2011; Wang et al., 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1152, "end": 1172, "text": "Kadar\u00e9 et al.

For the latter, the predicted cleavage sites lie upstream of the predicted minor CP initiation codons, necessitating further studies to determine the precise CP expression strategies of these viruses. The location of the predicted cleavage site downstream from the initiator methionine of the minor CP would provide a consistent amino terminus for minor CP produced by cleavage of both the replicase polyprotein and a minor CP precursor translated directly from sgRNA. Irrespective of the role of protein cleavage in the formation of the minor CP N-terminus, an important function of the cleavage site may be to liberate the polymerase from the CP. The location of a putative protease cleavage site upstream of the initiator methionine for the minor CPs of SwMV, MRFV, and BELV is consistent with this view. Furthermore, the single CP of the closely-related but unclassified Poinsettia mosaic virus (PnMV) is fused to the PnMV replicase polyprotein, and the amino acid sequence between the marafibox and the CP also harbors a predicted LXGA cleavage site sequence (Fig. 5) . Thus, the LXG[G/A] motif is well conserved among viruses of the Tymoviridae that possess a replicase-CP fusion, regardless of the precise location of the motif relative to the CP translation initiation codon. This is the first investigation of a marafivirus CP expression strategy and a step toward a better understanding of overall gene expression in marafiviruses. The sequence conservation and similarity with other viruses that utilize papain-like proteases as a means to process polyproteins and defend against protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system suggests that similar mechanisms are used by marafiviruses.
