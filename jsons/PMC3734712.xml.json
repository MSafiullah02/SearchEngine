These primers amplify a 1.68 kb fragment of the rabies glycoprotein cDNA from the DNA rabies vaccine plasmid using applied Biosystems Gene Amp PCR system 2400 Thermocycler, USA. PCR mix contained 1 mg of tissue DNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 mg of each primer, 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore). Amplification conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min (1 cycle), 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 1 min (35 cycles), 94\u00b0C for 5 min (1 cycle), 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 7 min (1 cycle). PCR products were analyzed on 1 per cent agarose gels and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A 1.68 kb band indicated specific amplification of the rabies glycoprotein gene. Samples were scored as positive, if a 1.68 kb band was present. To determine the sensitivity of the PCR assay, different amount of rabies DNA vaccine plasmid were amplified as per conditions described above.",

Pre-clinical experiments have also demonstrated that extrapolating the data for clinical situation depends on species variation10. The predictions are 43 per cent with rodents and 63 per cent with non-rodents10. Therefore, the primary requirement in pre-clinical toxicology studies is the species and dose selection3. Selection of the species varies with nature of the compound under test. Weissnger16 has mentioned that the safety evaluation of biological products which include biotech manufactured substances need relevant species having relative affinity, distribution of receptors for the intended clinical product with appropriate immunological response. Chapman et al17 have also reported that selecting a pharmacologically relevant animal species for testing the safety and toxicity of novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies to support clinical testing can be challenging. Therefore, study data from multiple species become important as this will facilitate pharmacologists in preparing the suitable protocol for clinical trials and regulators to approve the same.",

We observed no histopathological changes in spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and bone marrow in animals exposed to ten times the therapeutic dose, suggesting the safety of the test material. In addition, there was no evidence of any exaggerated responses particularly in lymphoid tissues in the animals exposed to DRV or CRV at 10X dose even after 120 days post exposure. Tier-III investigations included monitoring of anti-dsDNA antibody assay (neutralizing antibodies) as well as anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) assay with a negative outcome. Absence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies in the serum of animals on day 120th after exposure to the intended clinical dose suggests that the vaccine is safe.
