It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased in COVID-19 and there was a significant relationship between lymphopenia and mortality. This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia. This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.",

After an atypical viral pneumonia case cluster in late 2019, a new coronavirus was reported from these cases in Wuhan, China in January 2020. With the developments that followed, this virus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported to cause a respiratory disease called COVID-19 in infected people [1] . In the light of the available data, although 81% of patients with COVID-19 had a mild disease, 14% had a serious illness requiring hospitalization and additional oxygen, and the remaining 5% had respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multi-organ dysfunction. Again, the information we obtained from all data, COVID-19 case death rates are around 2%, and it rises to 15% in patients aged 80 and over [1] .",
