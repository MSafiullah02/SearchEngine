The high case-fatality rate of MERS-CoV infections underlines the urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the burden of disease. Convalescent plasma therapy has been suggested as a promising option for improving disease outcome in MERS patients (Consortium, 2013). A meta-analysis of studies into the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in SARS patients showed a reduced case-fatality rate and reduced time to discharge in patients when treatment was administered early in the disease course; however, the quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was considered low and with a moderate to high risk of bias (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015).",

Polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations from the plasma of transchromosomal cows or horses vaccinated against MERS-CoV were also effective in reducing lung virus titers when administered to Ad5-hDPP4 mice one day after inoculation with MERS-CoV (Luke et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). However, despite promising results in mouse models, the high case-fatality rate in humans, low neutralizing antibody titers in survivors and the inability of many survivors to function as plasma donors due to underlying health issues are considerable hurdles in the implementation of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS patients (Arabi et al., 2016). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment could provide an alternative for convalescent plasma, and several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested in animal models (Agrawal et al., 2016; Corti et al., 2015; Houser et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016).",

Treatment of mice expressing human DPP4 under control of the mouse DPP4-regulatory elements with 200 \u03bcg of either REGN3048 or REGN3051 24hrs before inoculation with MERS-CoV significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs; similarly, treatment of mice with 500 \u03bcg REGN3051 24hrs after inoculation with MERS-CoV also reduced virus titers in the lungs. Inoculation of common marmosets with MERS-CoV results in coalescing bronchointerstitial pneumonia with clear signs of respiratory disease that may require euthanasia (Chan et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2014). Here, we evaluated the ability of the human, neutralizing mAbs REGN3048 and REGN3051 to reduce disease severity and virus replication in the lungs of common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. In this model, there was a clear clinical benefit upon prophylactic treatment with mAb; however, the effect of therapeutic mAb treatment on the disease course was limited.",

The marmosets in group II were treated prophylactically on day \u22121 with 25 mg/kg REGN3051; Group III was treated prophylactically on day \u22121 with a combination of REGN3048 and REGN3051 at 12.5 mg/kg each; group IV was treated therapeutically on day 1 with 10 mg/kg REGN3051 and group V was treated therapeutically on day 1 with 25 mg/kg. On 0, 2 and 6 days post inoculation (dpi), serum was collected from all animals to determine the level of MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. As expected, no neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were detected in the animals in group I that were infused with a control mAb (Fig. 1\n). The animals in groups II and III that were treated prophylactically had very high neutralizing antibody titers at the time of inoculation with MERS-CoV on day 0, ranging from 2560 to 7680 in individual animals. In five out of six animals in group II, the neutralizing titers had dropped between 0 and 6 dpi (Fig. 1). In group IV, neutralizing titers on 2 dpi ranged from 960 to 7680 and dropped to 960\u20131920 by 6 dpi. One animal in this group was euthanized due to severity of disease on 5 dpi; neutralizing titers in this animal were 2560 on 2 dpi and remained high at time of euthanasia (1280), so the severe disease observed in this animal was unlikely to be due to low neutralizing antibody titers. The animals in group V received a higher mAb dose than those in group IV, and this was reflected in the level of neutralizing antibodies detected in serum, that ranged from 1280 to 10,240 on 2 dpi. Titers dropped by 6 dpi in most animals to titers ranging from 2560 to 5120 (Fig. 1).",

In group I, viral loads in all lung lobes were consistently high; variation between animals was much larger in the groups treated with MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3\nA). Further analysis of complete lung viral loads (Fig. 3B) showed that viral loads of animals in treatment groups III and IV were statistically significantly lower (One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test) than those in animals in group I; viral loads in the lungs of animals in treatment groups II and V did not differ significantly from those in group I. Of note, the animal in group IV that was euthanized on 5 dpi was excluded from this analysis; however, even when this animal is included there is still a statistically significant difference between lung viral loads in group I vs. group IV, but the difference is smaller. These differences do not correlate with the dose of mAb administered to the animals. Various other tissues were also tested for the presence of viral RNA. The viral loads in respiratory tissues and lymph nodes that drain those tissues were often significantly higher in the animals in group I than in the treated groups II-V. In extra-respiratory tissues there were few significant differences between the viral loads in animals in control group I versus any of the treatment groups (Fig. 4\n). Of note, the animal in group IV that was euthanized on 5 dpi due to severity of disease, was excluded from these analyses.

Three mAbs have been evaluated in nonhuman primate models of MERS-CoV infection. The prophylactic efficacy of mAb 3B11N was determined in rhesus macaques, where treatment resulted in a reduction in pathologic lung volume in computed tomography (Johnson et al., 2016). In the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection, some therapeutic efficacy of mAbs m336 and MCA1 was seen when animals were treated with m336 at 6 h and 2 days post inoculation, and with MCA1 at 2 or 12 h post inoculation (Chen et al., 2017; van Doremalen et al., 2017). Although some improvement in clinical disease was seen as compared to mock-treated control animals, neither treatment prevented MERS-CoV disease. Here, we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV in the common marmoset model of moderate to severe MERS. There was a clinical benefit of mAb prophylaxis in our study, with a reduction in clinical disease scores in all prophylactically treated animals. The effect of antibody administration on lung viral loads and lung histopathology was not consistent; although clinical scores were reduced in both prophylactic treatment groups, viral lung loads and histological lesions were only significantly reduced in animals in group III treated with a combination of REGN3048 and REGN3051. When animals were treated therapeutically, we observed a smaller clinical benefit, with clinical disease scores returning to normal sooner in treated animals; Nevertheless, one of the therapeutically treated animals had to be euthanized due to signs of severe respiratory disease. However, there was no difference in the severity of lung pathology between control and therapeutically treated animals and thus no difference in the severity of the bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the marmoset model.",

One indication that penetration of mAb into the lung might at least partially explain the limited reduction in lung viral loads we observed, is the fact that viral loads in almost all other tissues were lower in all four treatment groups than in the control animals. It would thus be of interest to investigate alternative routes of administration such as nebulization to maximize the concentration of mAbs in the lungs (Respaud et al., 2015).",

Should the impact on patient treatment be limited by the timing of health seeking behavior by patients, MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs may still be useful for patient management during MERS-CoV outbreaks. Many MERS-CoV outbreaks have centered around health care settings, and the presence of comorbidities in MERS patients is linked to a poor prognosis. Thus, one could consider prophylactic treatment of specific target populations and their family members once several MERS cases have been identified in a health care facility, similar to the current practice of mAb prophylaxis of children at increased risk of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious and American Academy of Pediatrics Bronchiolitis Guidelines, 2014). Moreover, it is possible that neutralizing mAbs will provide therapeutic benefit when combined with other antiviral treatment regimens that are currently under investigation for MERS.",
