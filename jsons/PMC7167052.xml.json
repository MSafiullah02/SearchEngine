Any respiratory pathogens able to remain viable (infectious) after aerosolization and air transport are a potential cause of respiratory disease, and they are often associated with other substances to form \u2018complex particles\u2019 (Tang 2009). An example of a complex particle would be an influenza virion within a droplet composed of mucus, salts and water. Virus\u2010containing aerosols can be formed through natural occurrences, for example, sneezing by an individual harbouring a respiratory virus infection, or through mechanical means, for example, when air currents around contaminated surfaces disperse the viruses into the air (Verreault et al. 2008).",

Once airborne, small particles containing virus(es) can remain airborne for long periods of time, allowing for their transport to other locations (Fig. 1). They also remain adrift in air (i.e. airborne) for longer periods of time primarily because of their low settling velocity, for example, from 3\u00b71 \u00d7 10\u22123 m s\u22121 for 10\u2010\u03bcm particles to 3\u00b75 \u00d7 10\u22125 m s\u22121 for 1 \u03bcm particles (Hinds 1998). Among nose breathers, larger particles (>5 \u03bcm) tend to deposit on the surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, whereas inhalation of small particles into the lower lungs may pose a greater risk for pneumonia/severe infection than what occurs with deposition onto the upper respiratory tract (Vincent 2005; Killingley and Nguyen\u2010Van\u2010Tam 2013). Overall, smaller particles that contain respiratory viruses are potentially more dangerous because they stay airborne longer (and thus the risk for acquiring an infection is prolonged), and they get inhaled into the lower lungs, potentially causing diseases with more severe outcomes.",

            "text": "Adequate understanding about the routes of airborne virus transmission is important for protecting public health, especially as infection control procedures relevant for the spread of respiratory pathogens are founded on this body of knowledge. Based on current dogma, for example, the World Health Organization recommends that when possible, a patient with respiratory illness should be kept at least 1 m away from others to reduce spread of epidemic or pandemic\u2010prone respiratory diseases (WHO, 2014). Transmission of airborne viruses from one subject to another occurs mainly by three routes or a combination thereof: (i) direct or indirect contact of infectious secretions from infected hosts with mucus membranes of susceptible hosts, (ii) contact of virus\u2010containing droplets with surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, and (iii) inhalation of small aerosolized virus\u2010containing particles or droplet nuclei (droplet and aerosol transmissions are compared in Fig. 1). The relative importance of different transmission modes varies from one virus to another, with droplet transmission being traditionally regarded as the main route for respiratory viruses (Gerone et al. 1966; Gralton et al. 2011). However, due to inherent limitations of conventional impingement/impaction\u2010based bioaerosol samplers, which have low collection efficiencies for nanosized particles containing infectious viruses (Hogan et al. 2005; Cao et al. 2011), the aerosol transmission mode has not been adequately investigated. Nevertheless, evidence is mounting that aerosols are important for the transmission of airborne viruses (Cowling et al. 2013). For example, Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) has been proven to be transmitted by the aerosol mode (Gustafson et al. 1982; Gardam and Lemieux 2007); VZV DNA was detected in rooms of patients without varicella in a hospital with VZV\u2010infected patients (Sawyer et al. 1994), and directional airflow was consistent with VZV transmission (Gustafson et al. 1982). The importance of the aerosol transmission mode is still debated for influenza viruses. Although droplet infection is the commonly described mode of transmission for influenza viruses, they have also been detected in aerosols \u2018far away\u2019 (>1 m) from infected patients in a few studies. For example, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, and B viruses, were collected by a water\u2010based sampler located >2 m from patients in a student infirmary (Pan et al. 2017), and airborne influenza A H3N2 was collected by a Sioutas impactor 3\u00b77 m away from sick individuals (Lednicky and Loeb 2013).",

A recent estimate indicates that up to 646 000 persons in the world die every year of influenza (Iuliano et al. 2017). As the world population grows, modern agricultural production systems have greatly expanded, and these large\u2010scale operations provide enzootic opportunities for the spread of novel pathogens through aerosol routes (Jones et al. 2008; Sarkar et al. 2012). Increasing threats of bioterrorist attacks performed through aerosol dissemination of dangerous pathogens have also increased the need to develop methods for rapid detection and identification of airborne microbes (Mirski et al. 2014). Prompt and accurate detection of airborne pathogens and their identification are key to mitigating these biothreats that may have pandemic potential; they enable minimal exposure of personnel, minimal contamination of surfaces and when possible, allow for the initiation of early treatment, effective decontamination and infection control procedures, and for the selection of protective countermeasures. Methods to better and more reliably measure the concentration, size of particles carrying these viruses and transmission modes of aerosolized virus particles, in relation to their potential risks to humans and animals, are also needed to understand the principles that govern airborne virus transmission from host to host. This knowledge is of foremost importance for infection control. This review presents (i) a review of major limitations of existing sampling technologies for airborne respiratory viruses, (ii) the latest developments regarding samplers for airborne respiratory viruses, (iii) factors affecting their performance, and (iv) virus detection methodologies used in association with air samplers.",

            "text": "Impactors like the slit sampler and the Andersen 6\u2010stage sampler, and cyclones, have been used for sampling airborne viruses. They are active samplers that require a vacuum pump to draw in the aerosol, and particles in the incoming airstream get accelerated through small nozzles (in the form of holes or slits). As they are pulled through these devices, particles with high inertia impact onto the surface of collection media (Fig. 2) (Andersen 1958). Then, the collection media are recovered and aliquots thereof used for virus isolation or other analyses (Verreault et al. 2008). For example, a high\u2010resolution slit sampler with liquid collection medium was used for the collection of airborne Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (Booth et al. 2005); in that work, all virus cultures were negative, although 2 of the 10 samples were RT\u2010PCR (Reverse Transcription\u2010Polymerase Chain Reaction) positive. Reasons for the negative results might be that viruses were present in the air at relatively low levels or that these devices were inadequate for sampling aerosolized viruses. Practical limitations for the design of common impactors limit the smallest cut\u2010off size (particle diameter with 50% collection efficiency) to 0\u00b72\u20130\u00b73 \u03bcm. For example, to collect 30\u2010nm particles, a nozzle size of 63 \u03bcm (which is extremely challenging to manufacture) running at sonic velocity (which is damaging to viruses) is required.",

They are not designed as high\u2010efficiency (>95%) samplers for size ranges from 10 nm to more than 10 \u03bcm; collection efficiency is 30\u201390% for PM10 (particulate matter \u226410 \u03bcm) and 0\u201340% for PM2\u00b75 (particulate matter \u22642\u00b75 \u03bcm) for a conventional single\u2010stage cyclone (Cooper and Alley 2010). However, free virus particles can be smaller than 100 nm, and thus would not be collected efficiently. Modification of conventional cyclone samplers has somewhat improved their performance (Kenny et al. 2017). One sampler developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (Lindsley et al. 2006) is a multistage cyclone operating at a flowrate of 3\u00b75 l min\u22121: the first stage is a 15\u2010ml tube that collects aerosol particles >4 \u03bcm, the second is a 1\u00b75 ml tube that collects particles between 1 and 4 \u03bcm, and the third is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter that captures those <1 \u03bcm. Using this sampler to collect laboratory\u2010generated influenza A H1N1 virus aerosols inside a settling chamber, Cao et al. (2011) found that its collection efficiency for total quantity of collected viruses as measured by RT\u2010PCR was the same as that attained by sampling with an SKC BioSampler (considered the industry standard) for 15 min. With the BioSampler as a reference, however, only 34% of the viruses collected by the NIOSH cyclone remained infectious, probably due to desiccation. Blachere et al. (2009) used the NIOSH cyclone to collect airborne influenza virus in a hospital emergency department. They found that influenza A virus (IAV) RNA was detected by RT\u2010PCR in 11 out of 81 samples, and more than half of the aerosol particles that contained the virus were <4 \u03bcm, within the respirable particle size range (inhaled particles capable of passing beyond the ciliated airways) (Brown et al. 2013).",

In one study, a liquid cyclonic collector and an Andersen cascade impactor (ACI) were used to collect aerosolized IAV, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus particles generated by infected pigs (Alonso et al. 2015). Aliquots of collection media from both devices were used for RT\u2010PCR and virus isolation in cell cultures. All three viruses were found in that study, and there was no difference in geometric mean particle concentration in samples collected by either the cyclone or the ACI. Despite advancements in cyclone design, cut\u2010off sizes for these devices (mostly >1 \u03bcm) cannot meet the sampling requirements for small\u2010sized virus\u2010containing particles. Moreover, physical damage resulting from the actions of cyclones can deactivate viruses, resulting in an underestimate of the infectious viruses collected (Bourgueil et al. 1992).",

However, certain collection media used for bacteria and fungi are inappropriate for viruses. For example, mineral oil, which is non\u2010nutritive and thus does not support the replication of micro\u2010organisms but nevertheless maintains them live (which is important for accurate enumeration of the collected agents), cannot be used for viruses. When used for bacteria and fungi, the mineral oil\u2010collected micro\u2010organism mixture is filtered through a 0\u00b745\u2010\u03bcm filter and the micro\u2010organisms retained on the filter are recovered by washing them off into a vessel. For viruses, filtering mineral oil through the smaller pore\u2010size filters needed for viruses (such as 0\u00b722\u2010\u03bcm filters) requires excessive pressure that would be damaging to viruses.",

            "text": "Frequently used liquid impingers include all\u2010glass impingers (AGIs) and the BioSampler. AGIs work by forcing the airstream to change direction abruptly inside a bottle. During this sampling process, formation of air bubbles in the liquid collection medium inside the bottle on one hand increases the collection efficiency for small particles through diffusion, while on the other hand causes reaerosolization of collected viruses (Grinshpun et al. 1997; Riemenschneider et al. 2010). The BioSampler improves on the AGI\u201030 by (i) minimizing the effects of particle bounce and reaerosolization and (ii) extending its sampling time period while conserving viability of the collected micro\u2010organisms (Willeke et al. 1998). It works by depositing particles into the collection media in a swirling motion through three 0\u00b7630 mm tangential nozzles at sonic velocity, resulting in a cutoff size of around 300 nm (Lin et al. 2000). The BioSampler was used by Anderson et al. (2016) to study IAV during summer and fall/winter seasons in five swine farms. They found that shedding of IAV in pigs occurred in both seasons, but the detection of these aerosolized viruses was dependent on factors like climatic conditions or husbandry practices. The BioSampler was also used for the collection of IAV inhaled by a human manikin target (Tang et al. 2014) and IAV in live poultry markets (Kang et al. 2016). No influenza virus RNA was detected in the former study, possibly due to low virus concentration at distance from the virus source or the relatively short duration of manikin exposure, whereas avian influenza virus nucleic acid was found in aerosol samples in the latter study.",

Despite the advantage that their liquid collection medium can be directly used in molecular analytical technologies like PCR or Enzyme\u2010Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA), their use as reference needs to be further evaluated. First, their 0\u00b79\u2010cm inlets are designed to mimic the human upper respiratory system at removing large particles from the airstream (Henningson and Ahlberg 1994; Grinshpun et al. 1997). The inlet efficiency, defined as the fraction of particles entering the sampler to that in the ambient air, is above 98% for 1\u2010\u03bcm particles, but is substantially reduced to around 80% for 5 \u03bcm based on tests at the manufacturer's recommended flow rate of 12\u00b75 l min\u22121 (Grinshpun et al. 1994; Seshadri et al. 2009). The 20% observed loss for 5\u2010\u03bcm particles not getting into the sampler warrants caution in its use for sampling larger virus\u2010containing particles. Second, Han and Mainelis (2012) found that the adhesion of the deposited particles (fluorescent Polystyrene Latex (PSL)) and Bacillus subtilis cells and Cladosporium cladosporioides spores to the inner wall of the BioSampler was as high as 30% and the reaerosolization rates ranged from 0\u00b72% to 6\u00b79%. For the AGI\u201030, Riemenschneider et al. (2010) found that reaerosolization of MS2 bacteriophage (single virion particle size ~28 nm) increases as the flow rate increases. Moreover, Hogan et al. (2005) found the collection efficiencies of the AGI\u201030, the BioSampler and frit bubblers for bacteriophages MS2 and T3 (single virion particle size ~45 nm) are below 10% in the size range of 20\u2013100 nm. The 50% cut\u2010off sizes of both the BioSampler and the AGI\u201030 are 300 nm at 12\u00b75 l min\u22121. Anwar (2010) found that 8 l min\u22121 for the BioSampler was more effective for the sampling of MS2 aerosols due to collection by diffusion and maintenance of virus infectivity. While collection by diffusion is enhanced at a low flow rate, reduction in flow rate results in lower physical collection efficiency that relies on inertia. Hence, caution should be exercised in further reduction in the flow rate, and research to determine the optimal flow rate for sampling airborne virus is warranted. Finally, the BioSampler's high centrifugal force also inactivates a significant fraction of influenza viruses (Fabian et al. 2009; Lednicky et al. 2016). Hence, new samplers for airborne viruses that allow for less violent but efficient sampling in the wide size range of virus\u2010containing particles are in great need.",

The collection efficiencies of gelatin filters for viable hydrophilic viruses were found to be 10 times better than for Nucleopore polycarbonate filters, since many hydrophilic viruses need to be hydrated to remain viable (Tseng and Li 2005). Nevertheless, sampling and extraction problems still prevail with gelatin filters. Fabian et al.

A simple system composed of a portable MD8 air sampler connected by a hose to a gelatin filter was used for the capture of influenza viruses in cough aerosols, although virus deactivation was reported to be a problem (Hatagishi et al. 2014). Sampling conditions are very important for successful virus collection on gelatin filters; low RH can lead to desiccation of viruses and high RH leads to dissolution of gelatin filters (Verreault et al. 2008). These filters must be used in short periods of time (<15 min sampling time) as they dry out quickly, and at higher temperatures they melt (Fabian et al. 2009). Thus, filter\u2010collected viruses are typically more suitable for molecular analyses than for assessments of infectivity, as desiccation, extraction and postsampling processes significantly inactivate a significant fraction of the infectious viruses (Li et al. 1999; Tseng and Li 2005; Burton et al. 2005).",

The ESP works by creating a corona discharge that places charges on airborne particles, resulting in an electrostatic attraction that draws the charged particles to electrodes (Fig. 2; Hinds 1998). The ESP has a size\u2010dependent collection efficiency; total mass\u2010based collection efficiencies are high (e.g. 99%), but typically low for submicrometre or nanometre particles (Yoo et al. 1997; Kettleson et al. 2009). Jang et al. (2007) developed a flow\u2010swirling\u2013based ESP without a corona discharger, and this device successfully collected Vaccinia viruses, which are brick shaped with dimensions around 200 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 250 nm3 (Jang et al. 2008). Problems with this device are its inability to collect larger particles (>10 \u03bcm), which are less likely to swirl as a result of increased inertia compared to viruses in nanometre ranges. Also, fewer Vaccinia viruses were collected compared with nanoparticles of similar size as the viruses could aggregate to form large particles rather than remaining as individual particles. Hong et al. (2016) applied a personal ESP for sampling submicrometre\u2010sized MS2 and T3 viruses, and found out that the recovery rate for MS2 and T3 were more than 10 times higher than the BioSampler at 12\u00b75 l min\u22121; its collection efficiency at the flow rate of 1\u00b72 l min\u22121 reached 99\u00b73\u201399\u00b78% for 0\u00b705\u20132\u2010\u03bcm diameter PSL particles, although the efficiency for virus\u2010containing particles is not available. Compared with inertia\u2010based samplers, the ESP consumes less energy and it is easier to make it portable. However, ozone formation in the ESP limits its use for sampling infectious viruses, as ozone is intrinsically a virus\u2010inactivating agent (Wells et al. 1991).",

After 2000, systems based on water vapour condensation have been developed for collection of airborne viruses. Oh et al. (2010) designed two bioaerosol amplification units (BAU); their tests with MS2 showed that the mixing type BAU (mBAU) performed better than the cooling type BAU and the number of viable MS2 collected by mBAU increased two to three fold after amplification compared to that without amplification. Orsini et al. (2008) combined a condensation growth chamber with a cyclone to collect a rod\u2010shaped plant virus (Tobamovirus) and a protein\u2010enveloped insect virus (Baculovirus). Using an adiabatic chamber, Yu et al. (2018) increased MS2\u2010containing particles to >1 \u03bcm by controlling compression pressure and temperature. The exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is another condensation\u2010based device used for sampling influenza A H3N2 virus (Horvath et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2012). In this device, exhaled breath condenses into tiny liquid droplets on a hydrophobic collection surface (parafilm) due to the low temperature caused by ice and the hydrophobic nature of the surface. As the EBC was specifically designed for sampling exhaled breath, the efficiency for sampling airborne infectious viruses is unknown (Horv\u00e1th et al. 2017). Above all, collection efficiencies of viable viruses by the above\u2010mentioned water\u2010based samplers still have much space for improvement due to particle wall loss or less effective amplification (e.g. unable to create supersaturation to enable condensation).",

More recently, water\u2010based condensational technologies have undergone changes to overcome the limitations of butanol based CPCs. This includes introduction of cooled aerosols into warm wet\u2010walled growth tubes to minimize wall losses (Oh et al. 2010), and maintaining the condensation system at a lower temperature to sustain the viability of viruses being sampled (Orsini et al. 2003). An emerging virus aerosol sampler, the water\u2010based laminar\u2010flow condensational growth tube collector (GTC), has been tested for collecting laboratory\u2010generated bacteriophage MS2 and IAV aerosols, and for airborne viruses in a student infirmary. For MS2\u2010containing particles, the collection efficiency of the GTC for infectious MS2 was more than 10 times higher than that of the BioSampler (Pan et al. 2016). For laboratory\u2010generated infectious IAV, the GTC's collection efficiency was seven times higher than that of the BioSampler (Lednicky et al. 2016). For real\u2010world sampling, the GTC collected more types of airborne viruses and higher quantities per sampling run than the BioSampler (Pan et al. 2017). These results indicate the GTC can be used for surveillance of airborne viruses. The GTC mimics what happens in human lungs on a cold day by introducing cold aerosol particles into a warm growth tube saturated with water vapour. This process encapsulates small particles into larger droplets, thus enabling efficient collection of these enlarged particles through gentle impaction (Fig. 2) (Hering et al. 2005; Hering and Stolzenburg 2005). Physical collection efficiencies of this GTC are above 90% for particles as small as 30 nm and as large as 10 \u03bcm (Lednicky et al. 2016). Current limitations of the GTC samplers are that they are bulky (considerable size and weight) and they require special skills to operate or maintain.",

Some combine different sampling mechanisms by using inertia\u2010based methods for large particles, and diffusion based methods like filtration, or water condensation, for small particles. Some devices can distinguish between coarse and fine particles, and they usually have higher collection efficiencies in a wider particle size range than attainable with the older devices. As an example, McDevitt et al. (2013) built a sampler (G\u2010II) that operates at a high flow rate of 130 l min\u22121 to collect exhaled breath particles, and the collected viruses can be used in infectivity analyses. The G\u2010II incorporates three parts: (i) an impaction substrate to collect particles >5 \u03bcm, (ii) a Condensation Growth Unit and (iii) a slit impactor to collect particles >1 \u03bcm. Test results obtained using spherical PSL particles revealed more than 85% collection efficiency for particles larger than 50 nm, although collection for influenza virus was equitable with that obtained using a BioSampler. Agranovski et al. (2002) designed a personal sampler that passes aerosol particles through a porous medium submerged in a liquid layer. Evaluated for the collection of influenza viruses at a flow rate of 4 l min\u22121 (Pyankov et al. 2007), it recovered 65\u201368% of the virus particles. This device was also used for monitoring airborne measles virus in a natural environment (Agranovski et al. 2008). The applicability of these samplers designed to operate using multiple mechanisms is still exploratory, as their overall collection efficiencies, both physically or biologically, have not been fully evaluated, and these combinatorial systems have complicated features. Most have been only tested for one or two types of viruses. In addition, compared with water\u2010based CPCs, collection efficiencies using these devices are lower.",

            "text": "The pros and cons of each type of samplers for airborne viruses are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the collection efficiencies for airborne viruses by samplers such as the water\u2010based CPC or the integration of inertial or diffusion\u2010based samplers have improved steadily, but development is still needed for light\u2010weight and portable samplers that can collect a variety of infectious airborne viruses present in a wide size range of aerosolized particles. Until a standard sampler and procedure for sampling aerosols containing infectious viruses are developed, our understanding of airborne virus transmission remains stilted. It is impossible to accurately reconcile results from different laboratories that use different samplers based on different sampling and analytical methods for the collection of airborne viruses. Moreover, flow rates used for virus\u2010containing aerosol sampling are generally low (less than 12\u00b75 l min\u22121), and this limits the amount of air that can be sampled. Given the low virus concentration in the air, sampling at high flow rates might facilitate fast detection of airborne viruses, although the associated high flow velocity may damage viruses. Hence, a balance between high volume of sampled air and maintenance of virus viability is needed. Finally, the \u2018collection efficiencies\u2019 reported in many virus aerosol studies are in reality \u2018relative collection efficiencies\u2019; they are measures of the amount of virus collected by one sampler compared to that collected or calculated by a reference sampler. One reason for this gap in reporting is that a large percentage of the test virus is deactivated during aerosol generation or sampling processes (Zhen et al. 2014; Walls et al. 2016), and quantification of their inactivation rate proves challenging. The absolute efficiency of a virus sampler is very important for health risk assessments, because even if the tested sampler has high collection efficiency compared with some sampler considered to be state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art, it might still be possible that both samplers do not collect sufficient quantities of airborne viruses for accurate risk assessments. Thus, future studies should develop reference samplers that have verifiable absolute collection efficiency, although currently there is no clear solution yet.",

If aerosolized, non\u2010lipid\u2010enveloped viruses can be unstable below about 70% RH as a result of denaturation of virus surface structures. In contrast, lipid\u2010enveloped viruses such as vaccinia virus, may have reduced stability in air if RH is above 70% (Cox 1987; Tellier 2006). These observations fit well with the general belief that phospho\u2010lipid\u2013protein complexes in enveloped viruses are usually more likely to denature in the air at medium to high RH, whereas the protein coats of non\u2010enveloped viruses are more readily to denature at low RH (Cox and Wathes 1995). One the other hand, when influenza virus is suspended in a medium that closely mimics respiratory tract fluids, the effect of humidity on survival is greatly diminished (Kormuth et al. 2018). Transmission of airborne viruses is also affected by RH; another plausible explanation for the fact that influenza is more likely to occur in winter (low RH) is that settling of airborne viruses due to condensation occurs to a lower extent in winter, and therefore the chances of inhaling airborne influenza viruses is much greater than during summer (high RH) (Lowen et al. 2007). Moreover, RH is important in filtration collection, as desiccation has always been a problem for viruses trapped on filters (Tseng and Li 2005; Fabian et al. 2009; Lindsley et al. 2010). These studies illustrate that sampling or transport, rather than aerosol generation or sample storage, account for the loss of virus viability. Hence, sampling process should provide the optimum RH for the targeted infectious virus.",

The use of serum as an aid for maintaining virus viability is not a new concept, for example, PBS containing 5% inactivated ox serum was used for sampling Foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (Sellers and Parker 1969). Serum and other stabilizers have not always been included in liquid collection media, for example, PBS with or without calcium and magnesium has been used for the collection of influenza virus (Fabian et al. 2009). Appert et al.

Another problem is the definition of particle size.

Usachev et al. (2012) described several technologies used in conjunction with a personal bioaerosol sampler for real\u2010time detection of viruses. They found that real\u2010time PCR technique allows detection of bacteriophages MS2 and T4, but the whole procedure takes a long time (h). The combination of a personal sampler with surface plasmon resonance (SPR)\u2010based immunosensor allows for rapid detection of MS2; the entire sampling and analysis procedure can be done in 6 min (Usachev et al. 2013). Later, Usachev et al. (2015) used multiplexed SPR for simultaneous detection of MS2 bacteriophage and IAV. The SPR response units increased with increasing virus concentration, and the sensitivity of this technology was high enough to minimize false alarm. Although the overall response for multiplex SPR slightly decreased compared with singleplex SPR, there was no statistical difference in sensitivity between the two for the target viruses. A limitation with these types of real\u2010time samplers and analyses is that at the current state\u2010of\u2010art, viruses can only be detected when they are present at relatively high concentrations. For example, the detection limit of the SPR was 7 \u00d7 107 PFU per ml in the sampling liquids, with a liquid volume of 0\u00b71 ml used in their work, whereas for viruses such as IAV, the quantity exhaled by human beings might be lower than 1000 per 30 min (Milton et al. 2013).",

Problems with these traditional samplers include: (a) inefficiency at the collection of fine particles, (b) dehydration of viruses during the collection process, (c) damage of the virus during collection due to impaction forces, resulting in the loss of viability of some or all the collected viruses, (d) reaerosolization leading to the loss of viruses from the collection media, and (e) losses due to viruses being trapped by the inlet or the samplers\u2019 wall. Samplers based on newer technologies, such the water\u2010based condensation or the integration of multiple principles, are in development for the sampling of airborne viruses. Information resulting from the use of these technologies will enhance our knowledge of virus transmission through airborne routes and the biothreats posed by virus aerosols.",

No single device has been demonstrated capable of serving as the gold standard sampler, one that can efficiently sample a wide size range (10 nm to >10 \u03bcm) of virus\u2010containing aerosols, and conserve the viability of the collected viruses. In addition, collection efficiencies reported in most virus aerosol studies refer to relative collection efficiency, not absolute collection efficiency, resulting in underestimates of the concentrations of infectious virus particles. Moreover, due to the low concentration of airborne viruses and the inactivation of infectious viruses due to sampling processes, methods to balance the need for high volume sampling air and maintaining virus viability during their collection are needed. Finally, for proper biothreat analyses, further investigations are needed on the size distribution of aerosolized particles that contain infectious viruses, as well as on the factors that affect their concentrations and size distributions. Knowledge gaps resulting from inconclusive information are summarized in Table 2 as a reference for future research studies.",

Shown are an impactor, cyclone, filter, impinger, electrostatic precipitator and a water\u2010based growth tube collector. Impactor: particles in the incoming airstream accelerate through small nozzles (in the form of holes or slits), and those with high inertia impact onto the surface of collection media. Cascade Impactor: by successively decreasing nozzle size, particles are classified by their inertia to be collected onto different size stages. Cyclone: centrifugal forces deviate particles from the air flow to impact onto the collection wall. Impinger: Abrupt change in the airstream direction inside the bottle impacts particles into the liquid collection medium. Filtration: Particles are collected onto filter media through interception, inertial impaction, and diffusion. Electrostatic precipitator: Particles are first charged through corona discharge to create electrostatic attraction that draws the charged particles to collection plates (oppositely charged). Water\u2010based growth tube collector: Cold aerosol particles are introduced into a warm growth tube saturated with water vapour. This process encapsulates small particles into larger droplets, thus enabling efficient collection of these enlarged particles through gentle impaction.
