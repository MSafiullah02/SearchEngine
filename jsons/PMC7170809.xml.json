It was confirmed at that moment that COVID-19 was restricted to clusters, and infection was contained at phase 2 of the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP).2 These harsh measures were to limit further viral dissemination, and the importance of personal hygiene, social distancing methods, and self-confinement wherever possible was strongly advised.",

Government policy advised only self-isolation if possible and confinement of children at home for those returning from Italy. The first French COVID-19 cluster appeared in the Oise region by February 25.

The annual Paris Agricultural salon regrouping farmers from all over France was canceled on the final day to much dismay and confusion. Throughout this time, the importance of handwashing and individual behaviors to limit transmission were constantly droned by authorities. However, public ambivalence may have also been due to the scientific community minimizing the effects of infection comparing it with seasonal influenza. Limited knowledge about COVID-19, advocated that infection was fairly \u201charmless\u201d with fatalities limited only to high-risk groups, ie, essentially the elderly (a message still communicated until very recently). By March 4, public concern about the epidemic started to result in the first signs of panic resulting in stocks of masks and hydroalcoholic gel to be exhausted.6 Consequently, the government requisitioned protective masks, communicating that this form of protective barrier should be reserved only for those who displayed signs of illness and for use by health professionals. In addition to this, the price of hydroalcoholic disinfectant gel was blocked to prevent profiteering. However, at present the stocks of masks and hydroalcoholic disinfectant gel is still precariously low.",

Although the application of the French PIP to a disease that spreads more rapidly than influenza with a higher morbidity and mortality rate is debatable. The virus\u2019s basic reproductive number (Ro) is estimated to be between 2 and 3, although some publications have reported a Ro of 11.10 While disease mortality varied according to different populations (3-4% mortality in China, 7% in Italy).11 Rising case fatality rates in France as the epidemic progressed and the success of confinement measures experienced other countries contributed to the decision to impose nationwide confinement. Robust mathematical modeling and clinical experience revealed that the infection rate was underestimated, following the same kinetic as the Italian epidemic.11 In the absence of mass confinement, approximately 30 million people would be infected with an epidemiological peak reached in 50 days. Clinical observations in France illustrated all age groups over 25 years affected and clinical manifestations ranged from asymptomatic, mild (80% of cases), to severe. Half of intensive care unit (ICU) patients were under 60 years, with 5% requiring respiratory assistance. For unknown reasons, severe complications have also occurred in healthy patients unaffected by extreme age or comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, etc.). It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory medication may be the root cause for this phenomenon. In contrast children are largely asymptomatic healthy carriers (hence, the closure of schools).",
