Certain variations in the geographical distribution of endemic fungal infections can be attributed to climate changes, an extension of human habitats, ease of travel, and shifting populations.

Nowadays, fungi previously not considered pathogenic, including mucoraceous genera (formerly called zygomycetes), and many hyaline and dematiaceous molds are frequently seen affecting immunocompromised patients. Therefore, diagnosis of infection versus colonization with these fungi is a common issue that has important treatment implications (Guarner and Brandt 2011). Moreover, advances in diagnostic imaging and specific patient support have permitted the possibility of collecting biopsy specimens for histological examination from sites previously not reachable; nevertheless, these advantages come with challenges related to the limited amount of tissue obtained and the architectural distortion produced by the procedure (Gavito-Higuera et al. 2016).",

However, this demonstration requires a brain biopsy, which is one of the most important limitations (De Pauw et al. 2008). Frequently, fungi when present in tissue are not easily visible using routine stains; thus, Gomori methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining can be used to improve their visibility and allow a better morphological identification (Schwartz et al. 2018; De Pauw et al. 2008). Some microscopic fungal characteristics can allow its identification to a genus level. For example, Aspergillus species can be differentiated from Mucorales by their septate, dichotomous branching hyphae, whereas Mucorales have an irregular shape of mostly uniseptate or pauciseptate hyphae. Some organisms show specific morphological characteristics, which can help in their identification. For example, H. capsulatum are small intracellular, budding yeasts; B. dermatitidis are thick-walled, broad-based budding yeasts; P. brasiliensis is big yeasts with small yeasts attached given a so-called pilot-wheel configuration; and Coccidioides species manifest themselves as large spherules that contain endospores (De Pauw et al. 2008; McCarthy et al. 2014).",

Currently, it is accepted that the subphylum Mucoromycotina has two orders, the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. The former was originally identified as affecting insects and causing mucocutaneous disease in immunocompetent human hosts, while the Mucorales cause a spectrum of predominantly angioinvasive disease in immunosuppressed patients (Fig. 6.3f (Courtesy of A.

Another important example involves Pneumocystis jirovecii, as when distinguishing this organism, it is important to know that it lacks budding and has an intracystic focus.

Furthermore, in patients with localized disease (nondisseminated), the antigen burden is lower, and thus sensitivity is lower. With those limitations, combining the results of detection of antigen in urine and serum may increase the sensitivity in patients with localized histoplasmosis (Swartzentruber et al. 2009).",

Nevertheless, differences in morphology or clinical presentation have been found between the entities produced by each species. An interesting correlation between the incidence of the disease and specific environmental factors is commonly reported; for example, coccidioidomycosis incidence increases when there are rainy summers followed by dry winters, after earthquakes, or when humans establish themselves on the previously recognized endemic areas. Thus, when any of these situations take place, Coccidioides arthrospores are released in higher concentrations compared with the usual baseline (Parish and Blair 2008).",

The yeasts can be identified in many samples, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, fine-needle aspirates, CSF, and biopsy specimens. When the H&E stain is used, the thick refractile cell wall gives the appearance of a space between the fungal cell contents and the surrounding tissue. The multiple nuclei of the yeast stain with hematoxylin. Sometimes, this fungus can show small yeast forms, called microforms. Additionally, B. dermatitidis can be identified with routinely used preparations such as Papanicolaou and KOH. The contour of the yeast is best appreciated with silver stains such as PAS or GMS (Patel et al. 2010; Lemos et al. 2000).",

The diagnostic yield of histopathology will depend on the expertise of the pathologist (McKinnell and Pappas 2009). Because of the possibility of false-positive results, pathologists must describe the yeast and budding pattern observed in the tissue and also should add a commentary in the report about the yeasts that can have similar morphology. In addition, alternative tests should be performed to determine if the patient truly has blastomycosis, especially in cases from areas where the disease is not endemic or when the clinical presentation is not usual.",

Because of the cross-reactivity, it is useful to perform antigen tests for both blastomycosis and histoplasmosis. Detection of antibodies to B. dermatitidis in serum using traditional complement fixation and immunodifusion has poor specificity and sensitivity; however, as antigens have been better purified and used in radioimmunodiffusion and EIAs, the sensitivity and specificity of serology are significantly higher (McKinnell and Pappas 2009).",

The broad spectrum in clinical and pathogenic presentation makes its diagnosis a big challenge. When a tissue or liquid specimen is available, the pathological analysis is a very useful tool for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Usually, pathological studies can provide results before the culture or other analyses are available. Nevertheless, it is important to remember the limitations of this approach because many of the fungal structures among different species are very similar. Therefore, it could be really easy to misdiagnose a specific fungal infection, which would have a relevant impact on therapy. Thus, it is always important to consider the clinical information, as well as complementary analysis, in order to obtain a definitive ethological diagnosis.",
