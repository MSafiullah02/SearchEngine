The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes for polypeptides that are subsequently cleaved by viral proteinases to yield 16 functional proteins, mainly involved in viral RNA synthesis. The proteins on the 3\u2032-proximal region of the genome are individually expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs generated by an unique discontinuous transcription mechanism (Enjuanes et al., 2006). These mRNAs cover the four structural proteins; the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, and five accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b which are most likely produced by leaky scanning from two gene cluster open reading frames ORF3 and ORF7 (Schaecher et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Based on virus antigenicity, two serotypes can be distinguished among FCoVs. Type I feline coronaviruses are most commonly found in the field (Addie et al., 2003, Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Vennema, 1999). Type II feline coronaviruses originate from a double recombination between type I feline coronavirus and canine coronavirus (CCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Until now, most experiments have been done with type II viruses because type I viruses are difficult to grow in vitro. Both serotypes contain two pathotypes. The low virulent feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is endemic in the cat population and causes mostly asymptomatic infections. In young kittens, it can cause mild gastrointestinal infections (Pedersen et al., 1981). The highly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) manifests in a progressive and mostly fatal disease, FIP, characterized by granulomatous lesions (Pedersen et al., 2009). The most prominent factor that determines the difference between the two pathotypes is the ability to establish an efficient and productive infection in monocytes/macrophages (Dewerchin et al., 2005, Rottier et al., 2005). The low virulent FECV mainly infects enterocytes but can also enter and replicate in monocytes (Dewerchin et al., 2005, Meli et al., 2004). However, it was shown in vitro that after one replication cycle, the percentage of FECV infected monocytes decreases (Dewerchin et al., 2005). This is probably the reason why only low viral loads of FECV can be found systemically and infection does not lead to FIP. In contrast, the highly pathogenic counterpart, FIPV, has the ability to productively infect monocytes and this sustained infection is probably the basis for the development of FIP (Kipar et al., 2006).",

            "text": "RNA viruses, such as FCoVs, generally have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses, because viral RNA polymerases lack proof-reading. This, together with the close genetic similarity of FECV to FIPV and the low incidence of FIP, despite the high prevalence of FCoV seropositive cats, led to the widespread acceptance of the \u201cinternal mutation theory\u201d. Numerous publications supported that FIPV, unlike FECV, is not transmitted from cat to cat but arises from FECV by mutation within an individual cat (Chang et al., 2010, Herrewegh et al., 1995, Pedersen et al., 2012, Rottier et al., 2005, Vennema et al., 1998). Up till now, it is not yet completely clarified what these FIP-inducing mutations in FECV might be. The C-terminal domain of the FIPV spike protein has already been shown to be important for efficient macrophage infection (Chang et al., 2012, Rottier et al., 2005). In addition, accessory proteins have been proposed to be potential targets for mutations and as such important for virulence. These accessory proteins are species-specific and are dispensable for in vitro replication. During passaging of CoVs in cell cultures, viral mutants with deletions in accessory ORFs arise spontaneously and show growth advantages (Lorusso et al., 2008), suggesting that loss of accessory gene expression increases viral fitness in vitro. Despite their redundancy in vitro, deletion of accessory ORF clusters from FIPV 79-1146, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome resulted in attenuated viruses (de Haan et al., 2002, Haijema et al., 2004, Ortego et al., 2003). Thus, these proteins are of key importance for virus\u2013host interactions and critically contribute to viral virulence and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, a clear function could not be attributed so far to any of the accessory proteins of FCoVs.",

In the first quarter of the amino acid sequence of the 3c gene, big differences are observed between type I and type II FCoVs. Again the double recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV could explain these differences. Remarkably, in studies of Pedersen et al. (2012) and Chang et al. (2010) 60\u201371.4% of FIP isolates, had a truncated 3c protein, while in FECV isolates from feces this protein was intact. Chang et al. launched the hypothesis that 3c could be necessary for replication in enterocytes but dispensable or even a burden during FIPV infection in monocytes. This may also explain the restricted transmission of FIPV from cat to cat (Addie et al., 1996). A recent study added to these findings that a truncated ORF3 was important for efficient in vitro replication of FIPV type II in feline monocytes (Balint et al., 2012).",

A lot of single amino acid polymorphisms are present between FCoV strains (Herrewegh et al., 1995). Antibodies against 7b protein, found in serum of asymptomatic FCoV-seropositive and FIP cats, imply expression of this protein during natural infections (Kennedy et al., 2008). The 7b protein contains a KDEL-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (=KTEL) at its C-terminus (Vennema et al., 1992). The 7b protein is initially retained in the ER, whereupon it is secreted from infected cells. As 7b is released extracellular, it might function as a virokine which acts as an immune-modulator of host immune responses (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Rottier, 1999). Again the real function has not yet been elucidated.",

All the viruses were able to initially infect monocytes but only wt-FIPV and FIPV-\u03943 sustained their replication while the replication kinetics of FIPV-\u03947 and FIPV-\u03943\u03947 dropped after one cycle.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that newly produced viruses deleted in ORF7 were not able to enter new monocytes or that virus protein synthesis was inhibited (by an antiviral response) in monocytes cultured for some time in an infected environment. Because currently, accessory proteins are not found in the envelope of feline coronaviruses, it is unlikely that they play a role during binding with and entry of the target cell. Counteraction on the antiviral response is a far more plausible function for proteins 7a and/or 7b. When cells are infected, they can warn neighboring cells of viral presence by releasing interferon (IFN). This induces production of several antiviral proteins that have roles in combating viruses or blocking protein synthesis in response to new viral infection (Goodbourn et al., 2000). As ORF7 is located at the 3\u2032 far end of the viral genome, where transcription starts (Dye and Siddell, 2005), 7a and 7b mRNA is produced at the very beginning of replication, indicating an early translation of proteins 7a and 7b. It is likely that these proteins interfere quickly with one or more effects of IFN in newly infected cells and as such inhibiting the antiviral response. As a consequence, viruses deleted in ORF7 may not counteract with IFN induced antiviral responses anymore and virus replication may be blocked. The crucial role of ORF7 in FIPV replication in monocytes in vitro, as shown in our study, could also give an explanation for the attenuated phenotype of ORF7 deletion mutants in vivo, observed by Haijema et al. (2004).",

            "text": "In contrast to ORF7 proteins, ORF3 proteins were less important for virus replication in monocytes because FIPV-\u03943 was still capable of sustaining infection in feline monocytes up till 24 hpi. However, the increase in infected monocytes and the resulting virus titer was less pronounced for FIPV-\u03943 than for wt-FIPV. These results showed that at least one of the ORF3 encoded accessory proteins should be intact for optimal replication. FIPV-\u03943 is distinguished from wt-FIPV 79-1146 by a deletion of only the 3a and 3b genes, since the 3c gene of wt-FIPV 79-1146 encodes for a truncated 3c protein (Volker, 2007), which also appears in 60\u201371.4% of in vivo FIPV strains (Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2012). Thus, the somewhat lower replication capacity of FIPV-\u03943 in monocytes is most likely due to the lack of protein 3a and/or 3b. The use of the truncated wt-FIPV in the present study can also explain the, at first sight, contrasting results obtained by Balint et al. (2012). They showed that an ORF3 truncation was needed for efficient FIPV type II replication in monocytes/macrophages. Our results demonstrate that ORF3c-truncated wt-FIPV 79-1146 indeed efficiently replicates in monocytes/macrophages, but that at least one of the other proteins (3a and 3b) should be intact to support FIPV replication in monocytes.",

The significant lower titer obtained for FIPV-\u03947 and FIPV-\u03943\u03947 was explained by a lower production capacity of these viruses in fcwf cells (10 times less infectious virus than wt-FIPV) compared to CrFK cells. This phenomenon could be ascribed to macrophage features of the fcwf cells (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983). The impaired replication of FIPV-\u03947 and FIPV-\u03943\u03947 in fcwf cells, seen in this study, confirmed the role of ORF7 in efficient replication of FIPV in its host cells (monocytes/macrophages), suggesting a function in typical macrophage pathways.",

            "text": "In conclusion, it was found that deleting ORF7 from type II FIPV 79-1146 had a negative impact on the replication kinetic in feline monocytes. Thus, proteins encoded by ORF7 play a decisive role in sustaining the replication of type II FIPV in its in vivo target cell. This role is most probably a general function for the 7a/7b proteins in both type I (most prevalent in the field) and type II FCoVs. Sequence analysis revealed that 7a gene is well conserved among both serotype FCoV strains. Although, the 7b gene shows more single amino acid polymorphisms (\u223c5-8%), these are not serotype related. The moderate effect of an ORF3 deletion from type II FIPV, indicates that proteins encoded by ORF3 have only a supportive role in the replication. Despite the homology of ORF3 within the two serotypes, clear differences are present in between them. This is due to the fact that type II FCoVs received their ORF3 (together with the spike gene) from CCoVs by double recombination with type I FCoVs. It remains to be determined if the ORF3 is of the same importance for the replication of type I field isolates in feline monocytes. The results of this study will aid in the understanding of the role of accessory proteins in FCoV infections of monocytes. Although it is still only a tip of the iceberg, our discoveries are a step forward in unraveling the function(s) of the accessory proteins of FCoVs and give indications for further research in the involvement of the accessory proteins (such as 7a and/or 7b) in antiviral pathways.",
