This syndrome is not specific to any one microorganism in particular, but has been described following bacterial infections (due to Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and recently, following infection with ETEC producing heat-labile toxins), as well as viral an protozoan infections (such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Dientamoeba fragilis). Little is known of its pathogenesis, which is probably multifactorial 105, 106 . No one is really certain of the true incidence of PI-IBS among travelers. In a cohort of 2,476 Swiss travelers, 3% of those who suffered an episode of traveler's diarrhea developed PI-IBS in the following 6 months 107 . Given that diagnosis of PI-IBS is fundamentally clinical and symptom-based, and that an episode of traveler's diarrhea can exacerbate further a pre-existing irritable bowel syndrome in the traveler, it is critical to obtain details of the gastrointestinal status of the patient before travel 108,109 . Tropical sprue is an entity without a definite etiology that occurs in certain tropical and sub-tropical geographic areas. Its guiding symptom is nutrient malabsorption. Its clinical spectrum may simulate anything from PI-IBS to celiac disease and little is known of its pathogenesis 110 . This entity was essentially described between the 1950s and 1970s 111 , and its incidence may be underestimated, in view of the growing number of sporadic cases reported in recent years 112, 113 . It largely affects long-term residents and expatriates in tropical areas within 30 degrees north and south of the equator, and is particularly prevalent in southern India, Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, although it has also been described in the northern part of South America, the Caribbean and West Africa 114 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "105,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "106", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1697, "text": "112,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1701, "text": "113", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 101, "text": "(PI-IBS)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Causative agents"}, {"text": "The diagnostic method of choice for intestinal parasites is an examination of the stools, with at least three samples being recommended 115 , preferably on alternate days 116 or collected over a period of 7-10 days given the intermittent fecal excretion of diagnostic forms 77 .

Techniques for the detection of antigens in stool specimens (by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) for Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp. and Entamoeba histolytica) or for the detection and identification of virus genome in stools by PCR (Entamoeba spp. and Dientamoeba fragilis) give increased sensitivity compared to conventional methods and enable Entamoeba histolytica to be differentiated from E. dispar, for example, which are otherwise pathogenically and morphologically indistinguishable. Blastocystis hominis cysts are frequently identified in chronic diarrhea and remain a controversial topic 118,119 ; they should be interpreted as non-pathogenic commensals without therapeutic indications, although they serve as markers to confirm oral-fecal contamination or the presence of other unidentified underlying parasites. Nonetheless, given the presence of symptoms and having reasonably ruled out other causative agents, a therapeutic trial may be attempted. The diagnostic methods for helminthiasis associated with persistent diarrhea are indicated in section IV.5.

Even so, the true incidence in those travelers in whom community-acquired C. difficile infection is more likely (with no prior history of antimicrobials or contact with the healthcare system), and who may therefore help spread hypervirulent strains, is unknown 120 . The use of ELISA for detection of toxins in fecal specimens has low sensitivity 65-85% despite its speed and high specificity (95-100%), so that detection of antigens in stool specimens (glutamate dehydrogenase, just as quick but higher sensitivity) tends to be used as a screening test, with subsequent confirmation by culture or PCR. Since, detection of C. difficile in a clinical sample does not always equate with disease, diagnosis continues to be challenging for the clinician and in the laboratory 121 .

With very few exceptions, it tends to appear in long-term travelers who stay in areas where filariasis is endemic; the clinical manifestations appear later and are often not immediately associated with travel 227-231 . All filariasis is spread by being bitten by diptera (flies or mosquitoes), although the species involved are different. The species of filarial worms that most frequently give rise to skin lesions are Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Wuchereria bancrofti and Dirofilaria repens 232 . Infection with the different species of Brugia (B. malayi or B. timori) or Mansonella (M. perstans, M. ozzardi, M. streptocerca) is rare among travelers. Clinical symptoms vary depending on the species involved: nodules (O. volvulus, D. repens), diffuse disfiguring alterations of the skin, such as papules, sowda, lichenification, atrophy or depigmentation (O. volvulus), Calabar swellings (L. loa) and lymphedema (W. bancrofti). A suspected diagnosis of filariasis is based on clinical manifestations, history of travel to endemic areas and the presence of eosinophilia. Definitive diagnosis is based on the detection of microfilariae in the blood or skin, as well as the results of biopsy of the nodules. In most cases, treatment is etiological and includes three anthelmintics (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, albendazole), depending on the species identified. Surgical removal of the lesion is only necessary in cases of D. repens infection. Cutaneous gnathostomiasis Gnathostomiasis is a systemic parasitic infection caused principally by Gnathostoma spinigerum, a nematode acquired after ingesting raw or undercooked fish or other foods (snake or frogs) 233-236 . Most cases appear in travelers from Southeast Asia, Central or South America. Cutaneous forms are the most common, although a visceral form (affecting the digestive or central nervous system) is often reported. The characteristic skin symptom is a linear distribution of migratory plaques or nodules, principally on the thorax and upper extremities. It can be differentiated from other linear lesions by the presence of subcutaneous hemorrhages 237 . Eosinophilia is also a characteristic feature, although its absence does not rule out the diagnosis.The definitive diagnosis is difficult and requires the extraction of the worm from the infected tissue. Skin biopsy shows dense dermal and sub-epidermal interstitial and perivascular eosinophilic infiltrates in the form of \"flame figures\" 237 . Immunoblots and immunochromatographic tests are highly sensitive and specific although difficult to obtain 238,239 .

These helminths can also cause folliculitis that does not respond to conventional treatments. It is typically described in travelers returning from the Caribbean, Brazil, South Africa, and Southeast Asia who report visiting beaches and sandy areas and walking barefoot, sitting or lying down on (dry) sand without protection. Humans are accidental hosts; the worm penetrates the unbroken skin and is trapped in the dermis, through which it migrates and eventually dies. After a short incubation period (from hours to days), intensely pruritic, erythematous, edematous, linear eruptions appear, sometimes with vesicles and blisters, distributed in serpiginous tracks as the worm migrates through the skin. The lesions develop in days and, except for eosinophilia (20%), systemic manifestations are rare. Cutaneous larva migrans is a self-limiting disease and the lesions resolve spontaneously within 2-8 weeks, although impetigo due to scratching is frequent.Diagnosis is clinical. Biopsy is not indicated, since the cutaneous lesions correspond to the response to the tracks left by the migrating worm (with eosinophilic infiltrates) without demonstrating the presence of larvae. Epiluminescence microscopy (dermoscopy) has been used to view the larva, although its sensitivity is unknown.Treatment with anthelmintic drugs is useful to relieve symptoms and reduce the probability of bacterial superinfection 251-257 . Oral ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg/day) for 1-2 days is the treatment of choice, with oral albendazole (400 mg/day) for 3-7 days as an alternative, mainly for extensive forms. Topical treatment with thiabendazole (15%) or albendazole (10%) for 10 days is an alternative, although it is difficult to obtain. Neither cryotherapy nor surgery is effective.Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasisCutaneous leishmaniasis encompasses various clinical syndromes caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania that are transmitted to humans and reservoir hosts bitten by infected female phlebotomine sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia in America, and Phlebotomus on the other continents 258-260 . These infections typically appear in young people who have been traveling for more than a month. Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are endemic in more than 70 countries in the worldand Syria) and two in the New World (Brazil and Peru). The number of cases in the countries mentioned has risen in recent years, and other countries have joined the New World group, such as Bolivia and Colombia. Natural disasters, armed conflict (specifically, the war in Afghanistan) and tourism are among the causes of this increase in incidence. Four species cause Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis: L. major, L. tropica, L. aetiopica and L. infantum, while New World cutaneous leishmaniasis is more frequently caused by L. mexicana, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis, L. braziliensis and L. peruviana, with the two latter species producing more serious and complicated mucocutaneous forms. Lesions appear on exposed areas and can be quite different depending on the causative pathogen (e.g. single or multiple nodules, painless ulcers, with or without scab formation, plaques). A simple and rapid technique for diagnosis, although not highly sensitive, is direct microscopic examination of a sample of skin tissue from the active border of the lesion. The most common diagnostic method is histological examination and culture of infected biopsy material in an axenic medium (with improved sensitivity if various samples are obtained and complementary techniques are performed) 261 . Samples should be Giemsa-stained and viewed under the oil immersion objective to detect amastigotes. The two most commonly used axenic culture media are NNN (Novy-McNeal-Nicolle) and Schneider's, with the proper culture temperature between 26 and 28 \u00b0C.

Treatment is symptomatic, possibly involving surgery to remove foreign matter. Primary closure should be evaluated in the case of extensive lesions or in important aesthetic areas. Patients with deep wounds and/or foreign bodies in them should receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Jellyfish stings are relatively frequent and normally take the form of linear or serpiginous lesions on the skin, with edema, petechiae and urticariform reactions. The initial pain feels like a cigarette burn and fades slowly. Treatment of pain caused by Carybdea alata and Physalia spp. stings consists of removing the tentacles as quickly as possible by hand or with seawater, followed by immersion of the affected part in warm water (43-45 \u00b0C) for 20 minutes. Immersion in cold water, vigorous rubbing and topical application of vinegar or ethanol are not recommended.

The clinical diagnosis is quite distinctive in infections by some species. Skin tissue biopsy shows granulomas, sometimes known as \"fishtank granulomas\". An etiological diagnosis is made by stain and culture. Molecular biology techniques or mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) is used for species identification. Most atypical mycobacteria are ubiquitous in the environment, so that isolation should be evaluated on the basis of clinical presentation and histopathology.Standardized treatment regimens are not well established for atypical mycobacteria and are derived from guides used for respiratory complaints285 . An attempt should be made to evaluate sensitivity to different pharmaceutical drugs. It is reasonable to use dual therapy at least (to minimize possible selection for resistance) and to treat for 4-8 weeks after the lesions themselves have healed. For some infections, surgical debridement, as well as antimicrobial treatment, may be useful. Other effective techniques for treating atypical mycobacterial infections affecting the skin are cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, electrodesiccation and local hyperthermia, although their use is not widespread.Buruli ulcer is caused by M. ulcerans and is rarely found in travelers.

Early diagnosis and treatment with ivermectin at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/kg/per day for at least The number of situations that cause immunosuppression has increased in recent decades and include HIV infection, hematological and solid malignancies, transplants, asplenia, and immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments. The immunocompromised traveler requires close attention because of the increased risk of acquiring certain infections or that present in a more severe form[413][414][415] . There are a number of studies on travelers with different types of immune deficiency that give varying data about both the prevalence of infection (36-95%) and the request for pre-travel advice[416][417][418][419][420][421][422] . With respect to pre-travel advice and preventive measures, there are some particular implications for this set of travelers and the following should be avoided: live attenuated vaccines (yellow fever, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and typhoid fever, among others), interactions between drugs (especially between antiretrovirals and antimalarials) and those used to prevent traveler's diarrhea413,423 .In immunocompromised patients, malaria can be more severe; this has been noted basically in patients infected with HIV. In a study of patients diagnosed with imported malaria carried out in France, the percentage of episodes considered serious was higher in patients with HIV infection, compared to those not infected (40% vs 21%), and as high as 51% in those whose CD4+ lymphocyte counts were <350 cells/\u00b5L424 . The diagnosis and treatment of malaria in the immunocompromised patient is similar to that in the immunocompetent individual. Another protozoan infection highly associated with immunosuppression is leishmaniasis. Although it is endemic in our region (Leishmania infantum), it can also be acquired after traveling to other countries. HIV infection is clearly associated with visceral leishmaniasis, increasing the risk of relapse and reducing therapeutic efficacy, although other types of immune deficiency are increasingly being reported associated with this infection, such as transplant patients and those receiving immunosuppressant treatment 425 .
