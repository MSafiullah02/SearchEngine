According to statistics, MP causes up to 40% or more of CAP in children and as many as 18% of cases requiring hospitalization [1]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) was usually a mild and self-limiting disease, and the therapy of macrolides antibiotics for MPP were always effective. It was reported that the incidence of severe or fatal MPP was gradually increasing [2] .The clinical features of severe MPP (SMPP) include large amount of pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive bronchiolitis and even life threatening. Meanwhile, the lingering effects of SMPP include bronchiectasis, atelectasis, obstructive bronchiolitis etc.",

Our previous study showed that children with MPP had significantly higher level of sB7-H3, which was positively correlated with the level of proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1 [5]. Chapoval AI reported that B7-H3 could specifically enhance the production of Th1-type cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) [6].

Demographic and clinical information were collected in all patients including age, gender, duration, duration of fever, length of hospitalization, complications, and medication. Imaging results were conducted using chest radiography, chest CT, and thoracic ultrasound. Laboratory specimens were obtained including peripheral blood, and nasopharyngeal aspirates. The following laboratory tests were conducted including blood routine, C-reactive-protein (CRP), biochemicalfunction, humoral-immunity, and lymphocyte subsets. A total of 26 controls with age matched were selected from children with elective surgery including inguinal hernia, multiple fingers deformity, and fracture fixation after internal fixation from surgery wards of Children\u2019s Hospital of Soochow University. All the controls enrolled in this study without history of infections, drugs allergy, family or personal allergy within 4 weeks. There was no significant difference in the age of children between MPP group and control group.

To our knowledge, the excessive host immunoreactions may play a part in the development of SMPP [14, 15]. This study aim to clarify the the possible mechanism of adaptive immune responses in MPP. In this study, we demonstrated that the costimulatory molecule B7-H3 had an important role in immune-inflammation reaction in MPP through promoting the polarization of Th17.

It was indicated that Th17 cells played a vital role in SMPP [15, 16]. Both antigen or cleavage products of MP could induce high expression of IL-17A in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice [16, 17], and they could stimulate proliferation of mouse lymphocytes and then secrete IL-17A by Th17 cells [4]. Taken together, these studies suggested that Th17 cells and IL-17 played an important role in MPP, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Several studies have shown that MP can stimulate alveolar macrophages produce IL-23, and then IL-23 induces IL-17 production in activated CD4+ T cells. In contrast, blocking of IL-23 alone resulted in a significant reduction of Mp-induced IL-17 in BALF of mice [17, 18]. While the Th17 cell differentiation was engaged by the IL-23 [18, 19],which demostrated the Th17 cell differentiation induced by MP was engaged by the IL-23.",

Co-stimulatory molecules are a heterogenous group of cell surface molecules that act to amplify or counteract the initial activating signals provided to T cells from the T cell receptor (TCR) following its interaction with an antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC), thereby influencing T cell differentiation [19, 20]. Th activation and differentiation is associated with costimulatory molecules expressed on antigen presenting cell including B7 family molecules. Recently, Luo et al. evaluated the functions of B7-H3 in the regulation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, experimental asthma, and collagen-induced arthritis using B7-H3 deficient mouse (B7-H3 KO), it suggested that B7-H3 has function on Th1/Th17 and could enhance IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 production [20, 21]. This is consistent with our findings that B7-H3 plays an role in immunopathogenesis of children with MPP through regulating of Th17 differentiation and enhancing secretion IL-17. In present study, we also demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the levels of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP.",

A previous study indicated that MicroRNA-187, down-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and associated with lower survival, inhibits cell growth and migration though targeting B7-H3 [21, 22]. There are 13 kinds of miRNAs that can target the regulation of B7-H3 in the breast cancer patients, and only miR-29c is associated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients [22, 23]. The aim of our study is to determine the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 expression in children with MPP. The luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The gradual regulation in axis of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 is confirmed in vitro, and the expression of miR-29c, sB7-H3, IL-17 during the acute and convalescent phase is consistent with the result in vitro. The association between sB7-H3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was not statistically significant, but there was related trends. LDH has been confirmed to be associated with the severity of MPP, and LDH is an indicated marker for steroid therapy for MPP [23, 24]. However, there was no association between miR-29c and sB7-H3 in children with MPP, it is probably because there are other miRNAs to regulate B7-H3 expression except for miR-29c [21\u201326]. It is interesting that the serum level of miR-29c expression was negatively correlated with the M. pneumoniae specific IgG and IgM level during the acute phase, which suggested that children with low expression of miR-29c may have an excessive inflammatory immune response to MP infection.
