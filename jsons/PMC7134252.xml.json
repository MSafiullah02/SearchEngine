            "text": "South Africa plans on implementing the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme to provide cost effective access to healthcare for all citizens. Once the scheme is in place, it is believed that the focus of the healthcare industry will shift towards preventative care and health promotion. This would require the industry to become patient-centred. Paper-based filing has major risks such as being vulnerable to damage by elements such as fire and water and medical records being lost [7]. In addition, backups are time and resource intensive and security of paper-based filing is limited to locked storage, with minimal capabilities of logging access to medical records. Various types of electronic records exist, each having a different purpose [13]. For example, an electronic medical record (EMR) typically contains detailed patient encounter information such as an encounter summary, medical history, test results, and allergy details. EMRs are owned and managed by professionals from a single institution. An electronic health record (EHR) is an aggregated collection of a patient\u2019s health information collected from multiple professionals at multiple institutions [19]. It ensures that a patient\u2019s complete medical record is available to an authorised practitioner during patient encounters. No country in Africa has been successful in implementing a nationwide EHR system [21]. EHR and EMR are used interchangeably in the literature but the term EHR is used to refer to all electronic records for health information in this study.",

The security of paper-based filing is limited to locked storage, with minimal capabilities of logging access to medical records. A major issue with paper-based filing is illegibility. Illegibility causes delays in treating patients as time is wasted by trying to understand what is written, contacting the author or redoing the procedure to reproduce the results. The problems associated with paper-based filing are solved with electronic records. Electronic records such as EHR use secure information systems to store and access patient health information and to ensure that the information contained is up-to-date and available when needed [13].",

Despite these challenges, various vendors in SA have attempted to implement their own EHR systems, built on differing architecture which fail to interoperate with each other [21]. Disinterest stems from the belief that measurable benefits (such as finances) are better realised within their own organisation. Thus, to gain the benefits of an EHR system, patients are limited to clinical encounters with organisations that utilise the specific EHR system. This devalues the effectiveness and efficiency of patients managing their own healthcare. The biggest challenge preventing the adoption of EHR systems in the health industry is the resistance from practitioners [22].",

It was indicated by 51% of respondents that time was wasted when having to recount their medical history to all the practitioners that they visited. Surprisingly, those with medical aid are willing to spend up to R100 extra per month to have their health records maintained electronically [13]. Muchangi and Nzuki [24] revealed that patients are not confident in using EMR systems that do not comply with established standards as they fear that their medical confidentiality and security might be compromised. Currently, the SA government lacks legislation and regulations regarding EMR implementation which has led to misuse and poor compliance by organisations [21]. Until the government develops standards for EMR, common guidelines must be followed in developing such systems.",

Blockchain makes use of features (security, stability, fault-tolerance) to allow a network to remain fully functional even if a node has failed [16]. For example, each time a transaction occurs, a transaction request is transmitted to all the nodes, making each node aware of the fact as well as the time the event took place. Nodes then validate the authenticity of the block through a majority consensus and then several transactions are put together into a block. The block is then inserted into the ledger by linking to the last block that was inserted into the ledger. Thus, as blocks are continuously inserted to the ledger, a long series of blocks is formed, hence the term blockchain. Each block is marked with a timestamp and a hash of the previous block, preventing alterations from being made to the previous block [10]. An example of blockchain is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.",

Decentralised systems do not have a central authority. Instead, authority is shared amongst each computer (node), with each of them having equal authority [25]. Distributed systems divide computations into smaller computations to be performed by multiple nodes. Distributed and decentralised systems are highly secure as a central point to attack is lacking. This feature also makes them stable and fault-tolerant. Since each node has equal authority, unethical operations are unlikely to be performed [16]. Blockchain makes use of these features and benefits to allow the network to remain fully functional even if a node has failed.",

AidIT was the only system identified that provides data storage and access and is a mobile EMR system that allows patients to manage their records and facilitates the exchange of these records between patients and practitioners [8]. The AidIT system provides patients with a personal health folder that organises a patient\u2019s data into five separate categories namely: the patient\u2019s personal information (e.g. address, date of birth, photograph and information regarding his/her insurance profile); the patient\u2019s general medical history (e.g. past injuries, chronic conditions, allergies and healthcare encounters); the patient\u2019s past examinations and relevant diagnoses along with ordered lab tests and their results; the patient\u2019s current and past medication prescriptions, along with the quantity and dosage instructions required for each medication; and the patient\u2019s care plan. The patient\u2019s care plan is designed by the patient\u2019s practitioners as a list of actions to be carried out by the patient. AidT\u2019s shortcomings includes non-functionality for tracking and monitoring a patient\u2019s adherence to their medication schedule. In addition, EMR presentation does not indicate what is important and professionals can amend prior medical records which can create inconsistencies.",

A walkthrough evaluation was conducted on both wireframes by an expert reviewer as proposed by [1]. AdobeXD was chosen to prototype the two alternative designs as the software is a free, simple to use platform that allows for designing high fidelity wireframes that can be interacted with to simulate the system\u2019s usage. The feedback received indicated that the first wireframe was too cluttered while the second wireframe had a professional feel and made better use of hand gestures for navigation. The second wireframe design was therefore selected for further development and sample screenshots are shown in Fig. 2. A second walkthrough of the second wireframe was undertaken by a second expert reviewer. The primary feedback received was to limit the viewing of the professionals\u2019 information to only those that have been referred to by one of the professionals in their community. The choice of expert reviewers was because of their availability within short notice as opposed to a typical end-user (patient) and medical practitioner which requires lengthy ethics clearance application and approval.\n",
