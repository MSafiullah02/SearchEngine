We present a bariatric surgery patient who suffered a well-known complication of the RYGB procedure, potentially due to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with high-dose corticosteroids (6). These medications are well-described sources of marginal ulcers, and the high doses likely lead to the patient\u2019s ultimate perforation and peritonitis.",

We believe that laparoscopy should be carefully considered in facilities with laparoscopic air and fluid filtration capacities if the benefit to the patient can be clearly demonstrated. This was key in our decision-making, given that the patient\u2019s respiratory status had deteriorated, and we fully expected the patient to require mechanical ventilation postoperatively. Recent reports [1] of worse postoperative outcomes in COVID-19 patients made us suspect that our patient could eventually require salvage respiratory measures. Proning is currently recommended [7] as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19, and we did not want to impede this with a large midline laparotomy incision. Aside from this, infection and healing of a large incision in the setting of a critically ill, obese patient on high-dose steroid therapy was also a concern.",
