In one study group, persons enrolled online and were sent kits, by rapid-delivery services, for home collection of a midnasal swab; samples were returned by mail. After identification of the first case of Covid-19 in Washington State, the samples that were collected were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. After March 4, 2020, a human subjects institutional review board determined that results could be reported to public health authorities and to participants, who were notified under a public health surveillance exemption.",

Of these, 2353 (66.8%) completed all the study procedures, including testing; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 25 (1.1%), of whom 2 were children (Figure 1A). Enrollment increased markedly in late February, most likely motivated by public concern about Covid-19 (Figure 1A). Some of the collection kits (1316 of 2353 [55.9%]) were sent to participants for same-day delivery, with a median delivery time of 2.3 hours (interquartile range, 1.7 to 3.1). The median number of days from swab collection to receipt of the specimen by the laboratory was 2 days (interquartile range, 2 to 4). Semiquantitative viral loads from home-collected midnasal swabs were stable over time for SARS-CoV-2, other respiratory viruses, and RNase P, a human cellular marker (Figure 1B).",

Looking beyond the current crisis, we envision ubiquitous, community-based sampling for respiratory illnesses as essential infrastructure for early detection and mitigation of future pandemics.",
