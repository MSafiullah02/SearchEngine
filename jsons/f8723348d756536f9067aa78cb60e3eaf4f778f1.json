Therefore, instead of vaccinating, people may prefer to take some self-protective actions including reducing outside activities, detouring to avoid epidemic areas, wearing face masks, washing hands frequently, and so forth [7] [8] [9] [10] .

For instance, people may be laissez-faire to the spreading of common flu, while they will take vaccination for hepatitis B since the vaccines are very effective and hepatitis B is very difficult to be eradicated. In contrast, people prefer to take self-protection against HIV since its consequence is terrible while the effectivity and side effects of vaccines are both unknown. Accordingly, game-theoretic models may be suitable to characterize these decisionmaking processes [3, 4, [11] [12] [13] [14] . Bauch et al. [3, 4] analyzed population behavior under voluntary vaccination policies for childhood diseases via a game-theoretic framework, and they found that voluntary vaccination is unlikely to reach the group-level optimum due to the risk perception in vaccines and the effect of herd immunity. Bauch [11] studied a game model in which individuals adopt strategies according to an imitation dynamics, and found that oscillations in vaccine uptake can emerge under different conditions, for example, vaccinating behavior is very sensitive to the changes in disease prevalence. Vardavas et al. [12] considered the effects of voluntary vaccination on the prevalence of influenza based on a minority game, and found that severe epidemics could not be prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives. Basu et al. [13] proposed an epi-demic game model for HPV vaccination based on the survey data on actual perceptions regarding cervical caner, showing that the actual vaccination level is far lower than the overall vaccination goals. Perisic and Bauch [14] studied the interplay between epidemic spreading dynamics and individual vaccinating behavior on social contact networks. Compared with the homogeneously mixing model, they found that increasing the neighborhood size of the contact network can eliminate the disease if individuals decide whether to vaccinate by accounting for infection risks from neighbors.",

We find a counter-intuitive phenomenon analogous to the well-known Braess's Paradox [15] in network traffic, that is, the increasing of successful rate of self-protection may, on the contrary, decrease the system payoff. We provide a mean-field solution, which well reproduces such observations.

Figure 1 (a) presents the effects of the successful rate of self-protection, \u03b4, on the decision makings of individuals and the epidemic size. Clearly, as the increasing of \u03b4, the condition gets better and better. A counter-intuitive phenomenon is observed when \u03b4 lies in the middle range (from about 0.3 to about 0.4), during which a better condition leads to a larger epidemic size. One may think that though the epidemic size becomes larger, the system payoff (the sum payoff of all individuals) could still get higher since individuals pay less in choosing self-protection than vaccination. However, as shown in figure 1 (b) and 1(c), the system payoff is strongly negatively correlated with the epidemic size. That is to say, a better condition (i.e., a larger \u03b4) could result in worse performance in view of both the larger epidemic size and the less system payoff. This is very similar to the so-called Braess's Paradox, which states that adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route, can in some cases reduce overall performance [15, 21] . When \u03b4 is large, the superiority of self-protection becomes more striking and no one takes vaccination, then the epidemic size decreases as \u03b4 increases. As shown in figure 2(d), self-protective and laissez-faire individuals coexist. As the increasing of \u03b4, though the self-protection strategy is more efficient, the laissez faire strategy is more attractive since the irrelevant individuals becomes more and thus for susceptible individuals, the risk of being infected becomes smaller. This is the reason why the fraction of laissez-faire individuals become more and more in the right range. In fact, when \u03b4 is very large, the laissez-faire and not infected individuals again form a percolating cluster. Please see figure 2(e) for the example case at \u03b4 = 0.95.",

It is because when the successful rate of self-protection increases, people become more speculative and less interested in vaccination. Since a vaccinated individual indeed brings benefit to the system by statistically reducing the infection probability of susceptible individuals, the decreasing of vaccinated individuals will eventually lead to the loss of system payoff. Qualitatively speaking, the counter-intuitive phenomenon is insensitive to the network topology, while quantitatively speaking, networks with delocalized structure (e.g., ER, BA and well-mixed networks) have more self-protective individuals and less laissez-faire individuals than networks with localized structure (e.g., square lattices), and the epidemic size is larger in the latter case. Without the diverse behavioral responses of individuals, epidemic in delocalized structure usually spreads more quickly and widely than in localized structure [31, 32] . The opposite observation reported in the current model again results from more and more speculative choices (i.e., to be laissez-faire) at a low-risky situation.

[33] showed that to remove some specific edges in a network can largely enhance its information throughput, and Youn et al. [34] pointed out that some roads in Boston, New York City and London could be closed to reduce predicted travel times. Actually, Seoul has removed a highway to build up a park, which, beyond all expectations, maintained the same traffic but reduced the travel time [35] . Very recently, Pala et al. [36] showed that Braess's Paradox may occur in mesoscopic electron systems, that is, adding a path for electrons in a nanoscopic network may paradoxically reduce its conductance. This work provides another interesting example analogous to Braess's Paradox, namely a higher successful rate of self-protection may eventually enlarge the epidemic size and thus cause system loss. Let's think of the prisoner's dilemma, if every prisoner stays silent, they will be fine, while one more choice, to betray, makes the situation worse for them. Analogously, if the successful rate \u03b4 is small, few people will choose to be self-protective, while for larger \u03b4, people have more choices, which may eventually reduce the number of vaccinated people and thus enlarge the epidemic size. Basically, both the original Braess's Paradox and the current counter-intuitive phenomenon are partially due to the additional choices to selfish individuals. This is easy to be understood in a simple model like the prisoner's dilemma game, but it is impressive to observe such phenomenon in a complex epidemic game.",

This work raises an unprecedent challenge to the public health agencies about how to lead the population towards an epidemic. The government should take careful consideration on how to distribute their resources and money on popularizing vaccine, hospitalization, self-protection, self-treatment, and so on.",

As shown in figure 2(b), there are only two strategies, vaccination and laissez faire, and thus \u03b4 has no effect on the epidemic size. Both infected and not infected laissez-faire individuals form percolating clusters, and are nearly (not fully) separated by vaccinated individuals. Of course, this kind of partial separation can only be possible when the number of vaccinated individuals is considerable. When \u03b4 gets larger, more and more individuals take self-protection and fewer and fewer individuals take vaccination or laissez faire. Since only a fraction, \u03b4, of self-protective individuals are equivalent to the vaccinated individuals, the system contains more susceptible individuals. In addition, these susceptible individuals are less protected since the number of irrelevant individuals becomes smaller. Such two factors lead to the increase of the epidemic size and the decrease of the system payoff. As shown in figure 2(c), the light-red percolating cluster is fragmented into pieces due to the decrease of irrelevant individuals, which is also a reason of the decrease of the fraction of laissez-faire individuals: being laissez-faire becomes more risky now.",

To explore the impacts of different network structures on the epidemic size and strategy distribution, we compare the results in square lattices (a), ER networks (b), BA networks (c) and well-mixed networks (d). The parameters are set as b = 0.1, I 0 = 5, c = 0.4, and \u03ba = 10. Each data point results from an average over 100 independent runs. The average degrees of the lattices, ER networks and BA networks are all set to be 4, and the simulations presented in subgraph (a), (b) and (c) are implemented with the same transmission and recovery rate, \u03bb = 0.5 and \u00b5 = 0.3. For the well-mixed network (d), however, the parameters are different from others as \u03bb = 0.0013 and \u00b5 = 1 for its different average degree. Delocalization promotes the self-protection strategy. The subgraphs (a)-(d) show how the fractions of the three strategies and the epidemic size change with \u03b4, and subgraphs (e)-(h) are the corresponding snapshots for (a)-(d) with \u03b4 = 0.6. From (a) to (d), the number of randomized edges, A, increases. Qualitatively, the counter-intuitive phenomenon always exists, no matter what the value of A. Quantitatively, the delocalization reduces the advantage of the laissez-faire strategy, which leads to a larger fraction of self-protective individuals. When A is large enough, self-protection becomes the dominating strategy for a certain range of \u03b4. Overall speaking, the epidemic size is smaller at larger A. Parameters are the same as in The analytical solution agrees well with the simulation. The analytical prediction (b) is in good accordance with the simulation (a). All results are implemented on a well-mixed network with N = 1000, c = 0.7, b = 0.1, \u03bb = 0.0013, \u00b5 = 1.0, I 0 = 5 and \u03ba = 10.",
