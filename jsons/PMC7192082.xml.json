The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. As of February 25, 2020, a total of 77785 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in China. A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan City, and then it confirmed as the pathogen of COVID-19 /A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan City, was confirmed as the cause of COVID-192. Now the virus is renamed SARS-CoV-2 by WHO3. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is a unique clade of \u03b2 -coronal viruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)2. Like other \u03b2 coronaviruses\u2019, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5\u2032 end, followed by four major structural proteins, including the spike surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein4. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to coronavirus in bats, which are presumed to be the main source5. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation, current evidence suggests that it spread to humans through wild animals sold illegally in the South China.",

The patient's clinical manifestations include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased white blood cell count, and imaging evidence of pneumonia7. However, no difference in clinical characteristics have been reported between Wuhan and other cities in China. Case reports confirm human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2\n8. Currently, there is no effective First Screening and diagnosis Guide for COVID-19 in Non-Wuhan areas. Therefore, if the Hunan hospital adopts clinical COVID-19 diagnosis measures similar to Hubei area, it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate because of the lighter early clinical symptoms, slighter respiratory damage and the lower positive rate of imaging results.",

By comparing the Hunan\u2019s data with Wuhan\u2019s (the area with the most severe outbreak of COVID-19 in China), we found that the clinical symptoms of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hunan were significantly different from those in Wuhan. The fever rate of newly diagnosed patients in Hunan area is lower and the temperature of most patients is below 39 \u2103 (94%). Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 did not cough in the early stages of infection. It is worth noting that patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Hunan rarely have difficulty breathing at first diagnosis, only with slight shortness of breath or chest tightness.

Most patients presented with fever, but hardly accompanied with dyspnea/Most patients are accompanied by fever instead of the symptoms of dyspnea, which is significantly different from the clinical symptoms of patients in Wuhan. This may be rare related to the second-generation infection of the virus outside Wuhan. In an early report in Wuhan, China, 2-10% of COVID-19 patients developed symptoms of diarrhea. Such patients are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). And there are related studies showing that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be faecal-oral. In our study, it was found that patients outside Hubei may have up to 15% of their first symptoms as diarrhea. It is worth mentioning that more patients in Hunan suffer from the diarrhea, and the stool nucleic acid positive rate is higher. All of the above phenomenon may be related to regional differences. Therefore, every doctor needs to be alert to such a phenomenon, whether to perform SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection on diarrhea patients instead of only those patients with flu symptoms. Such findings have more positive significance for the global prevention and control of COVID-19.",
