Biobanks can also host prospective cohorts or material related to clinical trials. Amount and structure of collected data in clinical collections is determined by the specifics of the particular healthcare systems\u2014typically based on the hospital information systems\u2014for potentially large numbers of patients, especially when these are handled by the healthcare during pandemics.

Achieving these objectives will substantially support further research into COVID-19, and hence it is key to connect early and effectively in a multidisciplinary manner with other key facilitators of medical research, such as the research infrastructures ECRIN (multinational clinical trials) and EATRIS (translational medicine)2 or the broader community of research infrastructures, which already mobilized considerable resources across all scientific clusters.3",

The Directory data model is based on MIABIS Core 2.0 [3] with the concept of biobanks (institutions) and collections (of data and samples) and it has been extended with COVID-relevant attributes as shown in Table 1. Existing collections of COVID-positive samples will be marked with respective ICD-10 codes and COVID-specific collection attributes. Prospective collections can be advertised as empty collections with COVID-specific collection attributes defining what data can be collected. The metadata descriptors were initially collected by BBMRI-ERIC\u2019s National Nodes (represented throughout 21 member states),6 and now the Directory is ready to accept updates via National Nodes or via the BBMRI-ERIC Helpdesk.7 The Directory data model is being continuously optimized based on the feedback from and needs of the research and biobanking communities. The model is also being deployed in national nodes to collect the relevant information, using the underlying MOLGENIS platform [4] to quickly configure locally needed extensions. In order to maximize findability, the Directory also serves as a data source for aggregation services such as FAIRSharing.org and Google dataset search.",

            "text": "Collection of quality biological material from patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 might be a challenge due to infection risk related to the procedures performed on different types of biospecimen. In most cases, samples collected from upper respiratory tract (swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) seem to be associated with the highest risk due to the content of active virus when compared with the whole blood and blood derivatives [5]. In addition, assessment of the virus load in such samples collected from asymptomatic individuals and those who show typical COVID-19 symptoms, showed no statistically significant difference with the highest viral load at the presentation [6]. Stool samples, collected by many biobanks, are also amongst highly infectious material in contrast to serum and plasma [5, 7]. Safety measures for fractionation and storage of urine samples should be also performed due to inconsistent data on viral load, indicating that urine might be potentially infectious [8] but this stays in contrast with other reports [5]. While the most current publications are a valuable source of the latest knowledge, they might also provide conflicting advice and limited data. Laboratories performing work on biological specimens should thus strictly follow well-established guidelines such as those published by WHO,11 ECDC,12 as well as local epidemiological surveillance. According to these recommendations the individual risk assessment is becoming a key step before starting the work with SARS-CoV-2 suspected samples in order to decide whether sample processing requires BSL-3 or BSL-2 standard. High virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of suitable equipment in many facilities, indicates the possibility of taking steps that minimize contact with potentially infectious material. It is essential to establish the flow of biological material between clinical laboratories and biobanks that will perform the minimum steps associated with the processing of biological material and will be responsible for its safe storage until release\u2014such as guidelines established by Czech National Node of BBMRI-ERIC [9]. In response to the needs of the biobanking community, BBMRI-ERIC organized a series of online meetings with clinical and laboratory experts and provided the access to guidelines enabling the preparation of biobanks for working with samples obtained from COVID-19 patients13. International standards on risk management and safety, such as ISO 20387:2018, 31000:2018, 31004:2013, and 15190:2020, should be also followed when applicable.",
