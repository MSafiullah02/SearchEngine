Most of the vaccines in current use were empirically developed during the last century. Today, due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering, the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible. Moreover, live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors. In each case, the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated. A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far. In many cases, further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles. In the present chapter, we focus on current strategies which are employed for the development of new and the optimization of first generation recombinant live vaccines based on bacteria and viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Vaccination with live attenuated pathogenic viruses has a long tradition, although few people are aware of this. Already in the fifth century AD, variolation, the vaccination against smallpox virus with material from pustules of infected people, was practiced in China and later in India as well as in Japan and Europe (Mazumdar 2003) . The material was applied intradermally or nasally. At a pending smallpox epidemic, even the grandchildren of George I, king of England, were variolated after rudimentary safety and efficacy trials using death-sentenced prisoners and orphans for testing. Although highly protective, variolation never reached general compliance in the Western world partly because a certain death toll had to be paid using this method. It was not before the groundbreaking experiment by Edward Jenner in 1796 that vaccination was generally accepted. Jenner prevented smallpox disease in a 13-year-old boy by preinoculation with cowpox virus and established convincingly the principle of immunization by the use of active agents, at this time without knowledge about the nature of the immunogen or the immune system. Following the discovery of pathogenic bacteria, Louis Pasteur pioneered the development of several vaccines. In 1879, he generated the first live attenuated bacterial vaccine by extended culture of fowl cholera bacteria, which could be applied to chicken without causing disease but preventing them from infection with a virulent strain (Pasteur 1880) . This discovery marks the starting point for the development of live attenuated vaccines (LAV) . Within the next 20 years at the end of the nineteenth century, a number of further vaccines quickly appeared, for example, anthrax and rabies vaccines developed by Pasteur or human vaccines against typhoid fever, cholera, and plague (Makela 2000) . Since then, many LAV for human and animal use were developed until today, including live attenuated bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Such vaccines continue to have a tremendous impact in the prevention of infectious diseases despite a number of other vaccine classes have been introduced over time. This reflects unique characteristics of LAV, which are unmet by other vaccines thus far with respect to the induction of protective immune responses against specific pathogens (Table 5 .1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 334, "text": "(Mazumdar 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1486, "text": "(Pasteur 1880)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1582, "text": "(LAV)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1831, "text": "(Makela 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2317, "end": 2325, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "One of the hallmarks of LAV is that they efficiently target immune inductive sites during their limited infection cycle in the host.

This paved the way for rational attenuation of LAV, rendering them nonpathogenic even in the absence of a functional host immune system and inert to changes in diet, commensal flora, or other individual traits. In addition, the use of LAV as delivery systems for foreign antigens derived from other pathogens or therapeutic molecules is now possible. Meanwhile, a considerable number of such recombinant LAV advanced into clinical testing or even have obtained marketing authorization. Notably, most approved recombinant LAV thus far are veterinary vaccines (Meeusen et al. 2007 ). However, the rapidly expanding knowledge about host-microbe interactions and recent technological advances, such as genome sequencing, global expression analysis techniques, as well as high end gene synthesis, will open up completely new ways to rationally design LAV as such or for recombinant vaccine delivery. Eventually, it will be possible to develop a new generation of LAV tailored for specific applications with an excellent safety and efficacy profile. Thus, harnessing the potential of LAV to induce all arms of the immune system, these vaccines probably will provide new options in the fight against major threads to human and animal health. Depending on the vector system of choice, \"vaccine cargo\" of different nature, size, and amount can be delivered. Whereas viral vaccine vectors in most cases will carry the genetic information of foreign antigens in order to mediate their expression in the host cells, other microbial vector systems offer more flexibility with respect to delivery and release of foreign antigens.

Various serovars of Salmonella enterica are causative agents of either enteritis or septicemia in animals. In turn, contaminated animal-derived food products are the main sources for human Salmonella infections (Barrow 2007) . Attenuated Salmonella vaccine strains established by chemical mutagenesis have been introduced into veterinary practice in the 1970s and are often in use until today (Linde et al. 1974; Meyer et al. 1993) . Directed attenuation by genetic engineering became feasible in the 1980s. A number of suitable gene targets were identified, belonging mainly to metabolic pathways, regulatory systems, or virulence determinants. Interference with synthesis of aromatic amino acids by deletion of gene aroA (encoding 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase) proved to be an excellent strategy for safe attenuation while retaining immunogenicity of a S. typhimurium strain (Hoiseth and Stocker 1981) . This concept was subsequently transferred for attenuation to a number of other bacteria, such as Aeromonas salmonicida (Vaughan et al. 1993) , Yersinia enterocolitica (Bowe et al. 1989) , Pasteurella multocida (Homchampa et al. 1992) , Escherichia coli (Fan et al. 2004) , and Streptococcus equi (Jacobs et al. 2000) , of which several strains were successfully commercialized as LAV for animal use. As a strategy to reduce the likelihood of virulence reversion, e.g., due to unwanted acquisition of complementing DNA sequences, attenuation of multiple genes was proposed.

In accordance, the so-called strategy of regulated delayed attenuation was established recently in order to circumvent this problem (Curtiss III et al. 2009 ). Here, the vaccine strain is designed in a way that the invasive phenotype of the strain is retained during the initial phase of vaccination until immune inductive sites have been colonized. Subsequently, due to the lack of a particular substrate in vivo, the invasive phenotype of bacteria fades before acute disease is elicited. Proof of concept was established with mutant strains lacking either genes galE or pmi (phosphomannose isomerase) (Curtiss III et al. 2010) . Such mutants are attenuated due to the lack of functional lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, when grown in the presence of either galactose or mannose, respectively, these mutants synthesize LPS and are able to colonize host tissue upon oral administration.

In addition, the understanding of LAV interaction with the host immune system has greatly advanced (Kaufmann 2007) . This is an excellent basis for the development of a next generation of bacterial LAV. Existing vaccines will eventually be replaced by refined strains, in which, in addition to defined attenuation, a number of other features are rationally designed like modulated expression of immunogenic components (Fig. 5.1) . Furthermore, recombinant DNA technology provides the possibility to program such strains at the same time as delivery system for foreign antigens, nucleic acid-based vaccines, or therapeutic molecules ( Fig. 5.1) . By now, a wide range of bacteria are explored for these purposes. In this case, distinct properties of bacterial species can be harnessed or diverted depending on the specific needs for the spectrum of medical applications (Fig. 5.2 ). Nonpathogenic bacteria such as food-derived or commensal lactic acid bacteria are attractive for the delivery of vaccines and therapeutics especially via the mucosa because they are considered of being generally safe (Wells and Mercenier 2008) . In contrast to invasive attenuated bacteria, they do not actively enter and replicate inside host cells. Therefore, release of heterologous antigens from such bacteria occurs primarily in the extracellular space ( Fig. 5.2a ). In accordance, they mainly stimulate induction of antibody responses in several vaccination models. However, extracellular LAV can also be engineered to directly inject heterologous antigens into the Next-generation bacterial LAV for vaccine delivery. The development of a new bacterial LAV for the delivery of a specific vaccine is a complex and individual process for each application. First, a suitable bacterial carrier strain has to be selected and to be attenuated in a defined manner (red symbols). In order to potentiate vector-directed immune responses (if intended) or to provide optimal adjuvant activity components of the strain can be modulated (blue symbols). Examples for modulation could be overexpression of immunogenic surface proteins or the removal of anti-apoptotic genes from the carrier strain in order to strengthen cross-priming. The synthesis and delivery of heterologous protein and/or nucleic acids requires precise programming of the vaccine strain (green symbols). Expression cassettes are either located on plasmids or integrated into the chromosome. Expression determinants and coding sequences can be optimized. Finally, release and transfer of vaccine components from bacteria to the immune cells can either be achieved by secretion or bacterial disintegration host cell cytosol in order to induce cytotoxic T-cell responses ( Fig. 5.2a) . This was first demonstrated by employing an extracellular Yersinia pseudotuberculosis carrier strain mediating the cytosolic delivery of listeriolysin O (LLO), a protective antigen of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), via its type III secretion apparatus (Russmann et al. 2003) . More often, recombinant LAV have been derived from bacteria capable of invading host cells, such as Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes, or Shigella flexneri (Curtiss III 2002; Kotton and Hohmann 2004) . In case of Salmonella, subsequent to cellular invasion, bacteria reside naturally inside a phagosome. They subvert this compartment into a protected niche for proliferation. Presentation of heterologous antigens expressed by attenuated Salmonella that undergo disintegration in this compartment is therefore restricted mainly to the MHC-II pathway leading to CD4 T-cell activation ( Fig. 5.2b ). In contrast, L. monocytogenes or Shigella flexneri escape the vacuolar compartment soon after cellular uptake and replicate inside the cytosol. Thus, upon carrier disintegration, vaccine cargo can be directly released into the cytoplasm (Fig. 5.2c ). This allows presentation of heterologous antigens via MHC-I molecules to CD8 T-cells. However, the great advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms, which lead to a particular bacterial function such as host cell invasion, Antigens can either be released outside the host cell or delivered into the host cell cytoplasm, e.g., by a type III secretion system. (b) Delivery of heterologous antigens from bacteria which are restricted to an intracellular vacuole, e.g., Salmonella. Antigens can either be targeted to the vacuole or to the cytosol. (c) Bacteria capable of vacuolar escape can deliver heterologous antigen directly to the cytoplasm of the host cell upon degradation or by secretion intracellular residence, etc., will allow more and more to interchange the underlying molecular systems between bacterial species in order to tailor bacterial LAV precisely for specific applications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 201, "text": "(Kaufmann 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1212, "text": "(Wells and Mercenier 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3102, "text": "(Russmann et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 3261, "end": 3279, "text": "(Curtiss III 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3280, "end": 3304, "text": "Kotton and Hohmann 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 515, "text": "(Fig. 5.1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 721, "end": 730, "text": "Fig. 5.1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 956, "end": 965, "text": "(Fig. 5.2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1438, "text": "Fig. 5.2a", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2803, "end": 2813, "text": "Fig. 5.2a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3690, "end": 3699, "text": "Fig. 5.2b", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3940, "end": 3950, "text": "(Fig. 5.2c", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Recombinant Bacterial LAV for Vaccine Delivery"}, {"text": "In the present chapter, we will focus especially on Salmonella vaccine vectors in order to exemplify major improvement strategies for the development of bacterial LAV in general.

Thus, long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses have been induced against a wide spectrum of antigens delivered by Salmonella LAV (Galen et al. 2009; Kwon et al. 2007; Moreno et al. 2010) . In addition to the selection of a suitable vector strain which meets the balance between immunogenicity and safety (as discussed before), the strategy of heterologous antigen synthesis and delivery has to be carefully considered for each antigen and the anticipated immune response (Galen and Levine 2001; Kotton and Hohmann 2004) .

Therefore, strong constitutive promoters were used initially for the expression of heterologous antigens by bacterial LAV (Brown et al. 1987 ). However, even when achieved at all, such high-level expression of antigen often constitutes a serious burden for the vaccine strain, which reduces its ability of tissue colonization and to induce immune responses. As a solution to this problem, the use of in vivo inducible (IVI) promoters was proposed which are derived from genes that become activated under conditions encountered at certain stages of the colonization course. At first, the nitrite reductase promoter (P nirB ) of E. coli was employed which is induced by intestinal hypoxia (Chatfield et al. 1992a ). Subsequently, a number of additional IVI promoters were tested for the expression of heterologous antigens (Hohmann et al. 1995; Stratford et al. 2005; Valdivia and Falkow 1997) . Each individual promoter differs in the timing and level of antigen expression and consequently influences the antigen-specific immune induction (Bumann 2001 ). An alternative approach was developed in the Curtiss lab which was named \"regulated delayed synthesis of antigens\" (Xin et al. 2008) . Here, antigen production is retarded due to the arabinose-dependent expression of a repressor protein driven by the P BAD promoter in vitro (Guzman et al. 1995) . Upon vaccine administration, the repressor expression ceases due to the lack of arabinose in the gastrointestinal tract of the mice, thus relieving the repressor blockade of the antigen expression cassette. For both strategies, the use of IVI promoters or the employment of a regulated delayed synthesis system, the time point of antigen synthesis and the expression level is fixed and cannot be tuned during vaccination. We therefore have recently tested the suitability of substrate-inducible promoters for the deliberate onset and adjustment of reporter gene expression by bacterial LAV in vivo . Such promoters constitute a new option for inducible antigen expression in a controlled manner in vivo, a concept that was termed \"in vivo remote control\" (IVRC).

The main advantage of plasmids is that they can be easily manipulated in E. coli and subsequently transferred into vaccine strains. In addition, multicopy plasmids mediate elevated levels of antigen synthesis in comparison to single-copy chromosomal expression cassettes. However, episomal plasmid replication constitutes a metabolic burden for bacteria, thus further attenuating the vaccine strain (Covone et al. 1998 ). Moreover, plasmid maintenance is often achieved by antibiotic selection in vitro. In the absence of this selective pressure in vivo, plasmids are often lost from the proliferating bacteria. In order to ensure stability of the plasmid transformants without the need of antibiotic selection, so-called balanced lethal systems have been established (Curtiss III et al. 1990 ). Such systems rely on host strains with a chromosomal deletion of an essential metabolic gene. The defect of this gene is complemented on the expression plasmid, therefore ensuring stable plasmid propagation.

Since requirements for protective immune responses against pathogens differ, targeting of heterologous antigens into different presentation pathways is necessary. Thus, the choice of the right attenuated vaccine strain is important to accomplish such efficient targeting. Heterologous antigens synthesized by bacterial LAV have to be released from the bacteria in order to be recognized by immune cells. Gram-negative bacteria lacking gene asd encoding the aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase undergo cell death in environments lacking diaminopimelic acid (DAP). Since DAP is absent in the gastrointestinal tract, orally applied bacteria deficient of asd quickly lyse in vivo (Curtiss III 1978) . During DAP-less death, the bacterial cell wall spontaneously bursts, and cytoplasmic cellular contents such as protein and nucleic acids are efficiently released (Loessner et al. 2006) . In contrast, other lethal attenuations, such as deficiency of thyA (thymidylate synthase) in thymine or thymidine-deprived environments, do not cause rupture of the bacterial cell, and therefore, no immediate release of cytoplasmic material occurs. Hence, subsequent slow degradation of bacterial carcasses may prevent release and presentation of heterologous antigen. As alternative to strain attenuation, inducible lysis systems have been developed which mediate efficient release of cytoplasmic antigen or nucleic acid from ruptured bacterial cells. For instance, bacteriophage lysis determinants have been employed for this purpose (Jain and Mekalanos 2000) . The use of lysis protein E derived from phage phiX174 has already been employed for some time to prepare bacterial cell envelopes devoid of cytoplasmic content to be used for vaccination, so-called bacterial ghosts (Jalava et al. 2003) . The employment of such lysis determinants for the release of heterologous antigens from a bacterial vector strain necessitates its tightly regulated inducible expression in vivo. This was achieved by linking lysis gene E to the arabinose-inducible P BAD promoter, suitable for IVRC (see above) , or more recently to quorum sensing or iron-regulated promoters (Guan et al. 2011; Silva et al. 2010 ).

Meanwhile, bacteria-mediated transfer of plasmid DNA encoding vaccine antigens or therapeutic molecules was demonstrated in experimental animal models of infectious diseases, tumors, and gene deficiencies (Becker et al. 2008; Daudel et al. 2007; Loessner and Weiss 2004) . Bacteria, competent to access the host cell cytoplasm, have been observed to display the highest transfer efficiency for nucleic acids (Courvalin et al. 1995; Dietrich et al. 1998; Sizemore et al. 1995) . However, bacteria restricted to an intracellular vacuolar compartment such as Salmonella are also capable to mediate DNA transfer to a certain extent by an unknown mechanism (Darji et al. 1997) . The use of an S. typhimurium strain lacking ssrAB, two essential genes for maintenance of phagosomal integrity during intracellular growth, improved the DNA delivery capacity of the vaccine strain (Bai et al. 2011 ). In addition, extracellular bacteria can mediate DNA delivery into mammalian cells by a conjugational apparatus (Kunik et al. 2001; Waters 2001) . In comparison to other DNA delivery systems, bacterial vectors have a nearly unlimited capacity with regard to size. For instance, infectious virus could be reconstituted by the delivery of the complete genome of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by a Salmonella vaccine strain into mammalian cells (Cicin-Sain et al. 2003 ). Specific silencing of mammalian genes was achieved with an engineered E. coli strain which could mediate the delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Xiang et al. 2006 ). However, several bottlenecks have been identified which counteract the bacterial delivery of nucleic acids into mammalian cells. Cellular defense mechanisms such as autophagy (Ogawa et al. 2005) , bacteria-induced cellular activation, or cell death (Fink and Cookson 2007) are factors that can restrict transfer efficiency.

Toxic agents are another possibility to enhance anticancer effects of bacteria. For instance, the bacterial toxin cytolysin A resulted in strong reduction of tumor growth when expressed by tumor-colonizing S. typhimurium (Nguyen et al. 2010; Ryan et al. 2009) . A third class of molecules are so-called prodrug-converting enzymes that convert nontoxic prodrugs into toxic substances. For example, thymidine kinase of the herpes simplex virus or E. coli cytosine deaminase has been used in this context (King et al. 2002; Nemunaitis et al. 2003; Pawelek et al. 1997; Royo et al. 2007 ). Tumor therapeutic bacteria mediating delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids for therapeutic factors or interfering RNA species are also in development. In tumor therapeutic approaches, the use of proteins like thrombospondin-1, endostatin, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligand, but also the E. coli prodrug-converting enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase or apoptosisinducing proteins (TRAIL and Smac), led to efficient treatment of various tumors in mice (Fu et al. 2008a, b, c; Lee et al. 2004 Lee et al. , 2005 Yoon et al. 2007) . Similarly, siRNAs on eukaryotic plasmids targeting Stat-3 or the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 showed their potential to be used in the treatment of tumors. Although promising, the mechanism leading to the effect is unclear. Salmonella are only rarely found inside of tumor cells or other host cells (Agorio et al. 2007; Pawelek et al. 1997) . Therefore, the question which cells can be the target for gene transfer still has to be answered. When constructing an efficacious anticancer bacterium, the regulation of therapeutic molecule expression is crucial. The use of particular promoters allows to predetermine the exact onset of therapeutic treatment as well as its termination, e.g., via the expression of suicide genes ). Therefore, inducible promoters like the P BAD promoter mentioned before enable to start the expression upon administration of the inducer substance at any desired time point ). Furthermore, tumor-specific promoters that exclusively drive protein expression inside of the neoplasia but not in any other tissue of the host are an important aspect to avoid side effects on healthy organs (Arrach et al. 2010; Leschner et al. 2011 ). Bacteria-mediated tumor therapy is often met with skepticisms despite the undisputed success in experimental and preclinical models. Although it will still require many iterative steps until it is converted into a general applicable therapeutic strategy, it undoubtedly has great potential.

Since they were all developed at a time when knowledge about the virus genomes and mechanisms of virulence were still lacking, mutagenesis of viruses was relatively random. In the past, attenuation of a virus was achieved by passaging in embryonated eggs or in animals of different vertebrate species followed by cell culture adaption. Later, with the establishment of standardized cell culture techniques, live virus vaccines were propagated in primary cells like chicken embryonic fibroblasts and human diploid cell lines (e.g., MRC-5) which have a definite life span. To facilitate the process of vaccine production, these cells are now successively being replaced by continuous cell lines (CCLs) due to improved characterization of these cells and widened analytical technologies able to determine their possible oncogenic potential. Thus far, only a small number of human vaccines are produced in CCLs (Gregersen et al. 2011 ). The African green monkey kidney cell line Vero is now the most widely accepted CCL by regulatory authorities and has been used for over 30 years for the production of polio and rabies virus vaccines (Barrett et al. 2009 ).

Thus far, polio is eliminated from most parts of the world. Some European countries claim the eradication of measles virus. These achievements were possible because these viruses are restricted to the human host and do not persist in an animal reservoir. In addition, only one viral serotype (variola, mumps, measles, rubella) or very few serotypes (polio) exist.

Hence, efforts of politics and health care professionals on the one hand and also the development of new vaccines are necessary in order to achieve the goal of global eradication of such viruses.

However, worldwide, approximately 200,000 children die of measles each year. Immune responses induced by routine vaccination represent a problem for the use of recombinant measles vector vaccines. On the other hand, the extensive clinical experience with the adapted measles vaccines, their rare side effects, and their capacity to induce a strong often lifelong immunity renders measles virus highly suitable as a vaccine vector. To use a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus (Mononegavirales) as vector is possible nowadays by state-of-the-art molecular methods to produce cDNA clones. These technologies allow site-directed mutagenesis to study gene functions as well as to insert foreign coding sequences to develop multivalent vaccines against measles and other pathogens. The use of measles virus as vector was experimentally promoted by its high genetic stability, which is unexpected for RNA viruses, and by its acceptance of foreign sequences. For quite a while, it was not possible to convert measles virus into a vaccine vector, but in the meantime, appropriate replicons, helper cells, and helper viruses were constructed (Collins et al. 1993 (Collins et al. , 1991 Conzelmann and Schnell 1994; Martin et al. 2006; Schneider et al. 1997; Sidhu et al. 1995; Takeda et al. 2005) .

The original yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated virus based on the 17D yellow fever virus strain (YFV-17D). It was developed almost 70 years ago by empirical methods and is still considered to be one of the safest and most effective virus vaccines.

Viruses of this family infect both humans and animals. Adenoviruses are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses assembled from a nucleocapsid that harbors the double-stranded linear DNA genome. There are 53 serotypes of adenoviruses in humans with variable morphology (Kaufman 2011) . The virus is responsible for 5-10% of ocular, respiratory, or gastrointestinal epithelium infections in children and also adults. Already in 1977, a cell line was established that enabled the production of recombinant adenoviruses in a helper-free environment. Since this landmark, adenoviral vectors have received attention as gene transfer agents for gene therapy and for vector-based vaccinations (Randrianarison-Jewtoukoff and Perricaudet 1995) . Attenuation is usually achieved by deleting the E1A gene that is known to be essential for adenoviral replication (Carlock and Jones 1981; Gaynor and Berk 1983) . The DE1A vectors are able to infect cells without causing any cellular damage. In the first vector generation, E1 and E3 were deleted (DE1/E3) because the E3 region is not essential for in vitro vector production. The adenovirus vector is able to deliver genes with nearly 100% efficiency to a wide range of cell types including dividing or nondividing cells as well as primary cells, and it is possible to produce extremely high viral titers. Adenoviral vectors provide a capacity of up to 8 kb of foreign recombinant genes. In the classical adenovirus vector generation, the recombinant genes are inserted into the deleted E1A region of a viral cDNA by in vitro ligation and homologous recombination protocols (Wolff and Lederberg 1994) . A new approach allows the generation of recombinant adenoviruses by Tn7mediated transposition in E. coli (Richards et al. 2000) . For the viral production, normally modified 293 cells are utilized. These cells are stably transfected with the E1A region of the adenoviral genome and allow the vector to replicate and mature. The resulting vector particle prepared from this cell line will lack the E1A region and remain replication deficient. As with any viral vector system, it has to be ensured that the produced vector is not contaminated with the wild-type virus. In the adenoviral system, two homologous recombination events must occur to restore wild-type virus rendering this event highly unlikely.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 329, "text": "(Kaufman 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 732, "end": 780, "text": "(Randrianarison-Jewtoukoff and Perricaudet 1995)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 897, "end": 921, "text": "(Carlock and Jones 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 922, "end": 943, "text": "Gaynor and Berk 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1684, "text": "(Wolff and Lederberg 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1814, "text": "(Richards et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Adenovirus vectors strongly induce the innate arm of the immune system that results in inflammation of infected tissues and efficient clearance of administered vectors (Muruve 2004) .

VLPs of HBsAg derived from HBV were already described over 40 years ago from infected patient sera (Bayer et al. 1968 ).

At that time, there was no knowledge on virus infections, immune responses, and the correlate to tumor regression, and therefore, the use of oncolytic viruses today demands the investigation of those parameters. Reovirus, vaccinia, measles, adeno, herpes, vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as Newcastle disease virus, are the viruses mainly considered for therapies of cancer by oncolysis. The first approved oncolytic virus H101 has been approved in 2005 in China but not in Europe or the USA (Kirn 2006) . It is a DE1B adenovirus variant. For the improvement of safety, i.e., the tumor-specific infection and replication as well as efficacy, i.e., destruction of the tumor and eventually also metastases, it is essential to understand viral tropism and host restriction in addition to the influence of the molecular phenotype of the tumor. Techniques to specifically modify viruses for a rational design and the development of safe and efficient oncolytic viruses are already available. For instance, retargeting through modification of viral envelope proteins or their substitutions as well as activation or restriction of viral replications through specific viral gene deletions are necessary to generate safe and tumor-specific viruses. In addition, arming and shielding oncolytic viruses will improve oncolytic efficacy. Arming refers to equipping the virus with genes encoding prodrug-converting enzymes or immune stimulatory proteins to enhance antitumor activity.

Various mouse models are often used to establish first proof of concept for a new vaccine in vivo with regard to its safety and efficacy. Since pathogen-host interaction differs between mouse and human, careful selection of the pathogen for challenge experiments and the appropriate mouse strain (or an alternative animal model) is necessary in order to obtain relevant data. For example, in the case of efficacy testing of poxvirus vaccines, the most common challenge model uses the lab-adapted VACV strain Western Reserve in mice. Even though special safety equipment is demanded for work with ectromelia virus, however, as the natural mouse pathogen causing mousepox, this virus resembles much more the course of disease progression of a variola virus in humans than the Western Reserve strain. To define the best route of challenge, virus administration is also important. Besides footpad inoculation, intranasal infection appears to mimic a more natural route of poxvirus infection. Thus, this virusanimal model represents an optimal small animal model to study MVA and orthopoxvirus immunogenicity and vaccine success ). Other viruses, e.g., HIV, measles virus, and Ebola virus, cannot infect or replicate in mice due to strict host specificity. For such viruses, other target animals such as monkeys are needed. In the case of HIV, infection of macaques with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is still an important animal model for the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and the development of novel HIV vaccines. A natural SIV variant defective in the Nef gene function was found to induce protective immunity against an SIV challenge and thus can provide a valid tool to study the immune parameters that confer protection against the challenge virus (Daniel et al. 1992 ). However, due to ethical concerns and high costs, low numbers of animals can be used in experimental settings. An alternative attempt is made to develop new mouse strains transgenic for human components. For example, a mouse transgenic for the human SLAM receptor enabled measles virus infection and replication in otherwise resistant mice (Ohno et al. 2007 ). Additionally, immunogenic parameters that would also be representative for humans cannot always be found in animal models. Therefore, so-called humanized mice are developed which lack parts of their own immune system and thus can be reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells from which functional human immune cells can develop (Legrand et al. 2009 ). Similarly, humanized mice have been successfully tested in infection experiments using S. typhi, a bacterial pathogen that is exclusively restricted to humans (Song et al. 2010) .

The development of a new bacterial LAV for the delivery of a specific vaccine is a complex and individual process for each application. First, a suitable bacterial carrier strain has to be selected and to be attenuated in a defined manner (red symbols). In order to potentiate vector-directed immune responses (if intended) or to provide optimal adjuvant activity components of the strain can be modulated (blue symbols). Examples for modulation could be overexpression of immunogenic surface proteins or the removal of anti-apoptotic genes from the carrier strain in order to strengthen cross-priming. The synthesis and delivery of heterologous protein and/or nucleic acids requires precise programming of the vaccine strain (green symbols). Expression cassettes are either located on plasmids or integrated into the chromosome. Expression determinants and coding sequences can be optimized.
