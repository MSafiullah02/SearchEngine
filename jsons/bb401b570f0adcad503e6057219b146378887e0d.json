Both species are univoltine and breed in the spring. The populations of adult H. brevipalpis are largest during the summer when great numbers emerge and migrate. Very few H. sirigifrons adults emerge before spring. Its adult populations are largest in the spring, and small numbers of mature individuals fly with mature //. brevipalpis specimens. This is discussed in relation to their habitat utilization: H. strigifrons inhabits permanent waters only and is dimorphic for flight musculature; //. brevipalpis inhabits both permanent and ephemeral waters and is always equipped with a functioning flight apparatus. H. brevipalpis is an effective colonizer of ephemeral waters due to its large dispersal capacity and to the fact that the habitat of juveniles differs from that of adults. Age, sexual maturation and feeding in flying and non-flying groups are compared. Food is seldom found in the gut of fliers of either species. In the spring flying H. brevipalpis females have larger oocytes than non-flying ones; flying H. sirigifrons females have smaller oocytes than non-fliers. It is possible that the summer migrations of//, brevipalpis favour outbreeding since fliers are sexually immature; spring fliers, being sexually mature, are more efficient as colonizers.",

The reason for this is that a single mated or parthenogenetically reproducing female may suffice to colonize a habitat. Johnson's concept \"the oogenesis flight syndrome\" (Johnson 1969, point (a) above) originally refers only to females. Dingle (1974) proposed the expression \"reproduction flight syndrome\" to include males, and I will use his expression. If, for example, males with immature testes migrate and mate with females from other populations, outbreeding will be promoted. Greater importance should therefore be attached to the role of males in the process of migration and colonization.",

Its flight period lasts from the latter part of April until October or sometimes even the beginning of November. The largest numbers of fliers occur during June and July. The fact that the flight period for H. orienialis is much longer than that for H. brevipalpis is probably due to the differences in climate between Waterioo, Canada and the Swedish regions. The mean annual temperature in Montreal (near Waterloo) is 6.7\u00b0C, in Stockholm, it is 6.6\u00b0C. However, September and October are, on the average, 2-3\"'C warmer in Montreal. On Oland the mean annual temperature is 7.5''C, but September and October temperatures are still I-2''C lower than in Montreal (Liljequist 1970, and unpublished data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). November temperature is about the same in the three places. The temperature thresholds for flight in H. brevipalpis and H. orieniatis are similar, and even the periodicity of their flight during the 24-hour period is similar (Fernando and Galbraith 1973) .",

Group 1 consisted of species who did not breed until four to six months after emergence. Group 2 started breeding two weeks after emergence. Two species were intermediate.

H. brevipalpis females are not gravid until after hibernation and therefore have longer time to disperse before reproducing. The species' migration is consequently neatly divided into two parts. Young specimens disperse before hibernation, and the few which survive until the breeding period in the spring (Fig. 3) fly as sexually mature individuals.

At the same time a maxima! reproductive value and colonizing ability imply that migrating females should have eggs just about to mature and preferably have mated in order to utilize short-lived habitats. However, this contradiction is probably only apparent, as the function of migration may not only be to colonize but also to promote outbreeding. This may be more efficiently performed if migrants are immature. I think //. brevipalpis exemplifies a dichotomy in this case, summer fliers promoting outbreeding and spring fliers \"the colonizing function\".

            "text": "When reared in the laboratory at about 2O''C Helophorus spp. usually need about five weeks to develop from egg to adult (Angus 1973) . In their natural environment, in temperatures that are often lower, about two months may be a resonable guess as to the time needed for development. Since the females lay their eggs above or just at the edge of the water, and the larvae are terrestrial (Fernando 1958 , Angus 1973 , superficially resembling carabid larvae) and pupate in the soil, the whole development takes place out of the water. If a female breeds in an ephemeral pond, that may well dry out, the site is still a suitable habitat for the young stages. In, for example, the steppe-like environment of Oiand, large numbers should be capable of developing in ponds which have dried out. The bottoms of such ponds are often moist until late July. I think these large differences in habits and habitat between the young stages and the adult of H. brevipalpis along with its large dispersal power make this species the extremely efficient colonizer of ephemeral waters that it is. Bui this picture is a hypothesis, because the exact habitat of the larva is unknown (Landin 1976a) .",
