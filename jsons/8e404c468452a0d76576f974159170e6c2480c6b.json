In fact, an AI-based model of HealthMap, at Boston Children's Hospital (USA), sounded one of the first alarms on 30 December 2019, around 30 minutes earlier than a scientist at the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (PMED) issued an alert (see the discussion in Naud\u00e9 2020). For the further tracking and prediction of how COVID-19 will spread, however, AI has so far not been very useful. This is for a number of reasons. The first is that AI requires data on COVID-19 to train. An example of how this can be done is the case of the 2015 Zika-virus, whose spread was ex post predicted using a dynamic neural network (Akhtar et al. 2019) . Because COVID-19 is different from Zika, or other infections, and because there are at the time of writing still not sufficient data to build AI models that can track and forecast its spread. Most of the growing number of publications reporting on using AI for diagnostic and predictive purposes so far tend to use small, possibly biased, and mostly Chinese-based samples, and have not been peer-reviewed.",

It is not only a lack of historical training data but also due to problems with using \"big data\", e.g., such as harvested from social media. The pitfalls of big data and AI in the context of infectious diseases was illustrated in the infamous failure of Google Flu Trends. Lazer et al. (2014) referred to these as \"big data hubris and algorithm dynamics\". For instance, as the infection continues to spread, the social media traffic around it accumulates, so the amount of noise accumulates which has to be filtered through before meaningful trends can be discerned. Generally, and this is also bad news for AI forecasting models in other fields, including economics and finance, since for any prediction algorithm that rely on past behavior, a global outlier event with its mass of new and unprecedented data, such as COVID-19, can be described as Rowan (2020) does as \"the kryptonite of modern Artificial intelligence\". As a result, he concludes that over the near future \"many industries are going to be pulling the humans back into the forecasting chair that had been taken from them by the models\".",

Hence, so far, most models used for tracking and forecasting do not use AI methods. Instead, most forecasters prefer established epidemiological models, so-called SIR models Song et al. (2020) . For example, the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin uses an epidemiological SIR model that takes into account containment measures by governments, such as lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing prescriptions. Its model has been applied to China to illustrate that containment can be successful in reducing the spread to slower than exponential rates-see Maier and Brockmann (2020) .",

In fact, this is perhaps where most of the first rush of AI initiatives focused on. Fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 can save lives, limit the spread of the disease, and generate data on which to train AI models. There is growing effort to train AI models to diagnose COVID-19 using chest radiography images. According to a recent review of AI applications against COVID-19 by Bullock et al. (2020) , argues that AI can be as accurate as humans, can save radiologists' time, and perform a diagnosis faster and cheaper than with standard tests for COVID-19. Both X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans can be used. Representative contributions in this regard include Chen et al. (2020b) and Wang and Wong (2020) . The latter developed COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network (see e.g. Rawat and Wang (2017) ), which can diagnose COVID-19 from chest radiography images. It has been trained on open repository data from around 13,000 patients with various lung conditions, including COVID-19. However, as the authors indicate, it is \"by no means a productionready solution\", and they call on the scientific community to develop it further, in particular to \"improve sensitivity\" (Rawat and Wang 2017, p. 6) .",

Indeed, the use of CT scans in European hospitals has dropped after the pandemic broke, perhaps reflecting this concern (Ross and Robbins 2020). It is probably correct as Coldeway (2020) concludes, \"No one this spring is going to be given a coronavirus diagnosis by an AI doctor\". It also seems that comparatively less effort is on using AI for very early diagnostic purposes, for instance, in identifying whether someone is infected before it shows up in X-rays or CT scans, or on finding data-driven diagnostics that have less contamination risk.",

A number of researchers have already reported discovering drugs for repurposing. These include Beck et al.

AI has been argued to be necessary to manage the pandemic by using thermal imaging to scan public spaces for people potentially infected, and by enforcing social distancing and lockdown measures (Rivas 2020) . For example, as described by Chun (2020) \"At airports and train stations across China, infrared cameras are used to scan crowds for high temperatures. They are sometimes used with a facial recognition system, which can pinpoint the individual with a high temperature and whether he or she is wearing a surgical mask.\" It is reported that these cameras can scan 200 persons per minute and will recognize those whose body temperature exceeds 37.3\u00b0 (Dickson 2020) . Thermal imaging has, however, been criticized as being inadequate to identify from a distance a fever in people who are wearing glasses (because scanning the inner tear duct gives the most reliable indication) and because it cannot identify whether a person's temperature is raided because of COVID-19 or some other reason (Carroll 2020) .",

This type usage is not limited to China. A USA computer vision-based startup is already offering \"social distancing detection\" software, which uses camera images to detect when social distancing norms are breached, after which it will send out a warning (Maslan 2020) . At the time of writing, most advanced economies have been considering and/or testing various contact tracing apps and related tools to provide social control, see for instance the discussion in Gershgorn (2020) .",

According to Petropoulos (2020) such apps can \"enable patients to receive real-time waiting-time information from their medical providers, to provide people with advice and updates about their medical condition without them having to visit a hospital in person, and to notify individuals of potential infection hotspots in real-time so those areas can be avoided\".",
