Results showed that (1) various psychiatric complications emerged in the acute treatment phase; (2) certain types of behavioral and verbal responses of healthcare workers (HCWs) were able to ameliorate the psychological distress of the sufferers in the acute phase; (3) the short-term adjustment outcomes of the sufferers were unsatisfactory; (4) 'being an HCW' and 'having a family member killed by SARS' were risk factors predisposing individuals to the development of high distress after discharge; and (5) after controlling for the effects of demographic and risk factors psychosocial factors such as social support, negative appraisal (or perceived impact), positive appraisal (or post-traumatic growth) and self-efficacy could account for substantial variances of differential outcomes including symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life and perceived health of the sufferers. This practitioner report aims to summarize the key findings, which have significant clinical implications in the provision of psychological intervention to the sufferers of SARS or other comparable infectious diseases.

At the acute phase of presentation, common symptoms include fever, influenza-like chills, myalgia, malaise, dizziness, diarrhoea, soreness of the throat, and loss of appetite (Donnelly et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003) . In many cases, rapid and drastic loss of respiratory functioning necessitated the patient being put on a ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU). The case-fatality ratio of SARS is as high as 17% (SARS Expert Committee, 2003) . Given the highly contagious nature of SARS, barrier nursing is compulsory and family support such as bedside visit and company is lost. Furthermore, to combat the cytokine storm and reduce the inflammatory responses in the treatment for SARS, massive doses of steroid are commonly used (Lee et al., 2003) and may cause different psychiatric complications (Sirois, 2003) .",

Over 60% reported the occasional presence of at least mild manic symptoms such as euphoric and labile mood, and pressured speech.

The intercoder reliability for the transcripts and themes was satisfactory (range = 68-85%; mean = 76%, SD = 7.2). The therapeutic phrases and acts are unique verbal or behavioral responses that serve specific functions to ameliorate the distress of the sufferers.

For instance, the case-fatality ratio is approximately 17% (SARS Expert Committee, 2003) . While the physical symptoms are highly debilitating in the acute phase, social support is lost due to strict infection measures and isolation. Distress and poor quality of life (QOL) may persist after the short-term recovery. Second, as carriers of this new, highly contagious, and lethal disease, SARS survivors tend to experience prejudice, alienation and social repulsion. The self-esteem of SARS survivors may be adversely affected. Third, because SARS is so new to us and we have little knowledge about its impacts, worrying questions such as 'Will my family catch the infection from me?', 'Will I have any permanent physical damage?' and 'Will the heavy dosage of steroid have any severe adverse effects on me?' may often emerge among patients during the acute treatment and convalescent phases. Different amounts of negative appraisals may serve to induce and maintain the levels of psychological distress. Finally, steroid related mental disturbances during the acute and convalescent phases could be excruciating (Sheng et al., 2005; Sirois, 2003) , thus possibly worsening the recovery process.",

With a standard cut-off score of 5 in the GHQ-28, over two-thirds of 100 SARS survivors were identified as distressed cases. Under the conservative cut-off score of 6, still 61% of the survivors were classified as distressed cases, whereas only 25% of a community sample (184 subjects with 19% suffering from a physical illness) were positive ones. Besides, as compared with the community sample, these SARS survivors had elevated scores in most of the sub-scales of the Chinese version of the GHQ-28 (GHQ-28, Chan, 1995) and the Hong Kong Chinese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Measure-Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF; Leung, Tay, Cheng, & Lin, 1997) . In another cohort 180 SARS survivors discharged from the hospital for 4 weeks or more participated in a psychological screening (Cheng et al., 2004c) . Interestingly, two-thirds of the participants again reported having a mild level or above of psychological distress as measured by the Chinese versions of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI, Cheng et al., 2002) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Cheng, 2001) . Specifically, 30% of them experienced a mild level of anxiety or depressive symptoms, 25% a moderate level and 10% a severe level. More importantly, only two per cent of these participants reported a history of receiving psychiatric services before (Cheng et al., 2004c) . When compared with the community sample and psychiatric patients with either an anxiety or depressive disorder, these SARS survivors had the mean of the BAI and BDI lying approximately at the mid-point between the two comparison groups. These findings suggest that psychological distress of SARS survivors one month after recovery is real and significant, and that early psychological screening and intervention may be necessary to facilitate the adjustment of SARS survivors after short-term recovery.",

To differentiate high or low levels of distress, the cut-off score 19 (i.e. 'moderate to severe' range) in the BAI or BDI was adopted. Of the 180 responding survivors, 64 patients met the criteria and were categorized into the high distress group. Among various psychoso- (2005) cial variables, 'being an HCW' and 'having a family member killed by SARS' were two risk factors differentiating the high from the low distress groups (OR = 3.8 and 3.4 respectively). Indeed, the finding that 'being an HCW' was a risk factor was replicated in two other studies, where HCWs were found to have more distress, greater depressive and anxiety features, lower self-esteem and worse quality of life than the non-HCW survivors (Cheng et al., 2004a, in review) . One plausible explanation is that HCWs have more negative appraisals of the SARS impacts because they have a higher awareness of the lethality and physical damages caused by SARS (Cheng et al., 2004c) . These negative appraisals at the acute phase might have carry-over effects on distress even after shortterm recovery. In addition, recovered HCWs might encounter prominent worries and anticipatory anxiety in returning to their workplace where they got such traumatic experiences. Thus associated fear, avoidance, and distress related to resuming duties may be particularly salient in the initial stage of recovery. Besides, the low self-esteem of HCWs may be related to the change of self-concept from 'health protector' to 'virus spreader' (Cheng et al., 2004a) .",

Since SARS was a novel disease, the sufferers tended to develop prominent worrying thoughts pertinent to its direct and indirect effects. For instance, they might worry whether their family would catch the infection from them, whether they had any permanent physical damage and whether they would experience social discrimination and repulsion after discharge. To examine these worries, we have developed a scale, the SARS Impact Scale, which is comprised of 12 items that we observed commonly encountered in the local SARS patients during the acute treatment and convalescent phases (Cheng et al., 2004c) . Three mean-ingful factors, that reflected the areas of concern of 'survival threat', 'physical impact' and 'social impact' of SARS, were extracted by factor analysis and accounted for 67% of the total variances. The negative appraisal at both the acute phrase and convalescence explained large portions of the variances for anxiety (37%) and depression symptoms (34%), after the effects of demographic and risk factors were controlled.",

Such positive appraisal or posttraumatic growth can significantly account for some of the variances of differential outcomes. Post-traumatic growth may affect adjustment outcomes via the biological, psychological and social pathways. For instance, individuals who have grown psychologically from trauma may show quicker cortisol habituation to other stressors (Epel, McEwen, & Ichovics, 1998) . Individual who acquires skills or knowledge in a traumatic event may develop a sense of competence in facing future life crisis. Receiving assistance from others in a traumatic situation may also facilitate a greater trust in one's social relationship (Carver, 1998) . Using the Thriving Scale developed by Abra\u00eddo-Lanza and colleagues for individuals with physical illness (Abra\u00eddo-Lanza, Guier, & Col\u00f3n, 1998), we found that three meaningful constructs emerged in the factor analysis for a group of SARS survivors 2 to 6 months after discharge from hospital (Cheng et al., in review) . The first factor, 'Personal growth', included 12 statements such as 'I learned to be a more optimistic person' and 'I learned to be more confident in myself'. The second factor, 'Relationship growth', consisted of five statements such as 'my relationship with my family become more important' and 'I realized how much my family cares about me'. The third factor, 'Spiritual growth', is comprised of two statements, 'my faith in God increased' and 'my confidence in God increased'. Results of regression analyses showed that both the factors 'Personal growth' and 'Relationship growth' significantly explained variances for outcome variables of anxiety, depression and perceived health. of control, the better the adjustment outcomes such as perceived physical and psychological health would be (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) . Together with the perceived impacts of SARS, self-efficacy was found to explain substantial amounts of variances for anxiety, depression, and perceived health (Cheng et al., in review) .",

First, the dose effects of steroid and severity of SARS symptoms account for a portion of the variance of distress. These may reflect the sideeffects of the drug and its residual impacts of the illness on individual patients. Parallel to the previous findings of the significant role of steroid in mood (McAllister-Williams, Ferrier, & Young, 1998) , the findings lend support to the possible influence of steroid on distress of SARS survivors following short-term recovery. Also, social support in both the acute and convalescent phases has been shown to play a vital role in modulating the impacts of SARS. In the acute phase, isolation treatment may put one at a higher risk of developing negative self-perception such as 'I am contagious, bad, and causing harm to others'. Adequate social support in the critical period can have buffering effects against such possible damage to one's self-concept. In convalescence, better social support to survivors may embed pivotal values in emotional and practical terms, and hence can have salutary effects on QOL and distress (Cheng et al., 2004a) .",

For instance, tailor-made psychological screening such as a personal inquiry and invitation for the need of psychological consultation rather than arbitrarily distributing the postal questionnaires would be much appropriate and receptive for counseling. In addition, when facing future possible outbreak, psychological preparation such as stress inoculation (Meichenbaum, 1993) may be needed to strengthen the sense of social support, reduce the associated social discrimination, facilitate the use of socially endorsed communication channels without reducing the amount of contact, brainstorm and share the possible coping, educate and adopt some realistic threat appraisal and boostre the morale among the staff.",

For instance, given the significant role of negative appraisal in the outcomes, cognitive techniques such as comparing with the disadvantaged and reappraising the catastrophic worries might be appropriate when specific maladaptive beliefs are elicited. Further, the clinicians should not only actively inquire about the impacts of SARS, but also elicit and educate various coping efforts that may boostre the coping confidence, and reinforce their perceived ability to cope with the impacts. Also, allowing the survivors to review or reiterate the personal gain and growth from the traumatic experience may create positive meaning, reframe the impacts and possibly alleviate their distress. CONCLUSION SARS has significant adverse psychological impacts on the sufferers during the acute and convalescent phases. An appropriate understanding of its nature and impacts would allow one to formulate relevant psychological intervention strategies for the sufferers. In this paper, we summarize these strategies based on our empirical findings, and hope that the experience might facilitate the best practice of psychological intervention in the field, should there be another outbreak.",
