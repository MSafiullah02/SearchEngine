Because the infection is transmitted through droplets (and possibly aerosols), optimal precautions must be used to prevent the spread of the virus when managing the airway, 2 particularly during intubation and extubation. Herein, we describe a technique to potentially reduce contamination from secretions (droplets) and aerosols during intubation and extubation. It assumes that the operator is wearing the recommended personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of contamination, and that the patient is fully paralyzed.",

The ETT connector is then reconnected (through a 2-cm hole in a clear plastic cover that is placed over the face) to the ETT, which is then connected to the ventilator circuit (with a filter). The ETT clamp is then removed before starting ventilation. In the ICU setting, this can be done in a similar fashion, but just hours before weaning when the patient is not triggering or is still paralyzed. In that case, one must remember to clamp the ETT prior to disconnecting from the ICU ventilator.",

As the patient emerges, the anesthesia mask should be tightly sealing around the mouth (Figure, panel I) and a suction tube placed inside the mask on the side of the tube to aspirate any secretions and the air coming out of the airway while removing the ETT. When the patient is ready to extubate, the ETT is removed (Figure, panel J) while keeping the mask firmly on the face to protect from infection due to coughing. The plastic cover ( Figure, panel K) can then be removed as needed when the patient is breathing and not coughing anymore, after which the circuit can be re-connected to the mask. As the patient further awakens and is ready to be transferred, the lower part of the face mask can be slightly lifted to allow a regular surgical mask to be slid in place prior to leaving the operating room (Figure, panel L) .",
