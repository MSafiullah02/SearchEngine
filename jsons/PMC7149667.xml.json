Organizations, when acquiring or planning biosurveillance systems, take into account the considerable financial resources required to develop, use, and maintain such systems, as well as the feasibility and costs of recruiting and retaining capable personnel. Organizations consider the effects of false alarms, which result in the unnecessary mobilization of multiple resources. False alarms can be expensive and in the extreme case may lead to a boy-who-cried-wolf effect in which users of a system begin to ignore a system either partially or completely. Without a proper understanding of the tradeoffs between action and inaction discussed in the previous two chapters, users of a biosurveillance system may also under-react or delay response to early warning signs of an outbreak, potentially resulting in higher levels of injury, loss of life, and damage to the psychology, operations, and infrastructure of the affected region.",

An economic study is a formal scientific analysis of different choices that individuals, organizations, or societies have to make when resources are scarce. Economic studies can assist an organization in all phases of biosurveillance system operation: from acquisition to setting of alarm thresholds, to decision making in novel situations. In particular, economic studies of such decisions make explicit the choices available in each situation and the potential costs and rewards of each choice. Economic studies can provide guidance to organizations about how much and where to invest in biosurveillance and what level and type of biosurveillance to develop and maintain. They can provide guidance about whether to develop and configure a biosurveillance system that can catch subtle early warning signs but potentially generate many false alarms, or one that only looks for very suspicious warning signs but may miss insidious cases.",

Each type of study has strengths and limitations and differs in feasibility. Retrospective studies are useful, because the past often repeats itself or helps predict the future. However, current and future situations may not mirror the past, and reconstructing past events can be difficult, especially without accurate and comprehensive data. Prospective studies, which involve collecting data while natural or created situations occur, give an analyst much more control over the situations and the information collected. However, prospective studies can be difficult and expensive to perform and only generate results representing specific situations. In the case of outbreaks, prospective studies may be nearly impossible, because the onset and timing of events are unpredictable and creating such an event would be unethical (and quite damaging to one's career). A limitation shared by both retrospective and prospective studies is that the studies are only feasible if the event has occurred or is likely to occur. Predictive studies overcome this limitation because the analyst builds a mathematical model or computer simulation of hypothetical situations. Because most outbreaks are uncommon and many types have never occurred, many biosurveillance-related economic analyses are at least partially predictive. A predictive analysis is always feasible. Moreover, it provides the analyst more flexibility in manipulating the situation that is being modeled to produce insights about a range of potential situations. The key limitation of a predictive study is that it rests on many modeling assumptions.",

For example, in deciding whether to administer a certain vaccine, retrospective study of previous outbreaks and experience with vaccination programs can provide important quantitative data for a predictive economic model. Performing a prospective study, such as vaccinating a small representative sample of the population and tracking the ensuing costs and rewards, can provide additional estimates that facilitate projections about what would happen if a strategy was applied on a larger scale (e.g., the entire population). Retrospective and prospective analyses often provide data for a predictive analysis, such as a computer model of different potential outbreaks and the effects of vaccination programs.",

For example, a study that only measures costs up to one month after a bioterrorist attack may seriously underestimate the impact of that attack because diseases and injuries can have long-term effects. Conversely, if the study attempted to measure the economic impact of that event 300 years into the future, it would clearly run aground on the banks of infeasibility, owing to the many uncertainties whose cumulative effect would be impossible to model. Analysts frequently face a tension between the benefit of increased fidelity from extending the time horizon of an economic study and the difficulty in constructing the model. The ideal balance between the two is often obvious from the specifics of the problem being modeled; nevertheless, it is the rule rather than the exception that economic modelers revise the time horizon as they develop a study.",

Therefore, you must carefully account for every person and organization that may be reasonably involved and affected by an event. For example, a single successful small-scale bioterrorist contamination of a commercial building can lead to many direct costs, including the cost of diagnosing and treating the victims and the cost of decontaminating the building. However, it can also entail indirect costs to the company or companies occupying the building, including lost worker productivity, the cost of finding replacement employees, and damage to the company's reputation and worker morale.

Of course, these charges usually exceed the actual costs; therefore, an economic modeler will convert them to costs by using established cost-to-charge ratios or conversion factors. Moreover, bills may not break down the charges to the level of detail needed. For example, an emergency department visit charge may aggregate many components (e.g., placing an intravenous line, transporting the patient to different locations) of the visit but not identify what fraction of the charge is associated with each component. Finally, charges often do not always accurately reflect the resources consumed or services provided, as some items and services are not billable and some items on a bill may not have been consumed.",

For example, if an anthrax attack resulted in a patient staying 30 days in the hospital, then multiplying the cost of a hospital day by 30 could estimate the per-hospitalized-patient cost of the attack. Of course, the resource-unit use method provides gross estimates, may not account for significant variability (e.g., fluctuation in cost of a day in the hospital), and assumes that the resource unit accurately reflects everything that is being done.",

The earliest economic studies expressed all benefit in purely monetary terms, converting all potential benefits of an intervention into dollars, pounds, yen, francs, etc. However, researchers soon found that they could not easily express all benefits in monetary terms. For example, they could not use monetary terms to capture completely the value of saving a life (e.g., a person contributes to society in many nonmonetary ways, such as providing emotional and psychological support to friends and families), so researchers began using \u201clife-years saved\u201d as a reward for some interventions. However, life-years saved could not adequately represent the benefits of some quality-of-life-improving interventions (e.g., pain medications, walking devices) that do not save lives or the suffering caused by non-life-threatening diseases. As a result, researchers developed quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a health status measure, with one QALY representing a year of perfect health and less than one QALY representing a year of impaired health. Researchers also have developed and used many other reward measures specific to particular classes of interventions, such as the number of bypass operations prevented to measure the success of cardiac medications.",

The practice of discounting recognizes that inflation and opportunity costs (i.e., the value of the next best alternative that you must forego when you make a choice) make a dollar (or any other cost or reward) in the future worth less than a dollar today. An analyst uses discount rates to adjust future costs and rewards to present day values. A discount rate, denoted typically by r, is the rate used to convert future costs or benefits to their present value. For example, if Cn represents a cost n years from now and r is the discount rate, C\n0 (i.e., the current or net present value of Cn) is Cn/(1 + r)n. Although typically researchers use a discount rate between 3% to 5%, there is still considerable debate over the exact appropriate rate (van Hout, 1998; Gravelle and Smith, 2001; Brouwer and van Exel, 2004). By using a 3% discount rate in the above formula, an intervention that earns a $100 ten years from now will be worth $100/(1 + 0.03)10 = $74.41 in today's dollars.",

One implication of these studies for biosurveillance economic analyses is that any cost-of-illness study that fails to include productivity losses may seriously underestimate the potential impact of an outbreak. Outbreaks can be devastating to not only the health care system and directly affected individuals but also many businesses and the economy. This result, if further developed, may perhaps persuade individuals and organizations initially uninterested in biosurveillance to reconsider their stance.

The type and degree of response depend on the severity, nature, and location of the problem. Moreover, there is considerable regional and potentially temporal (e.g., varying by time of day, day of week, and month of year) variation in response mechanisms.

For example, the CUA by Khan et al. (2005) compared different response strategies to a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City. Because SARS can be very difficult to distinguish from other illnesses (e.g., caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophilia) that cause respiratory symptoms and fever, i.e., febrile respiratory illnesses (FRI), the investigators wanted to see the value of home isolation versus testing (for SARS or other common diseases) of patients with FRI. Their analysis included a variety of costs (such as transportation, laboratory tests, influenza vaccination, antimicrobial agents, hospitalization, public health investigation, and patient time) and used the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI) to estimate the changes in health-related quality of life from different situations such as home isolation. The study revealed that using a test (multiplex polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assays) to diagnose other common respiratory infections1\nwould save $79 million and 8,474 quality-adjusted life-years over home isolation.1 Adding SARS testing to the multiplex PCR assays would actually cost $87 million more and decrease utility. The explanation for this less-testing-is-better result is that causes of FRIs other than SARS are much more common than is SARS; therefore, SARS testing would generate false positives, resulting in more patients without SARS erroneously isolated. This study is an excellent example of how additional information provided by testing could actually be suboptimal.",

An example is a CUA conducted by Fowler et al. (2005) that evaluated the incremental cost-utility of four different postanthrax attack strategies (doing nothing, vaccination, administering antibiotics, and administering both antibiotics and vaccinations) and two preanthrax attack strategies (vaccination versus no vaccination). The investigators created a hypothetical cohort of a large metropolitan population with a similar age and sex distribution to New York City and obtained costs, probabilities, and rewards from a variety of sources, including the published literature, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, and the 1998 Statistical Abstract of the United States. The analyses showed that administering vaccine and antibiotics offered more utility (21.36 QALYs) and cost less ($46,099) than did the other three postattack strategies. Of the two preattack strategies, no vaccination was less expensive and resulted in higher QALYs gained per person when the annual risk for attack was 1% and during an attack 10% of the population was infected. However, sensitivity analyses revealed an interesting finding: if the probability of an individual being exposed (i.e., the risk for an attack multiplied by the probability of exposure given an attack) is less than one in 200, then the ICER drops below $50,000 per QALY. In health economics, an ICER of $50,000 per QALY is often used as an arbitrary threshold, as researchers consider anything below this threshold cost-effective. These findings imply that probability of exposure is pivotal in deciding whether to mass vaccinate a population preemptively, another important implication for biosurveillance.",

Such measures may not capture the complex scientific, economic, and social interactions that occur when the ambient environment is threatened and changed. For example, how does surrounding panic or loss of faith in daily business operations affect quality of life? Will existing measures adequately represent psychological distress? What is the cost of losing or damaging the life of a person, such as a healthcare worker, who is essential to mounting an adequate response to the outbreak?

Depending on who becomes ill, an attack can impede or disrupt vital services, such as transportation, health care, law enforcement, and food distribution, further compounding problems. For example, a sudden massive influx of victims into the healthcare system would divert resources and attention from other patients with more \u201ctraditional\u201d but still urgent medical conditions, such as heart disease and stroke. Losing healthcare workers to death or quarantine would decrease an already limited response capacity. Setting up areas to place or quarantine victims would disrupt hospital workflow and reduce overall available space. Existing studies also frequently overlook the psychological consequences of an outbreak, such as fear, hysteria, loss of confidence, and depression, which in sum could be substantial. Studies have shown that stress (Manning et al., 1996; Bejean and Sultan-Taieb, 2005), post-traumatic stress disorder (Frayne et al., 2004), and depression (Greenberg et al., 2003) are extremely costly ailments with insidious long-term consequences.
