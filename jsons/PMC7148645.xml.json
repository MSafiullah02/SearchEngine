ETV can be propagated in lines of equine dermis or embryonic mule skin cells, where it causes a cytopathic effect that results in cell lysis.

Both crypt and villus epithelial cells contain antigen as shown by immunofluorescence. The watery diarrhea is probably a result of loss of resorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa, combined with malabsorption in the small intestine. Infection of crypt epithelium may affect the duration of diarrhea, as regeneration of villus epithelium starts in the crypts. The germinal centers of the Peyer's patches are depleted of lymphocytes and may occasionally show fresh hemorrhage. The dome epithelial cells, including the M cells, display the same cytopathic changes as seen in the absorptive cells of villi. Virions are found in cells of both the small and large intestine. Extracellular virus is closely associated with microvilli of absorptive cells and in the coated pits between microvilli, indicating receptor-mediated endocytosis.
