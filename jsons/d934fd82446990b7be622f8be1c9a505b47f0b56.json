The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of surgical masks (SMs), which are routinely used in ORs, more efficient N95 surgical mask respirator (SMRs) and N100 filtering facepiece respirator (FFRs), against surgical smoke. Methods: Ten subjects were recruited to perform surgical dissections on animal tissue in a simulated OR chamber, using a standard electrocautery device, generating surgical smoke. Six respiratory protective devices (RPDs) were tested: two SMs, two SMRs, and two N100 FFRs [including a newly developed faceseal (FS) prototype]. Fit testing was conducted before the experiment. Each subject was then exposed to the surgical smoke while wearing an RPD under the tests. Concentrations inside (C in ) and outside (C out ) of the RPD were measured by a particle size spectrometer. The simulated workplace protection factor (SWPF) was determined by the ratio of C out and C in for each RPD-wearing subject. Results: For the SMs, the geometric means of SWPF total (based on the total aerosol concentration) were 1.49 and 1.76, indicating minimal protection. The SWPF total values of the SMRs and N100 FFRs were significantly higher than those of the SMs: for the two SMRs, the SWPF total were 208 and 263; for the two N100s, the SWPF total values were 1,089 and 2,199. No significant difference was observed between either the two SMs or the two SMRs. The SWPF total for the novel FS prototype N100 FFR was significantly higher than the conventional N100 FFR. The correlation between SWPF total and fit factor (FF) determined for two N95 SMRs was not significant. Conclusions: SMs do not provide measurable protection against surgical smoke. SMRs offer considerably improved protection versus SMs, while the N100 FFRs showed significant improvement over the SMRs. The FS prototype offered a higher level of protection than the standard N100 FFR, due to a tighter seal. While we acknowledge that conventional N100 FFRs (equipped with exhalation valves) are not practical for human OR use, the results obtained with the FS prototype demonstrate the potential of the new FS technology for implementation on various types of respirators.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Surgical smoke is an aerosol hazard unique to the surgical operating room (OR).

However, due to the variability of surgical smoke and its potential hazards, the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) is also needed to protect healthcare workers in ORs. The Association for periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) recognizes the hazard of the surgical smoke. AORN also urges the use of PPE and evacuation and filtration of smoke through an appropriate system (AORN, 2016a,b,c) . They recommend using fit-tested surgical N95 FFRs or high-filtration masks to protect against surgical smoke (AORN, 2008; Benson et al., 2013) . However these recommendations are not regulatory requirements, and presently the use of N95 FFRs in ORs is primarily limited to procedures involving HPV. Overall, SMs remains the standard protection devices in ORs. Recently, so-called 'N95 surgical mask respirators' (SMRs) have been introduced. The SMRs are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ORs, and certified by NIOSH to receive an N95 grade (although the NIOSH does not evaluate FFRs for surgical use). However, little is known about the performance of either SMs or SMRs against surgical smoke. Rozzi et al. (2012) investigated the absorption capabilities of organic vapor FFRs against the aromatic hydrocarbons generated in surgical smoke, but neither this nor similar investigations addressed the particulate matter component. A higher grade FFR (N100) was pilot-studied against surgical smoke from porcine tissue (Koehler et al., 2014) . One of these facepieces was modified by creating a FS made of ethylene vinyl acetate foam that was affixed to the inner perimeter of the respirator, replacing the stock face seal. The modification significantly improved the respirator performance by minimizing the FS leakage. It is acknowledged that N100 FFRs have limitations for deployment in ORs due to their exhalation valve component. However, it is still important to generate data about the efficiency of these highest grade facepieces against surgical smoke because it will help determine the feasibility of making appropriate design modifications to other respirators, e.g. N95 SMRs (that have no exhalation valves), in order to maximize their performance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 164, "text": "(NIOSH, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 559, "end": 576, "text": "(AORN, 2016a,b,c)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 688, "end": 700, "text": "(AORN, 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 701, "end": 721, "text": "Benson et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1320, "text": "Rozzi et al.

The inlets of the two respective sampling lines were located 6 cm from each other. The same sampling configuration was used in fit testing. The aerosol concentrations and particle size distributions of the inside-and outside-sampled aerosol (C in and C out respectively) were measured by a particle size spectrometer (Nanoparticle Aerosol Monitor/ Mini Wide Range Aerosol Spectrometer, Model 1320, Grimm Technologies, Inc., Ainring, Germany) in combination with an optical particle counter (OPC) (Model 1.108, Grimm Technologies, Inc.). The inside and outside concentration measurements were controlled by a high speed two-way electromagnetic valve. The outside concentration was measured for 6 min following by a 12-min inside measurement; subsequently, the outside concentration was measured again for 6 min.
