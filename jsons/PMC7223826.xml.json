A caliper setting of 0.1 was utilized [22]. Standardized differences (SD) were used to confirm a balanced matching result. The matching result was considered balanced when SD was less than 0.1 (Fig. 1, Table 2) [23]. After a well-balanced matching, outcomes between obese and non-obese patients were compared (Table 3).

Patients undergoing a laparotomy may suffer a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, secondary pneumonia, urinary retention, or a reaction to anesthesia [27, 28]. Among patients requiring surgical intervention, obesity is a significant risk factor for surgical wound infections, increased surgical blood loss, and an increased operative time [8\u201310, 15, 16]. Surgical complications as well as mortality may be increased in obese patients. Therefore, the deleterious role of obesity seems magnified in patients subjected to surgical stress. In obese trauma patients who receive operations, several complications are reported including pneumothorax or hemothorax related to central catheter placement, surgical site infection, surgical wound dehiscence, failure of surgical anastomoses, and increased ventilator days. It is reasonable to assume that more obese individuals have more complications and the cumulative effect of increased complications in operative intervention leads to increased mortality [29].",

Patients outside this range are rare [18]. Possible inaccuracies of procedure codes for abdominal operations also limit our conclusions. The aforementioned limitations notwithstanding the results depict important information about the role of obesity in the surgical outcomes of abdominal trauma patients. Further studies with prospective design and long-term follow-ups are needed. The effect of obesity to outcomes of abdominal trauma patients who received minimal invasive surgery also needs to be evaluated in future studies.",
