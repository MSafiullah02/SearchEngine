            "text": "A great application of drug repurposing is to identify drugs that were\ndeveloped for treating other diseases to treat a new disease. Drug\nrepurposing can be achieved by conducting systematic drug\u2013drug target\ninteraction (DTI) and drug\u2013drug interaction (DDI) analyses. We have\nconducted a survey on DTIs collected by the DrugBank database5 and found that on average each drug has 3 drug targets\nand each drug target has 4.7 drugs.6 The analysis\ndemonstrates that polypharmacology is a common phenomenon. It is important\nto identify potential DTIs for both approved drugs and drug candidates,\nwhich serves as the basis of repurposing drugs and selection of drug targets\nwithout DTIs that may cause side effects. Polypharmacology opens novel\navenues to rationally design the next generation of more effective but less\ntoxic therapeutic agents. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been playing\nessential roles in modern drug discovery and development. To balance the\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy, a hierarchical strategy employing\ndifferent types of scoring functions are applied in both the drug lead\nidentification and optimization phases. A docking scoring function, such as\nthe one employed by the Glide docking program,7 is very\nefficient and thus can be utilized to screen a large library, but it is not\nvery accurate. On the other hand, the molecular mechanical force field\n(MMFF)-based scoring functions are physical and more accurate but much less\nefficient. With the ever increasing computer power, MMFF-based free energy\ncalculation methods, such as the end point MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics\nPoisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area) and MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics\ngeneralized Born surface area) methods2,3,8\u221221\nand the alchemical thermodynamic integration (TI) and free energy\nperturbation (FEP) methods,22,23 have been extensively applied in\nstructure-based drug discovery projects. We have developed a hierarchical\nvirtual screening (HVS) to balance the efficiency and accuracy and improve\nthe success rate of rational drug design.8,24 The newly released\ncrystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease1 provides a\nsolid structural basis for identification of drugs that might interact with\nthis protein target. In this work, I applied multiscale modeling techniques\nto identify drugs that may be repurposed to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\nFlexible docking and MM-PBSA-weighted solvent-accessible surface area (WSAS)\nwere applied as the first and second filters, respectively, to improve the\nefficiency and accuracy of HVS in inhibitor identification for SARS-CoV-2\nmain protease. Compared to the experimental means, CADD-based approaches are\nmore efficient in providing possible treatment solutions for epidemic\ndisease outbreaks like COVID-19. The detailed ligand\u2013residue\ninteraction profile, as well as the decomposition of binding free energy\ninto different components, provides insight into rationally designing potent\nand selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

The cocrystal ligand, N3, was\ncovalently bonded to Cys145. I generated a new version of N3,\nN3\u2032, by breaking the covalent bond and filling in open valence.\nI then evaluated whether Glide flexible docking can reproduce the\nnative binding pose.

Streptomycin, a charged\nmolecule may also be an inhibitor of this SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Our\nstudy suggests that computational drug repurposing screening is very\nefficient and it can provide potential repurposing drug candidates in less\nthan 5 days.
