A multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of hydroxychloroquine involving 150 adults admitted to hospital for COVID-19 reported no significant effect of the drug on accelerating viral clearance.8 An RCT enrolling patients within 12 days of symptom onset found that favipiravir was superior to arbidol in terms of the clinical recovery rate at day 7 in patients with mild illness (62 [56%] of 111 with arbidol vs 70 [71%] of 98 with favipiravir), but not in those with critical illness (0 vs 1 [6%]).9 In severe illness, one uncontrolled study of five patients given convalescent plasma suggested a possible benefit, although the patients already had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies before receipt of the plasma.10 An open-label RCT of oral lopinavir\u2013ritonavir found no significant effect on the primary outcome measure of time to clinical improvement and no evidence of reduction in viral RNA titres compared to control.11 However, per-protocol analyses suggested possible reductions in time to clinical improvement (difference of 1 day), particularly in those treated within 12 days of symptom onset.

The search terms used were (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d or \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d) AND \u201cremdesivir\u201d AND (\u201cclinical trial\u201d or \u201crandomized controlled trial\u201d). We identified no published clinical trials of the effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.\nAdded value of this study\nOur study is the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. The study was terminated before attaining the prespecified sample size. In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups, but was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group, particularly in those treated within 10 days of symptom onset. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, although also not significantly different between groups, was numerically shorter in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nNo statistically significant benefits were observed for remdesivir treatment beyond those of standard of care treatment. Our trial did not attain the predetermined sample size because the outbreak of COVID-19 was brought under control in China. Future studies of remdesivir, including earlier treatment in patients with COVID-19 and higher-dose regimens or in combination with other antivirals or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in those with severe COVID-19 are needed to better understand its potential effectiveness.\n",

Compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir,21 our study population was less ill (eg, at the time of enrolment, 0\u00b74% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64% in the previous study) and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course (median 10 days vs 12 days). Such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir, providing greater effects in our study population, but our results did not meet this expectation. However, our study did not reach its target enrolment because the stringent public health measures used in Wuhan led to marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-March, and restrictions on hospital bed availability resulted in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease. Consequently, we could not adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit. However, among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset, remdesivir was not a significant factor but was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement. Ongoing controlled clinical trials are expected to confirm or refute our findings. In one murine model of SARS, remdesivir treatment starting at 2 days after infection, after virus replication and lung airway epithelial damage had already peaked, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-1 lung titres but did not decrease disease severity or mortality.13 A need for early treatment has been found in non-human primate models of SARS and MERS in which virus replication is very short-lived and lung pathology appears to develop more rapidly than in human infections.17, 19 Such findings argue for testing of remdesivir earlier in COVID-19.",

Studies of higher-dose regimens for which there are safety data (eg, 150\u2013200 mg daily doses) warrant consideration in severe COVID-19. Our study found that remdesivir was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified. The overall proportion of patients with serious adverse events tended to be lower in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients. However, a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, and vomiting), aminotransferase or bilirubin increases, and worsened cardiopulmonary status.",

Of note, in non-human primates, the inhibitory effects of remdesivir on infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovery in bronchoalveolar lavages were much greater than in controls, but viral RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not consistently decreased versus controls.19 Coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir (about six-times increased EC50) have been obtained after serial in vitro passage, but these viruses remain susceptible to higher remdesivir concentrations and show impaired fitness.26 The frequent use of corticosteroids in our patient group might have promoted viral replication, as observed in SARS27 and MERS,28 although these studies only reported prolongation of the detection of viral RNA, not infectious virus. Furthermore, we have no answer to whether longer treatment course and higher dose of remdesivir would be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19.",

However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters. Ongoing studies with larger sample sizes will continue to inform our understanding of the effect of remdesivir on COVID-19. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the antiviral potency of remdesivir (eg, higher-dose regimens, combination with other antivirals, or SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies) and to mitigate immunopathological host responses contributing to COVID-19 severity (eg, inhibitors of IL-6, IL-1, or TNF\u03b1) require rigorous study in patients with severe COVID-19.",
