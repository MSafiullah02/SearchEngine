Many of those medical or surgical conditions may be treated at a later time when the pressure of COVID-19 eases; an example may include a myriad of general surgery problems treated electively [4] . To that end, many specialty societies have published their recommendations regarding postponement of what is considered \"regular\" or \"elective\" care [5, 6] .

Table 1 General recommendations for surgical services All elective surgeries should be postponed until further notice It is possible that with the decrease in the number of elective surgical procedures and the need to increase Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity, surgical staff will be mobilized to provide non-surgical, COVID-19-related patient care. This shift of staff should not have a negative impact in our ability to provide timely care for trauma and emergency surgery patients Cancer operations, patients with highly symptomatic benign disease, significant infections, and those whose delay would precipitate life-threatening outcomes or patient harm should be considered for operative intervention on a case-by-case basis by a multidisciplinary team including surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nursing leadership, depending on local availability of resources Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral nucleic acid is regarded as the reference standard in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; however, delays in swab-to-result time may impact time-critical operative management of surgical conditions The indications and principles of management for trauma and emergency general surgical operations are the same as in non-pandemic circumstances Trauma and Emergency general surgery cases should proceed to the Operating Room in a timely manner with consideration to COVID-19 guidelines for symptomatic patients Patients who do not have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or have no radiologic findings, or have a negative RT-PCR test, should proceed to the OR with standard operating room precautions in place. Anesthesiologists may use N-93/FFP3 masks for intubations, if available Patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection who have a surgical condition requiring immediate attention and have not been tested prior to presentation to the ER, should undergo a chest X-ray and/or a chest Ultrasound and/or a Chest CT to look for bilateral interstitial pneumonitis (peripheral ground-glass consolidations) concerning for COVID-19 infection (Figs. 1, 2) [7-10] Table 2 Emergency surgery for critically ill COVID-19 positive or suspected patients-preoperative planning and case selection Care should be taken to limit delay of interventions and to maintain quality of interventions Cases should be reviewed by two surgeons (attendings/consultants), when available to confirm necessity and to weigh role for alternate interventions If time permits, pre-operative risk stratification tools, such as p-POSSUM, POTTER and NELA, may guide recommendations regarding prognosis and hence appropriate goals of care [11] Should delay to surgery not compromise care, cases should preferentially be performed at times of day when staffing and resources are optimal, and the test result or CT scan is available. This may preserve resources in cases that tested negative or a free of pulmonary infiltrates Patients and families (by phone) should be engaged in robust goals of care conversations. (The recommendations below may not apply to certain countries) Prior to operative intervention, document communication that delineates prognosis, goals of care, recommendations regarding interventions, and code status All admitted patients, and particularly patients proceeding to OR should have consideration to code status and for those with anticipated poor prognosis, \"Do Not Resuscitate\" status should be considered preoperatively to limit the possibility of CPR in the OR The use of vasopressors, in general, are used routinely as standard of care in anesthesia management, in general, and should be permitted following the standard of care Trauma cases should be excluded from discussions regarding goals of care only if immediate surgery is required.

The practice of allowing junior residents and trainees to intubate patients in the COVID-19 OR is highly discouraged as multiple attempts to intubation increase the risk of unnecessary exposure of health care providers in the room Bag Valve Mask (BVM) ventilation prior to intubation should be discouraged. If at all needed, use appropriate filters attached to the mask and secure the mask to the patient's face to avoid leaks and aerosolization Video Laryngoscopy is preferred over Direct Laryngoscopy, when available Fiberoptic intubation should be limited and avoided if possible Disposable equipment should be used where applicable The endotracheal tube cuff should be inflated before initiating mechanical ventilation Closed suction systems should be used for airway aspiration and suctioning Table 7 Surgical approach Surgical approach should be dictated by best-practice accounting for reduced operative times and optimal surgical outcomes The surgical procedure must be performed preferentially by an experienced surgeon. Avoiding using such cases for teaching purposes is highly advisable In certain circumstances, alternatives to conventional surgical procedures may be considered depending on the clinical status of the patient For cases performed laparoscopically, smoke evacuator attached to a HEPA filtration device must be used during the case and at the end of the case to facilitate release of pneumoperitoneum [12] Smoke evacuators/filtration device should be used in all cases requiring electrocautery, laser, or ultrasonic scalpels, to limit exposure to aerosols [13] [14] [15] [16] The Neptune System, where available, may be utilized to permit a closed suction system, if available All efforts should be made to limit the use of electrocautery, laser or ultrasonic scalpel to cases where non-aerosolizing techniques are available and confer acceptable outcomes",
