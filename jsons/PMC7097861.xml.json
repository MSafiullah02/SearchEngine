Grace & Co. obtained patents for a method of extracting neem2 and exercised them to force Indian companies dealing with neem to buy its technology, which led to a worldwide campaign against those patents. Another example involves an extremophile used as an ingredient in detergent and for bleaching jeans. In 2004, the Kenya Wildlife Service planned to launch a lawsuit in US court against Genencor alleging that the company made a large profit from a patent3 based on a microorganism obtained illegally in Kenya4.",

In return, Indonesia will receive technical support and will be able to produce the vaccine under license and export it in the future. This move was due to Indonesia's dissatisfaction with the \u201cunfairness\u201d of having to purchase expensive vaccines created by a developed nation based on samples provided by one's own country, but it was criticized by the WHO, which said that the agreement would \u201cupset the worldwide virus sharing network arrangement.\u201d The incident has made clear that even a pathogenic virus can have the characteristics of a strategic material and can become a bargaining chip between governments.",

This request stipulated that the proceeding should be halted if the country of origin was not disclosed before the grant of the patent and that patents can be invalidated or transferred if incomplete or false information is discovered after patent grant. Furthermore, in 2006, Brazil proposed to the TRIPS Council that presenting evidence of obtaining and complying with PIC and evidence of practicing fair and equitable sharing also be made mandatory as a specification requirement. This proposal is supported by 11 countries including Brazil, India and China.",

With regard to disclosing the country of origin of genetic resources in patent specifications, the JPO and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) have also stated the opinion that imposing new filing requirements would increase the burden on the applicant and could lead to a loss of incentive to file and that such regulations should not be made within the patent law. As a measure against improper patent grants, such as in the case of neem, Japan has suggested that a worldwide database of genetic resources and traditional knowledge should be built and a system created to allow examiners to easily access the prior literature.",

The relevant laws drafted to date include the Indian Biological Diversity Act and updates to the Patent Law. The Indian Biological Diversity Act states that approval of the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) is necessary for foreign companies to access biological resources in India for research or survey purposes, as well as for anyone to provide the results of research obtained on the biological resources in India to foreign companies or researchers. Furthermore, for inventions based on information or research results obtained on the basis of biological resources acquired in India, all applicants need the NBA's approval before filing for any intellectual property rights, within or outside India. In such cases, the NBA can impose benefit sharing and royalty conditions, including requirements for the sharing of monetary benefits arising from the commercial use of the intellectual property rights.",
