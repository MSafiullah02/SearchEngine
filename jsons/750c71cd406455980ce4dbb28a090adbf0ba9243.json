            "text": "Reovirus is an enteric virus comprising eight structural proteins that form a double-layered capsid. During reovirus entry into cells, the outermost capsid layer (composed of proteins 3 and 1C) is proteolytically processed to generate an infectious subviral particle (ISVP) that is subsequently uncoated to produce the transcriptionally active core particle. Kinetic studies suggest that protein 3 is rapidly removed from virus particles and then protein 1C is cleaved. Initial cleavage of 1C has been well described and generates an amino (N)-terminal \u2426 peptide and a carboxyl (C)-terminal peptide. However, cleavage and removal of 3 is an extremely rapid event that has not been well defined. We have treated purified reovirus serotype 1 Lang virions with a variety of endoproteases. Time-course digestions with chymotrypsin, Glu-C, pepsin, and trypsin resulted in the initial generation of two peptides that were resolved in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Most tested proteases cut 3 within a \"hypersensitive\" region between amino acids 217 and 238. In addition, to gain a better understanding of the sequence of subsequent proteolytic events that result in generation of reovirus subviral particles, time-course digestions of purified particles were performed under physiologic salt conditions and released peptide fragments ranging from 500 to 5000 Da were directly analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Trypsin digestion initially released a peptide that corresponded to the C-terminus of 1C, followed by a peptide that corresponded to amino acids 214 -236 of the 3 protein. Other regions of 1C were not observed until protein 3 was completely digested. Similar experiments with Glu-C indicated the hypersensitive region of 3 was cut first when virions were treated at pH values of 4.5 or 7.4, but treatment of virions with pepsin at pH 3.0 released different 3 peptides, suggesting acid-induced conformational changes in this outer capsid protein. These studies also revealed that the N-terminus of 3 is acetylated.",

            "text": "A large number of viruses (e.g., caliciviruses, coronaviruses, many enteric picornaviruses, and reoviruses) are primarily transmitted from host to host by the fecal-oral route. Thus, the predominant route of host infection by such viruses is enteric. During a gastrointestinal infection, such viruses must go through the stomach and endure an acidic pH that can be as low as 0.82 (Vander et al., 1994) . Successful replication of viruses, similar to other obligate intracellular pathogens, requires that the pathogenic organism gain entry into susceptible host cells. Initial steps in such a process involve recognition of the host cell by appropriate viral proteins. After attachment of the virus to a suitable receptor, the virus must be internalized. While some details of how viruses are internalized remain controversial, there is mounting evidence that entry of many viruses is mediated by conformational changes that take place in virus structural proteins. Some of these changes appear to involve exposure of the virus to acidic pH and others appear to involve proteolysis of external virion proteins (White and Fenner, 1994; Young, 2001) .",

Reo-viruses are constructed from eight structural proteins arranged as two concentric capsids; an outer capsid that surrounds an inner capsid \"core\" (reviewed in Nibert and Schiff, 2001) . The outer capsid is composed of up to 36 copies of the cell attachment protein 1 (Larson et al., 1994) , 600 copies of protein 3 (Dryden et al., 1993) , and 600 copies of protein 1, which occurs in the viral capsid both as 1 and its cleavage product 1C (Nibert and Fields, 1992) . The inner core, which is the transcriptionally active structure that produces progeny capped and methylated mRNA from the genomic dsRNA (Yeager et al., 1996) , comprises two major proteins (120 copies of 1 and 150 copies of 2; Reinisch et al., 2000) , and two minor proteins (12 copies of 3 and about 20 copies of 2; Coombs, 1998) . Sixty copies of an additional protein (2) form pentameric spike structures at each of the virion's icosahedral vertices (Ralph et al., 1980; Metcalf et al., 1991; Dryden et al., 1993) that bridge the inner and outer capsid layers.",

Treatment of virions with 10 g/ml \u2423-chymotrypsin at 37\u00b0C for as little as 6 s resulted in the appearance of two smaller polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 27 and 12.5 kDa, as resolved in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, arrowheads) . The sum of these two polypeptide fragment molecular weights is close to the molecular weight of the 41 kDa 3 protein, suggesting the two peptides result from a single cleavage of the protein. Longer digestions lead to the appearance of additional smaller peptides and the eventual generation of a peptide profile similar to that of ISVPs (Fig.   1B , rightmost lane). Treatment of purified virions with low concentrations of other proteases (trypsin, Glu-C, and pepsin) at various pH values for suitable periods of time also led to the generation of two polypeptides ( Fig. 1C -E, ar- Aliquots of gradient-purified T1L virions were diluted to concentrations of 7.3-8.6 \u03eb 10 11 particles/l in appropriate buffers (pH 7.4 for \u2423-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and S. aureus V8 (Glu-C); or pH 4.5 for Glu-C; or pH 3.0 for pepsin), digested with either (A) 200 g/ml \u2423-chymotrypsin, or (B) 10 g/ml \u2423-chymotrypsin, (C) 10 g/ml trypsin, (D) 10 g/ml pepsin, or (E) 10 g/ml Glu-C for the indicated periods of time (minutes for (A-D); hours for (E)) at 37\u00b0C. Reactions were stopped by chilling and addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mM to \u2423-chymotrypsin reactions, by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 125 g/ml to trypsin reactions, by adjustment of pepsin reactions to a pH of 7.5, or by chilling Glu-C reactions. One-quarter volume of 5\u03eb electrophoresis sample buffer was added and peptides from about 1 \u03eb 10 11 particles were resolved in either a 4-16% exponential gradient (A) or a 6 -16% linear gradient (B-E) mini-SDS-PAGE (8 \u03eb 10 \u03eb 0.04 cm) at 150 -180 V for 60 min. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. V: gradient-purified virions; P: 150 ng of indicated protease; C: gradient-purified core particles, separately prepared. Molecular weights, determined from coelectrophoresis of Kaleideoscope Rainbow Marker, are indicated to left of each gel. Virion proteins (, , and 1-3), 1C digestion product \u2426, and potential 3 digestion products (indicated by arrowheads) are indicated to the right of each gel. rowheads), whose aggregate molecular weights added to about 41 kDa. To identify each of the polypeptides generated by each of the proteases and determine precisely where 3 was cut by each of them, we resolved larger aliquots of briefly digested virions in preparative gels, excised the 27and 12.5-kDa bands, and subjected each to in-gel tryptic digestion. Digests then were extracted from the gel matrix as described under materials and methods and examined by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS (i.e., peptide mass mapping) ( Fig. 2B -E). All peaks detected were checked against a database of predicted 3 and trypsin peptide masses to assign peaks to appropriate 3 peptides (Table 1 ) and the amino acid sequences of some peaks were examined by tandem mass spectrometry to corroborate amino acid assignments. For each of the larger 27-kDa polypeptides, we were able to identify a number of 3 peptides, including those corresponding to amino acids [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] , bars above sequence scale line). Each of the smaller 12.5-kDa polypeptides contained several 3 peptides, including those corresponding to amino acids [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [297] [298] [299] [300] [301] [302] [303] [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] [309] [310] [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] , bars below sequence line). In addition, depending upon the initial protease used prior to gel purification, additional tryptic fragments were identified that allowed us to determine the exact cleavage sites used by each protease. For example, the large 27-kDa polypeptide generated by chymotrypsin digestion contained a tryptic fragment with an m/z value of 2918.359, predicted to correspond to amino acids 214 -238 and the small 12.5-kDa polypeptide contained a tryptic fragment with an m/z value of 1069.657, predicted to correspond to amino acids 239 -247. In addition, the large 27-kDa polypeptide contained no tryptic fragments that would correspond to amino acids from residue 239 to the C-terminus and the small 12.5-kDa polypeptide contained no tryptic fragments that would correspond to amino acids from the N-terminus to residue 238. Analyses of these fragments accounted for 220 of the 365 predicted amino acids in 3 (60.3% coverage). We initially did not observe fragments that would correspond to either the N-terminus (residues 1-22) or the Cterminus (348 -365). However, these terminal fragments were detected in direct MALDI-Qq-TOFMS measurements of longer digestions (below), suggesting they were present within the 27-and 12.5-kDa polypeptides but not effectively eluted from the gel matrix. Taken together, these observations indicate that the initial cut made in 3 by \u2423-chymotrypsin occurs between Tyr 238 and Arg 239 (Fig.  2G , H), also as very recently determined (Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002) . The identities of many of these tryptic fragments were corroborated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) (see below). Similar analyses of the large and small peptides generated by other proteases indicated that trypsin cut predominantly between Arg 236 and Ala 237 , although, in a small proportion of 3 molecules, the initial trypsin cut was between Arg 259 and Ala 260 (which is consistent with the appearance of a doublet in the gel ( Fig. 2A) ), and Glu-C cut predominantly between Glu 217 and Trp 218 , irrespective of whether the reaction was performed at pH values of 7.4 or pH 4.5, which is consistent with the slightly faster migration of the Glu-C-generated large peptides ( Fig. 2A ). There were some differences in the distribution of tryptic peptides identified after Glu-C digestion under different pH conditions, suggesting some minor acid-induced conformational changes in 3. No peaks corresponding to amino acids C-terminal of residue 214 were found in the 27-kDa polypeptide generated by Glu-C digestion at pH 7.4 (Table  1) . However, small peaks corresponding to tryptic fragments 214 -236 (m/z 2647.335) and 209 -236 (m/z 3290.522) were observed in spectra generated from 27-kDa polypeptides purified after Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 ( Table  1 ), suggesting that, in some particles treated at this acidic pH, Glu-C cut between Glu 241 and Leu 242 . Analyses of tryptic fragments in the large and small pepsin-generated peptides indicated that this protease initially cut 3 at one of two possible sites, and with apparently nearly equal efficiency. Thus, some 3 molecules were initially cut between Ala 237 and Tyr 238 , whereas other 3 molecules were cut between Thr 244 and Pro 245 .",

            "text": "Major advantages of the MALDI-Qq-TOFMS include the capacity to rapidly analyze complex mixtures of peptides in physiologic salt solutions without the need for additional purification methodologies which might lead to sample loss. In addition, whereas gel analyses required visualization of nanogram quantities of peptide, the approximately 100-fold greater sensitivity of the MALDI-Qq-TOFMS instrument might reveal early rare events undetectable by SDS-PAGE strategies. Thus, to perform more complete analyses of the cascade of proteolytic events that take place in multiple viral capsid proteins during digestion with various proteases at different pH values, we treated purified reovirus particles with proteases used above and analyzed released peptide fragments directly by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS at a variety of time intervals. We initially chose trypsin to study early proteolysis of surface-exposed epitopes at neutral pH because of the relatively large number of arginine and lysine residues in most reovirus capsid proteins. For these studies it also was important to maintain viral structural integrity. Preliminary MS experiments tested various buffer solutions. Reovirus virion particles were unstable in ammonium bicarbonate solution (normally suitable for MALDI analysis; data not shown), but virion structure was retained in Tris-HCl buffer with physiologic concentrations of salts (normally too high for MS analyses). To simplify MS analyses, controlled experiments examined the amount of signal noise normally caused by salts in the mass spectra of virus digests by comparing spectra generated from virus alone, protease alone, and virus plus protease in buffers of various ionic strength. In addition, true peptide fragments appeared with increasing intensities during Electrophoretic separation of 2.5 \u03eb 10 11 virions digested with 10 g/ml of indicated proteases for 30 s (\u2423-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and pepsin) or for 1.5 h (Glu-C) and resolved in a 6 -16% linear gradient SDS-PAGE (16 \u03eb 16 \u03eb 0.1 cm) at 6.0 W for 5 h. Molecular weights, determined from coelectrophoresis of Kaleidoscope Rainbow Marker, are indicated to left of gel. Virion proteins, enzymes (\u03f3250 ng), and inhibitors (P: pepsin; G: Glu-C; T: trypsin/chymotrypsin; S: soybean trypsin inhibitor), and potential 3 digestion products (indicated by arrowheads and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry) are indicated to right of gel. (B-E) MALDI-Qq-TOF mass spectra obtained from tryptic in-gel digestions of (B) \u2423-chymotrypsin-generated large fragment (indicated by large arrow head in A), (C) \u2423-chymotrypsin-generated small fragment (indicated by small arrow head in A), (D) trypsin-generated large fragment, and (E) trypsin-generated small fragment. Values above peaks indicate measured m/z values of peaks identified as corresponding to virion protein 3 (shown in Table 1 ).

(H) Diagrammatic representation of entire 3 protein with initial cleavage sites of tested proteases indicated. longer digestion times, and individual peaks were subsequently identified by MS/MS measurements. Initial analyses of a complete tryptic digest of reovirus serotype 1 Lang (T1L) virions allowed subsequent identification of the major outer capsid proteins 3 and 1, and the core proteins 1, 2, and 2 (data not shown). Identities of all peaks resolved in this initial tryptic digest spectrum were corroborated by tandem MS and used as reference for amino acid assignments in this study.",

NCBI and SwissPro database searches of peak masses and subsequent MS/MS analyses of selected peaks against all available viral and nonviral proteins led to the identification of indicated 3 and 1 peptides. Results are summarized in Table 2 . Examination of peptide fragments released during shorter digestion periods predicted that the first peptide released from 3, at 90 s, with an m/z value of 2684.226, corresponded to residues Ser 214 -Arg 236 (predicted m/z value of 2684.230) ( Table 2A) . The low-energy MS/MS spectrum of this ion revealed a set of b and y ions shown in Fig. 4A . The b and Table 1 Tryptic peptides identified in 27-and 12.5-kDa fragments after brief digestion of 3 with indicated proteases y ion \"ladder\" corresponds to the predicted sequence of the Ser 214 -Arg 236 fragment. With increased digestion times, additional peptides that corresponded to regions immediately N-terminal of, and C-terminal of the Ser 214 -Arg 236 peptide, were identified ( Fig. 5A and Table 2A ) and confirmed by MS/MS (data not shown). Peptides corresponding to virtually the entire 3 protein sequence were identified within 10 min of digestion ( Fig. 5A and Table 2A) , further attesting to the rapid removal of this protein from virions during proteolytic digestion. A peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of protein 3 was not initially identified by a direct database search with MS-Tag, but a major unidentified peak at m/z 2511.2 was observed. The predicted N-terminal tryptic peptide of 3 consisting of amino acid residues 1-22 has a calculated m/z value of 2469.202 that was absent in the mass spectrum (Fig. 3) . This could indicate that the N-terminal portion of 3 remains attached to particles or that this peptide may be modified in such a way that its mass is different from that predicted. The low-energy MS/MS spectrum of the ion at 2511.21 revealed a set of b and y ions shown in Table 3A , corresponding to the N-terminal peptide 1-22 of 3. The masses of all b\u0408 n fragment ions and the parent ion (y\u040822) are 42.010 Da more than the calculated values, indicating the N-terminal methionine residue of 3 was modified by acetylation.",

Entry of reovirus is thought to involve conformational changes associated with acidic treatment prior to proteolysis. Therefore, we also examined proteolysis of purified virions at low pH. Samples of purified T1L virions were adjusted to pH 3.0 or 4.5 and then digested with pepsin or Glu-C, respectively, at 37\u00b0C. Equivalent aliquots were removed at various time points ranging from 30 s to 24 h. Digestions were inhibited with the immediate addition of 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 to pepsin-digested samples (confirmed to raise the pH sufficiently to irreversibly inhibit the enzyme), or by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to Glu-C-digested samples. Digestion products were analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. All Glu-C peptides were identified by peptide mapping and high-accuracy mass measurements to allow direct comparison to corresponding peaks previously identified by peptide mapping and MS/MS measurements of the pH7.4 Glu-Ctreated samples (above), whereas all identified pepsin fragments were sequenced with MS/MS analysis because of pepsin's nonspecific cleavage. For example, the low-energy MS/MS spectrum of the second ion detected after pepsin digestion (at m/z 1419.741) revealed a set of b and y ions shown in Table 3B , corresponding to amino acids 195-206. Results of both acidic digestions are summarized in Table  2C . The first peak identified after digestion of intact virions with Glu-C at pH 4.5 corresponds to 3 amino acids Gly 199 -Asp 217 , the same peptide initially released by this protease at pH 7.4. However, the first peptide identified after pepsin digestion of virions at pH 3.0 corresponded to amino acids Asn 111 -Leu 128 in 3. This pepsin-digested fragment is about Fig. 3 . Peptide mapping of tryptic T1L virion digests. 5 mg/ml purified T1L virions were digested with 5 g/ml trypsin at 37\u00b0C. At various time intervals, aliquots were collected and analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Each peak was then selected and subjected to MS/MS analysis (see Fig. 4 ) to identify each peptide fragment (compiled in Table 2A ). Each peak is labeled in the time frame at which it is first detected. 100 residues closer to the N-terminus than where trypsin and Glu-C originally cleaved at pH values of 4.5 and 7.4, suggesting a conformational change in 3 had taken place as a result of the more acidic treatment (Table 2 and Fig. 5 ).",

Compared to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the tolerance to impurities permits the sample to be analyzed without any further sep-aration or purification by methods similar to liquid chromatography. This alleviates sample losses associated with additional separation, which was particularly important for observation of the first peptides released during time-course digestion studies, which appeared after a few seconds at relatively low concentration compared to the salts. The technique is also fast, even with a low repetition-rate laser, allowing a large number of samples to be acquired in timecourse studies. This is essential to distinguish changes in the spectrum to discriminate against noise. The high mass accuracy (average mass errors are 0.01 Da or less (Tables 1-3)) in both single MS and MS/MS mode gives high success rate in protein identification by database searches. The high accuracy in MS/MS measurements is also particularly useful for de novo peptide sequencing or for identification of posttranslational modifications.",

            "text": "Previous work has indicated that virtually all reovirus proteins are blocked at their N-termini (Pett et al., 1973) . Outer capsid protein 1 contains a myristoyl group at its N-terminus (Nibert et al., 1991) . Very recent reports also have identified an acetyl group at the N-terminus of 3 (Jane- Valbuena et al., 2002) , as confirmed in this study (Table 3A) , and at the amino-terminus of minor reovirus core protein 2 (Swanson et al., 2002) . The function of an acetyl group at the N-terminus of 3 is unknown, but, based on roles of other acetylated molecules, may serve to provide structural stability (Cumberlidge and Isono, 1979; Nguyen et al., 2000) and/or promote protein complex assembly (Berger et al., 1981; Tercero and Wickner, 1992) . Another possibility is that the acetylation of its N-terminus may be required to differentiate the role(s) 3 plays during the virus life cycle. Protein 3 binds dsRNA (Huismans and Joklik, 1976) , which may occur only when the protein dimerizes (Olland et al., 2001) , 3 is thought to counteract the reovirus induced host antiviral defence mechanism (Yue and Shatkin, 1997) , and 3 may play a role in the assortment complex during particle assembly (Antczak and Joklik, 1992) . Previous studies also have shown that the efficiency of cellular translation is determined by the cytoplasmic level of 3 that is not complexed with 1 (Schmechel et al., 1997) . Thus, some level of regulation must dictate which of the numerous roles 3 functions in. One possible means of control is through 1 binding, which would effectively (Olland et al., 2001) . A third possibility, currently under investigation, is that acetylation of 3 may influence its regulatory roles, as suggested for a number of other acetylated proteins (reviewed in Polevoda and Sherman, 2000) .",

A large number of dramatic conformational changes, thought to be important in different stages of reovirus disassembly, have been described. These include changes during cell attachment (Fernandes et al., 1994 ), uncoating (Dryden et al., 1993 , and transcription (Yeager et al., 1996) . However, the entire virion has, to date, resisted crystallization and environmentally induced conformational alterations in the complex, that may result from exposure to acidic pH and pepsin (such as when this enteric virus passes through the stomach where the pH can be as low as 0.8; Vander et al., 1994) , are poorly understood. The present analyses of purified virions by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry has furthered this understanding and has provided evidence about the nature of viral outer capsid proteins in terms of structure, orientation, and conformational alterations.",

When virions were digested with \u2423-chymotrypsin, pepsin, trypsin, and Glu-C protease, 3 digestion initiated within a protease hypersensitive region (Fig. 2) , which indicates this region is located on the external surface of the virion. Other studies that examine 3 digestion have recently determined that this hypersensitive region is also initially cut by other proteases, including alkaline proteases such as trypsin (Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002) and acidic proteases, such as cathepsins (Ebert et al., 2002; Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002) . Our strategy of directly measuring peptides released from protease-treated intact particles by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS also allowed us to determine subsequent proteolytic events during the cascade of 3 and 1 digestion. These time-course studies showed that protein 3 digestion proceeded bidirectionally toward both the N-terminus and the C-terminus, except that tryptic peptide fragment Ser 144 -Lys 162 did not appear until after the remainder of the protein had been completely digested, which suggests this peptide may have been particle bound, and/or it may be this region of 3 that interacts with underlying 1, as suggested in the 1/3 heterohexamer structure (Liemann et al., 2002) . This result was not observed when virions were digested with Glu-C protease, which may be attributable to the fact that there are far fewer Glu-C cleavage sites that could result in the lack of detection of such a fragment.",

The appearance of this 1 fragment suggests that the C-terminus of 1 is accessible to trypsin and hence may be exposed on the surface of the virion, consistent with a recent hypothesis that this unresolved portion of 1 in the 1/3 crystal structure constitutes an exposed blob within the virus (Liemann et al., 2002) . Furthermore, immunologic assays, using monoclonal antibodies directed against 1, react with intact virions, which suggest a portion of 1 is exposed on the virion surface Virgin et al., 1994) , as also suggested by other structural studies (Dryden et al., 1993; Liemann et al., 2002) .

            "text": "The present MALDI-Qq-TOFMS analyses of purified reovirus virions identified different initially released peptides when T1L was digested with different proteases under different pH conditions. This may provide evidence that T1L 3 molecules undergo a conformational change when exposed to acidic pH. However, we acknowledge difficulty in interpreting data from using two different enzymes with different amino acid cleavage specificities under these significantly different pH condi-tions. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any single enzyme that operates efficiently under both pH conditions. Thus, it also is possible the different initially released peptides result from different enzyme specificities. To attempt to alleviate the difficulty in interpretation of experiments carried out with different enzymes under different pH conditions, we also performed experiments with Glu-C, which, unlike trypsin and pepsin, can operate under widely different pH conditions (pH 7.4 and 4.5). Tryptic digests of 3 proteins that had been cut only once with Glu-C ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 , columns 4 and 5) revealed minor differences, while kinetic studies of the cascade of proteolytic events in whole particles (Fig. 5 , and compare Table 2B to 2C) revealed no differences. Part of the difficulty with using Glu-C for such comparative studies is the lower frequency of appropriate cleavage sites in 3 and their uneven distribution, which results in some sequence-predicted peptides that would lie outside the normal operating m/z range (500 -5000) of the MALDI-Qq-TOFMS used. Other apparent paradoxes are that the initial Glu-C cleavage site (Glu 217 ) and initial fragment released by Glu-C digestion (Gly 199 -Glu 217 ) appear, predicted from fitting the 3/1 heterohexamer crystal structure into whole particle cryo-EM reconstructions (Liemann et al., 2002) , to reside in regions of the 3 protein that abut other 3 proteins located in adjacent 3/1 heterohexamers. Resolution of this apparent conflict, which may result from the different methodologies of comparing static crystal structures to virions digested in solution, the latter of which may be capable of \"breathing,\" as well as additional studies to better examine possible pH-induced conformational alterations, are underway. Interestingly, despite these differences, 3 is completely cleaved rapidly under each of these conditions to generate a subviral particle, which suggests the virus has evolved to successfully uncoat itself under a variety of conditions likely to be encountered during infection.",

Aliquots of virus were digested with proteases within 14 days of having been dialyzed. Purified virions were usually diluted to final concentrations of 3-5 mg/ml into buffers precalibrated to produce final pH values of 3.0, 4.5, or 7.4, and then the diluted virions were incubated at 37\u00b0C with various concentrations of Glu-C, chymotrypsin, trypsin, or pepsin at a final proteinto-enzyme ratio of 10:1 to 1000:1. Under conditions of high viral particle concentration, extended proteolysis of virions was confirmed to generate core particles (data not shown). Aliquots from the digestion reactions were collected at various time intervals. For peptides subsequently resolved in polyacrylamide gels, further digestion of viral proteins was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to chymotrypsin digestions to a final concentration of 5 mM, by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 125 g/ml to trypsin digestions, by addition of 1/25th volume of 1 M Tris pH 8.8 to pepsin reactions, and by chilling Glu-C reactions.

Samples were irradiated with a nitrogen laser (Laser Science Inc., model 337ND) operating at a repetition rate of 7 Hz for single MS and 15 Hz for tandem MS. Single MS spectra were acquired in approximately 1 min; tandem mass spectra were accumulated for several minutes. For tandem mass spectrometry, selected ions were fragmented in a collision cell that contained argon. The collision energy was adjusted manually between 30 and 170 eV to obtain optimum fragmentation of the parent ions.",

The ion was dissociated using argon as the collision gas. The collision energy was set to 140 eV and then slightly adjusted to obtain optimum fragmentation of the parent ion. Spectra data acquisition was performed using software developed in-house (Tofma, University of Manitoba, MB). Sequence analysis indicates the ion corresponds to 3 peptide 214 -236.
