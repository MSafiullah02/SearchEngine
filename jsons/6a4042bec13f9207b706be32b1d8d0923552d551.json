            "text": "A full-length genome sequence of 27 739 nt was determined for the only known European turkey coronavirus (TCoV) isolate. In general, the order, number and size of ORFs were consistent with other gammacoronaviruses. Three points of recombination were predicted, one towards the end of 1a, a second in 1b just upstream of S and a third in 3b. Phylogenetic analysis of the four regions defined by these three points supported the previous notion that European and American viruses do indeed have different evolutionary pathways. Very close relationships were revealed between the European TCoV and the European guinea fowl coronavirus in all regions except one, and both were shown to be closely related to the European infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Italy 2005. None of these regions of sequence grouped European and American TCoVs. The region of sequence containing the S gene was unique in grouping all turkey and guinea fowl coronaviruses together, separating them from IBVs. Interestingly the French guinea fowl virus was more closely related to the North American viruses. These data demonstrate that European turkey and guinea fowl coronaviruses share a common genetic backbone (most likely an ancestor of IBV Italy 2005) and suggest that this recombined in two separate events with different, yet related, unknown avian coronaviruses, acquiring their S-3a genes. The data also showed that the North American viruses do not share a common backbone with European turkey and guinea fowl viruses; however, they do share similar S-3a genes with guinea fowl virus.",

They have a capped and polyadenylated positive-sense genome that serves as a template for the synthesis of either a full-length antigenome or a nested set of shorter negative-stranded RNA copies. These, in turn, generate new full-length positive-sense genomic molecules or a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs for expression of the viral proteins (Lai et al., 2007) , respectively.",

            "text": "Currently, four genera of coronaviruses have been defined, alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The genus Gammacoronavirus is mostly composed of viruses isolated from birds: Galliformes (chicken, turkey, quail, guinea fowl, pheasant, peafowl) , Anseriformes (duck, goose teal, swan, pintail), Columbiformes (pigeon), Pelecaniformes (spoonbill, heron), Suliformes (cormorant), Charadriiformes (red knot, oystercatcher, black-headed gull) and Passeriformes (bulbul); however, recently, gammacoronaviruses have also been identified in the beluga whale and bottlenose dolphins (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2014) . The most economically important of the avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) are infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronaviruses (TCoVs). IBVs, which were the first coronaviruses to be isolated back in the 1930s, cause highly contagious infectious bronchitis in domestic fowl, a respiratory, renal and genital disease with serious economic consequences worldwide (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008) . TCoVs, initially linked in the 1970s with an enteric disease known as transmissible enteritis, coronaviral enteritis of turkeys or bluecomb (Guy, 2008) , have more recently been associated with a syndrome that includes several intestinal disorders occurring in turkeys before 7 weeks of age and usually within the first 3 weeks of life (Barnes et al., 2000) , known as poult enteritis complex (PEC). The emergence of coronaviruses in turkeys in the USA was proposed to have resulted from recombination events involving IBVs and an as-yetunidentified coronavirus donating a spike (S) gene that encoded a protein of low amino acid identity to those of IBV (35 %). This is suspected to have resulted in a host shift from chickens to turkeys and also in an altered tissue tropism of the virus from upper respiratory to intestinal. Recombination has been proposed in preference to evolution or selection of a subpopulation of viruses owing to this low S protein amino acid identity and because under experimental conditions exposure/passage of TCoVs in chickens did not result in selection for genetic changes that were sufficient to maintain infection and replication in chickens (Jackwood et al., 2010) . It has also been shown, using patterns of synonymous substitutions to determine the index of mutation rates in protein-coding genes, that mutation rates in the S genes of IBV and TCoVs are very similar to those in their other genes (Hughes, 2011) .",

These conclusions were drawn according to the nucleotide and putative amino composition of its full-length S ORF; 98 % identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels was observed between the detected genomes of three French strains, whereas these figures were at most 65 and 60 % with US TCoVs, and at most 50 and 37 % with IBVs. Even lower aa identities were seen in the S1 subdomain between the Fr TCoVs and the US TCoVs (42 %), and between Fr TCoVs and IBV (18 %). Further analysis using partial nucleotide sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORFs suggested that similar recombination events played a role in the evolution of the US and Fr TCoVs (Maurel et al., 2011) , yet involving IBVs originating from their respective continents.",

Fr TCoV was not closely related with any of the American TCoVs. In the second tree (Fig. 2b) , generated using nt 8659 to 20 280 (region between the first and second predicted recombinant sites), Fr TCoV was again coupled with GfCoV/Fr/2011 and again placed in close proximity to Italy 2005, although the bv (69 %) was below the threshold limit, set at 75 %. US TCoVs were grouped with IBVs of US origin (bv 85 %), with the exception of IBV Delaware 072. A unique trend was observed in the third tree (Fig. 2c) , nt 20 281 to 24 058 (region between the second and third predicted recombinant sites, mostly corresponding to the S gene), where Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoVs were grouped together (bv 100 %) and separated from all IBVs. These three types of viruses then formed three branches, each supported by a bv of 100 %. In the fourth tree (Fig. 2d) To further illustrate the predicted recombination sites, a Bootscan analysis (Fig. 3) was performed using viruses that were closely related to Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 in the previously described phylogenetic trees. This analysis exposed traces that also grouped them with the European IBV Italy 2005 in the majority of the sequence leading up to the second predicted breakpoint at 20 280 (just upstream of the sequence encoding the S gene), and from the third predicted breakpoint, 24 058 (ORF 3a), to the end of the genome. A small zone of sequence (8747-9971) positioned around the first predicted breakpoint at 8658 (ORF 1a) grouped both Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 with US TCoV TX-GL.

This TCoV/GfCoV/Fr/2011 cluster was further separated into Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoVs. A calculation of nucleotide identities for this region between the three groups revealed a much closer relationship between GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US CoVs (80-81 %) than between GfCoV/Fr/2011 and Fr TCoV (64 %) or Fr TCoV and the US TCoVs (64-65 %). The Bootscan results mostly corroborated these relationships; however, they further identified a small zone of sequence (8747-9971) that grouped both Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 with an American TCoV, TCoV (TX-GL). This zone of sequence was not identified when using the 69 full-length sequences for prediction of recombination events; however, it did fall close to breakpoint 8658. As the two zones of sequence either side of this position grouped the same viruses, the first potential recombination breakpoint in terms of evolutionary hypothesis was considered to be position 20 281.",

On the other hand, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and Fr TCoV have a very similar genetic background in other genes, and therefore the recombination event that generated these viruses by conferring on them their specific S gene must have involved either the same or very similar recipient IBVs.

A second recombination event (Fig. 5b , R2) involving a US IBV recipient and GfCoV/Fr/2011 would have generated US TCoV viruses, which share a stronger S gene similarity with GfCoV/Fr/2011 than with Fr TCoV. To help evaluate which of the two hypotheses was the more plausible, attempts were made based on the sequence data presented here to define the TMRCA for the different regions of the studied genomes. A theoretical result showing a TMRCA for the S gene of Fr TCoV and GfCoV that was greater than the TMRCA of their proposed shared IBV backbones would mean that the hypothesis shown in Fig. 5 (a) was more likely; however, a result showing a TMRCA for the S gene and the backbone that were the same would be in favour of Fig. 5(b) .

The domestication and complex worldwide diffusion of domestic guinea fowl, turkey and chickens may have provided ample opportunities over centuries for such inter-specific contacts. Chicken and guinea fowl breeding was already documented in ancient Greece, and guinea fowl meat featured in Roman banquets in the first century AD (Scherf, 2000) . Although guinea fowl breeding was subsequently abandoned in Europe, this species was reintroduced when the Portuguese returned from Africa in the late 15th century (Belshaw, 1985) . Both chicken and guinea fowl were transferred to the New World shortly after its Discovery: animal breeding farms established by 1495 in Cuba and Santo Domingo included chickens, which supposedly were shipped soon after to Mexico and South America (Scherf, 2000) . The first shipments of guinea fowl to the Caribbean are documented slightly later, in 1508 (Lamblard, 1975) . Such introductions of European poultry could have brought chicken and guinea fowl into contact with domestic turkeys, which apparently underwent a complex domestication history (Speller et al., 2010; Kennedy Thornton et al., 2012) and were reportedly widespread in Mesoamerica at the time of the Discovery and in the Caribbean soon after (Crawford, 1985) . Reciprocally, the first shipment of domestic turkeys to Europe was documented in 1500 and turkey breeding, first encouraged in Spain in 1511, quickly expanded from southern to northern European countries in the first half of the 16th century (Crawford, 1985) . Clearly, these movements must have led to the repeated introduction of naive birds into new ecosystems in both the New and Old Worlds, such epidemiological situations being favourable for inter-species transmission events. Similar situations most likely reoccurred over the centuries, as poultry (turkey) breeds developed in Europe were further re-exported to the Americas.",

First, cDNA molecules corresponding to the regions of missing sequence were prepared using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Next, dsDNA PCR products were amplified from each cDNA using Expand High Fidelity enzyme (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally PCR products were purified using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey Nagel) and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit as recommended by the manufacturer, in a 3130 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Each PCR product was amplified twice and sequenced in both directions. The genome 39 extremity was determined using classic 39 RACE as previously described (Sambrook & Russell, 2001) . Several attempts to determine the 59 extremity using 59 RACE failed; therefore, a consensus sequence derived from the 59 extremities of 68 other AvCoVs was added.",

LN610099) (Ducatez et al., 2015) , which was kindly provided by Dr M. Ducatez (INRA, Toulouse, France). The French TCoV sequence was aligned with these 69 sequences with CLUSTAL W. Alignment was adjusted and manually checked in accordance with the correct reading frame of the different genes. To optimize the phylogenetic analyses, the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was evaluated using 'Find Best DNA/Protein Models (ML)' in MEGA v6 (Tamura et al., 2013) according to the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion (Posada & Crandall, 2001) . Then, phylogenetic analysis was performed by the maximum-likelihood method (Felsenstein, 1981) and the general time-reversible (GTR)+G+I substitution model.

Recombination events were considered reliable when detected with the highest multiple-comparison corrected P-value cut-off set at 10 25 in at least four different methods. In order to expose the recombination events implicating Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 by Bootscan analysis, three US TCoVs (MG10, TX-GL 01 and VA-74 03), three IBVs closely related to Fr TCoV (Italy 2005, NGA A116E7 and SWE 065894) and three more distant IBV relatives (Beaudette, KM 91 and 4/91) were used. The analysis was performed on the basis of pairwise distance, modelled with a window size of 1000 nt, step size of 100 nt, and 100 bootstrap replicates as parameters (Fig. 3) .",

The TMRCA of avian gammacoronaviruses was estimated based on four different genome regions (part of 1a, part of 1b, the full-length S gene and part of the region after S). For each partial genome region, all dated sequences that were neither of clone nor of vaccine origin and did not expose any evidence of recombination were selected (typically 40 sequences per region). For the S gene, all available full-length sequences of TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 that were dated were used, corresponding to seven American TCoV, four French TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011. With BEAUti software, the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock with the GTR+G + I model of nucleotide substitution was applied with constant size demographic models. The trace files were visualized with Tracer 1.6, especially to verify that the effective sample size value was greater than 200, which corresponds to the minimum acceptable number of independent samples. Maximum clade credibility trees were generated after removing a 10 % burn-in with TreeAnnotator v1.7.5. The trees obtained were also visualized and annotated by FigTree v1.4 software. For each part of the genome studied, the age of the most recent common ancestor between Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 was determined with a posterior probability above or equal to 0.90, and then dates for the different genome regions were compared. Uncertainty in the estimated results was reported as values of the 95 % HPD.",

Independently from these events, the same European recipient IBV (or GfCoV/Fr/ 2011 itself) was involved in another recombination event with AvCoV donor 1, which supplied the Fr TCoV-like S gene, thus resulting in Fr TCoV[Fig. 5a (iii) upper  panel]. A recombination event is proposed here rather than the evolution of GfCoV/Fr/2011 into Fr TCoV owing to the substantial number of nucleotide modifications required for GfCoV/Fr/2011 S to become Fr TCoV S. Also, as mutation rates in the S genes of IBV and TCoVs are very similar to those in their other genes(Hughes, 2011), then it would be expected that this number of changes would have imposed an accumulation of nucleotide modifications in the other areas of sequence, so that GfCoV and Fr CoV would not have been so closely related in the trees derived from other genes. Because of the similarities of the S genes of Fr TCoV, US TCoV andGfCoV/Fr/2011, it can be inferred that 'AvCoV donor 29 and 'AvCoV donor 1' should in this model share a common ancestor ['AvCoV donor ancestor' in Fig. 5a (i) upper panel]. Of course, all IBV strains participating in these recombination events do share a common ancestor ['IBV ancestor' in Fig. 5a (i) lower panel].",

In (a) the yellow line corresponds to FN430414_ITA_90254_2005 -Turkey_GQ427174_TCoV_TX-GL_01; blue, FN430414_ITA_90254_2005 -Fr-TCoV-080385d_; purple, Turkey_GQ427174_TCoV_TX -GL_01 -Fr-TCoV-080385d_. In (b) the yellow line corresponds to FN430414_ITA_90254_2005 -Turkey_GQ427174_TCoV_TX-GL_01; blue, FN430414_ITA_90254_2005 -GfCoV/FR/ 2011_; purple, Turkey_GQ427174_TCoV_TX -GL_01 -GfCoV/FR/2011_. The dotted lines show bootstrap cut-offs of 80 %. Very similar plots were observed for FrTCoV and GfCoV in that both viruses were grouped with Italy 2005 for the majority of the sequences leading up to the S gene and after the S gene to the end of the genome.",
