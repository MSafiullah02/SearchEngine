This article focuses on critical care preparedness aspects of disaster management by discussing what disaster scenarios should be considered, who should be involved in disaster preparedness, and some recommendations for preparedness efforts. Effective preparedness will increase the effectiveness of disaster mitigation, disaster response, and disaster recovery. Unfortunately, interest in disaster preparedness waxes and wanes depending on the temporal proximity of the latest disaster threat, and often focuses efforts on the last disaster instead of the next one.1\n",

The all-hazards approach takes into account generic threats to critical care demand and supply issues regardless of the cause of the disaster or surge event. The hazard-specific approach creates a plan that is tailored to a specific type of event. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are summarized in Table 1\n. An all-hazards approach has the advantage of being potentially applicable to all possible events; however, it may create a less effective response due to lack of planning for specific challenges (eg, dialysis resources for crush injury-related renal failure after a major earthquake). A hazard-specific approach works well for the disaster events considered during planning; however, an unexpected type of event may result in a challenging response in the early stages of the disaster until the response can be recalibrated.2\n",

For health care organizations, the Kaiser Permanente model provides an excellent example of such a framework and provides some online tools (such as their Hazard and Vulnerability Assessment Tool) to help hospitals prepare an HVA.3 Generating risk scores or rankings for different types of disaster events can help prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing on the most likely or most severe types of events, keeping in mind the need to maintain some level of all-hazards preparedness in case the HVA proves inaccurate or that a highly unlikely event occurs.",

Hazard-specific planning can include medications specific to address the hazard, such as antidotes for organophosphate poisoning, cyanide exposure treatment, or antiviral medications for pandemic influenza. The ICU-specific HVA can help pharmacists prioritize medication planning during disaster preparedness activities. Knowledge of factors such as shelf life of medications, need for special storage such as refrigeration, and costing helps pharmacists provide essential advice for procurement. Ideally, stockpiling strategies will avoid unnecessary availability of multiple drugs that can provide the same effect, such as having morphine and fentanyl and hydromorphone available as multiple narcotics. Pharmacy input for creation of preprinted order sets to be used during a disaster can help align prescribing by providers with the available drugs stockpiled. Finally, given that funds used for disaster preparedness take away from funds required for usual hospital expenses, pharmacy input on cost:benefit ratios of different medication options can help with a fiscally responsible approach to disaster planning and logistics.",

More detailed discussion of these issues can be found in other articles in this issue. Although prehospital and ED triage strategies should identify and support disaster victims with isolated psychological/mental health issues, nothing precludes the copresence of mental health injuries (novel or exacerbations of existing mental health diagnoses) with critical illness from physical causes. Planning for availability of psychiatry and other mental health consultation-liaison services should be considered to support patients requiring critical care after a disaster. Similarly, family members of critically ill patients will require ongoing support throughout the hospitalization of their loved ones, which may include need for social work and chaplaincy. Strategies to ensure effective communication and support of family members when patients require transfer out of the hospital for higher level of care or capacity reasons should be considered in planning efforts. Withdrawal of active life support may be required when patients are not benefiting from critical care support and/or if triage decision making requires shifting of resources to patients more likely to benefit, and the involvement of clinical ethicists to support patients, families, and staff members can be very helpful thus requiring consideration during planning.9 An emerging concept in disaster planning incorporates the concept of mental health/stress inoculation for hospital staff, which may include advance and just-in-time deployment to increase performance during the disaster and prevent long-term psychological effects.10, 11\n",

From a laboratory perspective, disaster planning should incorporate strategies for triaging of laboratory study requests to maximize time-sensitive results impacting on critical clinical decision making. Use of existing or stockpiled portable point-of-care laboratory equipment that can be operated by frontline clinical staff can be considered to reduce burden on the laboratory team. Bedside clinical monitoring may be used as a laboratory test mitigation strategy in some cases, such as the use of pulse oximetry and quantitative capnography for ventilated patients instead of arterial blood gas testing, or advanced pulse oximeters that can measure carbon monoxide levels as a screening strategy in mass casualty carbon monoxide exposure.18 Certain high-priority threats identified by the ICU-specific HVA may warrant specific discussion with laboratory services to ensure availability of necessary hazard-specific testing if possible. Blood bank services in particular will need to coordinate with critical care and other hospital services to prepare for mass casualty events placing excessive demands for blood products, including a strategy to triage blood product requests in extreme cases.",

Ensuring that appropriate physical plant and space is available, along with information technology support, will reduce some challenges with regard to working in non-ICU space. Understanding of space capabilities, with the input of facilities engineers, can help with the appropriate planning choices for ICU surge space within the hospital and help avoid unpleasant surprises, such as lack of emergency backup power outlets, sufficient medical gas supply, or other limitations. A particular concern is the availability of negative-pressure airborne isolation rooms in the event of a serious airborne-spread biohazard disaster. Most hospitals have limited airborne isolation capacity during usual operations. During hospital surge experiences during the worldwide 2012 to 2013 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, some facilities were able to modify airflow and erect barriers to create large negative-pressure isolation wards, including ICUs.21 Planning for various scenarios identified in the ICU-specific HVA should identify potential physical facility gaps and prompt mitigation strategies.",

Planning for the transition from the initial crisis phase of a disaster with mass casualties to integration of patients within the electronic medical record will help ensure timely and accurate access and creation of health provider notes, laboratory results, and diagnostic imaging reports. Information technology services should also plan for additional need of mobile computers and sufficient wireless network access to manage critically ill patients outside of the usual ICU space.

Specific consideration of the security needs of the critical care areas (traditional and makeshift) is occasionally overlooked. Intense emotional reactions of family and friends of critically ill patients can occur and be compounded in a stressful disaster situation. In the event of implementation of triage activities and a shift from usual standards of care, decisions to withdraw life support from those patients not benefiting from scarce resources can be met with violent objection. Physical measures to limit access to the critical care areas may need enhancement, and there may also be a need for greater visible presence of security staff as a deterrent to unacceptable treatment of hospital staff. Liaison with security staff should be included as part of the critical care disaster planning process to avoid gaps in security capability.",

Increasingly, hospitals are appointing a lead for disaster preparedness who can act as a liaison between clinicians and administration.

Fortunately, those disaster events are uncommon, but, unfortunately, we cannot rely only on actual disaster events to test plans and maintain disaster competency among hospital staff. Frequent disaster exercises can help educate staff on how to function during an actual event, and provide feedback to disaster planners allowing plan improvement before a disaster. Disaster exercises may vary in scale and fidelity (Fig. 1\n). The scale of a disaster exercise may be limited to a single critical care unit, involve multiple hospital services, or be expanded to a regional, state, or even national scale. The fidelity of a disaster exercise may be tabletop-based, using patient cards and virtual clinical spaces; may take into account current actual clinical volumes and bed availability; or may use hundreds of actors playing the role of patients, combined with high-fidelity patient simulators, scattered throughout actual areas of the hospital for an in-situ exercise.23 Exercises of greater fidelity and greater scale consume more resources to conduct, and may be more likely to interfere with routine hospital operations. However, the greater the fidelity and the greater the scale, the more likely it will be to identify opportunities for improvement in disaster planning. Thus, a balance of these factors must take into account local resources, support for disaster preparedness by hospital leadership, and mandatory activities required for hospital accreditation or government funding.",

Critical care leaders and staff should understand the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS)24 as organized in their hospital, and know how they interface with the HICS. Critical care would normally fit within the Operations branch, under control of the Operations Chief. In some cases, leadership roles within the HICS may be filled by critical care leaders given their broad clinical understanding of the hospital as a whole; however, their responsibilities would be guided by the HICS role rather than keeping a narrow focus on critical care. Depending on the nature of the disaster event, critical care leaders and clinicians may be asked to assist the HICS leadership team as subject matter experts, or participate in task forces or strike groups designed to handle specific problems. Certain principles of the HICS can be useful in disaster planning on a smaller scale specific to critical care. The concept of span of control, having everyone report to only 1 person, and each person only having 5 to 7 people reporting to them, may be helpful in organizing clinical teams including non-ICU staff supervised by ICU clinicians. Also, the concept of job action sheets that provide guidance for key actions given a particular role can be helpful in reminding staff of key tasks during a stressful disaster event, and can be a valuable teaching tool during an exercise.",

Exercise and evaluation of advanced infection control strategies (such as conversion to negative-pressure clinical areas, use of infection control coaches), or advanced personal protective equipment (such as powered air-purifying respirator use, safe donning and doffing of equipment) may be of special significance for critical care team preparedness. Exercises should also encourage familiarity with stockpile equipment, such as monitoring equipment or unfamiliar ventilators, so that there is some retention of competency in the event of the need to use such equipment in a disaster event.
