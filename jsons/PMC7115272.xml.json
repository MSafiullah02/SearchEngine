The term EHR has often been used interchangeably with EMR (electronic medical records) even though there are minor but significant differences between the 2 terms. EMR is the older term in use and is often associated with electronic patient record systems within an institution. EHR is usually considered the term most reflective of the actual patient experience of receiving health care across institutions. We chose to use the term EHR instead of EMR to reflect the growing consensus toward a need for interoperable electronic records.",

Health information and data and results management allow for an efficient view of patients' past records including medications, allergies, past admissions, and laboratory and microbiology results. Electronic communication enables better coordination of care plan among multiple providers and ancillary services as well as timely notification of critical patient data. Administrative processes such as scheduling and billing increase the efficiency of heath care organizations, provide timely service to patients, and decrease the paperwork.7\n",

Order management includes functions such as computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which allows electronic entry of laboratory, medications, and radiology orders instead of orders being recorded on paper sheets or prescription pads. The electronic entry allows clinical decision support (CDS) functions to compare the order against standards for dosing, allergies, and others and warn the physician about potential problems. Patient support means providing tools such as patient portals or personalized health records (PHRs), which give patients access to their health records, provide patient education, and help patients carry out home monitoring and self-testing. This can empower patients and help improve control of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. Reporting and population health management support the use of already collected electronic data in EHR for uses other than clinical care. Quality management, outcomes reporting, and infectious disease surveillance are included in this category.",

In addition, CDS also includes reminders, prompts, and alerts to improve compliance with best clinical practices and hyperlinks that can provide context-specific drug or disease information to the provider at the point of care. Studies have shown that properly designed CPOE and CDS can lead to as much as 85% reduction in serious medication errors.10 Other system-wide benefits from fully functional EHRs include increased compliance with preventive care guidelines, better coordination and management of chronic conditions, improvement in quality indicators for pay-for-performance initiatives, reduced staff time spent on paperwork, reduced number of duplicate or unnecessary laboratory and imaging orders, and increased accuracy and timeliness of billing.11\n",

CDS can also be customized to generate reminders to enhance vaccination rates and preventive screening that have shown to be more effective and less expensive than the paper-based reminders.11, 12 It is estimated that such computerized reminders to providers at the point of care can lead to a 6.1% to 28.4% increase in preventive health activities such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations.12\n",

In addition, patients who always received the regimens recommended by the computer program had reduced length of the stay (adjusted mean, 10.0 vs 12.9 days, respectively; P < .001) and total hospital costs (adjusted mean, $26,315 vs $35,283, respectively; P < .001). In a separate study, the authors reported that the percentage of patients having surgery who received appropriately timed preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis increased from 40% to 99.1%, and the antibiotic-associated adverse drug events decreased by 30%. During the study, antimicrobial resistance patterns were stable, and mortality rates decreased from 3.65% in 1988 to 2.65% in 1994 (P < .001). The authors concluded that computer-assisted decision support programs can improve antibiotic use, reduce associated costs, and stabilize the emergence of MDRO.14\n",

If properly designed, EHRs and related Health IT can also help in data analysis by identifying abnormal distributions of variables from large interrelated databases.18 This has shown to be more efficient (requiring one third to one sixth the amount of time required by standard surveillance methods) and effective in screening potential outbreaks as well as finding and reporting endemic HAI.18, 19 With current emphasis on mandatory reporting of HAI and requirement by some states to perform house-wide surveillance, EHRs and related information technologies provide a unique opportunity to support the paradigm shift to automated surveillance strategies, which allow ICPs to minimize time spent finding HAI and to maximize time spent preventing them (\nFig 3).20\n",

The effectiveness of this approach has also been reported by Gransden et al, who found that two thirds of patients readmitted to the hospital were not known to be previously infected by the admitting staff and were instead alerted by the computerized system.22 Early identification of patients at risk, such as at the time of hospital admission, allows ICPs to conduct active surveillance and take prompt contact precautions if needed to prevent nosocomial spread.23 This strategy has been found to be cost-effective and supported by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA).23, 24\n",

The CARP data warehouse has been used in regular surveillance activities such as determining rates of HAI, central venous catheter use, and antimicrobial resistance as well as for quality improvement activities. These investigations as well as others highlight potential applications that utilize increased convergence between EHRs and laboratory and pharmacy information systems for electronic reporting of endemic and syndromic conditions in the population.26, 27\n",

It is also useful to assess whether the system uses data exchange and messaging standards that can automate data collection from EHRs and existing Health IT and facilitate reporting to public agencies. Although automation enhances efficiency, it does not by itself lead to more accurate data. Overt reliance on administrative or billing databases can lead to inaccurate and misleading reporting.35, 36 Hence, due diligence should be exercised to confirm the accuracy of data and associated processes so as to meet the requirements of an epidemiologically sound surveillance system.15, 16\n",
