Extracellular pathogens release specific toxins or proteins which triggers the production of antibodies. On the other hand, intracellular infections reside within the cells of the body\u2019s defence system the reticuloendothelial system (RES). The normal body response to a pathogen is rapid opsonisation followed by phagocytosis, which results in killing and clearing of the microorganism. Intracellular infections result when the organisms cleverly evade destruction following phagocytosis. The intracellular location of these microorganisms protects them from the host defence mechanisms, such as antibodies or complement, and from the action of drugs that are unable to penetrate the cell efficiently. Hence, while adequate drug concentrations are readily achieved at extracellular infection sites to enable efficient therapy, intracellular infections are more difficult to treat. Some common intracellular and extracellular infectious diseases and their causative organisms are listed in Table 3.1.\n",

            "text": "Opsonisation is the process by which bacteria are altered by opsonins so as to become more readily and efficiently engulfed by phagocytosis. Opsonisation is mediated by the complement system: C3b, C4b, and iC3b, antibodies IgG and IgM and mannose-binding lectin. Mannose binding lectin initiates the formation of C3b. Opsonisation of particles enables recognition by the Fc receptors, complement receptors or specific receptors for phagocytosis. Opsonins are generally proteins which can bind to pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) or other specific receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages. Pentraxins [C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P] [1], mindin, collectins [2] and ficolins [3] are such opsonins. The function of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) is to recognise and enhance phagocytosis of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), specific patterns present on microbial pathogens like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, lipotechoic acid (LTA) in Gram-positive bacteria and mannans in yeast. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are PRRs essential for recognition of microbial components such as TLR4 (LPS) [4\u20136], TLR3 [double-stranded RNA] [7], TLR6 [mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipopeptide\u20142 kDa] [8], TLR9 [CpG bacterial DNA] [9], TLR5 [bacterial flagellin] [10], and TLR2 [peptidoglycan]. However, the exact mechanisms of TLR recognition of microbial components remain unclear.",

            "text": "Opsonisation facilitates adherence of pathogens to macrophages, and is facilitated by integrins. Adherence induces membrane protrusions, called pseudopodia, to extend around the attached material. Following fusion with the macrophage, the pseudopodia forms a phagosome that encloses the pathogen within a membrane, which then enters the endocytic process. Phagosomes coalesce with intracellular organelles to mature into phagolysosomes, which have an acidic environment with many digestive proteins which finally degrades the internalised material. Phagocytised material is eliminated by exocytosis. The process of phagocytosis is mediated by several proteins such as actin, dynamin and cortactin. While actin is connected to the lipidic membrane and responsible for invagination of the membrane to form the endosome, cortactin is an actin-binding protein which stimulates its polymerisation. Dynamin hydrolyses guanidine triphosphate and uses the resulting energy for the contraction of actin and formation of endosome. Particulates that cannot be digested remain sequestered in residual bodies within the cell. Other cells such as fibroblast, endothelial and epithelial cells also exhibit phagocytic activity and can engulf microbes like Shigella, Listeria and Yersinia [11]. Such phagocytosis is mediated by laminin and fibronectin receptors/heparan sulfate present on the membrane surface [11]. However, the major cells responsible for phagocytosis are macrophages.",

M1 macrophages are stimulated by interferon (IFN)-g or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to release nitric oxide (NO), important for killing intracellular pathogens. Activated macrophages are characterised by expression of major histocompatibility molecule like MHC class II and CD86 and their ability to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-1b, IL-12, IL-18 and the chemokines CCL15, CCL20, CXCL8-11 and CXCL13 [14]. Activated M1 macrophages facilitate killing of microorganisms by endocytosis, synthesising reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), limiting the uptake of nutrients and iron essential for the growth of bacteria and replication of viruses, or production of nitric oxide facilitated by IFN-g-inducible NO synthase (iNOS).",

Transformation of primary endosomes into phagolysosomes is prevented by a number of actions that occur simultaneously. These include reduced levels of proton ATPase inside the endosomes [18] removal of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) [16] and coupling of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [53]. The M. tuberculosis cell envelop comprises mycolic acid which can interact with cholesterol in the plasma membrane [50]. Further, mycobacteria are taken up inside macrophages by multiple receptors. The complement receptors are among the most widely used receptors for mycobacteria, for both opsonised and non-opsonised entry [54\u201356]. Other receptors are mannose receptors that bind glycosylated structures on the bacterial surface [57]. Fc receptors that can internalise IgG-opsonised bacteria [58] and scavenger receptors [59, 60] have also been implicated in mycobacterial uptake. Uptake of mycobacteria by the complement receptor pathway protects it from the aggressive lysosomal compartment ensuring relatively hospitable conditions.",

Further, C. neoformans evade phagocytic uptake by phenotypic switching. This mechanism is observed in yeast cells that express glucuronoxylomannan mucoid capsule that resist phagocytic uptake and cause high lethality in mice [72]. In case of Aspergillus conidia infection collectins, pentraxin proteins are essential for opsonisation, but their deficiency is responsible for high susceptibility to infection in immunocompetent mice. Furthermore, several enzymes such as elastases and proteases released by the fungus enable conidia to escape from phagocytic uptake by alveolar macrophages.",

Interaction of the membrane-bound antibody present on mature B cells with the antigen, as well as the interactions of the antigen with macrophages and T cells, results in B-cell clones of corresponding specificity. Repeated division of the B cell over 4\u20135 days generates a population of memory cells and plasma cells. Further plasma cells, are responsible for synthesis and secretion of antibody.",

TCR recognises virus infected cells and cancer cells. However, unlike B cells, TCR does not recognise free antigen, unless it is bound to MHC molecules on the membrane of antigen presenting cells. The main function of T cells is to induce death of virus infected cells by secretion of cytotoxins and cytokines which activates B cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells.

Epithelial cells bind together to form the epithelial tissue which is held together by adherens, tight junctions, gap junctions and desmosomes. The functions of epithelial cells are boundary and protection of vital organs, transportation, absorption, secretion, lubrication and movement.

Certain cells in a biofilm adapt a different and protected phenotype. Biofilms are resistant to antibodies, phagocytes, and antibiotics. Although phagocytes reach the biofilms, they become frustrated and release their enzymes, which cause damage to the tissue around the biofilm. Release of bacteria through the damaged biofilm results in dissemination of the infection, leading to acute infection in the surrounding tissues [110, 111].",

As efflux pumps can be specific for one substrate or for drugs of dissimilar structure, they can be associated with multi-drug resistance. Multi-drug-resistance efflux pumps are a known cause for the development of bacterial resistance against antibiotics. Bacterial efflux-pump proteins related with MDR are divided into five families namely the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the multi-drug and toxic-compound extrusion (MATE) family, the small multi-drug resistance (SMR) family and the resistance nodulation division (RND) family [112]. Multi-drug resistance occurs, when efflux proteins are overexpressed on the cell, and easily identify and efficiently expel a broad range of antibiotics from the cells [113]. Gram-negative bacteria express several families of transporters which cause resistance [114]. Gram-positive bacteria mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae express MDR efflux pumps. S. aureus (responsible for skin and soft-tissue infections) overexpress MFS efflux pump NorA which enables resistance to chloramphenicol and fluoroquinolones. The S. pneumoniae MFS efflux pumpPmrA exports the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and also expels the dyes acriflavine and ethidium bromide [115\u2013117] Escherichia coli EmrE express a member of the small multi-drug resistance (SMR) superfamily and AcrAB\u2013TolC, a member of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily.

Asymmetric polymer lipid nanostructures (LIPOMER) of Doxycycline hydrochloride (DH) in the range of (250\u2013400 nm) [171] revealed enhanced splenic delivery. The irregular shape of the LIPOMER coupled with rigidity resulted in filtration and non-phagocytic accumulation to reveal splenotropy in sinusoidal spleen models, rat, rabbit and dog.

Hydrophobic nanocarriers are readily coated by complement proteins, albumin, and immunoglobulin and scavenged by RES [174]. Surface charge of particles also influences interaction and stability with cells [175]. Reports suggest that positively charged particles showed high phagocytic uptake over negatively charged particles probably due to better interaction with the negatively charged cell membrane. Cationic and neutral nanocarriers are less taken up by RES as compare to negatively charge [176\u2013178]. However, negatively charged nanoparticles can potentially attach to cationic sites on the macrophages namely the scavenger receptors, which facilitate their uptake by RES [179].",

Each approach exhibits different binding and internalisation mechanisms. Further, the predominant uptake mechanism is often dictated by the nature of the ligand. Receptor mediated processes are relatively slower than phagocytic processes, with the ligand playing an important role. The sizes, geometry, charge and density of the ligand significantly influences receptor mediated endocytosis [183]. For more references readers can refer to [182, 184, 185].

Date et al. developed folate anchored polymeric nanoparticles of rifampicin and demonstrated 480 % enhancement in rifampicin uptake as compared to 300 % in the absence of folate in the human macrophage cell line U-937 [226]. Folate receptors enable flotillin-1 and caveolin receptor mediated endocytosis, thereby bypassing normal phagolysome formation to deliver the nanocarriers into the cytoplasm [191]. Lemmer et al. developed mycolic acid (MA) anchored nanoparticles (NP) of isoniazid. MA nanoparticles exhibited macrophage uptake, possibly localising in the cytoplasm. Verma et al. developed inhalable microparticles containing NO donors for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Such inhalable microparticles specifically delivered NO donors inside macrophages and showed sustain release in the cytosol. The antimycobacterial activity of microparticles was confirmed by the decrease in the M. tuberculosis CFU by up to 3-log in 24 h. The activity could be attributed to interaction of NO with bacterial DNA, lipids and protein. This strategy could be considered practical as the doses of NO donors (isosorbide nitrate) were much lower than those required for cardiovascular effects [240].",

Entry of the parasite into the brain causes cerebral malaria. Malaria can be targeted at the exoerythrocytic stage by targeting RBCs, or targeting the hypnozoites to tackle malarial relapse and further in case of cerebral malaria targeting the brain. Increased permeability of infected RBCs is seen after 12\u201316 h of plasmodium invasion through formation of channels. These channels are \u201cnew permeability pathways\u201d (NPPs) which allow entry of molecules such as dextran, protein A and IgG2a antibody thereby differentiating the non-infected and infected RBCs. Such pathways could be targeted to enable high drug loading in the erythrocytes specifically through design of nanocarriers of <80 nm [241]. This could be supported through design of stealth nanocarriers which could enable long circulation, using various stealth agents like poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG), Pluronic, etc. [242]. Chloroquine liposomes anchored with anti-erythrocyte F (ab\u2032)2 were studied for targeting to erythrocytes [243]. Hepatocytes the residence of hypnozoites expresses the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is overexpressed in infections. Targeting this receptor using nanocarriers anchored with ASGPR ligands is a strategy for hepatocyte targeting. Joshi et al. prepared in situ primaquine nanocarboplex of primaquine phosphate anchored with pullulan as the ASGPR ligand for specific targeting to hepatocytes. Significantly, enhanced hepatic accumulation with preferential accumulation in the hepatocytes and a high hepatocytes/nonparenchymal cells ratio of 75:25 confirmed hepatocyte targeting [244]. Transferrin (Tf)-anchored solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were intravenously administered for targeting quinine dihydrochloride to the brain, in cerebral malaria. Compared to conventional SLNs or drug solution the Tf-SLNs significantly enhanced the brain uptake of quinine [234].",

The typical reservoirs are the liver, spleen, lungs, GIT and genital tract with the brain and bone marrow representing remote sites [246]. Targeted delivery for HIV therefore needs to address delivery to maximum sites simultaneously to achieve remission. One strategy that we propose is a combination of nanocarriers of size <100 nm to target remote sites and size >200 nm target major RES organs (Unpublished data). Viral replication is inhibited by the antioxidant glutathione. Erythrocytes containing glutathione (GSH) in combination with azidothymidine (AZT) and didanosine (DDI) showed higher reduction in viral DNA in bone marrow and brain as compared to DDI + GSH alone [247]. Immunoliposomes containing siRNA for targeting the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin, which is expressed on all leukocytes, was selectively taken up by T cells and macrophages, the primary site of HIV. Further, in vivo administration of anti-CCR5 siRNA resulted in leukocyte-specific gene silencing that was sustained for 10 days [248]. Nanogels comprising non-reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRITs) decorated with a peptide for brain specific apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors, showed tenfold suppression of retroviral activity and decrease inflammation in humanised mouse model of HIV-1 infection in the brain [249].",

            "text": "Targeted drug delivery for the therapy of veterinary infections assumes immense importance not only for improved animal health but due to the challenges posed by zoonotic diseases. About 13 zoonotic diseases including brucellosis, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis and others are related to 2.4 billion cases of infection in humans and over two million deaths annually [166, 167]. Such infections exist both in domestic animals and wild life. The close proximity of humans especially with such domestic animals is a cause of global concern. The WHO policy of \u201cCull and Kill\u201d results not only in the loss of lives but also heavy monetary losses to the farmer. Targeted treatment strategies using nanodrug delivery systems could provide a revolutionary strategy to benefit both the animals and man. The benefits of targeted nanomedicine strategies are slowly gaining recognition as evident from a number of reported studies. Liposomes have been used by many researchers for treating various veterinary diseases such as Leishmaniasis [250, 251], Brucellosis [252], Blastomycosis [253], Babesiosis [254], etc. Patil et al. [171] developed an asymmetric lipomer. This is a combination of polymer\u2013lipid containing doxycycline which could have application in the treatment of intracellular infections that are primarily resident in the spleen like brucellosis, ehrlichiosis, etc. A number of studies are reported on horses infected with babesiosis, Streptococcus equi, T. gondii and Strongylus vulgaris infections using liposomes [254], polymeric nanospheres [255], dendrimers [256] and micelles [257] respectively. A recent study revealed the improved therapy of theileiriosis in cattle with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) of buparvaquone [258]. SLN revealed comparable effect with the intramuscular injection at significantly lower doses. Nanodrug delivery systems have also been evaluated in dogs, sheep and pigs. For details on nanodrug delivery applications in targeted delivery in veterinary infections, readers are directed to the following reference [259].",

A rate-limiting factor however would be the serious concerns of toxicity. Nanodrug delivery systems due to their high intracellular delivery could precipitate new and unknown toxicities. Evolving strategies to predict the same is an important path forward. While vaccines could probably provide the ultimate cure and control, vaccine development is a complex process and not yet easily attained as evident from the limited success stories. However, designing nano-vaccines targeted to exhibit greater cellular response is also a near future prospect.",
