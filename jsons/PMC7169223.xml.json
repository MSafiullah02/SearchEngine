Ultimately, 8,096 cases of SARS were identified in 29 countries or areas and 774 patients reportedly died.(\n\n1\n\n) The rapid transmission and high mortality rate made SARS a global threat for which no efficacious therapy was available and empirical strategies had to be used to treat the patients.",

In parallel, mathematical models expressing the SARS propagation from person to person have been developed to discuss countermeasures against such a disease transmission from community to national scales.(\n\n4\n, \n5\n\n) These models successfully explained the epidemic curve by estimating model parameters of infectious rate, removal rate, and so on. However, these models did not incorporate primary exposures or transmission via environmental reservoirs and the model parameters would not be consistent and highly influenced by numerous factors in environment and human behavior. Such models with parameters estimated on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis are of little use in any outbreaks occurring in other situations. On the other hand, dose\u2010response models to characterize the interaction between human and virus seems robust and applicable to assessing the risk of SARS via any possible routes of infection (e.g., aerosols containing virus particles, surface or hand contamination). Nevertheless, no dose\u2010response model for SARS\u2010CoV is available at the moment mainly due to unavailability of data sets challenging humans or animals with this virus.",

SARS was the first example of serious illness in humans caused by coronaviruses.(\n\n7\n\n) Since the outbreak in 2003, many researchers have worked to elucidate structures of viral genes and proteins, mechanisms of infection and replication, and its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are divided into three groups (groups I to III) based on the genome sequences and SARS\u2010CoV may be a member of group II as well as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), equine coronavirus, and human coronavirues OC43 and NL63, which also cause respiratory infections.

This virus infects and replicates in mice, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and several species of nonhuman primates (cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, African green monkeys, and marmosets). Nevertheless, most attempts to reproduce completely human clinical disease and pathological findings in these animals failed. On the other hand, De Albuquerque et al.\n(\n\n9\n\n) demonstrated that intranasal infection of A/J mice with MHV\u20101 produced pulmonary pathological features of SARS. From the fact that all MHV\u20101\u2010infected A/J mice developed progressive interstitial pneumonitis, including dense macrophage infiltrates, giant cells, and hyaline membranes, resulting in death of all animals, they concluded that A/J mice infected with MHV\u20101 would be a potentially useful small animal model of human SARS that defines its pathogenesis and suggests treatment strategies. We employed the data set (2 in Table I) challenging A/J mice with MHV\u20101 as a surrogate data set for SARS\u2010CoV. The data set was obtained by monitoring the survival of four groups of the mice (n= 5 per group) for 21 days after intranasal inoculation with MHV\u20101 at 5, 50, 500, and 5,000 PFU, respectively. In other approaches, transgenic (tg) mice expressing the human receptor for SARS\u2010CoV, which are very susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV, have been developed and used for pathogenesis studies.(\n\n10\n\n) DeDiego et al.\n(\n\n11\n\n) reported a data set for infection of the tg mice with recombinant SARS\u2010CoV (1 in Table I). In their experiment, four groups of the tg mice (n= 2 to 6 per group) were intranasally inoculated with 240, 800, 2,400, and 12,000 PFU of rSARS\u2010CoV, respectively, and the survival was monitored 13 days.

Since neither infection nor illness of mice has been analyzed in these experiments, we assumed that all mice with the illness died. In general, mortality of animals with severe illness like SARS would be dependent on their physical strength, which indicates a potential of recovery from the illness, and availability of medical treatment. As described above, a high mortality was observed during the SARS outbreak, although the patients were treated with some empirical strategies. In the experiments using mice, higher mortality can be expected since the mice developing illness had never received any medical treatments and basically the physical strength of mice would be much lower than that of humans. This could support the above assumption and therefore we decided to use the data sets 1 and 2 to develop the dose\u2010response model with the endpoint of human illness, that is, SARS.",

According to the report by Department of Health (DOH), Hong Kong SAR, the outbreak was begun with an index case who visited his family living on the 16th floor in Block E of Amoy Gardens.(\n\n20\n, \n21\n\n) He stayed overnight and used the toilet there. DOH concluded that the sewage contamination associated with the index case (and other infected persons) excreting coronavirus that gained entry to households through the bathroom floor drain with dried U\u2010traps was the primary cause of the SARS outbreak. The building's ventilation system made a significant contribution to the entry of virus into households. According to McKinney et al.,(\n\n22\n\n) many residents had installed high\u2010powered fans in their small bathrooms with capacities 6 to 10 times higher than the required capacity and the fans created large negative pressure and drew air from waste pipes. The WHO environmental team verified that sewer gas and aerosolized droplets, which the hydraulic action caused by flushing toilets generated, were being drawn into the bathrooms from the waste pipe system. Although DOH mentioned other possible causes of the SARS outbreak, such as person\u2010to\u2010person transmission, vectors acting as mechanical carriers for the virus, and environmental contamination, we assumed that all cases were infected via the airborne transmission, reported as the primary cause, in our model application.",

We tested the null hypothesis that the beta\u2010Poisson model provided a statistically significant improvement in fit to these data sets rather than a more parsimonious (exponential) model by comparing the difference of variance between two models against the critical value (3.84) on the chi\u2010square distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

ID10 and ID50 of SARS\u2010CoV were 43 (95% CI = 20 to 81 PFU) and 280 PFU (95% CI = 130 to 530 PFU), respectively. The doses (ID10= 2.0 TCD50; ID50= 13 TCD50) for HCoV\u2010229E seem relatively low; however, Schmidt et al.\n(\n\n24\n\n) reported that the 50% endpoint assay was about 10 to 30 times less sensitive than the plaque assay with HCoV\u2010229E. Accordingly, the estimated infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV would be comparable to that of HCoV that causes a mild cold in humans. Similar infectivity was also observed in data sets of three\u2010day\u2010old mice infected with MHV\u2010S (data set 4) and eight\u2010week\u2010old rats infected with HEV\u201067N (data set 14). These animal coronaviruses belong to the same genetic group as SARS\u2010CoV. The infectivity of coronavirus might be related to the viral evolution, although a lot of unknown factors exist. The effect of host age was observed in data sets for MHV\u2010S (data sets 4 to 6) and HEV\u201067N (data sets 9 to 14) and it was obvious that young mice and rats are more susceptible than old ones. In contrast, infection among children and adolescents was relatively uncommon(\n\n25\n\n) and the mortality of senior people was comparatively high in the SARS pandemic.(\n\n26\n\n) This age\u2010dependency of human susceptibility to SARS\u2010CoV is different not only from other coronaviruses but also from other human respiratory viruses. Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is a highly virulent respiratory virus like SARS\u2010CoV. The epidemiologic investigations show that this virus primarily infects young people and Goicoechea(\n\n27\n\n) made a comment that the receptor recognized by this virus, which is expressed in the lower respiratory tract, may be expressed in the upper airway in children, increasing the risk of infection. In case of respiratory syncytial virus (SRV), another well\u2010known human respiratory virus, the serious forms of the disease (principally bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia) are found most frequently in infants under six months of age and the disease is progressively milder with increasing age.(\n\n28\n\n)\n",

As Yu et al.\n(\n\n23\n\n) analyzed, the attack rate was dependent on the floor and the middle floors between levels 14 and 23 had the highest risk since the flat where the index case visited was located there. Therefore, the estimated dose of SARS\u2010CoV (63 to 160 PFU) for residents on the middle floor was also higher than the others. The estimated dose (42 to 117 PFU) for residents on the upper floor was slightly higher than that (16 to 49 PFU) on the lower floor. Li et al.\n(\n\n21\n\n) explained the reason as that viral particles were probably transmitted with upflow air movements between flats in this block. He and his colleagues(\n\n23\n\n) have confirmed through air modeling that the exhaust fans propelled virus\u2010laden air into an outside air shaft, where it was carried upward by natural air currents and into other flats on the upper floor through open windows. Based on our estimate of dose, this transmission mode appears highly plausible, although we have been unable to locate data on viral load in either fecal matter or wastewater.",

Mice receiving a dose higher than 103.9 TCID50 of the virus died and the 50% lethal dose (LD50) was 104.6 TCID50. In contrast, ID50 of 2.8 \u00d7 102 PFU estimated with the developed model is low. Since ordinary SARS\u2010CoV cannot cause the death of mice, there is a possibility that the virulence of the virus was still low even after its adaptation to mice.",

Number of gene copies has not been related yet to the plaque\u2010forming capability of this virus; however, there is no doubt that a huge amount of infectious viruses was excreted from patients for a certain period. According to the DOH report, at the beginning of the outbreak in Block E, a part of infectious viruses excreted from the index case must have reached other households through the waste pipe and ventilation systems. Considering this virus transportation, we can imagine that residents at the households inhaled small doses of SARS\u2010CoV (Table III) as estimated here by model application, although there are several unknown factors such as virus dispersion and inactivation during transportation.",

In these recent cases, fortunately, all patients only developed mild symptoms and secondary transmission did not occur since the animal virus had not fully adapted in humans yet. In addition to SARS\u2010CoV, two novel CoVs (HCoV\u2010NL63 and HCoV\u2010HKU1) that cause respiratory illness in humans were identified after the SARS outbreak.
