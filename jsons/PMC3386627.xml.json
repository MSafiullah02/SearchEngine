Low pathogenicity may be due to coevolution of host and virus [11], and this may lead to a decrease in virus shedding, thus hampering isolation and propagation of live virus from environmental samples [12,13,14]. To facilitate epidemiological and biochemical studies of viruses adapted to fruit bats we immortalized primary cells from the Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and obtained the cell lines R06E, R05T and R05R [15]. Immortalization was achieved by transfection of the E1 region of human adenovirus 5. No artificial selection with antibiotics was applied at any time during the cell line generation process, and serial passaging confirmed complete immortalization.",

Thereafter, R06E and R05T were provided to several laboratories until we realized that the supplied R06E cultures were not from Egyptian rousette but appeared to be Vero cells, suggesting either a contamination of the distributed R06E vials or an accidental switch of cell lines. During the investigation of this event we refined methods for detection of cross-species contamination and authentication of the fruit bat cell lines. We also observed unexpected properties in intentionally-spiked cultures, an ability for occluded contamination that we consider to be important due to the wide distribution of Vero cells, and present data suggesting that cell subpassage protocols and incubation temperature of infected cultures may be contributing parameters for successful isolation of viruses from field samples or recovery of recombinant viruses.",

PCR fragment patterns are complex after amplification of minisatellites by a YNZ22 primer. This complexity allows the clear identification of cell lines and the ability to distinguish related cultures once reliable fingerprints have been established. The disadvantages are that contamination could be masked by the greater number of signals and that amplification conditions may influence the reliability of the obtained pattern [18]. To detect contamination in previously untested cell lines, changes in patterns have to be monitored over several passages, with the caveat that if original and contaminating cell lines are in equilibrium, a shift to one cell line may not be observed.",

One culture was subpassaged twice weekly by 10-fold dilution and the other culture once weekly by 20-fold dilution. Both protocols reflect common cell culture maintenance procedures. To track relative Vero.GFP content with each passage, fluorescence images were taken, FACS performed (at lower passages GFP-positive cells were counted by eye) and genomic DNA isolated for PCR against MACF1. As shown in Figure 3, the ratio of GFP-positive to -negative cells remained at a constant low level if cells are passaged twice a week. Detection of Vero.GFP cells with MACF1-PCR in this cell culture was not possible. However, when passaged only once a week Vero.GFP cells had already overwhelmed R06E cells after 7 passages of cell culture.

The sensitivity of the method described here suggests that contamination can remain undetected until levels of 10\u201320% are reached. A similar threshold value is reported for isoenzyme analysis [35]. The PCR fragment pattern is more complex after amplification of minisatellites using the YNZ22 primer and thus suitable to contribute to genetic fingerprints of cell lines. The disadvantages are that contamination could be masked by the greater number of bands unless more precise methods such as capillary electrophoresis is applied to resolve the pattern, and that only cell lines with established genetic fingerprints can be authenticated. A conventional PCR with primers against MACF1 should point to interspecies contamination in mammalian cell cultures even if expected PCR fragment patterns are not known as any double band alerts to a potential problem. With respect to further authentication of our Rousettus cell lines, sequence of ND2 and suitable primers are shown in Figure 2.",

The potential for insidious contamination by Vero is unexpected and deserves attention. R06E is a fully established cell line and there appears to be no visible advantage for Vero.GPF cultures as lag phase and maximum cell densities are similar for the two cell lines, with replication even slightly faster for R06E. Vero cells derived from the World Health Organization 87-10 Cell Seed Bank have been tested for tumorigenicity and adventitious agents at low passage levels and are considered to be safe for vaccine production. However, capacity for cell migration and invasive phenotype has been described for this spontaneously immortalized cell line to increase with generation number [37], and the Vero cultures tested here are at high passage levels. For this reason, we suspect that very subtle differences in contact inhibition may allow Vero.GFP to continue cell division and accumulate where R06E enters cell cycle arrest.

Appropriate variations in splitting procedures during blind passaging may support proliferation of positive cells and thereby eventual recovery of a virus that otherwise may remain undetected. A potential molecular mechanism for such a model could be found at critical nodes of crosstalk between cell cycle (modulated by splitting procedure or viral factors [40]) and innate immunity. One such node is occupied by the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors: activity of NF-\u03baB changes with phase of the cell cycle [41,42] and at the same time this factor from within innate immunity and inflammation cascades interferes with [43] or augments [44] replication of certain viruses, and may even modulate latency [45].",

As an example, for Vero cells it has been described that splitting procedures influence emergence of tumorigenicity [46]. This observation may be related to the results summarized here if the population is heterogenous at onset, and if different phenotypes, such as low or absent tumorigenicity, react differently to initial or final cell densities. Such a potential heterogeneity has been described for another cell line important in vaccine research, the Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) [47]. Mixed phenotypes are probably without consequences in most experiments, but may confound some interpretation if results of distant relatives of the same cell line are compared across laboratories.",

These results are confirmed but another unexpected property of R06E cells compared to the R05T was observed: permissivity of R06E cells for MVA increased to expected levels at lower cultivation temperature. Vero cells remained non-permissive for MVA at low temperature, and the rhabdovirus VSIV replicated efficiently in R06E at normal and low cultivation temperatures. This specific example of virus-host interaction is unexpected and suggests that for adaptation or rescue of viruses from environmental samples, lower incubation temperatures should be included in the experimental variations to increase efficiencies.",
