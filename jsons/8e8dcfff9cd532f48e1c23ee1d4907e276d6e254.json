KnetMiner can digest large volumes 17 of scientific literature and biological research to find and visualise links between the genetic and 18 biological properties of complex traits and diseases. Here we report the main design principles 19 behind KnetMiner and provide use cases for mining public datasets to identify unknown links 20 between traits such grain colour and pre-harvest sprouting in Triticum aestivum, as well as, an 21 evidence-based approach to identify candidate genes under an Arabidopsis thaliana petal size 22 QTL. We have developed KnetMiner knowledge graphs and applications for a range of species 23 including plants, crops and pathogens.

More data 197 and experiments will be needed to address this hypothesis and close the knowledge gap. biologists would generally agree to be informative when studying the function of a gene. Searching 255 a KG for such patterns is akin to searching for relevant sentences containing evidence that 256 supports a particular point of view within a book. Such evidence paths can be short e.g. Gene A 257 was knocked out and phenotype X was observed; or alternatively the evidence path can be longer, 258 e.g. Gene A in species X has an ortholog in species Y, which was shown to regulate the 259 expression of a disease related gene (with a link to the paper). In the first example, the relationship 260 between gene and disease is directly evident and experimentally proven, while in the second 261 12 example the relationship is indirect and less certain but still biologically meaningful. There are 262 many evidence types that should be considered for evaluating the relevance of a gene to a trait. In 263 a KG context, a gene is considered to be, for example, related to 'early flowering' if any of its 264 biologically plausible graph patterns contain nodes related to 'early flowering'. In this context, the 265 word 'related' doesn't necessarily mean that the gene in question will have an effect on 'flowering shown to a user; let alone if combining GCSs for tens to hundreds of genes. There is therefore a 293 need to filter and visualise the subset of information in the GCSs that is most interesting to a 294 specific user. However, the interestingness of information is subjective and will depend on the 295 biological question or the hypothesis that needs to be tested. A scientist with an interest in disease 296 biology is likely to be interested in links to publications, pathways, and annotations related to 297 diseases, while someone studying the biological process of grain filling is likely more interested in 298 links to physiological or anatomical traits. To reduce information overload and visualise the most 299 interesting pieces of information, we have devised two strategies. 1) In the case of a combined 300 gene and keyword search, we use the keywords as a filter to show only paths in the GCS that 301 connect genes with keyword related nodes, i.e. nodes that contain the given keywords in one of 302 their node properties. In the special case where too many publications remain even after keyword 303 filtering, we select the most recent N publications (default N=20). Nodes not matching the keyword 304 are hidden but not removed from the GCS. 2) In the case of a simple gene query (without 305 additional keywords), we initially show all paths between the gene and nodes of type 306 phenotype/trait, i.e. any semantic motif that ends with a trait/phenotype, as this is considered the 307 most important relationship to many KnetMiner users. 308",

Wheat (Triticum aestivum) 129 is the third most-grown cereal crop in the world after maize and rice, and has a hexaploid 15 Gb 130 genome which is 5 times the size of the human genome (The International Wheat Genome 131 Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) et al., 2018). White-grained wheat varieties lack the red 132 compounds (flavonoids) of the seed coat and are milder in flavor. However, white grains are prone 133 to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) which causes the grain to germinate before harvest and results in a 134loss of grain quality.

The subgraph indicates that TT2 in wheat is predicted to regulate the 181 transcriptional activation of MFT. It indicates that MFT has been linked in a recent publication to 182 grain germination and seed dormancy in wheat (Nakamura S, n.d.; Zong Y, n.d.). It also reveals 183 that the MFT ortholog in Arabidopsis is linked to decreased germination rate in the presence of color and other phenotypes, the TT2 network can be expanded with two clicks, to 186 add interacting genes in wheat or model species along with their phenotypic information. For 187 example, the Arabidopsis TT2 ortholog is shown to interact with TTG1 which has links to 188 phenotypes such as lateral root number and root hair length in Arabidopsis (Bahmani R, n.d.; Bipei 189 Zhang, 2017).

GWAS and QTL regions can encompass many seemingly 207 unrelated genes. Candidate gene analysis aims to identify the most likely cause for the phenotypic 208 variation. The identification of candidate genes underlying QTL is not trivial, therefore genetic 209 studies often stop after QTL mapping, or perform a basic search for genes with potentially development(Fletcher, 2001), the authors tested whether ULT1 might be responsible for 216 this QTL. However, the authors stated that among the ecotypes used in the study none showed 217 any polymorphic sites within the ULT1 coding or 2kb upstream region; and the T-DNA insertional 218 mutation of ULT1 showed no significant effect on petal form either. Taken together, the evidence 219 suggested that ULT1 was not responsible for the petal size QTL, and the causal gene remained 220 unidentified as is the case in many other GWAS and QTL studies. Therefore, to explore this 221 further, we analysed an overlapping petal size QTL (manuscript in preparation) using a more 222sophisticated and evidence-based search to see if the authors may have missed something. The 223 biological processes underpinning the size of plant tissues and organs are likely to be related to 224 changes on a cellular level. We therefore used as inputs to KnetMiner the location of a petal size 225 QTL (chromosome 4, 9.92 -10.18 Mb) and the keywords \"cell size\" OR \"cell cycle\" OR \"cell 226 division\". KnetMiner identified 71 genes in the QTL region and ranked them according to their 227 relevance to the keywords (Figure 4A) (see Methods -Gene Ranking)(A) Ranked list of genes shown in the Gene View. The Evidence column summarises the 231 amount of related information within and across species. AT4G18330 is linked to 10 biological 232 processes, 2 cellular components, 33 publications and 1 protein related to \"cell size\" OR \"cell 233 cycle\" OR \"cell division\". All linked publications are from the yeast ortholog. (B) Arabidopsis and a few high-level GO annotations. However, the KnetMiner 239 subgraph for AT4G18330 indicated that the yeast ortholog YER025W (eIF-2-gamma) interacts with 240 cell division cycle proteins such as CDC123 (Figure 4B). Although no knockouts were available for 241 this gene, a polymorphism in the regulatory region was associated with altered cellular and petal 242 phenotypes consistent with a role in petal size (manuscript in preparation). The ability to 243 systematically and visually evaluate different layers of evidence arising from orthologs to 244 interactions, is highly advantageous; it's quick to view and as such, the most relevant genes previously described our tools and methods to build FAIR genome-scale Knowledge 250 Graphs (KG) using the KnetBuilder and rdf2neo data integration platforms (Brandizi et al., 2018a, 251 2018b; Hassani-Pak et al., 2016). Here we elaborate how KnetMiner uses the KG to extract 252 biologically meaningful subgraphs that tell the story of complex traits and diseases. Biologically 253 plausible patterns in the KG are collections of paths through the connected information that most 254",

Our semantic motifs start with a gene node and end with other nodes representing 271 biological entities, ontology terms, publications etc. For example, a path that travels from a Gene 272 node to a GO-term, through an ortholog relation, is biologically plausible (orthologs have often the 273 same function), while travelling through a paralog relation is not (paralogs often adapt new 274 functions). KnetMiner instances can have a bespoke set of semantic motifs reflecting the data 275 model of the KG built for a particular species or domain of interest. We are working towards 276 migrating KnetMiner to support the Cypher graph query language and the Neo4j graph database 277 as a practical and expressive way to define the graph searches that capture the semantic motifs of 278 interest. Supp Table 3 contains example Cypher queries used in the public wheat KnetMiner along 279 with summary statistics for each query. The KnetMiner gene search and subgraph generation are 280 essentially based on these well-defined graph queries. Not every gene will necessarily match all 281 semantic motifs, however, the ones it contains are extracted and their union is taken to produce a 282 gene-centric subgraph (GCS). For example, the wheat KG has over 114,000 GCSs (one for each 283 wheat gene) with sizes of min=1, max=6220 and mean=181 nodes. 284 285 Nodes that are included in a GCS are presumed to be transferable to the gene of interest, in 286 contrast, concepts that are excluded from a GCS (although still part of the KG) are presumed to be 287 irrelevant to the gene in question. Notably, if a semantic motif fails to capture an important 288biological motif, then downstream knowledge mining applications won't be able to exploit this single GCS with hundreds of nodes can be complex and challenging to comprehend when 292",

Therefore at 334 initialisation, KnetMiner pre-processes the KG and builds indices to speed up the SDR weight 335 calculation. The pre-indexing time depends on a number of factors including number of available 336 cores, the KG size, number of genes and number of semantic motifs. With the indices in place, the 337 SDR-weight can be computed in constant time O(1). A KnetMiner search that returns n genes and 338 m evidence nodes, can rank all genes in linear time O(n+m). 339 340 DISCUSSION 341 Biological knowledge discovery is often hampered by the challenges of data integration and new 342 approaches are needed to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and objectivity of the process that knowledge graph built from large scale integration of public and private data sets. 345 It addresses the needs of scientists who generally lack the time and the broad expertise that is 346 necessary to connect, explore, and compare the wealth of genetic, 'omics, and phenotypic 347 information available in the literature and a wide range of related biological databases from key 348 model and non-model species. 349 350 KnetMiner is commonly used by scientists in academia and industry to accelerate gene-trait 351 discovery research. In several biological studies, KnetMiner enabled the identification of hidden 352 relationships between important agronomic traits and potential candidate genes. The presented 353 case studies have shown practical applications of KnetMiner to the understanding of challenging 354 and complex traits in wheat and Arabidopsis. KnetMiner was used in 2014 to investigate traits such 355 as height of biomass willows (Hanley & Karp, 2014) and has more recently become part of a wider 356 roadmap for gene function characterization in crops (Adamski et al., 2020). Public KnetMiner 357 resources (e.g. Arabidopsis, wheat, and rice) give a flavour of the capabilities that are in 358 KnetMiner. While we have so far mostly concentrated on customising KnetMiner for plant sciences 359 and crop improvement, the software we have developed is generic and KGs and KnetMiner can 360 readily be built for other species. Compared to biological discovery platforms available for specific 361 species (Carvalho-Silva et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2017; Mungall et al., 2017), KnetMiner is species-362 agnostic and therefore provides a more cost-effective delivery platform for application to new 363 species. KnetMiner is available as a Docker image from DockerHub and can easily be deployed 364 with a provided sample KG. 365 366 Different KnetMiner views for exploring the search output have been developed; each view has a 367 different aim and helps address different questions. The main design principle was to divide the 368 visualisation into two steps. First, to present the results in formats that are intuitive and familiar to 369",

For example, the KnetMiner REST API is used in Ensembl Plants 383 (Bolser et al., 2017), The Triticeae Toolbox (Blake et al., 2016) and GrainGenes (Blake et al., 384 2019) to link gene sequences to rich gene knowledge graphs. The graph database backend, as 385 well as the FAIR-based data management policies, are another development in which we are 386 investing our efforts, which have the main advantage of allowing us to build a data asset that has 387 the potential to be useful to a wealth of applications, complementary to KnetMiner. The SPARQL 388 and Cypher endpoints have the benefit of providing a layer of access to data that have a more 389 general use than gene-centric knowledge exploration and which, for instance, could be obtained 390 with scripts accessing APIs, workflow tools like Galaxy (Afgan et al., 2018), or data analytics 391 workbenches like Jupyter (Kluyver et al., 2016). This is facilitated by adhering to the well-known 392 good practice of the FAIR principles, which includes the adoption of common data schemas and 393 ontologies (Garcia et al.",

However, after decades of research, it 137 still remains unclear whether there is a potential link between the grain color gene R (Myb) and 138 other phenotypes such as PHS. 139140    We used KnetMiner to search for TRAESCS3D02G468400 -the wheat R gene (the orthologue of 141Arabidopsis TT2) on chromosome 3D, and to explore its knowledge network generated by 142KnetMiner. The TT2 network has a total of 823 connected nodes of 11 different types (see Supp 143Table 1)including wheat specific information sources but also cross-species information from 144 model organisms such as Arabidopsis and rice. Similarly a range of relation types are present in 145 the network including homologies, transcription factor target relations, protein protein interactions, 146 phenotypic observations and correlations from mutant and genetic studies, as well as, curated or 147 auto generated links to ontology terms and publications. 148 Prior to visualising the network, KnetMiner applies a graph filter for interesting subgraphs which 150 uses the keywords that were provided as part of the search (see Methods -Graph 151 Interestingness). In our case, since the TT2 gene search was performed without additional 152 keywords, a default filter is applied which hides all paths but those containing traits and 153 phenotypes. This reduces the network from 823 nodes down to 245 nodes including 101 Trait, 48 154 Phenotype, 72 SNP, 22 Gene and 2 Protein nodes (",
