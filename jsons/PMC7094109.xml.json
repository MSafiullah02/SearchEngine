            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Ebola virus, also referred to as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, spreads from human to human. Non-specific symptoms include fever, sore throat, muscular pain and headaches, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea, and a rash. EVD has an estimated case fatality risk among confirmed cases of 60\u201370% (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014). From December 2013 to March 2016, the largest ever observed Ebola epidemic occurred, with more than 28,616 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 11,310 eventual deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa (World Health Organization (WHO), 2016a, World Health Organization (WHO), 2016b). The major mode of transmission of Ebola virus is direct personal contact with blood, feces, vomit, semen or other bodily fluids. Once patients have recovered, the viral RNA is no longer detectable via ordinary blood testing, but the virus remains detectable in the semen of survivors even 9 months after the onset of illness (Deen et al., 2017). Virological and epidemiological studies demonstrated the substantial potential for sexual transmission of Ebola virus from convalescent survivors, potentially elevating the risk of re-emergence of EVD (Abbate et al., 2016, Mate et al., 2015, Kond\u00e9 et al., 2017).",

The definition suggested waiting for 42 days, which is derived from double the observed maximum incubation period, from the time at which the last Ebola confirmed case tested negative for the second time or the time of burial. In that definition of \u201czero Ebola\u201d, the sexual transmission was not explicitly taken into account as an important factor in sustaining Ebola transmissions. After 42 days, the country was advised to maintain heightened surveillance for 90 days, anticipating recurrent cases (WHO, 2016a). Declaring the end of the epidemic results in downgrading the strengthened health system which involved screening for contact tracing and the maintenance of human resources and laboratory facilities for the immediate testing of blood samples (Elston et al., 2015, Brolin Ribacke et al., 2016). International travel and trade are considerably damaged during an epidemic (Rhymer and Speare, 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016), and thus determining the appropriate time to announce the end of an epidemic has important implications for a country's legal, economic and healthcare sectors.",

In a modeling study that aimed to offer a more objective approach to determining the end of an epidemic, Nishiura and colleagues (Nishiura et al., 2016) derived the probability of observing additional cases at a given time by using the serial interval (i.e., the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in the secondary case) and offspring distribution during the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea. Using the computed probability, authors suggested that the objective determination of the end of a MERS outbreak was attainable if the probability yields less than the threshold value. Despite its successful application in the case of MERS, the extension of this methodology to other diseases including EVD has yet to be conducted.",

Lee and Nishiura (2017) systematically searched the underlying mechanisms of recrudescence, identifying that many recrudescent cases were suspected to have been caused by sexual contact with survivors, implying that accounting for sexual transmission would be essential in making policy decisions on the end of an epidemic. Because sexual transmission was later identified as the cause of recrudescent events, diagnosis of infected individuals has become more challenging than before due to its potential for discrimination (WHO, 2016b). Thus, not only the existence of sexual transmission but also under-ascertainment of convalescent cases are key factors in determining the end of an EVD epidemic.",

The first case in Guinea and Sierra Leone from the Situation Report was reported on 15 September 2014, while the actual first confirmed case was confirmed in March 2014, Guinea and May 2014, Sierra Leone. We had to use the Situation Report, because (i) the alternative datasets, i.e., Patient Database, were subject to revisions even in the present day and (ii) the omitting the very early data in 2014 had only a negligible impact on our calculations. The first case in Liberia was reported earlier than the other two countries on 17 March 2014. We defined Week 0 of the epidemic to be the week starting 15 September 2014. The total number of cases was 2675 in Guinea, 4469 in Liberia and 7118 in Sierra Leone since 15 September 2014, excluding 1580 cases that were reported before 15 September 2014, in Liberia. In addition to epidemic weeks, we also counted weeks since the first \u201cpurported last\u201d case (Table S1).

The largest value 10% may be out of the plausible range, but we examined this value for two reasons: (i) we do not know what would have happened if people were not advised to refrain from sexual transmission during the 2014\u201316 epidemic and (ii) hypothetically we intended to present scenarios in which there were substantial number of sexual transmissions before the end of an epidemic. The parameter p constitutes the serial interval distribution as a weight of the stationary serial interval distribution, and the real time assessment of the proportion of sexual transmissions does not apply to the interpretation of p; see similar debates on the sampling of the generation time (Nishiura, 2010).

Diagnosed cases correspond to the incidence data of confirmed and probable cases (WHO, 2016b). The total number of infected individuals is calculated by (1 + \u03bb) diagnosed cases if the number of undiagnosed cases per a diagnosed case is \u03bb. Then, the total number of ascertained cases was calculated by the sum of diagnosed cases and undiagnosed cases. We examined how influential the imperfect diagnosis would be on the declaration of the end of an epidemic by varying 100 \u00d7 q by setting 50% as the default and varying it from 10% to 90% as part of the sensitivity analysis (Houlihan et al., 2017). To examine the impact of under-ascertainment on the end of an epidemic, we recalculated the total number of cases using q and the observed epidemic curve, estimating the undiagnosed cases as (1\u2212q)/q times the observed epidemic curve. Although the simple use of (1\u2212q)/q could potentially inflate the actual number of cases, and whereas the issue could be overcome by using a latent variable model that separates the observation process from unobservable transmission process, we did not employ the latent modeling, because its explicit incorporation requires us to implement additional formulation that influences the derivation of Eq. (5). In addition, the Eq. (5) requires the reproduction number R\nf as an input, but R\nt varies with time. We examined the impact of using different R\nf estimates on the probability of declaring the end of an outbreak. As the baseline setting, R\nf was calculated by taking its average for the most recent 24 weeks.",

From Week 59, the renewal process was randomly simulated for 20,000 times, using a negative binomially distributed case counts, of which the mean corresponded to the expected number of cases derived from the renewal equation in every week. The effective reproduction number during the waiting period was assumed as known and fixed at 0.05, 0.10 and 0.50, as empirically estimated during the late stage of the epidemic in three West African countries. Second, the probability of observing at least one additional case was calculated. Let A and B represent the time period of waiting time and the time after declaration of the end of epidemic, respectively. The length of waiting time, or the time period of A, denoted by t\nA, was calculated from our proposed method, and the time period, B was simulated for (300- t\nA) additional weeks where 300 is an arbitrary number of the final week of simulations that we consider as sufficiently large. Let X be a random variable of the number of cases in the week t \u2208 {A, B}. Computing Pr(XB>0|XA=0) would allow us to calculate the number of realizations in which the proposed model or the WHO criteria failed to capture the recrudescent event.

To do so, we calculated the cost of waiting for a certain length of time as well as the probability of reduced risk of observing additional cases due to the waiting time. First, let T\nc and T\nw be the number of weeks since the last case, as suggested by our computational method and the WHO, respectively. In many instances, T\nc-T\nw > 0. We extracted the gross domestic product (GDP) due to Ebola epidemic per week, and fixed the cost, c, as 14 million United States dollars (USD) per week (Bambery et al., 2018). Second, let Pr(T\nc) and Pr(T\nw) as the probability of observing at least one additional case given the waiting time T\nc and T\nw. We converted the risk of recrudescence into the number of Ebola deaths by assuming that one epidemic induced 10,000 deaths as approximated by the 2014\u201316 epidemic, and thus, 1% risk of recrudescence is assumed to be equivalent to 100 deaths. To convert the number of deaths into the number of life years lost due to Ebola, we calculated the average age of fatal cases and subtracted the average age from the life expectancy at birth. Table S2 shows the life years lost due to Ebola, y, in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Accordingly, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as(7)ICER=c(Tc\u2212Tw)ay|Pr(Tc)\u2212Pr(Tw)|\u00d7100,where a is the conversion rate from the probability of recrudescence to the number of deaths (i.e., a = 100 deaths per 1% risk of recrudescence). During the implementation, we accounted for the uncertainty with respect to the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases, p. To address the uncertainty, we randomly sampled the value of p for 1000 times from a triangular distribution with the peak 0.0012 and minimum and maximum values at 0 and 1, respectively. This illustration was made with application to Guinea data, but univariate sensitivity analysis using (7) was also conducted for all three countries.",

The resulting ICER is shown in Fig. 5B,D and F for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. As long as 5% threshold was used, the ICER indicated that the proposed method is regarded as cost effective. When 1% threshold was used, and when the number of weeks was counted from the 2nd or later purposed last cases, our analysis indicated that a large cost would be required due to too conservative decision making. Fig. 6\nsummarizes the results from cost-effectiveness analysis. It appeared that 50% of realizations led to declaration from week 55 to 65. The cost required to save one life year was 3000 US Dollars using the threshold 5%, indicating that the use of our modeling method would be regarded as cost effective, according to the standard in industrialized countries. However, compared with a threshold of ICER at 50,000 US Dollars in the United States (Woods et al., 2016), the acceptable total societal cost in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone based on GDP per capita would range from 5929 to 18,929 US Dollars (Bartsch et al., 2015).

From a mathematical modeling point of view, the 42-day rule was not object-oriented, and moreover, did not account for the importance of sexual transmission appropriately. Motivated by a critical need to develop new science-based criteria to assist local communities with deciding when to declare the end of an epidemic, the present study employed a mathematical model (Nishiura 2016) to compute the probability of the endpoint of an epidemic. In addition to comparing the modeling results with those derived from the WHO criteria, we examined how influential relatively unknown parameters are to determining the week in which the end of an epidemic can be declared. While the relevance of sexual transmission to the overall transmission dynamics has been explored elsewhere (Abbate et al., 2016, Vinson et al., 2016), as has the extinction time of Ebola using a mathematical model (Abbate et al., 2016, Valdez et al., 2015), the present study is the first to model the end of Ebola, explicitly accounting for sexual transmission.",

            "text": "Our findings convey two main messages. First, the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases during the convalescent period plays a critical role in determining the risk of recrudescence of Ebola. As a result of the long persistence of the virus in semen among male survivors, we have shown that ascertaining the end of an epidemic may require up to 1 year from the purported last case. This finding should not be taken too negatively. As we have shown even with the long waiting time, refraining from unprotected sexual contact can substantially shorten the waiting time. It is striking that the adherence to refraining from unprotected sex or sexual abstinence is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. In future studies, the importance of sexual transmission should lead to the incorporation of heterogeneous sexual contact patterns into the modeling and decision-making process to allow for precise determination of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, despite the difficulty to statistically estimate the infectiousness during the late stage of infection (Weitz and Dushoff, 2015), an explicit estimate of the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases will be called for. The evidence of additional zoonotic sources was not reported except for a single transmission from the natural reservoir by human-to-human transmission through the genetic surveillance for the sequenced 2014 samples in Sierra Leone (Gire et al., 2014). Thus, the risk of emergence from sexual contact is far greater than the baseline risk of observing Ebola virus disease in humans transmitted from animals, given an epidemic in humans.",

As the number of recent cases increases in a country, so does the time period before declaration of the end of the epidemic. Furthermore, the length of the waiting time can also vary depending on the ascertainment rate, which is seldom observable in real time. We have shown that the 42-day waiting period specified by the WHO is too short for the first declaration and risks unnecessary second, third and fourth declarations due to an unexpected small number of recrudescent cases.",

Through random simulations, the proposed method was tightly validated. However, our study indicated that the computation of objective probability requires a good knowledge of sexual transmission. This finding underscores the need to conduct sexual behavior surveys during and after the Ebola virus disease epidemic (Kond\u00e9 et al., 2017, Soka et al., 2016). In addition to the frequency of sexual contact and the use of condoms, it should be noted that sexual partnership structures can also vary by country and could influence the end of an epidemic. This aspect needs to be explored more in future studies to attain a more precise identification of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases by accounting for all routes of transmission. Using this approach only via a direct transmission, Nishiura and colleagues (Nishiura et al., 2016) have investigated the end of an Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. In many infectious diseases, asymptomatic infection plays a critical role in determining the end of epidemic. For example, Zika virus infection involves 80% of asymptomatic infections (Haby et al., 2018). To objectively determine the end of outbreak, the generation time, i.e. the time from infection in a primary case to infection of the secondary case, or the serial interval needs to be mathematically derived by employing an explicitly structured mathematical model that accounts for all important routes of transmission and asymptomatic infection (Inaba and Nishiura, 2008).",

Second, while our model underscored the need to explore the importance of sexual transmission, we had to discard gender information in the dataset. It may be preferable to obtain summary data detailing gender and age (to identify sexually active people) in the future. Third, implemented control measures were not taken into account. In some cases, if contact was traced, secondary cases may not easily be produced even through the sexual route. Fourth, we did not incorporate the latent case model to separate observation process from unobservable transmission dynamics model. This simplification has introduced two critical issues to our results, i.e., (i) zero observed case did not lead to non-zero actual cases by the simple use of correction factor (1\u2212q)/q, and (ii) potentially inflated numbers were converted to integers. However, the formulation using the latent model would require a different effort of formulation which can even change Eq. (5), and this subject is our ongoing future study.",

Panels B, D and F show the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated as US dollars per life-year in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, respectively, compared to the application of WHO criteria with the fixed 42-day waiting period. In some cases, the time at which our proposed model suggest as the end of Ebola epidemic is earlier than the waiting time adhering to the WHO (i.e. 6 weeks). In such an instance, ICER can take a negative value, and was not calculated (i.e. not calculable).",
