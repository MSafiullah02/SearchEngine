The data were generated during the COVID-19 lockdown in the country through a survey distributed via an online questionnaire, assessing sociodemographic information (7 items), knowledge (5 items), information sources (1 item), risk perception (9 items), expected end of lockdown (1 item), and COVID-19 precautionary health behavior (10 items) , from 28th March to 4th April, 2020, gathering a total of 1,357 responses. A combination of purposive and snowball techniques helped to select the respondents via Whatsapp and Facebook from 180 cities/towns in the 6 geopolitical zones of Nigeria. The survey data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The entire dataset is stored in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet (xlsx) and the questionnaire is attached as a supplementary file. The data will assist in curbing the Coronavirus pandemic by offering evidence for strategic and targeted interventions as well as health policy formulations and implementation.",

Items 1-7 elicit respondents' gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, educational qualification, religion and perceived financial situation. Items 8-12 assessed respondents' COVID-19 knowledge and item 13 their sources of new information about COVID-19. Items 14 -23 and 24 -32 measured their of COVID-19 perceived threat and preventive behavior respectively while item 33 revealed \"how soon they expected things to return to normal.\" Demographic characteristics of respondents are presented in Table 1 . The detailed assessments of responses on COVID-19-related knowledge, information sources, risk perception, expected end of lockdown and precautionary health behavior by residents of Nigeria are depicted in [2] . One item (Section C) assessed sources of new information about COVID-19, and nine items (section D) adapted from [3] measured perceived threat of COVID-19 (Cronbach Alpha is 0.76), while ten items (Section E) adapted from [4, 5] measured preventive behavior (Cronbach Alpha is 0.75) and One item (Section F) asked respondents \"how soon they expected things to return to normal\" The respondents' demographics, COVID-19-related knowledge, knowledge, information sources, risk perception, expected end of lockdown and precautionary health behavior were analyzed using frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Correlation analyses, to understand the relationships between demographics, knowledge, information sources, risk perception, expected end of lockdown and COVID-19precautionary health behavior , were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 20.",
