Three lenses through which one can view the role of narratives in healthcare are discussed. First, organizational narratives help to foster social capital in the organization and, therefore, contribute to the people aspect of the knowledge management initiative in the organization. Second, the recuperative and relationship building roles of illness narratives are described. Third, narratives from the practice of narrative medicine are explored. The chapter concludes by proposing four requirements for narratives to be effective, namely, effective listening skills, the availability of time and place for storytelling, and the codification of narratives.",

On 8 December 1995, he was struck with a massive stroke which damaged his brain stem, leaving him with the \"locked-in syndrome.\" He was paralyzed from head to toe and could only communicate by blinking his left eye. With the help of a speech therapist, who introduced him to an alphabet in which the letters were ordered according to their frequencies in the French language, he dictated the book The Diving-Bell and The Butterfly to Claude Mandibel at Room 119 in the Naval Hospital at Berck-sur-Mer on the coast of the French Channel, where he was warded. In his book, Bauby described his initial hopes that he would very quickly recover his movement and speech. He filled his roving mind \"with a thousand projects: a novel, travel, a play, marketing a fruit cocktail of his own invention,\" projects which he would undertake once he had regained his ability to walk and speak. Alas, as time progressed, he realized that this was not to be. He wrote about the devastation and despair upon discovering that he was a quadriplegic and 130 10. Narratives in Healthcare",

He painfully wrote about the sadness when he thought of the little pleasures in which he participated before the stroke. Bauby's account about his experience of the \"locked-in syndrome\" in his book is an example of a narrative in the context of healthcare [1] .",

Second, there are illness .narratives. These are stories people tell about their subjective experience of illness. Illness narratives have become a major literary genre. They are a source ofknowledge about t.hedisruptive nature of illness and their therapeutic potential has been recognized [9] . It must be clarified at this point that. \"medical sociologists dist.inguish between disease (the diagnostic entity) and illness (the way that disease is perceived, enacted, responded t.o by a person, in relationships with others)\" [10] . Third, there are stories that are told by physicians that practice medicine with narrative competence [11] . Many authors use the term \"narrative\" interchangeably with the term \"story\". In this article, I, too, have adopted this stance. Indeed, Frank [12] has noted that it is more natural to say \"let me tell you a story\" rather than \"let me tell you a narrative.\"",

An exampleof an organizational myth that centers on the founder is the one that David Packard, one of the co-founders of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation, related in his book The HP Way [13] .

One such story had to do with Carlo Urbani, a 46-year-old physician and infectious disease specialist working with the World Health Organization. Dr Urbani was an Italian physician who, at 22, left his hometown of Maiolati Spontini to work in Africa. In 1999, he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of Medicins sans Frontieres, an international humanitarian group dedicated to providing medical care to victims of political violence or natural disasters. In 2003, he was called to the Vietnam-French hospital in Hanoi as an epidemiological expert. It was in Hanoi that he alerted the world to SARS. Without his early warnings of the importance of infection control safeguards and the need for heightened global surveillance of SARS, the outbreak could have been far worse. He started treating Vietnam's only index patient, a Chinese-American businessman who brought the disease into Vietnam after having visited Shanghai and Hong Kong, on February 28. By March 11 he realized he himself had been infected with the disease. He succumbed to SARS in Bangkok on March 29. As a memorial to Dr Urbani, colleagues from around the world have proposed naming the SARS virus after him [16] . This is a story of a fallen hero. Owing to the nature of healthcare, which has much to do with caring, curing, saving, helping, healing, and relieving, it is naturally replete with hero stories.",

These two story types were frequently recounted during the Singapore National Kidney Foundation (NKF) controversy when it was revealed that the NKF Chief Executive Officer (CEO) earned in excess of half a million Singapore dollars a year and flew first class when he traveled at NKF's expense. This flew in the face of the NKF's culture of transparency, accountability, and prudence.

When life is hard, such as the demoralization that one experiences when afflicted with an illness, stories can also provide the narrators some distance from their illness. Stories have a recuperative role and can be used to recuperate persons, relationships, and communities. Stories have a relationship-building role, and listening to a story outside of a relationship is meaningless. Those who tell stories are most concerned about being heard, wondering if they will find others who will answer their call for a relationship [12] . Illness narratives celebrate the subjectivity and uniqueness of the illness experience, which is often objectified and depersonalized by the healthcare system.",

In a sense they are always \"work-in-progress.\" Second, OINs are collaboratively constructed by the voices of many discussants along the way. Third, they are interactive in nature and the readers are not silent; rather, they become active participants in the telling of the story, and they exert their influence on the story in different ways. Therefore, the authorship of an OIN is unclear. Fourth, they are told in real time with a limited time perspective. Last, there is a certain rawness and emotional power in the postings that allow the actual experience to be told closer than through any other genre. Participants of OINs benefit by gaining access to experts in many areas, and because the narrative is multi-authored, they get to see many perspectives on any single issue; but the downside is the lack of a formal mechanism for review of the postings [19] .",

Charon [11] has identified four central narrative situationsin which physicians playa part: physicianand patient, physicianandself,physicianandcolleagues, andphysicianandsociety. Physicianpatient narratives are used to bridge physicianand patient, allowing the physician to join his patient in illness.They are told in words,gestures,and silences. Besides being therapeutic in themselves, these narratives allow the physicianto enter into the world of his patients. Groopman [20] stressed that this melding of minds is important so that a clinical compass can be built. The physician needs to probe not just the patient's body, but also his spirit, to consider not just the patient's physical repair, but also his psychological and emotional repair. This requires open dialogue; this requires the magic of the narrative. Clinical decisions cannot be madealgorithmically, as eachpersonexperiences his illnessdifferently, has very differentrisk profiles, and is willing to give up differentthings to continue living.",

It can be said that Groopman [20] achieves both these narrative types in his book, Second Opinions. In the book, he reflects on the complexity of medical decision making. At the same time, he has a conversation with society about reality in the world of medicine, a world many wish to be perfect, but which is far from being so: a world where even the best physicians sometimes give bad advice and make serious mistakes.",

Nichols and Stevens [21] listed six bad listening habits uncoveredby research at the Universityof Minnesota. They found these habits to be almost universal, and used as a rationalization for not listening, even when the listener knows and admits he should be listening. First, the habit of faking attention. Listeners who fake attention deceive themselves and frequently get caught. Second, the habit of \"I-get-the-facts\" listening. These listeners miss the point of listening, which is rarely \"to get the facts,\" but rather \"to understand the idea,\" \"to grasp the meaning and significance,\"or \"to look with me rather than at me.\" Third, the habit of avoiding difficult listening.

Here, the listener equates \"interesting\" to \"valuable.\" What is required is a change of attitude to views of even the most ordinary person as one who has some ideas to offer and from whom I want to take for myself those ideas of his. Fifth, the habit of criticizing delivery and physical appearance. This habit causes the listener to focus on the physical aspects (i.e, the clothes, accessories, or hairstyle worn by the speaker) or the speech (i.e, the foreign accent or \"twang\"). Instead of listening intently to the content, the listener gets distracted by mentally criticizing the physical appearance or delivery of the content, adopting an attitude that \"a person who talks like that cannot have anything worth listening to.\" Last, the habit of yielding easily to distractions that compete with the person talking refers to a lack of willingness to proactively shut out the distractions that inevitably interrupt many narratives, e.g. by closing the door, moving closer to the person talking, or mentally shutting out the distractions when all other measures prove futile. These habits have a serious consequence. They cause the listener, and in the case of healthcare, the physician, to lose the opportunity to learn something from what is being said by the patient.",

The elements of empathy and whole-heartedness are represented in the radicals\" -{/' (Yi1 Xin1, meaning with one heart). Some narratives,e.g. pain narratives, are more difficult to understand and, therefore, will require more effort on the part of the listener. They are especially difficult to understand because of their lack of coherence and structure, and because they are typically poured out in a haphazard way. In order to understand the narrative, physicians not only need to listen to the exact words used and the order in which they were uttered, but also match these with the body language involved. The importance of time and place is evident. As Heath [18] so clearly puts it, \"Stories can only be told if people have time to talk and time to listen and to hear. The richerthe narrative,the more time is needed.\"The timeelementof narrativewas also highlighted by Bayliss [22] . He stressed that both physicians and patients need time for narratives: the physician needs time to listen, and the patients to deliver. He bemoaned the current situation where physicians are required to see more patients in less time, stating that it is not in the best interest of either party to do this, as it lessens the intellectual satisfaction of understanding narratives. A lack of time and opportunity has been frequently cited as being a barrier to knowledge sharing [23] , which is most effectively achieved through \"a convincing narrative delivered with elegance and passion\" [24] . A frequent intrusion to narrative episodes is that created by technology. Telephones, facsimile machines, and portable digital assistants have invaded the workplace, disrupting many narrative episodes with patients. It may be useful (or even necessary) for healthcare organizations to consider providing \"Zen gardens,\" or places of peace. These are \"islands of non-technology\" where people can concentrate, think, read, write, or have a conversation uninterrupted by technology [25] .",

Nursing presence has to do with \"mutual openness with the other, entering the world of the other to see the objective from his or her standpoint, and coexisting for some moments in time and space\", and is an intersubjective encounter between a nurse and a patient in which the nurse encounters the patient as a unique human being in a unique situation and chooses to spend her/himself on the patient's behalf.

In the second layer, clinical presence, narratives are used to understand the patient's perspective in order to go beyond the scientific data. The last layer, healing presence, uses narratives to achieve attunement with each other. Here, the ability to relate closely to another person, to empathize, will enable a person to know what will work and when to act for a patient.

This is being done with the Databaseof Individual Patient Experience(DIPEx; http://www.dipex.org/), a sitelaunched in July 2001 by Ann McPherson and AndrewHerxheimerafter their own experiences of illness (breast cancer and knee replacement surgery respectively). They decided to start this patient experience Website (hypertension and prostatecancer were the firsttwo topics)after failingto findothers to talk to about their illnesses. Currently, DIPEx is aimed at patients, their caregivers, family, and friends, and also functions as a teaching resource for health professionals. The Website contains interviews with everyday people about their own experiences of serious illnesses,health problems,or health-related matters. Their aim is to cover 100main illnessesand conditions, as well as areas such as immunization, rare diseases, skin conditions, infertility, and chronic illnesses. The limitation is that the databasecurrentlyrepresents the experiences and views of people withinthe UK. A Website with a similar charter, but on an international scale, is badly needed, as the experienceof illness is likely to be,influenced by culture. Perhaps the most appropriate organization to championthis effort is the World HealthOrganization.",
