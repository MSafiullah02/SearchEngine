            "text": "Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment of patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, an adverse consequence of this intervention is the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which results in considerable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients (American Thoracic Society; Infectious Diseases Society of America 2005; Fujitani et al. 2011). VAP is defined as the development of pneumonia within 48\u201372 h after endotracheal intubation. Although the incidence of VAP is decreasing, still 9\u201327% of ventilated patients will develop this complication, with the highest incidence occurring in the first 10 days after intubation. Endotracheal intubation increases the risk of developing health care associated pneumonia by 6\u201320-fold. As compared to health care associated pneumonia (HAP) in non-intubated patients, both actual and attributable mortality is higher in VAP. Patients with certain underlying lung diseases, such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Richardson et al. 1982), have a particularly high incidence of VAP (Richardson et al. 1982). Conversely, VAP represents a major risk factor for the development of ALI and ARDS.",

            "text": "VAP can be caused by an array of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, and may be polymicrobial in up to a third of cases (American Thoracic Society; Infectious Diseases Society of America 2005; Fujitani et al. 2011). The most common cause of VAP is by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, with methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) representing over 60% of the S. aureus isolates in VAP. Other VAP-causing pathogens include aerobic Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltiphila. Legionella pneumophila is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that is an etiologic agent in both community acquired pneumonia (CAP), HAP and VAP. Viruses and fungi are unusual causes of VAP, although these organisms can modulate innate mucosal responses predisposing to the development of VAP. While the bacterial pathogens that cause VAP are similar to those that cause HAP in non-intubated patients, VAP is more frequently caused by pathogens with intrinsic resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, S. maltiphila, and MRSA. Mortality is considerably higher in patients with VAP due to P. aeruginosa strains that express the type III secretion system required for the secretion of pseudomonal exotoxins S, T, U, and Y (Roy-Burman et al. 2001; Sadikot et al. 2005). A recent and disturbing trend is the increasing prevalence of community acquired stains of MRSA (CA-MRSA) as a cause of nosocomial infections, including VAP(Kashuk et al. 2010). CA-MRSA, which is typically the USA300 strain, produce an array of exotoxins that promote extensive tissue necrosis and cavity formation. The intrinsic antibiotic resistance of these Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains contributes to increased mortality in patients with VAP (Fujitani et al. 2011). However, these pathogens are generally less virulent and invasive than pathogens that cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals in the community, and tend to be invasive in hosts with anatomic defects in the respiratory tract or substantial impairment in lung mucosal innate immunity. Therefore, the presence of these bacterial species as pathogens identifies patients with profound anatomic defects or defects in lung innate immunity.",

            "text": "The vast majority of VAP cases develop as a result of microaspiration of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx (American Thoracic Society; Infectious Diseases Society of America 2005). Oropharyngeal colonization occurs very rapidly in critically ill patients. For example, nearly 75% of patients with underlying lung disease and/or undergoing oropharyngeal intubation were found to be colonized by pathogenic bacteria within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit (Garrouste-Orgeas et al. 1997). Reservoirs contributing to oropharyngeal colonization include the nasopharynx, sinuses, and stomach. Endotracheal tubes contribute to colonization by directly injuring mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, which facilitates bacterial adhesion. Organisms that cause VAP, including P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, promote biofilm formation with the endotracheal tube lumen, which can function as a nidus for direct inoculation of infected material into the distal airspaces. Less common sources of bacterial inoculation include colonization of the ventilator circuit or direct inoculation via infected aerosols or instrumentation, particularly suction catheters or \u00adbronchoscopes. By comparison, hematogenous seeding of the lung as a cause of VAP is considerably less common, accounting for <15% of cases. Notable exceptions are hematogenous seeding from an intravascular S. aureus infection or gut bacterial translocation that can occur in immunocompromised patients with neutropenia.",

Damage to ciliated cells can occur as a direct result of endotracheal \u00adintubation or conditions that predispose the patient to respiratory failure (Nicholls et al. 2003; Piatti et al. 2005; Pittet et al. 2010). As discussed previously, denuding of columnar epithelial cells can result from the endotracheal tube or endotracheal tube cuff. Moreover, lung conditions that can result in mechanical ventilation, such as COPD, are associated with impaired mucocilliary transport (Piatti et al. 2005). Moreover, certain forms of infectious lung injury, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is characterized by bronchial epithelial denudation and loss of cilia (Nicholls et al. 2003). Similarly, influenza infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infection, which is due not only to impairment in lung innate responses, but also disruption of mucocilliary transport mechanisms (Pittet et al. 2010).",

This syndrome of immune suppression has been best characterized and is perhaps most severe in sepsis, but has also been described in trauma patients, burn injury patients, and patients during the peri-operative period. Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from the interaction between microbe and host. Clinically, it is defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with evidence of infection (Members of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine 2003). Changes in the population at risk for the development of sepsis, including an increase in the number of elderly and immunocompromised patients, has resulted in a steady rise in the incidence of severe sepsis (Martin et al. 2003). Despite improvements in supportive care and immunomodulatory therapies, the mortality rate from severe sepsis remains unacceptably high (Brun-Buisson 2000).",

            "text": "Host immune responses in critical illness, including sepsis can be conceptualized as occurring in distinct but overlapping phases. The initial response during critical illness, referred to as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), is characterized by the release of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators, including early responses cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin 12 (IL-12) leukocyte-active chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory leukotrienes (Dinarello 2000). SIRS is \u00adcounter-regulated by the release of inhibitory molecules, including anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2)), suppressors of pathogen recognition signaling cascades, immunomodulatory prostanoids and hormones. This counter-regulatory phase is referred to as the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) (Wesche et al. 1999; Bone 1996). Molecules released during CARS are believed to serve as a functional \u201cbrake\u201d on systemic inflammation, and the expression of these mediators is induced by both microbial-derived and host-derived signals. SIRS and CARS overlap considerably, hence the overall immune status of the patient is dependent on which response \u00adpredominates (Fig. 8.2) (van der Poll and van Deventer 1999). Recent evidence \u00adsuggests a third response to an inflammatory insult, referred to as the mixed antagonist response \u00adsyndrome (MARS). This response is characterized by the secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (specifically IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, granulocyte-\u00admacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-10) (Tamayo et al. 2011). Consistent with this mixed systemic cytokine response, elevated levels of IL-6 in circulation has been shown to predict the development of VAP (Ramirez et al. 2009). Whether the initial SIRS response drives the expression of molecules that contribute to immune suppression or simply a marker of systemic inflammation remains to be determined. A summary of innate immune events in critical illness is shown in Fig. 8.2.\n",

            "text": "The compensatory release of anti-inflammatory molecules in sepsis is believed to mediate immunosuppression during the peri-septic or post-injury period, during which time immune cell function is substantially impaired (historically referred to as critical illness-induced leukocyte \u201cdeactivation\u201d or \u201cimmunoparalysis\u201d). Recently, since the altered leukocyte phenotype in critical illness involves selective regulation of some, but not all innate genes, this phenomenon is now more appropriated referred to as reprogramming. Leukocyte reprogramming appears to be of \u00adconsiderable clinical significance, as higher rates of nosocomial infection and increased mortality are observed in postoperative, burn injury or septic patients who display evidence of monocyte deactivation, either in the form of decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression, ex vivo cytokine production or impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (Appel et al. 1989; Munoz et al. 1991). Septic patients are especially susceptible to nosocomial infections of the lung, particularly pneumonia from multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (Richardson et al. 1982; Mustard et al. 1991). Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is particularly prominent in patients with preexisting deficiencies in innate and acquired immunity, including the elderly and patients with chronic medical conditions (Hotchkiss and Karl 2003).",

            "text": "While sepsis and similar stress-associated events have been shown to influence the effector activity of a variety of immune cells, the majority of studies have focused on peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), and to a lesser extent tissue macrophages. Changes in monocyte/macrophage function in sepsis resemble but are not identical to those observed in endotoxin-tolerized macrophages. Endotoxin tolerance describes the phenomena whereby upon initial exposure to LPS, cells become refractory to a secondary stimulus with LPS. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) other than LPS can also induce a tolerance phenotype, and PAMPs of one type can induce cross tolerance to a different PAMP. Induction of tolerance results in suppression of multiple inflammatory genes, including both NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent genes (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS). Tolerance does not cause global suppression of all genes, as genes encoding certain antimicrobial and phagocytic proteins, including cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, lipocalin, the scavenger receptor MARCO and the fMLP receptor, are indeed super-induced in response to sequential exposure to LPS (Foster et al. 2007). It is also noteworthy that the induction of this phenotype is not restricted to myeloid cells, as structural cells, including alveolar epithelial cells, have been shown to develop a tolerance response upon repeated exposure to PAMPs. The LPS or PAMP tolerized phenotype is transient in nature and entirely reversible, and has been associated with remodeling of chromatin in the promoter region of several tolerizable genes (Foster et al. 2007; Chan et al. 2005).",

Most notably, a significant reduction in the ex vivo production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 has been observed in monocytes isolated from patients with sepsis (Munoz et al. 1991). This change in cytokine production may be a predictor of outcome, as peripheral monocytes isolated from those who survived sepsis regained their ability to produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and monocytes isolated from the nonsurvivors did not (Munoz et al. 1991). Conversely, the \u00adproduction of certain anti-inflammatory proteins, including IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and the TNF soluble receptor I and II are enhanced in monocytes isolated from sepsis patients or patients with ventilator-induced lung injury (Frank et al. 2006). Patients with sepsis or early trauma have reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression (Appel et al. 1989; Adib-Conquy et al. 2006). This reduction in HLA-DR expression has been reported to directly correlate with the magnitude of sepsis (Volk et al. 2000) and may partially contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity observed in patients with critical illness.",

In particular, alveolar macrophage function has been shown to be impaired in the setting of sepsis. For example, alveolar macrophages recovered from mice with abdominal sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture) display reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, nitric oxide, and respiratory burst (Reddy et al. 2001; Goya et al. 1992). Importantly, these phenotypic alterations in alveolar macrophage effector function are associated with a markedly enhanced susceptibility to intrapulmonary challenge with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens (Steinhauser et al. 1999; Deng et al. 2006). Little is known about alveolar macrophage phenotype in critically ill patients at risk for the development of VAP. However, we have performed Affymetrix microarray analysis on adherence purified alveolar macrophages recovered from patients with sepsis-induced ALI within 3 days of onset of sepsis. Relative to alveolar macrophages recovered from healthy subjects, lung macrophages from sepsis-induced ALI patients displayed a hybrid tolerized/alternatively activated phenotype, as characterized by minimal change or suppression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS), induction of antimicrobial genes (antimicrobial peptides, chemoattractant, and phagocytosis genes), and expression of makers of alternative (M2) rather than classical (M1) activation (high arginase, CCR2, IL-4R\u03b1, MMP expression; low iNOS, interferon-\u03b3, and IFN-inducible chemokine expression) (Gordon and Martinez 2010). Although this expression pattern may partially reflect the lung injury response, it is likely that the phenotype is shaped by systemic inflammation.",

Directed migration is also impaired by nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of ICAM and VCAM-dependent adhesion and transmigration of PMN, downregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, and inhibition of G-protein coupled receptor signaling (Benjamim et al. 2000; Cummings et al. 1999; Czermak et al. 1999; Huber-Lang et al. 2001; Swartz et al. 2000).

NETs are complex structures composed of nuclear chromatin, histones, a variety of granular antimicrobial proteins and some cytoplasmic proteins (Urban et al. 2009). Formation occurs in response to exposure of neutrophils to plasma from septic patients (Clark et al. 2007) as well as direct contact with microbial pathogens (Remijsen et al. 2011). Neutrophil elastase is released from azurophilic granules, assisting in the formation of NETs via decondensation of nuclear chromatin, which along with other serine proteases confer antimicrobial responses (Papayannopoulos et al. 2010). NET-associated myeloperoxidase directly contributes to bacterial killing of Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of H2O2 (Parker et al. 2012). NETs are capable of physically ensnaring bacteria and facilitating the interactions between bacteria and antimicrobial effectors, ultimately leading to enhanced bacterial killing (Mantovani et al. 2011). Despite their broad antimicrobial capacity, some bacteria express nucleases to degrade NETs, thus avoiding capture and bacterial cell death (Buchanan et al. 2006; Berends et al. 2010; Young et al. 2011). In some cases, NETs may exert detrimental effects to the host. Increasing evidence links NET formation to excessive inflammation and tissue damage in diseases such as sepsis (Clark et al. 2007). NET formation has recently been demonstrated in the alveoli of mice with influenza H1N1 pneumonia, and these structures contribute to acute lung injury responses in these animals (Narasaraju et al. 2011). While the presence of NETs has not been clearly established in experimental bacterial pneumonia or in patients with VAP, it is tempting to speculate that these structures may contribute to lung injury that can occur in this setting.",

DC are prevalent centrally within the spleen, lymphatics, and at mucosal surfaces, most notably in gut and respiratory tract. Systemic endotoxin administration in mice results in a brisk depletion in splenic DC by 24 h post-LPS. Similarly, there is a prolonged loss of DC out to 15 days post-induction of abdominal sepsis in both lung and spleen (Wen et al. 2008). In humans with lethal sepsis, follicular DC are substantially diminished early in the course of disease (Hotchkiss et al. 2002). Similarly, reductions in blood myeloid DC and plasmacytoid DC (27 and 53% of controls, respectively) have been observed in patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, and numbers of DC inversely correlated with procalcitonin levels, a marker of systemic inflammation (Dreschler et al. 2012). Endotoxin-tolerized DC or DC isolated from animals or humans with sepsis produce low levels of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1, but high levels of IL-10 (Wen et al. 2008; Wysocka et al. 2001). This shift in cytokine profiles can persist for up to 6 weeks post-abdominal sepsis (CLP), and has been associated with posttranslational epigenetic modifications of histones binding to the IL-12 p35 and p40 promoters and increased susceptibility to pulmonary fungal challenge (Wen et al. 2008). Regulatory DC, or \u201ctolerogenic\u201d DC, are a newly described DC population that can be induced by incubation of bone marrow-derived DC with IL-10, resulting in DC that preferentially secrete IL-10 rather than IL-12, and induce T cell tolerance. A naturally occurring DCreg population has been identified in spleen (CD11clow, CD45RBhigh), and adoptive transfer of this cell population to septic mice diminished inflammatory cytokine production and sepsis-induced lethality (Fujita et al. 2006). Changes in the number, distribution, and function of these cells in lung, especially during critical illness, have not yet been explored.",

For instance, the memory/effector CD8+/CD45RO+ T lymphocyte subset in nonsurviving septic patients demonstrate significantly decreased IFN-\u03b3 synthesis compared with survivors (Zedler et al. 1999). Similarly, T cell proliferative responses and cytokine production (IL-2, TNF-\u03b1) were significantly depressed in patients with abdominal sepsis, as compared to healthy controls, and the degree of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 suppression directly correlated with patient survival (Heidecke et al. 1999). The proportion of Th2 T cells is increased in patients with sepsis, but not in non-septic critically ill control patients and healthy subjects (Ferguson et al. 1999). Similar observations have been made in animal models of sepsis. Splenocytes isolated from mice undergoing CLP produced less IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3, and more IL-4 and IL-10 than splenocytes isolated from healthy animals (Ayala et al. 1994; O\u2019Sullivan et al. 1995). Given the importance of Th1 phenotype responses in host defense against both intracellular and extracellular microbial pathogens, this shift away from an appropriate Th1- and towards a dysregulated Th2-phenotype response has obvious implications for antimicrobial host immunity.",

Suppressive effects of Treg are mediated by both direct cell\u2013cell contact and through the release of soluble mediators, including but not limited to TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10. An increase in the percentage (but not absolute number) of Treg has been found in blood, lymphatics, or spleen in septic mice and humans with sepsis or trauma (Venet et al. 2008; Scumpia et al. 2006; Wisnoski et al. 2007). Moreover, there is evidence of enhanced Foxp3 expression and suppressive function of Treg in mice with abdominal sepsis, and adoptive transfer of Treg into septic mice reduced overzealous TNF-\u03b1 production and improved mortality. However, the depletion of CD4+ CD25+ Treg in mice with polymicrobial sepsis had little impact on sepsis-induced mortality (Scumpia et al. 2006; Wisnoski et al. 2007). Thus, the role of Treg in controlling the systemic inflammatory response, or as a mediator of impaired innate and acquired immunity in critically ill patients at risk for VAP, is uncertain and requires further study.",

Toll-like receptors are a family of evolutionarily conserved type I transmembrane receptors that respond to PAMPs expressed by a diverse group of infectious microorganisms, resulting in activation of the host\u2019s immune system (Aderem and Ulevitch 2000; Akira and Hemmi 2003). There exist 13 distinct TLRs (10 in humans and 13 in mice) that have in common an extracellular domain with leucine rich repeats and an intracytoplasmic domain shared with the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). Binding of ligands to TLRs initiates a signaling cascade involving myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD88), IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAK 1 and 4), and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in NF-\u03baB translocation and MAPK activation, culminating in expression of genes involved in antimicrobial host defense (Aderem and Ulevitch 2000; Akira and Hemmi 2003). In addition, certain TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 can initiated a MyD88-independent signaling cascade that requires the adaptor proteins Toll-IL-1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), resulting in the expression of interferon responsive genes. The most relevant TLRs in lung antibacterial host defense include TLR2, which recognizes specific components of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi; TLR4, which is the major receptor for LPS; TLR5, which recognizes and is activated by bacterial flagellin; and TLR9, which is activated by unmethylated CpG motifs present in microbial but not mammalian DNA. In addition to PAMPs, TLRs can be activated by host-derived danger signals, referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, and include heat shock proteins and matrix components (Ohashi et al. 2000). Also, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a molecule released during the septic response that has recently been shown to activate TLR2 and TLR4 (Park et al. 2004). This is of particular relevance in the setting of sepsis and acute lung injury.",

For example, TLR4 recognizes the lipid A moiety of LPS, and is the major TLR mediating early innate responses and clearance of non-flagellated Gram-negative organisms that cause VAP, including K. pneumoniae, H. influenza, and E. coli (Schurr et al. 2005; Bhan et al. 2010; Wieland et al. 2005). In addition, mice deficient in TLR9 display impaired dendritic cell-mediated responses during experimental Klebsiella or Legionella pneumonia, culminating in reduced lung bacterial clearance and decreased survival (Bhan et al. 2007, 2008). Innate responses to the flagellated extracellular bacteria P. aeruginosa are mediated by several MyD88-dependent TLRs, predominantly TLR4 and TLR5 (Hajjar et al. 2005; Ramphal et al. 2008; Skerrett et al. 2004). Interestingly, both bone marrow-derived and stromal cells contribute to MyD88-dependent innate responses to P. aeruginosa in the lung (Hajjar et al. 2005).",

For example, while TLR2 has been shown to mediate inflammatory responses to the staphylococcal toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin, neither TLR2, TLR4, nor MyD88 is required for effective anti-staphylococcal host immunity during respiratory infection (Skerrett et al. 2004; Zivkovic et al. 2011). The nucleotide-binding oligodimerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLR) NOD1 and NOD2, which recognize the peptidoglycan component muramyl dipeptide (MDP), have been shown to be important in inflammatory cytokine release and bacterial eradication in a murine S. aureus skin infection model(Hruz et al. 2009; Inohara et al. 2005). More recently, mice deficient in RIP2, the shared NOD1/2 adaptor molecule, are considerably more susceptible to intrapulmonary challenge with S. aureus than wild-type mice, an effect which is dependent on downstream activation of inflammasome-caspase-1-dependent IL-1\u03b2 release (unpublished observations, J. Deng). These later observations suggest that NLRs, rather than TLRs, may be the predominant \u00adcontributors to anti-staphylococcal immunity in the lung",

In particular, either enhanced or reduced cell surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4 have been described in monocytes from sepsis patients and in tissue macrophages during experimental sepsis (Deng et al. 2006; Brunialti et al. 2006). Moreover, changes in monocyte cell surface expression of LPS binding partners MD2, CD14, and CD71 have also been observed in sepsis (Brunialti et al. 2006; Wolfs et al. 2008; Williams et al. 1998). Disparate findings are likely attributable to temporal differences in assessment of TLR expression and the heterogeneity of patient populations studied and animal models employed. The extracellular domains of certain TLRs can be shed from activated macrophages, and serve as sinks to bind extracellular PAMPs, and as a consequence dampen TLR-mediated signal transduction. For instance, soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) is released by human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and diminishes the cellular response to the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys without affecting cellular responses to LPS (LeBouder et al. 2003). Both naturally occurring and recombinant soluble TLR4 have been shown to diminish responses to LPS (Iwami et al. 2000; Hyakushima et al. 2004). The contribution of soluble TLR2 and TLR4 to impaired innate responses during critical illness remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Molecules have been identified that inhibit TLR signaling at multiple sites downstream of the receptor. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and -4 are key kinases necessary for both MyD88-dependent and IL-1 receptor-mediated \u00adsignal transduction. Consequently, interruption of IRAK-1 and -4 phosphorylation or trafficking can have profound effects on the downstream expression of both NF-\u03baB and MAPK-dependent inflammatory or antimicrobial genes. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M (IRAK-M), also named IRAK-3, is a member of the IRAK family. However, IRAK-M differs from IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 in that this protein lacks kinase activity and IRAK-M has been shown to be a negative regulator of TLR signaling by blocking the disassociation of IRAK-1 from the Toll-IL-1 signaling domain. Bone marrow-derived or lung macrophages lacking IRAK-M display enhanced MAPK kinase activation and inflammatory cytokine production in response to TLR agonists and live bacteria (Wesche et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2002). Importantly, IRAK-M is induced by endotoxin, the NOD-2 ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP), and other PAMPs and is required for the development of tolerance to endotoxin and peptidoglycan (Kobayashi et al. 2002; Hedl et al. 2007; Nakayama et al. 2004). We have found that IRAK-M is upregulated in alveolar macrophages during experimental sepsis in a MyD88-dependent fashion, and mediates both the suppression of macrophage cytokine responses and impaired lung clearance of P. aeruginosa in septic mice (Deng et al. 2006; Lyn-Kew et al. 2010). IRAK-M has also been shown to suppress TLR-mediated responses in murine primary alveolar epithelial cells (Seki et al. 2010). Emerging data suggests that IRAK-M may be a major mediator and perhaps a biomarker for severity of disease in sepsis. IRAK-M is substantially induced in monocytes from healthy subjects administered LPS intravenously (van\u2019t Veer et al. 2007). In patients with Gram-negative sepsis, blood monocytes demonstrate a more rapid and robust expression of IRAK-M when stimulated ex vivo with LPS (Escoll et al. 2003). Additionally, enhanced expression of IRAK-M mRNA has been noted in pediatric patients with sepsis, and high IRAK-M mRNA levels were associated with longer length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, need for mechanical ventilation and death (Hall et al. 2007). We have also observed high constitutive expression of IRAK-M mRNA in alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood buffy coat cells isolated from patients with sepsis-induced ALI, as compared to similar cell populations from healthy subjects (T. Standiford, unpublished observations). In fact, IRAK-M was the only negative regulator of TLR signaling found to be significantly induced in this patient population.",

However, the extracellular domain of this molecule inhibits Toll-IL-1 signaling by interfering with binding of ligands to TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, and IL-1 receptor I, whereas the intracellular domain interferes with the complexing of IRAK-1 with TRAF-6 (Thomassen et al. 1999; Wald et al. 2003; Qin et al. 2005). SIGIRR is expressed predominantly by epithelial cells, including alveolar epithelial cells, but also to a lesser degree in monocytic populations. Mice deficient in SIGIRR have enhanced inflammatory responses to LPS challenge. Moreover, SIGIRR is upregulated in the PBM of septic patients, and is associated with the development of endotoxin tolerance in these cells (Adib-Conquy et al. 2006). MyD88 short (MyD88s) is an alternatively spliced variant of the parent molecule, MyD88. MyD88s functions as a dominant negative molecule by blocking recruitment of IRAK-4 to the toll-IL-1 signaling domain, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of IRAK-1 (Burns et al. 2003; Rao et al. 2005). The expression of MyD88s is induced in monocytes in response to LPS and is constitutively expressed in blood monocytes isolated from patients with sepsis (Adib-Conquy et al. 2006). Tollip disrupts IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 interactions, whereas microRNA 146 (miRNA 146) post-transcriptionally inhibits IRAK-1 and TRAF6 expression (Nahid et al. 2011). The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are a family of molecules that predominately inhibit JAK-Stat signaling, but also disrupt TLR signaling cascades through a yet undefined mechanism. While these latter molecules could contribute to suppression of TLR-mediated responses during critical illness, there is no data to show enhanced expression and/or activity in blood monocytes or lung macrophages in patients at risk for the development of VAP.",

            "text": "Initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV) is a vital therapeutic intervention in patients with respiratory failure. A consequence of mechanical ventilation is the inhomogeneous distribution of pressure and volumes to various regions of lung, resulting in excessive stretch in some alveolar units (referred to as volutrauma), and repeated alveolar collapse in other regions (referred to as atelectotrauma) (Pugin et al. 1998). Excessive lung stretch results in activation of several transcriptional pathways, including the NF-kB and the MAPK kinase pathway (Fos, Jun), which contributes to the release of various inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 (Gharib et al. 2009; Halbertsma et al. 2005; Jaecklin et al. 2011). These cellular mediators not only trigger deleterious lung injury responses and possibly multiple organ dysfunction (An et al. 2011), but may also promote the reprogramming of leukocytes and structural cells that occurs in critical illness. Importantly, MV at moderate to high lung volumes can also prime the lung for enhanced lung injury or systemic organ failure in response to an infectious challenge (e.g., second hit). For instance, as compared to spontaneously breathing animals, the intrapulmonary administration of S. aureus or E. coli to mechanically ventilated mice results in enhanced lung inflammation and lung injury, without changes in lung bacterial clearance (Dhanireddy et al. 2006). Likewise, the i.p. administration of LPS to mice undergoing high tidal volume MV substantially increased lung and systemic cytokine expression and extrapulmonary organ injury, as compared to non-mechanically ventilated controls (O\u2019Mahony et al. 2006). Mechanisms accounting for synergistic interactions between lung stretch and infectious challenge have not been clearly defined. However, previous work has shown that stretch of human alveolar epithelial cells increases the expression of TLR2 by sixfold (Charles et al. 2011). Moreover, mechanical ventilation increased the relative expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in lung tissue and increased the generation of endogenous ligands for TLR4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Vaneker et al. 2008). Recent work has shown that mechanical ventilation also generates other TLR4-independent and MyD88-dependant endogenous TLR ligands (Chun et al. 2010). Hyperinflation of the lung with high tidal volume not only promotes a significant increase in the expression of TLR4, but also paradoxically induces the expression of IRAK-M, an important negative regulator of TLR signaling (Villar et al. 2010).",

Alveolar collapse is due, in part, to reductions in surfactant that occur in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and in patients with VAP (Nakos et al. 2003). Atelectasis has been shown to promote bacterial overgrowth, and use of open ventilation strategies and administration of exogenous surfactant can reduce bacterial numbers in an animal model of VAP (van Kaam et al. 2004). Moreover, administration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5\u20138 cmH2O to non-hypoxemic mechanically ventilated patients can reduce the incidence of VAP (Manzano et al. 2008). Surfactant proteins A and D can agglutinate P. aeruginosa, and SP-D can serve as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa (McCormack 2006). Pseudomonal elastase has been shown to degrade SP-A and SP-D, and these proteins are decreased in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (Mariencheck et al. 2003). However, changes in SP-A and SP-D levels during mechanical ventilation and/or VAP have not been well characterized.",

            "text": "Administration of high concentrations of oxygen (FIO2 >50%) used during transient or prolonged mechanical ventilation is a common treatment for patients with respiratory failure (Gore et al. 2010). Although therapeutically necessary, hyperoxia results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote the breakdown of critical barriers leading to systemic cellular and organ injury (Lee and Choi 2003). In the lung, ROS cause severe cellular damage and death, exposure of the basement membrane and disruption of the alveolar capillary membrane leading to increased pulmonary permeability, influx of inflammatory cells, and impaired gas exchange (Bhandari and Elias 2006). Hyperoxic exposure can also exacerbate alveolar epithelial injury and apoptosis in response to infectious challenge with P. \u00adaeruginosa or L. pneumophila, resulting in increased bacterial dissemination (Kikuchi et al. 2009). Moreover, high oxygen tensions inhibit the function of innate immune cells. For instance, macrophages exposed to elevated concentration of oxygen both in vitro and in vivo display reduced phagocytosis and killing of Gram-negative bacteria which correlated with changes in cell morphology and actin polymerization (O\u2019Reilly et al. 2003). In addition, in vivo hyperoxia exposure increased the susceptibility to K. pneumoniae lung infections, an effect that was partially attributed to reduced BAL GM-CSF levels and cell surface expression of TLR4 by AM (Baleeiro et al. 2003). Importantly, systemic treatment of these mice with GM-CSF during hyperoxia preserved macrophage functionality and decreased the severity of lung infection (Baleeiro et al. 2006). Taken together, hyperoxia is detrimental to the host by promoting greater alveolarcapillary injury, impairing local antibacterial responses, and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination.",

Candida species is among the most common organisms recovered from endotracheal tube biofilm and tracheal secretions in patients with VAP (Adair et al. 1999). Historically, Candida has been considered a commensal organisms rather than a true pathogen, and therefore believed to play no role in VAP disease pathogenesis. However, an observational study found a statistical association between airway colonization with Candida species and the development of P. aeruginosa VAP (Azoulay et al. 2006). In a rat model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia, prior bronchial instillation of live but not heat-killed C. albicans resulted in increased susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge (Roux et al. 2009). Mechanisms accounting for impaired in vivo clearance responses were not identified, but C. albicans was found to inhibit AM respiratory burst ex vivo. While these intriguing findings require confirmation in other experimental model systems, they do raise the \u00adpossibility that Candida and perhaps other commensal organisms may contribute meaningful to VAP pathogenesis.",

Similarly, ex vivo treatment of blood monocytes from trauma patients with IFN-\u03b3 or GM-CSF, but not G-CSF, enhanced LPS-induced cytokine production, and HLA-DR expression (Lendemans et al. 2007).",

            "text": "These preclinical studies served as the foundation for several small clinical trials in patients with sepsis. Docke and colleagues administered IFN-\u03b3 to patients with sepsis in an attempt to reverse the cytokine imbalance and restore monocyte function (Docke et al. 1997). In this uncontrolled study, nine patients with evidence of sepsis-induced immunosuppression (decreased blood monocyte HLA-DR expression) were administered IFN-\u03b3 at a dose of 100 \u03bcg subcutaneously daily. Treatment with IFN-\u03b3 resulted in increased monocyte HLA-DR expression in all patients, along with a restoration of monocyte TNF-\u03b1 production to levels observed in monocytes isolated from healthy subjects. Resolution of sepsis occurred in eight of the nine treated patients (Docke et al. 1997). In two small single center clinical trials, the i.v. administration of hrGM-CSF to patients with sepsis resulted in \u00adimprovements in ex vivo effector responses in PBMs or neutrophils (Nierhaus et al. 2003; Presneill et al. 2002). Moreover, one of the studies revealed improvements in PaO2/FIO2 ratios, as a measure of pulmonary gas exchange, suggesting reduced lung injury in the GM-CSF treated group (Presneill et al. 2002). Prevention of lung injury may be due, in part, to the fact that GM-CSF is an alveolar epithelial cell mitogen and can protect the alveolar epithelium against hyperoxic and bleomycin-induced injury (Baleeiro et al. 2006; Moore et al. 2000) and in a murine model of influenza pneumonia (Sever-Chroneos et al. 2011). These preclinical and clinical findings served as the basis for a multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial of subcutaneous GM-CSF administration in 38 patients with severe sepsis and evidence of monocyte deactivation (reduced HLA-DR expression). As compared to the placebo group, GM-CSF administration resulted in improved monocyte function (restored cell surface TLR2/4 expression, TNF production, and HLA-DR expression) and improved clinical outcomes, including reduced APACHE II scores, shorter time of mechanical ventilation, and a trend toward decreased length of ICU and hospital stay. These studies and others suggest that immunostimulatory therapy for treatment of critical illness-induced immune dysregulation or even end-organ injury appears to be a potentially viable therapeutic option that warrants larger controlled trials (Luedke and Cerami 1990). An obvious concern of immunostimulatory therapy in patients with severe sepsis and/or pneumonia is the potential of exacerbating the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d of SIRS. Fortunately, neither IFN-\u03b3 nor GM-CSF has precipitated worsening of hemodynamic compromise or multiorgan failure, even in patient with severe sepsis or septic shock (Docke et al. 1997; Nierhaus et al. 2003; Meisel et al. 2009). Additional consideration could be given to compartmentalized immunostimulatory therapy (e.g., aerosolized delivery) to prevent or treat VAP. However, this approach may be limited substantially by ventilation-perfusion mismatching that occurs in patients with lung disease, and the concern that the leukocyte reprogramming that occurs during critical illness is not limited to the lung microenvironment but almost certainly occurs more broadly in leukocyte populations systemically.",

Increases in microbial resistance, combined with a burgeoning population of patients at risk, are trends that clearly make VAP a major clinical problem now and in the future. Preventative strategies and optimal ventilator management have been paramount in reducing the incidence of VAP. However, critical illness-induced reprogramming of leukocyte innate immune responses clearly contributes to susceptibility to VAP and VAP-induced tissue injury. Given our past failures, a paradigm shift in how we approach patients with evidence of immune dysregulation is required. In order for novel therapies to proceed, better clinical markers are needed to distinguish a deleterious innate response (e.g. SIRS) from a state of immunoparalysis (CARS) or mixed antagonist response syndrome (MARS) as the inflammatory response evolves (Wesche et al. 1999). Differentiating these quite disparate but overlapping responses in a patient-specific fashion will allow for better selection of patients in which immunoadjuvant therapy is more likely to be beneficial.",
