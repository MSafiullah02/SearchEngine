Methods for sampling viruses from hands are needed to understand the role played by hand survival and transfer in disease transmission pathways, and evaluate methods for interrupting hand transmission. Standard hand sampling methods have been developed for the evaluation of healthcare personnel handwashes against microbes (ASTM 2013a,b). However, the recommended test organisms for the testing of healthcare personnel handwashes are bacteria and nonenveloped pathogenic human viruses, including adenovirus, rotavirus and rhinovirus (ASTM 2013b). These nonenveloped viruses may not reflect the survival and inactivation dynamics of enveloped pathogenic human viruses (Vasickova et al. 2010), including influenza and coronaviruses.",

Ease of propagation and assay and lack of pathogenicity makes bacteriophages advantageous surrogate viruses (Sinclair et al. 2012). Use of bacteriophages allows for larger sample sizes and reduced risk to human volunteers compared to pathogenic viruses (Grayson et al. 2008), but surrogates for enveloped viruses are needed (Phillpotts et al. 2010). One candidate bacteriophage that has been evaluated as a potential surrogate for influenza and other enveloped human viruses is the bacteriophage \u03a66 (Adcock et al. 2009; Phillpotts et al. 2010; Casanova and Waka 2013; Turgeon et al. 2014). A member of the Cystoviridae and a phage of Pseudomonas, \u03a66 is a 13\u00b75 kb segmented RNA virus with a lipid envelope (Laurinavi\u010dius et al. 2004), giving it structural similarities to the Orthomyxoviridae (influenza), and Coronaviridae (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Although \u03a66 is a potential surrogate, recommended methods for sampling hands for viruses in healthcare personnel handwash testing have been optimized for bacteria and nonenveloped viruses (ASTM 2013a,b). There is a need to evaluate the efficacy of sampling methods for the recovery of enveloped viruses from hands. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate a range of candidate eluent solutions, including protein, salt and detergent\u2010containing solutions, for their ability to recover \u03a66 during whole\u2010hand sampling.",

Drying time after the application of the initial inoculum was eliminated, based on concerns that this would complicate the ability to distinguish between survival and recovery of virus from skin (Grayson et al. 2008). Prior to the first trial, the volunteer washed hands for 30 s with water and nonantibacterial soap and dried thoroughly. Each volunteer underwent six trials of hand sampling, where each trial involved: (i) 4\u00b75 ml of virus suspension in distilled water was applied to the entire surface of the hands for a target application of 108 PFU ml\u22121. (ii) Immediately after application of virus, each hand was placed in a bag with 75 ml of eluent solution and massaged for 60 s. (iii) Solution was recovered from the bag for analysis. (iv) The volunteer washed hands for 30 s with water and nonantimicrobial soap. (v) 70% ethanol was applied to the entire surface of hands (vi) hands were dried for 2 min.

Virus loss at each trial was treated as a repeated measure within volunteers and eluent as a trial\u2010varying covariate (because trials were always numbered 1\u20136, but an eluent could occupy any of the positions 1\u20136).

This is comparable to recovery reported for influenza in previous studies (Grayson et al. 2008). Viral loss during sampling was variable in these studies, which reflects other findings in the literature; experiments with influenza suggest that viral titres on fingerpads may be variable within the same experiment (Larson et al. 2012). Reduction of 3\u20134 log10 from initial inoculum to baseline sampling after a 2 min dry time was observed in one study (Grayson et al. 2008), suggesting that there may be substantial viral loss during the drying or sampling process. This study eliminated the drying step, suggesting that the losses from sampling itself, unconfounded by die\u2010off during drying, range from 2 to 3 log10.",

Although results from the small sample size should be interpreted with caution, these results suggest that protein and detergent\u2010based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling. Recovery may be of lesser importance when evaluating hand hygiene agents as the methods for the evaluation of hand hygiene products compare the amount of virus recovered after hand hygiene with the amount of virus recovered from a baseline hand sample taken before any hand hygiene agents are applied (Grayson et al. 2008; Larson et al. 2012; ASTM 2013a,b). Theoretically, this should control for losses from sampling as the baseline and post\u2010wash samplings will presumably undergo the same loss, but this study suggests that this assumption may not be valid in all cases. In handwashing studies, low recovery and high loss during baseline sampling may limit the log reduction that can detected in a particular experiment. Recovery efficiency of whole hand sampling methods is highly relevant for studies of survival and transfer on hands; poor recovery can lead to underestimation of transfer efficiency or viral survival.",

            "text": "There has been little examination in the literature of the possible influence of viral carryover during sequential samplings. We conducted experiments to determine if virus remained on hands after hand hygiene with nonantibacterial soap followed by decontamination with 70% ethanol, and no virus was detected during sampling following hand decontamination (data not shown). Also, if trial\u2010to\u2010trial carryover was an important contributor to the amount of virus recovered, we would expect to see a continual decrease in virus loss across multiple trials as the amount of virus accumulated with each trial. Our results do not suggest that this is the case; the differences seen appear to be chiefly between trial 1 and the subsequent ones; trials 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were not found to be significantly different from each other regardless of which eluent was used. It is possible that changes to the skin as a result of hand hygiene and sampling take place during the first trial. This may change the skin surface in some way that is either more conducive to viral survival or less conducive to viral attachment, leading to decreases in virus loss after the first trial. It has been suggested that natural skin oils on hands may affect influenza survival (Grayson et al. 2008); one possibility is that the reduction in oils on the surface of the skin from sampling and hand hygiene may create a more favourable environment for the survival of viruses on hands or a less favourable environment for viral attachment to the skin, leading to decreased virus loss after trial 1. However, it is difficult to say for certain what this effect is without measurements of what is happening on the surface of the hand, such as measurements of skin oils or skin drying. One possible study design to determine why trial effects are seen would be to have each volunteer participate twice. During their first participation, all six trials would be run with virus, as in the work described here. In their second participation, trial #1 would be run as usual, but with virus\u2010free liquid applied to the hands. Trials 2\u20136 would then be conducted as usual, with virus. This would give some insight into whether the application of eluent solution alone during trial 1 is causing some changes in the skin that would lead to decreased virus loss in subsequent trials. Measurements of skin change (such as changes in skin oils or skin drying using conductance and capacitance measures) would also help determine whether skin changes are playing a role.",

For effective sampling of enveloped viruses thought needs to be given to the effects of multiple sampling on the same individual; further exploration is needed of the effect of replicate sampling, eluent and changes to the skin surface on recovery from whole\u2010hand sampling. The results of this work suggest that protein and polysorbate\u2010based eluent solutions can recover an enveloped surrogate virus from hands during whole hand sampling; future work should evaluate protein\u2010detergent combinations to determine if synergistic effects between the two can boost recovery. Based on current work, protein\u2010based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling using the glove juice method.",
