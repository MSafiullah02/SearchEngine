The pAPN is distributed mainly on the surface of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, where some pAPN proteins are cleaved into a B subunit (aa 1\u2013572, 95 kDa) and a C subunit (aa 573\u2013963, 50 kDa) by trypsin (Kenny and Maroux, 1982, Semenza, 1986, Jongeneel et al., 1989). pAPN has been revealed to be a common cellular receptor for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) to allow their entry into cells (Delmas et al., 1992, Li et al., 2007).",

In the past 30 years, disease caused by TGEV and PEDV has broken out frequently in many swine-raising countries, and has led to heavy economic losses (Jung and Chae, 2005, Kim et al., 2007, Vemulapalli et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2010). Many studies of these viruses have been reported over the past decades, but TGEV and PEDV still exist and cause frequent occurrences of piglet diarrhea in various countries, notably in China (Sun et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2008, Elia et al., 2010, Ribes et al., 2011, Nogales et al., 2011). Most researchers have focused mainly on how to kill or control the pathogens TGEV and PEDV. Only a little information has been reported regarding anti-viral measures against TGEV and PEDV that are based on the cellular receptor pAPN (Liu et al., 2009, Ren et al., 2010).",

The scFv holds important potential for receptor blockade, pathogen neutralization and therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo (Haidaris et al., 2001, Pansri et al., 2009). At present, isolation and identification of interesting scFvs are carried out through a powerful phage display library. In the current study, the T7 phage display system was use to construct a mouse scFv library specific for pAPN, the common receptor for TGEV and PEDV. The scFv library against pAPN was generated, and the potential utility of the scFv library was confirmed by restriction analysis, sequencing, and specific antigen binding. The pAPN scFv library and its preparation will provide useful information and a basis for further research into anti-viral agents against TGEV and PEDV, and other coronaviruses that use APN as a cellular receptor.",

Here we describe a simple and rapid method for the generation and evaluation of a murine scFv library specific for porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a common cellular receptor for TGEV and PEDV, using the T7Select Phage Display System. Compared with other similar technologies, the T7Select Phage Display System is easy to use and has the capacity to display peptides of up to about 50 amino acids or 1200 amino acids in size using the T7Select phage display vectors of different copy numbers.",

(2004) were chosen to amplify the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) genes. It has been revealed that these primer sets showed good coverage for amplification of the whole VL and VH gene repertoire by RT-PCR. The VL and VH amplicons were connected by a flexible linker of 12 amino acids by SOE-PCR, to generate the scFv gene repertoire. A number of studies have shown that the length of the linker region between the VH and VL genes affects the activity of scFv molecules, and a linker 12 amino acids in length is suitable to maintain the affinity of the scFv molecules (Wang et al., 2008). In this study the mid-copy number vector T7Select10-3b with EcoRI/HindIII arms for directional cloning of appropriately prepared inserts was used to construct the scFv phage library against pAPN. Generally, each recombinant T7 phage produced by the T7Select10-3b vector is capable of displaying 5\u201315 copy scFv molecules, and is suitable for the stable expression of the scFv gene and other genes up to about 750 bp in size. The size of the primary scFv library and the amplified scFv library specific for pAPN was 2.0 \u00d7 107\n pfu/mL and 3.6 \u00d7 109\n pfu/mL, respectively. Although this is considered to represent a sufficiently large scFv library, the size of both the primary library and the amplified library was slightly lower than the recommended size (6 \u00d7 108\n pfu/mL and 1010\n pfu/mL, respectively). It is suggested that the inserted scFv genes may affect the growth of the recombinant phages to a certain extent.",

This demonstrates that there may have been some non-recombinant phages in the scFv phage library constructed. The phage ELISA indicated that, in the output phages of the third round of biopanning, forty percent of phage clones demonstrated a positive reaction with the recombinant protein pAPN-C. This result suggests that a large number of mouse spleen lymphocytes were activated and had proliferated as a result of the repeated immunization using the well-characterized native pAPN as immunogen. The pAPN scFv phage library will have a potential use for further receptor antagonist screening and analysis of the function of the receptors of TGEV and PEDV.",
