Respiratory viruses are the main triggers of AEs in adults and school-aged children, accounting for around 85%.8, 9, 10, 11 Viruses associated with AEs include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, and human rhinoviruses. Coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and the more recently identified metapneumoviruses and bocaviruses are also involved; however, they are less common.12, 13 Both RSV and rhinoviruses have been associated with asthma inception and are strongly associated with wheeze in infants; however, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. There is some argument whether rhinoviruses and RSV cause asthma or might be markers of asthma susceptibility; it is also unclear whether both viruses act in the same manner or are subtly different. In young children RSV bronchiolitis has been linked to increased allergic sensitization14 and immune skewing to increased TH2 responses.15 The skewing to TH2 responses might reflect a way of evading protective TH1 responses. Although related, these topics have been thoroughly discussed elsewhere and will not be the main focus of this article; interested readers are directed to other helpful reviews.1, 16, 17\n",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are capable of infecting the bronchial epithelium of the lower airway, resulting in a local inflammatory reaction characterized by airway neutrophilia, attraction of T lymphocytes, activation of macrophages, and damage to the integrity of the bronchial epithelium.7 In an effort to limit viral spread, host cells also mount a type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) interferon response. Interferons are antiviral cytokines made by a wide range of cells in response to viral infection and ligation of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Type I IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2 signal through the IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) 1 and IFNAR2 complex, whereas type III IFN-\u03bbs (IFN-\u03bb1/IL-29, IFN-\u03bb2/IL-28A, and IFN-\u03bb3/IL-28B in human subjects) act through the IL-10 receptor \u03b2 chain and IFN-\u03bb1 receptor \u03b1 chain.18 Interferons are the first-line defense against viral infection19 and induce expression of the distinct genes termed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through signaling through the type I and type III interferon receptor complexes.20, 21 ISGs can be extracellular proteins, such as the TH1-attracting chemokines CXCL10 (interferon-inducible protein 10) or CXCL11 (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant [ITAC]), or other interferons, with IFN-\u03b2 inducing downstream IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bbs.22 Most ISGs are intracellular proteins that interfere with and thus attempt to contain viral protein trafficking, nucleic acid synthesis, or virion assembly and release. Currently, the number of known ISGs is thought to exceed 38023; however, there is the possibility of cell type\u2013specific ISGs that are yet to be identified.",

Although the trial found no benefit in the primary outcome in the intent-to-treat population of 72 asthmatic patients receiving active treatment versus 75 receiving placebo, a beneficial effect was observed on peak expiratory flow (P = .033), and in a subpopulation composed of patients with more severe asthma (n = 27 active and n = 31 placebo), benefit was observed in ACQ scores (P = .004) and peak expiratory flow (P = .029). This finding supports the premise that interferon production is indeed impaired in asthmatic patients and that restoring this defect then beneficially influences clinical disease.",

            "text": "The impaired interferon responses seen in patients with atopic asthma to date are likely clinically important for 2 reasons. First, impaired interferon production in vivo would not adequately control viral infection and could lead to greater or prolonged infection, including progression and potentially the establishment of infection in the lower airway and associated virus-induced inflammation. Second, impaired interferon production might not counterregulate ongoing TH2-mediated inflammation, thus contributing to established TH2-mediated inflammation and thereby increasing disease pathogenesis and increasing risk of hospitalization, which will be discussed at length in the next section.",

            "text": "Not all studies investigating impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients are in agreement, with several studies failing to show any difference in interferon production between cells from asthmatic patients and those from control subjects.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 Reasons for this disparity mostly concern studies of primary HBECs, which are cultured in vitro for several weeks before infection and study. Differences in the above findings are likely due to several variables, including differences in viral strains used or their preparation,44 cell-culture methods (eg, different components of medium), or methods of propagation,39 and also recruitment and phenotype of asthmatic subjects, including the asthma severity, asthma control43 and atopic status.40 There also exist differing strengths of evidence for these phenomena between various studies and relevance to clinical findings, such as eosinophilia, atopy, or AE rate. The findings of these studies and a description of the level of supporting evidence are summarized in Table I\n.4, 5, 6, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 Although the majority of studies use rhinovirus as a test virus, differences in interferon expression using other viruses have produced mixed results. Newcastle disease virus and RSV have both been used to show differences in interferon levels between groups when studying PBMCs4, 32; however, a recent side-by-side comparison of interferon responses in asthmatic patients and control subjects with RSV and influenza virus did not show impaired interferon production in HBECs from asthmatic patients.40 In another study differences in IFN-\u03b1 responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells have also been shown with influenza virus.28 More studies with comparisons of rhinovirus with other respiratory viruses clearly need to be performed to better understand whether the defect in interferon expression is virus specific. Likewise, studies of impaired interferon production in nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic patients have produced mixed results,41, 45, 46 suggesting that deficiency might be more profound in lower airway cells, yet deficiency is still observable in peripheral leukocyte populations.28, 32, 47 The role of atopy is perplexing; Baraldo et al34 showed that deficient interferon production was a feature of atopic asthmatic, nonatopic asthmatic, and nonasthmatic atopic children,34 and studies focusing on allergic rhinitis without asthma have produced mixed results,4, 52 furthering the debate about whether it is asthma or atopy (or both) that drives this defect.",

However, enhanced rhinovirus replication in asthmatic patients in vivo during experimental challenge studies has been observed.2, 7\n",

Conversely, a subgroup of children with very low prevalence of asthma were also identified, and this group had robust interferon responses and antiviral immunity. Overall, the data strongly suggest that at least a subgroup of asthmatic patients exists with impaired interferon and antiviral immunity. However, it is possible, although currently unclear, whether asthmatic patients with impaired interferon production are a new and separate endophenotype or an important subgroup of an existing endophenotype. Despite the above differences in study design, the conflicting nature of some findings, and the above limitations, the number of studies that support the original work of Bufe et al4 and Wark et al5 continue to grow and now number approximately 20 (Table I).",

            "text": "Our mechanistic understanding of impaired interferon responses in asthmatic patients remains poor, despite much effort. The inability to identify detailed mechanisms likely points to a complex mechanism that is not easily understood. Initially, researchers considered 2 possible explanations. First was that impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients was due to a single gene defect, microRNA, or epigenetic determinant present in asthmatic patients. This hypothesis would describe the defect as static, unchanging, and likely identifiable in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or perhaps large gene expression data sets from next-generation sequencing approaches or protein activation data sets. The second hypothesis described a more complex gene-environment interaction that could involve a variable or even transient phenotype, immune imprinting, the actions of more than 1 gene, microRNA, or an epigenetic determinant. Thus far, databases of next-generation sequencing56, 57 and microarray data38, 58 have generally all failed to show a reproducible single gene defect that would explain the specific decreased expression of innate interferons observed in asthmatic patients. With the exception of TLR759 and the high-affinity receptor for the IgE \u03b1 chain (Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1) at 1q23,60 large published GWAS data sets on asthma again showed no obvious clue that explains these findings.61 The possibility still exists that a single gene defect resides in a very specific subpopulation of asthmatic patients but has been diluted in the larger studies that define asthma based on the clinical attributes or FEV1 alone and often involve several hundred donors. Considering the different cell types involved (leukocytes vs structural cells), it is possible that the mechanism responsible for the defect is cell type specific. It is also possible that HBECs, because of the culture associated with their study, are more prone to lose this defect, explaining the conflicting studies that have arisen. Considering the available evidence, coupled with the failure of several HBEC studies to reproduce this defect,38, 39, 43 overall, the data argue against the single gene-hypothesis and encourages alternative hypotheses to be considered.",

            "text": "Two studies have identified suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1, a negative regulator of type I and type II interferon signaling, as potentially important in determining impaired interferons in asthmatic patients.62, 63 SOCS1 expression in T cells and airway smooth muscle had been linked previously to asthma64, 65; however, studies of airway epithelial cells and effects on viral responses were few.66 In HBECs and rhinovirus infection, TH2 cytokines, and proinflammatory cytokines all induced SOCS1 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner. SOCS1, but not the closely related family member SOCS3, was observed to be of greater abundance in bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with atopic asthma, and abundance was related to PC20 data and atopy. In a small cohort of asthmatic children with severe therapy-resistant asthma,36 levels of SOCS1 mRNA in unstimulated cells negatively correlated with impaired IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb expression after rhinovirus infection and poly I:C treatment.63 SOCS1 can also function as a nuclear protein through a conserved nuclear localization sequence and might interfere with gene transcription.67 In the same bronchial biopsy specimens, SOCS1 nuclear staining was increased in asthmatic patients, and functional studies in vitro with mutants lacking the ability to home to the nucleus did not suppress rhinovirus-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 induction.63 The data strongly suggest that SOCS1, a virus and TH2 cytokine\u2013inducible negative regulator that is overexpressed in asthmatic patients, might be at least in part responsible for the impaired interferon levels observed. Further studies are required to support these findings, including bigger studies of SOCS1 expression in bronchial epithelium of asthmatic patients. A recent study showed reduced SOCS1 mRNA expression in bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with severe asthma compared with patients with mild-to-moderate asthma; however, immunostaining was not performed.68 The idea of increased SOCS1 expression in asthmatic patients remains attractive and provides a mechanistic link of how TH2 pathways can negatively regulate innate interferons.",

TLR7 is a single-stranded RNA receptor that uses the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) to engage a signaling apparatus leading to IRF3/7 activation and hence IFN-\u03b1 transcription. Furthermore, TLR7 expression was inversely related to AE rate and ACQ scores, strongly suggesting that TLR7 expression levels are related to clinical asthma outcomes. Studying expression patterns of microRNAs identified several microRNAs that differed between AMs from healthy subjects and asthmatic patients, and 4 of these showed identity to the untranslated region of TLR7. Further expression analysis identified that 3 of these microRNAs, 150, 152, and 375, were significantly upregulated in AMs from asthmatic patients versus control subjects. Each microRNA was not induced by the TH2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, and also IFN-\u03b3 and were not affected by steroid treatment. The importance of each microRNA in reducing TLR7 expression was then shown by using TLR7-specific luciferase reporters, and targeting each microRNA resulted in significantly increased interferon levels and ISG induction. Together, the data offer an important mechanistic explanation for impaired interferon in AMs from asthmatic patients in that decreased abundance of TLR7, an important PRR, is due to increased expression of 3 microRNAs that target the mRNA of TLR7.

Hatchwell et al49 identified reduced TLR7 expression in asthmatic patients in endobronchial biopsy specimens, which was related to impaired IL-28 (IFN-\u03bb2/3) mRNA levels. Work with a mouse model showed that TLR7 can be downregulated specifically by IL-5, and TLR7 staining in endobronchial biopsy specimens was inversely related to sputum eosinophil levels. Together, these studies suggest that in leukocytes TLR7 expression or function might be a key factor determining impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients. Although these studies show clearly the important role of virus sensing by TLR7 on AMs, leading to innate interferon induction, the role of TH2 pathways on this remain incompletely resolved.",

The discovery of important pro-TH2 factors (IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) produced from the epithelium that induce type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) now allows a more precise understanding of how respiratory viruses can promote TH2 pathways because the mediators are induced by viral infection and their expression is consistent with clinical manifestations of asthma, asthma severity, or features of AE pathogenesis.2, 3 How viruses induced pro-TH2 factors from the epithelium and how this relates to establishing TH2 immunity are depicted in Fig 1.",

Although the mechanism was not studied, it is possibly related to induced SOCS1 because SOCS1 is TH2 inducible, its levels are increased in asthmatic patients, and it is a potent negative regulator of virus-induced interferon production.63 Therefore establishing how TH2 cytokines can impair virus-induced interferons is a priority, and the mechanism could be an important therapeutic target.

The observations of increased SOCS1 levels in biopsy specimens of asthmatic patients and that SOCS1 can directly suppress interferon induction63 suggest a mechanism explaining why interferon levels ex vivo can be inversely associated with markers of TH2 pathways. However, it is possible that impaired interferon production might not be limited strictly to patients with eosinophilic or TH2-high asthma31 and that other mechanisms could explain impaired interferon expression in asthmatic patients. Considering the evidence that impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients can be associated with atopic asthma and the growing wealth of studies using anti-TH2 biologics, the above idea is a testable hypothesis, and future research should endeavor to examine the effects of TH2 biologics in clinical trials on interferon expression in asthmatic patients in vivo.",

Mepolizumab also significantly reduced rates of AEs and prednisolone use and improved the median time to AEs by 8 weeks.88 In another study of patients with eosinophilic asthma with a history of severe AEs, mepolizumab significantly reduced AE rates versus placebo up to 52%.89 The anti\u2013IL-5 receptor \u03b1 antibody benralizumab significantly reduced rates of AEs up to 57% in asthmatic patients with high baseline levels of eosinophils.90 Furthermore reslizumab, another anti\u2013IL-5 antibody, showed a 58% reduction in AE rates, which was not significant versus placebo in patients with poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma,91 and pitrakinra, an IL-4 variant that inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signaling, reduced the decrease in FEV1 versus placebo during allergen challenge in atopic asthmatic patients.92 Small molecules targeting chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells have additionally shown promise increasing FEV1\n93 and reducing eosinophilic airways inflammation,94 and a DNAzyme-targeted GATA-3 has improved FEV1 and reduced sputum eosinophil numbers and plasma IL-5 levels versus placebo in patients with eosinophilic asthma.95 These results are encouraging and show proof of concept that targeting TH2 pathways in atopic asthmatic patients or asthmatic patients with eosinophilia can lead to improvements in AEs.",

Although there was no difference between omalizumab and placebo before treatment commenced, after randomization, the omalizumab group had improved IFN-\u03b1 induction after rhinovirus infection, and this increase was related to the AE rate. Based on median IFN-\u03b1 production in the omalizumab group, those subjects with IFN-\u03b1 levels of less than the median had an almost 6-fold increase in AE rates compared with those who displayed a higher than median IFN-\u03b1 response. This observation is of importance because it is the first evidence that measuring IFN-\u03b1 response ex vivo can predict clinical outcomes in a clinical trial and provocatively suggests that a benefit of anti-TH2 pathway treatment might be due to restoring an impaired interferon response and increasing antiviral immunity.",

Increased viral replication accompanied by impaired interferon production in lung cells of asthmatic patients was first observed in 2005,5 and since then, a number of studies have repeated these initial observations, although some have not observed this. This work culminated in the first trial of inhaled IFN-\u03b2 for asthma in 2014,37 which showed a significant effect in a subpopulation with more severe disease.",

The inconsistency of some studies investigating interferon levels in asthmatic patients is likely due to subtle differences in laboratory techniques, including preparation and use of both viruses and cells, as well as patient recruitment and characterization. Furthermore, this phenotype in HBECs might be unstable. There is a paucity of studies measuring interferon levels ex vivo, and the study by Teach et al51 has shown that this is possible and meaningful. A further point is that future investigations of inhaled IFN-\u03b2 could benefit from identifying those with impaired interferon responses as a preferred study population; however, whether this is a stable phenotype remains unproved.",

The restoration of a defective innate interferon response could be a novel mechanism of action, and future studies of anti\u2013IL-5, anti\u2013IL-4, and anti\u2013IL-13 biologics should endeavor to examine this in detail.

Viral infection damages the epithelial barrier and results in the pro-TH2 cytokines IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. These cytokines act on ILC2s, DCs, and TH2 cells, resulting in production of the TH2 cytokines IL-13, IL-4, and IL-5. These cytokines have a central role in allergic asthma: IL-4 and IL-13 drive antibody class-switching to IgE in B cells, IL-13 can act also on airway smooth muscle cells, causing bronchoconstriction and contributing to airway remodeling, and IL-5 contributes to eosinophil production. Actions of IL-4 and IL-13 and viruses on airway epithelial cells can induce the eotaxins that attract eosinophils and the chemokines macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which attract TH2 cells into the airway. IgE cross-linking by allergen on mast cells produces histamine, leukotrienes, and the prostaglandins PGD2 and PGE2, which further promote bronchoconstriction. PGD2 binds chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) and activates basophils, TH2 cells, and ILC2s. Viruses can also cause oxidative stress, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) production can lead to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF, and IL-6. This generally results in neutrophilic inflammation and activation of macrophages. Allergen-induced IL-1\u03b1 can also promote the pro-TH2 response and lead to further IL-33 production and activation of ILC2s.
