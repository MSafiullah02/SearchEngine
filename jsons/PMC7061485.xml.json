But, evidence is still clear that the other 2 patients who never came into contact with the Chinese patient contracted the virus from an asymptomatic German patient who attended the meeting with a Chinese patient. This added to the ongoing debates about virus transmission, where some of the scientists believe that asymptomatic patients are transmitting the infection. WHO says \u201cPeople who cough or sneeze are more likely to spread the virus,\u2026But even if they do, asymptomatic transmission likely plays a minor role in the epidemic overall.\u201d Additionally, evidence from Germany reported that 2 out of 114 travelers (1.8%) from Wuhan, China, who had passed the symptoms-based screening tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [8].",

In this regard, body temperature might not be an adequate screening as it can potentially miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel and contribute to the importation of the virus to the countries of destination. Therefore, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas [1] and/or 14-day quarantine [15] of people coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 [6, 8]. Lastly, in previous experience from other viral outbreaks, i.e., dengue virus [16] and Ebola [17], fever screening especially at airport had a positive effect on partially blocking importation of cases. Kuan et al. [16] reported that airport fever screening was successful in identifying 45% (244/542; 95% confidence interval 33.1\u201357.8%) of imported dengue cases with fever.",
