Animal testing is key in the prediction of toxicity; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs are a prerequisite for the drug approval process. To maximize the chances of detecting toxicity of biopharmaceuticals, including prediction of putative interpatient variability in the responsiveness to the test article, selecting a relevant species for conducting safety assessment studies is important; according the International Conference for Harmonization (ICH) S6 guidance [1], this is a species in which the test article is pharmacologically active due to the expression of the target or, in the case of antibodies, to the expression of an epitope. In addition, understanding the relative sensitivity of the species or the strain to the pharmacological effect, as well as to other effects that may be mediated by the nature of the test item, is important. Finally, the physiological similarity between humans and the test species considered for the pathway or system to be evaluated is key. Appropriate selection of the relevant species that is sensitive to the pharmacological effects of the biopharmaceutical of interest enables the identification of factors that most reproducibly affect the margin between safety and efficacy (the therapeutic index) and the selection of safe doses for human testing.",

Their phylogenetic closeness to humans has naturally identified them as a model of choice for the safety assessment of large molecules. The high homology of sequences of many proteins between humans and NHPs enables target receptor binding or epitope recognition by a human protein or mAb therapeutic more often in NHPs than in lower species. This sequence homology for many proteins also limits immunogenicity, often allowing treatment with a human or humanized protein over long periods of time [2]. The rationale and experimental means by which the appropriate species is selected differ for small and large molecules. Nevertheless, for some specific targets, similarities with human anatomy and physiology are crucial in evaluating the effect resulting from target occupancy and modulation. For example, aging primates are used as models for geriatric diseases and osteoporosis [3]. Primates also are a species of choice for many ocular indications such as macular degeneration, retinopathy, testing of retinal implants, treatments targeting the reproductive system, or bone remodeling in various pathophysiologic conditions. NHPs are especially useful in the risk assessment for immunotoxicology of biotherapeutic proteins [3].",

These three species have characteristics and physiological differences that may render them either attractive, inappropriate, or unsuitable for a given risk assessment (Table 19.1\n). The presence of the target protein and the pharmacological activity of the biopharmaceutical are required, but not always sufficient, to ensure an optimum safety assessment; other factors need to be considered. For example, reproductive and developmental functions cannot easily be evaluated in the rhesus monkey because of seasonal variations. Some data can be generated from marmosets; however; their interpretation and their translatability to humans is questionable. One species may also be more predictive than another for a specific safety concern in humans. In addition, substrains of a given species from different geographical origins may also present genetic differences that may have a considerable impact on the outcome of biopharmaceutical evaluation.",

The rhesus macaque is widely used as an NHP model to study infection and immunity because of the close genetic relationship with humans (93% average human-macaque sequence identity) and because of the homology between human and rhesus pathogen genomes. Rhesus macaques have been used to study fundamental aspects of immunology, including the development and maintenance of T-cell memory, immune dominance, and the aging immune system. There also have been many studies of immune responses in rhesus macaque models of human infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, smallpox, measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [7]. Furthermore, rhesus macaques have been instrumental in designing and testing of vaccines against infections such as HIV and smallpox, in creating drugs to manage HIV/AIDS [7], and in understanding the female reproductive cycle and development of the embryo and the propagation of embryonic stem cells [8]. The genome of the rhesus macaque was cloned in 2007 [9]. Surprisingly, some normal gene sequences in healthy macaques cause profound disease in humans. For example, the normal sequence of phenylalanine hydroxylase in macaques is the mutated sequence responsible for phenylketonuria in humans. Some gene families are conserved or under evolutionary pressure and expansion in humans, macaques, and great apes such as chimpanzees (e.g., cholesterol pathways), whereas some are uniquely under expansion in humans, chimpanzees, or macaques (e.g., major histocompatibility genes are more abundant in macaques) [9]. The rhesus macaque was instrumental in understanding key features of reproduction. However, males and females are only fertile 4-5 months per year; seasonality is influenced by the geographic origin and is still observed after several years of being housed in a research colony in Western countries [10].",

They are also good models for the development of locally administered drugs, such as those for use in specific ocular diseases or prostate disorders, and for inhalation.

As an example, Chinese-derived populations of rhesus macaques have been shown to be more resistant to simian immunodeficiency virus than Indian-derived populations. Hematology and clinical chemistry differences also have been demonstrated in these two populations. In rhesus macaques, such dependence on genetic background is understood and used to guide research. Although cynomolgus monkeys are the most commonly used in the development of biopharmaceuticals such as mAbs and recombinant proteins, there is relatively little information on their genome in public domain databases. Nevertheless, cynomolgus monkeys originate from three different populations (e.g., Indochina, insular Asia and the Philippines, and Mauritius) with own genetic features. Animals from Mauritius and the Philippines exhibit potentially lower genetic diversity, even for genes involved in immune response [11]. Differences in the gene sequences of some target proteins have been encountered within cynomolgus monkeys sourced from different geographic origins (e.g., China, the Philippines, Mauritius), raising concerns that certain genetic variants might result in a loss or gain of pharmacologic responses in the cynomolgus monkey colony used for toxicology studies. Phenotypic differences in cynomolgus monkeys of diverse geographic origin, in particular for immune system functions, are well established, as illustrated by the diverse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetics of cynomolgus monkey from different geographic origin [12,13]. Collectively, these observations suggest that a prospective assessment of target gene variation may be warranted for cynomolgus monkey (and other NHP species) pharmacology and toxicology studies. Moreover, identifying a sequence variation within a target gene requires complementary target expression/distribution, epitope/binding, and/or functional readouts.",

In particular, marmosets are susceptible to a variety of herpes virus agents, including gammaherpes viruses, such as EBV and herpesvirus saimiri, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A virus infection, Junin virus, malaria, measles, and GB virus B, a surrogate model of human hepatitis C virus. The reason marmosets are highly susceptible to infection with many of these agents is not understood, but limited diversity at MHC class I and II loci is hypothesized to play a role, as mentioned above. In particular, marmosets have been extensively used to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of viral-induced lymphoma and EBV and lymphocrypto virus (LCV) model of viral oncogenesis or viral persistence [15].",

When the test item is a biopharmaceutical and the mechanism of action is dependent on specific receptors or epitopes, relevant species may be restricted to NHPs. The small size of common marmosets may represent an additional advantage because it reduces the quantity of compound to be synthesized and may translate into shorter development times. However, their short stature, sensitivity, and activity level may also pose unique challenges [16,17]. Nevertheless, for some development programs, as for canakinumab, the marmoset may be the only suitable species [20]. In addition, marmosets are largely free of diseases harmful to humans.",

The potential effects on the fetus and developing infant were addressed in a single enhanced pre and postnatal development study in the cynomolgus monkey. The decision was based on normal fertility, reproduction, and development in target knockout mice, or in mice treated with a therapeutic antibody blocking upstream signaling of the receptor, an based on an uneventful embryo-fetal development (EFD) study in cynomolgus monkeys treated with a therapeutic antibody targeting the same signaling pathway from gestation days 20 to 50 and undergoing a cesarean delivery on gestation day 100. Therefore, pregnant female macaques were administered the IgG4 weekly from gestation day 20 to approximately gestation day 160 and were allowed to deliver their offspring naturally and raise their infants. Maternal animals tolerated the antibody treatment as in general toxicity studies, without changes compared with control animals, and delivered healthy infants that developed normally with a functional immune system. However, an increased incidence of treatment-related perinatal mortalities was observed in infants. Macroscopic examination of the decedents revealed skull bone luxation; subdural, cerebellar, or superficial brain hemorrhage, all suggesting difficult delivery; and an empty gastrointestinal tract, indicating the absence of suckling after birth. Unexpectedly, treated maternal animals experienced a longer pregnancy than controls (up to a mean of 10 days) and a higher incidence of retained placenta, and prenatal maternal mortality associated in some cases with genital hemorrhages was observed. Dystocia is one of the leading causes of late pregnancy loss in cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and baboons, often resulting in intracranial trauma/hemorrhages in the nonviable fetus/infant [[33], [34], [35]]. However, difficult delivery rarely results in maternal death and is not usually associated with important genital blood losses, even in the case of placental retention. A careful review of the literature in light of the findings of the study suggested that the soluble target may indeed play a role in parturition, as indicated by increased circulating concentrations of the target during the third trimester of pregnancy and increased messenger RNA and protein concentrations in the cervix, myometrium, and choriodecidua during labor [36]. The target is thought to be involved in the local process of inflammation occurring at parturition, enabling recruitment of leukocytes in the cervix and uterine wall [37] to induce cervical ripening and dilation and probably resorption of the interface between the placenta and uterine wall [38,39]. It also promotes the expression of the prostaglandin synthase type-2 in the cervix, myometrium, choriodecidua, and placenta [40], enabling efficient contractions.",

            "text": "From a reproductive point of view, marmosets are unique among NHPs and differ from humans in some key respects. Females have no menstrual bleeding, each cycle results in multiple ovulations, and postpartum conception is not uncommon. Duration of the menstrual cycle varies from 24 to 30 days, with a long luteal phase, a mid-phase FSH peak, and simultaneous maturation of one to four eggs [43]. Ovarian cyclicity can be controlled by monitoring progesterone after triggering luteolysis by administering prostaglandin-F2\u03b1. As a result, controlled EFD studies are feasible. Multiple, simultaneous ovulations result in litter sizes ranging from one to four births; twins (30-70%) and triplets (20-25%) are most frequent. Interestingly, marmoset have a naturally high abortion rate to reduce the number of fetuses in utero, as they generally can nurse only two offspring. Compared with Old World monkeys, the father has to stay with the mother for the entire duration of the pregnancy to prevent abortion. Gestation lasts between 140 and 150 days. The interbirth interval is approximately 6 months, but conception can occur 10-50 days postpartum. In contrast to humans, twins\u2019 placental disks are supplied by blood vessels of both fetuses. Shared anastomoses in the chorion commonly occur, exhibiting a hematopoietic XX/XY chimerism in the case of twins of opposite sex. In addition, most marmosets are chimera from at least two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together. The difference in phenotype may be subtle (hitchhiker\u2019s thumb and straight thumb, different hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable [43]. In marmosets, as in most New World monkey species, chorionic gonadotropin hormone plays the role of luteinizing hormone (LH). Key differences are present in males too. The control of Leydig cell function and testosterone production by LH is entirely different from that of humans. Regulating genes on the Y chromosome are different from those of male Old World monkeys and humans, and some key fertility genes (e.g., DAZ) are absent. As a consequence, even if the organization of the testicular germinal epithelium is similar to that of man, the correspondence with the functional and hormonal spermatogenesis in human remains unknown. The reproductive cycle is considerably shorter than in macaques, and males attain fertility at 17-20 months of ages (for a review, see refs. 10,16,44).",

The only finding associated with canakinumab treatment was a slight reduction in the number of fetuses at the high dose, which correlated with a slight trend toward decreased placental weight. There were no treatment-related effects on fetal development. Despite the confirmation of placental transfer of IgG at the time of cesarean delivery (gestational days 112-114), given that transfer of IgG across the placenta starts late during gestation, it is unlikely that the fetus was exposed to canakinumab during organogenesis [22].

For reasons of practicability/availability, the cynomolgus monkey is the preferred NHP species, although occasionally marmosets and rhesus macaques are used. Nevertheless, there are safety-relevant functional differences between primate and human immune systems, despite a close evolutionary relationship. These include, for example, differences in MHC genes, distribution and function of Fc receptors and Toll-like receptors, and sensitivity to complement activation, which all need to be considered while assessing the safety of immunomodulatory compounds and, more specifically, agonists [45].",

The cynomolgus monkey has been used as a relevant toxicology species for immunostimulatory agents such as Toll-like receptor agonists; however, while special recognition regarding the clinical risk of systemic cytokine release for certain targets is warranted, the NHP is not always predictive of this potential toxicity in humans. An important difference between humans and other NHPs such as cynomolgus macaques is the stronger human T-cell proliferative responses upon activation via the T-cell receptor. This is the consequence of human-specific loss of T-cell Siglec expression during the later stages of evolution. CD33-related Siglecs, which are inhibitory signaling molecules expressed on most immune cells, downregulate cellular activation pathways via cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Concordant with this species-related difference in Siglec expression is the observation that several common human T-cell-mediated diseases, such as bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Type 1 diabetes, have not been reported in chimpanzees or other great apes. The lack of Siglec expression in humans may partially explain why the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in humans cannot be accurately predicted by NHPs or rodents. The life-threatening cytokine storm effects induced by TGN1412 were a result of the unexpected TGN1412-mediated activation (proliferation and cytokine release) of CD28-expressing CD4+CD45RO+ effector memory T cells predominantly residing in tissue [47]. These effects were not observed in cynomolgus monkeys, which do not express CD28 on effector memory T cells, nor in mice, in which the rapid T regulatory cell expansion quenched the proinflammatory effects of the relatively small effector T-cell population in these animals compared with a mature human immune system [48,49]. These human-specific differences in T-cell activation need to be carefully considered during safety assessment of immunostimulatory mAbs against T-cell targets.",

Binding human IgG to cynomolgus monkey Fc\u03b3Rs is broadly similar to that observed with human Fc\u03b3R [52]; however, there are some important differences. In humans, Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16A) is expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells, whereas the Fc\u03b3RIIIB (CD16B) isoform is expressed on neutrophils, eosinophils, and other cells. In NHPs there is only one CD16 gene, homologous to the human CD16A, which is restricted to NK cells and monocytes [53]. This difference necessitated the testing of an antihuman CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIIB)-specific mAb in human CD16 transgenic mice to assess the impact on neutrophils [54]. Even greater differences in Fc receptor expression, distribution, and internalization profiles between humans and mice also are observed [55].

Development was stopped in clinical phase II after it induced thromboembolism in patients [57]. No thromboembolisms were detected in preclinical studies conducted using cynomolgus monkeys. Further investigations showed that treatment in rhesus monkeys, but not in cynomolgus monkeys, resulted in thrombi formation at various locations and vasculopathy characterized by intimal hyperplasia. The full-length IgG1 induced platelet aggregation and serotonin release once bound to its target in humans and in rhesus monkeys. Other constructs based on Fab fragments or full-length antibody with aglycosyl Fc did not cause platelet aggregation or activation in vitro, nor thromboembolisms or intimal vascular hyperplasia in vivo, while binding to the target with comparable affinity. The mechanism is not fully understood, but one hypothesis is that CD40 may play a role in hemostasis and platelet biology by functioning as a primary signaling receptor for CD40L and by serving as a docking molecule for CD40L immune complexes. CD40 may drive translocation of Fc\u03b3RIIa (CD32a) to the platelet surface, enabling the Fc part of antibodies bound to their target to be captured and inducing strong platelet activation [58]. Based on these observations, the nonclinical development of a new anti-CD40L with a different format preventing Fc interaction was therefore conducted in the rhesus monkey [59]. This case study also demonstrates that the rhesus monkey may for some toxicities be the most relevant NHP species.",

In addition to complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which is an intended pharmacological effect of certain mAbs (e.g., direct killing of tumor cells), complement activation may lead to a number of safety-relevant consequences, including cytokine release, hematological effects, and/or potentially life-threatening hemodynamic disturbances. Despites large concentrations of complement components in cynomolgus monkey serum compared with human serum, the hemolytic activity is comparable.

In toxicology regulatory guidance documents, the TDAR is considered to be one of the functional assays of choice to evaluate potential immunotoxicity of investigational new drugs. However, the interanimal variability limits the sensitivity of the assay in studies powered for general toxicology evaluations, despite the similar behavior of sexes or animals from different countries of origin. Inhibition of the TDAR can be clearly evidenced with immunosuppressive agents in NHPs, but demonstrating a lack of activity in the assay has been problematic and the definition of biologically irrelevant variations is not established. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, (KLH), sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and tetanus toxoid (TT) are the most commonly used antigens for challenge; KLH and TT show similar interanimal variability and a trend to less variability than SRBC. Power analysis of numerous studies has demonstrated that animal group sizes of 8-12, combining males and females, could detect \u2264 3.1-fold differences in anti-KLH IgG responses.

Many similarities with humans generally result in a good concordance of pharmacodynamics effects in humans and NHPs. Several examples have demonstrated the need to use NHPs, especially to identify hazards in the reproductive and developmental assessment of biopharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, some important challenges that may impact safety and risk assessment for humans remain. These include limited numbers of animals and interanimal variability associated with some parameters, the stage of development of certain assays, the incomplete knowledge of target distribution or effector function compared with humans, and differences inherent to the species used or the provenance.",
