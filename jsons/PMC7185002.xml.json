            "text": "In early December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was later determined to be a novel strain of coronavirus, virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease was later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By mid-January, the first case outside of China was reported. Rapidly rising cases prompted the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency of international concern at the end of January 2020 and declare the disease a pandemic by March 11, 2020.1 The United States reported its first case on January 20, 2020,2 and currently has the greatest number of diagnosed cases worldwide, with more than half a million cases by mid-April.3 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every facet of the government and society, including first and foremost our health care system. Although immediate devastating impacts of this pandemic are apparent, secondary consequences are those related to obstacles placed on resident education, including neurosurgery. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical education and discuss some preliminary ways in which neurosurgical education can cope with these challenges.",

In an effort to preserve resources and reduce hazards for patients, the American College of Surgeons recommended suspension of all elective surgeries on March 13, 2020.4 Certain states, such as Texas, also have issued executive orders mandating health care facilities to postpone elective cases with legal repercussion for violators.5 Taken together, the neurosurgical society is currently witnessing an unprecedented decrease in clinical practice.",

In an effort to face this crisis, health care institutions have implemented a series of interventions. Those are largely directed to preserve resources such as personal protective equipment, rearranging staff (including residents) to maximize efficiency and minimize exposure risk, and creation of COVID-19\u2013specific intensive care units. This translated into the decision to cancel neurosurgical elective cases. Furthermore, nonemergent surgical consultations have witnessed a decrease, likely due to decreases in the number of patients visiting the emergency departments for chronic complaints. Lastly, outpatient clinics also have experienced a decrease, albeit not as prominent, in the number of patients seen. Surgical residents have long reaped the learning benefits of all previously mentioned aspects of training. Basic nonoperative skills such as performing physical examinations, dealing with consultations, and managing the ward/intensive care unit have been negatively impacted by such changes. More evidently, the large drop in the number of cases invariably witnessed by all programs due to elective surgery cancellations takes a toll on resident technical training. This decrease in operative intervention affects not only the technical training of surgical residents but also the postoperative management experience that comes with elective surgeries.",

Although elective surgical interventions have been cancelled, there is a subset of patients that requires urgent operative care in certain instances, such as progressive neurologic decline. Our institution, as well as others, has implemented a scoring system to determine the necessity and urgency of surgeries.6\n,\n7 This, along with an ongoing surveillance of hospital resources and disease spread, makes it still possible to conduct surgeries that cannot be postponed beyond certain time frames. Furthermore, although clinic experience has suffered, partly because of patients' reluctance to visit a health care institution, current technology can compensate and bridge this gap. Alternatives include phone visits and tele-medicine, including video calls. Although these do not offer the same experience as traditional visits, they still allow residents the opportunity to evaluate patients, review imaging, and form a differential diagnosis and a plan. The residents also can continue to conduct postoperative patient care. Furthermore, tele-medicine is being used in health care (i.e., stroke telemedicine) on a routine basis for certain pathologies, and resident experience with telemedicine provides an educational opportunity to participate in an advancing field.8\n",

As the neurosurgical community endeavored to maintain the safety of its trainees and members, numerous cancellations occurred in the United States, including the annual meetings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS). In addition, impacting resident education was the cancellation of the SNS 2020 Junior Resident Courses and the postponement of the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS) Annual Primary Examination on March 12, 2020. Globally, the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies has also endorsed cancellation of worldwide meetings until at least July 31, 2020.",

Fortunately, the neurosurgical community has made a tremendous adjustment through the use of modern communications tools. Online conference platforms have allowed the continuance of educational conferences and patient case discussions. These virtual meetings, although with limitations, have created a helpful alternative to face-to-face meetings and hands on experience.
