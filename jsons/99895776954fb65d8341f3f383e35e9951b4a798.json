Following its first discovery by Notomi et al. (2000 Nucleic Acids Res 28: E63), LAMP was further developed over the years which involved the combination of this technique with other molecular approaches, such as reverse transcription and multiplex amplification for the detection of infectious diseases caused by micro-organisms in humans, livestock and plants. In this review, available types of LAMP techniques will be discussed together with their applications in detection of various micro-organisms. Up to date, there are varieties of LAMP detection methods available including colorimetric and fluorescent detection, real-time monitoring using turbidity metre and detection using lateral flow device which will also be highlighted in this review. Apart from that, commercialization of LAMP technique had also been reported such as lyophilized form of LAMP reagents kit and LAMP primer sets for detection of pathogenic micro-organisms. On top of that, advantages and limitations of this molecular detection method are also described together with its future potential as a diagnostic method for infectious disease.",

In addition to the widely used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection, numerous amplification techniques were designed (Guatelli et al. 1990 ). Examples of popular methods used are nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (Malek et al. 1994) , self-sustained sequence replication (3SR; Fahy et al. 1991) and strand displacement amplification (SDA; Walker et al. 1992) . Each of these methods has a different set of requirements to initiate DNA synthesis. For instance, PCR involves heat to denature the doublestranded target DNA into single-stranded to initiate DNA synthesis. SDA uses strand displacement action of exo-klenow to produce target DNA copies from 5 0 to 3 0 and the procedure occurs at a single temperature (Walker et al. 1992) . These methods are widely used in all fields of science to amplify the target sequence. However, they still suffer from insufficiencies and inadequacies. All these methods require a sophisticated instrument for amplification and detection or elaborate methods for performance (Fang et al. 2008) . As a result, researchers and scientists have worked hard to overcome these limitations.",

RT-LAMP was developed to diagnose dormant HIV stage in infected individuals (Ocwieja et al. 2015; Odari et al. 2015) . A recent advancement was carried out by Damhorst et al. (2015) by incorporating a digital device with RT-LAMP to provide a smartphone-image of positive HIV-1 detection from whole blood. The assay showed sensitivity of 670 viruses per microlitre of whole blood. The digital RT-LAMP method could be used for the detection of viral load from a simple finger prick of blood from HIVpositive individuals in primary care amenities and clinical laboratory. The assay is functional for hospital-based infection control and for laboratory-based observations (Damhorst et al. 2015) .",

In comparison to the conventional Bst polymerase, OmniAmp polymerase was reported to be less inhibited by whole blood components, more rapid detection for diluted low viremia samples, more thermostable and perfect with a dry set-up that allows extended storage period at ambient temperature, thus it was more suitable for the development of lateral flow device and lyophilized LAMP.

This is one of the simplest mLAMP approach reported since identification of specific LAMP product was not needed. In this study, LAMP primer sets were specifically designed for each serotype of the dengue virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 targeting on the 3 0 -noncoding region (NCR). Interestingly, all the primer sets were added together into a single tube of LAMP reaction to detect the presence of the dengue virus within 60 min of a LAMP reaction. The samples used in this reaction was the serum of dengue infected patients and healthy donors. Colorimetric detection was performed by using hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), in which it allows the naked eye observation of final LAMP products. The sensitivity of this RT-mLAMP system was 10 RNA copies for all serotypes, and there was no crossreactivity with three closely related arboviruses observed (Lau et al. 2015) .",

Real-time monitoring based on turbidity using real-time turbidity metre (e.g. Loopamp Realtime Turbidimeter LA-200, LA-320, LA-500, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is commonly used for LAMP product detection. LAMP assay was monitored for the white precipitation caused by the presence of magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg 2 P 2 O 7 (a by-product of LAMP reaction) at optical density 650 nm every 6 s. Several studies have been reported using turbidity to detect the presence of desired micro-organisms, for instances, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Sakai et al. 2017) , Salmonella spp. (Mashooq et al. 2016) , human papillomavirus (Kumvongpin et al. 2016) and Clostridium difficile (Lin et al. 2015) . In case of unavailability of turbidimeter, a brief centrifugation of the LAMP products could be used as an alternative to observe the white precipitation, which is visible to naked eyes .",

Calcein dye, a metal ion binding fluorophore, which was added before isothermal incubation will form an insoluble salt complex, manganese-pyrophosphate (manganese ion, Mn 2+ from calcein whereas pyrophosphate is the by-product of LAMP reaction), thus making the reaction fluorescent. Subsequently, the fluorescence is further intensified when free calcein binds to magnesium ions (Mg 2+ from LAMP reaction mixture) and could be easily be observed under UV light (365 nm; Sahoo et al. 2016) . The reaction between Mg 2+ and calcein also causes the colour changes from orange to green, which could be observed via naked eyes under natural light. Positive LAMP reaction was indicated with green colour, whereas negative LAMP reaction indicated with orange colour. To name a few, calcein has been used in detection of Trypanosoma cruzi (Besuschio et al. 2017) , avian influenza H5 virus (Liu et al. 2013 ), hepatitis C virus (Zhao et al. 2017) , human papillomavirus , human coronavirus (Geng et al. 2016) and Flavobacterium columnare in tilapia fish (Suebsing et al. 2015) .

LFA is currently a favoured technique due to low-cost, user-friendly, simple, rapid, light and portable. The sample of interest, for example, saliva, blood, urine and other body fluids, is applied at one end of the strip (sample pad), which is conjugated with LAMP buffer mix and biotin, making the loaded sample suitable for interaction with the detection system. Most generally, lateral flow test was established using fluorescein in isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled DNA probes (which will recognize the specific region in the LAMP amplicon) hybridized with biotinylated LAMP amplicons (Thongkao et al. 2015; Fowler et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2017; Park et al. 2017 ). This complex would be captured by streptavidin on the biotin, forming another complex with anti-FITC antibody coated on the gold nanoparticles. This would give a visible result on the test line. However, the biotinylated nontargeted product would not hybridize with FITC DNA probe (only specific to LAMP amplicon), nor forming complexes with goldlabelled anti-FITC antibody to react with streptavidin on the test line, generating no signal thus a negative result on the test line. This complex would then move through the test line and was trapped at the control line (Chowdry et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015; Nawattanapaiboon et al. 2016) .",

Furthermore, the multiplexing approaches of LAMP is still considered less successful than PCR as they increase the difficulty of the experimental design and procedures .",

            "text": "It is also challenging to choose a correct and proper target for amplification, for either a highly conserved region or target site which is specific to a particular strain of micro-organism. Furthermore, in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity, LAMP uses 4-6 primers targeting 6 or 8 regions within a rather small segment of target sequence. Therefore, the primer design is exposed to many restrictions and it is problematic to design a LAMP primer. Even though a free online software is available to help with primer design, however, under certain circumstances, some of the preferred target sites might not be selected and, thus, would still rely on the need to manually design the primers. The usage of multiple primers will increase the chances of primer-primer hybridizations leading to template-free amplification, giving false-positive results (Watts et al. 2014 ), but the chances of false positivity require further investigation. In the case of the aforementioned phenomenon occurs, it is recommended to redesign the primers.",

This is due to the extremely high efficiency of the LAMP reaction. The LAMP product is so stable that it is not degraded easily and thus unintended carryover contamination can occurs (Bi et al. 2012; Dhama et al. 2014; Fischbach et al. 2015) . In case aforesaid contamination occurs, it is suggested to perform LAMP in a laminar flow hood and use separate pipettes and filtered tips. For procedures that involved opening of the reaction tubes, for example, gel electrophoresis, it is wise to carry out LAMP in an isolated room as LAMP is highly sensitive to even minute amounts of product contamination.",

Developing a mobile biosensor with LAMP technology application may result in a significant advancement. To date, LAMP was widely used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of human, livestock and plant diseases. However, there are few publications on the use of this technique for the direct detection of environmental pathogens. The development of a sensor that can detect the presence of pathogenic pathogens directly from an environmental sample may bring vast benefits, especially in diseases that are caused by environmental pathogens, such as Leptospirosis. Apart from that, LAMP could also be applied in the early detection of genetic diseases in a foetus, for instance, Down syndrome and thalassemia, as it has high specificity. The development of microfluidic devices with LAMP also comes with many advantages, such as easy to operate, palm-sized, high output applicability, decrease in the consumption of expensive reagents and do not require electricity. LAMP microfluidic devices are commonly developed for food testing, cancer screening and virus detection. In summary, all of the features of LAMP prove that its straightforwardness is beneficial for the on-site field or diagnostics in an everyday basis in a POC setting.",

            "text": "Schematic representation of LAMP reaction and its principle. LAMP reaction involved reaction mixture consists of dNTPs mix, Bst polymerase, fluorescence dye, primers and DNA template. Primer design: Design of primer for LAMP reaction and is characterized by the use of four different primers specially designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target DNA. Forward Inner Primer (FIP) consists of a F2 region at the 3'-end and an F1c region at the 5'-end; Forward Outer Primer (F3 Primer) consists of a F3 region which is complementary to the F3c region of the template sequence; Backward Inner Primer (BIP) consists of a B2 region at the 3'-end and a B1c region at the 5'-end. Backward Outer Primer (B3 Primer) consists of a B3 region which is complementary to the B3c region of the template sequence. LAMP reaction: The amplification starts when F2 region of FIP hybridizes to F2c region of the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis, follow by F3 primer that hybridizes to the F3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the FIP linked complementary strand. This displaced strand forms a loop at the 5'-end. This single-stranded DNA with a loop at the 5'-end then serves as a template for BIP. B2 hybridizes to B2c region of the template DNA. DNA synthesis is initiated leading to the formation of a complementary strand and opening of the 5'-end loop. Subsequently, B3 hybridizes to B3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the BIP linked complementary strand. This results in the formation of a dumbbell-shaped DNA. The nucleotides are added to the 3'-end of F1 by Bst DNA polymerase, which extends and opens up the loop at the 5'-end. The dumbbellshaped DNA now gets converted to a stem-loop structure (refer a and b). This structure serves as an initiator for LAMP cycling, which is the second stage of the LAMP reaction. Loop primers can be added as well for exponential amplification of LAMP. The final products obtained are a mixture of stem-loop DNA with various stem lengths and various cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops.Fig. 1was modified fromNotomi et al. (2000).
