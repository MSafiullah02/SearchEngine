In particular, the use of polymer-supported reagents4, 5, 6 in what is commonly referred to as polymer-assisted organic synthesis is an attractive technique that combines the advantages of solid-phase chemistry with those of solution-phase synthesis. In this technique, a polymer-bound reagent is added to a substrate in solution to effect a chemical transformation. At the end of the reaction, the polymer-bound spent reagent can be separated via filtration, thus simplifying product purification. Furthermore, since both the substrate and product are in solution during the reaction, conventional solution-phase analytical techniques, such as thin-layer chromatography, can be employed for reaction monitoring. The versatility of this methodology facilitates the process of library synthesis and has been the main stimulus for the recent growth of interest in polymer-supported reagents and catalysts.",

Recently, we have reported the synthesis of a soluble polymer-supported 2-phenylsulfonyloxaziridine (Davis reagent) 1 (Fig. 1\n) and its application to the oxidation of sulfides, selenides, amines, phosphines, and enolates.16 Although polymer 1 effected clean and selective oxidation with high yields and simple workup, it was not thermally stable and could only be applied to reactions at ambient or low temperatures. To address the need of some oxidation reactions that occur much slower and require prolong heating for useful yields, we sought to develop a more stable form of polymer 1.",

This was accomplished by first treating 3 with thionyl chloride to form the sulfonyl chloride, which was then reacted with ammonium hydroxide to provide 4. Polymerization of 4 with styrene using standard AIBN initiated radical polymerization afforded polymer 5 whose formation was amenable to KBr FTIR analysis (i.e., the appearance of primary sulfonamide bands at 3392 and 3269 cm\u22121). From elemental analysis data, the loading level of polymer 5 was calculated to be 1.20 mmol/g. This is consistent with the loading level of polymer 5 (\u223c1.2 mmol/g) determined via gel permeation chromatography (molecular weight of polymer 5=26,093) and 1H NMR spectroscopy.",

Jennings and Lovely19 have shown that addition of TiCl4 to a mixture of aromatic aldehyde, sulfonamide, and triethylamine in CH2Cl2 gave the N-sulfonylimine after ca. 30 min at 0 \u00b0C. However, when the procedure was applied to 6 and polymer 5, the reaction had to be carried out under reflux in order for the reaction to proceed (entry 1, Table 1\n). Polymer 8 that precipitated from cold hexane was an impure product (as shown in the 1H NMR spectrum) and attempts to purify it proved difficult as the product surprisingly underwent hydrolysis when washed with cold methanol. This could be attributed to the presence of a Lewis acid in a protic solvent, which causes the imine nitrogen to become protonated, thus resulting in hydrolysis. Attempts to use other Lewis acids, such as TFAA,20 FeCl3,21 and Ti(OEt)4\n22 gave very low loading levels of the product or no reaction at all (entries 2, 4, and 5, Table 1). To circumvent this problem, we converted 6 to 1-(diethyloxymethyl)-4-nitrobenzene 7, which was then reacted neat with polymer 5 at 180 \u00b0C to provide polymer 8.23 To prevent the hydrolysis of polymer 8, ethanol that formed as a by-product was distilled off immediately. This procedure gave a 78% conversion and the polymer 8 obtained was stable even when it was precipitated from cold methanol.",

To our knowledge, there are no earlier reports on the oxidation of pyridines with polymer-supported 2-phenylsulfonyloxaziridines. Hence in this work, we have investigated the performance of polymer 2 on such an oxidative reaction.",
