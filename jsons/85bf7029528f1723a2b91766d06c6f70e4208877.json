All the authors raise many questions to be answered and indicate possibilities for future research. This contributes to our impression that the book will be of value in the years to come. During the first half of this century, the spectacular effect of antibiotics on infectious lung diseases, including tuberculosis, had an unexpected result: very little attention was devoted by experimental scientists to lung structure and function. However, the increase of life expectancy in Western societies brought about a readjustment in the attitude of those involved in planning medical research. It became increasingly evident that chronic obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema and progressive fibrosis of professional or environmental origin are responsible for a significant fraction of morbidity and mortality in these societies. It was also realized that no significant advancement in our understanding of these diseases was possible without detailed knowledge of the biochemistry and cellular biology of the lung. Only a reinterpretation of lung structure and function in terms of modern matrix biology and cell behavior could lead to a better understanding of the above-mentioned diseases. The decision, in 1972, of the Heart and Lung Institute of the National Institutes of Health, followed by several European research establishments, to foster basic lung research surely played an important role in the recent increase in interest on the part of biochemists in lung structure and function. It became urgent therefore to produce a comprehensive monograph series on \"Lung Biology in Health and Disease\" to help scientists start original investigations in what was considered a \"no-man's-land\" a decade ago. Dr. Claude Lenfant, of the National Institutes of Health, has undertaken this important task.",

Dr. Ronald Crystal has successfully met this challenge by producing a concise yet sufficiently detailed monograph on the basic biochemistry of pulmonary function. The editor and his team have acquired a solid reputation in pulmonary connective tissue biochemistry, and this is certainly the best qualification for a valid presentation of this rapidly growing branch of science. Dr. Crystal is also to be congratulated for having chosen competent contributors to the volume as well as for not having dissociated the cellular and molecular aspects of lung chemistry.",

More impressive still are the gaps in our knowledge that are pointed out by the authors on each page. This book, covering 584 pages, fills a need that, notwithstanding the steady flow of handbooks, textbooks and monographs which have appeared during the last few years, has not yet been met.

Rapidly advancing developments in medicine have necessitated multiauthored textbooks in all subspecialities, and pulmonary medicine is no exception. In this first edition, the editors have limited their co-authors to six, thus improving the usual time lag in publication andj also, interauthor communication. Repetition is scarce and the text concentrates on current concepts in both physiology and clinical disease. The bibliography is up-to-date and well chosen; each chapter has references from 1975 and 1976. Divided into two parts, the text begins with a challenging chapter on pulmonary physiology. Air pollution, environmental hazards and variations in atmospheric conditions are discussed without belaboring the details of experimental conditions. Pulmonary anatomy is not mentioned; however, the reader is referred to the standard anatomy texts. Emphasis is placed on the physiologic importance of the ventilation-perfusion relationship and the use of flow-volume curves. Part If, dealing with clinical pulmonary disease, offers a balanced mixture of history and epidemiology plus sound guidelines for practical management.",

The reasonable (by today's standard) price will also make the book available to medical students and respiratory therapists. Both the physiology and clinical pulmonary sections are accurate and easily readable~ also, the work is well indexed, which makes it easy to use. This text is a welcome addition to the field of pulmonary medicine and should be available in every hospital library. The role of the immune system is to protect against micro-organisms and to preserve the integrity of the body by reacting with foreign antigenic material. Such protective immune reactions may cause damage to host tissues through the formation of complexes between foreign antigens and antibodies, by stimulating reaginic antibodies or killer T cells -thus provoking various allergic r.eactions -or by abolishing tolerance leading to autoimmunity. The lung is expected to be particularly exposed to such reactions because inhaled foreign material may come into close contact with immunocompetent cells and antibodies in the lung tissue, where it may cause hypersensitivity reactions of various kinds. In addition, the high vascularity of the organ makes it a common target for blood-borne immune reactions which damage systemic tissue. The clinical consequences of a deficient immune defense are particularly severe for the lungs when pneumonia and bronchiectasies, in particular those caused by bacterial infections, are commonly encountered in chronic antibody deficiency syndromes. Infections with micro-organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii, viruses and fungi are problems in patients with deficiencies of cell-mediated immunity. For pneumologists who have patients with immunological problems in their everyday practice, it is important to keep in touch with progress in immunology of lung diseases. This task may be served by the recent comprehensive and up-to-date review of clinical and experimental immunology of lung disorders given in Immunologic and Infectious Reactions in the Lung. The book contains 24 chapters written by recognized experts. It is sparsely illustrated with well-selected figures.",
