We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and we created a Markov model according to average COVID-19 incubation time. Results: Our model predicts that after 30 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections per person 2 , weekly COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers (HCW) would reduce new HCW and patient infections by 5.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce both by 2.3%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections per person, 2 weekly testing would reduce infections by 21.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce infections by 9.7-9.8%. For a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections per person 2 , weekly and biweekly HCW testing would result in a 1.54% and 0.7% reduction in infections respectively.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] Because of the higher risk of exposure to COVID19+ patients and shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) both in the US and in other countries, [11] [12] [13] healthcare workers have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection. [14] [15] [16] The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for predicting the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing for all emergency room staff as a possible alternate strategy to mitigate disease transmission in the healthcare setting, since PPE supplies are limited.",

Using the data at hand and the equation above, we can readily determine the transmission constant by dividing the number of new cases at time t + 1 (with time measured in days) by the product of infected population at time t and the uninfected population at time t, which we calculated to be an average of k = 1.219e-4 new infections per person 2 .",

For instance, if Im'(t) represents new HCW-to-patient infections, then In(t) would represent inpatient beds, patients leave the ED each day, whether that means they were admitted to the hospital or are leaving the institution, and a new batch of patients with characteristics representative of the general population would arrive each day. Therefore, the starting numbers of uninfected patients and infected patients that we used for our calculations stayed constant. In reality, the number of COVID19+ patients presenting to the ED may be disproportionately higher than in the general population, since completely healthy individuals without any acute illness or injury would not visit the ED.",
