However, data on the enzyme inhibition are scarce. The SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro has been comprehensively explored as a drug target, and many potent enzyme inhibitors have been identified.1, 25, 32, 33 Elaborated structure\u2010 and ligand\u2010based in silico models obtained using the SAR\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors proved fruitless for the identification of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (modeling studies conducted by our group, data not published). Interestingly, the 3CLpro enzymes from different CoV strains are known to share significant sequence and 3D structure homology providing a strong structural basis for designing wide\u2010spectrum anti\u2010CoV inhibitors.34, 35 Sequence alignment studies showed that the active site residues of the HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro that participated in inhibitor binding are conserved in the MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro, which has 81.0% sequence identity36 to HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro (Figure 1). Therefore, the bat HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro has been investigated as a surrogate model for anti\u2010MERS development.36 Novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro have been identified by using the enzyme from HKU4\u2010CoV as a model.36\n",

The training compounds in each subset were selected in such a way to ensure that each set represent a common binding mode and guarantee that bioactivities differences among its members are attributable to the presence or absence of pharmacophoric features. Applying this strategy allows an effective exploration of the pharmacophoric space of HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and helps to identify pharmacophoric hypotheses representing all possible binding modes assumed by 3CLpro.38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 These runs resulted in 677 successful pharmacophore models, which were then clustered using the hierarchical average linkage method available in CATALYST.

The close proximity between the ligand's thiophenoyl moiety and the sulfide of Met25 (Figure 3F) suggests the presence of a mutual hydrophobic interaction, which correlates with mapping the same ring against a Hbic feature in Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) (Figure 3C). Similarly, mapping the carbonyl of the same thiophenoyl moiety against HBA feature in Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) (Figure 3C) agrees with the hydrogen bonding interaction connecting this carbonyl to the thiol of Cys145 (Figure 3F). Likewise, the hydrogen bonding interaction connecting the amidic NH of the ligand to the peptidic carbonyl of His41 via bridging water molecule agrees with mapping the same NH against hydrogen bond donor (HBD) features in Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) (Figure 3F). Mapping the ligand's benzotriazole ring against RingArom feature in Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) (Figure 3C) correlates with stacking this ring system against the peptide amide connecting Cys145 and Leu144 in the binding pocket (Figure 3F). Finally, the hydrogen bonding interaction anchoring the ligand's tertiary amide carbonyl to the peptide NH of Glu169 corresponds to fitting the same carbonyl against HBA feature in Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) (Figure 3C). These findings showed that Hypo(K\u2010T5\u20103/N\u2010T1\u20101) represents a valid binding mode exhibited by the ligands within the binding pocket of HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro.

Both approaches have successfully resulted in the identification of novel potent inhibitors on a wide variety of targets. QSAR\u2010guided pharmacophore modeling is a ligand\u2010based method, in which pharmacophores are derived by extensive exploration of the 3D space of a carefully selected variable small subset of the inhibitors. These pharmacophores are then allowed to compete within the context of classical QSAR using GFA and MLR to identify combinations that result in finest estimation of the bioactivities. dbCICA modeling, on the other hand, is a structure\u2010based pharmacophore construction method, which relies on the accurate selection of the most successful docking/scoring conditions combinations. The success criterion is the ability of the docking run to align potent ligands in a way that would allow them to form contacts unattainable by low\u2010potency ligands. dbCICA can be considered a 3D QSAR that correlates ligands' affinities to their contacts with certain binding site spots by using GFA and MLR. Successful dbCICA models can then be translated into binding models (pharmacophores) to be used as in silico screening tools of virtual databases.",

The pharmacophores obtained by modeling the HKU4\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitors revealed structural features needed for potent 3CLpro enzyme inhibitors design. While, dbCICA models (structure\u2010based models) highlighted potential hot\u2010spot regions in the 3CLpro pocket that could be targeted using small nonpeptidomimetic molecules. Such knowledge is valuable for the successful development of 3CLpro inhibitors as anti\u2010MERS drugs.",
