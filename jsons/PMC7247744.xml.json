According to these results, it seems that patients without COVID-19 infection, despite their usual mortality rates, could benefit from an early surgical procedure and, therefore, they should continue to undergo surgical treatment if they are clinically fit. For patients with COVID-19, and older than 90 years, the mortality rate for proximal femoral fractures with surgery was 33% (1 of 3). The mortality rate is similar to those 23 patients from Spain [6] with a 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) mortality at a mean follow-up of 14 days. As the 12 patients with COVID-19 managed non-operatively [6] had higher (67%) mortality (8 of 12), patients with hip fractures should continue to be operated even with COVID-19.",

This tests for active infection and has a reported false negative rate of between 10 and 30%. However, testing was currently restricted to patients who require hospital admission, and the majority of the population has not been tested. During this period, the confirmed number of COVID 19 was 3000 per million habitants (0.30%) in Belgium. With a number of 152 patients hospitalized during this period, as compared to the frequency observed in a previous period, the risk of trauma was reduced of 30% with lockdown. However, the expected number of COVID-19 patients should have been less than one (0.45); we observed four confirmed patients with COVID-19, which appears nine fold higher than in the general population. The basis for this uptick is unclear. It is hard to say at this point whether this phenomenon represents a real significant increase (p < 0.0001) as we observed in our small series or a just random variation; only time and larger series will tell. But \u201corders to stay at home\u201d may reduce the totality of trauma in the general population, without reducing the risk in a particular population as those with COVID-19. The inability of society\u2019s most disadvantaged groups to abide by a \u201cstay at home\u201d order, combined with the heightened stress of the pandemic, and the chronic fatigue in COVID-19 patients may in part explain the increase of trauma in a subgroup with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The management of non-COVID-19 conditions during the pandemic, which is the more frequent situation, appears as difficult the management of COVID-19 condition, but for other reasons. One concern was to create pathways, ensuring \u201cCOVID-free\u201d paths for elderly patients in need of orthopaedic surgery. In accordance with the anaesthesiology team, we created two management pathways for trauma cases: one pathway for those who test negative, one pathway for those with COVID. There are no reports of contamination of patients in hospital stays in the literature, since this would be difficult to prove in a pandemic situation. However, there is a high probability that some patients with COVID-19 had surgery without diagnosis of the disease and were moved in the COVID-negative pathway. Because of the sudden impact of the pandemic in Belgium, there was an initial lack of tests for COVID-19 and protocols for testing patients. In general, patients who presented in the emergency department with any respiratory symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) were tested. However, patients who presented for any other cause and did not show symptoms on presentation were not systematically tested during the first period. The problem is coming from the fact that the confirmed number (0.30%) of patients in the general population is lower than the reality, since many cases are non-symptomatic, and the reality could be as high as 8% which is the number of patients estimated to have been in contact with the virus in France which has the same epidemic curve. We observed four patients confirmed with COVID-19 in our series; however, the number of patients having contact with the virus could be as high as 12 patients, with eight missed diagnoses. According to contagiousness that seems to start with the appearance of symptoms, even a few days before for some people, and a period of 15 days of contagiousness in asymptomatic people, we are certain that a part of our patients (negative for COVID-19) was directed in the wrong pathway (pathway COVID-19). Furthermore we know that six negative patients had exposure or contact with positive patients during the hospital stay. This means that despite two different management pathways, some patients were in the wrong pathway. Therefore, even with organization and recommendations, the \u201csafest place for patients during the COVID-19 crisis is not in the hospital.\u201d",

The pressure cooker of family life is a standing joke, but it hangs on the truth that for some families staying at home together increases the chances of child neglect and fractures. Then, there is the absence of any outside oversight which may increase the risk of fractures in children. The detailed treatment plan should depend on the children\u2019s infection status, their emergency presentation, and developmental considerations. By April 30, this global pandemic has infected about three million cases in the world. A recent study reported that only 2.16% of symptomatic infected patients were children [11]. For confirmed or suspected COVID-19-infected children, although some of them may present as mild or even symptomless infections, the virus may \u201cawaken\u201d and the symptoms might worsen with the progression of infection during surgery or anaesthesiology. We had no confirmed case of COVID-19 in our series, and it is difficult to know how many children could be infected (may be none) in our series. During the outbreak, the impact of insufficient medical resources for paediatric surgical diseases may be greater than the infection itself. Therefore, to avoid that children became perversely suffering for the benefit of adults, once the treatment is available, children who really need surgical intervention should not be delayed.",
