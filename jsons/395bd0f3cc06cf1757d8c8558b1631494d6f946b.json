The incidence of influenza H1N1-positive samples was highest in late spring 2009, followed by a decline in summer and early fall, when rhinovirus infections became predominant before H1N1 reemerged in winter. Our study also identified a focal outbreak of enterovirus 68 in the early fall of 2009. Conclusion: MassTag multiplex PCR affords opportunities to track the epidemiology of infectious diseases and may guide clinicians and public health practitioners in influenza-like illness and outbreak management. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of influenza-like illness remains unexplained underscoring the need for additional platforms.",

The first cases were reported in March and April 2009, initially from the Veracruz region of Mexico, immediately followed by reports from California and Texas in the United States (US) [6, 7] . By late April 2009 over half of the total confirmed US cases were from New York City (NYC) [8] . The virus quickly spread globally, with over 17,000 cases reported from 62 countries by June 1, 2009 . In response to the outbreak, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) implemented an enhanced citywide influenza surveillance program focusing on cases of severe influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) in hospitals [9] . To enable surveillance in ambulatory care settings, samples from patients presenting with fever or respiratory illness were collected in nine community health care centers over a period of thirteen months, and analyzed for respiratory viruses by Mas-sTag PCR, a multiplex molecular platform for diagnostic microbiology [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Peak numbers were collected within the first two months of the pandemic and again in fall and winter, coinciding with the seasonality of ILI in the northern hemisphere. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the DOHMH (IRB#09-031) and Institute for Family Health and consent was obtained from all patients. Samples were tested by MassTag PCR [10] for the presence of 13 viruses including influenza A (FLUAV), influenza B (FLUBV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human enteroviruses (HEV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1-4, human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B.

Notably, all influenza A virus-positive samples within the analyzed sample set collected in community health care centers from symptomatic patients represented the A/H1N1/09 strain. Reports on A/H1N1/09 prevalence in 2009/2010 vary from different areas of the globe. Some indicate that while A/H1N1/09 was the predominant virus in circulation, seasonal influenza nonetheless accounted for approximately 10% of influenza cases [16] . However, our results are in accord with a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that A/H1N1/09 was responsible for > 99% of influenza cases in the US between April 2009 and June 2010 [17] . It has been suggested that rhinovirus outbreaks in late summer and early fall of 2009 may have delayed the reemergence of A/H1N1/09 [18, 19] through induction of innate immunity. Our survey is not inconsistent with this model. The frequency of A/H1N1/09-positive samples increased in November, after the peak activity of rhinovirus in September/October 2009. However, whether HRV infection influenced A/H1N1/09 reappearance is unclear; late summer and early fall is the seasonal time for rhinovirus circulation and the observed pattern may thus be coincidental. However, our finding of a low co-infection rate between the two agents despite their overall high prevalence over the course of the study is compatible with an interference of rhinovirus infection with influenza.",

            "text": "). All influenza A viruses were the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (A/H1N1/09) as indicated by sequence analysis; one sample was positive for influenza B virus. Influenza A virus was detected in the majority of samples collected from May through June 2009, and again during November 2009 to January 2010, whereas rhinoviruses predominated during August through October 2009 and February to May 2010, when influenza A virus activity was low (Figure 2). The frequency of detection of human rhinovirus A, B and C species varied over the sampling interval (Figure 3). Infections were more common with rhinovirus A (41%) and rhinovirus C (39%) than rhinovirus B (20%). In September 2009, 14 samples (23%) were enterovirus-positive. Sequencing of a 500 base-pair fragment in the VP4/2 gene region indicated that all of these enterovirus-positive samples represented a single strain of enterovirus 68. The number of samples positive for this virus declined to six in October. Only four additional enterovirus-positive samples were obtained during the rest of the study; three were coxsackievirus A2 and one coxsackievirus A6. A total of 30 (3%) of 940 virus samples had evidence of co-infection with two or more viruses; 14 of these showed co-infection with influenza virus and rhinovirus (Figure 1). Collectively, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses accounted for 74% of all viruses detected in our sample set. Other viruses detected, in order of decreasing frequency, included HMPV (3%), RSV-A (2%), HPIV-3 (2%), HCoV-OC43 (1%), HPIV-1 (1%), RSV-B (1%), HPIV-2 (1%), HCoV-229E (1%), and HPIV-4 (<1%)(",
