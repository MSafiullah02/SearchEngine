Consecutive patients attending an emergency department during two study periods (February/March 2009 and 2010) were enrolled using broad inclusion criteria (fever/ preceding fever and one of a set of ICD-9 codes suggestive of respiratory illness); nasopharyngeal washes were tested for the most common respiratory viruses using PCR-based methods. Influenza A virus was detected in 24% of samples collected in February/March 2009, whereas no samples tested positive for influenza during February/March 2010 (pandemic H1N1 Influenza A having circulated earlier in October-December 2009). Rhinovirus (HRV) was detected in 16% and 8% of patients recruited over the two study periods, respectively. Other respiratory viruses were detected rarely. Patient data were then analyzed with specific PCR results, comparing the HRV-positive group with virus-positive and no virus-detected groups. Individuals over 65 years old with HRV presented with signs, symptoms and underlying conditions and were admitted to hospital as often as the other enrolled patients, mainly for dyspnoea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation. Conversely, younger individuals with HRV, although presenting with respiratory signs and symptoms, were generally diagnosed with non-respiratory conditions. HRV was detected frequently in elderly patients attending the emergency department for respiratory distress without distinguishing clinical features. Molecular diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and surveillance of infectious diseases should include tests for HRV, as this virus is associated frequently with hospitalization of the elderly.",

However, few studies have been conducted in adult patients attending emergency departments to estimate the burden of respiratory infections from HRV compared with other respiratory viruses. In our previous study [Pierangeli et al., 2010] , we showed that triage criteria based on case definitions of influenza-like illness did not lead to the identification of all patients infected with the influenza virus and also included patients who were HRV-positive.",

In patients aged 18-65 years, HRV did not appear to be the primary cause of illness: indeed, their diagnoses were either of a mild respiratory illness resulting in the lowest rate of hospitalization, or they were admitted to hospital for non-respiratory conditions. Conversely, most patients over 65 years with HRV were diagnosed with severe respiratory conditions that led to high rates of hospitalization similar to those from other respiratory virus infections. Patients over 65 years who were HRV-positive presented with abnormal chest X-rays with consolidation statistically less frequently than elderly patients who were virus-negative, most of whom suffered from bacterial pneumonia; however, abnormal chest X-ray results in patients who were HRV-positive did not differ significantly from those of other virus-positive patients. Overall, in patients aged over 65 years of age, HRV and the other respiratory virus infections contributed to about half of the diagnoses of dyspnoea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation; notably, HRV was the most frequent single agent detected in these diagnoses, as reported in previous papers [McManus et al., 2008; Kherad et al., 2010] .",

The inclusion of HRV in the virological diagnostic work-up of respiratory specimens may greatly increase virus detection frequency in acute and chronic respiratory tract diseases, without real clinical significance. Indeed, a positive PCR for HRV does not necessarily indicate an association with the overt disease, especially in younger adults, as evident in our group of 18-65 year-olds. However, the potential for HRV diffusion to frail patients should be considered, as emergency departments are important sites of pathogen transmission. Virological diagnosis could be effective in preventing transmission of respiratory agents among at-risk patients and in appropriate case management.",

As reported in this and other studies, HRV infection may resemble clinically an influenza-like illness [Monto et al., 2001; Pierangeli et al., 2010] and HRV cases might well confound syndromic surveillance. HRV was the most common virus detected in samples collected during the recent pandemic H1N1 2009 virus testing [Follin et al., 2009 ]. In addition, national surveillance of influenza in Sweden and France resulted in an alert for pandemic H1N1 influenza A circulation during the early weeks of September 2009 due to an increased incidence of influenza-like illnesses, the increase actually due to HRV infection [Linde et al., 2009; Casalegno et al., 2010] .
