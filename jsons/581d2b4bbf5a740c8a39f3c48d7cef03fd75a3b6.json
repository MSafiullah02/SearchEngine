In particular, this sequence-specific and powerful loss-of-function approach has greatly simplified the study of the role of host cell factors implicated in the life cycle of viruses. Here, we detail the RNAi method we have developed and used to specifically knock down the expression of ezrin, an actin binding protein that was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening to interact with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein. This method was used to study the role of ezrin, specifically during the entry stage of SARS-CoV infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) represents a quantum leap in the fields of molecular and cellular biology [1, 2] . RNAi technologies are powerful tools that are widely used to investigate the biological function of specific proteins either in vitro or in vivo. In particular, RNAi has successfully been used in virology to study the role of specific host proteins in the life cycle and replication of viruses. The introduction into cells of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), 20-25 nucleotide short double-stranded RNAs that are specific to target mRNA sequences and allow for sequence-specific degradation of the mRNA, is a relatively fast, simple and robust method to specifically downregulate protein expression and study their function [3] . In our studies, siRNA has proven very useful to validate the functional relevance of cellular proteins that were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens as binding partners of influenza and coronavirus structural proteins [4, 5] . We describe herein a method to efficiently knock down protein expression of a cellular actin binding protein, ezrin, and measure the knockdown efficiency. This method was successfully used to investigate the role of ezrin during host cell entry and infection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5] . While the method described here is specific to the downregulation of ezrin expression, it can easily be modified and adapted to study the function of other cellular proteins during viral infection. The methodology described also forms the basis for larger scale experiments such as siRNA library screenings (see Note 1), which we have successfully established to study host cell factors involved in viral assembly and release [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 118, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 119, "end": 121, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 973, "end": 976, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 979, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1308, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1740, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "1. 1\u00d7 siRNA buffer: 60 mM KCl, 0.2 mM MgCl 2 , 6 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 using 2 M KOH.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials"}, {"text": "2. 20 \u03bcM ezrin-specific small interfering RNAs in 1\u00d7 siRNA buffer (Table 1 and see Notes 2-4).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 74, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Materials"}, {"text": "3. 20 \u03bcM negative control non-targeting siRNA in 1\u00d7 siRNA buffer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials"}, {"text": "4.

The ezrin siRNAs used here are in the form of an equimolar mix of four siRNA duplexes. This allows for robust knockdown of expression because it increases the odds of binding to target mRNA sequence and silencing to ensue. It is important to note however that individual siRNAs can also be used to silence specific mRNA expression. This alternative approach has the advantage to minimize potential off-target effects of pooled siRNA mixes. We have validated the use of individual siRNA treatment for ezrin silencing, and successfully used an individual siRNA duplex to silence annexin A6 to investigate its functional role in influenza virus infection [4] . Another consideration when performing siRNA studies is the potential for functional redundancies found in families of closely related proteins. In another dengue virus study from our lab, we have found that, while individually silencing the closely related small GTPases Arf4 or Arf5 had minimal effect on dengue virus secretion from cells, combined silencing of these two GTPases allowed for marked decrease in secretion [7] . 4. siRNAs are used at a final concentration of 100 nM for transfection of cells.
