At present, only one formulation with broad virucidal activity exists with an ethanol content of 95 vol%. Therefore, efforts were made to reduce the ethanol content without reducing the virucidal activity to decrease the flash point and increase skin tolerance and compliance. As a result of these efforts, a synergistic combination was developed with an ethanol content of 55% (w/w) in combination with 10% (w/w) propan-1-ol, 5.9% (w/w) propan-1.2-diol, 5.7% (w/w) butan-1.3-diol and 0.7% phosphoric acid.12 This ready-to-use formulation is registered by the US Food and Drug Administration (NDC-6673-1230-(I)-(9)). Since introduction of the evaluated product in Austrian hospitals, no relevant unwanted side-effects have been reported to date.",

Briefly, virus suspension, 2% serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), FCS, double-distilled water and the hand disinfectant or the hand disinfectant dilutions were brought to 20 \u00b0C. One part of the virus suspension was mixed with either one part of double-distilled water, one part of the 2% serum albumin solution or one part of FCS. No protein load was added in the experiments with rotavirus, since FCS has rotavirus-inhibitory and trypsin-neutralizing activity. Then, eight parts of the formulation were added to each preparation. The mixtures were kept at 20 \u00b0C (in a water bath) for the exposure period. At the end of the exposure period, 10-fold serial dilutions of the control and test samples were prepared immediately in ice-cold culture medium (0.5 mL sample +4.5 mL medium), inoculated into respective host cells in suspension, placed in 96-well microtitre plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA), and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Six or eight wells per sample dilution were inoculated. Virus control preparations contained identical protein concentrations. The cytopathic effect was recorded microscopically, and infectious virus titre in CCID50 was evaluated by the endpoint dilution method of Reed and Muench.16 The log10 of the reduction factor, hereafter called the reduction factor (RF), was determined by subtracting the logarithmic titre CCID50 at any test point from the logarithmic titre CCID50 of the virus control. The 95% confidence limits of the reduction factors were obtained according to the EMEA guideline.17 In this quantitative suspension test, a disinfectant solution was considered to have virucidal efficacy if, within the tested exposure period, the titre was reduced at least 104-fold (RF=4, inactivation 99.99%). This does not mean that an RF of 4 is regarded as sufficient for practical purposes. However, in general, the virucidal efficacy can not be followed over a titre range of more than 104-fold due to the cytotoxicity of the substances tested. In fingerpad methods, the efficacy of a hand disinfectant has to be considered by comparison with a selected reference.",
