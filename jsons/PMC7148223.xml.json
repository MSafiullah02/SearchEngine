A salient behavioural facet that has been widely captured and analysed by those studies is query history. The latter is generally structured into \u201cquery sessions\u201d which are sequences of queries submitted by a user while completing a search activity with a search system. In the literature review, there are many definitions of query sessions. The widely used definitions are the following [19, 25]: (1) a Time-based session, also called physical session in [6], is a set of consecutive queries automatically delimited using a time-out threshold on user\u2019s activities. Time-gap values of 30 min and 90 min have been the most commonly used in previous research [4, 6, 9, 19]; (2) a Task-based session, also called mission in [6], is a set of queries that are possibly neither consecutive nor within the same time-based session. The queries belong to related information needs that are driven by a goal-oriented search activity, called search task (eg., job search task). The latter could be achieved by subsets of consecutive related queries called logical sessions in [6] or subtasks in [9].",

Such long-term tasks are acknowledged as being complex tasks [7, 9]. Figure 1 shows a sample of 3 time-based search sessions extracted from the Webis-SMC-12 Search Corpus [6] for a single user. The sessions are manually annotated with tasks. As can be seen, 6 tasks (Task 1 - Task 6) are performed by the user during these 3 sessions. We can observe that all these sessions are multi-tasking, since they include queries that relate to multiple tasks (eg., Session 1 is multi-tasking since it includes queries that relate to Task 1, 2, 3 and 4). We can also see that Task 1 and Task 3 are interleaved within and across sessions (eg., Task 1 is interleaved within Session 1 and across Session 1, 2 and 3). Thus, Tasks 1 and 3 are multi-session tasks.\n",

Our ultimate goal is to gain insights regarding the relevance of using user\u2019s tasks as the focal units of search to both understand and predict query reformulations. With this in mind, we perform large-scale log analyses of users naturally engaged in tasks to examine query reformulations from both the time-based session vs. task-based session perspectives. Moreover, we show the role of the task characteristics in predicting the next user\u2019s query. Our findings clearly show that task is an additional relevant search unit that helps to better understand user\u2019s query reformulation patterns and to predict the next user\u2019s query.",

To identify query reformulation patterns, most of the previous works used large-scale log analyses segmented into time-based sessions. Different time gaps have been used including 10\u201315 min [8], 30 min [4, 19] and 90 min [6, 9]. In a significant body of work, authors categorised the transitions made from one query to the subsequent queries through syntactic changes [11, 12, 23, 26] and query semantic changes [10, 12, 33]. Syntactic changes include word substitution, removing, adding and keeping. The results highlighted that the query and its key terms evolve throughout the session regardless of the query position in the session. Moreover, such strategies are more likely to cause clicks on highly ranked documents. Further experiments on semantic query changes through generalisation vs. specialisation [10, 12] showed that a trend exists toward going from generalisation to specialisation. This behavioural pattern represents a standard building-box strategy while specialisation occurs early in the session.",

First, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study examined the differences in query reformulation strategies from the two perspectives of time-based sessions and task-based sessions viewed as background contexts. Insights gleaned from our data analysis have implications for designing task-based search systems. Second, although there has been intensive research on query reformulation, we provide a new insight into the variation of query reformulation strategies. The latter are analysed in relation with search episode size (Short, Medium and Long) and search stage (Start, Middle and End) from two different viewpoints (stream of query history and the search task progress). Third, building on the characterisation of search tasks, we provide insights on how considering task features might improve a supervised predictive model of query reformulations.",

The query log is automatically segmented into time-based sessions using a time-gap threshold on users\u2019 activities.

            "text": "Based on those categorisations, Fig. 2 shows the variation of the query length limit within each category of sessions and tasks and along the different search stages. We can see two clear trends. First, queries in both longer sessions and longer tasks generally tend to contain more terms (2.60\u20132.87 vs. 2.41\u20132.51 in average). This trend remains along all the different search stages. Regarding sessions, previous studies [2] have also shown similar trends in log-based data. Regarding tasks, our results suggest that long tasks require to issue more search terms. One could argue that long tasks, that more likely involve complex information needs, lead users to formulate more informative queries. We also relate this observation with previous findings [2] showing that increased success is associated with longer queries, particularly in complex search tasks. Second we can surprisingly see that in general, queries observed within sessions whatever their sizes, are slightly longer in average than queries issued within tasks of the same category except at the end of the search stage. By cross-linking with the CDF results presented in Table 3, we expect that this observation particularly relates to long sessions. One possible explanation is that since long sessions are more likely to be multi-tasking (eg., there are 1.57 task in average in the long 90-min sessions vs. 1.29 in the 30-min sessions), the average query length is particularly increased within sessions that include queries at late search stages of the associated tasks (Middle, End).\n",

Significance of the differences between the \u201cWithin Session\u201d scenario and the \u201cWithin Task\u201d scenario considering either the short-term context (SC) or the long-term context (LC) is computed using the non-paired student t-test. We can see from Table 4 that for the whole set of search actions (ie., term-retention Rr, term-removal Rm and term-adding Ra) and similarity values (ie., Avg Sim), most of the differences between task-based and session-based scenarios are highlighted as significant. More particularly, we can make two key observations: (1) successive queries in both medium and long tasks are significantly more similar (Avg Sim of 0.27 and 0.25 respectively) than they are in medium and long sessions for both time-out thresholds (Avg Sim of 0.20\u20130.23) with higher ratios of term-retention (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$34\\%$$\\end{document} vs. 25\u201329%); and (2) the query history along long tasks exhibits a higher topical cohesion (Avg Sim of 0.24) than it does in long sessions (Avg Sim of 0.18\u20130.20) with a higher ratio of term-retention (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$30\\%$$\\end{document} vs. 23\u201326%) and a lower ratio of term-adding (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$70\\%$$\\end{document} vs. 74\u201377%) for tasks. All these results are consistent with those obtained through the analysis of query term repeat (Sect. 4.2). They suggest that longer tasks more likely include topically and lexically closer information needs that might drive subtasks in comparison with long sessions. Unlikely, the latter might include multiple and topically different information needs that belong to distinct tasks.\n",

Through the analysis of large-scale query logs annotated with task labels, we have revealed significant differences in the query changes trends along the search depending on the retrospective context used, either session or task. We found that queries are even longer in longer tasks with however a lower level of term reuse in tasks than in sessions. In addition, terms are particularly renewed in long tasks indicating clear shifts in information needs. Using lexical similarity measures, we have also shown that the query reformulations exhibit a clearer cohesiveness within tasks than within sessions along the different search stages, with however a decreasing level of similarity. Finally, we provided insights on the usefulness of task features to enhance the user\u2019s next query prediction accuracy. Given the crucial lack of query logs with annotated tasks, we acknowledge that the predictive model has been trained and tested with limited amount of data. However, the features used are based on the analysis performed on a large-scale data provided in the Webis corpus. Thus, we believe that the trend of our results would remain reliable.",

Firstly, evidence related to the characterization of tasks through query length variation and query reformulation similarities along the search, presented in Sects. 4 and 5, may benefit research on automatic task boundary detection. In Sect. 6, we showed that learning from query streams annotated with tasks helps the query suggestion process particularly for long-term tasks. It will be interesting to design a predictive model of query trails associated with subtasks, by analogy to search trails [30]. This might help users in completing complex tasks by issuing fewer queries. This would decrease the likeliness of search struggling as shown in previous work [22].",
