We have studied the cell tropisms of two virulent strains (CDV-SH and CDV A75-17) and an attenuated strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), in cultured canine brain cells. Infected cell types were identified by double immunofluorescent labeling of specific cell markers and viral antigens. All viral strains studied produced infection in astrocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Neurons were not infected by CDV A75-17 but were rapidly infected by CDV-SH and CDV-RO. Multipolar oligodendrocytes were very rarely infected by any of the virus strains. In contrast, a morphologically distinct subset of bipolar oligodendrocytes were commonly infected by CDV-SH and CDV-RO. The kinetics of infection in the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and macrophages varied between strains. Both CDV-SH and CDV-RO rapidly infected bipolar oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages by 14 days post infection while infection by CDV A75-17 was delayed until after 28-35 days post infection. The differences in the growth kinetics and cell tropisms for some brain cells, exhibited by the three viral strains examined in this in vitro study, may relate to the different CNS symptoms that these strains produce in vivo.",

Two virulent strains, CDV-Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) and CDV A75-17, extensively studied in this and other laboratories, produce contrasting forms of Canine Distemper Encephalitis (Appel, 1969; Summers et al., 1979 Summers et al., ,1984 . The A75-17 strain typically produces a subacute to chronic disease of white matter with prominent glial cell infection and demyelination in the CNS while the Snyder Hill strain (CDV-SH) results in an acute CNS gray matter disease with neuronal infection. Attenuated strains of this virus, such as CDV-Rockborn (CDV-RO), are used for vaccinal purposes in dogs. Given the in vivo biological differences between these CDV strains, the question arises as to whether the 0 1 9 9 1 Wiley-Liss, Inc. differences in disease phenotypes are related to differences in CNS cell tropisms. In the experiments reported here we have examined growth properties of these different CDV strains in specific CNS cell types. Owing to the obvious importance of the myelin forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, during CNS demyelination, we have focused much of our attention on this cell in these studies.",

The method for derivation of mixed brain cells from cerebrum was a modification of the McCarthy and deVellis (1980) technique as previously described (Pearce-Kelling et al., 1990) . For comparison, cerebellar tissue was cultured by a method of Zurbriggen and co-workers (Zurbriggen et al., 1984) . Briefly, the cerebellum was minced with scalpel blades and transferred to a centrifuge tube; 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose were added, the tissue was triturated through a 5.0 ml pipet ten times, and the suspension was allowed to settle. The supernatant fluid was saved and these steps were repeated until 45 ml of cell suspension were obtained. To this, 5 ml of FCS was added. Five 10 ml aliquots of the cell suspension (1.5 x lo6 live cells per ml) were dispensed into Petri dishes (Falcon 100 x 20 mm). Ten glass coverslips, 22 mm in diameter (Roboz Brand), had been adhered to the bottoms of these dishes with sterile silicon (Dow, Corning).",

The primary antisera used to identify these cells and their conditions for fixation and staining are shown in Table 1 . Cultures were fixed for 10 min in the appropriate fixative (see Table 1 ) and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). When possible, acetone was employed as a fixative because this produced optimal immunofluorescent detection of CDV. Incubation with primary antisera against the specific cell markers was followed by two 5 min rinses in PBS before the secondary incubation. Secondary antibody was either goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (depending on the source of the primary antibody) conjugated to rhodamine and diluted in PBS 1:20. Viral antigen within the labelled cells was then identified with fluoresceinated anti-CDV hyperimmune dog serum prepared in this laboratory by the methods of The and Feltkamp (19701, which was applied as a final step. Each incubation with antibody in all procedures was performed for 30 min at room temperature. Stained coverslips were washed in PBS, dipped in distilled water, and mounted in gelvatol to preserve fluorescence (Johnson et al., 1982) . Negative controls included stained uninfected cultures and the omission of primary antisera during the staining procedure. Labeled cells were viewed on a Leitz epifluorescent microscope equipped with rhodamine (530-560 nm) and fluorescein (470-490 nm) filters.",

In previous studies of cultured canine brain cells (Zurbriggen et al., 1984 (Zurbriggen et al., , 1987a , oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, macrophages, neurons, and fibroblasts were described, however only one type of oligodendrocyte was noted. The oligodendrocytes described in studies of Zurbriggen and Vandevelde appear similar to the multibranched GC+ cells we have observed (as shown in Fig. 1B) and which others have illustrated in the rat and mouse (McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980; Knapp et al., 1987) . Although most of the brain cell types survived comparably when grown from either the cerebrum or the cerebellum, the multipolar oligodendrocyte was most successfully cultured by the cerebellar technique. Several factors may bear on this difference: 1) intrinsic differences between cerebral and cerebellar tissue, 2) the differences in cell density at time of plating, 3) the shorter preparation time for the cerebellar cultures, and 4) the absence of trypsin treatment for cerebellar tissue. We have yet to elucidate what, if any, relationship exists between the two morphological subsets of GC+ cells in our cultures. Each may represent a different functional subtype of oligodendrocyte, or alternatively they may be related in a differentiation pathway. In recent years, tissue culture studies have yielded much information on the maturation of neuroglia from pro-genitor cells. In the rat optic nerve (Raff et al., 1983) and sheep (Elder et al., 1988) and perhaps in other species, type I astrocytes arise from one progenitor cell while oligodendrocytes and type I1 astrocytes arise from a second common precursor called the 0-2A progenitor. Raff and co-workers (1983) have described this 0-2A progenitor as a mobile, bipolar cell. The bipolar GC+ cells we have observed in our cultures are of similar morphology, as are some of the GFAP+ cells present in these cultures. We have also observed a similar cell type, which was commonly infected by all strains of CDV, and which expresses the HNK-1 marker (data not shown). This antibody marks several glycoproteins found on a variety of CNS cell types and thus cannot be associated with a specific cell type. As these cultures are derived from neonatal tissue (animals less than 3 days of age), the presence of recently differentiated cell types is to be expected.",

The two virulent strains produce differing forms of encephalitis: CDV-SH results in an acute, primarily gray matter disease, while CDV A75-17 causes a delayed onset of CNS signs marked by demyelination with more sporadic gray matter involvement (Summers et al., 1984) . In this in vitro study we examined whether these strain-dependent differences could be clearly related to contrasting tropisms for cells of the CNS. For some cells, this did not appear to be the case. All cell types examined, except neurons and multipolar oligodendrocytes, supported infection with all three viral strains studied. CDV-RO and CDV-SH produced widespread infection in bipolar oligodendrocytes, macrophages, and astrocytes by 14 dpi. CDV A75-17 was also observed in all cell types except neurons and multipolar oligodendrocytes; however, the infection was restricted to small foci and low percentages of infected cell types until 28-35 dpi. We previously described the contrasting kinetics of astrocyte infection by different CDV viral strains (Pearce-Kelling et al., 1990) . In these studies we observed rapid infection by CDV-SH and CDV-RO and more delayed growth with CDV A75-17. As our current study has shown, similar differences in the kinetics of infection occur in several other CNS cell types, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and bipolar oligodendrocytes. These differences in kinetics of growth of brain cells are in contrast to the equivalent growth rates that the two virulent strains exhibit in cultured dog lymphocytes and lung macrophages (Appel, unpublished data) .",

We have observed the infection of neurons in canine brain cell cultures by CDV A75-17 which has been modified by passaging it through brain cell cultures (Pearce-Kelling, unpublished data). This suggests that, given time, CDV A75-17 can infect neurons in culture. These observations further support our previous speculation that a rapid and widespread infection, especially of neurons, as occurs with CDV-SH, in vivo, may directly relate to neuronal destruction and acute death of the dog. In contrast, the slowly spreading infection, as occurs with CDV A75-17 in vitro, may reflect an adaptation of this strain to the CNS environment. This slow adaptive growth may also occur in the CNS of the infected dog and result in this strain's characteristic delayed onset of neurological signs.",

The multipolar oligodendrocytes appear to be refractory to infection, consistent with the observations of others (Zurbriggen, et al., 1986 (Zurbriggen, et al., , 1987b . Recently Glaus and co-workers (1990) have reported that 2 to 3% of oligodendrocytes in culture were CDV infected. In multiple replicate experiments however, we observed CDV fluorescence in the majority of bipolar GC+ cells by 21 dpi in CDV-SH and CDV-RO infected cultures. In an effort to understand the observed differential response to CDV by the different subtypes of oligodendrocytes in our cultures, we are currently undertaking further experiments employing antibodies which mark different stages of oligodendroglial differentiation.",

            "text": "If the two subtypes of oligodendrocytes differ in their stages of maturation then one may speculate that their differential infection by CDV is due to a \"window\" of susceptibility. A similar virus-cell interaction has been reported with the murine JHM coronavirus, which, in vitro, will infect only immature rat oligodendrocytes (Beushausen and Dales, 1985) . It remains to be established whether these in vitro experiments can be extrapolated to canine oligodendrocyte infection in vivo, which has infrequently been documented (Blakemore et al., 1989; Raine, 1976) . Mature oligodendrocytes in the CNS may be relatively resistent to infection. In the course of these experiments we did not observe the degeneration and necrosis of multipolar oligodendrocytes in the infected cultures as was reported (Vandevelde et al., 1985; Zurbriggen et al., 1986, 198?b,c) and which occurred despite the lack of infection of these cells. In our cerebral and cerebellar cultures, GC + oligodendrocytes comprised only a minor component of the cell populations in contrast to the large numbers of MAG+ oligodendrocytes reported in the studies of Vandevelde and Zurbriggen. It is possible that our failure to observe oligodendrocyte degeneration may be due to the study of different subsets of oligodendrocytes: those identified by MAG largely in immunoperoxidase procedures (Zurbriggen et al., 1986 (Zurbriggen et al., , 1987a compared to those labeled by GC in our immunofluorescent studies.",
