In our case series, cardiac syncope with tachy- or brady-arrhythmia as the primary cause has been excluded, since all patients had a PPM or an ICD showing no abnormalities. Syncope due to structural cardiac disease or pulmonary embolism has been ruled out as well. The proposed pathophysiological explanation might be a neurally mediated/reflex mechanism in its non-classical form (absence of certain trigger) or an autonomic dysfunction, either primary or secondary. There are two main pathophysiological mechanisms in reflex syncope, both of them depending from an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity: vasodepression, caused by insufficient sympathetic vasoconstriction, and cardioinhibition, caused by parasympathetic predominance. This type of imbalance might find another confirming factor in the association between COVID-19 infection and \u201cinappropriate\u201d sinus tachycardia which often characterizes patients with Coronavirus infection even in the absence of respiratory failure.3\n",

The occurrence of neurologic features in COVID-19 infection has been recently documented, in terms of encephalopathy and corticospinal tract involvement.4, 5 However, determining if this is a direct effect of the virus or if it is due to a critical autoimmune reaction or inflammation caused by cytokines is still a matter of debate. Cytokine storm with subsequent hyper-inflammation is one of the proposed mechanisms of COVID-19 serious illness.6 Vascular injury caused by IL-1 and IL-6 and decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting in vasodilation could be one of the possible explanations of syncope as the resulting symptom.7\n",
