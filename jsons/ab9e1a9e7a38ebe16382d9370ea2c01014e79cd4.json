It will be important for all people, especially older adults, to take precautions to avoid infection. The strength of this study is that our method did not require estimation of the prevalence of infection or case fatality ratios (since there is no consensus about these values yet). It should be emphasized that the tabulated mortality rates are not infection fatality rates (fractions of infected people who die). Rather, the listed mortality rates are the fraction of the entire population who died.",

As schools have been closed during the pandemic, the exposure of children to the virus, even in New York, was in all likelihood less than that of the other groups studied (MTA workers, Diamond Princess passengers). Presumably, if schools reopen, the mortality among children will increase. Still, it is likely that the mortality among children will remain several orders of magnitude below that of older adults.",

One New York MTA worker in his late 30s died of coronavirus. A second New York transit worker in his mid-30s died of coronavirus, though technically he was not an MTA employee, and therefore, did not factor in our analysis. 2 The New York state data confirms that these deaths of workers in their 30s were not unprecedented. It would be useful if localities (and national authorities) could release coronavirus demographic data broken down with more granularity. For instance, colleges would be most interested in the data from age 18-22 years. This was the first study of the mortality among New York transit workers, to our knowledge. Analysis of this group helps to characterize the mortality among older working age adults. The first confirmed case of coronavirus infection in New York City was reported on March 1, 2020. 25 The MTA workers were forbidden to wear masks and gloves until March 8. 26, 27 On March 26, two MTA workers died from coronavirusthe first MTA workers to suffer this fate. 28 An announcement that the MTA would provide the workers with masks on came on March 27. 29 On April 4, 2020, the MTA was able to obtain 250,000 N95 masks for the workers. 30 On April 15, the governor of New York announced an order to require that after a 3-day notification period, the public would be required to wear masks when unable to socially distance, such as on public transit. 31 Therefore, there was a delay of 5 weeks between presence of the infection in the city and the MTA obtaining masks, and of 7 weeks until the public was required to wear masks when in transit.",

The sole fatality on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, on which a coronavirus outbreak occurred, was a 41year-old sailor. 32 In highly-exposed populations, the fraction of the population infected has been less than 100%. On some ships with outbreaks, all on board were tested. On the USS Theodore Roosevelt, 856 of 4845 sailors (17.7%) tested positive for the virus. 32 On the Diamond Princess, 619 of 3,711 passengers (16.7%) tested positive for coronavirus, only half of whom were symptomatic. 1 Among New York MTA workers, a group which was not universally tested, over 6000 workers (8%) have either tested positive (over 2000), or entered quarantine (4000 workers). 33 In these populations, it is not known if those who tested negative were false negatives, were tested at the wrong time, had less exposure than their fellow passengers or workers, or were less susceptible to infection.",
