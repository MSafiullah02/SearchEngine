The essence of mathematical modelling lies in writing down a set of mathematical equations that mimic reality. These are then solved for certain values of the parameters within the equations. The solutions of the mathematical model can be refined when we use information that we already know about the virus spread, for example, available data on reported number of infections, the reported number of hospitalisations or the confirmed number of deaths due to the infection. This process of model refinement (or calibration) can be done a number of times until the solutions of the mathematical equations agree with what we already know about the virus spread. The calibrated model, can then be used to tell us more about future behavior of the virus spread. One outcome of mathematical models is the predicted epidemic curve representing the number of infections caused by the virus over time. Using different parameters in the model, which may illustrate different interventions, or calibrating the model against different data, can change the predicted epidemic curve.",

            "text": "Since COVID-19 transmission started in late January, mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of shaping the decisions around different non-pharmaceutical interventions to confine its\u2019 spread in the UK. One model in particular, developed by Neil Ferguson\u2019s group at Imperial College London [1] has been widely quoted as the driving force behind the social-distancing measures implemented in the UK and worldwide in order to halt COVID-19 spread. As a mathematical modeller with vast experience in developing, parametrising, calibrating and using models to answer different policy questions, I have been excited with the power that this mathematical model has had. But at the same time, knowing that mathematical modeling is designed to simplify reality and answer specific questions using relevant subsets of data, I had wondered how robust this mathematical model is, especially when the dataset they have used is only days, possibly a couple of months, long. \u201cA mathematical model is as good as the data it uses\u201d is a common sentence used among mathematical modellers. This had definitely come to mind a number of times with the Imperial model suggesting that \u201c \u2026 optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths \u2026 \u201d And especially when the model predictions that 500,000 people may die from severe COVID-19 infections using a value of R0= 2.4 in the model with no interventions, had to be drastically revised to a possible 20,000 people dying from severe infection, and an increased R0 to be closer to 3 reported recently [2, 3].",

Ferguson et al. model [1] is a stochastic individual based model (IBM) that considers the infectiousness of each individual within the population as a function of the number of contacts within the household, work/study place and random contacts. In contrast, Gupta et al. model [5] is a classic deterministic \u201csusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)\u201d model that averages the infectiousness across the population. Both types of models have been used historically across different infectious diseases [6] and both have advantages and disadvantages, with the modelling approach chosen often based on the preference of the modeller. Under exactly the same conditions, i.e. same datasets, same parameters, using same numerical software for simulations, they ought to converge to one another. They may not, as is the case for the Imperial and Oxford models, when they use different data.",

In addition, the two critical parameters for COVID-19 spread that we have been hearing so much about: R0 and CFR are different in the two models. R0 is the basic reproduction number quantifying the number of secondary infections emerging from a primary infection and characterising the transmissibility of the virus [7]. CFR is the case fatality rate or ratio describing the death rate from COVID-19 due to infection and is a measure for the infection-severity or fatality of the virus [7]. The Imperial model has used a mean value of R0 =2.4 to derive their initial conclusions, but revised it to closer to 3 [2] in the last couple of days. Instead of CFR, they used infection fatality rate (IFR) that applies to a disease outbreak, and is closely related to CFR, but includes asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases. The mean IFR value used in the Imperial model is 0.9% with a range between 0.002% in 0\u20139 years old and 9.3% in over 80 years old. The Oxford model, on the other hand uses a mean R0 value of either 2.25 or 2.75 for different scenarios and a mean CFR value of 0.14%. Using different values for infectiousness (R0) and fatality (CFR) of COVID-19 will inevitably generate different results.",

Hence I suggest, that instead of comparing the two models, we ought to view these as parts of a puzzle that needs to be built to give the full picture of how best to tackle COVID-19 spread. Taking a more interpretational view of the conclusions of the two models, we may say that the Imperial model suggests that suppression interventions are key to \u201cflattening the epidemic curve\u201d. The Oxford model, on the other hand, suggests that since a large proportion of the population may have already had it, it is important to undertake a large-scale antibody testing of the population as soon as possible. But aren\u2019t both of these conclusions relevant? May it be that large-blanket anti-body testing within the current mitigating strategy is the way forward? This will be important as we start to question whether the reported symptomatic cases are forming the majority of COVID-19 cases or whether there are there additional under-reported asymptomatic cases. In previous pandemics such as SARS, the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people after infection was quite low, making it easier to contact trace the infected cases and isolate them. We don\u2019t yet have enough information as to whether this is the case with COVID-19. So will the \u201cflattened epidemic curve\u201d rise again once we come out of the quarantine adopted worldwide? Let's build a model and answer this!",
