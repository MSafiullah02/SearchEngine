The respiratory mucosa is the primary site for invasion and entry into the body of a large number of pathogens, including many viruses. Infection of the respiratory tissues is normally initiated in the upper respiratory tract (URT), and this is also the site where viruses come into contact with the immune system. Viruses such as the rhinoviruses (common cold viruses), most adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses are limited to infection of the URT, where they cause generally self\u2010limiting common cold\u2010like illnesses, however the viruses which cause the greatest burden in terms of severe respiratory disease in humans are those which are capable of penetrating the initial defenses in the URT, to infect the deeper respiratory airways. The most important of these are influenza (flu) virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI\u20103V), and the destruction which they cause to cells and tissues in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) results in severe respiratory disease with symptoms such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and often pneumonia, leading in some instances to death. These viruses are therefore a prime target for the development of more effective vaccines. In this review, research in the area of nanoparticle vaccines for control of respiratory virus infection, in particular, control of influenza virus, RSV, and PI\u20103V, will be discussed.",

Most RSV infections result in only mild\u2013moderate clinical signs, however a minority of children (0.5\u20132%) require hospital treatment for severe RSV bronchiolitis.1 RSV infection of the LRT can be complicated and enhanced by the host immune response, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. An effective vaccine for use in children and older adults is highly desirable, however previous experience with RSV vaccines and the complexity of the immune response has made the progress difficult.1, 2 A virus closely related to human RSV also infects cattle, causing a disease particularly in young calves which resembles the disease in human infants, and these features make bovine RSV infection in calves a useful model for the study of human RSV. Both viruses are also closely related antigenically.3 PI\u20103V also causes severe respiratory disease, especially in infants and young children, and in importance is second only to RSV.

Together, these structures constitute Waldeyer's ring and are known as the nasal\u2010associated lymphoid tissues (NALT). Efferent lymphatics drain from NALT into the superficial cervical lymph nodes of the upper thorax, and these in turn are drained by the posterior cervical lymph nodes. However no afferent lymphatics are present. NALT also contains aggregates of lymphoid follicles (B\u2010cell areas), interfollicular areas (T\u2010cell areas), macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs).4 By contrast, the lymphoid tissue in the LRT (bronchus\u2010associated lymphoid tissue, or BALT) is less well\u2010organized and defined. Before stimulation, BALT consists of undifferentiated lymphocytes and macrophages in a loose stromal network,5 covered by a specialized \u2018lymphoepithelium,\u2019 but devoid of the goblet cells and cilia which are characteristic of the epithelium on the adjoining respiratory mucosa. The lymphoepithelium contains specialized cells, similar to the \u2018M\u2019 or microfold cells in Peyer's patches, which function to sample the contents of the lumen of the airway. Following stimulation, the complexity and organization of the BALT aggregates increases, and they adopt a \u2018dome\u2019 shape, bulging slightly into the lumen of the airway beneath the epithelium.5\n",

            "text": "Primary virus infection and replication takes place in the ciliated columnar cells lining the URT, and then spreads to the LRT, largely by aspiration of virus\u2010containing secretions into the trachea. With RSV, there may also be some spread of infection by direct cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread, but the major mechanism is by breathing in of virus\u2010rich secretions and infected cell debris.6 Studies with isolated airway epithelial cells in culture have provided much information on the mechanisms of viral targeting and spread in the respiratory tract.7, 8 Influenza A, RSV, and PI\u20103V all have a particular tropism for the ciliated columnar respiratory epithelial cells which line the lumen of the airway, and infection is largely limited to these cells. These cells are polarized, having distinct apical (outward, facing the lumen) and basolateral (inward facing) surfaces and virus release by budding takes place predominantly from the apical surface into the lumen. This polarization of virus budding favors restriction of the infection to the epithelial cell layer, and facilitates infection of adjacent ciliated epithelial cells, as well as inhalation of virus to the lower airways.9 The cilia themselves may be directly necessary for RSV infection possibly as a site of virus attachment.7 Following infection, cilial beat in RSV\u2010infected cells was significantly inhibited within 2 h, and a loss of cilia from the epithelial surface occurred from 24 h. By 3\u20135 days all ciliated cells had been infected and killed by the virus.7 This is supported by experimental studies with bovine RSV in calves which showed that replication of the virus started in the URT, and then progressed down the respiratory tract, to affect most of the ciliated cells.10 Cells in the BALT and regional lymph nodes did not appear to replicate the virus and likewise replication was not observed in the palatine tonsils although virus\u2010positive cells were seen in the epithelial cells covering the pharyngeal tonsils. No virus antigen was observed in the lymphoid cells underlying the epithelium. In the alveoli, both type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes contained large amounts of RSV antigen.10\n",

            "text": "Since most respiratory tract infections are initiated in the URT, it seems logical that the NALT should act as the first site of antigen recognition. There is also strong evidence that it is an important inductive site for immune responses which operate to clear infection from the URT. The mucociliary system in the URT quickly removes particulate antigens from the mucosa to the exterior. If particles are successful in adhering to the epithelium, they may be taken up by the microfold (M) cells present in the epithelium overlying the NALT. The basolateral surface of the M cell is folded and invaginated to give pockets in which lymphocytes and macrophages can be identified. Long cytoplasmic processes extend from this surface into the sub\u2010epithelial tissues where they form associations with other lymphoid cells including antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs).4, 11 Exogenous antigen which has been phagocytosed at the lumenal surface is transported to the basolateral pocket where it is released. Smaller soluble antigens are taken up by the nasal epithelium and drain directly by means of the efferent lymphatics to the lymph nodes. Uptake of viral antigens and particles by macrophages and (DCs) in the area of the pockets, results in priming of IgA precursors which leave the NALT and enter the cervical lymph nodes where they are amplified and differentiated into immunoglobulin (mostly IgA, but also IgG)\u2010producing cells. These migrate by means of the bloodstream, to mucosal effector sites and to the respiratory mucosa, where the IgA is actively transported to the mucosal surface.12, 13, 14, 15 This is an important mechanism through which infection at the mucosal surface results in systemic (serum IgG) and mucosal (IgA) antibody responses. Primed T and B cells also migrate from the lymph nodes to effector sites in the respiratory tract and elsewhere, where they provide long\u2010term B\u2010 and T\u2010cell memory, with the option to differentiate into antibody\u2010producing cells at short notice if required. Virus infection or vaccination of the respiratory mucosa also results in generation of anti\u2010viral cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocytes (CTL). It has been shown that NALT is a potent inductive site for virus\u2010specific CTLs following intranasal infection.16 The induction of a strong anti\u2010viral CTL response is a major goal for vaccination of the URT, in addition to induction of virus\u2010specific IgA. Mucosal responses in the LRT are induced in the BALT by similar mechanisms.",

            "text": "Given the nature of these viruses, and particularly the fact that reinfections even in the presence of antibody are common (particularly with RSV and PI\u20103V), the objective of preventing infection by vaccination is probably unachievable. A more realistic goal is to prevent the development of severe disease. Since this is associated with infection of the LRT, this effectively means that the vaccine should be aimed at ensuring that the infection is limited to the URT, and should prevent the virus from spreading to the deeper airways. Hospitalization rates for individuals with RSV and PI\u20103V bronchiolitis are greatest in children under 2 months of age. Therefore new generation vaccines for these agents will be required to be effective in very young infants, since this is the age group most at risk from severe respiratory disease. This presents major problems in vaccine design due to the presence of maternal antibodies in humans and animals. In addition to the problem of virus\u2010specific antibodies combining with and removing the vaccine virus, the immaturity of the immune system in the young infant results in a relatively poor antibody response to immunization. Also, presence of maternal antibodies in the first few months of life has a profound inhibitory effect on responses to vaccines,17 although the exact mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Encapsulation of viral proteins within nanoparticles has obvious attractions for vaccination in the presence of maternally derived, anti\u2010viral antibodies, since the vaccine antigen is not exposed and therefore unavailable for interaction with specific antibodies.",

            "text": "There is currently substantial interest in the exploitation of nanoparticle technology for drug and vaccine delivery. Nanoparticles are solid particles ranging in size from 10 to 1000 nm. The antigen payload is dissolved, entrapped, adsorbed, attached, or encapsulated into the matrix of the particle. The use of biodegradable materials allows for release of the antigen as the particle degrades over a period which may vary from days to weeks depending on the formulation. Several types of nanoparticle for vaccine delivery have been investigated and have proved suitable for loading with antigens. These include the polyesters [poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), and their copolymers], polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, and polycarbonates.18 They can protect the antigen from degradation in vivo and the particles can be prepared in a chemically reproducible manner within narrow size limits.18 Some biopolymers exhibit natural adjuvant behavior. Poly (lactide co\u2010glycolide) (PLGA) has been extensively studied as a biopolymer suitable for vaccine delivery and appears to activate DC maturation possibly by providing a necessary danger signal, however the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated.19, 20 Surface modifications can be achieved either by coating with stabilizers, other polymers, or surfactants. The purpose is to change the overall charge, and the hydrophobicity of the particle and improve muco\u2010adherence properties.21 Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been used as a nanoparticle coating for its stabilizing properties and can have the effect of enhancing the affinity of the particles for mucosal surfaces. In addition, molecular danger signals have been conjugated to the surface of particles often through linkages to PEG.18 Nanoparticles coated with mannose (mannan) have been produced with the aim of targeting mannose receptors on APCs and thus improving cell adhesion and uptake.22 Other types of targeting molecules have also been added (e.g., lectins) and these can increase interaction and transport across the mucosal surface.21 Enhanced targeting of particles has also been achieved by conjugation of particles with monoclonal antibodies specific for markers on the membrane of the DC.23 In addition, hydrophilic polymers, such as chitosan, have been investigated for vaccine delivery.24 Chitosan also has the property of being able to adhere to mucosal surfaces, and is reported to be able to open the tight junctions between epithelial cells, thus facilitating the transport of encapsulated macromolecules across epithelia.25 Chitosan particles also have the capacity to be loaded with large amounts of protein antigen. Cross linking of chitosan with polyanions such as tripolyphosphate (TPP) has allowed production of nontoxic particles with homogeneous and adjustable size and a positive charge which can be easily modulated, as well as a capacity for binding of peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids.26\n",

            "text": "Understanding of the mechanisms of particle uptake and antigen processing are essential for nanoparticle vaccine design. Penetration of particles across the nasal epithelium has been shown to depend on a number of factors including dose, formulation, frequency of administration, and size of the particles.25 Application of the particle in liquid suspension, in aerosol or as powder results in relatively rapid clearance by means of the mucociliary clearance mechanisms operating in the nasal cavity and this may happen relatively quickly, so that most of the particles and their antigen payload are lost. To enhance the contact time with the epithelium, it may be possible to enhance the bioadhesive properties of the particles, and this can result in slower clearance with enhanced capability for absorption to and penetration of the epithelium. Some groups have explored the properties of chitosan particles with this objective in mind.25 The particles which adhere to the epithelium can be taken up by the M cells which overly the NALT, and transported to the basolateral surface where interaction with macrophages and lymphocytes takes place.25 DCs are the most effective APCs and have a central role in initiating T cell\u2010mediated immunity. As such they are crucially important as targets for new vaccines and adjuvants. Targeting of DCs in vivo is difficult because in mucosal tissues they are present in lower numbers than other APCs, such as macrophages. In studies aimed at improving targeting of nanoparticles to DCs, Kwon et al.\n23 were able to conjugate a monoclonal antibody, specific for an endocytosis receptor on DCs (DEC\u2010205), to acid\u2010degradable nanoparticles. The particles were designed to be taken up by receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis in vivo, and were acid\u2010labile, so that they were hydrolyzed rapidly in the acid environment of the lysosome. The encapsulated antigen (ovalbumin) was then released into the cytoplasm, where it was degraded and processed by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I intracellular route. Enhanced, DC\u2010specific endocytosis of the particles was demonstrated in these studies.23 Uptake of particles into DCs has been shown to depend on the size, surface charge, and type of particle coating as well as the type of cell. The mechanism by which particles are internalized by the DC is important in deciding how the antigen is subsequently processed and presented.35 Virus\u2010sized particles (20\u2013200 nm) are usually taken up by classical receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis (clathrin\u2010dependent), through clathrin\u2010coated pits in the membrane. Endocytosis of larger particles (>500 nm) occurs mainly by macropinocytosis and phagocytosis.18, 35, 36 Cationic nanoparticles are particularly effective for uptake into macrophages and DCs. The positively charged particles are strongly attracted to the negatively charged DC membrane, which facilitates binding and subsequent internalization.36 The particles are internalized into endosomes in the DCs which fuse with the lysosomes, in which the particles are degraded enzymatically. This extracellular uptake followed by controlled degradation in endosomes, facilitates the assembly of antigen fragments into peptide\u2010MHC class II complexes, and ultimate activation of CD4 + T cells.18 DCs were originally thought to process only endogenously produced proteins through the MHC class I pathway, however it is now clear that peptides from foreign antigens can also be presented on MHC class I antigens.36, 37 This process of loading exogenous peptides onto MHC class I antigens is known as cross presentation, and involves transfer of degraded proteins at one of several stages to the MHC class I pathway.36 Antigens encapsulated in nanoparticles have been shown to elicit strong CTL responses,38, 39, 40, 41 which demonstrate their ability to access the cross\u2010presentation pathway to MHC class I presentation, following macropinocytosis of the particles and endosomal processing. This is important in the context of respiratory tract vaccination in order to ensure rapid clearance, should subsequent virus infection take place.",

IgA antibody\u2010forming cells were observed to accumulate in the cervical lymph node and nasal mucosa, accompanied by the appearance of virus\u2010specific IgA antibodies in nasal secretions.

Lemoine and Preat49 produced PLGA nanoparticles of approximately 200 nm and were able to show that the hemagglutinin retained its antigenicity following encapsulation. Vaccination studies in mice with larger PLGA particles (2.2\u201310.8 \u00b5m) have also been carried out.50 The particles were inoculated orally into mice and were shown to induce both systemic and mucosal responses which were protective against intranasal challenge with H3N2 influenza virus. The levels of IgA antibody in saliva were higher following oral compared to systemic administration; however, IgG levels in serum were comparable.50 By contrast, Hilbert et al.\n51 using smaller influenza PLGA particles with an average diameter of 35 \u00b5m, found that the immune response in mice was significantly greater following systemic administration. A single subcutaneous immunization of encapsulated influenza hemagglutinin stimulated a more effective response than the conventional vaccine. In this study, inoculation of the influenza particles together with hemagglutinin in soluble (fluid) form, resulted in the highest antibody titers, possibly indicating that the adjuvant properties of the particles were enhanced when a priming dose of soluble antigen was also present at the injection site. Using the influenza virus matrix protein as a candidate antigen it was shown that processing and presentation of proteins through MHC class I and class II pathways are more efficient when the proteins are presented to DCs in PLGA nanospheres.53 It was thought that the efficient processing of the matrix protein through MHC class I may have been due to enhanced escape of the protein from the lysosome when processed in PLGA particles. This is consistent with other studies which show that encapsulation of antigens in PLGA particles increased the efficiency of presentation in DCs by up to 100\u2010fold, compared with soluble antigen.52 These results indicated that rather than acting as a slow release depot, PLGA particles gave rise to more effective antigen processing and presentation by the DCs.

In the 1960s, a formalin\u2010inactivated, alum\u2010precipitated human RSV vaccine (FI\u2010HRSV) was evaluated in young children and infants. Despite eliciting moderately high levels of virus\u2010specific serum antibody, the vaccine did not confer resistance to infection and when recipients were subsequently naturally infected with RSV, several children developed RSV disease with enhanced severity compared to their unvaccinated peers and two children died.54, 55 The phenomenon of disease enhancement by vaccination resulted in the abandonment of the FI\u2010HRSV vaccine; but despite almost 40 years of intensive research, there is still no commercially available human RSV vaccine. The currently approved bovine vaccines for RSV are also administered parenterally, and several studies suggest that as in humans, bovine RSV vaccination can predispose the animals to a disease with increased severity, following subsequent field challenge.56, 57, 58 There is also evidence that the protection afforded by these vaccines is generally short lived and that the efficacy is substantially reduced in the presence of maternal antibodies.59 Even when levels of virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies are high, protection against infection is not complete and reinfections are common. Systemic antibody, however, does appear to be effective in reducing the severity of subsequent infections, and in most cases probably limits infection to the URT, although this probably also depends on the relative virulence of the infecting virus.1 As with influenza, cellular immunity also appears to be important in clearing RSV from the respiratory tract, and this has been demonstrated largely in animal models.10 Therefore there is a great need for new generation vaccines which can be used in the presence of maternal antibodies, and which can induce more durable protection without the predisposing effect of the currently available vaccines. Because of these problems, RSV subunit vaccines have been investigated, and in these studies, immunogenic peptides from the F and G proteins of the virus have been shown to be important in immunity and protection against RSV disease.60, 61 The peptides were produced in the laboratory, coupled to a carrier protein (ovalbumin) and encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles to investigate immunogenicity in mice. In these experiments, mice were immunized intranasally with the RSV nanoparticle vaccine, boosted 5 weeks later, and antibody levels and lympho\u2010proliferation in spleen cell suspensions measured 3 weeks after the booster inoculation. High levels of peptide\u2010specific IgA were demonstrated in nasal and lung washings and strong peptide\u2010specific proliferation responses were also recorded in spleen suspensions, indicating that migration of primed T cells had taken place from the site of mucosal stimulation in the URT to the spleen (Kavanagh and Adair, unpublished). Chitosan nanoparticles have also been used to deliver RSV short interfering (si) RNA, which was protective against RSV challenge in rats.62, 63 The Th2\u2010type immunity which is induced following RSV infection is thought to be due at least in part to inhibition of interferon\u2010alpha by the NS1 protein of the virus. Blocking of NS1 synthesis shifts the balance of the immune response toward Th1, and therefore more effective viral clearance.63 This was achieved by intranasal immunization of rats with chitosan nanoparticles, composed of chitosan complexed with plasmids containing RSV NS1 siRNA sequences. This treatment was effective in reducing RSV titres in the lung tissue, following challenge, and in reducing RSV\u2010induced pneumonitis.62, 63 This study demonstrated that RNA interference has a substantial future as a new and effective vaccine strategy for silencing viral genes, particularly those involved in disease pathogenesis and that nanoparticles are an effective means of delivering siRNA sequences.",

This is crucially important particularly with RSV vaccines, where a Th2\u2010type immune response is thought to contribute to the severity of RSV\u2010induced disease.3, 64 Mottram et al.\n43 using 49 nm polystyrene nanobeads conjugated with RSV (G88) protein were able to generate strong systemic Th1 immunity in mice which protected against RSV challenge. Therefore using nanoparticles of the correct size it may be possible to design RSV vaccines that avoid unwanted Th2 immunity and the risk of predisposition and consequent enhanced RSV\u2010immunopathology.",

Antibody responses were undetectable following intranasal inoculation, and low following intraperitoneal administration, however challenge infection showed that virus titers were reduced by 10\u2010 to15\u2010fold in the vaccinates, compared to the controls. Intraperitoneal administration resulted in reasonable levels of virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies in serum and saliva, and the animals were completely protected against PI\u20103V challenge.65 PI\u20103V PLGA nanoparticles with an average diameter of 422 nm were also shown to induce high levels of virus\u2010specific antibodies in serum, following intranasal immunization of mice.66 After a single intranasal dose of the vaccine, all of the vaccinated mice developed PI\u20103V neutralizing antibodies, which increased in titre following intranasal boosting. Immunoblotting demonstrated that antibodies were produced to all the major virus proteins.
