            "text": "On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan on 31 December 2019, a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d\u2014an alarm it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries and which requires a coordinated international response. Previous studies have confirmed that this virus can spread from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to healthcare workers.\n1\n, \n2\n As of 3 February 2020, there have been 20 438 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV confirmed in mainland China, including 2788 serious, 425 deaths, and 632 discharged, as well as 15 in Hong Kong, 8 in Macao, and 10 in Taiwan. More than 150 cases had also been confirmed in at least 18 other countries on four continents. In epidemiological studies, the basic reproductive number (R\n0) is defined as the possible number of infection cases generated from a single infected person at a particular time point during an outbreak and is often used to describe transmission dynamics over the course of a disease epidemic. On the basis of earlier research, the initial R\n0 was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9) among the first 425 patients with 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010induced pneumonia,\n2\n consistent with the preliminary estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 presented by the WHO during their International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting on the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak. It is possible that subsequent control measures, such as the strict travel restrictions in Wuhan and China as well as overseas, may change or reduce the R\n0 value over the course of the virus outbreak. Of note, the coronaviridae family not only includes 2019\u2010nCoV, but also severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), and the common cold viruses in immunocompetent individuals (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1).\n3\n The SARS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2002\u20102003 outbreak of SARS in Guangdong Province, China, which resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries worldwide.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n The MERS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2012 outbreak of MERS, which resulted in 2494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries worldwide.\n7\n, \n8\n Notably, both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are zoonotic in origin, with prior studies revealing bats to be the animal host source,\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n and masked palm civets\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n and camels\n16\n, \n17\n to be the intermediate animal hosts (between bats and humans) of the two diseases, respectively. Recent research has also reported that the 2019\u2010nCoV virus is 96% identical at the genome level to a previously detected bat coronavirus, which belongs to a SARS\u2010related coronavirus species (ie, SARS\u2010CoV).\n18\n Like SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and many other coronaviruses, 2019\u2010nCoV likely originated in bats, but it remains unclear whether an intermediary animal host was involved before the virus jumped to humans. As reported in earlier research, however, although bats could be the original host of 2019\u2010nCoV, the virus may have initially been transmitted to an intermediate animal host sold at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thus facilitating the emergence of 2019\u2010nCoV in humans.\n19\n\n",

The PHI test of \u201cdataset_32\u201d did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination (P = 1.0). Likelihood\u2010mapping analysis of \u201cdataset_14\u201d revealed that 100% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star\u2010like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Figure 1A). Likewise, 91.9%, 81.8%, and 74.7% of the quartets from \u201cdataset_24,\u201d \u201cdataset_30,\u201d and \u201cdataset_32,\u201d respectively, were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating relatively more phylogenetic signals as additional sequences were analyzed over time (Figure 1B\u2010D). ML phylogenetic analysis of the four datasets also showed star\u2010like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood\u2010mapping results (Figure 2). Root\u2010to\u2010tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best\u2010fitting root showed that \u201cdataset_14\u201d had a relatively strong positive temporal signal (R\n2 = .2967; correlation coefficient = .5446) (Figure 3A).

We also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site.

Of note, the strong star\u2010like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from \u201cdataset_14\u201d at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019\u2010nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_14\u201d (Figure 2A). The genetic divergence from \u201cdataset_32\u201d and \u201cdataset_30\u201d was higher than that for \u201cdataset_14,\u201d but still demonstrated minor temporal signals (Figure 3). Using the constrained evolutionary rate method, the mean TMRCA dates for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the four datasets ranged from 15 October to 10 November 2019, when using a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20104 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter (Table 1). This is considered reasonable given the limited genetic divergence and strong star\u2010like signals and is also consistent with our previous study.\n36\n Using the tip\u2010dating method, the mean TMRCA date and evolutionary rate for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the \u201cdataset_30\u201d and \u201cdataset_32\u201d ranged from 16 November to 22 December 2019 and from 1.7926 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.8266 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year, respectively (Table 1). The TMRCA estimated by the tip\u2010dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained evolutionary rate method. We identified three phylogenetic clusters with posterior probabilities between .99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figures 4 and 5). We also identified three transmission clusters when the genetic distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site (Figure 6). Intriguingly, only one cluster (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020 from Zhuhai) was identified by both phylogenetic and network\u2010based methods. This is a good example showing the differences between phylogenetic (posterior probability or bootstrap value) and network\u2010based (genetic distance) methods. However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of 2019\u2010nCOV genome sequences presented in this study.",

The genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV have already led to diagnostic tests, as well as efforts to study its dispersal and evolution. As the outbreak continues, we will require multiple genome sequences of samples over the course of the outbreak and from different locations to determine how the virus evolves. We also need to gain a better understanding of the virus's biology, especially compared to findings from previous studies on the SARS and MERS viruses. For instance, 2019\u2010nCoV can kill cultured human cells, entering them via the same molecular receptor as SARS\u2010CoV.\n18\n Therefore, it is essential that we isolate, share, and study virus samples, both in China and elsewhere, to identify animals that exhibit similar infection to humans for drug and vaccine testing, to better understand virus transmission (eg, airborne or close contact), and to develop blood tests for viral antibodies. Currently, 2019\u2010nCoV has primarily caused severe illness and death in older people, particularly those with pre\u2010existing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Although this virus does not typically infect or kill young and healthy individuals, a 36\u2010year\u2010old Wuhan man with no known pre\u2010existing health conditions has been the youngest victim reported so far. In situations where a virus jumps from one animal host to another species\u2014which is probably how this coronavirus initially infected humans\u2014most mutations are detrimental to or have no effect on the virus, and selection pressure may improve survival in the new host. Therefore, we predict that one or more mutations may be selected and sustained during the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak as the virus adapts to human hosts and possibly reduces its virulence, as reported in the previous study.\n37\n However, we are uncertain whether this will influence its transmissibility.",
