CRFK are utilised for the growth of certain feline vaccinal viruses (Lappin et al., 2005). Proteins derived from CRFK cells have been suggested to persist in vaccines, and there is some evidence of an association between vaccination and the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats, possibly due to the development of antibodies against CRFK cell antigens (Finch et al., 2016; Lappin et al., 2005; Whittemore et al., 2010). CRFK have also been utilised as an in vitro model for the study of profibrotic factors on the feline tubular epithelium (van Beusekom and Zimmering, 2018).",

CRFK were originally described as epithelial based upon morphology, presumably indicating a tubular epithelial derivation (Crandell et al., 1973).

CRFK also expressed two cell adhesion molecules, CD29 and CD44, associated with feline fibroblasts (Lawson et al., 2018b; Mumaw et al., 2015). There was no expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, which labels feline distal tubular/collecting duct cells in situ, and FPTEC in vitro (Bland et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2018a). Furthermore, CRFK did not demonstrate expression of the brush border enzymes ALP or GGT, which are present in differentiated feline proximal tubular epithelial cells. CRFK were also negative for the myogenic IF desmin and the endothelial marker vWF, which labels interstitial capillaries in feline kidneys (Lawson et al., 2018a). Altogether, the expression profile of CRFK is identical to that of FCF (Lawson et al., 2018b), and is not suggestive of tubular epithelial, glomerular or endothelial origin.",

S100A4 expression has also been associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process by which epithelial cells dedifferentiate and gain mesenchymal characteristics (Okada et al., 1997). S100A4 expression was highly upregulated in CRFK cells, suggesting that CRFK may have originally been epithelial, but have undergone extensive phenotypic and genotypic drift after long-term culture, resulting in a form of neoplastic transformation enabling indefinite proliferation. There are, however, other possible explanations for the discrepancy in the reportedly original epithelial phenotype and the current mesenchymal phenotype. Original cultures were established with no attempt at cell selection, and it is possible that long-term culture selected for faster growing, fibroblastic cells, which overgrew the original epithelial cell population. It is also possible that contamination of the CRFK cell line has occurred at some point, as numerous cell lines have been found to be cross-contaminated with faster growing cell types (Buehring et al., 2004). Further information on the status of CRFK could be gained from DNA profiling or examining expression of additional marker proteins, but such work was beyond the scope of the current study.",

Both mouse IgG (G) and rabbit IgG (H) isotype controls were negative. CRFK cells did not demonstrate either ALP (L) or GGT (M) activity (FPTEC positive control inset). Greyscale photomicrographs were collected using a DMIRB inverted microscope with samples illuminated using an EBQ100 light source and an AxioCam ICm1 monochrome camera controlled through Axiovision software version 4.8.2. Immunofluorescence images were collected using a DM4000B upright microscope with samples illuminated using an EBQ100 light source and filter cubes A4 and L5 (all from Leica Microsystems) and an AxioCam MRm monochrome camera controlled through Axiovision software version 4.8.2 (Carl Zeiss Ltd). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Colour photomicrographs for the enzyme activity experiments were collected using an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and an Infinity 3-3UR colour camera (Lumenera, Ottawa, ON, Canada) controlled through Image Pro Insight software version 9.1.4 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
