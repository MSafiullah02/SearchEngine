Recently, the Lombardy region of northern Italy has reported massive infection, overwhelming the region's capacity to care for such patients. At present, there are over 700 intensive care patients in Lombardy, and over 1400 deaths in Italy attributed to this infection. As this infection is novel, there is no proven treatment for patients presently. The global tracking of spread suggests other countries are likely to have similar strains on their infrastructure in caring for these patients. China, where the SARS-CoV-2 originated, has slowed the progression of the pandemic with strict social distancing, while South Korea has similarly impeded spread with widespread testing. Europe and the United States appear poised for similar pandemics as Italy in the absence of significant societal or governmental interventions.",

Practicing physicians have previously not experienced massive triage based on resource limitations prior to this pandemic. These resource limitations have resulted in the creation of ethical guidelines on conserving resources at the expense of many human lives [2]. Clinicians have been overwhelmed and working beyond capacity. Many non-intensivist physicians have had to manage critically ill patients with limited expertise or guidance. Additionally, in the absence of proven therapies and overwhelming disease, many physicians have been attempting novel therapies in the hopes of mitigating the disease. Part of the reason for attempting these novel therapies is the realization that rigorous study of therapies will likely be too late to be of benefit for many people who will otherwise die. In the absence of clinical trials, bedside clinicians need an instrument to assess disease progression or improvement in patients with COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-19 is a betacoronavirus, as are SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronoviridae. Drugs such as lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, chloroquine, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, with controversial efficacy. The proteinase inhibitor lopinavir inhibits SARS coronavirus, and ritonavir inhibits metabolism of lopinavir, thus increasing its concentration [3]. The combination lopinavir/ritonavir is speculated as a possible therapy for COVID-19, as it has demonstrated some efficacy as a treatment for SARS. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have demonstrated in-vitro efficacy against COVID-19 by an as yet not fully understood mechanism [4,5]. Hydroxychloroquine might be preferred as it has fewer side effects than chloroquine, but have neither have yet demonstrated efficacy in infected patients. Similarly, remdesivir is a potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from MERS, and has also demonstrated in-vitro efficacy against COVID-19 [6,7]. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 inhibitor with a fairly good safety profile is being studied in China for treatment of COVID-19 [8]. At present, there are several trials underway in China to test these therapies [9], but the answers to such trials may be well after the SARS-CoV-2 virus has swept across the globe, killing millions.",

There is no clear benefit of these interventions, and recommendations are that investigational therapies should only be conducted in the setting of randomized trials or Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI). Our cohort is insufficiently powered to draw any useful inferences from these anti-COVID-19 drugs. We describe these interventions to offer insight of how physicians treated critically ill patients suffering from a disease with no proven therapies. However, the value of adhering to a severity scale was that interventions could be applied consistently between patients. We believe an instrument, even unvalidated, to guide adjunctive therapies is extremely import for future studies that will attempt to make inferences on those therapy. At present, the numbers are insufficient to make any inferences on the efficacy of therapy. However, as more data accrue, the adherence to a treatment algorithm will improve the quality of such inferences. The ventilator management in this cohort adhered to the WHO guidelines on low tidal volume ventilation and higher PEEP. However, the interim guideline advocates for prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS, and avoidance of routine neuromuscular blockade. Prone positioning was employed in only 10% of patients, and neuromuscular blockade was performed in over half. This practice is underscored by the proposed treatment schema from Brescia, which employed neuromuscular blockade prior to prone positioning.",

            "text": "The severity scale proposed by the authors has not been clinically validated, and likely will warrant further revision as this SARS-CoV-19 pandemic progresses. In future iterations, the authors would move prone positioning as a therapy earlier in the scale, and consider omitting corticosteroid therapies based on newer evidence and guideline recommendations from the WHO [10]. Other drug therapies, such as hydroxycholoroquine, may appear earlier in the treatment plan, as additional data develops. Additionally, the inclusion of non-invasive ventilation is a sub-optimal ventilation strategy for patients with COVID-19, but was chosen due to resource limitations [11]. Non-invasive ventilation may be obviated at other institutions with a surfeit of mechanical ventilators. However, clinicians believed this scale was useful for practicing clinicians to gauge clinical improvement or worsening of patients with SARS-CoV-19. Additionally, several patients in the study hospital were managed by non-intensivists out of necessity. These physicians needed guidance for management of patients and the creation of a scale allowed for consistent communication. We believe the value of the scale was to unify communication and management of such patients for intensivists working beyond their normal capacity. The scale also offered value in triage and assignment of resources, aspects of care that are foreign to most physicians. This scale may be of use in the United States, which appears to be on a trajectory for a comparable experience as Italy. While the United States has nearly three times the number of ICU beds per capita as Italy, the staffing limitations may require a two-tier model of physician management, as proposed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine [1]. In such a model, use of the BRCSS or a similar severity scale may augment communication between non-intensivist physicians and nurses. We would recommend intensivists in Europe and the Americas to consider creating or adapting a similar scale to address the anticipated need for simple and consistent communication with non-intensivist physicians and nurses.",
