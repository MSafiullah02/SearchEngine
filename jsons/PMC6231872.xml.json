It is estimated that 4.3 billion people globally will have mobile broadband subscriptions by the end of 2017 [2]. Their ubiquitous availability allows volunteer citizens to engage in disease detection through digital means [3]. Real-time granular health data are, thus, collected from volunteering participants (eg, via mobile phones with global positioning), supplementing the big data collected by public health authorities and laboratories [3,4]. Combining these different data sources allows earlier and finer spatial detection of public health threats than traditional surveillance systems, permitting more appropriate preventive and mitigating measures to be deployed [4]. A successful example of such disease digital detection is the European Influenzanet Consortium.",

            "text": "Every year in Europe, seasonal flu brings its share of morbidity and mortality among vulnerable groups (eg, the elderly) and a rise in associated medical costs [5]. Infection with influenza virus is hard to diagnose without virological confirmation, and public health authorities usually rely on influenza-like illness (ILI) as a surveillance indicator for outbreaks [6]. This surveillance program is carried out by the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN), which is coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Control [7]. Since 2008, EISN has relied on ILI reports by general practitioners from national sentinels in its 30 European Union and European Economic Area countries [8]. However, this traditional surveillance system is biased by the use of nonuniform case definitions for ILI by the Member States and depends on the rate at which patients seek medical care from general practitioners, thereby reflecting only medically attended ILI incidence rates [9-11]. The general practitioner consultation rate is itself dependent on several factors that include the time delay between the onset of symptoms and health complications, the need of certificates from general practitioners for prolonged work absenteeism owing to illness, types of health insurance, and health care systems [12]. Thus, there is a non negligible underestimation of the real disease burden of influenza outbreaks [13]. The current limitations of EISN led to the development of Influenzanet, an innovative ILI surveillance network based on the active participation of public volunteers and the use of Web-based technologies to report cases of ILI, complementing data gathered by EISN [12,14].",

Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have also joined this surveillance network [15]. However, very recently in 2017, the Netherlands-Belgium platforms have ceased their activities because of lack of funding, which undermines the excellent work done by these platforms in promoting the ILI surveillance for 15 years in their countries. The platforms will resume their activities if funding is made available by May 2018. Otherwise, the platforms will terminate their activities permanently [16]. Public volunteers are usually recruited via mass media, and there are no exclusion criteria for registration (except for Sweden) [17-19]. At registration, volunteers fill in an intake questionnaire and afterwards, receive a weekly reminder by email to fill in an ILI-related symptom questionnaire [6]. Importantly, the absence of symptoms is also declared. In addition, participants are allowed to indicate symptoms of ILI for other household members in an attempt to increase the data collection for children and elderly individuals [17].",

Moreover, some national platforms have developed mobile apps as additional data collection tools; for instance, the Swiss mobile app gathers useful supplementary data through smartphone sensors (eg, inbuilt movement sensors to test for an association between the physical activity level of participants and the risk of ILI) or smartphone features (eg, test for an association between the psychological profile of participants, inferred via the list of apps installed, and attitude toward vaccination; Grippenet Switzerland, email communication, November 29, 2017). This complements the data gathered from questionnaires, allowing to answer innovative research questions and implement rational public health strategies while maintaining high privacy protection measures; for example, only highly aggregated and summarized versions of the data are transmitted for analysis, whereas the bulk of data is stored locally on participants\u2019 smartphones. Moreover, mobile app data will not be shared with the rest of the Consortium until a framework for data sharing is set up. Nonetheless, Influenzanet data can be valuable and sensitive information.

Existing controversies can, thus, be the cause of additional barriers to efficient collaboration. Furthermore, although research collaboration and comparability of data are important because epidemics do not stop at national borders, varying ethical regulations at national levels can hamper collaboration between countries. Additionally, a number of new ethical issues raised by Influenzanet-like activities do not or only partially fit traditional evaluation categories used by Research Ethics Committees (RECs) for clinical trials or data-based research. This scoping review aims to discuss ELSIs of these participatory surveillance systems. First, we characterized the current practices using findings from the literature search where we compared how issues related to research ethics are being handled by different Influenzanet country groups to analyze similarities and identify the need for further harmonization of ethical approaches. Thereafter, we carried out an ELSI analysis to suggest ways to strengthen them to lay the ground for expanding the capacity and positive impact of such systems in the future.",

However, it is not known how national RECs judged and approved their respective studies; for instance, they could have considered the gathered personal health-related data from participants to be fully anonymized for which no informed consent is required or considered studies to be human subject research. In the latter case, RECs would need to evaluate if the balance between potential benefits and risks for study participants is favorable and ensure that participants received adequate information on these risks and benefits. Our comparative table shows that all country platforms where REC approvals had been sought obtained informed e-consents from participants; this seems to indicate that these national RECs consider this type of citizen participatory research as human subject research and that e-consent is considered a valid form of consent in this context. The regional REC in Geneva approved the implementation of the Swiss platform and the launch of its mobile app as a data collecting tool. Considered as human subject research in Switzerland, a reader friendly informed e-consent is requested from potential participants. Because we did not have access to additional REC evaluations, further studies are needed to determine how RECs from different countries debated the ethical issues. It is also well known that national RECs, as well as RECs within the same country, may assess and balance risk-benefit ratios differently. These divergences concerning the evaluation of similar Influenzanet projects in different countries could interfere with the harmonization of ethical approaches. Thus, we suggest more transparency in terms of ethical issues related to this type of technology-driven public health research. For instance, project leaders of national Influenzanet platforms could publish a summary of how RECs evaluated and debated the ethical issues of their respective studies (eg, if their studies fall under the category of human subject research and, thereby, need informed consent procedures, etc). Such transparency could help to harmonize the ethical approaches to be adopted by the country platforms even further.",

According to the Belgian and Dutch legislations, these are observational studies because no physical or psychological intervention is intended on participants [6,21,47]. Concerning Influmeter, the Danish platform is exempted from the REC approval for the following reasons: the Danish Data Protection Agency does not consider emails exchanged between study participants and Influmeter to be sensitive personal information; there is an automatic implicit consent from study participants because of its voluntary nature even if sensitive information is gathered (eg, health and coarse-grained geographical data); and the data manager of Influmeter, Statens Serum Institute that hosts a large proportion of Danish health data [48] received a broad permission from the Danish Data Protection Agency (record number: 2008-54-0474), which covers the surveillance of infectious diseases and identifiable sensitive information gathered by Influmeter (Influmeter, email communication, September 7, 2017) [20].",

However, it is difficult to verify whether these family members, in particular, are legally competent and could provide consent themselves, having expressed their will for their personal information to be recorded by the participating family member. It would be interesting to evaluate through future research whether RECs have considered this issue or have simply considered the data collected from other family members to be anonymous and, thus, not identifiable.",

It can be argued that there is an automatic implicit consent for Belgian and Dutch participants because registration to the study is voluntary. The Belgium-Dutch platforms [16] might consider providing an informed e-consent option to their participants in an attempt to harmonize consent practices across the Consortium if ever they resume their activities in the future. However, we noted that it is not clear whether informed consent was legally necessary in Belgium (\u201cLaw on experiments involving the human subject\u201d of May 2004) and the Netherlands because of the observational natures of their studies (De Grote Griepmeting, the Netherlands, email communication, January 10, 2018) [6,21,47]. Indeed, the Belgian and Dutch legislations acknowledge the need for informed consent for interventional studies because of the potential physical or psychological harm to participants [6,21,47], but the legislations do not clearly define how broad the category of observational studies is; for instance, a detailed questionnaire revealing some very personal information can be seen as an intervention in the Netherlands [49]. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the shift from typical physical or psychological harm seen in medical research to informational harm in public health research involving Web-based communities of volunteer citizens or big data (eg, data discrimination) with the latter having potential repercussions on the physical and mental states of study participants (eg, stigmatization and discrimination for health insurance coverage) [50,51].",

Although information on studies is available on their respective websites, participants usually have to look at different sections of the website to gather pertinent information on the study (eg, its goals, privacy policies, etc), which is tedious and unlikely to be read in detail. The Swiss legislation requires researchers to ensure that participants have understood all the information (provided in the written information form) through personal contact. According to the Ethics Guidelines for Internet-Mediated Research by the British Psychological Society, a valid consent can be assumed if there is an information sheet defining the study objectives and exact nature of questions before filling in the questionnaire, including a check box at its beginning and end where participants can tick in to give their explicit consent [52]. In addition, the Society recommends using a proper wording for \u201cI agree\u201d statements to encourage participants to read the information sheet, which should also include their rights to withdraw from the study at any time in a user friendly manner [52]. The Consortium could follow these guidelines to enhance its e-consent procedures. It is important to ensure that participants agreed (by clicking on an \u201cI agree\u201d checkbox) to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies listed on the informed consent sheet before being allowed to fill in the questionnaire. Such measures should be taken to ensure the validity of the informed consent from participants and for harmonization purposes, a standard information sheet could be used throughout the Consortium.",

Furthermore, any data that are shared with the public through the Web portal are fully anonymized and highly aggregated [14]. As to the anonymized data shared with members of the Consortium, it can be aggregated or not depending on whether the national partner who owns the data agrees to the request. It is also worth noting that sharing of Influenzanet data with internal and external researchers should not pose a priori any legal barriers because the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council will not apply to data being rendered anonymous, that is, the information is not linked to an identified or identifiable natural person (Recital 26) and shared for research and statistical purposes [53]. From information gathered on some Influenzanet platforms (ie, France and Switzerland), it appears that linked anonymization [54] is involved in ensuring data protection, whereby participants\u2019 email addresses and pseudonyms are stripped from the gathered health-related data before analysis and stored separately. It will be difficult to conclude how challenging or easy it could be to reidentify participants directly or indirectly from specific combination of variables (which are anonymous if considered in isolation but permit the identification if several of them are combined), in particular for vulnerable groups where privacy risks are higher [48] or groups with rare variable entries, for instance, large household compositions with >6 persons (that only account for 2% of households in the European Union [55]).",

Thus, these differences could hinder future productive cross-national collaboration, which will be detrimental to research and quality disease surveillance. The consent requirements and practice could be harmonized through international or European Union regulations. However, this could take some time; for instance, General Data Protection Regulation aims to harmonize data protection laws within the 28 European Union Member States to ensure an equivalent level of protection and freedoms of individuals within the European Union. At the same time, it will protect cross-border flows of personal data on European Union citizens to international organizations or third countries [56,57]. A quicker harmonization alternative would be for all national platforms of Influenzanet to use the strictest consent requirements and practice currently used by one of their platforms to find common ground.This particular platform would then be used as a benchmark for other country platforms to harmonize their practices.",

Consequently, despite our collaboration with the Consortium to verify our claims, we cannot guarantee that our interpretations are error free. Another limitation is that we do not have access to projects\u2019 evaluation reports from RECs (except for Switzerland) to understand how they judge and approve such research projects.

Thus, harmonizing ethical requirements across the Consortium is feasible and could be achieved through the adoption of the strictest ethical requirements and practice currently used by one platform across the Consortium. Nonetheless, despite being similar, it does not automatically mean that these ethical approaches are adequately regulated. We recommend more transparency in terms of ethical issues related to this type of technology-driven public health research. These transparency modifications related to the current ELSIs of Influenzanet will help to build trust among the members of the general public, in particular, if they are properly informed about the expected benefits and potential risks their participation entails; this will prevent any decline in participation, which might be triggered by mediatization, including exaggeration, of the risks of public health surveillance using Web-based communities of volunteer citizens.",

These characteristics could allow Influenzanet to be deployed in low- and middle-income countries to monitor emerging and reemerging infectious diseases [17].",

Moreover, we also suggest that such systems increase the validity of their informed e-consent procedures by following the excellent ethical guidelines provided by the British Psychological Society. Such measures will further increase the benefits Influenzanet and Influenzanet-like systems could bring to society by promoting the comparability of data and safeguarding participants\u2019 trust on which they rely almost completely for data collection. These will ensure that Influenzanet-like systems are making even greater substantial contributions to global public health and reduce the health inequalities in societies worldwide through better targeting of public health interventions in line with the concept of precision global health in the digital age [58].",
