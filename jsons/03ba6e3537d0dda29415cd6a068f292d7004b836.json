The present analysis additionally provides a method for the practical identification of epidemiological parameters appearing in the SIR (Susceptible -Infected -Removed) compartmental model. Because the proposed approach is robust to under-reporting, it provides a simple way to estimate the basic reproductive number of an outbreak from reported incidence data. The classical SIR model (see for instance [2] ) is the simplest compartmental model that captures the basic phenomenon of disease transmission: before recovering (or being removed through diseaseinduced death), infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals, who in turn become infected. The process repeats itself until the epidemic has followed its course and no additional infections occur. Many outbreaks have a time scale that is much shorter than the scale at which the total population of N individuals changes, leading to the assumption that N is constant. Defining the time-dependent quantities s = S/N, i = I/N, and r = R/N as the expected sizes of the susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments relative to the total population N, so that s + i + r = 1, the SIR model is given by",

We call such a curve an ICC (incidence -cumulative cases) curve. In the present article, we provide an exact expression for the ICC curve of the SIR model, in the form of the following theorem.

However, the ICC curve is well defined for C in the range [0, C \u221e ], which is the definition we adopt here. Even though the time variable does not appear in the ICC curve, the value of \u03ba is not arbitrary: C(0) is the value of C when R = 0, where R represents the removed compartment. An approximate expression of the SIR ICC curve, assuming \u03ba = 1 and C/N sufficiently small was given in [1] . ICC curves are particularly useful for forecasting the course of an outbreak because they contain information on quantities that are of interest to public health practitioners, namely the final number of cases (C \u221e ) and peak incidence (I max ). The latter is simply the maximum of G \u03ba,N ; the former may be found as follows. Since C is the cumulative number of cases, C is a monotonic function of time and its derivative, G \u03ba,N (C), must remain non-negative. For C/N small,",

Given a simulated time series for the number of cases of an outbreak in a population of size N , we find the parameters of the ICC curve that best fits the data by least square minimization. This approach is different from parameter identification methods that have been proposed in the literature until now. Indeed, traditional methods aim to find the best combination of model parameters consistent with observed time series; they therefore require numerical integration of the compartmental model whose parameters need to be identified, in order to estimate and then minimize an associated cost function (see for instance [9] [10] [11] ). Instead, the approach we put forward here consists in finding model parameters by directly fitting the relevant ICC curve to the data. We claim that this is a more robust approach because the functional that needs to be minimized has a unique extremizer in parameter space, which can be calculated exactly from the data points.",

As discussed above, the SIR model will be declared practically identifiable provided good estimates of the parameters may be obtained from noisy data. We therefore simulate 100,000 noisy time series from a \"reference\" numerical integration of the SIR model, use the formulas of Appendix A to calculate p c , \u03b2 c , and \u03b3 c for each time series, and plot histograms of the estimated values of \u03b2 and \u03b3. We consider the two types of noise discussed above, both affecting the reported discrete incidence Figure 3 shows the distributions (in the form of properly scaled histograms) of \u03b2 c , \u03b3 c , and R 0 = \u03b2c \u03b3c obtained from 100,000 noisy realization from a reference simulation of an SIR model with parameters \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.25 (R 0 = 2). Figure 4 shows similar plots for \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 0.0476, so that R 0 = 10.5. In each case, the size of the total population is N = 10000 individuals. The corresponding sample means and standard deviations are displayed in Table 1 . These results indicate that the respective means of \u03b2 c and \u03b3 c provide very good estimates of the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3. Accuracy is not as good for the larger value of R 0 , whose distribution shows a fairly long tail. This is to be expected because the actual value of \u03b3 in this case is close to zero. Moreover, the number of data points away from the end points of the outbreak is much smaller for R 0 = 10.5 than for R 0 = 2 (see Figure 2 ), leading to a potential loss of information. Table  1 .

The data points used in the evaluation of the RMSE are found from the reported cumulative data after smoothing and interpolation. This latter procedure estimates missing incidence values and removes negative incidence reports, if any. The resulting time series is expected to be a better approximation of the \"true\" (i.e. as close as possible to the output of a compartmental model) evolution of the cumulative data, and is used for the parameter estimation procedure discussed in this article. Our first example is for a gastroenteritis outbreak in a nursing home in Majorca, Spain, and is therefore spatially localized. The other examples are estimations of the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 outbreaks in Hubei Province (China), the Republic of Korea, and France. 5.1. Gastroenteritis outbreak in Majorca, Spain. We use the same data set as in [1] , estimated from the epidemiological curve provided in [14] . We fit the ICC curve to the interpolated data (i.e. find \u03b2 c (N ), \u03b3 c (N ), and p c (N )) for a range of values of N , identify the value N m of N that best fits the data (i.e. for which the RMSE is minimum), and select a range of values of N near N m that give a RMSE within 2% of its minimum. Then, for each value of N in the selected range, we apply the parameter estimation procedure discussed in this article, with 10,000 oubreak realizations, obtained from adding Poisson-distributed noise to the smoothed and interpolated data. Figure 7 shows the resulting parameter distributions (top panel; N \u2208 [96, 147]) and a plot of the ICC curve for the average parameter values (bottom panel; N = 121, \u03b2 = 1.37, and \u03b3 = 0.91). The value of R 0 for the ICC curve displayed is 1.52 (whereas the average value of R 0 is 1.55), and corresponds to an attack rate of 59.4%. This is near the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval (38.5 % -61.3 %) for the overall attack rate, but well within the 95% confidence interval of the attack rate among nursing home residents (42.1 % -72.2 %) reported in [14] . Figure 8 shows ICC curves for COVID-19 outbreaks in a few countries. The data was obtained from the World Health Organization daily situation reports [15] as well as from the Wuhan Health Municipal Commission [16] . For Hubei Province, only laboratory confirmed cases were used. Consequently, daily increment values for 2/17-19/2020 (days 65 to 67 in the data set, when China combined laboratory and clinically confirmed cases in its reports for a brief period of time) were set to half of the reported number of confirmed cases; the number of cumulative cases was then obtained by summing daily reports of laboratory confirmed cases. For the Republic of Korea, only the first 58 points in the data set were used, since they correspond to the first wave of the outbreak. The third example is for a country (France), where the outbreak appears to have passed its peak (as of 4/15/2020), but is not over. In all of these examples, the figure shows the ICC curve for the set of parameters that best fits the interpolated data. The optimal values of N are N = 51160 for Hubei Province, N = 10282 for the Republic of Korea, and N = 161138 for France. The corresponding optimal values of the basic reproductive number are R 0 = 2.74 for Hubei Province, R 0 = 2.13 for the Republic of Korea, and R 0 = 1.96 for France. A histogram of estimated values of R 0 , scaled to represent a probability distribution function, is shown in the right panel of each row of Figure 8 . These were obtained as described above in the case of the outbreak in Majorca, except that no Poisson-distributed noise was added to the data. This is because incidence values are generally large and that, as discussed in Section 3, the relative effect of the added noise is minimal, leading to a level of variability of R 0 that is insignificant compared to the effect of changing N . Values of R 0 in the 2-3 range are consistent with early estimates of the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 published in the literature [17, 18] . The time course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province, as described by the SIR model with the optimal parameters identified by the present method (\u03b2 = 0.401, \u03b3 = 0.146 (R 0 = 2.74), and N = 51160) is shown in Figure 9 , together with the reported data. The solid curves are obtained by integration of the ICC curve, with initial conditions corresponding to day 10 of the outbreak, and alignment with the data at day 45. Similar plots for the other outbreaks discussed in this section are provided as supplementary material. The good visual agreement between model and data indicates that the SIR model, and therefore of the ICC curve approach presented in this manuscript, are able to capture the overal dynamics of real-life outbreaks.",

The examples of Section 5 suggest that this parameter may be identified by optimizing the fit between the ICC curve and a smoothed and interpolated version of the reported data. However, any variability in the selected value of N will be associated with variability in estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 . Indeed, for an outbreak that has completed its course, any good fit of the reported data by an ICC curve will produce consistent values of C \u221e , the final number of cases for the outbreak (see for instance the plots of Figure 8 ). Because of Equation 3, if C \u221e is known, the estimated value of R 0 is only a function of N . This uncertainty is inherent to the SIR model and cannot be avoided. The existence of a value N m of N that best fits the data is encouraging, but more robust estimates are likely to be obtained if additional information is available.

For R 0 = 10.5, the time course of S, I, and R (in the absence of noise) together with the corresponding ICC curve, are shown in Figure S3 . The following pages show the temporal evolution of the histograms of \u03b2 c , \u03b3 c , and \u03b2 c /\u03b3 c for Poisson-distributed noise ( Figure S4 ) and normallydistributed noise of amplitude 0.05 ( Figure S5 ) and 0.15 ( Figure S6 ). Finally, Figure S7 and Figure  S8 show the temporal evolution of the parameter distribution means, together with error bars of one standard deviation about the mean. Estimates of \u03b2, \u03b3 and R 0 as the outbreak unfolds for Poissondistributed noise (left) and normally-distributed noise of size 0.05 (right), and with R 0 = 10.5. Estimates of R 0 show the evolution of < \u03b2/\u03b3 > (circles) and < \u03b2 > / < \u03b3 > (stars), where < \u00b7 > indicates sample mean. Error bars correspond to one standard deviation on each side of the mean. Figure S8 . Estimates of \u03b2, \u03b3 and R 0 as the outbreak unfolds for normallydistributed noise of size 0.15, and with R 0 = 10.5. Estimates of R 0 show the evolution of < \u03b2/\u03b3 > (circles) and < \u03b2 > / < \u03b3 > (stars), where < \u00b7 > indicates sample mean. Error bars correspond to one standard deviation on each side of the mean.",
