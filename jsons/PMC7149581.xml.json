            "text": "In 1869, Raulin reported for the first time that zinc was essential for the growth of microorganisms. Many years later in 1926, zinc was recognized as a growth factor for plants. In 1934, zinc was shown to be essential for the growth of rats (Todd et al., 1933). In 1958, zinc was shown to be essential for the growth of poultry. However, until 1961, zinc was not considered to be essential for human health and most scientists considered it improbable that zinc deficiency in humans would lead to a significant clinical problem. This dogma has now changed. Our studies in 1963 established, for the first time, that zinc was essential for human health and that its deficiency occurred in the Middle East (Prasad et al., 1963). The current estimate of the World Health Organization (WHO) is that nearly 2 billion subjects in the developing world may be affected by zinc deficiency. Populations living in villages of the developing world subsist on a cereal protein diet high in phytate, an organic phosphate compound which renders zinc unavailable for absorption. Acquired deficiency of zinc has now been reported in many diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal disease, malabsorption syndrome, chronic alcoholism, sickle cell disease, and other chronic diseases including malignancies (Prasad, 1993).",

In the early 1960s, we knew of only three enzymes, carbonic anhydrase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and carboxypeptidase, which required zinc for their activities (Prasad, 1993, Prasad, 2013). Today, we know of over 300 enzymes that are zinc dependent. At present, we know that over 2000 transcription factors required for gene expression of various proteins need zinc for maintenance of their structures and for their binding to DNA. Moreover, zinc is now known to be a second messenger for immune cells. Zinc is essential for cell-mediated immunity, and zinc is both an antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent (Prasad, 2013). The intracellular zinc level is tightly controlled and for its homeostasis, we now know that there are 14 ZIP and 10 ZNT transporters (Prasad, 2013). In this chapter, I will present a brief history of how zinc was discovered as an essential element for humans, the impact of this discovery on human health, and the biomarkers of zinc deficiency.",

The serum zinc concentration was significantly decreased. They administered oral zinc sulfate to correct this deficiency. Surprisingly, the skin lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms cleared up after this therapy. When zinc was inadvertently omitted from the child\u2019s regimen, the child suffered a relapse; however, she again completely responded to oral zinc therapy. The authors then realized that zinc might have been fundamental to the pathogenesis of this rare inherited disorder and that the clinical improvement reflected correction of zinc status in the patient. This original observation was quickly confirmed in other patients with AE throughout the world. The underlying pathogenesis of the zinc deficiency in these patients is due to malabsorption of zinc caused by a mutation in ZIP4, an intestinal zinc transporter (Wang et al., 2002).",

Neuropsychiatric signs include irritability, emotional instability, tremors, and occasional cerebellar ataxia.

Hirano et al. (Hirano et al., 2008, Kitamura et al., 2006, Haase and Rink, 2007, Rosenkranz et al., 2011) have shown that a decrease in intracellular free zinc is critical for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated CD4+ T-cell activation by dendritic cells (DCs). LPS binds to TLR4 on DCs and initiates Myd88 and TRIF-mediated signaling (domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2) (Hirano et al., 2008, Kitamura et al., 2006, Haase and Rink, 2007, Rosenkranz et al., 2011). TRIF-mediated signaling increases ZNT-5 mRNA and decreases ZIP-6 mRNA, thus resulting in a decrease in the intracellular free zinc in DCs. Reduction in intracellular free zinc increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecules, which is important for the activation of CD4+ T-cells (Hirano et al., 2008, Kitamura et al., 2006). Moreover, zinc affects the activity of monocytes and macrophages in several ways. Zinc is required in monocyte/macrophage development (Shankar and Prasad, 1998, Prasad et al., 2004, Prasad et al., 2011, Bao et al., 2010, Bao et al., 2011) and it regulates various functions such as phagocytosis and proinflammatory cytokine production. LPS stimulation of zinc-sufficient monocytes results in downregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 (Shankar and Prasad, 1998, Prasad et al., 2004, Prasad et al., 2011, Bao et al., 2010, Bao et al., 2011). Zinc inhibits the cell membrane phosphodiesterase, leading to elevated levels of the second messenger cGMP, which is followed by a subsequent suppression of the NF-\u03baB-dependent mRNAs of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other inflammatory cytokines (Shankar and Prasad, 1998, Prasad et al., 2004, Prasad et al., 2011, Bao et al., 2010, Bao et al., 2011). Additionally, zinc induces A-20 which inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling via TNF receptor-associated pathways, resulting in downregulation of mRNAs encoding inflammatory cytokines (Prasad et al., 2004, Prasad et al., 2011, Bao et al., 2010). Based on these findings, we propose that zinc is an important antiinflammatory agent.",

Zinc deficiency is also correlated with risk of respiratory tract infections, but the benefit of supplementation appears to be limited to more severe episodes and in populations with a high incidence of zinc deficiency (Fisher Walker et al., 2011). Diarrhea causes breakdown of the absorptive mucosa resulting in poor absorption of nutrients, including zinc. Prior studies linked diarrheal illness to the loss of endogenous zinc (Fisher Walker et al., 2011). Children with low plasma zinc were observed to be more susceptible to diarrhea, propagating a cycle of deficiency and infection. There is extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of zinc supplementation for the prevention of childhood diarrhea (Fisher Walker et al., 2011). In 2004, the WHO issued a global recommendation for the daily supplementation with 20 mg zinc in children \u22656 months and 10 mg of zinc in infants under 6 months for 10\u201314 days upon diarrheal onset.",

More than 20 viruses cause the common cold and these include rhinoviruses, corona viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses. Annually, adults in the United States may suffer two to four times with the common cold and children may develop colds six to eight times in a year. The morbidity and subsequent financial loss resulting from absenteeism from work is substantial. Previously prescribed treatments have not provided a consistent relief of symptoms. We tested the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges in the common cold in 50 volunteers who were recruited within 24 h of developing symptoms of the common cold and we carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Prasad et al., 2000). Participants took one lozenge containing 12.8 mg zinc (as zinc acetate) or placebo every 2\u20133 h while awake as soon as they developed common cold symptoms. Subjective symptom scores for sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle ache, fever, and headache were recorded daily for 12 days. Plasma zinc and proinflammatory cytokines were assayed on day 1 and after participants were well. Twenty-five in the zinc group and 23 in the placebo group completed the study. Compared to the placebo group, the zinc group had shorter overall duration of cold symptoms (4.5 vs. 8.1 days; p\n < .01), cough (3.1 vs. 6.3 days; p\n = .01), and nasal discharge (4.1 vs. 5.8 days; p\n = .02), and decreased total severity scores for all symptoms (p\n < .002).",

Growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, hyperammonemia, abnormal dark adaptation, and cell-mediated immune dysfunction in SCD patients have been related to a deficiency of zinc. The biochemical evidences of zinc deficiency in SCD patients were: decreased levels of zinc in the plasma, erythrocytes, and hair; hyperzincuria; decreased activities of certain zinc-dependent enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes, alkaline phosphatase in the neutrophils, deoxythymidine kinase activity in newly synthesizing skin connective tissue and collagen; and hyperammonemia (Prasad et al., 1999, Bao et al., 2008). Inasmuch as zinc is known to be an inhibitor of ribonuclease (RNase), an increased activity of this enzyme in plasma was considered to be also an evidence of zinc deficiency. Zinc supplementation to SCD patients resulted in significant improvement in secondary sexual characteristics, normalization of plasma ammonia level, and correction of dark adaptation abnormality. Zinc supplementation also increased zinc levels in plasma, erythrocytes, and neutrophils. Expected response to zinc supplementation on enzyme activities was also observed. Increased longitudinal growth and body-weight in 14- to 18-year-old SCD patients were observed. Zinc supplementation also corrected impaired delayed type hypersensitivity and decreased NK cell lytic activity in SCD patients (Prasad et al., 1999, Bao et al., 2008).\n",

Eventually, not only the liver but also the brain and other organs are damaged due to excess copper accumulation. Patients typically present with liver disease, neurological disease (movement disorder), or psychiatric disturbances in the second to fourth decades of life. In many cases, the diagnosis is either missed or delayed (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977). The gene for Wilson\u2019s disease has been now identified. The genetic mutation leads to defective production of a protein called ATP7B which is responsible for key step in biliary excretion of copper (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977). The disease is recessive, thus both copies of the ATP7B gene have to be mutated to cause a failure in biliary excretion of copper and produce the disease. A large number of mutations in this gene causing Wilson\u2019s disease have been identified.",

Ninety percent of Wilson\u2019s disease patients have low levels of ceruloplasmin and ceruloplasmin-bound copper and nonceruloplasmin-bound copper is elevated in the plasma. Measurement of the 24 h urinary copper is a good diagnostic test; it is consistently elevated in these patients (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977). Urinary copper, however, may be elevated in patients with obstructive liver disease also who do not have Wilson\u2019s disease. A slit lamp examination for corneal copper deposits (Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings) is a very useful noninvasive diagnostic test for Wilson\u2019s disease. This, however, is positive in only 50% of the cases. The initial treatment objective is to decrease copper burden. It is also desirable to prevent copper from shifting from one pool to the other while decoppering is being done. Initial copper control treatment may take 2\u20134 months (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977).",

            "text": "Several years ago, we were using 150 mg elemental zinc in six divided doses for the treatment of SCD patients (Prasad et al., 1978a). We observed that zinc was an effective antisickling drug. We observed, however, that at this level of zinc therapy, deficiency of copper was induced in our patients. This led Brewer et al. (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977) to develop zinc as an effective anticopper drug for Wilson\u2019s disease. Zinc competes with copper for similar binding sites and oral zinc efficiently decreases uptake of copper (Hall et al., 1979). Zinc may act by induction of intestinal cell metallothionein (MT). MT, once induced, has a high affinity for binding copper and prevents the serosal transfer of copper into the blood. The intestinal cells turn over rapidly and take the complexed copper into the stool for final excretion. Zinc not only blocks food copper but also the copper which is endogenously excreted via salivary, gastric, and other gastrointestinal juices. Thus, zinc is effective in producing a negative copper balance. Fifty milligram elemental zinc (as acetate) is given orally three times a day for management of Wilson\u2019s disease patients. Zinc is given in a fasting or postabsorptive state. The only side effect is that 10% of the subjects may have gastric discomfort. This is usually observed after the first morning dose and this can be avoided if zinc is administered between breakfast and lunch or after dinner before going to bed. Zinc is the drug of choice for maintenance therapy (Brewe and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, 1992, Brewer, 1995, Brewer et al., 1977). Zinc has no toxicity and is nonteratogenic, thus it can be given to subjects of all ages and even to pregnant women. Zinc has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease patients.",

Newsome et al. (1996) demonstrated that concentrations of zinc are reduced in human eyes with signs of AMD and they suggested that zinc deficiency may have led to oxidative stress and retinal damage. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group (AREDS) supported by National Eye Institute, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted an 11-center double-masked clinical trial in patients with dry-type AMD (Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research group (AREDS Report No. 8), 2001). A total of 3640 participants were enrolled. Their ages ranged from 55 to 80 years and the average follow-up period was 6.3 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily orally one of the following: (1) antioxidants (vitamin C 500 mg, Vitamin E 400 IU, and beta carotene 15 mg); (2) zinc, 80 mg as zinc oxide, and copper, 2 mg as copper oxide, to prevent copper deficiency induced by zinc; (3) antioxidants plus zinc; or (4) placebo. The group taking the antioxidant plus zinc reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by about 25% and vision loss by about 19%. The group taking zinc alone reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by about 21% and the vision loss by 11%. In the group taking the vitamins alone, the risk of developing advanced AMD was decreased by 17% and the vision loss was decreased by 10%. No significant side effects were noted in the group who received high levels of therapeutic zinc (Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research group (AREDS Report No. 8), 2001). Only the zinc-supplemented group showed increased longevity (AREDS Report No.13, 2004, Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group (AREDS Report No. 35), 2013). The risk of mortality was reduced by 27% in AREDS studies in subjects who received therapeutic zinc daily. No other micronutrient is known to have a similar effect on mortality. In a later publication, the AREDS group observed that a decrease in mortality was due to a decrease in cardiovascular events (AREDS Report No.13, 2004, Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group (AREDS Report No. 35), 2013).",

Elderly subjects frequently do not eat the usual three meals a day and they may skip either breakfast or lunch. Many live alone and do not cook proper meals for themselves. Our study in the Detroit area has shown that 35% of the well-to-do ambulatory elderly subjects may have a deficiency of zinc. Results of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u20131994) also reported that elderly persons >71 years were at the greatest risk of inadequate zinc intakes (Bao et al., 2010, Prasad et al., 1993, Prasad et al., 2007). Oxidative stress and increased inflammatory cytokines have been recognized as important contributing factors for several chronic diseases attributed to aging, such as atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular disorders, mutagenesis and cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Together, O2\u2212, H2O2, and OH radicals are known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and excessive generation of ROS causes oxidative stress. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, generated by activated monocytes, are also known to generate greater levels of ROS. In the elderly, chronic inflammatory processes have been implicated as causing high cardiovascular mortality (Bao et al., 2010).",

A comparison of the baseline data between the younger subjects (ages 18\u201354, n\n = 31) and the elderly subjects showed that the plasma zinc was lower and the percentage of cells producing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in the elderly subjects (Prasad et al., 2007). Intercellular adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and E-selectin in the plasma also were significantly higher in the elderly. IL-10 generated by Th2 cells, which is known to negatively regulate IL-2 generation from TH1 cells, was significantly higher in the elderly. Moreover, oxidative stress markers were significantly higher in the elderly compared to the younger adults (Bao et al., 2010, Prasad et al., 2007). The mean incidence of infections per subject was lower (p\n < .01) in the zinc-supplemented group (1.4 \u00b1 0.95) versus the placebo group (20.29 \u00b1 0.46). Plasma zinc increased, and ex vivo generation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 decreased significantly in the zinc group in comparison to the placebo group (Prasad et al., 2007). Oxidative stress biomarkers in the plasma also decreased significantly in the zinc group in comparison to the placebo group (Bao et al., 2010). In MNCs isolated from zinc-deficient elderly subjects, zinc supplementation increased the ex vivo PHA-induced IL-2 mRNA expression, and plasma zinc concentration in comparison to the zinc-deficient subjects who received placebo (Prasad et al., 2007). Thus, our study showed that zinc supplementation (45 mg elemental zinc daily) to elderly subjects decreased the incidence of infection by nearly 66%. Following supplementation, oxidative stress markers, and the generation of inflammatory cytokines, which were increased prior to supplementation, decreased significantly. These are highly significant effects of zinc supplementation in the elderly and it may imply that zinc may prove to be an excellent agent for the prevention of some of the chronic diseases of aging.",

Soon after my arrival, I got a call from Walter Slavin from Perkin\u2013Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT. He told me that now they have made available an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) which could make my life simpler and that I could measure zinc in the plasma without any difficulty. Not only that, he also offered to donate one instrument for my research. I was truly overwhelmed. I received the instrument but I could not assay zinc in the serum or plasma. Later, Walter told me that he sent the machine to me to develop methods for measurement of zinc in plasma and cells. We worked hard on the technique and finally succeeded. We published that method for measurement of zinc in plasma, red bold cells, and urine in 1965 (Prasad et al., 1965) and this technique is being used globally for measurement of plasma zinc even now. The problem was that plasma contained protein and salts which altered the flow of samples, and plasma zinc could not be measured and compared to the standard solutions of zinc which did not contain any interfering substances. Initially, we lyophilized the plasma, dissolved the lyophilized plasma in HCl and used trichloracetic acid to precipitate the proteins. This technique was carefully worked out and simplified and the method was then published (Prasad et al., 1965).",

We recruited adult human volunteers for induction of dietary zinc deficiency. The details of selection of subjects and our protocol have been published earlier (Prasad et al., 1978b). The volunteers were kept on the metabolic ward in a Clinical Research Center at the University of Michigan Medical School and the study was supported by a grant from the NIH. They were monitored very closely by the physicians and clinical staff. A semipurified diet based on texturized soy protein was developed for this study. The diet provided adequate calcium, proteins, fats, and all essential nutrients according to the RDAs except for zinc (Prasad et al., 1978b). The experiment was designed to last for 56 weeks. Before the start of the experiment, subjects received normal hospital diets that provided 10 mg zinc/day for 4 weeks. Then for 8 weeks (stabilization phase), the semipurified diet was served. It was supplemented with 10 mg zinc as sulfate incorporated in cookies providing a total of 13.9 mg zinc/day. During the following 28 weeks, subjects entered the depletion phase, and the zinc supplementation was discontinued. Thus, during the depletion phase the dietary intake of zinc ranged from 3 to 5 mg/day. Following this in repletion phase for 20 weeks, subjects consumed a total of 30 mg zinc per day. In this model we studied several biomarkers of zinc deficiency. These included measurement of zinc in plasma, red blood cells, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and urine; assays for the following enzymes: deoxythymidine kinase activity in collagen connective tissue harvested following an implantation of sponge under the skin, 5\u2032NT in lymphocytes (a marker of maturity of lymphocytes), and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase; serum active thymulin; generation of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3; and assay of mRNAs of Th1 cytokines in stimulated cells.",

The lymphocyte pools are contaminated with platelets and therefore, careful steps were taken to remove the platelets from lymphocytes. Similarly, in the granulocyte pool, the problem was similar with respect to contamination with erythrocytes. We have published detailed methods and by this technique, we were able to measure zinc in platelets, lymphocytes, and granulocytes accurately (Wang et al., 1989). In the human experimental model of zinc deficiency, we observed that when the daily dietary zinc intake of our volunteers was around 3\u20135 mg, the plasma zinc decreased after 24 weeks.

We assayed for 5\u2032 NT activity in the lymphocytes of two groups of subjects (Meftah et al., 1991). The first group of subjects had a mild state of zinc deficiency, as assessed by zinc levels in lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets, but were healthy otherwise. We supplemented them with 50 mg zinc as acetate orally for 12 weeks. The second group of six subjects were normal human volunteers in whom a mild deficiency of zinc was induced by a dietary technique (4.2\u20135.6 mg zinc intake daily). For the assay of 5\u2032 NT, intact lymphocytes were incubated with 8-C14-labeled ionosine monophosphate as substrate. Product and substrate were separated by thin layer chromatography. In the first group of subjects with zinc deficiency, the decreased activity of 5\u2032 NT was corrected and the cellular zinc levels normalized by zinc supplementation. In the second group of subjects, the baseline data were compared with those in early zinc depletion (4\u20138 weeks) and late depletion period (20 weeks). A decrease in the activity of 5\u2032 NT was observed in the early depletion phase. Zinc levels in lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets decreased significantly only during the late zinc depletion phase. Plasma zinc level did not change even during the late zinc depletion phase. Our studies thus showed that 5\u2032 NT activity is a sensitive and useful biomarker of human zinc deficiency. A decreased activity of 5\u2032NT in zinc-deficient lymphocytes may be indicative of lymphocyte immaturity in human zinc deficiency (Meftah et al., 1991) (see Figure 20.1, Figure 20.2, Figure 20.3, Figure 20.4\n).\n",

Thymulin requires the presence of zinc to express its biological activity. It is known that two forms of thymulin exist; the first one deprived of zinc is biologically inactive, and the second one, containing zinc, is biologically active (Prasad et al., 1988). The zinc/thymulin relationship was first studied in zinc-deficient mice. Active thymulin levels in sera of mice subjected to a long-term marginal zinc deficiency decreased as early as 2 months after beginning of the diet (Prasad et al., 1988). However, these levels were corrected after in vitro addition of ZnCl2. Similar observations were made with sera obtained from children suffering from nephrotic syndrome who were zinc deficient. The low level of active thymulin in sera was corrected after in vitro addition of ZnCl2. These results confirm the presence of the inactive hormone in the serum of zinc-deficient subjects and its potential activation following in vitro zinc addition. The specificity of these results was confirmed by the lack of activation on experiments performed with sera from the thymectomized mice or patients with Di-George\u2019s syndrome, in whom the hormone is nonexistent.",

In all of these subjects, the serum active thymulin was decreased, and this was corrected by both in vivo and in vitro zinc supplementation, suggesting that serum thymulin activity assay was a sensitive biomarker of zinc deficiency (Prasad et al., 1988). We also observed that T4+/T8+ ratio was decreased and the generation of IL-2 was decreased, and both of these were corrected following zinc supplementation. Inasmuch as thymulin is known to induce intra- and extra-thymic T-cell differentiation, our studies provided a possible mechanism for the role of zinc on T-cell functions (Prasad et al., 1988; see Figure 20.5, Figure 20.6, Figure 20.7, Figure 20.8\n).",

In our experimental human model of zinc deficiency, when the dietary zinc intake was restricted to 2\u20133.5 mg/day for 20\u201324 weeks, the plasma zinc declined (mean \u00b1 SD) from 109.8 \u00b1 17 to 91.8 \u00b1 10.5 \u03bcg/dL. Although the change in plasma zinc was small, a significant decrease in IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 generated ex vivo by isolated MNCs was observed (Beck et al., 1997a, Beck et al., 1997b, Prasad et al., 1988). Also, regeneration of new CD4+ T lymphocytes was decreased as a result of dietary zinc restriction. In another study, dietary zinc restriction was 4.2\u20135.6 mg/day. At this level, the plasma zinc decreased from (mean \u00b1 SD) 118.02 \u00b1 5.3 to 108.0 \u00b1 10.3 \u03bcg/dL at the end of 8 weeks in the zinc-restricted period. Moreover, the activity of lymphocyte 5\u2032 NT was significantly decreased (Meftah et al., 1991). When the zinc intake in the volunteers averaged 3.0 mg/day, a decrease in serum thymulin activity was observed between 8 and 12 weeks, but no decrease was seen in this period in plasma zinc concentration (Prasad et al., 1988). Thus, it appears that significant changes in immunological functions due to mild zinc deficiency may be observed in the absence of significant decreases in the plasma zinc concentration, suggesting that the assay of zinc-dependent immunologic functions may be better indicators of human zinc deficiency.",

The effect of zinc was at the transcriptional level and was specific for IL-2 (Prasad et al., 2002). A significant effect of zinc on the gene expression and generation of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2 was also demonstrated in that the expression of these genes was decreased in zinc-deficient cells. In another study, we reported that in zinc-deficient HUT-78 cells, phosphorylated I\u03baB and I\u03baK, ubiquitinated I\u0138\u03b2, and binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA were all significantly decreased in comparison to the zinc-sufficient cells (Prasad et al., 2001). Zinc increased the translocation of the NF-\u03baB p50 subunit from cytosol to nucleus (Prasad et al., 2001). Also, the binding of recombinant NF-\u03baB (p50)2 to DNA in HUT-78 cells was zinc specific. Our studies also showed that the measurement of IL-2 mRNA in peripheral blood MNCs by RT-PCR was a very good indicator of zinc deficiency in humans (Prasad et al., 2006). In zinc-deficient cells, IL-2 mRNA was decreased in comparison to the zinc-sufficient cells, and if a physiological amount of zinc was added to the deficient cells ex vivo, IL-2 mRNA expression was normalized, thus providing a diagnosis for zinc deficiency. It was also demonstrated that the ex vivo addition of zinc effect was specific, inasmuch as no other essential trace element could correct IL-2 mRNA expression in zinc-deficient cases. Our studies also showed that the effect of zinc on the gene expression of IL-2 in the primary cells was because of its role on the activation of NF-\u03baB (Prasad et al., 2006; see Figure 20.9, Figure 20.10, Figure 20.1\n).",

Therefore, it is important to determine whether or not the adapted zinc homeostasis during the short duration of dietary zinc deprivation is also maintained during a prolonged period of dietary zinc restriction. We assessed the efficiency of zinc absorption as well as endogenous zinc excretion during a 6-month period of dietary zinc restriction (63.1 \u03bcm mol/day) in human volunteers by using a stable zinc isotope (Zn70) (Lee et al., 1993). Our studies showed that the efficiency of zinc absorption was not sustained and decreased in the volunteers when the zinc-restricted diet was continued for six months. On the other hand, prolonged dietary zinc restriction did not impair the functional role of endogenous zinc excretion in zinc homeostasis. We observed a significant reduction of endogenous zinc excretion by restricting dietary zinc, and this continued at the end of the zinc-restricted period. The endogenous zinc excretion was 65.2 \u03bcm mol/day during the baseline period, and it gradually decreased to a mean level of 27.1 \u03bcm mol/day at the end of the 6th month of the dietary zinc restriction. When subjects received zinc supplementation, the endogenous zinc excretion increased to 60.1 \u03bcm mol/day. Our studies thus show that measurement of endogenous zinc excretion may also be a sensitive biomarker of human zinc deficiency (Lee et al., 1993) (see Figure 20.12, Figure 20.13, Figure 20.14\n).\n",
