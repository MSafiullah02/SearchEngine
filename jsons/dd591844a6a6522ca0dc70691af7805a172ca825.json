Study carried out in [2001] [2002] . Mean transport times from scene to ED were similar for those who died in ED (8. 3 min) died after admission (7.8 min) and survived to discharge (8.5 min) . The ranges are not reported. This suggests feasible to take all ROSC patients to single urban centre. These transport times are relatively short. The high scene ROSC rate will depend on the EMS system, time at scene. It is not clear how many hospitals were involved and how hospital factors influenced outcome",

There was a difference in survival to discharge between two hospitals served by the same EMS (44% versus 33%, P<001) despite pre-hospital and patient factors being similar. Patients in the hospital with better outcomes had a higher rate of interventions (coronary angiography, echocardiography, exercise testing, cardiac electrophysiology, Holter recording, and coronary angioplasty.

The study could not say if the 44% of the 4674 ICU admissions from the ED were out of hospital cardiac arrests or not. Age and illness adjusted survival varied between 46 and 68%. Hospitals that treated more than 50 cardiac arrests/year had a lower mortality than those who treated less than 20/year (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.86). This study supports there is variation between hospitals. It is difficult to extrapolate the results of this study to management of OOHCA since inclusion of ICU patients only is subject to selection bias, and the study included patients with OOHCA as well as IHCA. The study did not show any significant differences between CATH and Non-CATH hospitals or high/low volume (40 cut-off) after risk adjustment. The study does not list whether patients actually had cardiac catheterization and volume of patients attending hospitals. The hospital size and presence of catheter facilities is inferred to be a surrogate marker for improved post resuscitation care.",
