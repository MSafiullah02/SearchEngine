They were characteristic of enteritis, including congestion, infiltration of inflammatory cells and abscessation of the crypts. The four calves inoculated with strain H209 (pVir) thus evolved in the same way as 1404 wild-type-inoculated calves challenged in a preliminary study [15]. This confirms the hypothesis that factors conferring the ability to cause diarrhea and intestinal lesions in calves as well as the ability to invade organs are located on the Vir plasmid. Related observations were made by Smith [7], since H209 (pVir) caused death by cardiac failure in chicken, whereas H209 did not, and is in any case, considered non-pathogenic [10].",

Or, CDT-III could play a role in the colonization process, and this effect is masked by the presence of the F17 adhesin.
