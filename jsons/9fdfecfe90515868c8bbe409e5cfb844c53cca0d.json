            "text": "Aminopeptidases hydrolyse peptide bonds at the N-terminus of proteins and polypeptides whereas carboxypeptidases hydrolyse peptide bonds at the C-terminus. Omega peptidase is an additional term referring to special types of aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases that are capable of removing terminal residues lacking a free -amino or -carboxyl group, or include linkages other than the -peptide type (e.g. pyroglutamyl peptidases; McDonald and Barret, 1986) . Aminopeptidases can be subdivided into three groups: aminopeptidases in the strict sense which hydrolyse the first peptide bond in a polypeptide chain with the release of a single amino acid residue (aminoacyl-and iminoacyl peptidases [EC 3.4.11] ); those that remove dipeptides or tripeptides (dipeptidyl-and tripeptidyl peptidases [EC 3.4 .14]) from polypeptide chains; and those which only hydrolyse di-or tripeptides (dipeptidases [EC 3.4 .15] and tripeptidases [EC 3.4 .14.4]) (Sanderink et al., 1988) . Aminopeptidases are widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals (Gonzales and Robert-Baudouy, 1996; Tu et al., 2003; Barret et al., 2004) . Theses enzymes are located in different subcellular compartments including the cytoplasm, lysosomes and membranes, and can also be secreted into the extracellular medium. Based on catalytic mechanism, most of the aminopeptidases are metallo-enzymes but cysteine and serine peptidases are also included in this group. Though some aminopeptidases are monomeric, most show multimeric structures particularly those from eukaryotic organisms (McDonald and Barret, 1986; Jones, 1991; Lowther and Matthews, 2002) . The three-dimensional structures of some aminopeptidases have been solved, contributing to the understanding of their catalytic mechanism and functions (Kim et al., 1993; Bazan et al., 1994; Joshua-Tor et al., 1995; Lowther and Matthews, 2002) . Aminopeptidases appear to act in concert with other peptidases to complete diverse proteolytic pathways. Thus, these enzymes can efficiently retrieve amino acids from dietary proteins and endogenous proteins degraded during protein turnover, thereby covering nutritional as well as other biological roles including protein maturation, hormone level regulation and cell-cycle control (McDonald and Barret, 1986; Christensen et al., 1999) . Many of the mammalian enzymes play important functions in cellular processes involved in health and disease and, as a consequence, constitute targets for the pharmaceutical industry (Scornik and Botbol, 2001; Holz et al., 2003; Rigolet et al., 2005; Inguimbert et al., 2005) . Some aminopeptidases are also of great interest for their biotechnological and agro-industrial applications (Seppo et al., 2003; FitzGerald and O'Cuinn, 2006) .",

            "text": "Aminopeptidases have been classified on the basis of their substrate specificity (broad or narrow), catalytic mechanism (metallo-, cysteine, and serine peptidases) and molecular structure (Gonzales and Robert-Baudouy, 1996; Barret et al., 2004; Rawling et al., this volume) . The nomenclature of many (aminoacyl or iminoacyl peptidases) has been determined by their preferences or requirements for a particular N-terminal amino acid. Thus, an enzyme that for instance showed its highest rate of hydrolysis on N-terminal methionyl bonds was named methionyl aminopeptidase or aminopeptidase M. In an attempt to avoid ambiguity, the subcellular location (membrane, microsomal or cytosolic) has also been used to name aminopeptidases having similar specificities. In the cases of di-and tripeptidases their names have been based on substrate size requirements. In addition, the names of dipeptidyl (DPP) and tripeptidyl peptidases (TPP) were followed by a Roman number to differentiate between the various types described and this numbering convention has been retained. In the nomenclature of peptidases identified in lactic acid bacteria the term 'Pep' is used when the corresponding peptidase gene sequence is known, followed by a capital letter indicating the specificity and homology to other known peptidases, e.g. PepN for the homologue of aminopeptidase N (Tan et al., 1993) . Nevertheless, alternative names and abbreviations often appear in the literature. Recently, the MEROPS peptidase information database (http://www.merops.sanger.ac.uk; see chapter by Rawlings et al. in this volume) created a hierarchical structurebased classification of peptidases into families and clans. Members of a family are homologues, and families that are thought to be homologous are grouped together into clans. Clans consist of families of peptidases that share a single evolutionary origin, evidenced by similarities in their tertiary structures and/or the order of catalytic-site residues and common sequence motifs around the catalytic residues.",

The amino acid residue preferentially released is Ala, but most amino acids including Pro may be hydrolysed by this enzyme. When a terminal hydrophobic residue is followed by Pro, the two may be released as an intact X-Pro dipeptide (McDonald and Barret, 1986) . In most species the native enzyme is a homodimer with a molecular mass of 280-300 and is glycosylated. The mammalian enzyme plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from proteins by gastric and pancreatic protease hydrolysis. It is also important for the inactivation in the kidney of blood-borne peptides such as enkephalins and the neuropeptide 'substance P'. Furthermore, it is a regulator of IL-8 bioavailability in the endometrium and therefore may contribute to the regulation of angiogenesis. This aminopeptidase is also the myeloid leukaemia marker CD13 and serves as a receptor for human coronavirus (Shimizu et al., 2002; Albiston et al., 2004) .",

It releases N-terminal Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) from a peptide. It is generally a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the formation of the brain heptapeptide angiotensin III which exerts a tonic stimulatory effect on the central control of blood pressure and is a regulator of blood vessel formation (Fournie-Zaluski et al., 2004.) . Methionyl aminopeptidase has also been named methionine aminopeptidase and peptidase M. It releases N-terminal amino acids, preferentially methionine, from peptides but only when the second residue is small and uncharged. In eukaryotes, two types of methionyl aminopeptidases exist due to protein synthesis occurring in the mitochondria (type I) and in the cytoplasm (type II). The type I peptidase is similar to the bacterial methionyl aminopeptidase whereas type II resembles the enzyme from archaea (Arfin et al., 1995) . The mammalian enzymes are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and in the processing of those proteins required for the formation of new blood vessels in normal development, tumour growth and metastasis (Yeh et al., 2000; Selvakumar et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "This group includes two aminopeptidases: prolyl aminopeptidase and X-Pro aminopeptidase. The prolyl aminopeptidase has variously been named Pro-X aminopeptidase, proline aminopeptidase and proline iminopeptidase. It releases N-terminal proline from a peptide. This enzyme was first detected in E. coli but is widely distributed in nature and also present in the cytosol of mammalian cells (Matsushima et al., 1991) . In contrast to the bacterial form, the mammalian enzyme is not specific for prolyl bonds (Cunningham et al., 1997) . X-Pro aminopeptidase has also been termed aminopeptidase P and proline aminopeptidase. It releases any N-terminal amino acid residue, including proline, from oligopeptides and even dipeptide and tripeptides in which the penultimate N-terminal residue is proline. The preferred substrates have a hydrophobic or basic residue at the N-terminus. The mammalian enzyme exists in membrane-bound and cytosolic forms (Cottrell et al., 2000) . It appears to contribute to the processing of bioactive peptides involved in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, and the degradation of collagen products (Yaron and Naider, 1993; Yoshimoto et al., 1994) . Of the mammalian peptidyl peptidases, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is the best know. It releases an N-terminal dipeptide from polypeptides in which, the penultimate residue is Pro (preferentially but not exclusively) and provided that the antepenultimate residue is neither Pro nor hydroxyproline (Leiting et al., 2003) . This enzyme is anchored to the cell membrane and expressed in various cell types. It has a calculated molecular mass of 88 kDa and the native enzyme is a homodimer. DPP IV plays a key role in various regulatory processes, acting on a number of bioactive oligopeptides including neuropeptides, endomorphins, circulating peptide hormones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and paracrine chemokines, leading to modification of their biological activities or even their inactivation (Augustyns et al., 2005) .",

A homologue to mammalian MAP type 2 is also present in yeast and shows subtle differences in its peptide substrate specificity (Chen et al., 2002) . Aminopeptidase A, also referred to as glutamyl aminopeptidase and PepA, was identified in Lactococcus lactis. The genetic and physicochemical properties of this enzyme are not related to other aminopeptidases in prokaryotes or eukaryotes of similar specificity except for the enzyme purified from Streptococcus thermophilus. It specifically hydrolyses Glu and Asp residues, and to a lesser extent Ser residues, from the N-terminus of oligopeptides. In most cases the native enzyme seems to be a hexamer with a molecular mass of 240 kDa although other values (440-520) have been reported. The lactococcal enzyme was not demonstrated to be essential for growing on milk caseins but is thought to be important for flavour generation in dairy products (l'Anson et al., 1995) .",

These enzymes are believed to play biological roles in protein turnover, stress responses, protein mobilization from cotyledons after germination, protein maturation and meiosis. The aminopeptidases identified in plants also include enzymes of the broad and narrow specificities previously described. Among them, the LAP from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is one of the best characterized animopeptidases of broad specificity. At least two distinct LAPs have been identified which seem to have different expression patterns and roles. The best-known enzyme (LAPa-A) is a wound-induced metallo aminopeptidase which preferentially hydrolyses substrates having N-terminal Leu, Arg or Met residues and with a homo-hexamer structure (Tu et al., 2003) . Aminopeptidase N has also been identified in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. suyo) and Arabidopsis thaliana. This is a metalloenzyme with similar specificity and sequence homology to that of aminopeptidases N which is classified into family M1 (Yamauchi et al., 2001) . Among the aminopeptidases of narrow specificity, methionine aminopeptidases have also been identified in diverse plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, and are required for normal plant development (Ross et al., 2005) . Aminopeptidase P has been identified in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and is more than 40% identical to mammalian aminopeptidase P. It hydrolyses the amino terminal X-Pro bonds of bradykinin and also shows some endoproteolytic activity (Hauser et al., 2001) .",

Some aminopeptidases require a single metal ion for catalysis (e.g. MAP) while others require two metal ions (e.g. LAP from bovine lens; Lowther and Matthews, 2002) . The known metal ligands of metallopeptidases are His, Glu, Asp or Lys residues. In addition to these metal ligands at least one additional residue, which can be Glu, Lys or Arg, is required for catalysis (Barret et al., 2004) . Despite the differences in structure and metal centres among the metalloaminopeptidases, overall they utilize a similar reaction mechanism. The carbonyl group of the substrate binds to the active site interacting with metal site 1 and a conserved enzyme residue. The N-terminus of the substrate also interacts either with metal site 2 or with one or more acidic enzyme residues. The scissile peptide bond is attacked by a solvent molecule that has been activated by its interaction with the metal ion and an enzyme residue that functions as a general base. Breakdown of the intermediate is most likely promoted by the addition of a proton to the leaving amino group donated by the general base. Differences in the binding pockets are responsible for the differences in substrate specificity, being broad or restrictive. Conserved amino acid side chains and the backbone atoms that are adjacent to the metal centre also provide key interactions. The oligomeric nature of some of the active enzymes also appears to be important for substrate specificity (Lowther and Matthews, 2002; Holz et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "Cysteine and serine aminopeptidases have no ionic co-factors associated with their structures. Catalysis requires a highly reactive cysteine or serine residue. In both cases the reaction begins with a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of the carbonyl group involved in the peptide bond of the substrate. In the case of cysteine aminopeptidases the attack is made by the sulphur of the sulphydryl group whereas in the serine aminopeptidases the attack is made by the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (Gonzales and Robert-Baudouy, 1996) .These types of enzymes are less abundant than the metalloaminopeptidases and include cysteine peptidases of relatively broad specificity such as bleomycin hydrolase and PepC, and serine peptidases of narrow specificity such as proline-specific peptidases (PepI or prolyl aminopeptidase, PepX and DPP IV). Cysteine aminopeptidases are included in clan CA and family C1B. They show the signature sequences of the catalytic site of the papain superfamily, and the amino acid residues important for catalysis (Gln, Cys, His, and Asn/Asp). The crystal structures of yeast bleomycin hydrolase (GAL6) and the human enzyme have been solved and show overall similarity (Zheng et al., 1998; Joshua-Tor et al., 1995; O'Farrell et al., 1999) . The proteins are hexameric, the six identical subunits forming barrel structures with the active sites embedded in a prominent central channel (Zheng et al., 1998) . The monomers have a papain-like polypeptide fold as the core, with additional structural and functional modules inserted into loop regions. The crystallographic model of Lactococcus lactis PepC reveals that it is a homohexamer the subunits of which leave a narrow channel restricting the access to peptides. The projection of the C-terminal arm into the active site is a major difference relative to papain which, together with the overall architecture of the hexamer, limits the access to the active site cleft and may explain why peptidase activity observed in vitro has been restricted to small peptides (Joshua-Tor et al., 1995) . This carboxyl-terminal arm, also conserved in bleomycin hydrolases, is critical for oligomerization and aminopeptidase activity but not for endopeptidase activity (Mistou et al., 1994; Joshua-Tor et al., 1995; Mata et al., 1999) .",

Peptide sequence analysis revealed that both prolyl aminopeptidase (PIP), PepI, DPP IV and PepX contain a catalytic triad which consists of Ser, His and Asp, and are related to prolyl oligopeptidases (Engel et al., 2005) . The three-dimensional structures of the PIPs of several bacteria have been solved (Yoshimoto et al., 1999; Engel et al., 2005) . The PIP protein is folded into two contiguous domains. The larger domain shows the general topology of the / hydrolase fold, with a central eight-stranded -sheet flanked by two helices and the 11 N-terminal residues on one side, and by four helices on the other. The smaller domain is located above the larger and consists of six helices (Fig. 2) . The catalytic triad (Ser 113, His 296, and Asp 268) is located near the large cavity at the interface between the two domains. The residues which make up the hydrophobic pocket line the smaller domain, and the specificity of the exo-type enzyme originates from this smaller domain (Yoshimoto et al., 1999) . (Yoshimoto et al., 1999) The crystal structures of lactococcal PepX and a number of mammalian DPP IV enzymes have also been solved as a result of the interest generated by their key roles in diverse regulatory processes and the therapeutic potential of DPP IV inhibitors (Engel et al., 2003) . The mammalian enzyme is an / -hydrolase that is secreted as a mature monomer but requires oligomerization to display normal proteolytic activity. Each monomer (Fig. 3) consists of an N-terminal -propeller domain and an / -hydrolase domain enclosing an internal cavity that harbours the active site. The cavity is connected with the external environment through two different openings, the \"propeller opening\" and a \"side opening\" (Engel et al., 2005) .The lactococcal enzyme is a homodimer with 2-fold symmetry. It folds into four distinct contiguous domains. The / -hydrolase fold is the largest domain and contains the catalytic site. The shortest domain is involved in oligomerization and binding specificity (Chich et al., 1995) .",

As a consequence, pharmaceutical applications are being directed to control their activity in pathophysiological processes as well as the development of diagnosis tools and markers of physiological pathways (Brown, 2005) . Most of the applications Figure 3 . Mammalian (pig kidney) dipeptidyl peptidase (Engel et al., 2003) . Panel A shows a view of the protein facing the N-terminal -propeller domain. Panel B represents the protein from a perpendicular orientation showing the -propeller domain in the upper part and / domain harbouring the catalytic site at the bottom are oriented to the design of inhibitors for specific aminopeptidases. Selective inhibitors of glutamyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase A) constitute potential antihypertensive agents due to the role of this enzyme in the conversion of angiotensin II into angiotensin III, which plays an essential role in control of arterial blood pressure (Cogolludo et al., 2005; Inguimbert et al., 2005) . The design of inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidases is also considered to be of therapeutic potential due to the role of these enzymes in angiogenesis and tumour growth (Selvakumar et al., 2005; Zhong and Bowen, 2006) . Inhibitors of the expression of alanyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase N), which is deregulated in inflammatory diseases, cancer, leukaemia, diabetic nephropathy and rheumatoid arthritis, are also being developed to try to control these disorders (Bauvois and Dauzonne, 2006; Ansorge et al., 2006) . The design of inhibitors of DPP IV and related proline-specific peptidases is currently under investigation since these enzymes are involved in peptide metabolism of members of the PACAP/glucagon peptide family, neuropeptides and chemokines. The most promising applications of these agents are in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and immunological disorders (Augustyns et al., 2005; Mest, 2006) . The inhibition of other aminopeptidases such as PepX (involved in infections by Streptococcus gordonii), the stereospecific DppA aminopeptidase (involved in peptidoglycan synthesis) and methionyl aminopeptidase, also constitute potential pharmaceutical targets to control microbial infections (Holz et al., 2003; Rigolet et al., 2005; Schiffmann et al., 2006) .",

Food protein hydrolysates are manufactured for diverse purposes such as the fortification of foods and beverages, the elaboration of pre-digested ingredients for enteral/parenteral nutrition, and the generation of bioactive peptides and healthcare products (FitzGerald and O'Cuinn, 2006) . The use of animopeptidases in these industrial processes not only contributes to the improvement of nutritional value but also the flavour of the final product by promoting the degradation of hydrophobic peptides which have undesirable tastes and the release of other peptides of agreeable taste characteristics and free amino acids. The application of these strategies to cheese ripening has been thoroughly investigated due to the high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. proline) present in milk caseins (Meyer-Barton et al., 1994; Savijoki et al., 2006) . The use of proline-specific peptidases together with aminopeptidases of broad specificity (e.g. LAP) has been especially successful in the food industry (Raksakulthai and Haard, 2003) . Some of the commercial aminopeptidases that are used to reduce bitterness in food are LAPs from lactic acid bacteria, Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus oryze and Aspergillus sojae (Nampoothiri et al., 2005) . The use of lactic acid bacteria expressing specific peptidase activities during food protein processing is also being explored for reducing the levels of toxic and allergenic epitopes present in milk and cereal proteins (Di Cagno et al., 2004) . A similar approach has also been used for the generation of bioactive peptides with antihypertensive, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties (Meisel, 2004) . Recently, the peptidases of Lactobacillus helveticus R211 and R389 have been found to generate casein-derived peptides that inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme and are active in vivo (Leclerc et al., 2001; Seppo et al., 2003) . The application of combinations of peptidases to hydrolyse collagen for cosmetic uses has also been developed (Shigeri et al., 2005) . In addition, thermostable highactivity aminopeptidases constitute alternatives for biotechnological applications such as the processing of recombinant proteins (Gilboa et al., 2001) .",
