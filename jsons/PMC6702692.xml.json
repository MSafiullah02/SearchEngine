Henipaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses and the rabies-causing lyssaviruses are all transmissible from bats to humans. These are often transmitted through an intermediate host, and the resulting human disease is frequently fatal. Bats harbour more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents and are recognized as a significant source of zoonotic agents12. The emergence of many zoonotic bat-borne viruses in Southeast Asia demonstrated the favourable conditions for such events3.",

Due to their special characteristics, Pteropus bats are a perfect reservoir for most of the recently emerging zoonotic pathogens. They often live in large colonies or roosts and travel long distances; thus, they are very effective in transmitting viruses among colony members and disseminating them over a considerable distance1. Interactions between Pteropus bats, humans and livestock are constantly increasing due to anthropogenic activities, thereby increasing the potential for virus spillover events. Deforestation in tropical areas has destroyed the natural habitats of these fruit bat species, forcing them to live in the vicinity of human settlements. The resulting close contact is responsible for the emergence of highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses, such as Hendra and Nipah virus (NiV), in human populations in Southeast Asia and Australia4.",
