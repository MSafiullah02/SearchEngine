Even though the case fatality rate for AP has decreased over time, the overall population mortality rate for AP has remained unchanged [3].Aetiological variation has been seen depending upon the lifestyle in different population.Generally, acute pancreatitis is more common in males than females. In males, the aetiology is more often related to alcohol; in females, it is more often related to biliary tract disease.The overall mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis is 10\u201315 %. Mortality due to biliary pancreatitis is high as compared to alcoholic pancreatitis. Twenty percent of patients present with severe disease (organ failure) in whom, mortality is approximately 30 % [4].\n",

Medication history should be asked to rule out drug induced AP.Apart from serum amylase and lipase, complete blood count including haematocrit, liver function test, serum triglyceride levels, serum calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum electrolytes should be checked to look for aetiology as well as to assess severity of AP.Serum triglyceride level of >1000 mg/dl is considered significant as a cause of AP in absence of gallstones and history of alcohol abuse.ECG \u2013 to rule out acute coronary syndrome.Chest x-ray erect view to look for air under diaphragm in case of intestinal perforation and also to aid to diagnosis of any pulmonary pathology, e.g. ARDS.In female patients under reproductive age group, bedside urine pregnancy card test should be done to rule out ectopic pregnancy.Transabdominal ultrasound should be done in all patients of AP to look for possible causes [17].In patients >40 years of age without any identifiable cause of AP, pancreatic tumours should be suspected as a probable cause [18, 19].Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen should be done only in patients in whom diagnosis is not certain or in those patients who do not show any signs of improvement within 48\u201372 h of hospital admission [20].\n",
