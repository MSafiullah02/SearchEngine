            "text": "Parvoviral enteritis (PVE) is a disease caused by parvovirus\u20102 (CPV\u20102) in dogs, which is a single\u2010chain, nonenveloped DNA virus (Crawford & Sellon, 2010). PVE is a viral disease that most commonly affects young, unvaccinated dogs younger than 6 months (Macintire & Smith\u2010Carr, 1997). Canine parvovirus\u20102 (CPV\u20102) is responsible for classic PVE, and there now are at least three identified strains (CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b, CPV 2c) (Willard, 2009). Rottweiler, Doberman pincher, American bull terrier, Labrador retriever and German shepherd dogs are known to be more sensitive (Crawford & Sellon, 2010). Dogs with PVE may either be asymptomatic or may die with severe clinical signs shortly. Virus attacks rapidly dividing cells (especially) the GI tract and bone marrow. Clinical signs often start with anorexia, lethargy, fever and progress within 1\u20132 days to vomitus and diarrhoea, which may be yellow, mucoid or haemorrhagic (Crawford & Sellon, 2010). Vomiting is usually prominent and may be severe enough to mimic foreign body obstruction and/or cause esophagitis (Willard, 2009). Large fluid and protein losses from vomiting and diarrhoea can cause severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock (Crawford & Sellon, 2010).",

            "text": "Fluid infusion is performed to prevent dehydration, antibacterial agent administration is performed to prevent secondary infections, and anti\u2010emetic agents are used to prevent vomiting. Dopaminergic D2 antagonist metoclopramide, serotonin antagonist ondansetron and NK\u20101 receptor antagonist maropitant may be used for preventing vomiting in dogs (Lenberg, Sullivan, Boscan, Hackett, & Twedt, 2012; Mantione & Otto, 2005; Willard, 2009). Metoclopramide is able to pass the blood\u2013brain barrier and prevents vomiting by its effect in the medulla spinalis region of the brain. Additionally, it has a prokinetic effect. Metoclopramide inhibits gastric relaxation induced by dopamine, thus enhancing the cholinergic responses of gastric smooth muscle to increase motility (Papich, 2011). It is commonly used in prevention of vomiting due to chemotherapy or PVE, and postoperatively in ileus. If gastrointestinal obstruction is considered, it should not be used as it increases gastric and intestinal motility (De La Puente\u2010Redondo et al., 2007; Elwood et al., 2010; Lamm & Rezabek, 2008; Willard, 2009). Ondansetron inhibits serotonin 5\u2010HT3 receptors and is used to prevent chemotherapy\u2010related nausea and vomiting by blocking emetic stimuli that release serotonin (Papich, 2011). It shows efficacy on the enteric neurons of the gastrointestinal system (GIS) and shows anti\u2010emetic effect via the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the brain. It also has been used to treat vomiting from other forms of gastroenteritis, pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease (Papich, 2011). It has no gastric or intestinal peristaltic increasing effect (Mantione & Otto, 2005; Prittie, 2004; Washabau & Elie, 1995).",

Maropitant is a potent and selective neurokinin\u20101 receptor antagonist, which acts in a dose\u2010dependent manner as an anti\u2010emetic by inhibiting the binding of substance P; therefore, it is effective against neural and humoral (central and peripheral) causes of vomiting.",

Vail, Rodabaugh, Conder, Boucher, and Mathur (2007) have reported that it was also effective in preventing cisplatin\u2010related vomiting in chemotherapy. Maropitant should be administered one hour before travelling to prevent travelling\u2010related vomiting (Benchaoui et al., 2007; Conder, Sedlacek, Boucher, & Clemence, 2008). Maropitant is not recommended in dogs younger than 8\u201316 weeks due to the risk of causing bone marrow hypoplasia (Benchaoui et al., 2007; Food and Drug Administration, 2007; Willard, 2009).",

Anti\u2010emetic drugs enable oral feeding of the patient shortly and minimize the fluid loss that triggers dehydration. Metoclopramide responds well as an anti\u2010emetic drug and is used conventionally, but it should be used every eight hours (Mantione & Otto, 2005; Willard, 2009; Prittie, 2004). Metoclopramide has both anti\u2010emetic and prokinetic properties, and this limits its usage in patients with invagination risk. Ondansetron, which is preferred in resistant vomiting and postchemotherapy by the veterinarians, is used 2\u20133 times a day. Its usage is limited as it may only be used intravenously. Maropitant, which is more recent in the market as oral and injectable (subcutaneous and recently licensed for intravenous administration), is used once a day effectively, but its efficacy in PVE is not known yet (Mantione & Otto, 2005; Ramsey et al., 2008; Vail et al., 2007; Watson et al., 1995). Use of maropitant may be limited due to its moderate bone marrow\u2010suppressive effect in dogs younger than 8 weeks (Food and Drug Administration, 2007) and less cost\u2010effective price than the other drugs. However, sufficient effect in once a day usage is its major advantage.",
