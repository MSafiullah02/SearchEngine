Findings 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups.",

A local outbreak of COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to cause a pandemic. 4 A key feature of the pandemic in all areas with large local epidemics is that healthcare systems are often rapidly overwhelmed. Effective and safe triage to ensure that those at highest risk of severe disease are appropriately escalated, and those at lower risk safely monitored, is critical to maintain healthcare system capacity for as long as possible. The same risk stratification is also needed to support targeted recruitment to both mechanistic and interventional research studies, since developing effective treatments of early disease is a key objective alongside vaccine development. Although risk stratification is important in all health systems, exactly how risk stratification is done will vary by country and by healthcare system. Across all systems though, important care pathway decision points include (1) who to test (particularly important when tests are in short supply); (2) who to hospitalize, and who to care for in the community (with or without telemonitoring or other proactive follow-up), and; (3) who to direct down different care pathways after admission. Since the severity of disease and risk of poor outcome varies by point on the pathway, there is a need for a range of risk stratification tools based on the data available at different stages of the care pathway (Figure 1 ), and/or in different healthcare systems.",

Zhou et al examined risk factors for inhospital death in 191 patients, finding significant adjusted associations with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, lower lymphocyte count and increased d-dimer. 16 Xie et al is the only published study explicitly aiming to create a risk prediction model for inpatient mortality for clinical use, with derivation in 299 patients admitted to one Wuhan hospital and external validation in 145 .

Using the two alternative probability cut-offs, the percentage of patients with poor outcome in the low, high, and very high-risk groups were 0.63% (n=2/320), 8.9% (n=25/280) and 58.5% (n=31/53), respectively ( Figure 2E-F) . Notably, the model defined a low-risk group comprising 49.0% of patients with very high negative predictive value (0.99) ( Table 3 ) as well as a very-high risk group comprising 8.1% of patients with high positive predictive value (0.60) in which 53% of observed poor outcomes occurred. Table 3 shows the performance (discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness) of the DL-Death and DL-Poor models without any re-calibration. Both models showed good discrimination measured by the C-index (death: 0.74; poor outcome: 0.72), but calibration was only fair with calibration-in-the-large 0.25 for death and 0.28 for poor outcome, and calibration slope 0.54 for death and 0.54 for poor outcome.",

In internal validation, DL model performance was good, and it was possible to define low, high and veryhigh risk groups for both outcomes. DL models were externally validated in a cohort of inpatients in London, UK with eight-fold higher risk of death (34.1%) and four-fold higher risk of poor outcome (42.9%) reflecting different care pathways in the two countries ( Figure 1 ) and therefore different casemix of those admitted (Table 1 ).

Third, the study is reported in accordance with the TRIPOD guidelines 17 including detailed methods reporting in the supplementary file to facilitate reproducibility and further external validation. 1 The study also has a number of limitations. First, the clinical datasets were collected when healthcare services were under severe strain. Data extraction sought to ensure consistency and accuracy, but was not blind to outcome, and there is missing data in both datasets. Second, the datasets used are smaller than ideal (although as large as or larger than previous studies), and there are relatively few deaths in particular. Our analytical approach aimed to minimise overfitting, but further research using larger, federated datasets is clearly required. Third, clinical assessments at admission such as SpO2 are likely to be important predictors of short-term outcome, 3 but were not available in either dataset. Fourth, our .

The findings of this and previous studies are consistent with demography and routinely available laboratory measurements being useful markers of prognosis at the time of hospital admission, indicating that simple risk prediction tools may usefully inform clinical decision-making at this point in the care pathway. However, COVID-19 risk prediction models need external validation before widespread clinical use, because severity and prognosis depends on the setting and system of care. Our Wuhan derivation cohort is closer to a general population cohort (mortality 4.3%) than either our validation cohort in London (mortality 34.1%) or the Wuhan cohorts in other studies (mortality 28.3%, 16 and 51.8% derivation and 47.6% validation 3 ). It may therefore be better suited to decisions about who to admit and who can safely be sent home to self-isolate (decision 2 in Figure 1 ) than to identifying those at highest risk of poor outcome and death in people with more severe disease, for example at the point of potential ICU admission. All proposed prediction models therefore require repeated external validation in multiple datasets to identify the contexts in which they can be most effectively deployed. The DCS and DL models are available as prediction tools in a web portal but we emphasise that they should be used with caution, particularly in settings with different rates of poor outcomes, and are not a replacement for clinical judgement (https://covid.datahelps.life/prediction/).",

For example, for Death DCS model, the OR for Death is 1\u00b706. This means that every 1 year increase in age is associated with a 6% increase in the odds of death (e.g. across the 18 year interquartile range of age, this equates to an OR of 2\u00b785).\u00b7\u00b7 indicates the corresponding predictor is not included in the model",
