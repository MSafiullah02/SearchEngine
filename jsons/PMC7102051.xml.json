            "text": "Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) comprising approximately 50% of all malignant bile duct tumors, is an intractable cancer [1], which requires a high level of expertise in hepatobiliary surgery due to the deep anatomical location of tumor [2, 3]. In addition, curative resection for HCCA is a complex procedure involving hepatectomy, lymphadenectomy, vascular resection and reconstruction, even pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) [4, 5]. Consequently, curative resection is a challenging surgery and carries with a considerable risk of mortality and severe postoperative morbidity [6, 7]. Undoubtedly, curative resection offers HCCA patients the only potential chance for long-term survival, but the rates of mortality and morbidity require further improvement [8]. Meanwhile, many definitive prognostic factors affecting the postoperative survival have not been identified and accepted by surgeons [9\u201313], despite majority investigations have focused on this field. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess the surgical management for HCCA and analyze potential factors influencing postoperative prognosis.",

With the approval of local institutional review board, we reviewed the medical records of all potential candidates for surgery. Seventy-four patients without any surgical interventions were excluded due to multiple metastasis, severe preoperative malnutrition, compromised liver function or severe involvement of contralateral major vessels. Therefore, curative-intent laparotomy was conducted in the remaining 142 patients. Consequently, 95 patients underwent curative resection (R0 resection) and 47 patients were performed with palliative resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27). All the 142 patients were enrolled into this study.",

Patients who were scheduled to accept major hepatectomy with preoperative serum total bilirubin over 11.70 mg/dL (200 \u03bcmol/L) were suggested with biliary drainage prior to surgery. None of patients underwent portal vein embolization (PVE). Percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) under ultrasound guidance was performed for 33 patients and 4 patients underwent endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD). When the surgical approach of extended hepatectomy was established preoperatively, three dimensional computed tomography (3-D CT) volumetry was applied to calculate the remnant liver in order to avoid hepatic failure postoperatively. Definitive surgery arrangement was carried out when preoperative serum total bilirubin level decreased to below 11.70 mg/dL (200 \u03bcmol/L), whereas those without biliary drainage were performed with surgery within 7 days.",

It has been increased from traditionally 30% to currently 49.2\u201395% [2, 9, 13]. Simultaneously, the median survival of HCCA has also been dramatically ameliorated. KY. Paik et al. [20] reported 5-year survival rate was 64.2% without any in-hospital death of 16 patients who underwent right trisectionectomy with caudate lobectomy. In the study of Shimizu et al. [21], the R0 rate was 63.6% for patients who underwent left-side hepatectomy and 5-year survival was 36.7% with median survival of 24.4 months. In addition, patients with type IV lesion were previously considered not suitable for surgery, which was documented by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging manual (7th, edition). However, a study of combined extended hepatectomy for those who with type IV from Jang et al. [22] indicated that median survival time was 16 months in curative resection group and 12 months in palliative resection group (P = 0.006). Consistent with the previous literatures, R0 resection rate of those who underwent combined with hepatectomy was 75% (69/92) in this series, which was higher than the overall curative resection rate of 66.9% (95/142). Furthermore, 67.86% (38/56) patients with type IV underwent curative resection with median survival time of 23 months, which was significantly better than that of 7 months with non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Although combined hepatectomy did not develop impacts on postoperative survival in our study (P = 0.302), we believed that combined hepatectomy was essential to obtain higher R0 resection rate and benefit selected HCCA patients.",

Although zero mortality rate after R0 resection for HCCA has been achieved by Sano et al. with preoperative biliary drainage routinely applied [13], multivariate analysis of their study also revealed preoperative cholangitis was associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity. In this study, patients who were scheduled to undergo major hepatectomy with preoperative serum total bilirubin over 11.70 mg/dL (200 \u03bcmol/L) were suggested with biliary drainage prior to surgery. Consequently, patients with preoperative serum total bilirubin below 10 mg/dL obtained apparent survival benefits than those with that above 10 mg/dL (20 vs 14 months, P = 0.003). Additionally, preoperative biliary drainage trends to result in bile duct infections, even delay treatment [29]. Therefore, to obtain the better outcomes of surgery, preoperative biliary drainage should be a selective procedure which is depended on preoperative definitive serum total bilirubin level and scheduled surgical policy.",

Hepatitis and tumor thrombi regarded as potential prognostic factors were seldom discussed. To our knowledge, only a few studies have described the role of hepatitis virus infection for HCCA. In the study of Abdel Wahab M et al. [30], the median survival of patients with HCV infection was shorter than that of non-hepatitis virus infection patients (P = 0.005) and multivariate analysis confirmed that it was an independent prognostic factor. On the contrary, we failed to note that viral infection such as HBVor HCV has negative effect on postoperative prognosis of HCCA (16 vs 20 months, P = 0.528). Perhaps, the low morbidity of hepatitis (16/142) in this study was accounted for this discrepancy. Of course, the significance of hepatitis viral infection has remained uncertain and should be further explored. As for tumor thrombi, few reports concerned can be traced in recent literatures. In this study, the pathological examination revealed 19 patients with tumor thrombi invasion. As a result, the median survival time with pathological tumor thrombi invasion was 16 months, comparing with 17 months in absence of tumor thrombi invasion (P = 0.378). With the limitation of small sample, we could not confirm that whether the poor survival was associated with tumor thrombi invasion. Even so, tumor thrombi as an interesting factor deserves further exploration.",
