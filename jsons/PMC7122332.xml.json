Failure of alveolar macrophages to mount an effective early\nresponse is associated with increased viral dissemination and increased morbidity/mortality. Neutrophils are also early responders\nin severe influenza infection. Similar to alveolar macrophages, failure of this early neutrophil response is a prominent feature\nof severe influenza infection. Paradoxically, an exuberant or inappropriately exaggerated neutrophil response is also a feature of\nsevere influenza infection. For example, in severe H1N1 and H5N1 infection, the large influx of neutrophils into the alveolar\nspace is a classic feature [1]. During this massive neutrophil influx, the neutrophils\nrelease a large amount of cytokines, extracellular proteases and histones. This leads to a breakdown of the epithelial barrier,\naccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), flooding of alveolar spaces by inflammatory fluid and increased barrier to\noxygenation, all of which contribute to the clinical picture of acute lung injury commonly observed in patients with severe\ninfluenza infection.",

However, a recent review demonstrated that such assays have an unacceptably low\nsensitivity [7]. Nucleic acid amplification (e. g., multiplex viral polymerase chain\nreaction [PCR]) has recently gained a much greater prominence due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Currently, this is the\nmost accepted gold standard for virus detection in the initial evaluation of suspected influenza infection. However, there are\nthree important caveats regarding the clinical utility of nucleic acid amplification assay:\nThe reliability of such an assay is dependent on the fact that the viral genome is known. An unknown viral\ngenome, mutant strain or new pandemic influenza virus will be difficult to detect.The sensitivity is affected by the way the sample is collected. Poor sample collection, inability to access\nlower airway or reduced virus shedding (due to prior anti\u2010viral administration) all reduce detection\nsensitivity.Detection does not imply infection because the presence of influenza virus in the upper airway may be\na co\u2010incidental finding or active infection. In fact, 18% of exposed individuals show no clinical symptoms; therefore, the\npresence of the virus does not always imply that it is the causative agent. Furthermore, detection of an incomplete virus\nsegment (by nucleic acid amplification) does not constitute sufficient proof that active viral replication is\npresent.\nIn addition to virus detection, clinicians need to identify which patients are more likely to progress to severe disease or\nrequire admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Table 1 summarizes virus\u2010related and\nhost factors that may contribute to progression to more severe disease. Some of these factors are clinically obvious (e. g.,\nage, pre\u2010existing medical conditions). Other factors (e. g., genetic susceptibility) require highly sophisticated laboratory\ntesting (e. g., high\u2010throughput genome sequencing), which are not yet available in the routine clinical setting.",

The causative bacterial\nco\u2010pathogens are most likely to be Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. The basis for increased susceptibility is thought to be due to production of\ntype I interferon, which is increased initially in response to influenza virus infection, but also decreases the synthesis of\nIL\u20101B, IL\u201023, IL\u201017 and IL\u201022, which in turn inhibit the production of antimicrobial peptides [9].

A recently\npublished landmark study showed that these biomarkers could address several important clinical questions simultaneously (whereas\nconventional biomarkers could address only one question at a time) [10]. First, these\nbiomarkers could assist clinicians to identify patients most likely to have infection (bacterial and viral) in a heterogeneous\npopulation of patients with undifferentiated respiratory illnesses. Second, among infected patients, the biomarkers could\ndistinguish between bacterial and viral infection. Third, among infected patients, the biomarkers could prognosticate and predict\nclinical outcomes. In addition, the biomarkers could be easily measured in most clinical settings due to the ease of sampling\n(only 2.5 ml of whole blood is required) and the wide availability of PCR machines (to measure gene\u2010expression). Importantly,\nbecause these biomarkers reflect changes in the immune pathway during influenza infection, they provide additional diagnostic\ninformation not offered by conventional pathogen detection assay (e. g., virus nucleic amplification).

In plasmacytoid dendritic\ncells, TLR7 activation produces massive interferon release at 1,000 times that of any other immune cell in the human host.

This enzyme\nis located in the human airway epithelium and plays an important role in permitting influenza virus to gain entry into\nthe host cell. Consequently, a protease inhibitor that binds to the TMPRSS molecule is a potential drug target in the\ntreatment of influenza infection. Recent studies have identified three TMPRSS molecules, namely TMPRSS2,\nTMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D, as potential drug targets [21].

In addition to reducing viral replication, aprotinin has also been shown to reduce\ninflammatory cytokines, suggesting a further benefit other than its impact on viral replication. So far, findings with\nthe TMPRSS molecule have been derived mainly from in vitro models. Further studies in\nanimal models and human clinical trials are needed in the future.",
