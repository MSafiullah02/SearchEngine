Stress ECG and myocardial perfusion imaging were normal and CT for attenuation correction (CTAC) showed no coronary calcifications. However, the CTAC demonstrated abnormal pulmonary patchy ground glass opacities (GGOs) in the bilateral lower lobes that have been described in patients infected with novel COVID-19 infection ( Figure 1) .",
