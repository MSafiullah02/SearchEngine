            "text": "Peptide with C-terminal aldehyde is of interest due to its property as a transition-state analogue toward numerous classes of proteolytic enzymes; aspartyl1, 2 and cysteine protease3, 4 are inhibited by peptide aldehyde. Since leupeptin5 is produced by actinomycetes, which inhibit a variety of proteases potently, natural peptide aldehydes6 are attractive targets for drug discovery. Peptide aldehyde can also be used as a key intermediate in the syntheses of pseudo-peptides, particularly in the synthesis of reduced peptide by reduced fragment condensation. Several methods for solid phase synthesis of peptide aldehyde have been reported: reduction of Weinreb amide,7, 8 oxidation of alcohol,9 or ozonolysis10, 11 of the corresponding olefin. However Weinreb amides and ozonolysis are limited to peptide aldehydes without reductant or oxidant labile amino acid sequences. On the other hand, acetal linker,12, 13 oxazoline linker,14, 15 threonine-type linker,16 and semicarbazone linker17 were developed for the attachment of aldehydes. Cleavage of the peptide aldehydes from these linkers required strong acidic conditions, HF, TFA, or AcOH, and so forth, which frequently caused serious problems. In the course of our research regarding cysteine protease inhibitors,18 we prepared several peptide aldehydes via a thioacetal structure on a solid support since the aldehyde group seems to be effective for the thiol functional group of cysteine protease.19 At that time, we found that the conversion of an acetal to an aldehyde was quite slow but that the thioacetal can be efficiently converted into the desired aldehyde by treatment with N-bromo succinimide (NBS). In this case, the Fmoc-His(Trt)-H and decane-1,2,10-triol linker12 were selected and peptide aldehydes with a histidine residue at the P1 position were prepared using solid phase synthesis. Subsequently, we discovered a tetrapeptide with C-terminal aldehyde with potent inhibitory activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like protease.20 Herein, we report a practical synthetic route for the preparation of several peptide aldehydes with different amino acids and commercially available linkers on a solid support.",

Although the acetal linker using decane-1,2,10-triol reported by Yao and Xu12 is stable and useful for solid phase peptide synthesis, decane-1,2,10-triol is not commercially available and the acetal is stable in TFA. When the resin was treated with 95% TFA/H2O, the desired peptide aldehyde was obtained in poor yield.12 We thought that the peptide acetal (B), which was converted from the amino acetal (A) containing commercially available alkyl triols by solid phase peptide synthesis, transformed peptide thioacetal (C) by treatment with EtSH in the presence of catalytic Lewis acid. As a final step, the thioacetal (C) thus obtained could be treated with NBS in 10% CH2Cl2 aq to give the desired peptide aldehyde (D). In addition, N-terminal protection was necessary to avoid the (hemi-) aminal formation between N-terminal amine and C-terminal aldehyde otherwise complexed mixtures were given (Scheme 1\n).",

After the conventional Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis of 4 using diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole coupling and Fmoc deprotection by 20% piperidine/DMF, the treatment of resin (5) with 95% TFA gave the desired peptide aldehyde, Ac-Val-Leu-Ala-H (6) and acetal carboxylic acid (7) in 8% and 32% yields, respectively. We found that the acetal carboxylic acid (7) was smoothly converted to thioacetal (8) in 68% yield by treatment with 10 equiv of EtSH and catalytic BF3\u2013Et2O for several minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, peptide aldehyde (6) was quickly obtained from thioacetal (8) by NBS in 10% CH2Cl2 aq in 85% yield. These results suggested that the cheap hexane-1,2,6-triol linker compared favorably with Yao\u2019s octane-1,2,10-triol linker and, furthermore, it was possible to convert acetal to thioacetal quickly. On the other hand, acetal (3c) oxidized from 2c was attempted to give 6 using the above protocol, which had similar results, giving the corresponding peptide aldehyde (6) in poor yield. TFA-mediated cleavage process from the resin with 3c afforded the trace amount of 6 with the corresponding acetal carboxylic acid (\u223c10%). Although each reaction via thiacetal (8) for the desired 6 proceeded to give the corresponding compounds, conversion of acetal to thioacetal with EtSH and catalytic BF3\u2013Et2O was extremely slow because of the steric hindrance of acetal composed of trimethylolethane. For this reason, we selected the hexane-1,2,6-triol linker for the synthesis of other sequences (Scheme 2\n).",

Peptide acetals were efficiently converted to thioacetal structures followed by treatment of NBS to give peptide C-terminal aldehydes. Although it is difficult to apply this procedure to Trp/Cys-containing peptides, general scope and limitations using several amino acids are now underway.",
