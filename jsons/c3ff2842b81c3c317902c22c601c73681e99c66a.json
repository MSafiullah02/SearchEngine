A sharp increase in the trend has been observed from 10th march to 10th April 2020. The Google trend can be further mined to determine the least and most infected regions of the countries. To avoid the massive increase of psychological disorders, there is a need to access the mental state of COVID-19 afflicted individuals [5] . Based upon the high wave of interest in the regions, the semantic analysis of the searches can be carried out to find the prevalence of psychological impacts and the need of psychological intervention (behaviour and cognitive) for mental health problems during and after this pandemic. This would help in delivering therapeutic assistance to improve psychological resilience and to boost immunity of the COVID afflicted, suspected and infected victims [6] . ",
