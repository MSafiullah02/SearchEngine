Several concepts of mathematical epidemiology\u2014like the basic reproductive number or core groups [1\u20133]\u2014have entered the vocabulary of medical scientists. Traditionally, authors have modeled disease outbreaks in society by assuming any person to have the same chance of meeting anyone else at any time. This is of course not realistic, and improving this point is the motivation for network epidemiology: epidemic simulations between people connected by a network [4]. One can continue increasing the realism in the contact patterns by observing that the timing of contacts can also have structures capable of affecting the disease. Studying epidemics on time-varying contact structures is the basis of the emerging field of temporal network epidemiology [5\u20138].",

It depends on the particular scenario one considers and the means of interventions at hand. If the goal for society is to detect as many outbreaks as possible, it makes sense to choose sentinels to maximize the fraction of detected outbreaks [9]. If the objective rather is to discover outbreaks early, then one could choose sentinels that, if infected, are infected early [10,12]. Finally, if the objective is to stop the disease as early as possible, it makes sense to measure the time to extinction or detection (infection of a sentinel) [13]. See Fig. 1 for an illustration. To restrict ourselves, we will focus on the case of one sentinel. If one has more than one sentinel, the optimal set will most likely not be the top nodes of a ranking according to the three measures above. Their relative positions in the network also matter (they should not be too close to each other) [13].\n",

We analyze them both in temporal and static networks. The reason we use empirical contact data, rather than generative models, as the basis of this study is twofold. First, there are so many possible structures and correlations in temporal networks that one cannot tune them all in models [8]. It is also hard to identify the most important structures for a specific spreading phenomenon [8]. Second, studying empirical networks makes this paper\u2014in addition to elucidating the objective measures of sentinel surveillance\u2014a study of human interaction. We can classify data sets with respect how the epidemic dynamics propagate on them. As mentioned above, in practical sentinel surveillance, the network in question is rather one of hospitals, clinics or farms. One can, however, also think of sentinel surveillance of individuals, where high-risk individuals would be tested extra often for some diseases.",

            "text": "There are many possible ways to reduce our empirical temporal networks to static networks. The simplest method would be to just include a link between any pair of nodes that has at least one contact during the course of the data set. This would however make some of the networks so dense that the static network structure of the node-pairs most actively in contact would be obscured. For our purpose, we primarily want our network to span many types of network structures that can impact epidemics. Without any additional knowledge about the epidemics, the best option is to threshold the weighted graph where an edge (i,j) means that i and j had more than \u03b8 contacts in the data set. In this work, we assume that we do not know what the per-contact transmission probability \u03b2 is (this would anyway depend on both the disease and precise details of the interaction). Rather we scan through a very large range of \u03b2 values. Since we anyway to that, there is no need either to base the choice of \u03b8 on some epidemiological argument, or to rescale \u03b2 after the thresholding. Note that the rescaled \u03b2 would be a non-linear function of the number of contacts between i and j. (Assuming no recovery, for an isolated link with \u03bd contacts, the transmission probability is 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03bd.) For our purpose the only thing we need is that the rescaled \u03b2 is a monotonous function of \u03b2 for the temporal network (which is true). To follow a simple principle, we omit all links with a weight less than the median weight \u03b8.",

For static networks, we use the standard Markovian version of the SIR model [15]. That is, we assume that diseases spread over links between susceptible and infectious nodes the infinitesimal time interval dt with a probability \u03b2dt. Then, an infectious node recovers after a time that is exponentially distributed with average 1/\u03bd. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03bd are called infection rate and recovery rate, respectively. We can, without loss of generality, put \u03bd=1/T (where T is the duration of the sampling). For other \u03bd values, the ranking of the nodes would be the same (but the values of the tx and td would be rescaled by a factor \u03bd). We will scan an exponentially increasing progression of 200 values of \u03b2, from 10\u22123 to 10. The code for the disease simulations can be downloaded [16].",

In the Romania data, the WiFi channel of smartphones was used to log the proximity between university students [30], whereas the WiFi dataset links students of a Chinese university that are logged onto the same WiFi router. For the Diary data set, a group of colleagues and their family members were self-recording their contacts [31]. Our final proximity data, the Prostitution network, comes from from self-reported sexual contacts between female sex workers and their male sex buyers [32]. This is a special form of proximity network since contacts represent more than just proximity.",

This is because tx is a quantity one wants to minimize to find the optimal sentinel, whereas for all the structural descriptors a large value means that a node is a candidate sentinel node. We see that degree and subgraph centrality are the two quantities that best predict the optimal sentinel location, while coreness is also close (at around \u22120.65). This in line with research showing that certain biological problems are better determined by degree than more elaborate centrality measures [51]. Over all, the \u03c4 curves are rather flat.

This anticorrelation is a special feature of this particular data set, perhaps due to its pronounced community structure. Nodes of degree 0, 1, and 2 have a strictly increasing values of fd, but for some of the high degree nodes (that all have fd close to one) the ordering gets anticorrelated with degree which makes Kendall's \u03c4 negative.

Furthermore, there are some striking patterns:\n(1)Degree is the strongest structural determinant of all objective measures at low \u03b2 values. This is consistent with Ref. [13].(2)Component size only occurs for large \u03b2. In the limit of large \u03b2, fd is only determined by component size (if we would extend the analysis to even larger \u03b2, subgraph centrality would have the strongest correlation for the frequency of detection).(3)Harmonic vitality is relatively better as a structural descriptor for td, less so for tx and fd. tx and fd capture the ability of detecting an outbreak before it dies, so for these quantities one can imagine more fundamental quantities like degree and the component size are more important.(4)Subgraph centrality often shows the strongest correlation for intermediate values of \u03b2. This is interesting, but difficult to explain since the rationale of subgraph centrality builds on cycle counts and there is no direct process involving cycles in the SIR model.(5)Harmonic closeness rarely gives the strongest correlation. If it does, it is usually succeeded by coreness and the data set is typically rather large.(6)Datasets from the same category can give different results.
