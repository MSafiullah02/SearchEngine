I argue that a microlevel perspective assists in making connections between two dominant streams in the literature on government-CSO relations: an empirical-analytical stream and a critical stream. It aims to better understand the interactions and relations, by analysing the institutional work done by CSOs' members. Adopting this approach puts CSO members in a more agentic position. Interactional processes are brought to the centre of analysis. The Dutch Community Sport Coach programme was used as a case to illustrate the usefulness of the approach. Through a one-year organizational ethnography, the article scrutinizes the way in which members of one CSO enact the organization's service delivery relationship with a municipality. Through a multidimensional perspective on agency, the analysis shows how individual CSO members act as embedded agents that assimilate a public logic into the dominant community logic. It further shows the CSO's members efforts and struggle to maintain their community logic.

First, state-civil society interactions have meaningful consequences for CSOs members' identity (Chen 2009; Neilson 2009; Kreutzer and J\u00e4ger 2011) . Members in mutual support organizations seem to be encouraged to take responsibility for a broader, non-member audience (Ilcan and Basok 2004; Waardenburg and van de Bovenkamp 2014 ). Yet, the initial commitment of most volunteers is oriented internally, to the CSO's own members. In addition, members of mutual support organizations could well see more value in their original community-driven activities, rather than new service delivery responsibilities. How do they align these diverging values and identities? Second, statecivil society cooperation might constitute an organizational paradox (Vangen 2017; Miron-Spektor et al. 2018) . For instance, the primary existence of many social movements is an oppositional stance towards state agencies. NGOs position themselves often as agents that challenge the state, pressing for social, environmental, or political change (Mercer 2002; Neilson 2009 ). How do NGO representatives uphold constructive microlevel relationships with state representatives, while simultaneously pressing for governmental change? Third, the literature on government-CSO interactions has predominantly put governments on the dominant side of the relationship and consequently focusing on the negative impact the out-of-balance relationship has on CSOs (e.g. Froelich 1999; Geoghegan and Powell 2006; Skokova et al. 2018 ).

In the Netherlands, as well as in other North West European countries, local governments increasingly use VSCs as partners for contributing to public issues, like counteracting children's overweight and obesity, promoting social integration of newcomers or people with disabilities, improving social cohesion in neighbourhoods, activating the elderly and developing basic skills of democracy (Albrecht et al. 2019; Ibsen and Levinsen 2019; Jaitner 2019; Waardenburg 2016) . Other types of CSOs are dealing with comparable service provision activities.

Societal problems were too complex and governments' steering power too weak. The traditional view, in which the government is regarded as a controlling and regulatory organization that enables the functioning of society, increasingly appeared to be outdated (Peters and Pierre 1998) . New Public Management arrived as the dominant praxis in administrative behavior. This implied that social welfare regimes gradually released their hierarchical role in policy fields from the 1980s onward to make way for a more market-oriented government. This can be seen, inter alia, in the privatization of large state enterprises and, for example, involving CSOs in policy formation and implementation. Later, a network approach in which public and private parties cooperate on societal challenges became the dominant modus operandi (Osborne 2010; Pestoff et al. 2012 ). These changes resulted in an increase in cooperative relationships between government actors and CSOs, which is expressed in terms of outsourcing, service provision, and co-production (Osborne et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 419, "text": "(Peters and Pierre 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 958, "end": 972, "text": "(Osborne 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 973, "end": 992, "text": "Pestoff et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1201, "text": "(Osborne et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Government-Civil Society Organisations Interactions"}, {"text": "The associated change in orientations within associations is not without consequences. Brandsen et al. (2014) found that cooperation between civil society and government in providing public services has led for many CSOs to a loss of contact with the traditional membership base and, consequently, their original legitimacy. CSOs gain that legitimacy, especially from below and from the inside, from its association members. But as an executive of public duties, associations might derive their legitimacy increasingly from the above and outside of the organization. Consequences are diverse. For patient associations, Van de Bovenkamp and Trappenburg (2011) found that their ideology, organizational structure, and activities changed as a result of closer links with national government. Smith and Lipsky (2009) note for non-profits that closer links with governments can lead, among other things, to more homogeneous services, thus reducing choices for citizens. In addition, Froelich (1999) argues that closer financial ties with the government can lead to a goal shift or the influx of a new clientele. Harris (2010, p. 35) has argued that CSOs 'find themselves under pressure to change their operating systems and structures so that they complement those of more powerful partners'. This also links to the debate on managerialism in civil society studies (Claey\u00e9 and Jackson 2012; Hvenmark 2016; Kreutzer and J\u00e4ger 2011; Willner 2019) .

The intentions behind institutional work that have been discerned to date are the creation, maintenance, and disruption of institutions (Lawrence and Suddaby 2006; Lawrence et al. 2011 ). Lawrence and Suddaby (2006) therefore defined institutional work as 'the purposive action of individuals and organizations aimed at creating, maintaining and disrupting institutions ' (2006: 215) . It is because of this intentional and active position of organizational actors that the concept of agency is central to IWA. Battilana and D'Aunno (2009: 46) define agency as 'an actor's engagement with the social world that, through the interplay of habit, imagination and judgement, can both reproduce and transform an environment's structures'. This definition is based on a multidimensional view of agency by Emirbayer and Mische (1998, in Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013) . They distinguish three dimensions of agency. These are iteration (habit), projection (imagination), and practical evaluation (judgment) (Battilana and D'Aunno 2009; Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013) . Iteration focuses on the past and describes the selective reactivation of patterns of meanings and actions by actors, bringing stability and order to the social world and helping to preserve identities, interactions, and institutions through time (Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013: 1174) . The projective dimension refers to 'the imaginative generation by actors of possible future trajectories of action, in which received structures of thought and action may be creatively reconfigured in relation to actors' hopes, fears and desires for the future' (Emirbayer and Mische 1998: 971; in Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013: 1174) .

This finding is in line with existing literature on VSCs as policy implementers, highlighting an implementation challenge due to the competitive orientation of most VSCs (Ibsen and Levinsen 2019; Skille 2011; Stenling and Fahl\u00e9n 2009; Waardenburg and Nagel 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 50, "end": 77, "text": "(Emirbayer and Mische 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 386, "end": 404, "text": "Meyer et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 405, "end": 417, "text": "Skille 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 418, "end": 443, "text": "Stenling and Fahl\u00e9n 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 616, "end": 635, "text": "(Meyer et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1300, "text": "(Waardenburg 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1688, "text": "(Ibsen and Levinsen 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1701, "text": "Skille 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1727, "text": "Stenling and Fahl\u00e9n 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1755, "text": "Waardenburg and Nagel 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another observation is that this form of assimilation of a public logic into a community logic also presumes institutional change (Skelcher and Smith 2015; Thornton et al. 2012) ; in the end, service delivery has been assimilated as a symbol and as a practice into the sport clubs' dominant community logic. Service provision has by now become part of the vocabularies and the activities of many CSOs (Brandsen and Pestoff 2006; McMullin and Skelcher 2018) . From an institutional work approach, this can be interpreted as practice work; change occurs in the legitimized practices of CSOs. Through practice work, the studied CSO assimilates elements of a public logic, thereby maintaining a community logic. These findings correspond with the observation that plural logics can coexist alongside each other (Besharov and Smith 2014; Kraatz and Block 2008; Skelcher and Smith 2015; Skirstad and Chelladurai 2011) .

Previous studies predominantly describe this relationship as unidirectional. When CSOs become involved in service delivery, expectations about their managerial ability rise. Thus, managerialism has often been addressed as a consequence of adopting a role as service provider by CSOs (Cairns et al. 2005; Harris 2010 ). The case analysis shows another possible connection that managerialism in a CSO triggers the openness to and adoption of a service delivery role. An important reason for CSOs to cooperate with government for service provision is securing strategic resources and increasing goodwill (Sowa 2009; Willner 2019) . While the studied CSO is not financially dependent on the municipality, members evaluate subsidies as a possibility to finance the professionalization of their association. Government subsidies are perceived as an alternative financial model to realize the appointment of a club manager. Governments and commercial activities increasingly provide possibilities for financing the professionalization of VSCs. Studies into other types of CSOs show that the professionalization of the association through paid professionals could put VSCs for new financial and other organizational challenges (Billis 2010; Cairns et al. 2005) . According to Billis (2010), taking on the first paid staff should be seen as a form of shallow hybridity. Often such modest hybridity arises from the desire to extend the range of activities. Public instruments and activities thus form an instrument for CSOs to position themselves vis-\u00e0-vis external stakeholders. The findings of this study suggest that the agentic position towards this public logic delineates the specific form (e.g. segregating, assimilating, blending) the process of hybridization takes (see also McMullin and Skelcher 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 393, "end": 413, "text": "(Cairns et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 414, "end": 425, "text": "Harris 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 711, "end": 722, "text": "(Sowa 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 723, "end": 736, "text": "Willner 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1362, "text": "Cairns et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1911, "text": "McMullin and Skelcher 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, seeking cooperation with state actors bears the risk of government co-optation (Najam 2000) .

Thus, what was observed in the case study cannot readily be transferred to other sports clubs or CSOs without careful consideration of those organizational contexts. A second limitation is that the case revolves around a specific policy instrument, the Community Sport Coach. As such, the case study was limited to those persons that were most directly involved with deciding on and implementing this policy instrument and related services, and not the whole membership base of the club. This may have decreased the possibility of generating a broad range of experiences and could have added another layer of understanding why professionalization, competitiveness, and managerialism are such strong forces in the organization. Another limitation of the study is the context of the voluntary sport sector, with its relatively strong focus on competitiveness. This field-specific dominant logic in sports could mean that other civil society sectors might be less able to maintain a community logic.

Such research might be based on similar in depth single case studies, multiple single sector case studies, or comparative multiple sector case studies. All types of case study design have the ability to tighten our grip on the microfoundations of governmentcivil society interactions.

Whilst the chosen timeframe for this study provides sufficient depth for our current conclusions, it remains to be seen how the studied relationship further develops, especially when public policy objectives and/or instruments change over time.
