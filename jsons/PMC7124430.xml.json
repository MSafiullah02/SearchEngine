Local medical authorities adopted specific WHO recommendations to identify and isolate suspected cases of COVID-19.3, 4 Such recommendations were addressed to patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and who had travelled to an endemic area in the previous 14 days or who had worked in the health-care sector, having been in close contact with patients with severe respiratory disease with unknown aetiology.
