Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at subcodon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3' untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes.",

IBV infects primarily the epithelial cells of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, though infections can also spread to the alimentary canal, as well as to the kidneys, testes and oviduct (Cavanagh, 2007) . The monopartite, polycistronic genomic RNA (gRNA) of IBV is approximately 28 kb in length, and -like those of other coronaviruses -it is 5\u2032-methyl-capped and 3\u2032-polyadenylated (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . Two large open reading frames (ORFs) -ORF1a and ORF1b -are situated within the 5\u2032-proximal twothirds of the genome. Translation of the former yields a ca. 3,950-aa polyprotein (pp1a); whereas translation of the latter requires \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (Brierley et al., 1987; 1989) giving rise to a ca. 6,630-aa polyprotein (pp1ab).

The RNASeq read coverage in the library derived from the second biological repeat of M41-CK-infected cells was lower than that of other libraries due to technical losses. However, 106,741 reads were mapped to the forward strand of the viral gRNA in this case -corresponding to a coverage of approximately 3.8-fold -and these reads were generally evenly distributed along the gRNA; hence, the sequencing depth in this replicate was deemed sufficient for further analysis. The vast majority of RPFs mapping to viral and host protein-coding regions were between 27 and 29 nt in length (Supp. Fig. S1 ), consistent with the size of the RNA fragment protected by translating eukaryotic ribosomes from digestion by RNase I (Wolin and Walter, 1988) . The length distributions of RNASeq reads were much broader, in line with the size of the gel slice excised for sequencing of fragmented RNA. RPF length was strongly related to the RPF phase relative to the reading frame of the associated coding region: 27-nt RPFs were primarily in the +1 phase; whereas 28-and 29-nt RPFs were primarily in the 0 phase (Supp. Fig. S2 ). As expected, RNASeq reads were far more evenly split over the three phases, with a slight bias towards phase 0 (Supp. Fig. S3 ), which may reflect codon usage bias -such as a preference for the use of RNY codons (Jukes, 1996; Fuchs et al., 2015; Irigoyen et al., 2016) -compounded with adaptor-ligation bias during library preparation.",

No protein-coding genes are annotated here but two putative AUG-initiated ORFs are present in each virus, referred to as ORF4b and ORF4c, after their homologs in turkey coronavirus [TCoV] (Gomaa et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2008) and in the genomes of most IBV isolates (Reddy et al., 2015) . Fig. S9 ). Thus, in Beaudette, the two ORFs are separated by a 3-nt spacer region and in the same reading frame (Fig. 4A) ; whereas in M41, ORF4c is located entirely within the ORF4b gene and in the +1 phase (Fig. 4B) . Inspection of the ribosomal profiling datasets reveals substantial RPF coverage of both ORF4b and ORF4c, providing the first clear illustration that ORFs 4b and 4c are ribosomally occupied (Fig. 4) . Visualisation of ORF4c translation in M41 was facilitated by good phasing in the datasets, allowing expression of both ORF4b and ORF4c to be visualised (as both blue and orange RPF peaks in the overlap region). Previous work (Bentley et al., 2013) has shown that a non-canonical TRS-B sequence -situated approximately 100 nt upstream of the M gene termination codon -facilitates production of a sgmRNA that harbours ORF4b at its 5\u2032 end, and this TRS-B was also identified in our RNASeq data.",

The TE of each ORF was measured as the quotient of the RPF density and the abundance of the corresponding mRNA; with separate calculations performed using the decumulated RNASeq densities and the TRS chimeric reads counts ( Fig. 5 and Supp. Fig. S10 , respectively). In the case of ORF4b and ORF4c, transcript abundance could not be accurately deduced via the RNASeq decumulation procedure, because the significantly lower level of expression of the 4b/4c transcript relative to that of the 5\u2032-adjacent M gene ( Fig. 1 ) was associated with a proportionate increase in the level of noise. Similarly, as a result of the high abundance of gRNA relative to the sgmRNA encoding S, the decumulated RNASeq density for the latter is likely to be poorly estimated, and therefore the TE value for S calculated using the chimeric read count is likely to be more accurate.",

            "text": "From this analysis, it was observed that the 4b gene is more efficiently translated than the 4c gene; a trend also observed for the accessory genes 3a/3b and 5a/5b (Fig. 5) . This is consistent with the likely requirement for leaky scanning to access the downstream ORF on each sgmRNA (see Discussion) . Surprisingly, despite the fact that the nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant viral protein, it was not found to be efficiently translated relative to the other structural proteins, regardless of the approach used to estimate transcript abundance ( Fig. 5; Supp. Fig. S10 ). In the case of the ORF1a and ORF1b genes, a large proportion of the genomic RNA is expected to be destined for packaging rather than translation, as mentioned above, and this probably explains the low TE values calculated for these genes ( Fig. 5; Supp. Fig. S10) . Additionally, the short length of the dORF precluded an accurate assessment of its translation efficiency. Inspection of the profiling datasets revealed a number of genomic locations where RPFs accumulated to a much higher level than at neighbouring sites, indicative of ribosomal pausing. As such pauses may have biological significance, we first sought to discount those that may have arisen artefactually. The known translation initiation sites in the virus genome generally showed high ribosome occupancy, but as the infected cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) prior to lysis to \"freeze\" ribosomes onto the mRNA, these pauses are likely to be over-represented, as ribosomes can accumulate at start codons during the CHX treatment period (Ingolia et al., 2011) . Fluctuations in RPF density can also occur as a result of nuclease, ligation, and PCR biases during library construction. As the latter two biases can also occur during RNASeq library generation, we also discounted any pauses that had an obvious counterpart in RNASeq datasets. With these criteria, we identified five obvious sites of ribosomal pausing conserved in Beaudette and M41, one in the 5\u2032 UTR and four within the coding region (indicated in Fig. 1 , purple triangles; see Table 1 ). Pauses in 5\u2032 UTRs can represent ribosomes initiating at upstream ORFs (uORFs), although in both Beaudette and M41, the P-site of the ribosome paused over bases 28-56 in the 5\u2032 UTR of the genome is on a non-AUG codon (UUG) in a weak Kozak initiation consensus. As this pause is located upstream of the TRS_L, it reflects the sum of pausing on all sgmRNAs. To view the extent of the pause in context, we remapped reads to the most abundant sgmRNA, i.e. that of the N gene (Fig. 6) . As can be seen, the \"Leader pause\" remains clearly evident (as is a smaller pause three codons downstream), albeit smaller in magnitude than those pauses seen at an N uORF (see below) and the authentic AUG codon of the N protein. Initiation at the UUG codon would result in translation of solely a dipeptide and thus the pause, if biologically relevant, may act as a regulator of downstream initiation events rather than through the encoded product. We note that an equivalent Leader pause is seen in MHV (UUG codon, 1-codon ORF; Irigoyen et al., 2016) . It is possible that pausing at this codon is potentiated by queueing of initiating ribosomes on sgmRNAs. The origin of the pauses Table 1 correspond to translation of a region of non-structural protein 4 (nsP4) downstream of the membrane spanning domains (Oostra et al., 2007; Doyle et al., 2018) . It is feasible that ribosomes pause here whilst the nascent peptide is being folded into membranes. Pauses 3 and 4 are noticeably large and correspond to ribosomes pausing soon after initiation of the S and M proteins, respectively. In the case of the former, the pause appears to be unrelated to the signal sequence at the N-terminus of the S protein, since this would still be within the peptide exit tunnel of paused ribosomes. Pause 5 corresponds to a potential non-AUG uORF (AUU, in a reasonable context) within the N mRNA (Fig. 6) .",

Overall immune-related pathways were among the most significantly enriched terms in the core response sets ( Fig. 7B and Fig. 7C ). There was also evidence of integration and coordination of responses at the transcriptional and translational levels.

Analysis of RNASeq data sets through chimeric read analysis or decumulation allowed us to quantify the relative levels of viral genomic and subgenomic mRNAs and to define the sequence diversity of strain-specific TRS utilisation. The predominant sgmRNA in both strains was that encoding the N protein, and between strains, the M transcript was relatively more abundant in M41. In Beaudette, two novel TRS were identified, one in the viral 3\u2032 UTR immediately downstream of the N gene termination codon, and one mapping to a TRS-B within the S gene. In the former, a short ORF (dORF) -initiated two nt 3\u2032 of the TRS -is present and ribosomally occupied. The potential biological relevance of this ORF remains to be determined; Coronaviral N proteins are highly basic, reflecting the fact that they associate tightly with the negatively charged gRNA (Laude et al., 1995) , and a previous meta-analysis has indicated that the decoding of positively charged amino acid residues is associated with a lowering in the speed of translation (Charneski and Hurst 2013; Sabi & Tuller, 2015; Requiao et al., 2016) . Thus, it is possible that the relatively low TE of N is an unavoidable consequence of its amino acid composition. N expression may also be regulated by a putative uORF whose initiation codon is located some 50 nt upstream of the N AUG codon (Fig. 6) .",

It was evident that both 4b and 4c are efficiently translated, at levels comparable to those of the 5a/5b accessory protein-encoding genes. The mechanism by which ribosomes might access ORF4c, however, is not clear. Given the absence of AUG codons within the regions between the 5\u2032 ends of ORF4b and ORF4c in both Beaudette and M41 (Supp. Fig. S9) , and the weak initiation context of the ORF4b start codon, it is possible that a proportion of ribosomes might bypass the ORF4b initiation codon and instead translate ORF4c via \"leaky scanning\" (Firth and Brierley, 2012) , although it should be noted that intervening AUG codons do exist in some other IBV strains (Supp. Fig. S9) .",

Two of these pause sites appear to correspond to uORFs initiated at non-AUG initiation codons, one in the 5\u2032 UTR and one upstream of the N gene. the other pause sites correspond to ribosomes paused post-initiation early in the coding regions of the S and M genes. A biological explanation for this is lacking at present. We are aware that the treatment of yeast cells with cycloheximide can lead to an early block in elongation in stressed cells (Gerashchenko and Gladyshev, 2014; Duncan and Mata, 2017) , but meta-analysis of host genes in our infected cells does not reveal an obvious elongation block. Further, the S and M genes show deep ribosome coverage along their lengths, inconsistent with a block in elongation. The remaining pause site (in fact a doublet) appears during translation of the nsP4 region of the polyprotein close to the C-terminus of nsP4. Coronaviral nsP4 proteins are important for the membrane rearrangements required for viral RNA synthesis and contain multiple membrane spanning domains (Doyle et al., 2018) . A possible explanation for the ribosomal pauses seen here is that translation is paused to permit the correct folding of nsP4 into membranes.",

As mentioned above, their origin is uncertain, but it seems unrelated to the identity of the P-site tRNA. Recent studies have shown that P-site prolyl-tRNA is a strong determinant of ribosomal pausing, partly due to the slow rate of peptide bond formation with this amino acid (Sabi and Tuller, 2015; . However, none of the stall sites identified here have proline tRNA in the P-site. One possible explanation we cannot rule out is that some feature of the nascent peptide engenders pausing through interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel or chaperones; clusters of positively-charged amino acid residues have been documented to induce ribosome pausing (Ingolia, 2014; Sabi and Tuller, 2017) , although such clusters are not evident upstream of the pause sites seen here. The recent developments of methodologies and algorithms to identify and characterise ribosomal pause sites may clarify the situation in future (Chadani et al., 2016; Kumari et al., 2018) . Our data indicate that the host response to IBV is mediated primarily at the level of transcription, with the up-regulation of hundreds of genes, many of which have immune-related functions.",

A maximum of two mismatches were allowed when mapping. Read counts per gene (protein-coding genes only) were obtained using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015) , with a requirement that reads map entirely within the forward strand coding sequence (htseq-count parameters: -m intersection-strict -s yes -t CDS). For each comparison of experimental groups, only genes with an average of at least 50 mapped reads were included in differential expression analyses. GO term enrichment analysis was carried out using the topGO package in R (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2018) and Fisher's exact test was used to assess the enrichment of individual GO terms in specific gene lists. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (Szklarczyk et al., 2017) . Table S1 . Library composition statistics: table of read counts per library. Random 7nt sequences were added to the ends of both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 adaptors during library preparation to facilitate the removal of duplicate reads introduced during PCR. All libraries were de-duplicated following the removal of the adaptor sequences, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Numbers of reads mapped to the forward (fwd) and reverse (rev) strands of the viral gRNA are shown separately in each case; only forward strand-mapping reads are included in the host mRNA counts. Table S4 . Top 20 most significantly enriched GO terms among genes which are up-regulated in IBV M41-infected cells relative to IBV Beaudette-infected cells. Column \"Annotated\" shows the total number of genes in the data set which are members of that GO term; \"Significant\" shows the number that are significantly differentially expressed; and \"Expected\" shows the proportion of genes that would be expected to occur in a random sample.

When performing analyses of viral and host gene expression, only 28-and 29-nt RiboSeq reads (corresponding to RPFs mapping primarily in phase 0) and only \u2265 40 nt RNASeq reads were used.A 12-nt offset was applied to the 5\u2032 mapping positions of RPFs, to approximate the P-site position of the ribosome (see Supp.Fig. S4andIrigoyen et al., 2016). To normalize for different library sizes, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of total virus RNA plus total host RefSeq mRNA (positive sense reads only) as the denominator.Host mRNA RiboSeq and RNASeq phasing distributions were derived from reads mapping internally to the coding regions of ORFs; specifically, the 5\u2032 end of the read had to map between the first nucleotide of the initiation codon and 30 nt 5\u2032 of the last nucleotide of the termination codon, thus, in general, excluding RPFs of initiating or terminating ribosomes. Histograms of 5\u2032 host mRNA reads relative to initiation and termination codons (Supp.",
