A fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIV hemagglutinin was produced and labeled with fluorescein to use it as a labeled antigen in FPIA. This labeled antigen was mixed with anti-AIV sera (H1-H16 subtypes) and FP of the mixture was measured using a portable FP analyzer on a microdevice. It was found that FP increased in proportion to the concentration of anti-H5 AIV antibody (serum) and was significantly higher than FP obtained with the other sera. The selective detection of anti-H5 subtype AIV antibody was confirmed. The required volume of original sample was 2 \u03bcL and analysis time was within 20 min. This detection system realizes an efficient on-site diagnosis and surveillance of AIV.",

[10] [11] When a diagnosis is performed at the site of a disease outbreak, a rapid, simple and accurate antigen detection method is required. On the other hand, in the process from a disease occurrence to its cleanup and under a usual surveillance system, antibody detection to check for previous infections also plays an important role. Even in poultry that do not currently have the virus, the history of past infection can be determined by detecting antibodies. This is essential for investigating the routes of transmission of infectious diseases. As a recent example, antibody tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have received broad attention to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). [12] [13] Although some antibody tests, such as the agar gel immunodiffusion test, hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are used for the detection of anti-AIV antibody, 14-18 these methods require complicated operations and a long reaction time. Therefore, it is impractical to use these methods outside the laboratory. If the method is developed that can rapidly and easily provide antibody test results outside the laboratory, field applications become possible and the surveillance system using the antibody test can be significantly strengthened.",

[19] [20] Advantages of FPIA compared to other immunoassays are the simplicity and rapidity of its procedures and the short measurement time. FPIA does not need a washing step and the reaction is completed by simply mixing the reagents together. In this study, we developed a system that selectively detected anti-H5 AIV serum by measuring P value of the mixture of an anti-AIV serum and fluorescein-labeled H5 subtype hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein using a newly designed microdevice based on our previously developed microdevice with a portable FP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 analyzer 21-23 ( Fig. 1(a) ) . Besides being portable, our FP analyzer is low cost and has high throughput, and these features make it possible to conduct FPIA outside the laboratory. All procedures from sampling to obtaining measurement results can be completed on-site, and that contributes to a significant increase in efficiency of diagnosis and surveillance. Kingdom).",

The negative photoresist SU-8 3050 was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer. The PDMS prepolymer with black silicon rubber was poured onto the mold and cured. The cured PDMS was pasted on a glass slide. Figs. 1 (b) and (c) show a photograph and a schematic drawing of the microfluidic device. We designed the microfluidic device for this experiment based on the basic device. The microdevice had nine channels arranged in the field of view of the portable FP analyzer, and nine samples could be measured at one time. The width of the channel was 200 \u03bcm and the depth is 900 \u03bcm. The depth of the microfluidic device was significantly different from our previous device. By employing a channel having a high aspect ratio, it was possible to increase the fluorescence intensity per unit area and reduce specific surface area. These features contributed to highly sensitive measurement (Fig. S1 ). The numbers in Fig. 1 (c) denote inlets and outlets, and the solution was injected into the inlet with a pipet (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).",

A free fluorescence-labeled antigen emits random fluorescence when excited by polarized light and it gives a low P value. When a fluorescence-labeled antigen is bound to an antibody, P value is high due to the much slower Brownian motion of the antibody-H5-rHA complex. [19] [20] Fig. 2 shows the schematic illustration of FPIA in this work. When anti-H5 antibody in serum binds to a fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA, P value becomes high. Therefore, anti-H5 AIV serum containing a large amount of anti-H5 HA antibodies shows a higher P value than that of the antibody-negative serum. In this work, we used the fragment of H5-rHA (not whole H5-rHA) as an antigen to improve the sensitivity. Using a smaller fluorescence-labeled antigen reduces P value of the blank sample. Fig. 3 shows an example of a P image obtained using our portable FP analyzer. Samples used were a mixture Our microdevice required 20 \u03bcL of solution per one channel.

As the incubation time increased, P value increased and became an almost constant value at 5 min. Therefore, the change of P value due to the changing rotational motion of the fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIV hemagglutinin labeled by fluorescein could be detected by our analyzer. In the next experiments, the incubation period was set at 15 min at which time the reaction of the fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and a serum was sufficiently progressed. Then,Fig. 5shows the measured P value results after mixing fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and anti-H5 AIV serum diluted with PBS. P value increased as the serum dilution rate decreased (increased concentration). The more antibodies the serum had, the greater the number of antigen-antibody complexes that were formed in the excess amount of fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA. Increasing P value with increasing concentration of serum meant that antigen-antibody complexes successfully formed.

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from H5N3 subtype AIV (A/whistling swan/Shimane/499/1983).26 The viral RNA was extracted from the virus with Isogen-LS, and then reverse transcribed into cDNA by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase. For amplification of the partial HA gene (aa 284-425), PCR was performed using the TaKaRa Ex Taq and the following primers: 5'-GGCCATGGAACTGGAGTATGGTAACTGT-3' and 5'-GGCCATGGCCATTTTCTTATTTAAATT-3', which include restriction enzyme site sequences (underlined). The PCR cycle included an initial cycle at 94 \u2103 for 1 min, then 30 cycles at 94 \u2103 for 20 s, 58 \u2103 for 30 s, and 72\u2103 for 2 min, and a final extension at 72\u2103 for 7 min.
