Dry cough and fever are the most common symptoms of COVID-19 infection, which can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and end-organ failure[1]. Risk factors for ARDS and death are older age, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, elevated inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein, serum ferritin), and organ (AST, albumin, creatinine, urea, LDH) and coagulation dysfunction (PT and D-dimer). In addition, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease can have an adverse prognosis[2]. Diagnosis of COVID-19 encompasses a mixture of clinical suspicion and imaging techniques, including point-of care lung ultrasound (US) and a chest CT scan[3].",

At the time of writing, there have been no previous reports of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 pneumonia.

She denied chest pain and dyspnoea (PaO2/FiO2 >300 mmHg on nasal prong oxygen). Physical examination revealed oedema of the right leg and signs of dehydration. Compression ultrasound (CUS) of the right common femoral vein indicated venous thrombosis (Fig. 1). Lung US showed multiple bibasal consolidations (Fig. 2). Echocardiography documented normal ventricular function in the absence of indirect signs of PE. The inferior vena cava had completely collapsed, indicating hypovolemia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia. Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer (24 131 mg/dl), fibrinogen (674 mg/dl), serum ferritin (765 ng/ml) and troponin I (57 ng/ml) (Table 1). As creatinine clearance was \u226430 ml/min, continuous intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin was started with close monitoring of partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient underwent a CT scan of the chest that showed diffuse bilateral consolidations and a crazy-paving pattern (visual CT score 70%) (Fig. 3). Based on this finding, we introduced systemic corticosteroids. The patient is still recovering at the time of writing. Her clinical condition is progressively improving with complete resolution of acute renal failure after infusion of crystalloid fluids (Table 1). She needs only low-flow oxygen therapy. The heparin infusion was switched after 3 days to standard-dose LMWH (enoxaparin).",

COVID-19 patients frequently complain of severe asthenia, fatigue and consequent inactivity, even at the beginning of the infection. In addition, risk factors for VTE include hypoxia and sepsis[9], which are two common features of COVID-19. Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia[8], but no data have been reported in the literature for the different stages of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, D-dimer is not a useful marker for diagnosing VTE in COVID-19, because it is generally increased, particularly in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and is associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death[1]. Based on all this evidence, if there are clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, CUS and echocardiography should always be performed, irrespective of disease stage. Our findings suggest that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia should be investigated for VTE even if treated with LMWH. [Q5]Both our patients seemed to be at risk of VTE even in the absence of hypoxaemia and severe respiratory failure, and it is clear VTE can increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients.",
