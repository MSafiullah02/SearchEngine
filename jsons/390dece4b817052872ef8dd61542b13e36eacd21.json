Hypotheses Generation) is a systematic knowledge discovery process that elicit novel inferences about previously unknown scientific knowledge by rationally connecting complementary and non-interactive literature. Prompt identification of such novel knowledge is beneficial not only for researchers but also for various other stakeholders such as universities, funding bodies and academic publishers. Almost all the prior LBD research suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the over-reliance of domaindependent resources which restrict the models' applicability to certain domains/problems. In this regard, we propose a generalisable LBD model that supports both cross-domain and cross-lingual knowledge discovery. The second persistent research deficiency is the mere focus of static snapshot of the corpus (i.e. ignoring the temporal evolution of topics) to detect the new knowledge. However, the knowledge in scientific literature changes dynamically and thus relying merely on static snapshot limits the model's ability in capturing semantically meaningful connections. As a result, we propose a novel temporal model that captures semantic change of topics using diachronic word embeddings to unravel more accurate connections. The model was evaluated using the largest available literature repository to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed cues towards recommending novel knowledge.",

            "text": "To this end, Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) (a.k.a. Hypotheses Generation) which is a sub-discipline of text mining aims to infer such interesting cross-silo associations that bridge uncorrelated fragments of information to provide novel, actionable and meaningful insights in the field. For instance, consider two disjoint topics of interest (A and C ); a therapeutic substance (e.g., fish oil ) and a disease (e.g., raynaud ) where the LBD process attempts to elicit novel conceptual bridges [3] (e.g., blood viscosity) that meaningfully connect the two knowledge fragments (Fig. 1) . Hence, the ultimate motive of LBD research is to give new impetus to deduce new knowledge that will conclusively accelerate scientific productivity and research innovation. Discovering such conceptual bridges in a cross-disciplinary manner is the crux of the problem that we intend to address. Despite the significant advances gained so far in the discipline, almost all the LBD systems suffer from two major drawbacks; 1) Domain dependency: the existing LBD studies are mainly restricted to the medical domain and rely on medical-related knowledge resources (e.g., MeSH, UMLS ) throughout their workflow. Some of the LBD studies are not generalisable within the medical domain itself due to the usage of highly specialised resources [8] . As a result, extending these techniques in other non-medical LBD settings (e.g., computer science domain) is infeasible. Consequently, LBD research outside of the medical domain is in a nascent stage [8] , and 2) Static domains: the prior LBD studies are based on the assumption that the domains remain static. This clearly hinders the model's performance in recommending time-aware novel knowledge linkages as the domains are changing dynamically, and new knowledge is being added to each domain every single day. Otherwise stated, the contribution of temporal cues in eliciting novel knowledge has been overlooked in the discipline [3] .",

            "text": "More recently, a few studies [3, 4, 12] have attempted to mitigate the second limitation, which is considering the domains to be static through the infusion of temporal dimension into the LBD process. Even though these studies undoubtedly invigorate the traditional LBD setting, they still contain several inherent limitations. Firstly, the temporal analysis component of these studies is fairly shallow. For example, Xun et al. [12] have only considered the first and last values of the temporal sequence to measure the trend of implicit associations by ignoring the patterns in the overall sequence. Secondly, as of most of the existing LBD literature, these studies rely on one or two temporal characteristics to discover potential new knowledge linkages. This is limiting as such methodologies may excessively be picking only one type of novel knowledge. We believe that the novel knowledge is in different forms in the literature and thus, should fulfil multiple factors to broadly discover them. We observed a similar conclusion from the ARROWSMITH study [11] initiated by the pioneers in LBD discipline and from a recent LBD review [9] . To alleviate the aforementioned limitations, this study attempts to answer the following questions; does analysing whole time-series in a greater detail benefits in eliciting new knowledge?, and does providing a holistic solution that combines the complementary strengths of multiple characteristics (e.g., multiple semantic shifts) yield better predictive effects?",

The major limitation of these methods is their excessive dependency on highly frequent topics.

Secondly, the availability of such specialised resources is highly limited to certain problems [8] . Subsequently, another line of research [6] has integrated graph theory to the LBD process by analysing graph properties at; macro-level (e.g., shortest path), meso-level (e.g., clustering coefficient), and micro-level (e.g., centrality measures).

Hence, the most objective and commonly used quantitative evaluation technique in LBD discipline is to check if the predicted novel discoveries have actually taken place in the future (a.k.a. time sliced evaluation) [9] . For this purpose, the literature is divided into two segments using a cut-off-date namely; 1) pre-cut-off segment: where the literature in this segment are used as the input to the LBD models to discover the novel knowledge and 2) post cut-off segment: where the literature in this segment are used to verify if the predicted discoveries of the LBD models have actually been discovered and published. In other words, a generated discovery is considered to be valid only if it is absent in pre cut-off segment (i.e. the predicted discovery has not taken place until the cut-off-date) and present in the post cut-off segment (i.e. the predicted discovery has been discovered and published after the cut-off-date) (see footnote 4).",

For instance, Davies [9] has identified five forms of novel knowledge in FO-RD and MG-MIG test cases. Thus, our model take the advantage of detecting novel knowledge in different forms by capturing the semantic change at multiple levels; individual shifts, pairwise shifts and neighbourhood shifts, 2) Global analysis: Unlike most of the prior LBD research that merely focus on cues at local scale, we analysed the concepts' trajectories in a global context. This facilitates the analysis of concepts neighbourhood in a wider scope. For example, consider \"blood viscosity\" conceptual bridge of FO-RD test case. This conceptual bridge may also be associated with other chemical substances of FO (such as eicosapentaenoic acid ). However, query specific local corpus often limits in accommodating such implicit interactions, 3) Detailed temporal analysis: While almost all the prior LBD research are based on the static literature, we considered the temporal behaviour of concepts to discover new knowledge. This allows the model to detect time-aware knowledge recommendations that have higher semantic meaning. Moreover, it is also evident that analysing the time-series in detail benefits in LBD workflow (in contrast to baselines such as DE [12] ), and 4) Generalisability: The proposed temporal clues are free from knowledge inferences from domain-dependent resources (unlike baselines such as AR [11] ). This meets our objective of generalisabe cues whose predictive effects do not rely on the specialised knowledgebases. Moreover, our initial preprocessing phase is also adaptable to multiple domains and languages due to strengths of DBpedia. Thus, our solution can be easily integrated to non-medical LBD settings.",

AR is arguably the most popular and well-maintained LBD system in the discipline that currently has nearly 1200 of monthly user-base [6] . We observe two main reasons for its performance gain compared to the remaining baselines. Firstly, it considers seven characteristics to determine the potentiality of the novel knowledge (i.e. the use of multiple characteristics). Secondly, three of their characteristics include global literature analysis which benefits in identifying the concept's global properties that are not visible to local corpus. However, three of its features require the analysis of UMLS and MeSH, which restricts the suitability of AR baseline only to the medical domain.",
