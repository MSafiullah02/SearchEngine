[10] reported that influenza-infected patients had normal serum cortisol levels but low ACTH levels. These results are difficult to reconcile unless the patients' serum contained abnormal binding agents to ACTH. For example, if these patients had autoantibodies to ACTH, the antibodies would have interfered with the ACTH immunoassay, especially if the autoantibodies and assay antibodies were competing for the same antigenic region of the ACTH molecule, which is likely. This would result in an erroneously low ACTH reading. The assay would only measure unbound ACTH, as demonstrated in the report by Pranzatelli et al. [11] of a 9-year old boy with opsoclonus\u2013myoclonus who was determined to have ACTH levels of 72 and 4.3 pg/ml using conventional ACTH immunoassay analyses. After solid-phase extraction of the ACTH, the total ACTH level measured by radioimmunoassay was 3000 pg/ml. ACTH antibodies were subsequently detected in the boy's serum. Similarly, Jefferies et al.'s ACTH data only approximates the free ACTH levels. The measurement of subnormal ACTH levels of influenza-infected patients is consistent with the existence of an abnormal binding agent.",

If influenza virus stimulates the production of ACTH autoantibodies, after infection, as the autoantibodies interfere with adrenocortical secretion, the infected individual will enter a state of relative adrenocortical insufficiency, where their corticosteroid needs are greater than their available supply. Furthermore, unlike the increased corticosteroid levels that would be expected during a systemic immune response, influenza-infected patients do not have increased cortisol levels [10]. For example, rats injected with sheep red blood cells demonstrated two to threefold increases in corticosteroid levels [13]. It is reported that during the initial phase, before the onset of respiratory disease, SARS symptoms in adults mimic those of influenza [14]. Therefore, a viral-induced state of relative adrenocortical insufficiency can explain many of the initial symptoms of SARS and influenza.",

A reasonable recommended prophylactic corticosteroid dose for adults likely to be exposed to SARS and exposed adults in quarantine is a low supraphysiological dose: 20 mg oral prednisone twice a day. Of course, when discontinuing the corticosteroid treatment, this should be done by tapering the dosage.",
