Some variants of CoVs are associated with outbreaks, some others are continuously circulating and cause mostly mild respiratory infections (eg, the common cold). The most well known of these CoVs is the SARS\u2010CoV, which between 2002 and 2003 was responsible to cause an outbreak that spread around the world and resulted in over 8000 cases and 774 deaths, with a case fatality rate of around 9% to 11%.\n3\n In 2012, a novel CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, causing severe respiratory symptoms was identified.\n4\n Very recently, in December 2019, a novel beta\u2010CoV, was responsible of a new illness, first detected in Wuhan, China.\n5\n We now know this to be another outbreak of CoV in humans (the 7th), that was recently renamed as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The origin of the virus is still unclear, however, genomic analysis suggests nCoV is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats.\n6\n\n",

While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, which is now under quarantine, the virus has spread throughout China and abroad, including Western and South\u2010Eastern Pacific regions, European regions, Eastern Mediterranean regions as well as many states in the United States of America.\n8\n It comes amid signs of the virus's shift away from its origins in China, with Italy, Iran, and South Korea emerging as the other countries hit hardest by the deadly disease. Italy is the worst affected country in Europe, with more than 4636 cases, a rise of 778 in a day, and a death toll of 197, an increase of 49.\n9\n Nevertheless, there is still limited information about the genomic epidemiology of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 circulating in Italy from genomic surveillance studies that impairs our understanding of the virus introduction, establishment, and dissemination in the country. Thus, to better understand the emergence of the recent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic in Italy, we analyzed a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the COVID\u20102019 epidemic to improve more effective intervention strategies.",

An ML phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) was built to explore the recent Italian genomes relationship with previous worldwide isolates. ML phylogenies suggested that the three Italian strains, grouped into two different well\u2010supported phylogenetic clades (bootstrap score [BS] 0.80, 0.99, respectively). We found that two isolates from Italy (EPI_ISL_410546 a Chinese tourist from Hubei Province, and EPI_ISL_412974 the first Italian case isolate in Rome Italy) fall within a clade (BS = 94%) (Figure 1A clade 1) including sequences from several countries as China, Japan, Singapore, England, Australia, and Canada. However, it is important to note that sequences from China are positioned basally to this first clade, reinforcing the idea that the first introduction event could be mediated, as suspected by China.",

Phylogenetic analyses further suggest that the CoV epidemic might have been reintroduce to the country via Germany, since the basal sequence of this clade is a case that emerged in Munich in Germany in January 2020, highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission and a tight connection within European countries.",

Our results indicate that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 circulation in Italy likely started from different multiple introductions from China and Germany (Figure 1, clades 1 and 2) (suggesting a possible European linkage) followed by autochthonous transmission within Italy. Moreover, more genomic data will be fundamental to shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in the country helping to understand how the virus is spreading both around the world and thought time. More genomic surveillance efforts during epidemics should be undertaken to provide enough data to make reliable inferences on the molecular epidemiology of the rapidly evolving virus. Phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains. Consequently, this analysis has to be considered as the first preliminary report regarding the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic in Italy that highlights two independent introductions probably mediated by China and Germany, respectively. This could reinforce the tight connection within samples that have been isolated all over Europe, indicating that the virus is spreading quite widely in Europe suggesting that it could be likely spreading in the general population.",
