Although LOHC tends to be self-limiting after 1 or 2 weeks, some patients, particularly the patients who received alternative donor allo-HSCT, can show refractory LOHC which can persist for several months [6]. Refractory LOHC may lead to poor quality of life, even mortality, after allo-HSCT. Given the assumption that alloimmune injury might also be involved in the pathogenesis of LOHC [7], Huang et al. [8] used corticosteroids to treat patients with refractory LOHC, and all of them achieved complete remission (CR). However, the small sample size of the patients (n = 11) in this pilot study limited the ability to further identify the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of LOHC. Thus, in the present retrospective study, we aimed to further evaluate the treatments, particularly the use of corticosteroids, in patients with LOHC after allo-HSCT.",

Minimal residual disease (MRD)-directed immunotherapy (e.g., donor lymphocyte infusion and interferon-\u03b1) was given before hematological relapse, as a preemptive intervention therapy, 2 months post-HSCT [14, 15].

Thus, we hypothesized that anti-infection therapies should be the basis for the treatment of LOHC after allo-HSCT. In the present study, more than 80% of the patients with grade 1 to 2 LOHC achieved CR after anti-infection therapies.",

            "text": "Although infection may be the most important cause of LOHC in allo-HSCT recipients [30], some patients showed unsatisfactory response to anti-infection treatments, particularly for those with severe LOHC. In the present study, only 12.5% of patients with grade 3 to 4 LOHC could achieve CR after anti-infection therapies alone. Thus, other pathogeneses, such as immune injury, may also contribute to the occurrence of LOHC after allo-HSCT. Ost et al. [31] suggested that post-engraftment LOHC represent uroepithelial GVHD. Several studies also reported the association between acute GVHD and LOHC after allo-HSCT [19, 28]. In the present study, we observed that more than 60% of the patients showed acute GVHD. Thus, the association of LOHC with GVHD regarding timing, incidence, and severity suggests that its pathogenesis may involve a local inflammatory environment, cellular immune responses, effector mechanisms, and HLA as well as non-HLA genetics [5]. In addition, several infectious agents can trigger autoimmunity via different mechanisms [32], and several studies have observed that infections, particularly viral infections, can trigger a graft-versus-host reaction [33\u201335]. In the model of Leung et al. [7] for LOHC, infected uroepithelial cells are attacked by donor lymphoid cells, leading to tissue destruction. Thus, the role of additional corticosteroid therapy after anti-infection and supportive therapies is worth considering in the treatment of patients with LOHC, particularly those showing unsatisfactory responses to anti-infection therapies. Huang et al. [8] reported that 11 patients with refractory LOHC received a low dose of corticosteroids, and all of them achieved CR. In the present study, although 88.0% of the patients who showed an unsatisfactory response to supportive and anti-infection therapies and received additional corticosteroid therapies had severe LOHC, more than half of them showed an immediate response to corticosteroid and 77.1% finally achieved CR. Thus, the additional corticosteroid therapies may be able to significantly shorten and change the course of LOHC and it may be a potential therapy for LOHC patients showing unsatisfactory response to anti-infection therapies.",
