As such, NIV should be considered first-line therapy for this patient group, and can be safely used in appropriately staffed and monitored environments outside of the ICU.4 This does not preclude the use of NIV in patients with more severe respiratory failure,8, 9, 10 and a pH as low as 7.20 may still be compatible with favourable outcomes. However, such patients should be managed in a high-dependency environment, to allow for rapid escalation to intubation and invasive ventilation if appropriate.",

Appropriateness of ventilatory support may also be an issue requiring advanced discussion with patients and families. Once a decision to intubate has been made, the transition from an awake and self-ventilating patient to controlled invasive ventilation can be very difficult in the critically ill. Most patients will have evidence of developing or established organ dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction (ischaemic heart disease, sepsis), and commonly such patients are hypovolaemic. Both anaesthetic induction agents and positive pressure ventilation (which decreases venous return) produce cardiovascular depression and peri-intubation hypotension is common. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation can lead to very rapid desaturation in such patients, due to their marginal respiratory reserve and circulatory problems. Such consequences need to be anticipated: large-volume cannulae should be in place; access to plasma expanders and inotropes should be immediately available; and following induction of anaesthesia the airway must be rapidly secured by an experienced member of the critical care team \u2013 ideally in an appropriately equipped area of the hospital.",

Although it is not without controversy,34 this and subsequent studies form the basis for management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure.
