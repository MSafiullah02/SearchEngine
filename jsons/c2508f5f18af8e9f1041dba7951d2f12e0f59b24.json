' * '~-~~ The relatively milder illnesses associated with rhinoviruses and coronaviruses likely reflect the biological characteristics of these viruses. Rhinovirus replicates poorly at core body temperature of 37\u00b0C and appears to produce symptoms via chemical mediators rather than direct viral invasion.26 Although less well studied because of fastidious growth requirements, coronaviruses also do not appear to cause significant damage to respiratory epithelium. The lower respiratory signs of wheezing and rales without evidence of pneumonia in our patients suggest that these viruses cause disease in older persons by aggravating preexisting congestive heart failure or inducing bronchospasm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The incidence of rhinovirus and coronavirus 229E infections in the daycare centers was found to be nearly identical. Since we tested only for one of the two most common serotypes of coronavirus infection and the incidence of 229E and OC43 are roughly equivalent, it is possible that the number of illnesses attributable to coronavirus may actually have been double what was reported. The small intermittent clusters of infections in staff and participants at each center suggest that these viruses were introduced into the centers from outside sources. However, once introduced, some element of nosocomial spread is also likely because of close contact between staff and older persons. The daycare policy that encourages participants to attend daycare so they can receive medical attention from the on-site physicians may have influenced the overall incidence of infection in the daycare. However, this concern must be balanced with the need to provide medical care to this very debilitated group of older persons. The daycare center requires that employees with febrile illnesses and/or uncontrolled respiratory symptoms stay out of work until symptoms resolve. However, many of the common respiratory viruses do not cause fever or severe symptoms in young healthy persons, and, therefore, most healthcare workers suffering from upper respiratory illnesses do not miss work. Because many individuals, both staff and participants, will be experiencing 'colds' and be in close contact throughout the winter months, good infection control practices in daycare centers are critical.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Most respiratory viruses, with the exception of influenza viruses, require relatively close contact for transmission.''
