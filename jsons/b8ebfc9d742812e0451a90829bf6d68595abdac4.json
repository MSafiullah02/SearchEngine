Research suggests that probiotics are able to decrease the risk or duration of respiratory infection symptoms. However, the antiviral mechanisms of probiotics are unclear. The purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge on the effects of probiotics on respiratory virus infections and to provide insights on the possible antiviral mechanisms of probiotics. A PubMed and Scopus database search was performed up to January 2014 using appropriate search terms on probiotic and respiratory virus infections in cell models, in animal models, and in humans, and reviewed for their relevance. Altogether, thirty-three clinical trials were reviewed. The studies varied highly in study design, outcome measures, probiotics, dose, and matrices used. Twenty-eight trials reported that probiotics had beneficial effects in the outcome of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and five showed no clear benefit. Only eight studies reported investigating viral etiology from the respiratory tract, and one of these reported a significant decrease in viral load. Based on experimental studies, probiotics may exert antiviral effects directly in probiotic-virus interaction or via stimulation of the immune system. Although probiotics seem to be beneficial in respiratory illnesses, the role of probiotics on specific viruses has not been investigated sufficiently. Due to the lack of confirmatory studies and varied data available, more randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials in different age populations investigating probiotic dose response, comparing probiotic strains/genera, and elucidating the antiviral effect mechanisms are necessary.",

Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the largest group of respiratory viruses, comprising over 150 serotypes [2] . In humans, the predominant illness caused by HRV is the acute upper RTI, also known as the common cold. The second most common viruses infecting humans are the human enteroviruses (HEV), which are associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to serious conditions [2] . Influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenoviruses are also major causative agents of both upper and lower RTIs [3] [4] [5] . In addition, many other viruses or virus groups cause RTIs, e.g., parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses can cause a broad spectrum of respiratory diseases, ranging from mild upper RTIs to pneumonia [6] . In recent years, with the rapid development of high-throughput molecular techniques, several new viruses associated with respiratory diseases, such as human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, and the new coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63, have been identified as well [7] .",

Large varieties of etiologic agents and increasing antibiotic and antiviral resistance challenge the development of efficient therapies.

However, in a subgroup with L. rhamnosus GG identification in feces, L. rhamnosus GG usage reduced the duration of RTIs. In hospitalized children, L. rhamnosus GG reduced the risk of RTIs and duration of RTI episodes [42] . In preterm infants, L. rhamnosus GG reduced the incidence of RTIs [46] . In addition, a meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials investigating the role of L. rhamnosus GG in the prevention of respiratory infections in children showed that L. rhamnosus GG has the potential to reduce the risk of upper RTIs, incidence of acute otitis media, and antibiotic use.

The use of B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 in healthy newborns was able to reduce the number of RTIs as well, but was ineffective in reducing the occurrence of acute otitis media (AOM) or symptoms of otitis media [52] . In healthy infants, treatment with L. reuteri SD112, but not with B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, resulted in fewer days of absence from day care due to illness, lower number of days with fever, and clinical visits. Both strains were ineffective in reducing the incidence or duration of RTIs [53, 54] . In healthy children, L. casei CRL431 or L. reuteri DSM17938 did not reduce the incidence, number, or duration of acute RTIs or RTI episodes [55] .",

A variety of probiotic strains have been used in these clinical trials, most of them belonging to the genus Lactobacillus. In addition, various combinations of probiotics have been used. Of 33 studies, altogether, 28 studies reported that probiotics had beneficial effects in the outcome of RTIs and five showed no clear benefit. Only eight studies, however, reported investigating the viral etiology. Of these, only one study showed a statistically significant reduction in the virus load in the probiotic group. A Cochrane systematic review by Hao et al. concluded that probiotics were better than placebo in terms of reducing the number of upper RTI episodes, the incidence of acute upper RTI episodes, and antibiotics used [15] . Although clinical trials show that the use of specific probiotics and probiotic combinations are beneficial in RTIs, there are also studies that report no clear advantage. In addition, several viruses can cause respiratory illnesses, but only a few studies have investigated probiotics' effectiveness on viral agents. The lack of consistent evidence between probiotic strains/genera and even within strains may be due to variation in study designs and reported outcome measures, the length of intervention, study populations used (children vs. adults) or bacterial doses (10 6 -10 10 cfu), and matrices (milk, yoghurt, capsule) used. In addition, in the elderly, decreased immunity due to aging may partly explain the conflicting results [79] .",

Virus attachment to a host cell is the first essential step in the disease process, and, therefore, interruption of this attachment could be beneficial to the host. Probiotic bacteria may bind directly to the virus and inhibit virus attachment to the host cell receptor. For instance, there is evidence that specific strains of lactobacilli are able to bind and inactivate vesicular stomatitis virus (flu-like virus) in vitro [81] . Probiotics may also show direct antimicrobial activity against pathogens by producing antimicrobial substances such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, and bacteriocins [12] . In experimental studies in epithelial cells and macrophages, metabolic products of specific lactobacilli and bifidobacteria prevented vesicular stomatitis virus infection in a strain-specific manner [81] . In addition, metabolites of bacteria in yoghurts showed antiviral activity, inhibiting influenza virus replication [82] . The induction of low-level synthesis of nitric oxide may also be involved in the protective actions of probiotics against viruses in the respiratory cells, as shown in alveolar macrophages in vitro [27, 83, 84] . However, it should be noted that respiratory viruses infect cells with different mechanisms by using various receptors and, also, the antiviral effects of probiotics are strain-specific.",

Probiotics may mediate their antiviral effects against respiratory viruses possibly by eliciting systemic immune responses via gut or enhancing cellular immunity in the airways with increased activity of natural killer cells and macrophages. In the gut epithelial cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, probiotics are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) [85] [86] [87] [88] .

The variability in the outcomes between clinical trials studying probiotics' role in RTIs may be explained by the use of different probiotic strains, bacterial dose, and matrices. In addition, it should be noted that the effects of probiotics are highly strain-specific and the adequate amount of bacteria transferred into the effector sites in the gut may be crucial. Due to the lack of confirmatory studies and varied data available, more randomized, double-blind, and placebocontrolled clinical trials in different age populations investigating probiotic dose response, comparing probiotic strains, and elucidating the mechanisms of effects are necessary.",

The inclusion of serological and immunological diagnostics, such as the identification of virus-specific immunoglobulins and cytokines, in clinical research would have clear benefits in providing valuable information on the effects of probiotics in respiratory virus infections.

Probiotic therapy may offer an interesting alternative in the alleviation or prevention of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which cause a significant health and economic burden to humans. Based on this review, clinical trials in human subjects show promising data demonstrating that specific probiotics are able to shorten the duration or reduce the risk of respiratory infections. However, only a few clinical studies have actually investigated the effects of probiotics on specific viruses, which are the most common agents causing RTIs. Thus, more clinical research should be targeted to revealing which probiotics or their combinations would be the most effective ones against RTI viruses.",
