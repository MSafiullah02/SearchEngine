On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus infection as COVID-19. On February 22, 2020, the National Health Commission announced that the English name of the novel coronavirus pneumonia was COVID-19 [1]. Because COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the population is generally susceptible, early diagnosis and early isolation and treatment are of great significance for disease prognosis and epidemic control. At present, COVID-19 virus nucleic acid positivity or viral gene sequencing positivity is an important basis for diagnosis. However, chest CT, as the most commonly used imaging examination for respiratory diseases, has an irreplaceable role in the detection and evaluation of COVID-19 [2]. This study dynamically observed the imaging characteristics of patients who were infected with COVID-19 from the onset of clinical symptoms until recovery. We also assessed some laboratory indexes of patients to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and management of COVID-19.",

In the early stage (1\u20133 days), 21 (100%) patients presented with patchy wedge-shaped, fan-shaped, round, or irregular ground-glass lesions, some of which had the long axis parallel to the adjacent pleura (Figure 2). Three patients (14.3%) presented with sub-solidified ground-glass-like shadows with uneven density, and 11 (52.4%) showed reticular interlobular septal thickening. At 4\u20136 days, 9 patients (40.9%) had disease progression, which was characterized by increased ground-glass shadows, enlargement, increased density, patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, partial fusion, and reticular interlobular septal thickening, and the remaining 13 were patients who received the first CT examination.

In a relatively closed environment, COVID-19 can be transmitted through aerosol for a long time, and patients in the incubation period and asymptomatic virus carriers are also infectious [2,3]. The incubation period is generally 1\u201314 days, and most show symptoms 3\u20137 days after infection. There are very few cases in which the incubation period exceeds 14 days, and the longest can reach 24 days [4]. Fever, cough, and fatigue are the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in the early stage. A few patients present with other symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea. The clinical manifestations of the 44 patients in this group, in which 38 had fever (86.4%) and 35 had cough (79.5%), are in line with other studies. At present, the diagnostic criteria are mainly based on real-time fluorescent RT-PCR of respiratory specimens or blood specimens to detect novel coronavirus nucleic acid-positive or viral gene sequencing, which are highly homologous with known novel coronaviruses. Although the detection of novel coronavirus in respiratory specimens by RT-PCR can generally obtain results within 4\u20136 hours [5], various factors can ultimately affect the accuracy of nucleic acid detection results, and false-negative results can occur. Recently, a study compared the sensitivity of RT-PCR and CT in COVID-19 detection among 1014 patients, and found that 59% had positive RT-PCR results, while 88% had positive chest CT scans, suggesting that the sensitivity of CT was 97% based on positive RT-PCR results in detection of COVID-19 [6]. Researchers recently found that in use of CT and nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of COVID-19, there are more factors that cause false-negative results during nucleic acid detection [7]. Therefore, chest CT is an important supplementary tool for RT-PCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and has irreplaceable significance.",

In the early stage (commonly within 1 week of onset), single or multiple lesions were mostly noticed in the periphery of the lungs or under the pleura. With progression of disease, the GGO density gradually increased, and thickened small blood vessel shadows or local lobular septum thickening were seen. There are multiple lesions in advanced stage, which are manifested by increased GGO, partial fusion, or accompanied by consolidation, gradually increasing density, and bilateral asymmetric subpleural distribution. For the severe stage (critical illness), which is equivalent to the terminal stage of the disease, bilateral lung lesions showed diffuse and extensive further progression, and some of them present as \u201cwhite lung\u201d. The lesions developed rapidly, becoming solid, and, combined with GGO, bronchial inflation signs can be seen, which can increase by more than 50% in 48 hours.

Because there is often a certain time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization, unlike previous observations, the time of appearance of a patients\u2019 first symptoms was defined by carefully consulting the relevant case data in our study. The basic manifestations and dynamic changes of clinical symptoms and different CT scan intervals were observed and analyzed for the first time. This study showed that the early manifestations of the disease were mainly GGO, which represents acute tissue damage. With the development of the disease, GGO can be increased, enlarged, and partially fused, and a few lesions can also be directly absorbed, which is basically consistent with the most common conclusion of previous studies [13], that GGO is found 2\u20135 days after admission.

Some lesions may have fibrous cord shadow, which can appear from the beginning of absorption, and shows a gradually increasing trend. With the continuous review of CT, absorption decreased. We observed that the fibrous cord shadow was gradually reduced and the edge gradually became clearer or even completely disappeared. In 2 patients, the cord shadow partially disappeared after 19 days. This may be related to the exudative component of the lesion, which can be further observed in subsequent follow-up reviews. During the dynamic observation of the outcome of the disease, we found that the disease progressed significantly at 4\u20139 days, was most significant at 7\u20139 days (55.6%), then disease progressed slowly at 10\u201312 days and the absorption of the lesions become apparent, and the absorption of the lesions was obvious at 13\u201315 days (86.1%). These results differ from a previous study [13] reporting that patients with lung lesions progressed most obviously at days 6\u20139 of admission, and the absorption was more obvious at 10\u201314 days. This may be because our data were based on the onset time. If the time from symptom onset to hospital admission is excluded, the above conclusions are basically consistent.",

            "text": "As in previous studies, we assessed decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, as well as increased C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, and D-dimer [2,15]. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation often appeared in the early and middle stages of COVID-19 disease progression. The imaging manifestations were mainly ground-glass-like high-density shadows and consolidation shadows. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate returned to normal range in the terminal stage in some patients, perhaps due to the rapid increase of CRP and the acceleration of ESR when human tissue being inflamed and infected in the early and middle stages. However, in the late stage, inflammation and infection were gradually controlled, and the absorption and density of lung lesions were decreased. A recent study indicated remarkably higher ESR and CRP levels in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls [16]. Ma et al. [17] showed that the CT score was proportional to the onset time and CRP according to the CT performance score, which was also consistent with our results. A decrease in the lymphocyte ratio was also observed in this group of data. Previous studies [17] used a semi-quantitative description of chest CT involvement, and showed a negative correlation between CT score and lymphocyte count. In the present study, the relationship between lymphocyte count and imaging performance was not further observed, and will be further improved in subsequent studies. Results of prealbumin, total protein, albumin, and globulin indicated that most patients experienced a decrease in albumin during the onset of disease. Only part of the patients\u2019 albumin recovered to the normal range at the later stage of absorption. So far, no relevant report has been found on this topic. The possible causes are: vascular endothelial damage and capillary leakage caused by virus infection; or anorexia resulting in reduced nutrition intake, the catabolism of the body greater than the anabolism, resulting in the negative nitrogen balance of the body; or respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration, and other systemic diseases like low fever resulting in increased consumption. The specific causes need to be further explored.",
