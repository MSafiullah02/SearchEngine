We confirmed compatible histologic lesions of salmonellosis in 17 (94%) of 18 cases in which Salmonella Typhimurium was isolated and 11 (31%) of 35 cases in which another serogroup B Salmonella was isolated. Other agents of enteric disease that were concurrently detected in some cases included rotaviruses, coronaviruses, coccidians, and hemolytic Escherichia coli. However, none of these agents caused lesions consistent with those used to define salmonellosis in this report (Appendix Tables 1, 2) .",

In this study, we demonstrate a strong positive association between histologic lesions consistent with enteric salmonellosis and isolation of Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-. In most cases from which Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-or Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated, the severity of histologic lesions was similar. However, the percentage of cases in which histologic lesions consistent with enteric salmonellosis were present was lower for cases from which Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-(72%) was isolated than for cases from which Salmonella Typhimurium (94%) was isolated. Based on these data, we believe that Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-is a likely cause of enteric salmonellosis that has a similar or perhaps slightly lower pathogenic potential in swine than Salmonella Typhimurium. Pathogenicity studies are needed to further characterize the pathogenic potential and S. enterica and Swine Enteric Salmonellosis fitness of Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-compared with that of Salmonella Typhimurium in swine. We suspect that Salmonella I 4, [5] ,12:i:-has evolutionary advantages that have resulted in its predominance as one of the most common Salmonella serotypes responsible for swine enteric salmonellosis. Accordingly, it is essential to determine the putative attributes that facilitate its rapid spread and ecologic success. Specifically, antimicrobial drug resistance genes and genes that encode resistance to heavy metal micronutrients should be evaluated, given their current and common use in US swine production.",
