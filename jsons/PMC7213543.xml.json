Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were listed for countries to react to, and act on. Law is specifically addressed in SDG 161 (peace, justice and strong institutions), but it is clear that the other SDGs cannot be attained if the use and misuse of law are not addressed. In this article, we examine what law, international human rights law, can do for the health-related SDGs. We will strengthen the case of the World Health Organization (WHO) to put health at the centre of the SDGs, as health is a human right, and we will look at legal measures to ensure health for all. We also discuss the role of the law in addressing seven emerging health challenges.",

These conditions are noted in multiple United Nations and regional human rights treaties. For example, housing is noted in the UDHR, the ICESCR and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Safe and potable water is only listed in the ICESCR.
