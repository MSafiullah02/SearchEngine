The focus is on China and The Netherlands. State liability can arise if governments have been negligent in addressing the threat of the COVID-19 epidemic, specifically where they have created risks due to not implementing restrictions or not doing so in a timely manner, or otherwise have failed to protect public health and human lives. These issues are analysed with reference to international law and the laws of The Netherlands, which has a well-developedalbeit idiosyncraticsystem of state liability. 1 Of course, it is also possible that governments are liable for damages caused by measures to fight COVID-19. For example, regulations requiring the closure of cafes and restaurants will cause economic harm to the operators thereof. This kind of potential liability is not discussed in this article. It should be noted, however, that governments are likely to offer compensation for the damages caused by these measures.",

It has been argued that China has \"suppressed information about the [corona]virus, done little to contain it, and allowed it to spread unchecked in the crucial early days and weeks\". 6 Reportedly, the Chinese authorities waited seven weeks to institute a lockdown in Wuhan, despite knowledge of the virus's spread; by then, some five million people had already left Wuhan.",

If so, China is required to \"make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\". Provisions of Chinese law cannot justify an internationally a wrongful act. The term \"injury\" is defined to include \"any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State\". 11 Economic damage, lost profits and \"any financially assessable damage\", are covered as well. 12 Of course, China is not the only state that is exposed to international state responsibility; other states that have failed to meet their obligations vis-\u00e0-vis other states may be liable, too. For instance, it has been reported that Austrian ski resorts ignored COVID-19 outbreaks in order to avoid harm to their economies. 13 Such omissions by municipal or local governments are likely attributable to the state of Austria, and thus will entail Austria's state liability. The Netherlands, too, may be exposed to international state responsibility, although, unlike China, it may be able to invoke as a defence that the WHO also acted very late, due, in part, to its unwillingness to confront China. 14 Whether any of these states, in fact, will be held liable under international law is a political decision to be made by the states that suffered harm.",

On 29 January 2020, a member of the Parliament's Second Chamber requested an urgent debate on the COVID-19 outbreak, but his request was dismissed by the majority. 15 One day later, on 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\". 16 This followed a call by the WHO on 13 January 2020, after the first COVID-19 patient outside of China had been confirmed, for active monitoring and preparedness. On 21 February 2020, the WHO warned that \"the window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is narrowing and that the international community needs to act quickly\". To assist countries in preparing, the WHO published a checklist, which includes questions such as whether there are enough medical supplies. 17 In relation to public health, the government of The Netherlands is assisted by the State Institute for Public Health and the Environment (\"RIVM\"), which is part of the Ministry of Public Health, Well-being and Sports. 18 In the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic, the RIVM was effectively speaking on behalf of the Dutch government. As discussed below, the RIVM's communications caused much confusion, and some of them were incorrect, not supported by science or inconsistent with the WHO's recommendations. 19 With things spinning out of control, the Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, had to get up to speed on the issues and took over some of the communications in relation 13 to the policy measures. Three problems with the Dutch government's response to the COVID-19 outbreak are discussed below: (1) the objective pursued by the Dutch government in addressing the COVID-19 epidemic; (2) the delay in taking adequate response measures (travel restrictions, restrictions on social interactions); and (3) the lack of preparedness and transparency in addressing the outbreak. Before doing so, the next section briefly discusses the liability of the state for inadequate policy.",

The RIVM was in the driver's seat. 25 Once this objective became politically untenable, the new objective became creating \"herd immunity\". This objective also proved to produce significant backlash, as people began to realize that this would result in a peak of many deaths, particularly among the elderly and vulnerable. In response, the Prime Minister attempted to reframe the objective as \"controlled population immunity\". The current objective is unclear, but appears to be closer to minimization of COVID-19 deaths and suppression of the outbreak, although a week into the lockdown the political pressure to relax the measures is already building up.",

            "text": "On 3 February 2020, the RIVM announced that it is \"very well prepared if the virus makes it to The Netherlands\". 37 As the crisis unfolded, however, it became clear that the preparations were inadequate at various levelsthere were insufficient testing, tracing and monitoring capabilities, there were not enough masks and protective clothing and equipment, the capacity of hospitals and intensive care units appeared to be inadequate, 38 there was no system in place for the distribution of COVID-19 patients across hospitals and there was no system for population measurement of body temperature. 39 During the entire process of fighting the COVID-19 epidemic, the Dutch government gave the impression of trying to catch up with developments. The failure to test the population has been a key issue. Consistently, the WHO has recommended testing as the core element of the strategy to fight the epidemic. 40 The RIVM, however, restricted testing to only a few small groups; even healthcare professionals were not consistently tested. The north of The Netherlands, which had fewer COVID-19 cases, disagreed with the RIVM's recommendations and announced a broad testing programme. 41 It has also been argued that the RIVM's data are outdated. 42 Neither the RIVM nor the Dutch government has been transparent about the data and analysis underlying their recommendations and policy measures. No sound risk assessments, no models or scenarios and no cost-benefit analyses of alternative policy measures have been published. As discussed above, the objective of the COVID-19 policy has changed over time, and it is still unclear. In addition, neither a strategy nor an action plan was ever clearly articulated. The websites of the RIVM and the Ministry of Public Health provide only limited data and analysis; it is impossible to determine which data, analyses and assumptions the RIVM and the government have used to arrive at their forecasts and interventions. Public participation in the process is impossible. As a result of this mismatch and the resulting vacuum, in the initial phase, the RIVM, which has no democratic legitimacy, determined key policies, including the policy of preventing public concern and economic harm. After public outcry drew politicians into this policy-making process, most of the time, the RIVM continued to be in the driver's seat, as the politicians preferred to hide behind the science.",

In each case, negligent omissions and other careless or unlawful acts are triggers of potential state liability. In the case of China, its belated response and initial cover-up of the outbreak in Wuhan allowed the virus to spread beyond China. These omissions may well constitute an international wrong for which China is liable vis-\u00e0-vis other states that suffered damage, including economic damage, as a result thereof.",

Consequently, under Dutch tort law, the state of The Netherlands may be liable for damage caused by these omissions. The recent Supreme Court ruling in the Urgenda climate case provides further support for these kinds of claims. Causation will likely be a key issue, but the concepts of partial responsibility and proportional causation may help here. If the state must protect its citizens against the remote risks of climate change in the second half of the century, they surely must protect them against the immediate risks of COVID-19 in 2020. 46 In short, the COVID-19 epidemic may not be over when the infections have abated. States that have failed in controlling the spread of the virus are likely to be held accountable and, possibly, liable.",
