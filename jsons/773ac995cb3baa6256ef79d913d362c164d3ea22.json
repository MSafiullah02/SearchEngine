These decisions revolve primarily around resource allocation in intensive care units (ICUs) and whether a patient should undergo invasive ventilation. Certain vulnerable populations have already featured in the media as falling victim to an increasingly utilitarian response to the pandemic. Those of advanced years or with serious existing health conditions are being deprioritised, and in some cases have had DNACPR notices applied pre-emptively and without consultation. A further vulnerable population potentially at risk of such treatment during the pandemic is those who lack the capacity to make their own care decisions.",

However, owing to the pandemic, there are increased practical and normative challenges to following the requirements of the Act. Capacity assessments to determine the need for best interests decisions, as well as the best interests decisions themselves, are likely to prove more difficult in current circumstances due to a variety of obstacles. This may create a more paternalistic situation in decisions about the care of the cognitively impaired, which is at risk of taking on a more utilitarian focus. We look to these issues and consider whether there is a risk of patients who lack capacity to make their own care decisions being short-changed. Further, we suggest that a lasting impact on the care of cognitively impaired patients is a realistic expectation. As a result of these concerns, we assert the need for clinicians to remain aware of the requirements of the MCA 2005 and continue to promote the rights of patients who lack decision-making capacity even during the unprecedented pressures of the pandemic.",

This results in acute, fluctuating consciousness and temporary cognitive impairment. 1 Patients who would ordinarily have the capacity to make decisions relating to their care and treatment may therefore require best interests decisions to be made on their behalf, as per the MCA 2005. In order to determine whether a patient lacks capacity to make these decisions, a full capacity assessment must be performed. This involves testing the patient's ability to understand information relevant to a healthcare decision, retain it, and then weigh up the information before communicating their decision. Importantly, capacity is decision specific and a patient may lack capacity to make some decisions, but not others. i As delirium has a fluctuating course, it is also feasible that a patient may transiently regain capacity to make decisions relating to their care and treatment. Hence, assessment of the patient's capacity must remain under ongoing review. In the context of a pandemic, however, increasing pressures on doctors may impede on their ability to carry out capacity assessments in full.",

This might involve a translator if a person prefers speaking in their native language, or engagement with specialist services such as speech and language therapy (SALT). 2 Often, it takes time to arrange these additional services. It is also possible that these services will be stretched due to staff sickness or increased demand. For instance, SALT services may be required to support increasing numbers Current controversy of patients in regaining laryngeal function following intubation and ventilation. 3 Doctors may not, for these reasons, be able to take 'all practicable steps' as they usually would. It is also likely that their own ability to communicate with patients will be impaired, and the importance of both verbal and nonverbal communication has long been emphasised. 4 Although the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary to reduce cross-infection, wearing masks and eyewear may further disorientate a confused patient in an unfamiliar environment. The use of PPE may also be challenging for patients who, for example, are hard-of-hearing and reliant on their ability to lipread.

ICUs may currently be leaving specialist care decisions to those from relevant specialties with the necessary expertise, but it is possible that during the peak of the pandemic the finite number of such specialists will be insufficient to do so. There are also concerns that this shortage may be worsened by late presentations not related to COVID-19. Seeking not to overwhelm the NHS, patients are choosing not to seek medical attention when they otherwise would have, which is reflected in the 29.4% decrease in the total number of attendances to accident and emergency in March 2020 as compared with the same time last year. 5 This is resulting in later presentations which require more medical attention. For example, a patient with a heart attack may not seek medical attention and later present with heart failure, requiring the attention of clinicians with specialist knowledge. 6 This additional strain on senior staff from relevant specialties may necessitate decision-making by less senior staff, potentially from other specialties. If such staff have been redeployed from areas where best interests decisions are uncommon, they may lack the experience to ensure these decisions are made properly.

However, here rests another challenge to the practice of best interests during the pandemic. The risk of infection has resulted in most hospitals stopping or significantly limiting patient visiting. Consulting those close to patients when making best interests decisions, then, will have to be done remotely. Some trusts are introducing virtual visits for patients who do not have suitable devices of their own, 8 but this might still limit the ability of consultees to communicate with the patient in order to best represent their preferences. If a patient communicates nonverbally, relatives are often best placed to communicate with them as they are more aware of how to interpret visual cues. For example, in a recent case before the England and Wales Court of Protection (EWCOP)-which we will soon discuss-the patient's mother disagreed with the Trust about her daughter's limited ability to communicate, and noted how her daughter became animated at the suggestion that she was going to challenge the Trust. 9 Such communication may not be possible through video call, which could affect the role of the consultee in decisions and result in the patient's perspective being lost.",

This is reflected in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) COVID-19 guidance on critical care for adults which clarifies that comorbidities and underlying health conditions ought to be considered in all cases. 12 While the GP surgery and care home examples were not directly best interests decisions, it is probable that at least some of the patients and residents would have lacked capacity to consent to a DNACPR notice. It is also worth noting that NICE recently faced heavy criticism, and were threatened with judicial review 13 for advocating the use of Current controversy the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) to determine the suitability of all adults for hospital treatment in their initial COVID-19 guideline for critical care. iii Through this scoring system, a person unable to carry out high-order, independent activities of daily living would be scored '5', thereby classifying them as 'mildly frail'. The NICE guideline suggested that it may not be appropriate to provide patients with a score of 5 or more with hospital treatment. This classification was thought to unfairly discriminate against individuals with stable cognitive impairment, such as those with learning disabilities or autism. The CFS has since been declared as unsuitable for assessing frailty in patients with learning disabilities or under the age of 65. Instead, an individualised approach to assessing escalation of treatment has been deemed necessary, in consultation with family and/or paid carers. 14 However, the utilisation of the CFS in the initial guideline demonstrates that the pressure to develop rapid national guidance has resulted in considerations of its application being overlooked, particularly in relation to vulnerable populations.",

In order to increase bed capacity in acute NHS hospitals, the Coronavirus Act 2020 established that there is no longer a legal duty to provide NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) assessments to determine the care and residential needs of patients who are medically fit for discharge from hospital. Without these assessments, patients may be discharged into an environment over which they have little choice. While hospitals will have a duty to ensure they are discharged into a safe environment which meets their care needs (for example, home with a care package or a community hospital), patients have temporarily lost access to the mechanism through which they can explore their care or residence options free of charge. This emergency legislation has been justified in the context of the pandemic, serving the greater purpose of freeing up acute hospital beds. However, the impact of this on patients who lack the capacity to make decisions on their discharge is particularly concerning. As Ruck-Keene notes, there is considerable overlap between patients with impaired decisionmaking capacity and continuing healthcare needs, and their discharge options have been significantly narrowed by this legislative change. 16 Rather than a multidisciplinary exploration of the values and preferences of the patient, in which the views of consultees are taken into account, a decision will be made by the patient's medical team to ensure the patient's safety and facilitate a quick discharge. Though these patients will have access to CHC assessments following the emergency period, there will invariably be a backlog creating further delays in determining what care and residential support is in the patient's best interests.",

As we hit the peak, it is unlikely that all patients will be able to receive life-saving care and yet more difficult decisions will have to be made. For instance, decisions about the discontinuation of the treatment of patients already receiving intensive care will have to be made. In such situations, Wilkinson reinforces the equivalence thesis in noting no difference between withholding and withdrawing treatment ceteris paribus. 17 When this point is reached, cognitively impaired patients ought not to receive special treatment, but also not lesser treatment on the basis of their impairment. Doctors making decisions about the continuation of intensive care for cognitively impaired patients during the pandemic should be especially conscious of any resource allocation influence.",

Not providing care on a utilitarian basis, factoring in the patient's cognitive impairment, is against the principles of the MCA 2005. Indeed, it begins to erode the rights of these patients under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 19 What seems more realistic, then, is that this will have a lasting impact. That is not to say that there will be a prevailing assumption that patients who lack decision-making capacity ought not to receive intensive care. Such a situation has not arisen amidst the pandemic and is unlikely to. Rather, the basis that a cognitively impaired patient ought not to have their care affected because of that impairment may be undermined. There could be a mirroring of decisions made during the pandemic outside of emergency situations in the future, with doctors questioning more the value of invasive procedures to preserve the life of such patients.",

Nonetheless, there are certain values which should not be easily side-lined, including the protection of the right of patients lacking decision-making capacity to have decisions about their care made in their best interests. Early responses to the pandemic have demonstrated a devaluing of the more vulnerable in society. Coupled with the practical difficulties facing the best interests process, we suggest that there is a very real risk of decisions being made which are not in the best interests of cognitively impaired patients-especially if such patients become infected with the virus and require invasive respiratory support. This is not an assault on doctors. Doctors are under immense pressure handling the pandemic and have spoken out about how uncomfortable they are with some of the decisions they are being forced to make, especially given the lack of national guidance to ensure consistency in the decision-making process. However, it is important for them to uphold the principles of the MCA 2005 even under this pressure. In particular, doctors must consider the reasons behind decisions they are making about the care of patients who lack decision-making capacity-are they being made in the best interests of that patient, or are other factors influencing them? Of course, doctors retain a right not to provide care that they consider futile or harmful, but this must be carefully navigated. Further, supporting patients in making decisions where possible and the involvement of consultees in decisions remains both a requirement under the MCA 2005 and an ethical imperative, so efforts must be made to minimise the impact of practical barriers on broad involvement in treatment decisions.",
