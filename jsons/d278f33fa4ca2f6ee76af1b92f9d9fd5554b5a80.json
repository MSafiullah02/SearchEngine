The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM-SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country's response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed",

Then, different prediction networks are trained within each cluster, using countries that have a more advanced stage of the pandemic than Brazil, e.g. China, Italy, Spain, and the United States. Each networks is then used to make predictions on the Brazilian states belonging to the cluster on which it was trained.

We underline that the findings reported in this paper come from estimated data and cannot be completely guaranteed as being the final truth. However, they are important because they allow managers and even some region population, to have an idea about what the future holds for the pandemic dynamics.

These dynamics can vary across different regions as they depend on parameters such as pollution, demographic density, average age of the population, among others. Analyzing the actions taken to fight the virus, in both the social and economic spheres, there is a need for more realistic epidemiological data. Indeed, the use of local models, taking into account the reality of each region, state or municipality, can allow the authorities to take coherent decisions. Therefore, it is assumed that the spread of the virus follows some statistical model, which parameters can be tuned to represent different situations.",

In these approaches, the phase transitions of the disease are modeled as instantaneous rates in differential equations or as probabilities of transition in discrete time differences or matrix equations. These models provide accurate estimates of the position of the equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of the time an individual spends at each stage; therefore, they do not accurately capture the transitory dynamics of epidemics. Actually, the SEIR model has been tested at Italy [6] to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. It has been shown to underestimate peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and to substantially overestimate the persistence of the epidemic after the peak has passed [5] .",

(which was not certified by peer review) truth data prevents us from determining which of these models is the most precise. Despite somehow representing the Covid-19 dynamics, some of these traditional models (SIR, SEIR, SEITR, SEIRD) must be improved so that they can be applied with higher precision to the study of the new virus, as they have been shown to present some issues on the recent works cited above. In this work, besides discussing the main advances of the contributions in this direction, these traditional models are compared to ours, which is a data driven approach. Some preliminary studies on the above methods have been conducted for better understanding of the Covid-19 dynamics. In fact, we verified that it is a virus that cannot be model perfectly with any specific traditional model because of the influence of several factors on its dissemination speed. Mainly, it is difficult to model its behavior because of the non-linearity of infection data caused by under-notifications and also the lack of effective and constant counter measures, which changes all the time as the infection spreads. For these reasons, it seems appealing to apply AI-based methods. As a first test, we start by implementing an LSTM, one of the default neural network models for analyzing time series data, in the next section.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a family of architectures containing recurring feedback connections, which define an internal state, or short-term memory. This memory makes them suitable for modeling sequential or time series data [17] . To this end, a standard RNN keeps a vector of activation parameters at each time step, especially when short-term dependencies are included in the input data. However, when trained with gradient descent algorithms, learning the long-term dependencies that are encoded in data becomes difficult due to the vanishing gradient problem. This is solved using a specialized neuron for long-term memory that keeps a constant reverse flow in the error signal, allowing it to learn long-term dependencies.

So the curve is not a distributions in the sense usually meant in probability and statistics. Nonetheless, one can visually notice that the curve of daily confirmed cases \u00d7 time (day) looks like a distorted Gaussian, and can actually be approximated by some distributions such as the normal (rarely), pearson, logistic, logNormal, and gamma, among others.

For example, the preliminary results reported by Bastos and Cajueiro in April 1st [32] , using SIR and SIAS, are far from being accurate. Indeed, they suggest that 30 million people will get infected in Brazil on May 11th (pandemic predicted peak) in the less infected people situation.",

Several countries are under-testing their population, making the number of reported cases below reality. Even for the countries that are doing massive testing, there are often delays between the real occurrences and notification. Another potential source of error is the randomization of the weights, which can be solved with LSTM-SAE [17] , however the first issue still remains a problem here (non-linearity problem).

Actually, we conjecture that the input data can be considered quasi-linear (somehow between nonlinear and linear) and that it obeys a certain pattern, otherwise no model could approximate it. The limited latent space is also a problem, even more for the long sequences as it is the case here. Besides modeling well the long-term memories, it fails in regularizing for other sequences with different properties [27] . That is to say that if a certain situation (lock-down or distancing) is kept, thus it could perform better.

By our results, this approach performed better than traditional and LSTM approaches. To do that, we have proposed an initial clustering of the training data based on Early Mortality, Days until 10x, and Early Acceleration using data from regions where the pandemic is at an advanced stage. Then, we used the deep learning MAE approach to train a neural network guided by this clustering. This approach worked better, verified at the end by fitting approximating curves to the dynamics of each Brazilian state, in order to verify or ratify the peaks. So, with basis on the results discussed above, up to date, we could verify the applicability of data driven approaches to model Covid-19 dynamics. With this approach, dealing with regional aspects based on the used features of the pandemic, city managers can get more precise information and better insight to plan their actions.
