In all 58 patients, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays of nasopharyngeal samples were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median age of the patients was 63 years, and the median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at the time of neurologic examination was 52 (interquartile range, 37 to 65, on a scale ranging from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness). Seven patients had had previous neurologic disorders, including transient ischemic attack, partial epilepsy, and mild cognitive impairment.",

Agitation was present in 40 patients (69%) when neuromuscular blockade was discontinued (Table 1) . A total of 26 of 40 patients were noted to have confusion according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU; those patients could be evaluated when they were responsive (i.e., they had a score of \u22121 to 1 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale, on a scale of \u22125 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]). Diffuse corticospinal tract signs with enhanced tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes were present in 39 patients (67%). Of the patients who had been discharged at the time of this writing, 15 of 45 (33%) had had a dysexecutive syndrome consisting of inattention, disorientation, or poorly organized movements in response to command. is a diagnostic algorithm for determining the presence or absence of delirium on the basis of four features: acute change or a fluctuation in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. \u00a7 One of the three ischemic strokes had the appearance of subacute infarcts on MRI and probably existed before SARS-CoV-2 infection. \u00b6 The seven lumbar punctures were performed in seven of the eight patients who underwent brain MRI and electroencephalography (one lumbar puncture was contraindicated because of anticoagulation). \u2016 The patient with oligoclonal bands with the same pattern in serum and the patient with elevated CSF IgG and CSF protein levels are different patients.",

S1 through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).

Enhancement in leptomeningeal spaces was noted in 8 patients, and bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion was noted in all 11 patients who underwent perfusion imaging. Two asymptomatic patients each had a small acute ischemic stroke with focal hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and an overlapping decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, and 1 patient had a subacute ischemic stroke with superimposed increased diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient signals.",
