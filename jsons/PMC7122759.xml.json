Many epidemiological studies soon identified HBV infection as a global chronic disease, with the highest prevalence rates in Asia and Africa. Before vaccination programs in these two continents, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was generally above 15%. More than four billion people have been chronically infected with HBV worldwide.

In East Asia, maternal to fetus (vertical) or perinatal infection results in an 80\u201390% persistent infection rate. This rate decreased to around 23% when infection occurred at preschool age, and decreased further to 2.3% when infection occurred at college student age [4]. In African, early termination of HBV replication would prevent maternal-fetal infection. Most chronic HBsAg carriers in Africa contract HBV infection in the early stage of life by horizontal transmission.

A trend of decreased immune-related gene expression was found for the period shortly after human migration out of Africa (Fig. 16.1a). Higher expression genotypes for IL-28B, interferon lambda 4, complement factor B, and CD40 are more prevalent in Africans than in either Europeans or South Asians [13]. In addition, when human migration reached the Indochina Peninsula, there was a sharp geography change from the flat land in Bangladesh to the mountainous and forested area of Chinese Dai. The latter environment in China and the Indochina Peninsula harbors a great diversity of plants and animals. Regions with higher plant and animal biodiversity often also feature an increased range and abundance of vector- or non-vector-borne diseases. Accordingly, the inhabitants of these areas should be able to handle an increased number of unfamiliar micro-organisms. Those subjects who demonstrate direct and strong immune responses may die of cytokine storm in fulminant hepatitis, SARS, influenza, or other infections. Therefore, the persistent HBV infection-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on HLA-DP and -DQ loci could be an adaptive evolutionary response to the local environment.",

We do not know why HBeAg positive patients in the immune tolerance phase gradually progress to the immune clearance phase. One explanation is that our innate immunity is continuously challenged by microorganisms and environmental substances. The strength of the innate immune response thus increases with age. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) is high in pre-term infants, progressively declines over the first year of life, and is lowest in adults [19]. In contrast, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) gradually increases with age. This age-associated change and other unclear cofactors may orchestrate an immune clearance reaction once a break point is reached.",
