            "text": "Healthcare workers face many stressors that are specific to their profession, such as a perceived imbalance between effort and reward (Kluska et al., 2004, McGillis-Hall and Kiesners, 2005, Weyers et al., 2006) exposure to workplace violence (Duncan et al., 2001, Fernandes et al., 1999), the burden of patients\u2019 emotional needs and suffering, and the personal impact of the constraints that the healthcare system imposes on care (McGillis-Hall and Kiesners, 2005, Spence-Laschinger et al., 2001). The high prevalence of professional burnout (Aiken et al., 2002a, Embriaco et al., 2007) indicates that long-term stress takes a toll. In addition to the cost to individuals, the conditions that contribute to stress may also make recruitment and retention of professionals more difficult and may affect patient outcomes (Aiken et al., 2002a, Aiken et al., 2002b, Gunnarsdottir et al., 2009). Although workplace characteristics that influence stress have been identified (Aiken et al., 2002b, Kivimaki et al., 2004, Spence-Laschinger et al., 2001) less is known about individual differences between healthcare workers which contribute to the impact of stress. Identifying the determinants of healthcare workers\u2019 resilience or vulnerability to life stress may lead to better individual health, and in turn enhance patient-provider interaction and quality of care.",

In particular, the purpose is to determine (i) the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences in hospital workers, and (ii) if the experience of childhood adversity affects how healthcare workers respond to contemporary stressors. We expected that childhood exposure to trauma or adversity would result in vulnerability to stressful events later in life. Thus, based on a diathesis-stress model, it was hypothesized that healthcare workers who had experienced trauma or adversity as children would experience two adult outcomes that demonstrate vulnerability to stress: (i) a steeper slope of the correlation between adult life events and subsequent psychological distress; and (ii) more days off work due to stress or illness. Because it has been reported that exposure to multiple types of childhood trauma is highly predictive of symptom outcomes (Finkelhor, Ormrod, & Turner, 2007) we also investigated the impact of experiencing more than one type of trauma.",

The Impact of SARS Study took place in Canadian hospitals 13 to 23 months after the 2003 outbreak of SARS. It included several variables that are relevant to the purpose of the current study, including measures of lifetime experience with trauma, life events over the 6-month period before the study and measures of subjective distress and occupational impairment. The study also measured ways of coping, social support and subjective response to stressful events, which are possible mediators or moderators of stress response that could also be affected by childhood adversity.",

Much research on the effects of childhood adversity has been conducted on clinical populations or in the community. The healthcare workers in this study, on the other hand, are neither selected for having health problems, nor are they necessarily representative of community norms. On the contrary, it is possible that these individuals are self-selected for resilience to stress, since they are all working, have persisted in healthcare work for many years (a median 20 years of healthcare experience) and have continued to work in their field 1\u20132 years after their SARS experience.",

            "text": "There have been few studies of the prevalence of childhood abuse and adversity in healthcare workers (deLahunta and Tulsky, 1996, Diaz-Olavarrieta et al., 2001, Gallop et al., 1995). In considering whether healthcare workers are representative of their communities with respect to their exposure to childhood adversity, at least two career-selection biases should be considered. First, it is possible that there is a force of selection in healthcare careers. Healthcare professionals have successfully navigated \u201cfilters\u201d of personal vulnerability in order to complete post-secondary education and maintain a career in a stressful workplace. Since severe childhood adversity is associated with a number of consequences that could disadvantage a person in these challenges (Horwitz et al., 2001, Spataro et al., 2004) there may be a selective pressure that, if acting independently, would result in a lower prevalence of childhood adversity among healthcare workers than is found in the community. The second possibility is that the experience of early life adversity influences an individual to wish to work in the healing professions (Jackson, 2001). It is consistent with this idea that while childhood maltreatment generally increases risk for mental health problems, a substantial minority of maltreated individuals have no such problems as adults (Collishaw et al., 2007). Ten percent of nurses with a personal history of childhood sexual abuse have indicated that their abuse had at least a moderate impact on their decision to become a nurse (Gallop et al., 1995). The latter force, acting on its own, would result in an elevated prevalence of childhood adversity in healthcare workers relative to the community. These are not mutually exclusive possibilities; it could occur that both selective forces and an influence toward a career in healthcare both influence the career of a given individual, and that individuals might differ from one another with respect to the influence of childhood adversity on career choice. Finally, for some individuals, the experience of childhood adversity may be irrelevant to career choice.",

It appears that the \u201cselection filters\u201d of higher education and persistence in a stressful occupation do not act independently to produce a cohort with a low frequency of childhood adversity. It is plausible that early experience with adversity leads some individuals to seek opportunities to care for others. This choice may be reinforced by many positive consequences, including increased self-esteem and self-efficacy, the satisfaction that accompanies altruism, the vicarious satisfaction of protecting others, and the benefits of being appreciated. At the same time, not every individual who chooses this path will have the resources and resilience to complete their education, train in a profession, and tolerate to stresses of a career in healthcare. Thus, it is possible that healthcare workers who have experienced abuse represent a biased sample which is skewed toward resilient outcomes of early abuse. Further research, incorporating measures of resilience, including constructs such as posttraumatic growth, self-esteem, and sense of coherence and directly comparing healthcare workers to members of the lay community could provide answers.",

Little is known about how a personal history of physical or sexual abuse affects a nurse's ability to practice her profession and how it alters the impact of work stress on her. On the positive side, the personal experience of severe adversity may lead a healthcare worker to be more attentive to the suffering of her patients, more alert to signs of unreported victimization, or more dedicated to helping others. However, personal experiences of abuse may also impair assertiveness and self-esteem (Gallop et al., 1995). Two studies have found the childhood sexual abuse is associated with depression, distress and low self-esteem in nursing students (Rew, 1989) and nurses (Gallop et al., 1995). Nurses who had experienced abuse identified that problems with self-worth, trust, and assertiveness affected their practice and relationships with other team members (Gallop et al., 1995).

We found a strong relationship between a history of childhood adversity and the number of life events that occur as an adult. Because this is a retrospective study, we cannot rule out the possibility that recent life events are spuriously increased in people with greater psychological distress due to recall or reporting bias. However, we believe that this explanation of the results is unlikely because most of the recent events which were probed require little interpretation or recall effort (e.g., In the last 6 months I purchased a house or car, I broke up with my partner, I had to ask for money from a bank, etc.). Furthermore, our retrospective finding is consistent with previous prospective research (Berkman, Leo-Summers, & Horwitz, 1992) which increases confidence in its validity.",

Compared with healthcare workers who did not experience childhood violence, abuse or neglect, healthcare workers with childhood adversity were both much more likely to experience a high number of life events and greater psychological distress. We were unable to directly test the hypothesis that the experience of childhood adversity moderates the relationship between adult life events and psychological distress in healthcare workers (i.e., that childhood adversity results in a steeper slope in this relationship) for 2 reasons. First, life events were only significantly associated with distress above a threshold (6 major events/6 months in this sample). Second, the subsample for whom a difference between groups could be tested (healthcare workers with more than 6 major events/6 months) was under-powered for detecting an interaction. Thus, the failure to distinguish between the slopes in healthcare workers with adversity (rho = .50) and those without childhood adversity (rho = .32), among healthcare workers with a high number of life events, may be due to Type II error.",

Since childhood maltreatment has previously been linked to avoidant types of coping (Griffing et al., 2006) and responses to the SARS outbreak were typified by avoidant and distancing strategies in general (Maunder, 2004, Maunder et al., 2006) the nature of the event may have minimized between-group differences.",

For example, a lifetime prevalence of major depression of 11.9% in this largely female, middle aged cohort is similar or lower than is found in the general Canadian population (Patten, 2000) and was not more common among workers with a history of violence, abuse or neglect. Resilience to childhood adversity is recognized as a common outcome but the sources of resilience are not fully understood (Collishaw et al., 2007).

The Impact of SARS study was designed to study the long-term stressful impact of an infectious disease, not to provide an estimate of the prevalence of sexual and physical abuse in healthcare workers. This analysis is thus subject to the limitations that result from performing a secondary analysis on data that were collected for a different purpose. For example, the gender distribution in this study is unbalanced, which limits conclusions about male healthcare workers. Participants were recruited from medical and surgical units based on their willingness to participate, which means that self-selection due to variables that are related to abuse history is possible. We have addressed this concern by performing a second survey (participation rate = 99%) that compared participants in the Impact of SARS Study to their nonparticipating colleagues working in the same unit. There were no differences with respect to age, gender, healthcare experience, profession and the degree to which they found SARS to be a negative experience (Maunder et al., 2006) which suggests that any biases that are due to self-selection are subtle. We had extensive psychological data to compare participants in the full Impact of SARS survey (n\n = 769) and those in the second wave study reported here (n\n = 176) and so we can be very confident that the smaller group is not a psychologically biased sample (Lancee et al., 2008). The use of a self-report questionnaire and the use of the word \u201cabuse\u201d within the questionnaire may have resulted in lower rates of abuse than would be found by interview or with questions requiring less interpretation. Retrospective reporting of coping, 1\u20132 years after the event, is prone to inaccuracy due to biased recall (Ptacek, Smith, Espe, & Raffety, 1994).",
