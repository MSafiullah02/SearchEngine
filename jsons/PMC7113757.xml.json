The single open reading frame is divided into three regions: P1, encoding the structural proteins, and P2 and P3, encoding the nonstructural proteins. In some viruses, the P1 region is preceded by a small leader (L) protein. The viral polyprotein is cleaved by viral proteases resulting in the release of the viral proteins and some stable precursors. In all picornaviruses, the 3C protease (3Cpro) is responsible for the majority of the cleavages within the viral polyprotein. Some picornavirus genera encode an additional protease. 2Apro, expressed by members from the genus Enterovirus, cleaves between the P1 and P2 regions. Lpro, expressed by Aphthovirus and Erbovirus members, autocatalytically cleaves itself from P1 at its C terminus.",

Cleavage of eIF4AI by FMDV 3Cpro and poly(A)-binding protein by enterovirus 2Apro and 3Cpro also contribute to the host shut-off (Joachims et al., 1999, Li et al., 2001).",

As yet, no anti-viral therapy has been approved to treat picornavirus infections. Most human pathogens can be found in the genus Enterovirus, e.g., poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (HRV). These viruses cause a variety of diseases including acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, respiratory infections, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an Aphthovirus member, is one of the most important animal pathogens, causing outbreaks among livestock with enormous economical impact.",

AG7088 is an irreversible peptidomimetic with an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester. Further studies revealed that AG7088 was also able to inhibit replication of other enteroviruses (De Palma et al., 2008b, Lee et al., 2008, Patick et al., 1999, Tsai et al., 2009). However, the clinical development was halted because of limited activity in clinical trials with natural HRV infections (Patick et al., 2005). AG7404 (also known as compound 1) is an analogue of AG7088 with improved oral bioavailability (Dragovich et al., 2003). AG7404 displays anti-viral activity in vitro and is safe and well-tolerated in vivo, but clinical development was discontinued (Patick et al., 2005). Recently, we reported the synthesis of a series of 3Cpro inhibitors, which, like AG7088, are peptidic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters (Tan et al., 2013). Of these series, the compound SG85 was the most potent inhibitor, with anti-viral activity against EV71, PV, echovirus 11, and HRV (Tan et al., 2013).",

However, such cell-free assays for compound testing have some drawbacks. First, compounds able to inhibit proteolytical activity in these assays may be unable to cross the plasma membrane. Secondly, in vitro assays are unable to assess cell toxicity. Thirdly, compounds that require cellular activation will not be identified as a hit in a non-cell-based assay. To deal with these issues, we have adapted a cell-based assay developed previously for EV71 3Cpro (Fig. 1\n) (Lee et al., 2008). We have extended the assay to multiple picornavirus 3Cpro and applied the assay to test the spectrum of 3Cpro inhibitors AG7088 and SG85. We demonstrate that our cell-based protease assay is an easy and biosafe assay for testing protease activity and the effect of inhibitors, and that it is amenable for use in high-throughput set-up.",

Expression of this reporter plasmid, pG5luc, is regulated by a transcription factor composed of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4BD) and the transactivating domain of VP16 (VP16AD). In between these domains, we inserted part of the CVB3 polyprotein containing 3Cpro and neighboring cleavage sites (\u03943A-3B-3Cpro-\u03943D). Proteolytical activity of 3Cpro leads to cleavage of the chimeric protein at the 3Cpro cleavage sites and as a consequence, the transcription factor lacks its VP16AD domain and no Fluc is expressed. However, in the case of an inactive protease no proteolytic cleavage occurs and the full-length fusion protein transactivates expression of FLuc. Renilla luciferase (RLuc), independently expressed from a different promoter on the plasmid expressing the protease construct, serves as a measure for transfection efficiency and indirectly for cell viability.",

Upon treatment with AG7088, a band of same molecular mass (i.e., \u223c53 kDa) was detected as in cells transfected with a 3Cpro construct that was rendered inactive by mutation of the catalytic site (C147A) (Lee et al., 2009), demonstrating that this was the uncleaved full-length product.

A major advantage of this assay is that it is cell-based, in contrast to most protease assays available. As a consequence, compounds that cannot penetrate the plasma membrane or have adverse cellular effects are selected out when searching for protease inhibitors. Another advantage is that the assay depends on an increase in read-out signal upon inhibition of protease activity.

One example for which our cell-based assay would be advantageous is NS2B/NS3pro of dengue virus (family Flaviviridae). NS3 protease activity is most commonly tested with a construct in which the polypeptide chains of the co-factor NS2B and the protease domain of NS3 are linked by a nonapeptide linker. Optimal activity of this construct in vitro requires a high pH of 9.0 potentially affecting the protonation state of compounds and hence false-positive or false-negative hits in screens (Noble et al., 2010).",

Active protease cleaves the chimeric protein at the 3Cpro cleavage (arrow). If the protease is catalytically inactive, binding of GAL4BD to the GAL4 sequences in the reporter plasmid recruits VP16AD to the transcription start site, resulting in induction of FLuc expression.

Cells co-transfected with the constructs for the indicated proteases and pG5luc reporter were treated with 50 \u03bcM AG7088 or SG85 and the next day the luciferase levels were measured. Displayed are the FLuc levels. (B + C) AG7088 and SG85, but not AG7404 inhibit FMDV 3Cpro, albeit with lower potency than CVB3 3Cpro. Cells co-transfected with pG5luc and the CVB3 or FMDV 3Cpro constructs were treated with a range of concentrations of AG7088 or AG7404 (B) or SG85 (C). The dashed lines represent the values obtained for the respective inactive mutants (upper dashed line) or the values obtained for the untreated wt constructs (lower dashed line).
