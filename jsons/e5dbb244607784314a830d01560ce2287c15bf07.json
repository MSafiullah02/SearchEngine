            "text": "Perioperative hemorrhage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are common in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Indeed, it is suggested that between 5 % and 7 % of cardiac surgical patients lose more than 2 L of blood in the fi rst 24-h postoperatively [ 1 ] . Similarly, it has been estimated that 1.5 % of patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy experience hemorrhage requiring at least four units of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion [ 2 ] , and up to 9 % of patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant experience abdominal bleeding requiring radiologic intervention or re-laparotomy [ 3 ] . Accordingly, anemia is frequently observed on admission to the ICU, with a substantial proportion of the remaining patients becoming anemic during their admission [ 4 ] . In addition, around 40 % of critically ill patients have thrombocytopenia or other derangements in coagulation parameters at some point during their ICU stay [ 5 -7 ] . Thus it is not surprising that blood product transfusion is common practice in the ICU. Indeed for decades, RBC, plasma, and platelet transfusions were given seemingly ubiquitously to alleviate their respective laboratory derangements. While these blood products clearly play a lifesustaining role in the setting of major trauma or life-threatening hemorrhage, in an era of evidence-based medicine, the safety and effi cacy of transfusion in hemodynamically stable patients has been increasingly called into question.",

            "text": "Though a degree of clinical equipoise persists, a substantial and growing body of evidence supports the notion that liberal transfusion of blood products portends an increased risk for adverse patient outcomes, including in-hospital and 30-day mortality, infection, ARDS, and multi-organ dysfunction [ 8 -10 ] . This, coupled with the known intrinsic risks of blood product transfusion (discussed below), has resulted in refi nement of transfusion recommendationswith a shift toward more conservative practice. Despite this, the ICU remains one of the highest utilizers of blood products in the hospital [ 4 , 11 ] . In the United States, an estimated 24,000,000 blood products are transfused each year [ 12 ] , with approximately 40 % of critically ill patients receiving at least one unit of RBCs [ 4 ] , and one out of every two patients receiving at least one allogeneic blood product during their ICU admission [ 11 ] . Concerningly, evidence suggests that many of these blood product transfusions are being given outside of published guidelines-for example, for the correction of stable asymptomatic anemia, or for correction of abnormal coagulation parameters in the absence of bleeding [ 13 ] . Improving the appropriateness of blood product transfusion in the ICU will require careful assessment of the known risks and benefi ts. In this chapter, we outline the contemporary evidence-based indications for blood product transfusions, their effi cacy and risks. In addition, we describe recent changes with regard to massive transfusion as well as upcoming blood product alternatives.",

While advances in donor screening and blood product testing have substantially mitigated concerns regarding transfusion-transmitted disease, the debate about RBC safety is ongoing-primarily driven by questions of effi cacy and other patient-important outcomes. In 1999, the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) randomized trial compared a liberal (transfusion trigger, Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (transfusion trigger, Hb < 7 g/dL) transfusion strategy and concluded that in-hospital mortality was signifi cantly reduced in the restrictive group [ 20 ] . While this study failed to demonstrate a statistically signifi cant difference in 30-day mortality for \"all comers,\" subgroup analysis of 30-day mortality in those with lower APACHE II scores (<20) and <55 years of age was signifi cantly reduced in the restrictive group [ 20 ] . Importantly, no adverse effects of the restrictive strategies were observed, however noticeably fewer RBCs were utilized [ 20 ] . This study was pivotal to modern transfusion practice, and subsequently leads to the generation of guidelines purporting a transfusion trigger of Hb < 7 g/dL. Similar studies have replicated these fi ndings in a variety of patient populations including cardiovascular [ 21 ] and orthopedic surgery [ 22 ] as well as gastrointestinal bleeding [ 23 ] , each concluding that either liberal transfusion did not confer a morbidity or mortality benefi t, or that restrictive transfusion actually resulted in a higher probability of survival at 6 weeks, less bleeding, and fewer complications relative to the liberal transfusion group [ 21 -23 ] . In addition, a number of observational studies support restrictive transfusion, noting that RBC transfusions may be associated with worse clinical outcomes [ 4 , 24 ] . These studies hypothesize that restrictive transfusion strategies result in reduced exposure to the potentially harmful effects of transfusion therapies, and as such result in a reduced incidence of adverse events when compared to liberal transfusion.",

Rather, consideration of patient-specifi c symptoms and risks is paramount, and clinical judgment should be exercised with each blood product that is administered. In modern medical practice, efforts to minimize unnecessary RBC transfusion are hinged upon three key points; fi rst recent evidence supports the notion that restrictive transfusion practice in hemodynamically stable patients is at least as safe and effective as liberal transfusion practice, and possibly superior. Second is the increasing awareness of the risks of transfusion, and third relates to the scarcity of RBCs, resource utilization, and the associated healthcare costs.",

Considering all available literature at that time, the single most irrefutable indication for RBC transfusion remains acute hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability, inadequate oxygen delivery or shock. Outside of the setting of acute hemorrhage, conservative transfusion practices (RBC transfusion only when Hb falls < 7 g/dL) are recommended for most critically ill patients with stable anemia, including those presenting with trauma, requiring mechanical ventilation or with known stable coronary disease. Furthermore, in all situations, it is recommended that only single unit transfusion takes place before reevaluation of the need for additional RBC transfusion. Notably, these guidelines recognize a possible exception to this standard of care. For patients with acute myocardial ischemia, it is suggested that transfusion for a Hb < 8 g/dL may be benefi cial. Of note, given the lack of clinical trials focusing specifi cally on the effects on anemia in acute myocardial ischemia, this recommendation was considered level 3 evidence [ 11 ] . Recent studies focusing specifi cally on the issue of transfusion in cardiac disease have taken place with confl icting results [ 30 -32 ] . This is discussed in more detail below-exceptional circumstances. However, the authors do highlight that RBC transfusion should not be considered as an absolute method to improve tissue oxygen delivery in the critically ill. With regard to sepsis and neurologic injury, the authors note that current data are insuffi cient to provide level 1 recommendations.",

Conversely, they also report the exception that in postoperative surgical patients, transfusion should be considered at Hb < 8 g/dL or less in the presence of symptoms such as chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia unresponsive to fl uid resuscitation, or congestive heart failure. The latter recommendation was largely informed by the results of the FOCUS trial [ 31 ] in which the authors examined the role of a more liberal threshold-based transfusion practice (<10 g/dL) versus symptom-driven (transfusion permitted if symptomatic with Hb < 8 g/dL) transfusion in patients with known cardiovascular disease who were undergoing surgery. These authors found no benefi t from liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (Hb < 8 g/dL or symptomatic) practice, however they refrained from making any specifi c recommendations regarding transfusion thresholds in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome.",

Specifi cally recommendations were to transfuse RBCs to maintain a hematocrit > 30 % or to achieve a central venous oxygen saturation > 70 %, in addition to fl uid resuscitation, use of inotropic agents, respiratory support, and invasive cardiopulmonary monitoring [ 34 ] . While these international guidelines are broadly endorsed for the management of early sepsis, this study was not designed to specifi cally evaluate the risks and benefi ts of transfusion. Additionally, since RBC transfusion was just one of several interventions, the attributable benefi t is unclear. Indeed, specifi c guidance on the administration of RBC transfusion has been removed from the most recent iteration of the surviving sepsis guidelines [ 35 ] . Moreover, data exist to suggest an immunomodulatory effect of RBC transfusion [ 36 ] , which may potentially propagate sepsis. Indeed, a recent systematic review noted a signifi cant reduction in healthcare-associated infections in patients receiving a restrictive transfusion strategy [ 37 ] . To this end a recently completed multicenter randomized trial-Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) [ 38 ] -compared patient outcome with EGDTdriven care protocols versus protocolized standard therapy which did not require transfusion versus standard care. These authors concluded that need for organ support, mortality at 90 days and 1 year were comparable between all three groups. The recently published Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial failed to support the need for more liberal RBC transfusion practices in those presenting with septic shock [ 39 ] . In lieu of further clinical data, the recommendation that each patient be assessed individually based upon symptoms and clinical need remains paramount, over arbitrarily defi ning a numeric transfusion trigger.",

Unfortunately, evidence relating to the optimum transfusion practice in this subgroup of patients remains limited. As such, guidelines for RBC transfusion in this specifi c population remain somewhat imprecise, particularly in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) . The generally accepted threshold in clinical practice is to transfuse these patients if their hemoglobin falls below 8 g/ dL [ 32 ] . To date, the strongest evidence specifi cally evaluating the role of transfusion in patients with cardiac disease comes from the FOCUS, TRACS, and MINT trials. In 2006, the FOCUS trial [ 31 ] found no benefi t from liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) versus restrictive (Hb < 8 g/dL or symptomatic) in terms of mortality, independent walking, or myocardial infarction. Similar notions were endorsed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists in their 2011 guideline [ 27 ] . Although their threshold was set at 6-7 g/dL, they again emphasize that patients' clinical condition should be the most important component of the clinical decision to transfuse, and that these decisions will often be multifactorial.",

Interestingly, patients enrolled in the TRICC study [ 40 ] were evaluated for cardiac events, including myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Evaluation of the entire cohort indicated that there was no evidence for an increase in adverse cardiac events in the restrictive group; however, subgroup analysis of patients with ischemic heart disease suggested a nonsignifi cant trend toward increased mortality at 30 and 60 days in the restrictive group [ 40 ] . This study was unfortunately underpowered to evaluate such an association, however these fi ndings raised signifi cant concern to warrant further investigation. In 2008, a single-center observational study published data relating to their experience of transfusion in ACS [ 32 ] . After careful adjustment for confounding variables, the authors concluded that transfusion appeared to be protective in the setting of a nadir Hb < 8 g/dL but harmful if nadir Hb was > 8 g/dL [ 32 ] . Following this observation, the TRACS study was established to evaluate the safety of restrictive perioperative RBC transfusion following elective cardiac surgery. These authors concluded that restrictive transfusion was noninferior when compared to liberal perioperative RBC transfusion [ 21 ] . In an effort to further clarify the optimal RBC transfusion threshold in the setting of ACS, Carson et al. conducted a pilot study (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion-MINT) addressing this very issue [ 30 ] .",

Subsequently, Naidech and colleagues described an association between increased cerebral infarction and death in anemic patients with neurologic injury [ 43 ] , promoting adoption of a more liberal transfusion practice aiming to keep Hb > 10 g/dL. The primary hypothesis underpinning this observation was that the adverse outcomes associated with anemia were secondary to impaired oxygen delivery to the brain.

It has been postulated that a rapid decline in S-nitrosohemoglobin concentrations, with resultant reduction in red cell deformability, can result in microcirculatory occlusions and subsequent tissue ischemia [ 55 ] . Meanwhile, others have suggested an immunomodulating effect of RBCs may be causal [ 36 ] . Additional adverse biochemical effects associated with RBC storage include reductions in ATP and 2,3-DPG [ 56 , 57 ] . While there is little debate regarding these and numerous other time-dependent changes in both the RBCs themselves as well as the storage supernatant, the clinical impact of these changes remains unclear. Although observational data clearly suggest an association between prolonged storage and adverse recipient outcomes [ 58 ] , these fi ndings have not born out in the available, albeit small clinical trials [ 59 ] . More importantly, several recent multicenter clinical trials have failed to confi rm the clinical signifi cance of the RBC storage lesion. Nonetheless, the absence of strong data suggesting effi cacy, combined with the known risks associated with RBC transfusion (discussed in detail below) suggest that a restrictive RBC transfusion practice is prudent until further data become available.",

Plasma also contains fats, carbohydrates, and minerals in concentrations similar to those in the circulation of donors at the time of product collection. Of note, multiple plasma products are available in clinical practice including fresh frozen plasma (FFP) , plasma frozen within 24 h (FP24) , thawed plasma, jumbo plasma, and cryoprecipitate-reduced plasma.

FFP is frozen within 8 h of collection, stored at between \u221218 \u00b0C and \u221230 \u00b0C [ 60 ] , and can be used up to 1 year after donation.

As such, clinical decisions relating to plasma transfusion should carefully weigh the risk-to-benefi t ratio. In 2011, the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey reported that almost four million units of plasma were transfused in the United States alone [ 14 ] . While guidelines exist for the use of plasma in specifi c care scenarios, indications are limited and equipoise remains in many clinical contexts [ 28 , 61 , 62 , 64 ] . Worryingly, despite a lack of evidence, approximately 30 % of transfusions are believed to be administered outside of published guidelines [ 66 , 67 ] . Nationally, there are inconsistencies in plasma transfusion practice, with the most commonly cited rationale being efforts to correct abnormal pre-procedural international normalized ratios (INR) in non-bleeding patients [ 13 ] . This rationale is based on the assumption that an elevated INR correlates with increased bleeding, and that plasma transfusion will normalize the INR and prevent bleeding complications. Importantly, however, this indication is generally not supported by current evidence and is not endorsed as an indication for plasma transfusion by most society guidelines [ 61 , 68 ] . When considering the available evidence suggesting a poor correlation between mild-to-moderate INR abnormalities and peri-procedural bleeding complications [ 69 ] , attempts to correct INR through plasma transfusion appear to be ineffective and unnecessarily expose patients to the risks associated with plasma administration.",

In the absence of massive hemorrhage, current guidelines suggest a typical dose of plasma around 10-15 mL/kg predicted body weight [ 63 ] . This dose is expected to raise clotting factor levels by 25-30 % [ 62 ] . Thus the average 70 kg patient would require approximately 1 L of plasma to reverse coagulopathy, assuming ongoing factor losses had ceased. Recent efforts suggest that these dosing regimens may be inadequate, noting suboptimal correction of actual in vivo coagulation factor content [ 71 ] . In an investigation specifi cally addressing this issue, upwards of 30 mL/kg of plasma were needed to reliably increase coagulation factor content to desired levels [ 71 ] . The issue of under-dosing plasma replacement has come to the forefront in the setting of massive transfusion where far more liberal plasma transfusion practices (e.g. 1 unit of plasma for every unit of RBC administered) are now frequently endorsed.",

While its utility in this setting was originally endorsed to prevent bleeding, more recently numerous studies have documented that INR poorly predicts bleeding risk in these patients and that response to plasma is both unpredictable and short-lived [ 73 ] . Opponents of this indication cite concerns regarding both the level of true underlying coagulopathy (as inferred by an elevated INR) and plasma's effi cacy in this population [ 74 ] . This stems from our knowledge regarding the inherent differences in clotting factor levels and anticoagulant proteins as compared to patients without liver disease. As such, this practice is not strongly supported (Grade C recommendation, Level IV evidence) [ 61 ] . This topic is discussed below-effi cacy.

While there is some discrepancy in the literature regarding the optimal ratio of plasma to RBCs [ 76 ] , a systematic review by Roback and colleagues in 2010 found that overall, use of a plasma:RBC ratio greater than 1:3 was associated with a reduction in mortality and multiorgan failure [ 64 ] . However, a concern with the majority of the observational studies that have suggested benefi t with liberal plasma transfusion is the issue of survival bias [ 76 , 77 ] . Moreover, a growing body of evidence has linked liberal plasma transfusion to adverse outcomes in those who do not ultimately experience massive hemorrhage [ 76 -80 ] . In light of these concerns, we endorse the need for more defi nitive clinical trials to determine the optimal strategy for coagulation factor replacement in this setting. The recently pub-lished PROPPR trial noted improved hemostasis with more liberal plasma administration (1 unit of plasma for every unit of RBC), but the primary outcomes of mortality at 24 h and 90 days did not improve with these more liberal approaches to plasma administration).",

Indeed, a number of reports have concluded that modest abnormalities in coagulation tests, such as INR, do not correlate well with surgical blood loss or the need for subsequent RBC transfusions [ 81 , 82 ] . Furthermore, the impact of plasma transfusion on outcomes is uncertain in the absence of bleeding. In part, these fi ndings can be explained by the nonlinear relationship between INR and plasma coagulation factor levels [ 13 , 83 ] . Since thrombus formation is directly proportionate to in vivo coagulation factor concentrations and not the INR, it is unsurprising that bleeding and hemostasis are therefore not well correlated with the latter. Indeed, though plasma transfusion will often correct a markedly elevated INR, the associated change in actual coagulation factor concentrations is frequently insuffi cient for adequate hemostasis [ 84 ] . In contrast, evidence suggests that it is often not possible to correct more modest elevations in the INR (e.g. INR 1.1-1.85), since the INR for a unit of plasma itself often falls above the normal range [ 66 , 69 ] .",

An important exception to this relates to patients with liver disease. In this setting, it has previously been demonstrated that INR values do not represent the same degree of clotting factor defi ciency as is seen with patients on Warfarin for any given INR. In fact, patients with liver disease will typically have lower levels of factor VII [ 86 ] . In addition, these patients are also typically defi cient in the anticoagulant protein \"Protein C\" [ 74 ] , therefore INR values and associated bleeding risk must be interpreted with caution in this context. Of note, a landmark study by Spector and colleagues demonstrated that transfusion of additional plasma in attempt to correct these patients' INRs typically only resulted in a temporary correction [ 87 ] . For this reason, and in view of the potential risks, the use of FFP in patients with liver disease remains controversial.",

Although platelet transfusion itself is not without risk, previous observational studies have demonstrated thrombocytopenia to be associated with major bleeding events, increased hospital and ICU lengths of stay, and mortality [ 94 ] . Unfortunately, few randomized trials have investigated platelet transfusion thresholds and their association with patient-important outcomes. At present, prophylactic platelet transfusions for specifi c platelet count thresholds (e.g. <10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) in critically ill patients continue to be supported in the literature [ 95 -97 ] . However, the literature also suggests that platelets continue to be given outside of these recommendations [ 98 ] . In 2007, Cameron and colleagues noted that non-cardiac surgical patients at their institution were typically transfused platelets outside of existing guidelines, with a mean platelet count of 85 \u00d7 10 9 /L [ 99 ] .

While some inconsistencies exist [ 113 , 114 ] , a large number of early human and animal studies demonstrated multiple benefi ts including decreased hemorrhage and increased survival [ 115 , 116 ] . More recently, Idris and colleagues have demonstrated that cryoprecipitate transfusion results in the expected rise in serum fi brinogen levels, with this benefi t appearing to be more pronounced in patients with acute versus chronic deficiencies [ 117 ] . Although this study did not directly evaluate the impact of cryoprecipitate transfusion on bleeding events, Lee and colleagues went on to study the impact on fi brinbased clot formation in cardiac surgical patients [ 118 ] . This study demonstrated cryoprecipitate transfusion both increased serum fi brinogen and the quality of fi brin-based clot formation assessed using thromboelastometry. In the same year, a large multicenter prospective observational study evaluated cryoprecipitate use in trauma patients [ 119 ] . These authors concluded that transfusion practice was highly variable between institutions, but that cryoprecipitate transfusion was not associated with in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, cryoprecipitate was recently demonstrated to independently add to survival benefi t in war casualties with hemorrhagic shock [ 120 ] . Despite this stepwise generation of promising data relating to cryoprecipitate use in recent years, recent literature puts a greater focus on the role of fi brinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates in these scenarios [ 121 -123 ] . This evolving topic is discussed in greater detail below under the heading massive transfusion. Importantly, randomized trials are necessary to better determine the clinical effi cacy and optimal dose for cryoprecipitate transfusion.",

In 2004, content experts from around the world convened and proposed what are now the most widely accepted criteria for TRALI [ 126 ] . These criteria defi ne TRALI as the new onset of acute lung injury (ALI) within 6 h of blood product transfusion in the absence of additional, temporally related ALI risk factors (Table 35 .1 ) [ 126 ] . In the presence of alternate ALI risk factors, patients are classifi ed as having \"possible TRALI.\" TRALI's true incidence has been a matter of debate over recent years with estimates ranging from less than 1 % in the broad population of all hospitalized patients, up to 8.2 % in certain high-risk surgical populations and the critically ill [ 125 , 127 -131 ] . In truth, the incidence of \"clean\" TRALI cases (no additional risk factors for ALI) is likely at the lower end of this spectrum, while the composite of TRALI/possible TRALI is likely best represented by the upper ranges. Regardless, a growing body of evidence suggests we frequently underestimate the rate of TRALI due to a number of fl aws in case identifi cation and reporting [ 132 -135 ] . Notably, TRALI is consistently noted to be the leading cause of transfusionrelated death reported to the FDA [ 12 ] .",

Thereafter, the passive delivery of donor antibodies in the blood component interact with cognate recipient leukocyte antigens-the \"second hit\"-activating sensitized recipient neutrophils, producing an infl ammatory reaction within the lung, and leading to infl ammatory lung edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome). As multiparous female donors are at risk of developing anti-leukocyte antibodies [ 145 ] ; numerous countries (including the US) have removed these individuals from the transfusable plasma donor pool. As noted above, these practices have been associated with signifi cant reductions in the rate of plasma-associated TRALI. Of note, a signifi cant number of TRALI cases have occurred in the absence of detectable donor antibody or cognate recipient antigen [ 146 , 147 ] . Such cases have led to the proposition of an alternative \"second hit\" that is thought most likely to be the result of infusing alternate soluble biologic modifi ers (e.g. neutral lipids, cell-free hemoglobin) that are also capable of activating sensitized neutrophils. For more detailed discussion on TRALI mechanisms, we note a number of excellent recent reviews [ 148 -150 ] . Unfortunately, there are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of TRALI and therefore management remains primarily supportive with oxygen supplementation and ventilator support when needed [ 151 ] . As with lung injury that occurs in the setting of alternative major risk factors for ARDS, low-tidal volume ventilation is recommended for patients with TRALI who require invasive ventilatory support.",

Importantly, data from prior reports do suggest that TACO is more prevalent in the critically ill. Frequently described as a less severe transfusion-related complication, it should be noted that Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) is the second leading cause of transfusion-related death, accounting for 34 % of the transfusion-related fatalities reported to the FDA in 2013 [ 12 ] and with a case fatality estimated to range between 5 % and 15 % [ 12 , 158 ] .",

Supporting data include identifi ed associations between volume of blood product transfused, rate of transfusion, overall volume status, and the presence of cardiovascular or renal disease [ 155 , 160 -162 ] .

Adverse reactions can be seen with non-ABO donor RBC antigens as well. Often, these interactions result in delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. The presence of anti-Kidd antibodies in the transfusion recipient provides an example. Similar reactions have also been noted with the Kell, Duffy, and Rh RBC antigen families [ 168 , 170 ] . Although AHTR are most frequently observed with RBC transfusion, similar reactions can be seen with out-of-group platelet transfusion if the transfusate contains a suffi cient amount of incompatible plasma.",

Febrile reactions typically present within 4 h of transfusion and manifestations are generally mild in nature. Occasionally, patients may experience more marked symptoms with rigors and chills.

These measures have substantially reduced, though not completely eliminated, the risk of TTIs-which are a particular concern for products stored at room temperature, such as platelets. Indeed, septic transfusions with bacterially contaminated platelets are thought to occur in 10.6 per million transfusions [ 181 ] . Presentation typically consists of fever, rigors, tachycardia, hypotension, and other features of bacteremia. Management of suspected TTI includes transfusion cessation, collection of recipient blood cultures, and initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics. The residual product should be retained for further testing by the transfusion laboratory and to enable quarantining of additional products collected from the implicated donor [ 182 ] .",

TIC is common (25-40 % of major trauma cases) and frequently presents very early following the trauma event, often prior to the initiation of signifi cant resuscitation [ 188 , 192 ] . TIC appears to occur when thrombin generation resulting from tissue injury co-occurs with shock. This combination leads to activation of the protein C system with a resultant hypocoaguable state, thus contributing to persistent bleeding [ 192 -194 ] . Additionally, dilution of both coagulation factor content and platelets resulting from large-volume resuscitation that is devoid of these blood constituents is believed to play a role in the development and propagation of TIC as well.",

To this end, early military data fi rst purported the use of a 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:plasma:platelet transfusion) theorizing that its composition more closely resembled whole blood and may prevent the occurrence of TIC [ 110 ] . Multiple subsequent studies , primarily in military populations, have noted improved survival with these massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) [ 108 , 109 , 196 ] .

A number of studies have compared FFP and PCCs at a dose of 25-50 IU/ kg and found that PCCs produce a more rapid and complete correction of the INR [ 219 -221 ] . To date, a single prospective randomized controlled trial has been undertaken to evaluate PCCs comparative safety and effi cacy [ 222 ] . In this study, Sarode et al. report non-inferiority of four-factor PCCs compared to FFP for the urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonists in non-surgical patients [ 222 ] . Additional favorable features of PCCs include the low volume infusion required to adequately replace coagulation factor content, thereby avoiding the risk of volume overload often encountered with FFP [ 222 ] . PCCs are also typically more readily available as their storage at room temperature negates the need for thawing and warming and they can be safely infused at a faster rate [ 223 ] . PCC administration is of course not without risk and reported adverse events include allergic reactions, HIT, and thromboembolic events [ 211 , 215 ] . Indeed, the latter is the primary concern precluding the widespread use of PCCs for urgent reversal of oral anticoagulation therapy. However, uncertainty remains with regard to whether the few documented thromboembolic events noted in prior studies truly related to PCC use versus patients underlying risk factors. While this potential risk remains under investigation, available data suggest that PCCs have a relatively good safety profi le [ 224 -226 ] .",

            "text": "Similarly, numerous investigators have begun exploring alternate potential applications for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Originally developed for the treatment of serious bleeding in hemophilia, rVIIa is commercially available as a lyophilized powder that is stored at 2-25 \u00b0C and reconstituted at the time of use with L -histidine in water to achieve an end volume of 7 mL [ 227 ] . Novel applications have been in the setting of bleeding in major surgery [ 228 -230 ] and trauma [ 231 ] as well as liver disease [ 232 ] , obstetric [ 233 ] , and intracranial [ 234 ] hemorrhage. While these observational studies and single-center clinical trials were encouraging, subsequent multicenter clinical trials have failed to reproduce analogous results in all clinical scenarios. Although Gill and colleagues reported a reduced incidence of reoperation for bleeding and RBC transfusion in patients treated with rFVIIa following cardiac surgery [ 235 ] , Boffard et al. noted that it was only effi cacious in the setting of blunt versus penetrating trauma [ 236 ] . Similarly, other investigators have described a lack of effi cacy in variceal bleeding [ 237 ] , hepatectomy [ 238 ] , intracranial hemorrhage [ 239 ] , and congenital cardiac surgery [ 240 ] . In the setting of anticoagulant reversal, results have been equally inconsistent. Importantly, despite the correction in laboratory coagulation parameters seen with rFVIIa, its ability to achieve hemostasis does not necessarily appear to correlate [ 241 , 242 ] . Perhaps more concerning is their questionable safety profi le. Indeed a recent large systematic review concluded that rFVIIa was associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic disease, particularly ACS [ 243 ] . Meanwhile others have noted an increase in venous thromboembolic disease [ 244 ] , and in cardiac surgical patients, incidence of stroke appeared to be increased [ 245 ] .",

Transfusionrelated complications can be life-threatening and are poorly recognized and inconsistently reported. In general, restrictive transfusion practices should be employed in the absence of major acute bleeding. In contrast, the transfusion community has increasingly endorsed the early and liberal use of blood products in the setting of trauma-related hemorrhagic shock. The role for novel therapeutics such as PCCs and fi brinogen concentrates as alternatives to traditional transfusion therapies appears to be expanding, although additional evidence is needed before such strategies are more broadly implemented.",
