The first phase of the disease is typically a mild, unremarkable viral illness, frequently influenza B or varicella. The second phase begins when the child is beginning to recover from the viral illness, and is associated with profuse and persistent vomiting. Behavioral changes, including lethargy, confusion, and combativeness can rapidly (within 4\u201360 h) progress to stupor, coma, and death.",

            "text": "Morphological and biochemical findings have led many to speculate that the primary insult in RS is an acute, self-limiting disturbance in hepatic mitochondrial structure and function (La Montagne, 1983; Mowat, 1983). There is a characteristic reduction in the numbers of liver rnitochondria. Those present are swollen dramatically with ultrastructural loss of their matrices and cristae (Daughtery et al., 1987). However, there is no evidence of cellular necrosis, and the mitochondrial distortions are completely reversed upon recovery from the disease. The biochemical changes are also indicative of a mitochondrial disease, since the metabolic pathways that are affected (urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation) are localized either in whole or part in the mitochondria (for review, see\nBrown and Forman, 1982). At least some products of the blockade of these pathways (e.g., ammonia, fatty acids) are potential neurotoxins, and have been implicated strongly in the encephalopathic phase of the disease. Serum ammonia levels are extremely high during the early course of the disease, and in some cases have been reported to be 60- fold higher than normal levels (Tang et al., 1975). (1989) recently reported that serum levels of both monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic fatty acids are elevated at certain stages of the disease. There is also evidence that the relative proportions of unesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids are increased in serum (Ogburn et al., 1982) and in erythrocytes (Schwarz et al., 1987) of RS patients. Contiguous with serum lipid abnormalities, the cells of the visceral organs, particularly the liver, are loaded with fat that is stored as microvesicular droplets (Brown and Forman, 1982). This may be closely associated with a loss of regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis (Kang et al,, 1982) and an increased uptake of fatty acids by the liver. Abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism have been inferred from amino acid profiles (Romshe et al., 1981) and depletion of hepatic glycogen (Brown and Forman, 1982). In spite of this generalized mitochondrial malfunction, cytosolic enzyme activity is normal in RS patients. Moreover, the hepatomegaly alone does not appear to explain the deaths of the children, as the liver is often recovering while the brain continues to deteriorate.",

(1989) have suggested that the diagnostic criteria of the CDC be reassessed, as it is now believed that Reye\u2019s Syndrome may actually be two distinct disease entities, with the infantile form (i.e., in children less than 2\u20133 yr of age) attributable to the unmasking of an inborn error of metabolism, a group of diseases that include the organic acidemias, urea cycle defects, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) (Taubman et al., 1987; Greene et al., 1988; Roe, 1988). The \u201cunmasking\u201d may be a response to a specific illness, or to any disorder that limits caloric intake, and results in a disease that in many ways resembles RS. Factors that may distinguish inborn errors from RS include normal ammonia levels at presentation, a very short period between onset of initiating illness and pernicious vomiting, and lack of signs of increased intracranial pressure.",

            "text": "The encephalopathy of Reye\u2019s Syndrome is a noninflammatory, reversible process. Death, if it occurs, is usually owing to a severe brain edema in which the cerebral cortex has swollen to the extent that it becomes necrotic up against the nonyielding cranial vault (Venes et al., 1978). The swelling leads to increased intracranial pressure and altered cerebral perfusion (McWilliam and Stephenson, 1985; Frewen and Kisson, 1987). It is not known whether the edema is cytotoxic or vasogenic. The extensive histopathological studies of (1978) and others (Venes et al., 1978) have shown that there is an increase in the number and size of astrocytes, and that they are often devoid of glycogen granules. Of particular interest is the fact that astrocytic mitochondria are relatively normal in structure. Depending on the severity of the disease, neurons may also be enlarged, and in contrast to the astrocytes, may contain pale, enlarged, and pleomorphic mitochondria. Capillary endothelial cells appear to be normal, with normal-appearing mitochondria, which is consistent with evidence that the blood-brain barrier is intact (Brown and Forman, 1982). Demyelination does not appear to occur, although (1978) have reported the presence of watery blebs within the myelin sheaths,",

There are no outstanding abnormalities in lipid accumulation or metabolism (Brown and Forman, 1982), and the activities of enzymes that are altered in the liver appear to be normal (Robinson et al., 1978). Simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular vein ammonia levels indicate that the toxic metabolite is taken up in large quantities by the brain in RS patients. The excessive load of ammonia appears to be related to increased brain lactic acid production (for review, see\nDeLong and Glick, 1982). (1984) have demonstrated hypercatecholaminemia in patients with RS, and suggested that this might contribute to the encephalopathy of the disease. A recent report also indicated that CSF levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a prominent neuronal cytosolic enzyme that is released upon neuronal destruction, are elevated in RS (Nara et al., 1988).",

However, since Reye\u2019s original publication in 1963, many investigators and clinicians have believed that a toxin is involved in some manner in the initiation of the disease, based on the fact that its progression resembles an acute toxic event. A wide range of exogenous toxins have been shown to produce at least some of the clinical features of RS (Pranzatelli and De Vivo, 1987); however, no single xenobiotic toxin or groups of toxins have been shown unequivocally to be the causative agent(s) (Crocker, 1982,1988). Within the past several years, considerable attention has focused on salicylates as a causative agent, and declines in aspirin use and in the incidence of RS tend to support an association between the two. However, attempts to demonstrate salicylate-dependent potentiation of viral effects in animal models generally have been unsuccessful (see Section 4.5.2.). In the human disease, there is no obvious genetic predisposition, and in cases involving siblings, one might presume that the RS-like disorder is actually an inborn error of metabolism (see Section 1.2.). Many investigators, including ourselves, now believe that exposure of susceptible individuals to environmental chemicals, including salicylates, can result in an abnormal and potentially lethal response to what is normally a relatively benign virus infection (Crocker, 1982).",

One of the primary focuses in RS research has been to determine which, if any, of these metabolites are responsible for the distinct encephalopathy of the disease. The three groups of metabolites that have been deemed the most likely candidates include ammonia, free fatty acids, and short chain organic acids, each of which is known to produce neuropathy in humans when present in excessive amounts (DeLong and Glick, 1982). A broad discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this review, but it should be mentioned that for each of these groups there is substantial evidence against their being the sole encephalopathic factors in RS. Nevertheless, several working hypotheses have evolved from the knowledge that individuals with RS are in a highly exaggerated catabolic state, and these have provided the basis for the development of several of the animal models described in this chapter.",

Just prior to the second dose, they become hyperreactive to a sudden noise, and shortly after they develop florid neurological signs, including hyporeactivity, coma, and seizures. However, there is no evidence of structural damage or cerebral edema, as judged by a normal brain water content. Serum analyses indicate hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and elevated aspartate and alanine transaminase activities. There is no indication in the literature as to whether MO alters serum free fatty acid levels or amino acid profiles. Microvesicular fat droplets are present in the liver and kidney, but not in the brain. There is no evidence of necrosis or inflammation in the liver; however, hepatic mitochondria are swollen, with loss of matrix, cristae, and dense bodies, and liver glycogen is depleted. Of the liver enzyme activities studied (monoamine oxidase, glutamate dehydrogenase, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase), only catalase was reduced significantly. The results of recent in vitro studies indicate that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled by MO, that Stage 4 respiration is increased, whereas the respiratory control ratio is decreased, and that mitochondrial ATP content is reduced (Koga et al., 1987).",

A second stage (Level 2) involves an increase in the rate and depth of respiration; the animals are very hyperactive, and in some cases, have tonic-clonic movements of the extremities. This behavior is more exaggerated at higher doses (Level 3), and further increases result in convulsions and coma within 10 min after the injection (Level 4). Fatal cases proceed to a state of apnea (Level 5). Kang et al. demonstrated that encephalopathy did not develop with administration of saturated fatty acids, and that the most profound neurological responses were produced by arachidonic (C20:4\u03c96) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6\u03c93) acids, two PUFA that are present in high concentrations in the brain. Injection of melittin into the cisterna magna, and infusion of PUFA into the internal carotid artery produced effects similar to those with intercisternally administered PUFA, however, systemic administration of the acids produced only mild hyperventilation.

Examination of the livers indicated that the endotoxin-treated rats had appreciably greater fat deposition than their fasted controls, and that the mitochondria from 6/10 of the LPS animals were pleomorphic, with expanded and disrupted matrices.

Intestinal coronavirus was the pathogen most frequently associated with the acute illness. The mice that died following a rapid deterioration in consciousness had many pathologic findings (e.g., fatty steatosis of the liver, swollen mitochondria, elevated serum ammonia) characteristic of RS. Neuropathological assessment by light microscopy indicated that there was a significant increase in the number of astrocytes in specific brain regions, and that these had swollen, pallorous nuclei reminiscent of Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis. These changes are not seen in RS. Under electron microscopy, the cytoplasm of cortical astrocytes was electron lucent and expanded, particularly in the pericapillary end-feet. There was evidence of lipid droplets and membrane-bound vacuoles, and a reduced number of glycogen particles. Astrocytic mitochondria were normal in structure. By contrast, neuronal mitochondria were swollen and contained rarified matrices and disorganized and fragmented cristae. With the exception of the Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes, these findings closely parallel those seen in the acute phase of human RS.",

By contrast, ferrets that are fed an Arg diet become hyperactive within 2 h, and then progress rapidly to a comatose state.

The encephalopathy and biochemical changes are most pronounced when the animals are given the combined FluB, ASA, and Arg diet treatment. In addition to the abnormalities just described, laboratory investigations indicate increased serum levels of free fatty acids and transaminases, normal bilirubin, increased prothrombin time, decreased liver ornithine and carbamyl transferase activities, and increased liver lipids and CSF levels of ammonia and glutamine. Electron microscopic analysis indicates swollen and pleomorphic liver mitochondria and decreased glycogen (Deshmukh, 1985).

We have now studied chemical potentiation of viral infection using several variations of this basic paradigm. The most recent and most extensively studied is a model in which neonatal mice are exposed dermally to nontoxic amounts of the emulsifier, Toximul MP8, and subsequently infected with sublethal doses of mouse-adapted human influenza B virus (FluB) (Crocker et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1986, 1987). \n",

Pups born on the day in which most births occur are used for the experiment, and this is considered Day 0 of the study. On Day 1, the age-matched pups are counted, pooled, and randomly distributed among the nursing mothers. Animals are housed in sets of 2 mothers with 2 litters (7\u20138 pups/litter) per cage. The neonates are divided into two groups, one of which is painted abdominally with Eagle\u2019s Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), and the other group are painted with a 1% solution (8.9 mg/100 mL MEM) of the industrial surfactant, Toximul MP8 (Tox) (Charles Tennant & Company, Toronto, Canada; Lot 9-30162). For the first 5 d, the mice receive 8.6 + 2.6 mg Tox/d; this dosage is increased to 25.8 + 9.0 mg/d for the last 6 d. In a limited number of our studies, Tox was administered in a single ip injection (Crocker et al., 1986).\n\n",

After 48 h, the mice are killed and lungs are removed, weighed, and homogenized with a tissue grinder in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS)(10% w/v) containing 2% (w/v) gelatin. After two freeze-thaw cycles, the homogenate is centrifuged at 800g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove debris. The supernatant is diluted in HBSS, and 0.1 mL aliquots are inoculated into the allantoic cavities of 8-day-old fertilized hen eggs. After 48 h at 37\u00b0C, the allantoic fluid is collected, centrifuged (800g, 10 min), and stored in 0.5 mL aliquots at -80\u00b0C (virus stock).

The mortality rates vary from one experiment to another; however, mice given the combined Tox plus virus treatment consistently have a higher mortality rate than those given virus alone (Crocker et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1986). The two aspects of this detergent + FluB model that best reflect the human disease are the selective ultrastructural damage to hepatic mitochondria (Crocker et al., 1986), and the increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) (Crocker et al., 1991). Neither effect is seen in animals exposed to detergent alone; virus infection alone does not affect the mitochondria, although it does produce moderate increases in ICP. The serum changes that are consistent with RS include hyperammonemia (also seen with detergent alone) and a decreased total lipid content (hypopanlipidemia). The livers of the combined-treatment mice show no evidence of inflammation or necrosis, but have significantly reduced levels of ornithine transcarbamylase activity. The features that distinguish this model from the human disease are an apparent lack of increase in serum free fatty acids and an absence of hepatic fat. There are at least two possible explanations for these discrepancies, one of which is that they occur during the earlier periods of the experiment at times when no analyses were done, or (and perhaps more likely) the synergism between the detergent and virus with respect to fat abnormalities is a species-specific phenomenon. Support for the latter of these possibilities comes from observations that there is frequently hepatic fat accumulation when the infecting virus is the native mouse pathogen, encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. In the EMC model, which has been studied by our group (Crocker et a1.,1974, 1976) and by others (Hug et al., 1981), the mice are exposed to either Toximul (our studies) or to Atlox 3409 F (ICI America Inc., Wilmington, DE) (Hug et al., 1981), and subsequently inoculated ip with the virus in amounts that are titered to produce a 30\u201350% mortality rate. Deaths generally occur between 2\u20134 d following inoculation. In addition to developing fatty liver, the mice treated with EMC and detergent have several other hepatic changes consistent with RS (e.g., mitochondrial structural abnormalities and enzymatic changes).",

We have obtained preliminary data confirming the presence of 1,2-dibromoethane (a derivatized byproduct of Toximul) in mouse and human livers, and in human brain samples (Crocker et al., 1985) but we have not done a large number of analyses. An important question is whether death results from the lung infection or whether an encephalopathy is involved. The lungs of the mice are infected, and virus can be recovered from them; however, data concerning CNS involvement have been difficult to obtain from such a small animal. In recent studies in which we measured ICP using a scaled-down method described for cats, we found that the mice treated with detergent plus FluB had significantly elevated values for ICP (Crocker et al., 1991). Our present focus is to determine whether there is a relationship between detergent exposure, lipid catabolism, and elevated ICP.",

Finally, in our attempts to mimic the disease in animals, we must appreciate that this may be a species-specific disease, one or more of its components may be species-specific, and/or individual events within the disease process may differ from one species to another.
