Globally, the prevalence of anxiety disorders was almost double in females (5.2 %) as compared to males (2.8 %) estimated using 272.2 million people in 2010 (32) . One explanation of why women tend to be more prone to stress is because they ruminate about life stressors, which can increase their anxiety, while men engage more in active, problem-focused coping (33) . In India, it is common for females to serve the family, and especially during the lockdown, females are managing household chores and office work at home. They have to keep up with the demands of all the family members constantly, such as food and cleaning, as well as home-schooling children, who are also not able to get their regular education due to the lockdown. Thus, rendering females physically and mentally exhausted, which may contribute to higher anxiety levels. Other reasons may be that women are more likely to experience physical and mental abuse than men (33) , and abuses of any kind are found to be linked to the development of anxiety disorders (33) .",

Lower levels of self-reported health status may give rise to sleep disturbances, fatigue, pain that may trigger worry and anxiety. The inverse association between anxiety and health status also raises the possibility that anxiety may cause poorer health status. We postulate that the presence of anxiety may be associated with lower compliance with medical treatments, thus undermining health (42) . Also, anxiety among our sample may be because patients are facing problems in accessing health services amid lockdown (44).",

The sleep pattern of people altered due to self-isolation and routine changes. A change in the amount of time spent outside could most likely influence the routine at home, for instance, time of awakening and sleeping and time of a meal. Many people may feel more fatigue related to the mental workload associated with covid-19, and this fatigue can also be caused by psychological states, such as stress and anxiety (45). The pandemic has made people confused and uncertain and given some a sense of trepidation. All these feelings can lead to poor sleep quality, which in turn can make people more tired and anxious (42) .",
