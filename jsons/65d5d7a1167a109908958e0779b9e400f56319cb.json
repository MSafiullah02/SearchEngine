For example, recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of hospital admissions and deaths among Hispanic/Latinx and African American communities 2, 3 . In New York City, Hispanic/Latinx and African American patients represent 34% and 28% of fatalities despite only representing 29% and 22% of the population, respectively 4 .

These social determinants include poverty, wealth, educational quality, neighborhood conditions, childhood experience, social support, access, etc. Social determinants linked to NCD's are thought to adversely impact disease outcomes via chronic exposures throughout the life course 6, 7 . Unfortunately, the relatively short duration of acute infectious disease has limited investigations into the impact of social determinants, as most of this research has been conducted in chronic infections including HIV and TB 8 . However, more recent research on influenza suggested individual-level factors, neighborhood level factors, access to care, and social policies were associated with disparities in both respiratory infections and vaccine uptake [9] [10] [11] .

Other studies suggest that neighborhoods defined as disadvantaged were associated with higher influenzarelated deaths, hospitalizations, and poorer vaccination coverage [9] [10] [11] 19 . Similarly, for COVID-19 the interaction of social determinants at multiple levels may lead to a \"perfect storm\" that disproportionately affects underserved populations by negatively impacting both rates of infection and outcomes.",

We hypothesize that the lower income and minority populations that demonstrate a similar increase over time may also be experiencing this \"frontline\" spike due to barriers to social distancing.\" Social policies at the local, county, state, and national level, including universal face masking, self and family case isolation, social distancing, school cancellation, and voluntary or mandated shelter in place, may underlie the connection between social determinants and COVID-19 disparities 21 . For example, while social distancing has been demonstrated to be a strong and effective preventive measure against COVID-19 transmission rates 22, 23 , our data suggest that those living in communities where work at home is infrequent had higher COVID-19 case growth. Adherence to social policies is likely difficult for populations that do not have and cannot afford remote work options. For example, approximately 75% of New York frontline and essential workers, including healthcare, grocery & convenience stores, public transit, cleaning services, and delivery operations, are people of color 24 . We suggest that social policies incorporate a framework around social determinants that would promote strategies to achieve equity for all communities.",
