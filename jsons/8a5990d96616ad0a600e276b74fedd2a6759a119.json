            "text": "There is increasing concern that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might be at risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis co-infection. 1 In a cohort of 221 patients with COVID-19 in China, fungal infections were diagnosed in seven individuals, all of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 2 However, causative fungal pathogens were not identified. 2 Given that in China, galactomannan testing is rarely available, 3 the real burden of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission is probably underestimated. Indeed, nine patients with COVID-19 and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were recently described in France (33% of 27 admitted to the ICU with COVID-19), 4 and five in Germany (26% of 19 admitted); 5 rates similar to those observed in association with influenza. 6 Although serum galactomannan is a sensitive diagnostic marker in patients with neutropenia in intensive care, galactomannan sensitivity was only 25% in patients who did not have neutropenia, but had proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. 7 Although serum galactomannan was positive in 65% of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, 6 only three (21%) of 14 patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis were serum galactomannan positive. 4, 5 Reasons for the lower sensitivity in patients with COVID-19 versus those with influenza are unknown, although treatment with chloroquine might have a negative effect on serum galactomannan performance, because the drug exhibits in-vitro activity against Aspergillus fumigatus. 8 Exposure to antifungals is a well known factor that decreases the sensitivity of serum galactomannan testing.",

Most patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis did not have European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/ MSGERC) host factors, because only two (15%) of 13 had haematological malignancy as underlying disease. 3 Absence of host factors was also apparent in influenza-associated disease, in which 57% of patients could not be classified according to the EORTC/MSGERC consensus definition or the AspICU algorithm for patients in ICUs. A retrospective multicentre cohort study showed that influenza infection was an independent risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. 6 In addition to local erosion of the epithelial barrier of the respiratory tract, influenza virus can exhibit a direct immunomodulatory effect through suppression of the NADPH oxidase complex. 9 Suppression of the NADPH oxidase complex might cause a temporary disease status resembling chronic granulomatous disease, which itself is associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis development. 9 Severe COVID-19 is associated with immune dysregulation, affecting both T-helper cell 2 (Th2) and Th1 responses, 10 although this has not been extensively studied and a direct immuno modulatory effect on the known antifungal host defence has not been demonstrated. During the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, only four cases of proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were reported among 8422 probable SARS cases. 3 Because all four invasive pulmonary aspergillosis cases were associated with concomitant corticosteroid therapy, coronavirus infection itself might not increase the risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but other risk factors might have.",

Furthermore, galactomannan testing is not validated for upper respiratory tract specimens. Bronchoscopy is recommended in COVID-19 only when the intervention is considered lifesaving, which includes secondary infectious causes. 11 Radiological and clinical signs of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients are mostly unspecific and bronchoscopy is thus indicated in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of secondary infection, including fungal diagnostic work-up. Even if evidence for Aspergillus spp is recovered, uncertainty remains about whether patients truly develop invasive disease and require antifungal therapy. Indeed, eight of the nine patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis from France were not treated with antifungal drugs, and the three deaths were considered not to be related to aspergillosis, but clinically attributed to bacterial septic shock. 3 Autopsies were not performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis.",

Only histopathology can prove invasive pulmonary aspergillosis through autopsy of deceased patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. If autopsy is precluded because of the risk of aerosol formation, post-mortem lung biopsy might be considered as an alternative to obtaining tissue. Until histopathological evidence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is obtained, we believe that patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill with evidence for Aspergillus spp in bronchoalveolar lavage or serum should receive antifungal therapy according to national and international guidelines.
