Based on the fact that a complex system consists of many mutually interacting components, the interaction among components and how they intertwine can be captured by a graph, where nodes correspond to individual components and edges to their interactions. Such a network can be thought of as a backbone of the complex system along which signals, information, and contagious entities propagate. In real-world networks, however, undesirable signals can also spread through networks. For example, malicious rumors can spread among individuals, computer worms deluge the internet, and epidemic diseases can infect vulnerable people through contact. Hence, developing effective strategies for preventing the spreading of harmful signals through a network is a research challenge of both theoretical and practical importance.",

Therefore, pursuing an exact solution to influence minimization for large-scale networks suffers from combinatorial explosion. Alternatively, a number of efficient approaches are proposed to approximately solve the problem [3\u201310]. These solutions can be classified into two categories: (i) optimization-based methods; for example, by using the greedy heuristic climbing algorithm, the result of Kempe et al. [9] shows that it can approximate the optimum to within a factor of 1\u22121/e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm); and (ii) structure-based approaches, typically inspired by the relatedness between the topology and functionality of networks, such as those topology based heuristic methods including [4,5]. Compared with the optimization-based algorithms, heuristics approaches are computationally much more efficient and thus more practical in a diversity of networked systems. Therefore, it is of particular interest to devise efficient methods by leveraging the information of the structures of complex networks.",

The property of scale-free degree distribution reflects the allocation of one kind of social capital, from the viewpoint of social network analysis, i.e., a few hub nodes in such networks have a disproportionally large number of interaction partners while the majority of nodes are connected only to just a handful of relations. In other words, to some extent the degree of a node represents the importance of that node in the whole network. Identifying important nodes [17] is of great significance for infection control. In previous works [18\u201320], heuristic methods based on degrees have been proved to be more efficient than random strategies in selecting candidate nodes to vaccinate. However, node degree only captures network property at low orders, while control information spreading paths of networks obviously requires higher-order information on networks. This is why the degree-based methods are not always optimal.",

Considering that information often travels across the shortest paths of a network, it is clear that the more paths pass through a node, the more important that node should be. In this sense, betweenness centrality [21] is an appropriate measure for quantifying the importance of a node. While betweenness has wide applications in many networks, it fails to show superiority compared to degree-based methods [3]. The reason lies in the assumptions that information transfers follow shortest paths, while spreading processes expand more randomly in real-world situations. Further, though betweenness centrality considers the indirect influence of high-order neighbors of the nodes, the infection occurring in the ego networks of the infected has no immediate relation to distant nodes. Ego betweenness [22,23] defines node importance at the local level, but as it is highly correlated with global betweenness centrality, the immunization effects resulting from the two betweenness-based strategies are nearly the same.",

Usually it is insufficient to apply only an individual importance indicator to characterize the role of a node in spreading processes. A reasonable solution is to apply multiple indicators to evaluate the importance of a node and identify its role [24]. However, determining the weightings of respective metrics in the composite measure is an open problem. Besides, some metrics such as betweenness centrality are computationally expensive for large-scale networks. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we design a simple metric, which we call structural hole count (SHC), to capture the roles of a node from multiple facets. This metric is then applied to contain spreading processes modeled in a number of real-world networks. Remarkable improvements on the efficiency of the containing strategy are found through numerical simulations. To further understand properties of this indicator, we also inspect its relationship to existing network metrics. Our findings indicate that the structural hole count achieves a combined effect of the degree correlation and clustering coefficients simultaneously in containing spreading processes.",

            "text": "We begin by introducing a metric for quantifying the relative importance of a node in the spreading process of a network, based on the so-called structural holes. The theory of structural holes indicates that some individuals in a network bridge people or clusters of people that are otherwise disconnected. They act as structural hole spanners to fill the holes among the people or group without direct connections. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, there are four structural holes marked by dashed blue arrows associated with the ego node. For each structural hole, the nodes in it will never have the chance to communicate with each other upon the removal of the ego node. Obviously, the ego node plays an important role in the information propagation and the higher the number of structural holes associated with it, the more important the role is. Hereby we leverage the property of structural holes to define an intuitive measure called structural hole count SHC(i) to quantify the node importance, as\n(1)SHC(i)=12\u2211k,j\u2208Ni(1\u2212Akj),where Ak,j denotes the connectivity between a pair of nodes k and j (Ak,j=1 if there is an edge linking node k and node j and Ak,j=0 otherwise). Moreover, Ni represents the set of neighbors of node i. The SHC(i) counts how many structural holes exist in the neighborhood set of node i. In early studies of social network research, Burt used the same index in the studies of ego networks [25], which is called brokage in the context of sociology. However, less attention has been drawn in applying this measurement in network analysis. In this work, we extend the idea to general networks and reveal its important role in spread control.",

As can be seen, the structural hole count is upper bounded by the squared degrees. This explains the positive correlation between the two quantities, as is demonstrated in Fig. 3, since only nodes with high degrees are likely to have a large structural hole count. However, in the meantime, nodes do exist with high degrees but low structural hole counts: Each of such nodes will be centered by densely interconnected neighbors, leading to a large GNi that diminishes the structural hole count. Therefore, depending on the actual graph connectivity, the two quantities can demonstrate a significant difference as well.",

Then, in the next steps, all currently infected nodes continue to spread the information or disease to their immediate susceptible neighbors until the susceptible become the infected. Eventually, all the nodes are infected if there is no intervention.

In other words, it equivalently takes into account multiple indicators in containing the spreading processes. We believe this is attributed to the interesting relation between the structural hole counts and various network characteristics. In highly transitive networks, the neighbors of a node are heavily interconnected and form a dense local cluster with their ego, while the nodes that span plenty of structural holes are in the critical paths between different clusters. Thus, intuitively, those bridging nodes should be blocked in suppressing diffusion processes, which coincides with the result demonstrated in [45]. In addition to transitivity, high assortativity of a network implies that highly connected nodes are prone to connecting other highly connected nodes, i.e., hub nodes have hub neighbors. In the targeted containing policy, the degree-based method takes into account the fragility of the hubs in scale-free networks [20]. However, due to the high transitivity and degree-degree correlation, the targeted nodes with high degrees are likely to be densely connected and thus fail to maximize their influence on spreading processes. In contrast, the structural hole count takes into account not only high connections but the type of the connections between the target nodes and the rest nodes. That is, those hubs with weak ties are more important in preventing the infections. Consequently, blocking such nodes will significantly improve the performance of the containing strategy.",

In fact, both methods are very efficient in containing the spreading process with a small portion of immunized nodes in disassortative networks. The reason is that disassortative networks often have a scale-free degree distribution. Neighbors of high-degree nodes usually only have a small number of connections and these neighbors are not interconnected directly by virtue of the disassortativity property. In other words, the structural hole counts and the degree are close for those truly important nodes in containing the spreading process.
