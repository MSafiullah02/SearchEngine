CoVs infect humans and other mammals and birds, causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal disease (Woo et al., 2012).

From January to May 2017, an outbreak of SADS-CoV led to the deaths of almost 25,000 piglets in Southern China and resulted in significant economic losses (Fu et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b).",

The first two-thirds of the genome code for proteins involved in replication and transcription of viral RNA. The other third codes structural proteins that build up the coronavirion. All CoVs contain a common set of structural proteins: N, spike, membrane and envelope (Lai, 1990). In infected cells, N protein is the most abundant of the viral proteins (He et al., 2004). N protein is involved in structure and RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004; Enjuanes et al., 2006). In the virion, nucleoprotein molecules associate with viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (Nelson et al., 2000). CoVs N protein contains both nuclear localization and export signals (Rowland et al., 2005; Timani et al., 2005; You et al., 2005) suggesting shuttling of the protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in virus-infected cells. Nucleolar localization of other coronavirus nucleoproteins is reported in transfected cells (Chang et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2014; You et al., 2005). However, inconsistent data were obtained about the presence of N protein in the nucleus of virus-infected cells with some studies seeing no evidence of nuclear localization (Laude and Masters, 1995).",

Cells were harvested at 48 h post transfection. Expression of GFP-fused recombinant proteins was confirmed by western blot using mouse mAb against GFP (Proteintech, China). For the second round, two polypeptides spanning amino acids 250\u2013376 (amino acids 250\u2013310 and 311\u2013376) were designed and expressed as GFP fusion proteins.

Recombinant proteins were expressed in HEK293 T cells and confirmed by western blot as described above. For the last round, for peptides N6\u2013N22, pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized.

Isotype determination showed that the N-specific mAb 3E9 was subclass lgG1/\u03ba-type. The specificity of mAb 3E9 was tested using western blot and cell lysates infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), or SADS-CoV. Hybridoma 3E9 mAb proved to be strictly SADS-CoV specific (Fig. 3\nA). To further determine mAb specificity, cell transfected with pCMV-Myc-N plasmid were analyzed by western blot using mAb 3E9 as the primary antibody. MAb 3E9 specifically reacted with eukaryotically expressed N protein but not with samples from empty plasmid pCMV-Myc transfections (Fig. 3B). in vitro neutralization tests showed that mAb 3E9 was not a neutralizing antibody (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation assays determined if SADS-CoV N protein could be precipitated from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells using mAb 3E9. The mAb precipitated SADS-CoV N protein from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells but not from mock-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3C). We also noticed that the extent of SADS-CoV N cleavage varied with experiments and was determined primarily by the extent of viral infection or viral propagation conditions (e.g., trypsin addition) (Fig. 3C). SADS-CoV N expressed from an expression plasmid (pCMV-Myc-N) yielded only one major band at the expected size of full-length SADS-N (Fig. 3B). The additional smaller bands could be cleavage products based on several coronavirus N proteins identified by immunoblotting (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2017; Laude and Masters, 1995).",

Coronavirus N proteins are important structural proteins in virus assembly and are main targets for development of immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic techniques. Although diagnostic methods using SADS-CoV nucleotides have been developed using PCR and DNA sequencing of species-specific N genes (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b), no differential diagnostic methods are reported for virus protein detection. To obtain diagnostic mAbs for clinical applications, in this study, we generated mAb 3E9 against a species-specific antigenic N protein of SADS-CoV. We found that the mAb reacted specifically against native SADS-CoV N protein (Figs. 3A and 4) and recombinant N protein (Fig. 3B). Mapping epitopes of viral proteins and defining the degree of conservation of identified epitopes may facilitate our understanding of antigenic structures and virus-antibody interactions. This information is useful for clinical applications. Although CoV N proteins are major structural proteins, epitopes on SADS-CoV N protein have not been reported. To study specificity in more detail and finely map the epitope bound by mAb 3E9, a series of truncated N proteins was generated for peptide scanning. An epitope recognized by mAb 3E9 corresponding to aa 343\u2013351 (DAPVFTPAP) in the SADS-CoV N protein was identified (Fig. 5).",

The NTD and CTD structures have been investigated (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006). The CTDs of CoV N proteins mediate self-association in oligomer formation, making them a good target for mutagenesis research on disrupting CoV N protein self-association and virion assembly (Chang et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2005). In our study, the linear epitope of mAb 3E9 was located in the CTD of the SADS-CoV N protein. The mAb could be used to elucidate the function of this domain.",

Despite the structural and functional similarities of the N protein to other alphacoronavirus, the epitope did not share any obvious sequence homology and had low identity (Fig. 6b). The highly conserved nature of these epitopes in N would be an advantage in developing technologies for epitope-based diagnoses. MAb 3E9 against SADS-CoV N protein could be used in various assays. For example, mAb 3E9 showed that SADS-CoV N protein localizes to the cytoplasm and also to the nucleolus in infected cells and cells expressing only N protein alone (Fig. 4). During infection, a number of viral proteins interact with the nucleolus (Shi et al., 2017). The interaction of viral proteins with nucleolar antigens may explain why viral proteins have been observed in the nucleolus and the viral exploitation of nucleolar function that leads to alterations in host cell transcription and translation and disruption of the host cell cycle to facilitate viral replication. MAb 3E9 immunoprecipitated N protein from lysates of SADS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3C). The capacity of mAb 3E9 to immunoprecipitate N protein will promote further studies on interactions of N protein with viral and cellular proteins.",
