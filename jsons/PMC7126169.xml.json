For example, sensors based on field-effect transistor (FET) configurations with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1], [2], [3], graphene [4], [5], [6], [7], and nanowires (NWs) [8], [9], [10] have been widely used for sensing the electric charge of biomolecules (e.g., glucose, proteins and DNA) after their adsorption on the FET surface. The most reported biological interactions with nanomaterial-based FET sensors are enzymatic glucose detection, antibody-antigen binding (immunoreaction) and DNA hybridization [1], [11], [12].",

For example, the role played by CNT density in FET-biosensor performance has been reported [11], [13], [14], [15], demonstrating that it is critical in achieving high uniformity and analytical performance. Following that perspective, the influence of NW dimensions and doping levels for the sensitivity of NW-FET devices has also been demonstrated by theoretical and experimental studies [10], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) are figures of merit that are closely associated with the transduction mechanism and morphological characteristics of sensors [21], being important tools for assessing analytical reliability, capacity, and variability in techniques and devices [22].",

The sensing mechanism of chemical and biological systems with NWs is based on modulating the NW-surface potential, which is due to the change of charge density of the target analytes after their binding to the receptor groups linked to the NW surface. Thus, the depletion or the accumulation of carriers in the NW structure causes the high sensitivity of the devices [44]. For FET devices with SWCNTs, three possible mechanisms have been proposed and extensively reviewed by Heller et al. [45]. When analyte molecules interact with CNTs, the electronic properties of devices are altered causing changes in the current signal due to:\u2022charge transfer between molecules and NTs;\u2022scattering potential for mobile charges; or,\u2022charge scattering caused by local deformation.\n",

However, irregularities in electrical, chemical and mechanical properties of sensors with CNTs come from the different processes of CNT synthesis. More specifically, the device-to-device variation after the interaction of biomolecules can be due to [14], [47]:(1)the random nature of NT networks in terms of their chirality (depending of the way of rolling up the sheet of graphene), which consequently affects the CNT diameter;(2)variations in NT density;(3)bundling of SWCNT networks; and,(4)different ratios of metallic and semiconducting NTs, depending of their chiral angles and diameters.\n",

The enhanced sensitivity associated with a low density of SWCNTs is partly explained by the elimination of direct metallic NT pathways, enhancing the semiconductor behavior of NTs and providing a strong gate dependence, lower capacitance, and high ON/OFF ratios, while the high density of SWCNTs reflects their quasi-metallic behavior [14].",

The applicability of the calibration method developed to real-time biosensing was an advantage, since the absolute response in current (nA units), which led to the large device-to-device variation, was modified for a response in voltage (mV units, calibrated response), reducing such variation. In this way, the calibrated response depends on only the change in the effective gate voltage induced by the binding of streptavidin. Moreover, the calibrated responses from different devices lower the estimated coefficient of variation (CV), compared to the CV obtained from absolute response (Table 4).",

            "text": "Moreover, such requirements based on monolayer coverage, adsorption-site equivalence and independence are not met in biosorption because biological molecules have various types of binding site, which contribute to the biosorption process. However, the formation of a monolayer is possible only under low-pressure conditions, and the theoretical homogeneity of binding events requested is not always verified in real surfaces, so limiting application of the model. Then, when the Langmuir isotherm model is applied to the calibration of nanomaterial-based sensors, special care must be taken about the effectiveness of such an application and about the experimental conditions of the sensor development.",

The device-to-device variability verified in various nanomaterial-based sensors is the main cause for hindering their use in practical applications. In this field, the control of the nanomaterial characteristics (e.g., density, chirality and diameter of CNTs, and number, diameter and doping level of NWs) is of paramount importance, since they are critical to the enhancement of various figures of merit (e.g., LOD and sensitivity towards the analyte of interest).",
