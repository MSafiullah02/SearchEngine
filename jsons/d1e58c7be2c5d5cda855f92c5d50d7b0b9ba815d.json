It was estimated that in 2002, there were approximately 1.7 million healthcareassociated infections, which resulted in approximately 99,000 deaths [41] . A more recent meta-analysis of the costs and financial impact of HAI on the US healthcare system reported that the total annual costs for the five major infections (central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), surgical site infections (SSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)) were $9.8 billion (95 % confidence interval (CI) $8.3 to $11.5 billion) [106] . There has been an unprecedented movement for healthcare facilities to improve patient safety and certainly prevention of HAI represents a major portion of that effort. The process by which a patient acquires an infection while hospitalized is complex. This has been elegantly illustrated and described by Dr. Weinstein ( Fig. 4.1) , highlighting the role of the patient's endogenous flora, exposure to exogenous flora, as well as the influence of devices and pressure from antibiotic use [101] . Recent development and implementation of strategies to prevent HAI have included such efforts as antimicrobial stewardship, interrupting transmission of epidemiologically important organisms, and infection specific prevention bundles; however, there is renewed interest in defining the role of environmental contamination in transmission of nosocomial pathogens and development of HAI. [101] ). The complexity and dynamic nature of the microbial pressure being introduced into the built clinical environment is dependent on stochastic nature inherent to healthcare The purpose of this chapter is to review the role of the environment of care as it pertains to microbial contamination and risk of HAI to patients as well as describe the novel use and efficacy of antimicrobial copper surfaces in mitigating this risk. We will discuss problematic pathogens in healthcare, their ability to contaminate and persist in the environment, their ability to contaminate the healthcare provider, and ultimately their ability to directly or indirectly result in colonization and infection in the patient. We will briefly review the traditional measures utilized to reduce the microbial burden associated with the healthcare environment but focus our discussion on the use of continuously active antimicrobial solid copper for this purpose. Given that, we describe the proposed mechanism of action for copper's antimicrobial property, its activity against pathogens commonly found in healthcare, as well as the clinical efficacy of placing solid copper surfaces into the patient care environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 307, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 772, "end": 777, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1273, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1667, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1110, "text": "Fig. 4.1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The majority of healthcare associated infections are thought to occur via transmission from the patient's own endogenous flora. However, there is increasing evidence that there exists significant transmission of microbes from healthcare personnel and the hospital environment to vulnerable patients. A study published in 1991 estimated that the causative source of an HAI in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was the patients' endogenous flora 40-60 % of the time and antibiotic driven changes in flora 20-25 % of the time. Cross-infection via the hands of personnel accounted for 20-40 % of cases and other sources, including contamination from the environment, accounted for the remaining 20 % [101] . It has been established that the inanimate hospital environment can become contaminated with nosocomial pathogens after exposure to colonized patients [36] . This environment includes surfaces within the hospital room (bedrails, bedside tables, etc.) and medical equipment. A review of the available literature in 2002 concluded that personal and environmental hygiene reduced the spread of infections [1] . More recent literature has provided additional evidence that contaminated hospital surfaces are a source of transmission of nosocomial pathogens [57] . Otter and colleagues delineated the continuous, omni-directional and complex nature of how microbes can easily move between infected or colonized patients, healthcare workers, and objects resident in the built environment (Chap. 3 and ref [57] ) ( Fig. 4.2 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 692, "end": 697, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1503, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1508, "end": 1516, "text": "Fig. 4.2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Role of the Environment in Healthcare Infection"}, {"text": "Microbes have an innate ability to contaminate and potentially establish residence on any surface. Surfaces with frequent hand contact and in close proximity to the patient are often colonized with nosocomial pathogens, and most of these pathogens can remain viable on these inanimate surfaces for weeks to months (Chap. 2 and ref [42] ). Further, the distribution and dispersal of the microbes from healthcare workers, visitors and patients can contribute to the resident microbial flora of the built environment. Humans shed a minimum of ten million of their 100 million skin cells per day. Routine activities such as walking can result in the loss of approximately 10 4 skin particles per minute with a complete layer of skin cells being lost and replaced from healthy individuals on average approximately every 4 days [51] . The displaced skin cells are covered with the endogenous flora of the individual. Not all individuals shed skin equally. In one study of microbial dispersal by skin in a hospital ward, Noble defined a 'Staph aureus disperser' as a patient who contributed greater than six S. aureus per cubic meter of air [52] . Given that the mean concentration of bacteria within the ward was the equivalent of 800 viable bacteria per cubic meter, the concentration of S. aureus observed was thought to represent 1 % of the total flora [52] . Over the years the number has been revised to suggest that an individual is a 'Staph aureus disperser' when they are able to disseminate more than four viable particles per microbe per cubic meter of air [9] . Causality, or the linkage of an environmental isolate to that organism responsible for disease in individuals has been demonstrated as early as 1945 when deForest and Kerr reported cases of eczema which occurred amongst nurses that were caused by streptococci that were shed [26] . With the advent of molecular techniques, such as Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing, the ability to demonstrate casualty has now become much more straightforward but is still nevertheless time intensive and cost prohibitive.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 822, "end": 826, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1138, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1354, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1564, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1846, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbes in the Built Environment"}, {"text": "Once established within the built environment the microbe must then be able to resist the perturbations introduced as a consequence of cleaning and other infection control measures.

First, the pathogen must be able to survive on the objects and surfaces within the environment for a sufficiently long period of time while retaining its ability to be virulent or its ability to colonize a susceptible host after its subsequent liberation from the surface and resulting transmission/establishment. Second, contamination of the environment by a particular pathogen must be sufficiently frequent to account for its loss from the object or surfaces as a consequence of routine cleaning, desiccation, or starvation. Third, the agent must be present at a concentration sufficient to establish itself upon encountering the new host or location. Certain nosocomial pathogens, such as Norovirus, have incredibly small infectious doses with a median dose of 18 viruses [86] while the environmental dose of the causative agent of the majority of CAUTI, Escherichia coli, is not as evident. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) has classified that in the absence of symptoms a concentration of 10 5 colony forming units (CFU) per ml coupled where 1 bacterial species is present in the urine of a catheterized patient that the individual has an asymptomatic catheter associated bacteriuria (CA-ASB) [35] . A CAUTI is defined as the \"presence of symptoms or signs compatible with urinary tract infections (UTI) with no other identified source of infection along with 10 3 CFU/mL of 1 bacterial species\" from a catheterized or previously catheterized (48 h) urine sample [35] . However the guidelines are silent as to the origin and/or concentration of the microbe(s) required to establish the CA-ASB or CAUTI. The concept of infectious dose from the environment as it pertains to nosocomial infection has not been rigorously studied for the majority of the HAI. Further study is warranted. Hospitals have put into place measures in an attempt to decrease the contamination or likelihood of colonization of healthcare workers with infectious pathogens. Focus has been placed on increased hand hygiene, contact precautions, and enhanced environmental cleaning. In 2006 Pittet and colleagues presented an evidence-based model arguing for improved hand hygiene practices during patient care as being the most important method for preventing HAI and spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens [61] . In their model, five steps are required for the transmission of pathogens within the clinical care setting. Collectively, the model considers the microbes and their transmission from objects, healthcare workers, and patients to the next individual or object. The first step requires that the microbe be present or resident on the patients'/healthcare workers' skin or immediate environment. The concentration of the nosocomial pathogen can vary from as few as 1 to over 10 6 CFU per cm 2 . Subsequently, the microbe must be transferred to the healthcare worker. Simple acts such as lifting a patient, obtaining a blood pressure, pulse, or assessing a temperature can easily result in the transfer of between 100 and 1,000 CFU of a common Gramnegative pathogen Klebsiella spp. [19] . In fact these authors learned that 17 % of the staff of an intensive care unit were found to have Klebsiella contaminating their hands when screened and that the serotypes were related to those isolated from infected or colonized patients within the ICU on the same day [19] . Further advancing the importance of hand hygiene was a study that found healthcare workers were as likely to contaminate their hands or gloves from commonly-touched environmental surfaces as from direct contact with colonized patients [85] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1440, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1710, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2529, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3308, "end": 3312, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3585, "end": 3589, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3827, "end": 3831, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission of Pathogens to Patients and Healthcare Workers"}, {"text": "The third aspect of the model is dependent upon the biology of the microbe. Some microbes can survive for longer periods of time on hands than others. Epidemic and non-epidemic strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were found to have significantly different survival times [30] supporting the argument that bacterial properties other than the survival of a typed strain under defined conditions may contribute to the ability of a microbe to be easily transmitted and retained within healthcare setting. In other studies workers found that bacterial colonization of the hands of healthcare workers progressively increased with time [60, 62] . In these two studies they found that the concentration of commensal and pathogenic flora increased as a consequence of patient care.

The fourth and fifth aspects of the model advanced by Pittet and colleagues addresses the issue of defective and/or absent hand cleansing and how it can lead to the cross transmission of the microbes [61] . Here they have raised the issue of the need to microbiologically validate proper hand cleansing in order to control the spread of microbes regardless of their source. In citing a study by Sala and colleagues, they describe how an outbreak of Norovirus was traced to an infected food handler within a hospital cafeteria. Here the implicated foodstuffs consumed during the outbreak were handmade by the infected worker [69] . Independently, it has been shown that Norovirus contaminated fingers can sequentially transfer this virus to up to seven surfaces [7] . Sequential transfer is not only confined to human to surface transfer. In the same study, the virus was found to move from contaminated cleaning cloths to clean hands and surfaces [7] . Recently, Snitkin and colleagues used whole genome sequencing to track an outbreak of Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumonia that occurred at the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center where they learned that despite early implementation of infection control procedures, including aggressive hand hygiene controls, the microbe persisted in the environment [83] . Consequently, the built environment can serve as a reservoir from which clean hands can serve as a source of HAI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 452, "end": 456, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 876, "end": 880, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1016, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1202, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1580, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission of Pathogens to Patients and Healthcare Workers"}, {"text": "When a patient is known to be colonized or infected with a transmittable pathogen, dedicated equipment (i.e. stethoscopes) should be used when possible along with other personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves and masks.

In addition to medical equipment and healthy or intact skin, there have been reports of the transfer of bacteria to the gloves and gowns of healthcare workers after patient contact [6, 18, 33, 49] . Specifically, Morgan and colleagues reported that the transfer of multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR) to the gowns and gloves of healthcare workers occurred after routine contact, and that this was found to increase as environmental contamination increased [49] .

Most striking however, were the conclusions that resulted from the modeling of their data. Here a positive environmental culture was found to be the strongest risk factor associated with the contamination of the clothing of the healthcare worker by MDR bacteria (Odds ratio (OR) 4.2; 95 % CI 2.7-6.5) [49] . Other independent variables, such as presence in the patient's room for greater than 5 min (OR 2.0; p \u00bc 0.014), performing a physical examination (OR 1.7; p \u00bc 0.019) or contact with a ventilator (OR 1.8; p \u00bc 0.014) were similarly significant in raising the likelihood or risk of transfer of MDR bacteria but at rates lower than the rate observed for a positive environmental culture [49] . Intuition would suggest transfer was greater when interacting with a patient. However, the higher risk associated with a positive environmental culture serves to reinforce the importance that the microbial burden of the built clinical environment represents to the set of circumstances required for colonization and infection of patients while hospitalized. [46] . In another study where the environments of patients colonized or infected with VRE were evaluated upwards of 37 % of the environmental samples collected were found to harbor VRE [31] . The samples included patient gowns, medical equipment used for care, as well as environmental surfaces [31] . Controlling the spread of VRE to subsequent room occupants is challenging in that this microbe can be resistant to the disinfectants used for routine and terminal cleaning; even the use of bleach-based products have been reported to fail in their ability to eradicate the microbe from surfaces [22, 24] (See also Chap. 9). Independent of cleaning, the issue of transference of pathogens from the environment to subsequent occupants can be inferred from studies demonstrating the long-term survival of the microbes on surfaces within the built environment. MRSA and other nosocomial pathogens, including VRE and C. difficile can survive for months on dry surfaces (Chap. 2 and ref [42] ). MRSA has been documented for its ability to survive within hospital dust for up to a year [89] . Further, frequently touched hospital surfaces, such as doorknobs, have been implicated as reservoirs from which pathogens can be routinely recovered and thus transferred [56] . MRSA, like VRE, is ubiquitous in the hospital environment, especially in the vicinity of patients known to be colonized or infected [22, 24] . The chief method of spread is poor compliance with infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, by healthcare workers. Several studies have described endemic and epidemic contamination of the environment with MRSA. A recent review by Dancer and colleagues found that the site contamination mean for common objects in the patient's room with MRSA was 37 %, with high percentages found for such surfaces as overbed tables (40 %), bed rails (27 %), and other furniture (27 %) [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 810, "end": 814, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1364, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1474, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1775, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1779, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2259, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2436, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2571, "end": 2575, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2579, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3060, "end": 3064, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Contamination of Medical Equipment"}, {"text": "The risk of acquiring MRSA or VRE by a patient being admitted into a room that was previously occupied by a patient known to harbor MRSA or VRE was described by Huang and colleagues [37] .

Specifically, amongst the patients whose prior room occupant was MRSA positive (n \u00bc 1,454), 3.9 % of this cohort acquired MRSA, while only 2.9 % of the patients who occupied a room previously housing a MRSA negative patient (n \u00bc 8697) acquired MRSA.

Healthcare workers have the potential to transfer these microbiological contaminants not only from patient to patient but amongst themselves and back to surfaces, refreshing or adding to the complexity of the microbial reservoir involved in transmission. There have been many studies looking at the control of contamination of common hospital touch surfaces both from hand to surface contact and vice versa. Investigators have shown that the gloves of nurses frequently collected viable MRSA after touching inanimate objects near colonized patients [16] . In concert with aggressive hand hygiene campaigns recent hygiene guidelines specifically recommend that particular attention be paid to the disinfection of patient-care surfaces, especially surfaces designated \"high touch objects\" (HTOs) as a target of infection prevention and control [78] . The guidelines note that such objects could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) or by contacting medical equipment that subsequently contacts patients [8, 29, 64, 67, 72, 73, 90] . Routine or daily cleaning coupled with cleaning immediately after patient discharge (terminal cleaning) of the surfaces and objects within the room with subsequent application of a hospital grade disinfectant has been an accepted method for controlling and limiting the spread of infectious agents [68] .

However, unlike UV and vapor phase oxygen radicals (H 2 O 2 ) that distribute their antimicrobial activity through the atmosphere, this technology requires the microbe come in contact or be in close proximity with the material in order to facilitate its antimicrobial activity. In contrast to UV and HVP, once placed, this no-touch system simply requires that the fugitive microbe come in contact with the surface in order to effect disinfection. Thus, the inactivation or killing of the microbe does not require any user intervention once deployed. One such example of this type of no-touch technology is solid antimicrobial copper. The resident microbial burden associated with the built environment is continuously reduced through the strategic placement of solid copper surfaces onto critical high touch surfaces within the patient care setting [75] . Copper has been used by humans for millennia, first as tools and then as a measure to fight the spread of infectious agents. Metallic copper intrinsically displays a strong antibacterial activity in aquatic systems [2, 38] as well as on dry surfaces [32, 54, 96, 102, 104] . In 2008 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered five families of copper-containing alloys as antimicrobial, establishing that products manufactured from one of these registered alloys can make public health claims wherein the label indication states that the alloys kill greater than 99.9 % of bacteria within 2 h of exposure [87] . It is anticipated that the solid antimicrobial copper surfaces will remain microbiocidal for the life of the product (>10 years). A variety of controlled studies have looked at the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against specific human pathogens [54, 63, 92, 98, 102, 104, 105] . In fact solid copper surfaces have been found to be microbicidal to well over 30 bacteria, fungi and viruses. Of the microbes listed in Table 4 .1, five were evaluated in the studies used to grant the public health registration by the United States EPA. The public health claims granted illustrate the robust nature of the antimicrobial activity. Alloys granted registration contain greater than 60 % metallic copper and were found to continuously kill greater than 99.9 % of Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria within 2 h of exposure even after repeated contamination illustrating how solid copper surfaces will inhibit the buildup of microorganisms between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1161, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1165, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1201, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1205, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1210, "text": "102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1215, "text": "104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1575, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1838, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1842, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1846, "text": "92,", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1850, "text": "98,", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "104,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1865, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2004, "end": 2011, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Antimicrobial Copper: A Continuously Active No-Touch Disinfection Solution for Healthcare"}, {"text": "The public health claims attributed to solid copper have been evaluated to limit the bacterial burden found on commonly touched surfaces and objects in active healthcare environments.

Upon coming in contact with the metallic copper surfaces of objects, the electron potential of the microbe in concert with copper facilitates a cascade of irreversible events leading to the rapid death of the bacterium. Given the inherent ability of solid metallic copper and its alloys containing greater than 60 % copper for the conduction of electricity, the electrons resident in the membrane of the bacterium that are sufficiently close to the metallic surface coupled with the high flux required by living cells result in the rapid collapse of the proton motive force of the microbe. The subsequent dissipation of the proton motive force (PMF) has been observed through the use of dyes that measure the membrane potential. Warnes and others have reported on this observation on numerous occasions for both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria [91] [92] [93] 95] . Subsequent to the collapse of the membrane potential a concomitant production of free radicals immediately develops within the cytoplasm of the bacterium. The free radicals facilitate the peroxidation of the membrane, bleaching of cellular proteins and the cleavage and subsequent complete destruction of the nucleic acids resident in the cytoplasm of the effected microbes. Additionally upon peroxidation of the membrane there is a loss of membrane integrity resulting in the subsequent leakage of the cytoplasm from the cell and diffusion mediated transport of copper ions into the cytoplasm. The copper ions then act in concert with the free radicals resulting in a Fenton reaction that leads to further irreparable damage to the cell [91] . The entire process occurs quickly resulting in the collapse of a population within minutes. Thus, the likelihood that the population will develop resistance to this multifaceted mechanism of death is unlikely. There have been reports in the literature of bacteria being isolated from copper coins but upon challenging the 'resistant' isolates they were found to be uniformly sensitive to metallic copper [71] .

Through our discussion here we hope that we have been able to identify potential avenues for improvement with adjunctive use of newer technologies. These include the use of UV light and HPV disinfection, and the potential value of the use of solid antimicrobial copper surfaces.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "Through a multifaceted and continuously active mechanism of action, solid copper surfaces placed in key locations within the patient room can significantly reduce the overall microbial burden; have demonstrated their ability to continuously maintain this concentration at a level representing a minimal risk for HAI acquisition and most importantly, have translated meaningful benefit to patients by their association with significant reduction of HAI.
