With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The toxic effects caused by inhalation of gases and particles, ingested chemicals can also have profound effects on the lungs. The pulmonary circulation receives the total cardiac blood output and the lungs are susceptible to injury from blood-borne toxicants since the lungs are capable of metabolizing a variety of xenobiotics and may form metabolites that are more or less toxic than the parent compound (Zhang et al., 2006). Similar to the upper respiratory tract, toxicity from air- or blood-borne toxicants is dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of defense mechanisms.",

The usual procedure is intratracheal instillation of formalin fixative (4\u20136 mL) into the airways followed by ligation of the trachea to maintain the expanded state of the alveoli and immersion in fixative to complete fixation. Instilling an excessive volume of fixative will cause distortion and disruption of alveolar walls, while a less than adequate volume will result in incomplete expansion of the lung. For stereology and morphometric studies, the lung must be fixed under constant pressure\u201425 cm of water pressure will result in uniform expansion without distortion. The methods for stereology and morphometry are very well defined (Bolender et al., 1993, Weibel et al., 2007). The pathologist must be aware that intratracheal instillation may carry material from the major airways into the alveoli, and displace lung exudates and inflammatory cells thereby masking subtle inflammatory effects\u2014vascular perfusion of fixative is the method of choice if it is important to maintain the mucous layer or determine the precise location of cells and any particulate matter in the airways. Intratracheal instillation may create artifactual changes such as rupture of alveoli that could be misinterpreted as emphysema, or diffusion of fixative into peribronchiolar and perivascular interstitial tissue that may be misinterpreted as edema (Renne et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The primordium of the respiratory system develops from a diverticulum of the ventral wall of the primitive foregut with the formation of the tracheobronchial groove (primitive trachea) and two endodermal lung buds which invade the mesoderm and join at the midline to form the primordial lung. The lung buds undergo branching morphogenesis to give rise to the branching tubular primordium of the lung by interacting with the mesoderm (McAteer, 1984, Morse et al., 1979, Yamada et al., 2002). Around embryonic day 13.5, the right lung bud divides into three primitive bronchi, while the left bud stays undivided and forms a single bronchus (Yamada et al., 2002, McAteer, 1984, Morse et al., 1979). Commonly described histological stages in mammalian lung development include the following: (1) Pseudoglandular stage (E13\u2013E18.5) where the epithelial diverticulum from the foregut divide and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme; (2) Canalicular stage (E21\u2013E22) where differentiation of the epithelium of the future gas exchange region occur along with vascularization and angiogenesis; (3) Saccular stage (E23\u2013birth) where the aerated appearance of the lung is evident because of the remodeling and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells; and (4) Alveolar stage (PND ~4 to ~21) where alveolar formation and maturation occurs (Burri and Moschopulos, 1992, Warburton et al., 2010, Yamada et al., 2002). Around E17 and E18 the lung is predominantly composed of branching, tubular airways surrounded by mesenchyme. The branching of airways continues on E19 and E20. Around E23 the lung is composed of saccular structures which represent prospective alveolar acini. At birth, the rat lung consists of saccular structures which gradually progresses to mature alveoli by PND 21 (Burri, 1974; Burri and Moschopulos, 1992).",

The majority of alveoli are formed during the first 3 weeks of life with the outgrowth of secondary septa that transform the saccules into the alveolar sacs and alveoli.

The wall is approximately 1 mm thick and is supported by 24 circular cartilages (Hebel and Stromberg, 1976). Proximal to its bifurcation, the trachea dilates and then divides asymmetrically into left and right primary (extrapulmonary) bronchi. The lung has a single left lobe and four right lobes that follow the bifurcations of the bronchial tree (Figure 23.1\n). Three to 4 mm distally, the right primary bronchus gives rise first to the cranial lobar bronchus, followed by the middle lobar bronchus and the accessory lobar bronchus, and finally terminates as the caudal lobar bronchus. These bronchi conform to the lobes of the right lung, which consist of the anterior (apical or cranial), middle (cardiac), median (azygous or accessory), and posterior (caudal) lobes. The left primary bronchus serves the single large left lobe, and 8 mm distal to the bifurcation, gives rise to a ventral branch and further distally, three dorsolateral, three dorsomedial, and three ventral segmental bronchi arise. Small plates of cartilage support the walls of the extrapulmonary bronchi but are not present in the walls of the intrapulmonary airways.",

The transition from conducting (bronchioles) to respiratory airways is abrupt, with a short poorly developed respiratory bronchiole giving rise to the pulmonary acinus (Peake and Pinkerton, 2015). The rat lacks the well-developed respiratory bronchiole that is characteristic of primate lungs including those of humans. The pulmonary acinus, which serves as the gas exchange unit, consists of a branching system of alveolar ducts (approximately six generations in the rat) ending blindly in alveolar sacs (Figure 23.2\n). Alveoli evaginate from the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. The average diameter of the alveoli is 70.2 \u00b1 7.0 mm. The terminal bronchiole, alveolar ducts, and associated alveoli are often referred to as the centriacinar region of the lung.\n",

The bronchial arteries, considered to be the nutrient artery of the lung, supply the lower half of the trachea, lungs, bronchi, vasa vasorum of pulmonary artery and vein, visceral pleura, and associated lymph nodes. In general, there are two bronchial arteries, left and right, which arise from subclavian artery or its primary branches (Ferreira et al., 2001). The left and right pulmonary arteries from the pulmonary trunk, deliver blood to the lung for gas exchange and to the pleura. The pulmonary artery gives rise to one axial artery for each lobe, which provides larger branches that follow the airways and smaller branches that do not. Arteries following the airways extend to the level of the alveolar ducts (Hislop and Reid, 1978). Bronchial-pulmonary arterial anastomoses occur near the hilum in the rat and rare extrapulmonary anastomoses can occur (Ferreira et al., 2001, McLaughlin, 1983). The pulmonary venous system drains the pleura, alveoli, bronchioles, and most bronchi. The confluence of veins from the pulmonary lobules form pulmonary veins, one from each lobe, that join to form a single pulmonary vein drain into the left auricle (Nakakuki, 1983, Hosoyamada et al., 2010). The bronchial veins drain the trachea, esophagus, lungs, bronchi, and associated lymph nodes and enter the superior vena cava.",

The visceral pleura of rats is thin compared to that of humans and large animals (Peake and Pinkerton, 2015). Also, the visceral pleura of rats have sparse lymphatic vessels as opposed to an extensive lymphatic network seen in humans (Leak and Jamuar, 1983).

In the rat, the epithelium of the trachea thins distally. There is zonation of ciliated cells in the trachea with cilia rich zones over the tracheal ligaments with fewer ciliated cells over the tracheal cartilages (Oliveira et al., 2003). In the proximal trachea, distal trachea, extrapulmonary bronchus, intrapulmonary bronchus, and bronchioles, approximately 17%, 33%, 35%, 53%, and 65% of cells, respectively, are ciliated (Jeffery and Reid, 1975). The remaining cells are predominantly secretory cells (serous, goblet, or Club cells). Greater details of the cell types and their density are provided in other publications (Reynolds et al., 2015, Plopper and Hyde, 2015).

Neurosecretory cells are identified ultrastructurally by characteristic electron-dense secretory cytoplasmic granules that contain serotonin, calcitonin, bombesin, and encephalin (Adriaensen et al., 2003). Immunohistochemical staining with Protein G product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), calcitonin gene-related peptide, synaptophysin and synaptic vesicle protein-2 has been used to identify pulmonary neurosecretory cells (Pan et al., 2014, Adriaensen et al., 2003). Aggregates of approximately 10\u201320 of these cells are found at bronchiolar bifurcations and are known as neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) (Gosney and Sissons, 1985). They are sometimes associated with unmyelinated axons and are thought to function as chemoreceptors. The NEB are sensitive to oxygen tension in the inspired air, and hypoxia will cause degranulation of the cells (Adriaensen et al., 2003, Haworth et al., 2007).",

Under normal conditions in the rat, the alveolar macrophage can proliferate to maintain and replenish the normal pulmonary macrophage population (Shellito et al, 1987). During the first week of life, alveolar macrophages develop from fetal monocytes which differentiate into long-lived cells in response to an instructive signal provided by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Guilliams et al., 2013). The extent to which blood monocytes contribute to this stable population of alveolar macrophages is uncertain (Shellito et al., 1987). In inflammatory conditions, circulating monocytes arising from the bone marrow also serve as a source of alveolar macrophages (Misharin et al., 2017). It is estimated that more than 1 million macrophages are cleared from the lung to the oropharynx hourly (Spritzer et al., 1968), thus serving as an important mechanism for clearance of particulate matter from the lung.",

Two types of arteries branch from the axial artery to supply each lobe. One type arises at an acute angle and the second type branches at a right angle from the axial artery (Lane et al., 1983). Morphologically, the two types of vessels differ with respect to their muscular layers. At the hilum of the lung the tunica media of the pulmonary artery consists of a circumferentially arranged layer of smooth muscle bounded by internal and external elastic laminae. Some arteries have an oblique muscle layer external to the external elastic lamina and the circular muscular layer. The oblique muscle layer makes the vessel wall appear unusually thick relative to the diameter of the lumen and has been mistaken for medial hypertrophy. As these arteries decrease in size, the circular muscle layer ends, but the oblique muscle layer continues as a discrete spiral bundle (Figure 23.5\n). On cross-section, the vessel may appear to have an irregularly thickened muscle. Eventually the arterial branches become nonmuscular, usually at the level of the alveolar duct. The function of this oblique muscle segment is not known (Meyrick et al., 1978).",

There is great variation in the number of layers of cardiac muscle around the pulmonary vein. The external longitudinal layers extend further than the circular muscle layer.

The fungus causes a host-specific infection presenting as two distinct disease syndromes in immunocompromised and immunocompetent rats. Infection may be fatal in neonates. With exposure to chemicals with immunosuppressive properties, evidence of P. carinii infection may be observed. In immunocompromised rats, P. carinii proliferates uncontrolled in the lung, causing dyspnea, weight loss, and death. Histologically, the organism appears as abundant foamy material and debris filling the alveoli accompanied by interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. In clinically normal immunocompetent rats, P. carinii causes a self-limiting inflammatory lung disease. Gross pulmonary lesions of P. carinii infection are visible in 50% or more of infected rats 4\u20135 weeks after infection, and appear as 1\u20134 mm gray, flat to raised lesions randomly distributed throughout all lungs lobes. These lesions will usually resolve after another 8\u201312 weeks. Characteristic histologic lung lesions consist of mild to severe multifocal perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages and thickening of the alveolar septa by mild to severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrates (Figure 23.8\n). Multinucleated giant cells may sometimes be present. There may be marked Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis in areas of the interstitial infiltrates. After some time, infiltrates in the septa and alveoli are resolved. However, perivascular lymphocyte infiltration persists. Historically, these changes have been attributed to rat respiratory virus (Livingston et al., 2011, Henderson et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2014). Histologically, silver stains such as Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver (GMS) can be used to demonstrate the organism within the alveoli. However, fungi cannot be demonstrated in all cases (Livingston et al., 2011). Diagnosis can be confirmed by performing PCR on lung tissue, and infection detected by serological surveillance and monitoring of immunocompetent animals (Henderson et al., 2012). Because P. carinii infection causes significant lung inflammation, it can be a confounding factor in inhalation studies, and should be considered when unexpected lymphohistiocytic inflammatory lesions are observed in the lungs of rats.",

In the past, many of the Sendai virus infections in rats were complicated by concomitant infection with M. pulmonis. Clinical disease and respiratory tract lesions in rats have rarely been attributed to Sendai virus alone and the virus is seldom detected serologically. Respiratory tract lesions include mild to moderate chronic active inflammation in the nasal cavity with focal to diffuse epithelial necrosis. In the lung, there is focal alveolar and multifocal peribronchial and peribronchiolar chronic active inflammation that resolves in 3\u20135 days. The presence of virus in bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar epithelium is followed by necrosis of the epithelium with regeneration and inflammation. In resolving stages, there is prominent lymphocyte and plasma cell peribronchial and peribronchiolar cuffing with mononuclear cell infiltrates in the alveolar septa that may persist for several weeks (Barthold et al., 2016). The damage to the respiratory epithelium of airways has the potential to interfere with particle clearance and severely compromise inhalation studies. Since Sendai virus may interfere with the pulmonary immune response and increase the rate of cell replication, especially in the small airways, this viral infection also has the potential to interfere with toxicological studies of chemicals given by other routes as well.",

However, severe acute lung injury from a single exposure to highly irritant chemicals may induce a rapid fibrogenic response that may or may not be reversible (Renne et al., 2009). Critical to the development of fibrosis is the release of fibrogenic cytokines and fibronectin from pulmonary macrophages activated during the inflammatory response. Fibroblasts migrate into the fibrin casts and produce collagen. Depending on the extent and severity of injury, fibrosis may resolve slowly or may not completely resolve. Chronic exposure of rats to 2,3-butanedione (Morgan et al., 2016), cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (Bucher, 1991), indium phosphide (NTP, 2001), nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NTP, 1996b), and ozone (NTP, 1994) by inhalation has been reported to induce fibrosis.",

Small numbers of alveoli or an entire lobe may be affected. There may be little or no associated inflammation, but alveolar macrophages may be more abundant and the alveolar lining cells are more prominent than normal. Although, it is referred to as alveolar proteinosis, the composition of the acellular material is shown to be lipoprotein, rich in phospholipid and serum protein (Bomhard, 2017, Seymour and Presneill, 2002, Hook, 1991, Renne et al., 2009). In humans, alteration in surfactant production and degradation are considered to be the possible causes, and similar mechanism is considered to be involved in rats experimentally exposed to quartz (Seymour and Presneill, 2002, Bomhard, 2017, Hook, 1991). At the molecular level, GM-CSF has been shown to play a critical role (Seymour and Presneill, 2002). Increased surfactant production associated with Type II cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia has been demonstrated in these conditions (Porter et al., 2001, Hook, 1991). It has also been postulated that the dust accumulates in the alveolar macrophages and interferes with the normal clearance of the surfactant produced by Type II cells. In humans, defective macrophage function is also thought to lead to this condition. Granular eosinophilic proteinaceous concretions associated with inflammation have been seen in the lungs of rats inhaling cobalt sulfate. Exposure to cobalt, cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (Bucher, 1991), gallium arsenide (NTP, 2000), indium phosphide (NTP, 2001), metal working fluids, nickel subsulfide (NTP, 1996a), nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NTP, 1996b), aluminum, silicon dioxide, silica, quartz, and titanium dioxide by inhalation has been reported to result in alveolar proteinosis (Bomhard, 2017).",

In these studies, the response may be simple and limited to accumulation of only macrophages within the alveoli, but more frequently, the infiltrates accompany variable Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury with infiltrates of neutrophils, lymphocytes and cholesterol cleft formation and fibrosis. The infiltrating macrophages are generally hypertrophic with a foamy or hypereosinophilic cytoplasmic appearance and may contain eosinophilic crystalline material.",

In toxicology studies, the inflammatory response may be directly related to the nature and concentration of the inhaled toxicant, site of contact or deposition within the lung, the duration of exposure, the fragility of the epithelium, and type of injury that results. The primary pattern of inflammation is usually bronchiolar/alveolar because the epithelium of the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts and adjacent alveoli are sites of initial and maximum contact for vapors and aerosols, and/or deposition of particulate agents. Inhalation of mildly toxic vapors or particulates may cause a transient serous, fibrinous, or suppurative exudate with variable numbers of neutrophils.

The sequelae to repair of degeneration and necrosis of the epithelium of the bronchi, bronchioles alveolar ducts, and alveoli are generally similar to those described for the upper respiratory tract. Following necrosis of the airway epithelium, the denuded airway surface is re-epithelialized by proliferation of basal cells and/or nonciliated cells at the margins of the lesion. Depending on when the lesion is observed relative to the time of injury, the degree and duration of injury and the relative rates of cell loss and proliferation, one of several different morphological changes is seen. The regenerating epithelium first consists of flattened cells with round to oval nuclei and slightly basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 23.16\n). If the injury is not prolonged, the regenerating cells rapidly become cuboidal and differentiate into ciliated or nonciliated cells. If there is continued injury and cell loss, differentiation does not occur and the epithelium may become pseudostratified or stratified with one to three layers of undifferentiated cells that are irregular in shape. Squamous metaplasia may ensue with differentiation into typical stratified squamous epithelium. If the rate of cell loss diminishes due to metabolic accommodation to the irritant, the regenerating epithelium will differentiate, but the height of the cells will be increased and there may be increased numbers of serous and goblet cells. The hyperplastic epithelium may also be irregular and folded due to crowding of the cells (Figure 23.17\n). Regeneration of alveolar epithelium follows a similar pattern. The denuded alveolar basement membrane is first covered by irregular polyhedral cells derived from the proliferating alveolar Type II cells, and the alveolar epithelium becomes simple cuboidal in appearance (Figure 23.18, Figure 23.19\n). These cells differentiate and become alveolar Type I cells as the injury diminishes. Prolonged low-level injury may result in metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, which is characterized by replacement of Type I cells with ciliated cells and Club cells (Figure 23.20\n). Type II cell hyperplasia is a common response to inhalation of pulmonary toxicants (Miller and Hook, 1990, Schwartz, 1986). With inhaled aerosols or particulate matter, the centriacinar region of the lung is most commonly affected. Regenerative hyperplasia of the bronchial or alveolar epithelium is usually accompanied by some degree of inflammation and, if the injury is severe, fibrosis.",

Hyperplasia of the alveolar epithelium is characterized by a focal increase in Type II cells lining the interalveolar septa. The Type II cells may be contiguous, and the alveolar epithelium will be simple cuboidal in appearance (Figure 23.21, Figure 23.22\n). The cells may have prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles, but there is no cellular atypia and mitotic figures are not common. The interstitium of affected interalveolar septa is more prominent when the hyperplasia is severe, and there may be an increased number of alveolar macrophages, which contributes to the overall appearance of increased cellularity, but other evidence of inflammation is absent. The boundary of the lesion is usually not sharply demarcated and compression of the adjacent parenchyma is not seen.

Histologically, adenomas are well-demarcated masses that may cause compression of the adjacent parenchyma and are frequently located at the periphery of the lung (Figure 23.26, Figure 23.27, Figure 23.28, Figure 23.29\n). In contrast to hyperplasia, there is distortion of the underlying alveolar architecture. The epithelium may be arranged in three histologic patterns: glandular, papillary, or mixed patterns. The alveolar spaces are obliterated to varying extents, and some neoplasms may appear solid. The epithelium is cuboidal to columnar and overlies a delicate fibrovascular stroma. The neoplastic epithelial cells are relatively uniform with round or oval nuclei and moderately abundant cytoplasm, and some may have apical cytoplasmic vacuoles which probably represent lamellar bodies or lipid droplets (Reznik-Schuller and Reznik, 1982, Ohshima et al., 1985). Neoplastic cells that are columnar tend to have nuclei that are more basal in location and cytoplasm that is more basophilic than that of cuboidal cells. Small, focal areas of mild cellular atypia or pleomorphism may be present\u2014mitotic figures are rare or absent.",

            "text": "Alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas are often poorly circumscribed (Figure 23.30, Figure 23.31\n). However, rapidly growing neoplasms may cause compression of the surrounding parenchyma and appear moderately well demarcated (Figure 23.32, Figure 23.33\n). The carcinomas may invade airways (Figure 23.34, Figure 23.35\n), pleura, or vessels and metastasize to regional lymph nodes, liver, kidney, heart, or other organs. Hallmarks of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas are their heterogeneous growth patterns and cellular pleomophism (Figure 23.36, Figure 23.37\n). Morphologic growth patterns vary from glandular, papillary, solid, to a mixture of these patterns. Well-differentiated carcinomas with a papillary pattern are difficult to distinguish from adenomas. Stratification of the neoplastic epithelium, solid areas of growth, cellular pleomorphism, and atypia or anaplastic cells associated with a scirrhous reaction and local invasion are indications of malignancy (Figure 23.34, Figure 23.35, Figure 23.36, Figure 23.37). Alveolar or glandular patterns of growth are usually observed only when there is a prominent connective tissue component or scirrhous reaction. Scirrhous reactions are not commonly seen in spontaneous alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, but occur in some carcinomas induced by exposure to particulate chemicals such as asbestos, silica, gallium arsenide, cobalt sulfate heptahydrate, cobalt metal, and other particulate chemicals. In some small neoplasms, the scirrhous reaction may be so pronounced that the neoplasm appears to arise within an area of fibrosis. Neoplastic cells within a carcinoma may be pleomorphic, and particularly anaplastic cells may be spindle shaped (Figure 23.38\n). Squamous differentiation is observed in some carcinomas and may be quite prominent (Figure 23.39\n). However, the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is restricted to neoplasms that consist predominantly of squamous cells. Otherwise, neoplasms with squamous differentiation are classified as alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas on the assumption that they are more anaplastic variants of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas. Neoplastic cells may also differentiate into a mucinous cell type; however, such differentiation is rare. Metastases from spontaneous alveolar/bronchiolar\u2019 carcinomas are not commonly observed but may be more frequent with induced carcinomas. The metastatic lesions exhibit a papillary or glandular pattern of growth.",

Although this neoplasm may arise from areas of squamous metaplasia in the bronchi, bronchioles, or alveoli, it may also arise from keratinizing cysts originating in the alveoli. Squamous cell carcinomas efface the normal architecture of the lung and often produce abundant keratin (Figure 23.43, Figure 23.44\n), however there is variability in keratin production between neoplasms. They are highly invasive extending into the contiguous alveolar parenchyma, may induce a marked necrosis and/or scirrhous response, and may metastasize.

These neoplasms are considered to arise from areas of squamous metaplasia in the alveolar epithelium and Club cells, or focal squamous cysts. CKE are discretely irregular, small to expansive cystic lesions that are sharply demarcated from the surrounding alveolar parenchyma (Figure 23.45, Figure 23.46\n). Compression of the adjacent lung parenchyma is usually not observed except in association with larger neoplasms, as growth seems to occur by extension along contiguous alveolar septae from the periphery of the wall. The neoplasm consists of a central, cystic cavity filled with laminated keratin and keratin whorls (pearls), surrounded by a complex wall of squamous epithelium that shows no atypia, dysplasia (abnormal or disorderly differentiation), or invasive growth. The squamous wall varies in thickness, consisting of three to several layers of mature, well-differentiated, squamous epithelium and irregular nests and islands of squamous epithelium that extend along adjacent alveoli resulting in an irregular border. In toxicology/carcinogenicity studies in which increased incidences of CKE occur, the extrapolation and relevance of this finding to human health is incompletely understood since CKE do not occur in the human lung. Therefore, when CKE occurs as a treatment related change in a carcinogenicity study, its relevance to human health should be decided on case-by-case basis, considering other changes and available data (Boorman et al., 1996, Walker et al., 2007).",

When there is good morphologic evidence of an epithelial component in a tumor with sarcomatous areas, the most appropriate diagnosis is carcinoma. However, some pulmonary neoplasms appear to be entirely mesenchymal with no glandular or epithelial areas. These are considered to be mesenchymal in origin and should be classified accordingly. They occur rarely in the F344 rat. Fibrosarcoma (Figure 23.47\n), leiomyoma, and leiomyosarcoma have been observed and are most often metastatic. The morphological features of these neoplasms are similar to those found in other organs and are not described in detail here. Occasionally, metaplastic foci of cartilage or bone are found within a fibrosarcoma. Well-differentiated neoplasms of smooth muscle origin may arise in the wall of bronchi or vessels. Anaplastic sarcomas of uncertain histogenesis are also occasionally observed.",

They have been induced by exposure to various fibers and chemicals (Greaves et al., 2013, Kane, 2006, Doi et al., 2010, Wagner, 1962, Stanton and Wrench, 1972). Grossly, pleural mesotheliomas may be focal or diffuse along the pleura, and grow by expansion rather than infiltration. In rats, all mesotheliomas are considered malignant. Histologically, pleural mesotheliomas may be classified as epithelial, mesenchymal, or a mixture of both (Stanton and Wrench, 1972, Wagner and Berry, 1969, Davis, 1979). Epithelial mesotheliomas are the most common histologic type and may be classified as papillary, tubular, tubulopapillary, or solid. The papillary type is most prevalent and are usually exophytic consisting of single or multiple, irregularly branching, frond-like proliferations of well-vascularized collagenous to fibrous connective tissue stroma lined by a single to several layers of uniformly small, low cuboidal to polyhedral mesothelial cells (Figure 23.48, Figure 23.49\n). The tubular type consists of large atypical pleomorphic cells that form glandular-like structures. The solid type can be quite extensive, florid proliferations composed of abundant prominent stroma with extensive areas of pleomorphic mesothelial cells occurring as clusters, tubular structures, and solid sheets on the surface and within the masses. The mesenchymal variant resembles fibrosarcomas and consists of interlacing bundles of spindle shaped cells that resemble fibroblasts. The mixed variant has both epithelial and mesenchymal components occurring together in varying proportions.",

The primary interest in asbestos is due to its ability to cause mesothelioma, pulmonary fibrosis, and primary lung carcinoma in humans. The acute lesions associated with inhalation of asbestos fibers in the rat are infiltrates of alveolar macrophages in the centriacinar region with thickening of the interstitium and hyperplasia of Type II cells. Asbestos fibers cause fibrosis in long-term (two years) inhalation studies in the rat, similar to what occurs in humans. The degree of pulmonary injury varies with the type of asbestos fiber. Chrysotile asbestos is the most fibrogenic, crocidolite is less active, and amosite is least active. Fiber deposition in the lung is dependent to some extent on fiber length\u2014fibers longer than 11 \u00b5m are less likely to be deposited in the lung than those shorter than 11 \u00b5m. However, once deposited, the longer fibers are less likely to be cleared from the lung and therefore are more fibrogenic than the shorter fibers. Although fiber length and shape are important determinants of fibrogenicity, the availability of reactive groups on the surface of the asbestos fibers may contribute.",

With mild injury, one of the first changes is focal loss of cilia from the respiratory epithelium and loss of the apical blebs from the Club cells. Higher concentrations lead to concentration-dependent cell necrosis in the terminal bronchioles with compensatory proliferation of Club cells. In the alveoli, the Type I cell is more sensitive to injury than the Type II cell, which may be due to its larger surface area. Compensatory proliferation of Type II cells is seen in most cases of alveolar injury. There is a mild inflammatory reaction with accumulation of alveolar macrophages and an increase in thickness of the blood-air barrier due to collagen deposition in the interstitium with chronic injury.
