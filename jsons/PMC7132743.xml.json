Surprisingly, the virus appeared in Bulgaria and Hungary between 1975 and 1978 associated with a poliomyelitis-like syndrome, and isolates from these outbreaks caused flaccid paralysis after inoculation into monkeys [4]. The virus had evolved to simulate poliovirus disease. After another interval, the virus appeared in Southeast Asia in 1997 as the cause of fatal rhomboencephalitis with cardiopulmonary collapse in children under 5 years of age [5], [6]. This brainstem localization of clinical findings, imaging studies, and neuropathologic findings indicate a further evolution of neurovirulence to cause a novel and highly lethal illness.",

Subsequently, the virus was associated with a dengue-like illness in African children and later with occasional cases of aseptic meningitis in the Middle East. Ironically, the first documented cases of encephalitis due to West Nile virus were in New York City in 1954 after 95 patients with advanced cancer were inoculated with the virus on the premise that the \u201charmless\u201d virus might selectively destroy tumor cells. Nine patients developed encephalitis, and virus was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients [8]. Naturally occurring cases of encephalitis began to appear in the Mediterranean basin in the 1990s. A radical change in the epidemiologic pattern was then seen, with large epidemics of encephalitis with high mortality rates. The first epidemics occurred in Bucharest in 1996 and then in Volgograd in 1999. Clearly, a more virulent strain of the virus had evolved in this region [9].",

They ranged in age from 58 to 87 years, had no common exposure, reported no family illnesses, and spent their evening hours out of doors where investigators found many mosquito larvae in stagnant water. The disease was correctly assumed to be arthropod borne but tentatively diagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis. A subsequent virus isolate from a bird dying with encephalitis in the neighboring Bronx was identified as West Nile virus, and reassessment of the human encephalitis cases showed them to be caused by West Nile virus [10]. Sequence analysis of the New York virus showed striking similarity to an isolate from a goose in Israel in the previous year [11].",

Initially the disease was thought to be Japanese encephalitis, an endemic arthropod-borne disease in the region; however, the new disease affected primarily adults, occurred in household clusters, was associated with contacts with pigs that were ill, and affected some persons who had been immunized against Japanese encephalitis virus. Each of these factors suggested an alternative cause. In March of 1999, a paramyxovirus named Nipah virus was recovered and related to the disease [15]. An outbreak in a single abattoir in Singapore gave insight into the epidemiology of the infection, since only workers transporting or slaughtering pigs became infected. No family member or medical caregiver had evidence of infection, indicating a lack of human-to-human spread [16]. The slaughter of tens of thousands of pigs in Malaysia brought an end to the outbreak, but only after over 100 patients had died.",

Like HIV-1, HCV is defined by multiple subtypes and immense molecular heterogeneity within subtypes with varying disease severity, largely evident as inflammatory liver disease, which progresses to a cirrhotic state. HCV-infected persons also report neurologic symptomatology, including neurocognitive symptoms (fatigue, mental slowing, poor concentration, forgetfulness, apathy) in the absence of liver disease and exhibit neurologic signs including low-grade encephalopathy (impaired attention and learning, psychomotor slowing) with an overall prevalence of 13% [22] and peripheral neuropathy (10%) [23] with or without cryoglobulinemia.

Multiple studies indicate that leukocytes are chronically infected, together with a persistent viremia. More recently, several studies suggest that HCV-encoded genome (both positive and negative strand RNA) and proteins are detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, often in the setting of HIV-1 coinfection. Both monocytoid (macrophages and microglia) and astrocytes can express selective viral proteins. The extent to which accompanying cellular (and humoral) immunity contributes to neural tissue injury as a bystander cytotoxic effect, or whether virus-encoded proteins are secreted and subsequently injure proximate cells (as proposed for HIV-1) remains uncertain to date. Nonetheless, quantitative neuropsychologic studies and neuroimaging including MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) disclose abnormalities in HCV-infected patients, which are compounded by HIV-1 coinfection. Although pegylated interferon-alpha is an effective therapy for some HCV subtypes, its impact on HCV-related neurologic disease remains uncertain. As this epidemic grows, the increased risk of neurologic disease requires vigilance and intervention as indicated.",

The virus could not have persisted in early Neolithic or nomadic cultures. Indeed, the typical exanthem of measles was not described by Greek and Roman physicians but was first recorded by Rhazes of Baghdad. He dated its arrival in the Arab world to the sixth century. Contemporary sequence analysis indicates that the measles virus was probably derived from rhinderpest virus of African or Asian cattle, suggesting an early zoonotic spread across species barriers. The appearance of measles in France and Northern Europe has been dated to the eighth century after the Moorish invasion. Apparently, it was confined below the Pyrenees for centuries until an army crossed the mountains, maintaining the virus by soldier-to-soldier spread. Today, a similar virus could cross this geographic barrier in hours.",

Indeed, multiple molecular tools have been used over the past decade to characterize West Nile virus, the SARS coronavirus, and Kaposi's sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus (HHV-8) [28]. The recent development of this combined diagnostic approach was particularly rewarding because it led to the discovery of a new human arena virus causing fever and encephalitis. Both PCR and oligonucleotide microarray studies were unremarkable, but subsequent high-throughput DNA pyrosequencing of patient-derived cDNA, together with bioinformatics analyses of protein sequences to exclude human sequences, resulted in the identification of a new neurovirulent arena virus. This metagenomic pyrosequencing approach, albeit, cumbersome at a bioinformatics level, is unbiased in terms of identifying novel sequences and will be invaluable for the discovery and detection of new infectious agents of the nervous system [29].",

The challenge is to anticipate them, detect them early, and respond in effective ways that will contain them (\nBox 3). First, surveillance must be global, and international cooperation is crucial. It is easier to contain Ebola virus with improved infection control in African hospitals than to counter it at international airports. The SARS virus epidemic might have been restricted by quarantines more promptly had information and efforts been shared internationally. New methods of rapid identification and characterization of agents are being developed, but the capacity to perform these studies should be put in place worldwide with major strengthening of public health infrastructure. We cannot prevent the emergence of new microbes and diseases, but we can improve our knowledge of the ecology and molecular biology of these agents. We also can anticipate that every change we make in the environment may impact on the evolution, new encounters, or habitats of these agents.Box 3Control of emerging infections\nGlobal surveillance and cooperationRapid identification methodsCharacterization to determine originDevelopment and deployment of vaccines and drugsStrengthen the public health infrastructure worldwide\n",

Aside from new antiviral drugs that are being developed for a range of viruses such as tenofovir and others, strategies involving the use of therapeutic vaccines, the delivery of monoclonal antibodies, or the use of therapeutically primed dendritic cells represent highly novel approaches. The use of these agents has not yet reached neurovirology; however, other technologies, including the use of nanotechnology-derived liposomes for drug delivery to the brain, are now reality. Perhaps the greatest promise lies in the use of small molecules to prevent bystander-mediate injury of the brain. For example, the recent use of minocycline, beta-lactam antibiotics, and free radical scavengers as neuroprotective therapies raises exciting possibilities, albeit, with some caution given the variable outcomes from different studies.",
