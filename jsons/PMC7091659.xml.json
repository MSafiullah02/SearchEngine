This problem is associated with high rates of early treatment-related mortality (TRM) owing to delayed engraftment. In order to overcome this barrier, we investigated a strategy by which patients without higher priority donors were to be transplanted with an unrelated CB unit that should contain at least 2 \u00d7 107 total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg of recipient weight. If one unit containing that cell number was not available, a second unit had to be added in order to achieve that target.

Patients were not eligible if they had an HLA-compatible related or unrelated donor, defined as an unrelated donor that matched on HLA-A, -B and DRB1, or a related donor that either matched on HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 or had one mismatch in these loci.

The most important variable was disease status at transplantation, associated with extensive prior treatment and poor tolerance to transplant-associated toxicities, factors that likely increased TRM. Here, selection of relatively large CB units with a median total infused nucleated cell count/kg of 3.2 \u00d7 107 did not impact early mortality, as observed in other series.10, 11 Use of CB units containing TNC doses below 1\u20131.5 \u00d7 107 is associated with high rates of engraftment failure, and accordingly, we attempted combination of units in three cases in order to optimize the cell dose. Despite our approach, we observed a high rate of primary engraftment failure. It is possible that a diagnosis of CML was an added risk factor in two of our cases as it has been suggested.11 In the multicenter Cord Blood Transplantation (COBLT) study, 34% of the adult patients failed to achieve donor hematopoiesis.12 Comparisons of published results are sometimes difficult to perform given that definitions of engraftment failure differ in the literature, but it is commonly accepted that lack of neutrophil recovery by day 42 indicates a very low likelihood of success. The competing risk of death before engraftment is frequently not taken into consideration, an approach that makes the interpretation of the data very difficult and subject to biases.",

All patients with acute leukemia were in complete remission, whereas most of the CML patients were in chronic phase, comprising a better risk group. Lower 100-day mortality has been reported by several single-center studies.14, 15 The Minnesota group transplanted 23 patients with a median age of 24 years and observed a 6-month TRM of 22%.14 Although these results may indicate the influence of growing experience using this source of stem cells, one cannot underestimate the effect of patient selection on outcomes.",

Such degree of donor\u2013recipient mismatch is now a well-known risk factor for poor survival.11 Three patients were so treated (combined with another unit in one instance). Therefore, the degree of matching contributed to the poor results. Another potential criticism is our GVHD prophylaxis that employed \u2018mini\u2019 methotrexate. There is evidence that this drug may contribute to excess mortality, at least when used in higher doses than the ones employed here. Interestingly, the combination of tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate has been used without excessive toxicity in the pediatric setting.16",
