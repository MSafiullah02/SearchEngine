This function can be optimized using evolutionary computation approaches to (near) optimally decide the center and area of infectious disease hotspots. Take the genetic algorithm as an example. The center and radius can be encoded as an individual and the number of the infectious disease cases divided by the radius can be adopted as the fitness measure. Through a genetic learning process, an optimal or sub-optimal solution could be found, representing the infectious disease hotspots. Other kinds of evolutionary computation methods can also be applied to solve such optimization problems. We are currently experimenting with a selected set of such methods to perform spatial-temporal hotspot analysis. These methods are being evaluated based on their run-time performance, scalability, accuracy, flexibility, and extensibility in the context of ISI data analysis. One particular challenge is to identify multiple hotspots from the data at the same time. Possible solutions include (a) incorporating multiple cluster centers/radii into one fitness function, and (b) using immune algorithms with intrinsic multiple-modal considerations.",
