The genome of SARS-CoV was sequenced by several independent groups. That the SARS genome from Singapore, Canada, Hongkong, Guangzhou and Beijing in China has remained unchanged, as the infection has spread (http://www.nature.com/nsu/030505/030505-10.html) suggests that genetic vaccine maybe an efficient approach to protect from SARS-CoV infection.",

The M gene encodes a protein of 221 amino acids. Analysis of the M protein revealed that a 121 amino acid hydrophilic domain on the inside of the virus particle is believed to interact with the N protein (Qin et al., 2003). It is further reported that there exists an interaction between SARS-CoV N and M protein and the stretch of amino acids (168\u2013208) in the N protein may be critical for such protein\u2013protein interactions (He et al., 2004). Whether the interaction plays role in immune responses induced by SARS-CoV infection is not clear.",

In addition, the basic nature of this peptide suggests it may assist in RNA binding (Marra et al., 2003). In previous study, N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in vaccine setting (Gao et al., 2003), and the mice vaccinated with calreticulin (CRT)/N DNA were capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of SARS virus (Kim et al., 2004). It has been reported that N DNA vaccine could induce SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T cells activity, further experiments demonstrate that SARS-N administration could induce virus-specific cellular responses in human cells using SCID-PBL/hu mouse model (Jin et al., 2005, Okada et al., 2005). Although more than 90% of sera obtained from convalescent SARS patients have antibodies against N (Tan et al., 2004), N antigen did not induce a detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response in mice (Buchholz et al., 2004).",
