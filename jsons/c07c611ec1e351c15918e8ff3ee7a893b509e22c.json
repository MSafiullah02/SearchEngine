The finding could lead to the development of combination therapies that treat the virus while managing the risk of infection-associated immunopathology.",

This causes the release of cytokines and chemokines that attract leukocytes and macrophages to the site of infection. The reaction can lead to a cytokine storm and result in tissue damage and a potentially fatal immune reaction.",

Importantly, influenza-neutralizing antibody titers and the overall cytotoxic T cell response were maintained with use of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR)-binding sphingosine analog. 3 AAL-R was also effective in controlling T cell accumulation in the lungs when given four days after initiation of influenza infection.",
