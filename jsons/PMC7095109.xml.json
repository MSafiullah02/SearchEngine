Average age and APACHE II score were 30.21 \u00b1 9.60 years 13.25 \u00b1 1.90, respectively. Average tidal volume and plateau pressure on conventional ventilation prior to initiation of HFOV were 6.12 \u00b1 1.26 ml/kg of predicted body weight and 27.21 \u00b1 3.85 cm H2O, respectively. In the whole cohort there was a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 24 h, after initiation of HFOV (77.89 \u00b1 32.50 vs. 121.78 \u00b1 37.94, p = 0.005). Earlier application of HFOV was the only significant independent predictor of survival (p = 0.045) on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Survival odds ratio was 7.05 (95 % CI, 1.04\u201347.78) for every day of reduced conventional ventilation. Cox regression analysis of survival rates adjusted for APACHE II score, oxygenation index and time from symptom onset to hospital contact indicated a decrease in survival with increasing duration of conventional ventilation (Fig. 1, Table 1).\n\n",

[1] has shown that even with a lung protective strategy, ventilator induced lung injury is possible. Matthias David et al., had suggested that, an increased conventional ventilation period of more then 3 days prior to HFOV was associated with higher mortality [2]. A recent meta-analysis had re-affirmed this suggestion [3]. However, Casper Bollen et al, [4] had suggested that prolonged conventional ventilation prior to HFOV is not associated with higher mortality. Patients in this case series, randomized to the HFOV group had received conventional ventilation at higher tidal volumes (9.30 \u00b1 2.20 ml/kg of predicted body weight), prior to initiation of HFOV. Limiting the duration of volume controlled ventilation before HFOV may confer a benefit by pre-empting ventilator induced lung injury in these patients.",
