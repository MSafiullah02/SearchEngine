Eight mechanically ventilated juvenile swine underwent 28 ventricular fibrillatory arrests with open cardiac massage. Cardiac massage was administered to achieve target pulmonary blood flow (PBF) as a percentage of pre-cardiac arrest baseline. Non-invasive data, including, EtCO 2 , cerebral rSO 2 (C-rSO 2 ) and renal rSO 2 (R-rSO 2 ) were collected continuously. Our data demonstrate the ability to measure both rSO 2 and EtCO 2 during CPR and after ROSC. During resuscitation EtCO 2 had a strong correlation with goal CO with r = 0.83 (p < 0.001) 95% CI [0.67-0.92]. Both C-rSO 2 and R-rSO 2 had moderate and statistically significant correlation with CO with r = 0.52 (p = 0.003) 95% CI (0.19-0.74) and 0.50 (p = 0.004) 95% CI [0.16-0.73]. The AUCs for sudden increase of EtCO 2 , C-rSO 2 , and R-rSO 2 at ROSC were 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77-0.94], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.8-0.94], and 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-1.00] respectively. Measurement of continuous EtCO 2 and rSO 2 may be used during CPR to ensure effective chest compressions. Moreover, both rSO 2 and EtCO 2 may be used to detect ROSC in a swine pediatric ventricular fibrillatory arrest model.",

Although severe hypoxia and respiratory failure remain the most common cause of pediatric in hospital cardiac arrests, 10-15% have rhythm that requires defibrillation [5] . The outcome of cardiac arrest is dependent on critical interventions, especially early defibrillation, effective chest compressions and assisted ventilation [6, 7] . Invasive blood pressure and cardiac output monitoring provide an accurate means of assessing the effectiveness of chest compressions [8] . However, invasive monitoring at the time of either the arrest or initiation of resuscitation occurs in less than 50% of in-hospital pediatrics cardiac arrest cases and almost never occurs in out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest cases [2] . The need for accurate, non-invasive, and real-time monitoring of both oxygenation and circulation during resuscitation is, therefore, paramount to the improvement of resuscitation outcomes.",

Furthermore, EtCO 2 has been suggested to correlate with cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, and it has also been reported to be a predictor of survival and prognosis in patients after cardiac arrest and resuscitation [10, 11] . However, measurement of EtCO 2 can be particularly unreliable in low-flow states such as during CPR or in the presence of significant pulmonary pathology. Moreover, the accuracy of EtCO 2 measurement depends on proper capnography waveforms that may be difficult to obtain during chest compressions [12, 13] . Finally, EtCO 2 does not provide any meaningful information about the quality of organ perfusion and oxygenation during resuscitation [14] .",

            "text": "Regional oxygen saturation monitoring with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a noninvasive surrogate monitor of regional oxygen saturation (rSO 2 ) [15, 16] . During critical illness, NIRS probes are routinely placed on the forehead to measure cerebral rSO 2 (C-rSO 2 ) and the back to measure renal rSO 2 (R-rSO 2 ), referred to as two-site rSO 2 . Two-site rSO 2 can provide a real-time indicator of the balance between oxygen supply and demand in the intraoperative and intensive care setting. Moreover, two-site rSO 2 represent two opposite poles of circulation, and the compensatory response to low cardiac output can be reflected in a decrease in R-rSO 2 while C-rSO 2 is preserved. This clinical information can help the provider to make treatment decisions and assess the effect of therapeutic interventions in settings of low cardiac output, such as cardiogenic, hemorrhagic and septic shock [17] . Moreover, NIRS does not require pulsatile flow, which makes it an ideal monitoring tool during cardiac arrest [18] . Although NIRS technology has been validated and used in many clinical scenarios, limited studies have examined the role of two-site rSO 2 monitoring during cardiac arrest to assess the effectiveness of chest compressions and detection of ROSC without interrupting resuscitation efforts [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

Subsequently, a 20 g intravenous catheter was placed into an ear vein for additional anaesthetic agents (Propofol, 2-10 mg/kg) prior to the procedure. The animal was intubated with cuffed endotracheal tube and mechanically ventilated under general anaesthesia using mixture of room air and titrated isoflurane (0.5-1.5% inspired concentration). Volumetric capnography monitor (Philips, Carlsbad, CA) was connected to the ventilator circuit via a side stream capnostat sensor placed at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube (between the endotracheal tube and the ventilator circuit). Then animals were deeply sedated with adequate pain control throughout the experiment using fentanyl (3.0-10.0 \u03bcg/kg/h IV) as needed. The tidal volume was initially set at 8-10 mL/kg and the ventilator rate at 12 breaths per minute; ventilator settings then were adjusted to maintain PaCO 2 at 35 to 45 mm Hg. The femoral artery was accessed by percutaneous methods then a 6 Fr sheath was placed and advanced to the abdominal aorta to measure systemic pressure and to withdraw blood for blood gas analysis. A 6 Fr sheath was also placed in the femoral vein by percutaneous methods for further administration of medications. A median sternotomy was performed and the heart was exposed. Finally, an ultrasonic flow probe (PAU Series, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) was placed around the pulmonary artery.",

            "text": "In this study we demonstrate that EtCO 2 and two-site rSO 2 can be used to assess and guide effectiveness of chest compressions especially when resuscitation efforts are suboptimal. As EtCO 2 reflects PBF, and two-site rSO 2 reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and extraction at 2 two different vascular beds [28] , the use of both monitoring devices during resuscitation may provide complementary information on the quality of resuscitation organ perfusion, and tissue oxygenation during CPR. Our result is consistent with the findings of Koyama et al. who reported that C-rSO 2 could reliably assess the quality of chest compressions and improve effectiveness of CPR in adult cardiac arrest patients. However, in that study only C-rSO 2 waveform (not the absolute value) was used to assess the quality of chest compression [26] . In our study the quality of chest compressions was controlled and continuously monitored and the absolute rSO 2 was monitored as well. In contrast to our results, K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen et al. found that C-rSO 2 remained low during high-quality resuscitation and that improvement in CPR was not significantly reflected in C-rSO 2 [27] . However, the assessment of C-rSO 2 was not monitored prior to initiation of CPR and therefore the C-rSO 2 before cardiac arrest was not known. Moreover, quality of CPR provided was monitored using defibrillator with CPR quality analysis features and no other direct or invasive measurements of CPR quality was measured. In regard to EtCO 2, a recent study using a lamb asphyxial cardiac arrest model, Chandrasekharan et al. demonstrated a relationship between EtCO 2 and adequate chest compression during resuscitation, and concluded that a rapid increase in EtCO 2 with a threshold of > 32 mmHg is 100 sensitive and 97% specific in predicting ROSC [29] . Moreover, a recent multicenter study of 583 adult patients with in-and out hospital CA showed that depth of chest compression was associated with higher EtCO 2 which suggest that EtCO 2 monitoring during CPR might be a useful tool to guide effective resuscitation after CA [30] . Our data also suggest that both rSO 2 and EtCO 2 can detect ROSC during CPR without interrupting chest compressions. Although C-rSO 2 , R-rSO 2 , and EtCO 2 were all very sensitive tests to detect ROSC, R-rSO 2 was more specific than both C-rSO 2 and EtCO 2 . Thus adding renal NIRS monitoring during resuscitation might not only guide resuscitation, but can be used to detect with more confidence ROSC. Our results is consistent with Pokorna et al. who showed that a sudden increase in EtCO 2 > 10 mmHg during out-of-hospital CPR could be used as an early indicator of ROSC [31] . Similarly, with the findings of Singer et al. who reported that during outside hospital CA, both mean C-rSO 2 and EtCO 2 during CPR can be used to predict ROSC [32] . They found that EtCO 2 was more sensitive and C-rSO 2 was more specific at predicting ROSC. However, they didn't assess the sensitivity and specificity of sudden increase in both to detect ROSC. Moreover, a growing number of recent studies demonstrated that a higher mean cerebral rSO 2 during CPR was observed in patients who achieved ROSC compared to nonsurvivors [14, 20, 32, 33] . We are not aware of any studies that assessed the ability of two-site rSO 2 to detect ROSC during CPR.",

First, our study included animals with open chest without sufficient thoracic pump function, which may have affected venous return and cardiac output. We acknowledge that our model might not resemble the clinical situation of most critically ill patients who suffer cardiac arrest and require CPR, however, it might be clinically relevant in anaesthetized patients or patients who just undergone cardiac surgery and suffer a sudden, cardiac deterioration and arrest. Second, the cardiac massage was performed by hand and mean PBF goal was used during resuscitation. Also animals received normal saline and/or sodium bicarbonate after ROSC which might led to a transient increase in EtCO 2 without an actual increase in cardiac output during subsequent arrests, however, further analysis of the first VF arrest didn't indicate such effect, in the contrary, EtCO 2 was more sensitive than C-rSO 2 and R-rSO 2 to detect ROSC during the first VF arrests when compared to subsequent arrests (Fig. 4) . Third, all animals had relatively healthy lungs, which may not reflect common pediatric cardiac arrests. This latter point presents a concern as EtCO 2 is affected by alveolar dead space, which may be a confounding factor when assessing changes in CO. Finally, analgosedative drugs were administered, as necessary, to maintain adequate analgesia and anesthesia. The use of these drugs may have affected cardiovascular function and autonomic control during resuscitation.",
