The chirality of drugs has become a major theme in the design, discovery, development, patenting and marketing of new drugs [5] . For many years, including at the time of the approvals of CQ and HCQ, the pharmacopoeias were dominated by racemates. This trend was inverted in the mid-1990s: most of the chiral new molecular entity (NME) drugs were developed and marketed as single enantiomers [5] . The strategy of chiral switches has emergedthe development of a single enantiomer from a chiral drug that has previously been developed (and often approved and marketed) as a racemate or as a mixture of diastereomers. Nevertheless, the development and approval of racemic drugs has continued to be viable and the continuing approval of racemic NMEs could have implications for the persistence of the chiral-switch strategy [6] .",

However, these initiatives and earlier and subsequent studies on HCQ and CQ enantiomers have not led to regulatory single-enantiomer drug approval(s) for any indication.

The rationale on which our call is based is driven by the following considerations. COVID-19 is a pandemic without any approved drug or vaccine. CQ and HCQ could potentially display therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 [2, 3, 8] . The toxicity profiles of CQ and HCQ have been well known for many years; their administration is safe, although both can have serious side effects, especially at high doses or when combined with other medicines. Advantages of (S)-(+)-HCQ (the eutomer) vis-\u00e0-vis (R)-(-)-HCQ and the racemate (R,S)-(\u00b1)-HCQ have been recorded in the above-mentioned patents, especially with regard to retinopathy, a severe side effect of HCQ which is caused by an enantioselective accumulation of the (R)-(-)-HCQ enantiomer in the ocular tissue, R/S ratio = 1.58 \u00b10.24 (in rabbits, EP0588430B1). Furthermore, studies of enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of HCQ reported that there was no (S)-(+)-HCQ \u21cc (R)-(-)-HCQ interconversion between the enantiomers [9] .",

The FDA has just created the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) to speed up coronavirus therapies and move new treatments to patients as quickly as possible.

Demand for HCQ has grown dramatically in recent weeks as a result of the attention raised by the CTAP program.
