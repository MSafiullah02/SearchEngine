            "text": "Rabies is regarded as one of the oldest known and most feared human disease recognized since the early length of civilization (Getachew et al. 2014). According to WHO, rabies poses a threat to more than 3 billion people around the globe with over 59,000 and 21,476 deaths recorded worldwide and in Africa respectively (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018). Rabies virus (RABV) belongs to the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, it is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by neurotropic viruses and is most commonly spread by the bite of a rabid animal (Silva et al. 2013). The RNA genome of the virus encodes five proteins in a highly conserved order, and they code for: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and a viral RNA polymerase (L) (Yousaf et al. 2012). In most mammalian species, RABV is known to cause fatal encephalomyelitis with little or no histopathological evidence of neural destruction in animals dying of rabies (Sugiura et al. 2011). RABV exploits the nervous system (NS) network and predominantly infects the neurons to ensure its progression from the entry site to the exit site (Chopy et al. 2011). Fever, bodily discomfort, general weakness, headache are symptoms of rabies in humans. As disease progresses, abnormal behavior, delirium, insomnia, hallucinations, and respiratory failure may occur (Burgos-C\u00e1ceres 2011a, b). The disease is often fatal once symptoms develop and it remains one of the most ancient and deadly of human infectious diseases (Burgos-C\u00e1ceres 2011a, b).",

In Nigeria, a canine RABV was isolated from a trade dog recently, and it was discovered that its complete genome sequence has a high degree of homology to the canine RABV circulating in Africa (Zhou et al. 2013; Kia et al. 2018). Similarly, molecular characterization of the whole genome of RABV was conducted on trade dogs in Plateau State, Nigeria, which provides insight to improved understanding of the pathogenesis, molecular epidemiology, and rabies control in Nigeria (Kia et al. 2018). The pathogenic RABV has evolved specific mechanisms to evade early immune recognition by the immune system and avoid premature death of infected neurons. The increase in interferon response at the onset of rabies virus infection followed by a decrease in its production as disease progresses has been implicated in several studies (Ito et al. 2010; Srithayakumar et al. 2014). For successful establishment of infection, viral IFN-antagonistic mechanisms therefore play pivotal roles (Brz\u00f3zka et al. 2005), which may provide a viable strategy in combating and/or managing the disease. It has also become apparent that fundamental in the interplay between host cells and viruses are epigenetic changes (Galvan et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Epigenetics can be referred to as heritable changes of gene expression that are not caused by alterations in the primary nucleotide gene sequence (Wise and Charchar 2016). Epigenetic modifications are biochemical changes of the chromatin, in other words, DNA or histones, that are functionally relevant, but do not affect the nucleotide sequence of the genome (Potaczek et al. 2017). Generally, epigenetic modifications largely depend on general concept of what many scientists called writers, erasers and readers with their variability influencing the transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin. DNA methylation is one of the first identified and, at the same time, one of the most widely studied epigenetic modifications in humans. It occurs by covalent methylation of a cytosine within the CpG dinucleotides. Methylation at the fifth position of cytosine (5 mC) in DNA is a well-established epigenetic mark. It is distributed across the genome generally at CpG dinucleotides, which can occur in clusters known as CpG islands (Alashkar et al. 2019). The major role of DNA methylation in mammals is to repress gene expression by recruiting different silencing protein complexes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), which in turn can block the transcription machinery (Alashkar et al. 2019). Histone acetylation status is regulated by two groups of enzymes exerting opposite effects, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to an amino acid group of the target lysine residues in the histone tails, which makes chromatin less compact and aids accessibility to the transcriptional machinery (Alhamwe et al. 2018). It has been proposed that the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression facilitated by miRNAs plays an important role in the fine-tuning of transcriptional programs in the context of bigger regulatory networks and in buffering fluctuations in gene expression resulting from random internal cellular modulation and/or environmental influences (Potaczek et al. 2017). Presently, no study has been done on the epigenetics of Type II interferon gamma in respect to rabies virus infection in mice brain. Consequently, this study investigated the epigenetic modifications associated with IFNG in Challenge virus standard (CVS) strain and Nigerian street rabies virus (SRV) infected mice. Our findings suggest that epigenetic modification via DNA methylation and histone acetylation may have played a role in the expression of type II interferon gamma in Rabies Virus infection.",

            "text": "Rabies remains an important public health problem, with estimated 59,000 annual deaths due to dog-mediated rabies globally (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018). Characteristic of encephalitic rabies in animals includes autonomic dysfunction, hyperexcitability, and aerophobia. Fever, bodily discomfort, general weakness, headache are symptoms of rabies in humans. As disease progresses, abnormal behavior, delirium, insomnia, hallucinations, and respiratory failure may occur (Burgos-C\u00e1ceres 2011a, b). The disease is often fatal once symptoms develop and it remains one of the most ancient and deadly of human infectious diseases (Burgos-C\u00e1ceres 2011a, b). Despite the discovery of rabies vaccine, rabies is still both a neglected disease and reemerging zoonosis (Burgos-C\u00e1ceres 2011a, b). Rabies virus usually evades the host\u2019s immune system, and establishes the disease in the brain (Srithayakumar et al. 2014). Interferon gamma (IFN\ud6fe) production is essential for host resistance to many viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Tato et al. 2018). This is because the host immune response to viral infection is a key factor in determining viral pathogenicity and outcome of infection (Masatani et al. 2013). Consequently, the interferon (IFN) systems represent powerful defense elements of higher organisms that integrate innate and adaptive immunity (Brz\u00f3zka et al. 2006). The pathogenic RABV has also evolved specific mechanisms to evade early recognition by the immune system and avoid premature death of infected neurons (Brz\u00f3zka et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005). RABV virulence relies on mechanism which suppresses the interferon response (Rieder and Conzelmann 2009; Ito et al. 2010; Chopy et al. 2011). In this study, herein, for the first time epigenetic modifications associated with type II gamma interferon gene in Rabies infection was reported.",

Previous studies have detected the immune response in the brain as early as 4 days after peripheral inoculation of RABV in mouse models (Srithayakumar et al. 2014). Similar studies (Wang et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2006; Srithayakumar et al. 2014) also back this up. The findings in this study and others (Wang et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2006; Lafon et al. 2008) show that interferon signaling pathway increases upon RABV infection.",

To further buttress above points, DNA methylation after initial infection with Rabies virus by Methylation specific quantitative PCR (MSqPCR) was examined with results obtained as Percentage Methylated Region (PMR). Based on these findings, there was an observed increase in methylation in the test group from the control group, and a fluctuating pattern in methylation in both CVS and SRV groups as the disease progressed. This result does not follow the conventional pattern where hypermethylation leads to transcriptional repression. However, it has been reported that hypermethylation at 3\u2032CpG may lead to changes in gene conformation, leading to activation of enhancers and subsequent recruitment of transcriptional factors, histone acetyltransferase, and hence transcriptional activation (Da-Hai et al. 2013). Another study indicates the use of alternate promoter, where the transcription machinery to the CpG island is blocked by methylation thereby allowing the use of the basic core promoter of the gene, whereas, in situations where the CpG island is unmethylated, transcription starts from the CpG island in preference to the basic core promoter of the gene (Halpern et al. 2014).",

Global methylation is likely to lead to abrupt mutation which may or may not lead to the up and down regulation of the interferon gamma gene in addition to hypermethylation at 3\u2032CpG that may favor the transition from heterochromatin to euchromatin (Da-Hai et al. 2013). Histone acetylation generally leads to transcriptional activation as previously described (Kurdistani et al. 2004). From this study, there was an increase in Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity in the test group as compared to the control group with a fluctuating pattern in the test group as the disease progressed. Furthermore, proportional increase in activity of DNMT and HAT in relation to control was checked. Both enzymes played their roles but there was a higher proportion of HAT compared to DNMT in both CVS and SRV groups and as such, the up and down regulations of the IFN\ud6fe gene might likely be due to HAT rather than DNMT and it may be histone acetylation counterbalances the effects of DNA methylation here. It was therefore, hypothesized that methylation and histone acetylation may be central to the epigenetic modifications associated with IFN\ud6fe gene in Rabies virus infection.",
