This study aimed to reduce the 30-day pediatric readmission rate on 2 general pediatric services through an intervention to enhance care spanning the hospital stay, discharge, and follow-up process. Methods: A multidisciplinary team developed an intervention bundle based on a needs assessment and evidence-based models of transitional care. The intervention included pre-discharge planning with a transition coordinator, screening and intervention for adverse social determinants of health (SDH), medication reconciliation after discharge, communication with the primary care provider, access to a hospital-based transition clinic, and access to a 24-hour direct telephone line staffed by hospital attending pediatricians. These were implemented sequentially from October 2013 to February 2017. The primary outcome was the readmission rate within 30 days of index discharge. The length of stay was a balancing measure. Results: During the intervention, the included services discharged 4,853 children. The pre-implementation readmission rate of 10.3% declined to 7.4% and remained stable during a 4-month post-intervention observation period. Among 1,394 families screened for adverse SDH, 48% reported and received assistance with \u2265 1 concern. The length of stay increased from 4.10 days in 2013 to 4.30 days in 2017. Conclusions: An intervention bundle, including SDH, was associated with a sustained reduction in readmission rates to 2 general pediatric services. Transitional care that addresses multiple domains of family need during a child's health crisis can help reduce pediatric readmissions.",

[1] [2] [3] Nationally, between 7% and 11% of pediatric patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. 4, 5 Reviews by healthcare providers and families suggest 20%-30% of readmissions are preventable. 6, 7 Preventable readmissions are costly 8, 9 and affect the quality of life for patients. 10 Readmissions likely represent a gap in care quality during the previous hospitalization, the transition period, the outpatient follow-up, or some combination of each. 11,12 A more coordinated system of care, including communication, education, and delivery of care in the right setting when needed, may mitigate the medical risk, morbidity, and cost of preventable readmissions. 13 In 2012-2013, North Carolina Children's Hospital readmitted ~10% of children discharged from 2 general pediatrics services within 30 days. The objectives of this project included (1) improving the discharge process for children admitted to our general pediatrics services through a coordinated intervention spanning from the hospital stay through 30 days after discharge, and by doing so (2) reducing the readmission rate on those services by 30%.",

Each general pediatric service includes an attending physician, pediatric residents, and a coordinator (nurse) who addresses family resource and care needs related to hospitalization, such as ordering medical equipment, scheduling follow-up visits, and transportation. Historically, the involvement of the medical team ended at a patient's discharge, leading to gaps in follow-through of medical and resource interventions put in place during hospitalization.

However, the average length of stay increased slightly. Two strengths of this intervention are its implementation at large-scale in a real-world context and the incorporation of social and logistical interventions with traditional medical ones. This project's interventions helped make pediatric discharge a transitional process rather than an event. In particular, 3 initial strategies in the intervention bundle-preparing families for the weeks after discharge, proactive outreach to families after discharge to review the discharge plan, and making attending physicians available by phone to families-coincided with a notable reduction in readmissions. Although these are resource-intensive interventions, they create a continuum of care that guides community reentry and de-escalates care gradually rather than abruptly at discharge. Such investments may not be feasible for all institutions, but the principle of de-escalation rather than abrupt discontinuation is widely generalizable and can be adapted to institutional priorities and resources.",

            "text": "Screening for adverse SDH identified more problems than expected. Of 1,394 families screened, 48% reported at least 1 issue that could affect the health and wellbeing of the child. The transition coordinator provided referrals for all reported issues. However, changes in the average 30-day readmission rate over time were not observed in association with systematic SDH screening and intervention. This finding may be because the screening rate was low (28.7%) or because the time needed to realize health-services-related benefits of mitigating adverse SDH was longer than the 30-day window observed for hospital readmissions. The lack of an observed relationship between addressing adverse SDH and a change in the 30-day readmission rate should not suggest that this particular intervention was ineffective or unimportant. A growing body of evidence highlights the strong relationship between adverse SDH and hospitalization for children, 17, 18 and community-level interventions have reduced use of the hospital and emergency room for children with asthma. 19 Recent publications on pediatric readmissions have focused on their potential preventability 7, [20] [21] [22] or their feasibility and appropriateness as a quality measure. 23, 24 Reviews have found that incorporating multiple components to improve family preparation for discharge, bridge the hospital-to-home transition, and offer ongoing support after discharge were characteristics of interventions that successfully reduced pediatric hospital readmissions. [25] [26] [27] This project incorporated those features, which likely contributed to its effectiveness. Experts in pediatric hospital care have begun to develop standards for pediatric discharge 13 and to include population-level adverse SDH in assessments of hospital readmission performance. 28 Several lessons from this project are worth highlighting. First, medical and social problems are interrelated. For example, a rural family who lacks reliable transportation cannot take a child for important follow-up care. Even with excellent outpatient care available, hospital readmission may occur for that child. Effective assessment of children's medical problems requires attention to social problems. Second, children with both medical and social problems may be at higher risk for readmissions. This transitional intervention targeted the general population of hospitalized children and did not differentiate for those higher-risk groups. Tiering the intervention for high-risk subgroups may be an important future step. Third, hospitalizations offer critical opportunities to address SDH. Many hospitalized patients face adverse SDH that negatively affect health outcomes and likely impact their use of health services. In this project, as the number of reported adverse SDH increased, the chance of 30-day readmission also increased (data not shown). Fourth, community practices play an important role in transitional care. The majority of follow-up visits reported by families took place in community practices. Future efforts need to facilitate an ongoing exchange of information between community providers and hospital providers to maximize the effectiveness of transitional care.",

First, measuring readmissions at the population level of hospitalized children means that the team could not ascertain reasons for individual readmissions. The casemix of patients and reasons for hospitalization may differ from those in other institutions in undetectable ways. However, the population-level approach is also a strength. Including all discharged children and providers on the general pediatric services in this project has led to buy-in and sustainment in the institution. Second, implementation in a real-world context is resource-intensive and limited the ability to implement all intervention components for the duration of the project. In particular, staff capacity limited rates of completed, 3-day follow-up calls (10.9%), and screening for and addressing adverse SDH (28.7%). It may be that low rates of completion obscure any potential effect of these components on readmission rates. Future efforts should include dedicated staff for these time-intensive functions and can be adapted to align with institutional priorities. Third, since components of the intervention were not all implemented for the full duration of the project, it is not possible to ascertain the effects of individual components apart from the whole. Finally, other factors we could not account for could have affected readmission rates. For example, heightened attention to readmissions by policymakers and payers could have led clinicians to invest additional effort to prevent them.",
