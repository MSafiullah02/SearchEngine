It is reported that there might be some mechanisms by which the disease can affect the central nervous system (CNS) (Li et al. 2020). Despite various neurological signs and symptoms, which have been reported (Mao et al. 2020), there are only a few reported cases with documented specific neurological processes to explain the CNS signs (Liu et al. 2020). To our knowledge, no cases of post infectious encephalitis (PIE) and its close follow up have been reported. Herein we report a case with clinical (including respiratory and neurological), laboratory, chest Computed Tomography and Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (B-MRI) findings during evolution and convalescence phase which can illuminate the natural history of similar cases.",

She experienced another episode of GTCS on the same day, managed with increment in levetiracetam dosage (500 mg tid). After improvement of respiratory function, she was extubated (day 15). Despite improvement in inflammatory and metabolic tests, she had a fluctuating level of consciousness. During investigation for decreased level of consciousness, B-MRI revealed T2- fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) high signal intensities in bilateral thalami, medial temporal and pons (figure 2\n). Corresponding areas in T1 images were hypo-signal and without gadolinium enhancement or restriction on T1 post-contrast and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein (19 mg/dl) and glucose (61 mg/dl) levels with no white or red blood cells. PCR tests for detecting viruses including SARS-CoV 2 and herpes simplex virus in CSF were negative. No oligoclonal bands (OCB) was detected. Autoimmune serologic markers including SS-A/SS-B and Anti-phospholipid antibodies were unremarkable. There was a borderline positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA=2.7, positive>1.2) result. Other laboratory tests and their changes during disease course are listed in table 1\n. These results led to the diagnosis of para- infectious encephalitis associated with COVID-19 and treatment with IVIg continued to a total dosage of 3g/kg of body weight (250g total) which resulted in considerable improvement in consciousness, but discontinued because of headaches (day 28). She complained of diplopia and was drowsy, even though the orientation seemed fully recovered (day 28). At this point, we continued the treatment with high dose methylprednisolone (500mg/day) IV for 6 days, after which the diplopia resolved and she regained complete consciousness. Subsequent B-MRIs (figure 2) showed marked resolution of medial temporal and thalami involvements as well as partial improvement in pontine lesions after reinstitution of IVIg (day 22) and administration of methylprednisolone (day 33). Results of SARS-CoV2 serology tests taken during admission became available after discharge and were positive for both IgG and IgM.",

            "text": "Brain involvement during COVID-19 pandemic has been reported in various forms, but the prevalence and proportion of each type of involvement is unknown (Mao et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020). Stroke and encephalitis are specific CNS disorders reported in COVID-19 but there are many reports of neurological findings without obvious pathophysiologic explanations. The most common reported neurological manifestations have been headache, dizziness, encephalopathy and delirium. Some of these patients have been undergone a neurological workup, yet despite reports of CNS symptoms in up to 40% of these patients, there are only few cases where distinct etiology has been discovered (Liu et al. 2020). Among these there is only one established cases of encephalitis with evidence of virus in CNS (Moriguchi et al. 2020) and another case with acute necrotizing encephalitis (ANE) but without evidence for direct viral invasion (Poyiadji et al. 2020). The distribution of cerebral lesions in MRI for our patient was similar to both aforementioned cases but with more extensive and symmetrical involvement of thalami and medial temporal lobes. The involvement of pons has not been present in previous reported cases. Contrary to the ANE case, in our patient there was no evidence for hemorrhage or necrosis in serial B-MRIs. A recent paper has described a number of B-MRI changes in COVID-19 patients, but none of them have been the same as those in our patient (Kandemirl et al. 2020). Although in ANE the authors mentioned treatment with IVIg, but exact dosage, protocol and response to treatment has not been described. Our patient before diagnosis of neurologic involvement had received IVIg (25 g/day for three days) as a part of treatment for COVID-19 severe pulmonary involvement; and after the CNS lesions were established, it was reinstituted and due to very good clinical and radiological response, we decided to continue IVIg therapy until complete recovery, unless there is a complication. After administration of a total 250 g (3 g/kg) IVIg, it was stopped due to occurrence of headaches that seemed related to drug infusion. After discontinuation of IVIg, the headaches resolved completely and due to presence of diplopia and drowsiness treatment was then continued with methylprednisolone (500 mg/day for six days), which led to complete resolution of neurological symptoms. Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was completely asymptomatic. We consider this type of brain involvement, a para- infectious autoimmune encephalitis, as we believe was the case for ANE patient, and recommend prompt immunotherapy upon diagnosis of similar cases. The use of IVIg in severe COVID-19 patients may prevent or ameliorate CNS involvement, as seem to happen for our patient compared to ANE case.",

As for our patient, neurological symptoms not correlated with respiratory and metabolic conditions should be an alarm for the possibility of CNS involvement. Similar to many other viral agents, SARS-CoV 2 seems capable of causing encephalitis. The nature of etiology regarding encephalitis remains the matter of debate as both direct invasion and para-infectious mechanisms seem possible. We recommend prompt assessment of CSF for overt signs of viral infection (marked cellular reaction, increased protein and positive PCR test) and considering immunotherapy with IVIg in cases compatible with para-infectious origin. The usefulness of prophylactic IVIg in severe COVID-19 and the role of serology in CSF for diagnosing neuroinvasion, remain interesting discussions that we are unable to comment about at this moment.",
