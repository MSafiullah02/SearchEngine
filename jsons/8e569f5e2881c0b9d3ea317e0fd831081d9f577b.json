Resulting contigs were compared against the non-152 redundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases on GenBank using Blastn and Blastx, 153 respectively, with an e-value cut-off at 1E-5. Blast search using Blastx was also conducted 154 against a bespoke database containing all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 155 protein reference sequences downloaded from GenBank. Taxonomic information at the domain 156 level (i.e. Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea), as well as for viruses, was first assigned based on the 157 blastn results and then based on blastx results. Potential virus-related sequences were further 158 categorized into families and orders based on their genetic similarity to their closest relatives 159 and/or their phylogenetic position. Similarly, the assignment of viruses to the broader groups of 160 their hosts (i.e. Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea) was based on their phylogenetic relationship to 161 viruses with reliable host information obtained either using experimental or phylogenetic 162 approaches. The genetic identity cut-off for host assignment was set to be 40% based on the 163 most conserved proteins such as RdRp or DNA polymerases [24]. The threshold was set based 164 on the intra-family diversity of most vertebrate-specific virus families/genera [25]. The 165 assignment of vertebrate host was based on phylogenetic analyses, in which a potential devil 166 associated virus is expected to either cluster within, or form a sister group to, the abundance of each transcript/contig, we calculated the percentage of total 170 reads in the library. The abundance of host transcripts/contigs was estimated by mapping reads 171 against Tasmanian devil genome using Bowtie2 [26], whereas those of other organisms, virus, the genome sequence was further extended by merging related contigs. Gaps in 176 the genome were filled either by mapping the reads against the existing scaffold or by RT-PCR 177 and Sanger sequencing. Putative ORFs in viral genomes were predicted by the Geneious 8.1 178 software [28] or NCBI ORF finder, and annotated based on their similarity to of complete or partial genomes and amino acid sequences from the 183 conserved domain (e.g. the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp) of the newly 184 characterised viral sequences were aligned with those of reference viruses representative of the 185 diversity of the corresponding virus family or species. The alignment was performed using the 186 E-INS-I algorithm implemented in MAFFT (version 7) [29]. The quality of the alignments was 187 subsequently assessed, and all ambiguously aligned regions were removed using TrimAl 188 (version 1.2) [30]. Phylogenetic trees of aligned amino acid (all data sets with the exception of 189 RHDV) or nucleotide (RHDV) sequences were then inferred using the maximum likelihood 190 method implemented in PhyML version (3.0) [31], utilising the best-fit substitution model and the 191 Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping algorithmon complete or near complete viral contigs and the percentage of reads 196 mapped to them using Bowtie 2 [26] in each library. QIIME (v 1.9) [32] was used to perform 197 ecological and statistical analysis to compare viromes of different populations. Within-library 10 virotype richness (alpha diversity measured using the Chao1 metric) and dissimilarity between 199 libraries (beta diversity measured using the Euclidean metric) for both VLP metagenomics and 200 meta-transcriptomics were calculated based on levels of viral abundance. The statistical 201 significance of differences in alpha diversity was evaluated by the Monte Carlo method (999 202 permutations), with a null hypothesis that diversity is equal in all libraries with 05. Levels of viral abundance were also used to produce heatmaps and 204 dendrograms from hierarchical clustering. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed 205 on the Euclidean distance matrix as calculated in QIIME, and additional cluster analysis was 206 conducted using K-Means clustering in R [33]. 207 208 PCR confirmation and Sanger sequencing of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) 209 Contigs with high percentage of similarity (>97%) to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) 210 were detected in one of the meta-transcriptomics libraries. RHDV is used as a biocontrol for 211 rabbits in Australia and causes fatal hepatitis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and 212 some hare species [34]. To confirm the detection of RHDV, RT-PCR was performed on 213 individual faecal RNA extractions using the Qiagen OneStep Ahead RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and 214 primers from a previously validated Australian RHDV strain-specific PCR [35] as well as two 215 additional primer sets manually designed based on the current meta-transcriptomics assembled 216 contigs (Additional file 4: Table S4). PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel (Bio-217 Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in 1x tris-acetate EDTA, and visualized using SYBR Safe 218 DNA gel stain (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sanger sequencing of positive PCR 219 products was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (Sydney, Australia). In 220 addition, DNA was extracted from faecal samples using the ISOLATE Fecal DNA kit (Bioline, 221 London, UK) and presence of rabbit DNA was tested using primers targeting a 110 bp region of 222 the Oryctolagus cuniculus 12S mitochondrial rRNA gene (the faecal virome of six pools consisting of a total of 54 faecal samples 232 collected from Tasmanian devils from four wild and two captive sites using both meta-233 transcriptomics and VLP metagenomics approaches. Meta-transcriptomic libraries resulted in 234 128 -140 million reads per pool (793,038,436 reads in total), which were assembled de novo 235 into 196,919 -358,327 contigs (Table 1). Blast analyses of sequence reads from the meta-236 transcriptomic protocol revealed large proportions of reads from Bacteria (55.11 -67.77%), and 237 only 4.32 -7.88% from Eukarya. Mapping reads to the Tasmanian devil genome revealed that 238 10.75 -18.99 % of reads originated from the host. The percentage of reads related to Archaea 239 was less than 0.02%, and for viruses between 0.68 -1.16% (Figure 2a). 240 241 VLP metagenomics resulted in 26 -49 million reads per pool (237,174,236 reads in total), 242 which were assembled de novo into 49,813 -313,354 contigs (Table 1). In comparison to meta-243 transcriptomics, the VLP metagenomics protocol resulted in smaller proportions of non-viral 244 nucleic acids (host and bacterial) and hence enriched viral nucleic acids (Figure 2a).

While the marsupial 402 papillomaviruses viruses are clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, the family Polyomaviridae are small, nonenveloped, circular DNA viruses 406 about 5 kb in size that have been identified in a wide variety of mammalian and avian hosts [39, 407 52]. We detected two novel polymaviruses from the faeces of Tasmanian devils in 3 VLP 408 metagenomics libraries (MI, wMW and Zoo B), which we have tentatively designated Devil 409 polyomavirus 1 and 2 (DePyv1 and -2), respectively. We recovered the complete circular 410 genome of 4894 bp for DePyv1 (Figure 5c) and partial gene sequence (2251 bp) of the large T 411 antigen (LTAg) protein for DePyv2. Phylogenetic analyses revealed strikingly different 412 evolutionary histories for the structural and non-structural parts of the genome (Figure 5c), 413 indicative of recombination [53]. In the LTAg phylogeny, DePyV1 and -2 formed a distinct 414 lineage with another marsupial virus Bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 415 (BPCV-2), which in turn is clustered with polyomaviruses of avian hosts (Figure 5c). In contrast, 416 in the VP1 phylogeny, the marsupial viruses showed no close relationship with the avian 417 viruses. Interestingly, the Bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses (BPCV1 and -2) only 418 showed close relationship to DePyV1 at the LTAg region but not the VP1 region. Indeed, both 419 BPCV1 and -2 are hybrid viruses between the family Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae [54, 420 55]. While its non-structural genes (i.e. large T and small T antigen genes) are related are a large family of DNA viruses with large linear, dsDNA genome of about 120-425 240 kb, and that comprise 3 subfamilies; Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae and 426 Gammaherpesvirinae [39]. In one of the captive VLP metagenomics libraries (Zoo A), we 427 identified more than 70 contigs matching different regions of a herpesvirus genome, which 428 totaled 62,821 bp in length and included partial gene sequences of the DNA polymerase (575 429 aa), major DNA binding protein (465 aa), helicase (396 aa), glycoprotein M (378 aa) and H (427 430 aa), and major capsid protein (358 aa), amongst others. We tentatively named the novel 431 herpesvirus Dasyurid herpesvirus 3 (DaHV-3). Phylogenetic analysis based on these non-432 structural and structural proteins suggested that DaHV-3 clustered with other 433 gammaherpesviruses from the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily (Additional file 5: Figure S1 and 434 Additional file 6: Figure S2). Further analysis of the Gammaherpesvirinae phylogenetic structure 435 based on the DNA polymerase showed that DaHV-3 forms a distinct lineage that is most closely 436 related to Bovine gammaherpesvirus 6 and Common bottlenose dolphin gammaherpesvirus 1 437 strain Sarasota (Figure 5d). The previously characterised Dasyurid herpesvirus 2 (DaHV-2) 438 isolated from Tasmanian devils [12] could not be included in the phylogenetic analysis because 439 there are no available sequences from the same genomic regions. A BLASTx search of the 440 DNA polymerase showed that DaHV-3 exhibited the greatest amino acid similarity (93.3%) with 441 the previously characterised Macropodid herpesvirus 3(MaHV-3) [12], whose DNA polymerase 442 amino acid sequence was also too short (<50% of the other representative herpesviruses) the family Circoviridae have a circular ssDNA genome which range from 1.7 446 to 2.3 kb in size [56]. Here, we identified circovirus-related sequences and recovered the partial 447 20 replicase gene sequences (899 bp) in one of the wild devil metagenomes (SH) and tentatively 448 named it Devil circovirus (DeCV). Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep proteins of the novel 449 DeCV and representative strains of circoviruses and cycloviruses suggested that DeCV is 450 clustered with circoviruses previously isolated from bats and pigs, sharing the highest sequence 451 identity (62%) with bat circovirus (AIF76281.1) (Figure 5e). 452 453 Other viruses: plant and insect viruses, and bacteriophage 454 In both the VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics analyses, large proportions of viral 455 sequence reads could be attributed to viruses that infect plants, insects and bacteria. Indeed, 456 bacteriophage sequences from the order Caudovirales were detected in all libraries and made 457 up over 90% of all viral VLP metagenomic reads and up to 48.91% of the meta-transcriptomic 458 reads. Sequences related to newly identified arthropod viruses, such as Wuhan fly virus and 459 Wuhan mosquito virus were also detected. Most of the insect viruses detected belong to RNA 460 virus groups the Bunyavirales, the Mononegavirales, and the Chuviridae, as well as DNA virus 461 subfamily Densovirinae from the Parvoviridae family. The detection of these arthropod virus 462 related sequences indicates the possible ingestion of arthropods and/or the environmental 463 contamination of faeces. Despite being a carnivorous species, sequences related to various 464 plant and fungal viruses were also observed in all libraries, including various sobemoviruses, 465 tombusviruses and mitoviruses. Herbivorous species such as wallabies often make up a large 466 proportion of devil's diet, and the presence of plant viruses in these prey items might be easily 467 detected in the faeces of devil through deep sequencing, especially if the intestines of the prey 468 were consumed [1]. Nonetheless, devils have also been observed to consume vegetation, and 469 the abundance of highly diverse eukaryotic and vertebrate viruses that are thought to be 470 associated with diverse host taxa are reflective of devils' overall generalist diet [had lower diversity in their faecal viromes compared to wild populations, as 476 measured using the chao1 metric. However, when considering bacteriophage alone, we did not 477 find any significant associations between devil populations (captive or wild) in either diversity -transcriptomics analysis of the virome of Maria Island (MI) devils displayed a similar 481 level of overall viral diversity to the two captive populations (Zoo A and Zoo B), and was lower 482 than that found in the three other wild populations (wMW, BR and SH) (Figure 6a). Conversely, 483 alpha diversity as characterized from VLP metagenomics data did not differ significantly 484 between libraries (Figure 6b). Cluster analysis indicated that in the meta-transcriptomics data, 485 wild and captive devils fell into two distinct clusters, while in VLP metagenomics data, BR 486 formed its own cluster and the remaining populations formed a second cluster (Figure 6a and 487 b",

            "text": "term relationship between viruses and hosts are expected for mammalian viruses [25]. 605 Strong evidence for this lies in the observation that devil viruses are usually clustered with other 606 marsupial viruses, as a marsupial-specific lineage that is distinct from the eutherian viruses, as 607 observed in papillomavirus [78, 79], polyomavirus, and herpesvirus (Fig. 5). Furthermore, in 608 several cases the branching order of viruses broadly reflects that of their hosts such that a 609 general co-divergence can be inferred. For instance, in the phylogenies of Picornaviridae and 610 Astroviridae, the devil (marsupial) viruses formed sister clade to eutherian viruses, which in turn 611 are sister to avian viruses, consistent with the evolutionary history of the host. Although such a 612 relationship is not observed in every virus phylogeny, a deep divergence between eutherian and 613 marsupial viruses is typical of our dataset. This observation indicates that the timescale of virus 614 evolution is very likely to reflect that of the hosts [25]. 615 616 The gut virome is increasingly recognized as an integral component of the gut microbiome, and 617 studies of the devil virome will continue to shine light on the biology and health of this iconic 618 endangered species. For example, bacteriophage, which we have shown to dominate the devil's 619 faecal virome, can contribute to host health by maintaining the diversity and structure of the gut 620 bacteriome through direct interactions with the bacterial communities. While the functions of 621 bacteriophage on devil health remain to be determined, future studies will be able to exploit the 622 extensive microbiomic data that is now available to answer important questions about the host-623 microbe relationship between devils and their microbiome [in their faecal viromes compared to wild devils, likely reflective of their captive 630 diets and lifestyle. Identification of vertebrate and marsupial-specific viruses in devils provides 631 potential candidate viruses for future disease surveillance and routine screening as part of the 632 broader conservation management of devils. However, future work will first need to focus on 633 elucidating the pathogenic impact of these viruses on devil health. Finally, we showed that a 634 combination of VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics may be a more comprehensive 635 virome characterisation approach that will encompass both DNA and RNA viruses.

            "text": "increased the number of viral reads in each library compared to the meta-transcriptomic 510 approach. However, the viral compositions of all six VLP metagenomes were highly skewed 511 towards DNA viruses, particularly DNA bacteriophage from the order Caudovirales. This is 512 consistent with a previous study comparing various enrichment methods, in which 513 bacteriophage accounted for >80% of all reads in all of the enrichment methods tested, but <5% 514 when no enrichment steps were incorporated[58]. Despite being able to substantially increase 515 the total number of viral reads in the metagenomes, sequence-independent amplification is bias 516 prone, resulting in fewer viruses being detected and lower genome coverage due to preferential 517 amplification of certain sequences[59][60][61]. However, the over-representation of bacteriophage 518 found here could also be attributed to the fact that they make up the bulk of the virobiota in the 519 gut, which is dominated by bacteria[62, 63]. Regardless of its known bias[58, 59], VLP 520 metagenomics still holds merit for use in virome characterisation due to its ability to identify low 521 abundance DNA viruses, which is especially relevant for dormant or non-active viruses.Compared to VLP metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics is non-viral specific, requires less 524 sample processing, and reveals the entire transcriptome within a sample[20, 64]. Omitting the 525 need for VLP enrichment and additional sample processing, the likelihood of biased detection is 526 plausibly reduced in meta-transcriptomics. In this study, the proportions of viral reads 527 sequenced by meta-transcriptomics were less than 2% per library, but the numbers of viral Importantly, then, our results show that the taxonomic compositions of viral communities as 532 revealed by VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics were not interchangeable and neither 533 of the approaches was able to detect all viruses present. However, these two approaches were 534 complementary to one-another, and an integrated approach using both VLP metagenomics and 535 meta-transcriptomics will prove to be a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both 536 the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities in a sample.Ecological analysis of virome composition and diversity revealed significant differences between 539 captive and wild devil populations, especially when characterised using meta-transcriptomics.The two captive populations displayed lower levels of viral diversity compared to the four wild 541 populations. This loss of diversity within the captive populations is consistent with trends 542 previously observed in the gut bacteriome, where captive devils also exhibited lower bacterial 543 diversity compared to wild devils [65]. The microbiome is dynamic and sensitive to changes in 544 the environment. Hence, the extreme lifestyle and diet changes that often occur in captivity are 545 likely to affect the viral communities of devils. Interestingly, Maria Island devils had viromes that 546 are more similar to the two captive populations. Maria Island is a 115 km 2 island off the east 547 coast of Tasmania (Fig 1) and is home to approximately 100 free ranging devils. There were no 548 Tasmanian devils living on Maria Island until 27 devils were introduced to the island in 2012 and 549 24 2013 from several captive populations [66]. Non-native vertebrate species, such as cats, black 550 rats and house mice, are present on the island, whilst other species such as rabbits and 551 livestock are absent, although all these species are common in the wild on mainland Tasmania. Two factors may have potentially contributed to the lower viral diversity observed on Maria 553Island. First, due to its isolation from mainland Tasmania, animal movements or immigrations 554 are limited to only marine or bird species. This restriction to animal movements (particularly 555 vertebrate species) between the mainland and Maria Island may in turn limit the introduction of 556 viruses to the island. Second, captive-born devils are likely to have a \"captive-type\" virome, that 557 is, lower viral diversity compared to wild devils. Indeed, some of the devils included in this study 558 are captive-born animals recently translocated to the island. As samples were pooled prior to 559 sequencing, it was not possible to distinguish between viromes of captive-born and wild-born 560 devils. To understand whether captive devils can reacquire a \"wild-type\" virome following 561 translocations, future studies should focus on comparing captive born translocated devils with Overall, we detected sequences related to 20 vertebrate viruses, including 18 novel marsupial 565 related viruses and two known mammalian viruses (RHDV2 and torovirus). While some of the 566 viruses identified in this study come from families that include important pathogens, their 567 pathogenic potential in devils is unclear. It is also important to note that some of these viruses 568 may in fact be dietary viruses or occur naturally as part of the normal gut flora and therefore do 569 not necessarily lead to disease. In the case of RHDV, we showed that RHDV2 was present in 570 both captive and wild devils. In some areas of Tasmania, rabbits are common and may be a 571 dietary component of wild devils. They are also regularly fed to devils in captivity, along with 572 other meat sources such as wallaby and chicken. Feeding records provided by the two zoos in 573 this study confirmed the feeding of rabbits to some of the sampled devils (zoo A) around the 574 time of faecal collection. While we did not detect rabbit genes by meta-transcriptomics, VLP 575 25 metagenomics or PCR in any of the wild devil samples that tested positive for RHDV, we did 576 detect rabbit mtDNA in the stools of one captive devil from zoo A that tested positive for RHDV 577 by PCR. Thus, more specific diagnostic techniques such as targeted PCR of blood or internal 578 tissues (i.e. liver), in situ hybridization and serological assays are required to determine whether 579 these viruses can actively replicate in devils and cause disease or are simply gut contaminants.Nevertheless, exposure to host-adapted viruses could pose significant health threats, especially 581 for devils that are immunocompromised due to DFTD, old age or other concurrent diseases [67,582 68]. Furthermore, even commensal or latent viral infections can be exacerbated or reactivated in 583 immunocompromised hosts [69, 70]. For example, in the giant panda, while a number of viruses 584 (e.g. papillomaviruses, picornaviruses and anelloviruses) were detected in both sick and healthy 585 animals, the virus titres were much higher in the diseased individuals, indicating a compromised 586 balance between host immune response and virus replication [71]. Tasmanian devils have low genetic diversity both across their genomes and at functionally 589 important loci such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [72-74]. This lack of diversity 590 renders them particularly vulnerable to changes in the environment, including the emergence of 591 new pathogens [75]. For instance, populations of Italian agile frogs with lower microsatellite 592 diversity have been shown to be more susceptible to an emerging strain of Ranavirus (FV3-frog 593 virus 3) and experience higher mortality rates than populations with higher diversity [76].Similarly in cheetahs, a coronavirus-associated feline infectious peritonitis outbreak causing 595 mass mortality in a captive breeding colony was linked to the species' extreme genetic 596 monomorphism, particularly at the MHC[77]. While none of the devils included in this study 597 exhibited overt signs of disease at the time of sample collection, the viruses described here will 598 provide a fundamental baseline of the normal Tasmanian devil faecal virome, which can be 599 used as a reference for comparing healthy and diseased animals.",
