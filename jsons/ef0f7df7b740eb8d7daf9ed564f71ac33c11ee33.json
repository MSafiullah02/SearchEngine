Evidence in China suggests that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may be less severe in children and thus harder to recognize [5, 6] . Possible explanations could be: 1) children might have fewer opportunities for exposure to pathogens or infected patients [5] , 2) lower expression of the Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE 2) receptor as it is indicated that ACE 2 is likely the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [7] , 3) children often get respiratory infections (including Coronaviruses) in the winter and might therefore have higher antibody levels than adults [5] , 4) the immune system of children is still developing and may react differently on pathogens compared to adults' immune system [8] .The lower symptomatic disease incidence in the pediatric population raises the concern that this population could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [6] .",

            "text": "The result is in line though with other studies that suggest only a minimal role of children in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. Iceland reported children under 10 years of age less likely to be positive by RT-PCR testing than were persons 10 years of age or older in large scale screening in a random sample of the general population (n=13080 of whom 848 children were all negative vs. 0.8% positives in the remaining sample) [11] . Similarly, in Italy no children younger than 10 were infected in a large-scale survey before and after the start of the lock-down in the municipality where the first COVID-19 death in Italy was reported [12] . Among confirmed COVID-19 patients, the percentage of children was as low as 1-5% in studies published up to March 18 2020, and in United states up to April 10, [13, 14] . Although children in China had a similar risk of infection as adults [15] , China reported a lower secondary attack rate to children than to adults (4% vs 17%) in a household study [16] . Only a handful of deaths among children with COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and generally symptoms in children are mild [17] Limited evidence from contact research suggests that children less frequently infect other people than do adults, although similar viral loads as in adults were observed in an unpublished German study [18] .",

A recent review found only 9.7% pediatric index cases among 31 intra-household transmission clusters identified from literature [20] . Our study adds that in Belgium, where the epidemic was imported mainly by adult travelers, there is no sign of early introduction into daycare centers at a moment children were not yet isolated at home although the virus was clearly circulating. It is clear that more evidence is needed to understand the actual role of young children in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and their infection risk when attending daycare.",

This collection period spanned the crucial first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium, thus enabling us to study the introduction, if any, of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the daycare population. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 carriage, NP swabs taken from 84 children attending 8 different daycare centers (1 in Brussels, 3 in Wallonia and 4 in Flanders) during the period of 2-12 March 2020 were analyzed. Of the 84 children included in this study, relevant population characteristics were: 1) 43 (52.4%) were girls; 2) at the moment of sampling, signs of common cold were observed in half of the children (51.2%); 3) just over half (56.1%) of the children had at least one sibling in the same household; 4) the majority of children (87.8%) stayed at least twice a week in daycare; and 5) the parents of the majority of the children (75.6%) were non-smokers.",
