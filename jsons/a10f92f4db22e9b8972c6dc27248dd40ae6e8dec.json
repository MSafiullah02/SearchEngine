The metropolitan area of Milan and its surrounding region of the Lombardy are one of the worst affected in Italy, and Europe at the moment. As of 29 March 2020, there have been 97 689 cases with 10 779 fatalities due to COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in whole of Italy; of these, 41 007 (6360 fatalities) have occurred in Lombardy region [2] . In order to slow down viral transmission, local authorities and the Italian government have imposed strong containment measures by quarantining initial COVID-19 clusters and followed by a complete nationwide lock-down. The exponential increase in COVID-19-positive patients and the dramatically increasing need for intensive care unit (ICU) surge capacity for the management of critically ill patients has led the emergency task force of the Lombardy region to reallocate ICU resources [3] . In addition, elective surgery has been cancelled and beds dedicated to cardiac, neurosurgery and partially coronary care units reassigned to COVID-19-patients. For this reason, 16 of the 20 cardiac surgical units in the Lombardy region have discontinued their activities, with the remaining 4 units forming 'the hub' for the 16 other closed units (spokes). In this hub-and-spoke system, all urgent and emergency cases are sent to these 4 units, including those that cannot be delayed for more than 60 days. Moreover, beds for critically ill patients are also obtained from the reconversion of operation and recovery rooms (A. Parolari, personal communication).",

However during this transitional phase, patients recovering from an operation in the hospital should be safely managed. Moreover, patients with a regular postoperative course should be discharged as quickly as possible and managed with out-patient care as soon as their physical condition allows. However, some patients with a complicated postoperative course requiring prolonged ICU hospitalization, on different modes of support [intra aortic balloon pump (IABP), continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy] are neither dischargeable nor transferrable into other ICUs. It should be noted that these kinds of patients have a very dismal prognosis, should they ultimately be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, it is reasonable to reserve 3-4 ICU beds, in a separate area of the hospital without any contact with the COVID-19 zone, which is dedicated to the management of chronically ill patients, already in hospital before the quarantine. Some OR facilities, that are shut down in such a situation, could be dedicated to this 'Chronic ICU', and progressively converted to available ICU beds when chronically ill cardiac patients recover, or die. As the vast majority of anaesthesiologists are involved in COVID-19 patients, cardiac surgeons should be involved in ward and chronic ICU management during this transitional phase.",

These patients, according to the severity of wound dehiscence and sternal stability, should be switched to oral antibiotics and managed with long-acting wound therapy (such as vacuum-assisted therapy) at home, if possible [7] . It is also possible that recently discharged patients develop moderate wound problems, such that they could require outpatient evaluation and medication. During quarantine, movements are extremely limited, so outpatient evaluation can become an issue. Cardiac surgeons should follow-up with these patients via telephone interview and photographic assessment (via email or mobile phone). Patients with mild wound problems should be encouraged to stay at home and provide self-care of the wound with simple betadine rinsing and sterile dressing. Only more severe cases should be evaluated in the hospital, if possible within a dedicated pathway in order to minimize any risk of viral transmission.",

Cardiac surgeon could evaluate the most recent exams by mail, and reassure the patient, after a phone interview, that his postoperative course is uneventful. Furthermore, the surgeon should re-evaluate patients scheduled for surgery before the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients in need of urgent surgery should be referred to a cardiac hub hospital. Operations for patients with stable cardiac disease should be postponed and cardiac surgeon should reassure his patients that they are not taking any risk in delaying surgery.

As the number of infected patients increases exponentially, and more hospital beds are dedicated to COVID-19 patients, all available physicians (exempted from elective activities) and resources should be involved in managing the emergency. It should be noted that a certain number of exposed physicians will become infected, such that the global healthcare system progressively can become inadequate. As anaesthesiologists, pneumologists and intensivists are the front-line in managing these patients, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons can contribute more than other specialties for several reasons. First, in many centres, surgeons are used to managing ICU patients. Secondly, surgeons are used to chest imaging (X-ray, lung echo and CT scan), to blood gas analysis and to circulatory evaluation and support, if needed. Even if they might not be so versed in airway management (including intubation and tracheostomy), they are able to obtain percutaneous arterial and venous access, that are useful both for monitoring and support. Finally, although the most dramatic consequence of a COVID-19 infection is severe respiratory failure, there is some evidence of acute and chronic cardiac involvement [8] . In patients with COVID-19 infection and severe symptoms, up to 30% presented with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in Wuhan, myocardial injury associated with the SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed, and among the people who died from COVID-19, 11.8% of patients had substantial heart damage, with elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest during hospitalization [9] . Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, the incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders arising during disease progression, and can be significantly worsened by respiratory failure-related hypoxia. From this viewpoint, cardiac management of these patients (including fluid management and inotropes) requires skills that commonly belong to members of the cardiac surgery community. The last aspect in which cardiac surgeon can significantly contribute to is mechanical respiratory and circulatory support. The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the management of COVID-19 is unclear at this point [10] . It has been used in some patients with COVID-19 in China but detailed information is unavailable. Moreover, much about the virus is unknown, including the natural history, incidence of late complications, viral persistence and the prognoses in different subsets of patients. To address this, prompt mobilization of existing registries and clinical research groups (for example, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry) should help facilitate the systematic collection of data.",

The Authors examined a scenario in which criteria for admission to the ICU may be solely based on the principle of distributive justice. Hence, the ethical principle guiding the intensivists in a resource-limited healthcare system should be to allocate resources to those with a greater life expectancy rather than on a first-come, first-serve basis. A second approach could be giving priority to those who are sickest and therefore in greatest need. During the system of triage established in the Napoleonic army, for instance, soldiers who were 'dangerously wounded' received care before the less severely wounded. The dying were left untreated [12] .",

We have described the model that is being implemented at the moment in the Lombardy region, the region with (as of 29 March 2020) 42% of cases and 59% of fatalities (of note, Lombardy region has a population of 10.04 million, which accounts for 16.6% of the total Italian population of 60.48 million). This model foresees an hub-and-spoke model, but it is possible that, in the near future, different models may be adopted by other regions; at the moment Veneto, another region hard hit by COVID-19, is considering concentrating all its cardiac surgical cases that are COVID-negative in only a single hospital and reassigning all other units to the treatment of COVID-19 patients until the end of the emergency status (G.
