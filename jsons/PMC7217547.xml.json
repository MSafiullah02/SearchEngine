            "text": "The modeling and analysis of epidemic spreading lie at the core of our understanding about the unfolding of dynamical processes in complex networks, such as malware spreading and information dissemination. In spite of the major advances in this area, one common assumption has been employed that considers a time separation between the evolution in network structures and the contagion process, which limits the spreading process to be typically considered on static networks or annealed networks [1\u20133]. As the latest empirical studies showed that the contagion of many infectious diseases and the evolution of network structure have a comparable time scale [4,5], the theoretical analysis of these contagion processes requires the development of a novel analytical framework. Correspondingly, an activity-driven approach has been recently put forward for an explicit representation of time-varying connectivity patterns [6]. Under the framework of activity-driven networks (ADNs), the epidemic models incorporating other network characteristics have been proposed by adapting the generative rules of ADNs, such as the community structure [7\u20139] and the metapopulation model [10], the lifetimes of links [11] and weak/strong ties [12,13], the node's attractiveness [14,15] and the mutual selection [16].",

However, in the real world, individuals are in the position to be aware of the potential threat of disease and they would behave accordingly. Remarkably, risk perception of infectious disease has been acknowledged as an indispensable ingredient for accurate modeling of epidemic spreading process on static networks [17]. In this context, the awareness is reflected in the contact behavior that would change the connection patterns [18,19], or the preventive measures that would modify the propagation parameters [20,21]. Inspired by them, there is an impelling need to include the individual's behavior for depicting contagion processes on the ADNs. Among the limited works in this direction, authors in Ref. [22] investigated the effect of human behavioral adaptations by assuming that the activity level of individuals would be reduced based on their own states and global awareness effect. Such an activity reduction is also considered in Ref. [23], with the risk perception embodied in a function of the global prevalence or the growth rate of infection. In addition to the reduction of activity level in contact behavior, the preventive behaviors that would decrease the risk of infection without disrupting the connection patterns is considered in a recent study [24].",

A more practical phenomenon is that the preventive behavior is adopted once the individual's risk awareness reaches or exceeds a critical value [26,27]. In this case, the effect of awareness is embodied in the adoption of self-protecting behavior, which could then be better described by a threshold model [28]. Particularly, the threshold model has gained prominence in characterizing complex contagion phenomenons in which multiple sources of exposure are required for the adoption [29], such as the spread of fads and ideas over static networks [30,31] and temporal networks [32,33]. To the best of our knowledge, the risk perception characterized by a decision-making threshold has not been included in previous studies under the framework of ADNs yet.",

The herd behavior that people would like to follow those who take precautionary measures to protect themselves has been observed to be one of the most common social behaviors, and has recently attracted substantial attentions from the research field [34\u201336]. In this way, the risk awareness of infection diffuses among the susceptible population and consequentially influences their decision making processes. Or rather, the number of alert neighbors in the local epidemic situation has a profound impact on suppressing epidemic explosion. Nevertheless, the spread of awareness is rarely considered in the contagion process on ADNs, and its modeling and analysis are still challenging as a consequence of the incessantly evolving interaction patterns.",

The threshold is defined as a critical value beyond which individuals would take self-protecting measures and thus gain a lower risk of infection. Specifically, in order to circumvent the limit of node's inactivity in ADNs under which the instantaneous neighbors of an inactive node might be too few to make a decision, we only consider the absolute threshold model throughout the paper, which means the risk perception is based on the absolute number of the infectious or alert neighbors. An analytically tractable epidemic model in the ADNs is formulated that explicitly incorporates the typical susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading with the awareness diffusion characterized by the threshold model. The effects of risk perception and awareness diffusion on the epidemic threshold are investigated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. It is found that the number of alert neighbors in local epidemic situation and the duration of preventive effect are critical for restraining epidemic outbreak: (i) If the risk perception is only based on the number of infectious neighbors, the epidemic threshold remains unchanged when the preventive effect is not sustainable, which will be increased with the permanent effect. (ii) When the number of alert neighbors are considered in the risk perception, the epidemic threshold will be enhanced with the rapid awareness diffusion.",

Thus, all nodes with the same activity belong to the same class and are considered statistically equivalent. At each time step t, the inactive nodes have the possibility to be passively connected by the active nodes. Given the activity potential distribution F(a) and the definition of m, it is expected that maN edges exist in Gt, where a=\u2211aaF(a).

Obviously, F(a,a\u2032) equals to the ratio of the number of edges between nodes with activity a and nodes with activity a\u2032, to the number of edges in Gt.

Since the threshold model adopted for awareness diffusion might trigger different types of awareness diffusion process, it is an intricate task to deal with the epidemic threshold problem for general cases of ca and da with the SAIS model given in (21)\u2013(22). The following analysis is proceeded under the assumption of \u03c6aS,t>0 that implies the possibility of preventive behavior adoption when t\u2192\u221e. This assumption could be held with a reasonable combination of the infection and alert thresholds, such as ca=1,da=1. In the later analysis of numerical simulation, it is observed that under the given topological parameters of the ADN, this assumption could be applied to a number of other cases with more conservative threshold conditions. Here, we provide a general analysis for these cases in which the value of \u03c6aS,t is dependent on the ca and da. Under this assumption, the steady state of the SAIS model in (21)\u2013(22) is satisfied with\n(40)Iat=\u03bb~(maIt+m\u03b8I)\u03bb(maIt+m\u03b8I)+\u03c6aS,t\u03bc\u03bb~(maIt+m\u03b8I)+\u03c6aS,t+\u03bb~(maIt+m\u03b8I)\u03bb(maIt+m\u03b8I)+\u03c6aS,t,when t\u2192\u221e.

While the infectious neighbors are necessary for starting the process of awareness diffusion, the results in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the information of alert neighbors is important for raising the epidemic threshold and reducing infection prevalence. Furthermore, there are also some interesting phenomena revealed by our model.

From Figs. 6(a) and 6(c), it can be seen that the abrupt transition (from a positive value to 0) of I\u221e is exactly accompanied by the abrupt jumping of A\u221e from 0 to a positive value close to 1. The infection rate where the transition occurs is defined as our critical infection rate \u03bb*. Then it is observed that when \u03bb<\u03bb*, the final fraction of alert nodes A\u221e is approximate to 0, which means that the awareness diffusion is limited. Consequently, I\u221e with Ta=2 is almost the same to that with a larger Ta as shown in Fig. 5(d). For \u03bb close to but greater than \u03bb*, A\u221e is approximate to 0.9583 and thus the cascade of awareness on the network could be expected. Since the alert nodes have a reduced infection risk by taking self-protecting measures, the epidemic spreading process is suppressed and finally disappears on the network. Such cascade effects are dominated in the coupled dynamical process of infection and awareness for a larger \u03bb until the condition in the Eq. (41) is met, where the disease contagion breaks out in spite of the preventive measures. In Fig. 6(c), A\u221e decays continuously from \u03bb=0.25 that is close to the epidemic threshold given by \u03bb(\u03bb~)/\u03bc=0.2568(0.1284). Then, I\u221e increases continuously as shown in Fig. 6(a). It is of significant interest to understand the dynamical process of the propagation system near the transition, i.e., when \u03bb is very close to \u03bb*. In Figs. 6(b) and 6(d), we recored the time evolution of It and At, respectively. It is observed that with a slight increase of \u03bb close to \u03bb*, It increases gradually over a period of time from t=0, then it decreases to 0 with time. In the meanwhile, At increases with the slightly increasing of \u03bb and then it arrives at a stable value with time. In addition, it can be seen that the decrease of It and also the increase of At are rather abrupt, and the time of this abrupt change is advanced with a larger \u03bb. Note that during a period of time from t=0, both the It and At are increased with \u03bb. According to the threshold model of awareness diffusion in our SAIS model, a certain proportion of infected nodes is the indispensable ingredient for triggering the cascade of awareness. Thus the results of Figs. 6(b) and 6(d) might provide an explanation for the abrupt first-order transition in the system: when \u03bb<\u03bb*, the awareness diffusion is impeded and the outbreak of disease contagion occurs. For \u03bb>\u03bb*, the larger infection prevalence in the initial period promotes the diffusion of awareness, which on the contrary, suppresses the epidemic spreading process instead. While \u03bb is large enough to surmount the effect of preventive measures, the disease contagion certainly breaks out.\n",

In Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), the final fraction of infected nodes with different alert thresholds are almost identical to each other under the given infection rate. According to the theoretical analysis in Sec. III B, the epidemic threshold is only dependent on the infection rate \u03bb~ under the assumption \u03c6aS(t)>0. As shown in Fig. 7, this assumption is held with Ti=1,2 for Ta from 1 to 6, and the epidemic thresholds suggested by the Monte Carlo simulations as well as the SAIS model are close to the theoretical one. In addition, the abrupt first-order transition of I\u221e is also observed under a variety of threshold conditions in Figs. 7(c)\u20137(f), such as Ti=3,Ta=6 in Fig. 7(c) and Ti=4,Ta=4 in Fig. 7(d). Similar analysis of the dynamical process near these transitions indicates that the effect of awareness diffusion with h=\u221e presents a similar two-stage characteristic as shown in Fig. 5. That is, there exists a critical infection rate \u03bb*>1m(a+a2), below which the awareness diffusion is limited and the disease contagion outbreaks on the networks. On the contrary, a slight increase of \u03bb=\u03bb* will trigger the cascade of awareness and suppress the epidemic spreading instead. These cases are reminiscent of the real-world phenomena where a virus that may not be highly contagious would, instead, persist for a long time.\n",

            "text": "Furthermore, we investigate the effects of time-varying network structure affected by awareness diffusion on disease contagion. Under the framework of ADNs and inspired by the previous works [22,23], we introduce the time-varying activity of alert nodes in the coupled dynamical process of infection and awareness. The joint effect of preventive behavior adoption and activity reduction on suppressing the disease contagion will be studied. Specifically, we assume that the alert node with activity a will reduce its activity to a~=\u03b3a with \u03b3\u22641 until it leaves the alert state. Four candidates of \u03b3 are employed in the simulations, which are 0.25,0.5,0.75 and 1. Since we have set m=6, we consider three cases of threshold conditions with Ti+Ta=6. The final fraction of infected nodes with time-varying activity is presented in Fig. 8. From Figs. 8(a) to 8(c) with duration h=1, we find a nontrivial interaction among the epidemic spreading, the awareness diffusion and the time-varying network structure. In Fig. 8(a), the final fraction of infected nodes I\u221e with \u03b3=1 is lower than other three candidates of \u03b3 for \u03bb\u2208[0.17,0.25], suggesting that a reduced activity is not always beneficial to restrain epidemic spreading. This result is understandable in view of the significant role of alert nodes in awareness diffusion. Under the proposed SAIS model, the activity reduction of alert nodes delivers two opposite effects: it reduces the infection risk of alert nodes but also hampers the diffusion of awareness. When h=1, the effect of preventive measures is determined by the recent risk perception, and thus the alert nodes may fail to keep alert and thereby decelerate the awareness diffusion over the whole networks. In Fig. 8(b), I\u221e seems not to be affected by the time-varying activity of alert nodes due to the localized awareness diffusion shown in Fig. 5(c). In Fig. 8(c), the curves of I\u221e with \u03b3=0.25 and 0.5 are obviously higher than that with \u03b3=1, thus a reduced activity related to \u03b3=0.25 and 0.5 would be detrimental for controlling the disease contagion. Nevertheless, I\u221e with \u03b3=0.75 is decreased compared with \u03b3=1 for \u03bb<0.31. Thus it can be concluded that there is an optimal \u03b3 for balancing these two opposite effects. Figs. 8(d)\u20138(f) are related to h=\u221e where the effect of preventive behavior is permanent. For the three cases of threshold conditions, it is observed that compared with \u03b3=1, the reduction of activity has the potential to enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the infection prevalence. Although the reduced activity of alert nodes leads to fewer susceptible-alert (S-A) connections, the alert nodes are benefited with a lower infection risk whilst remaining alert due to h=\u221e, which then facilitates awareness diffusion on the networks.\n",

The risk perception is based not only on the instantaneous number of infectious neighbors, but also that of the alert neighbors. Leveraging the mean-field approximation, an SAIS model is developed incorporating the SIS disease contagion process with the awareness diffusion process characterized by a threshold. Based on the proposed model, it is shown that the information of the number of alert neighbors for risk perception and a longer duration of the preventive effect are beneficial for enhancing the epidemic threshold and reducing the infection prevalence. In addition, it can be observed from simulation that there exists a critical infection rate for triggering the cascade of awareness, which induces a two-stage characteristic for the infection prevalence. Furthermore, due to the two opposite effects embedded in the reduction in the activity of alert individuals, the interaction among the epidemic spreading, the awareness diffusion and the time-varying network structure is nontrivial.",

Our work extends the SAIS model considered in static networks to the more accurate but demanding temporal networks. The threshold model that is more suitable for characterizing the adoption of preventive behaviors is introduced in the risk perception. Our findings unveil the important role of awareness diffusion driven by the alert individuals in temporal networks and the impact of the duration of the preventive effect. In this paper, we have considered that the awareness diffusion and epidemic spreading occur on the same network. Meanwhile, the risk perception is considered only with the information of the current epidemic situation. Therefore, the propagation of awareness and epidemic on different networks, as well as the role of historical epidemic information deserve further study in the future.",
