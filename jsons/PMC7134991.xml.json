            "text": "In The Lancet, Matthew Cotten and colleagues8 further describe the geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV infections across time in Saudi Arabia. This study represents the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes described so far, with 13 complete and eight partial genomes (30\u201395% genome coverage) from 21 clinical MERS samples taken from the Al-Hasa outbreak and four other sites in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Buraidah, Bisha, and Hafr-Al-Batin). Each of the sequences was derived directly from clinical specimens of patients and thus avoided any mutations that would be introduced by tissue culture passage. The authors report three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes, whereas phylogeographic analyses suggest that the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically dispersed. Furthermore, genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have been caused by more than one virus introduction. The data obtained from clinical MERS samples from the Al-Hasa cluster and community outbreaks has recorded evolution of the MERS-CoV virus in this epidemic within Saudi Arabia, and the sequence variations also reveal remarkable multiple-tree clusters. The study has provided interesting data supporting circulation of MERS-CoV since the middle of 2011, with the estimated tMRCA as July, 2011 (95% HPD July, 2007 to June, 2012).8\n",

Disease transmission patterns in the epidemic suggest both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events. The current genome sequence set is not adequate to discriminate definitively between single or multiple zoonotic introductions, but the description of the pair of related genomes from Riyadh and Bisha and the description of cases in east and west Saudi Arabia in both major lineages of the tree suggest many zoonotic events. Overall, this is an interesting study that extends earlier findings.2, 3 Although this report provides neither direct evidence of animal transmission nor the precise mechanism of transmission, the information is useful in tracing the source and transmission of MERS-CoV.8\n",

            "text": "There are some examples of the historical role and scientific value of molecular methods in tracing emerging severe acute respiratory infections. After the major outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2003, researchers in many countries had applied molecular genome analysis to track the viral evolution and spread of the disease.9, 10, 11 PCR has provided the scientific basis for direct examination of clinical samples for evidence of infection. Similar to MERS-CoV, sequence variations were reported in SARS-CoV obtained from different patients in this epidemic.9, 10, 11 Cotten and colleagues8 have effectively shown that sequence variations in the MERS-CoV genome can be applied as a powerful molecular method in tracing the route of transmission, when used in conjunction with standard epidemiology. Furthermore, using the publicly released full genomic sequences of SARS-CoV in 2003, various molecular detection methods based on RT-PCR were developed. Most of the diagnostic assays were initially focused on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools, but assays based on the analysis of RNA extracted from plasma and serum were later developed.12, 13 Such blood RNA assays (with one targeted at the nucleocapsid region and the other the polymerase region of the virus genome) allowed the more standardised quantitative expression of viral loads and became useful for early SARS diagnosis, with a detection rate of up to 80% during the first week of illness, when serology diagnosis of SARS was not sensitive at the early stage.12, 13 These quantitative systems, if available, might be useful for the early diagnosis of MERS-CoV and can provide viral load information that might facilitate prognostic assessments of an infected individual.",
