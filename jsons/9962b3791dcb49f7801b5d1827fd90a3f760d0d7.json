People with diabetes and COVID-19 may need special attention and clinical care [3] . In the absence of any known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a \"publichealth emergency\", many drugs have been tried recently in the treatment for COVID-19 that includes a low-cost antimalarial drug chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), along with several other antiviral drugs. Because HCQ has been approved in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in India since 2014 as a third-or fourth-line drug, it would be interesting to research its impact in patients with diabetes, infected with COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 314, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 531, "end": 534, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Reports gathered so far have suggested that a number of drugs could be potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, although the clinical effectiveness of these drugs have not yet been fully evaluated.

It is also believed that chloroquine may have a varied mechanism of action which may differ depending upon the pathogen studied. It has been increasingly learnt that the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of chloroquine may have a role in the treatment of patients with novel COVID-19. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and thereby it has the potential to block viral infection [7] . In addition, chloroquine also inhibits the quinone reductase-2, which is involved in sialic acid biosynthesis (an acidic monosaccharides of cell transmembrane proteins required for ligand recognition) that makes this agent a broad antiviral agent. It is important to note that both human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and orthomyxoviruses uses sialic acid moieties as a receptor. Moreover, chloroquine changes the pH of lysosomes and likely inhibits cathepsins, that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, chloroquine through the inhibition of MAP-kinase interferes with SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk, besides altering the virion assembly, budding and interfering with the proteolytic processing of the M protein [7, 8] . Previous experimental studies have also demonstrated that chloroquine has potent anti-SARS-CoV-1 effects in vitro, primarily attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation receptors at the virus cell surface, so that it cannot bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine. Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the similar surface receptor ACE2, it is believed that chloroquine can also interfere with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus prevents SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the target cells [6e9]. Chinese researchers who studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro (using Vero E6 cell line infected by SARS-CoV-2) found chloroquine to be highly effective in reducing viral replication that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favorable penetration in tissues including the lung [6, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1444, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1447, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2288, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2292, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine conducted in vitro"}, {"text": "Since the structure and mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are exactly same except an additional hydroxy moiety in one terminal in HCQ, both act as a weak base that can change the pH of acidic intracellular organelles including endosomes/lysosomes, essential for the membrane fusion. It is believed that both the agents could be effective tools against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11] . However, an important question that still remains is whether HCQ has a similar effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some data show HCQ effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine and one study found HCQ to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [12, 13] . In addition, HCQ acts effectively on other intracellular bacterial infections such as Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Tropheryma whipplei (Whipple's disease) [14, 15] . Addition of hydroxyl molecule makes HCQ less permeable to blood-retinal barrier and allows faster clearance from retinal pigment cell, thereby suggesting a lesser risk of retinal toxicity with HCQ, as compared to chloroquine [16] . Furthermore, the narrow therapeutic and safety index margin with chloroquine makes HCQ a safer option than chloroquine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 412, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 413, "end": 416, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 771, "end": 774, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 935, "end": 939, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 940, "end": 943, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine conducted in vitro"}, {"text": "An additional issue to be considered in severely sick patients is cytokine storm associated with disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 [17] .The significant decrease in the production of proinflammatory markers and cytokines with HCQ has made this agent a successful disease modifying anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome.

A Chinese study involving more than 100 patients of COVID-19 found chloroquine superior to the control group in reducing symptom duration, exacerbation of pneumonia including radiological improvement and promoting virus-negative seroconversion without any severe side effects [18] . This represents the first human trial ever conducted with chloroquine against COVID-19. Although the detailed results of this trial are not yet published and only available in a letter form, interestingly, this early result led China to include chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China recommended inclusion of chloroquine in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19. In this study, chloroquine was given in dose of 500 mg of chloroquine twice daily in mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia (see Table 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1084, "end": 1091, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Studies conducted with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in human COVID-19"}, {"text": "The second human study which is currently available was conducted with HCQ. In an open-label, non-randomized trial (n \u00bc 36) conducted in Marseille, France, Gautret et al. found that HCQ alone and combination of HCQ plus azithromycin was highly and significantly effective in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage (measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in only three-to six days in COVID-19 subjects, compared to control. The virological clearance day-6 post-inclusion (primary outcome) with HCQ vs. control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p \u00bc 0.001). In addition, the virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion in HCQ plus azithromycin, HCQ and control arm was 100%, 57.1% and 12.5% respectively (p < 0.001). This data suggests a synergistic effect of azithromycin with HCQ. Indeed, azithromycin has shown an antiviral effect against Zika and Ebola viruses in in vitro studies; however, it is not yet known whether it has any action against COVID-19 as well [19] . These results of converting a potential carrier to a seronegative patient are of importance with regards to preventing community transmission of COVID-19. Since the data from Wuhan, China showed that some patients were carrier as long as up to 37 days (usually around 20 days), results of this study are very encouraging in the context of converting a patient to a seronegative subject within 6 days. Interestingly, this study also showed that the effect of HCQ was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. The authors have acknowledged limitations of the study; a small sample size, dropout of six patients and limited follow-up, apart from the non-randomized and open-label nature of the trial. A close look in to this study also suggests that the Cycle threshold (Ct) value for nasopharyngeal swab PCR to call it as a sample negative, was lower (Ct value > 35 was deemed as negative for virus) compared to conventional Ct threshold of >40. Ct is defined as the number of cycles to be run for the PCR test to turn positive. In other words, lower the number of Ct denotes more virus is present and lesser number of cycles are required to hit the threshold. Moreover, nasopharyngeal swab PCR is a less sensitive tool, compared to PCR of Broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum in COVID-19. Furthermore, exclusion of five patients (26%) receiving HCQ from the overall analysis, exaggerate the final results of this study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Studies conducted with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in human COVID-19"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, based on limited available evidences to date, and given the prevailing pandemic of COVID-19, some of the institutions and or organizations have already recognized the utility of chloroquine and HCQ [20] .

A Central Clinical Task Force from Korea who have treated 27 cases of COVID-19 recommend using lopinavir 400mg/Ritonavir 100 mg BID or Chloroquine 500 mg orally per day or Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg orally per day for 7e10 days, in moderate to severe case of COVID-19 [22] . Similarly, The Dutch Center of Disease control in a public document on its website, also suggested the use of chloroquine in those having severe COVID-19 infection admitted in the intensive care unit [23].

However, no benefit of chloroquine was seen in the prevention of influenza and dengue infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, clinical trial [29, 30] . Similarly, chloroquine was active in ex vivo studies but not in the in vivo studies against ebolavirus, nipah and influenza viruses [31e33]. Data of chloroquine against chikungunya virus is even more intriguing. While chloroquine had satisfactory antiviral activity against chikungunya in vitro, animal studies showed increase in virus replication, aggravation of fever and incomplete viral clearance [34] . Human trials of chloroquine showed no improvement in chikungunya acute illness and rather an increase in chronic arthralgia was observed during post-illness period, compared to the controls [35] . The role of chloroquine against Human Immunodeficiency Virus was inconclusive [36] . The only viral disease where chloroquine was modestly effective so far before COVID-19 era was chronic hepatitis C suggesting an increased virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin [37] .
