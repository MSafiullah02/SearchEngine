            "text": "Development and growth of social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram) have given rise to a new business model for e-commerce, frequently known as social commerce. Social commerce utilises web 2.0 technology and a specially designed infrastructure to support online communications and user contributions to assist in the acquisition of products and services [1]. Social commerce technologies are not only delivering a platform for communication between consumers to vendors as well as consumers to consumers but also creating significant challenges for scholars that have led to the development and validation of new models and theories. According to e-commerce marketing statistics, 74% of online consumers are relying on social media to guide their purchases, and 60% of businesses have gained new customers through social media within the US [2]. This highlights the importance of social media for facilitating information diffusion and augmenting towards further growth of e-commerce. Social commerce has proved to be an essential platform for online shoppers where consumers can view the product, read reviews, analyse key information and browse special offers [3]. The use of social commerce drives an active engagement that regularly presents relevant product content within the consumer\u2019s news feed and social media interactions. In this way, consumers can interact with others using likes, comments and tagging posts within their friend network. Moreover, social commerce can help to generate loyal and sustainable customers via word of mouth and by supporting other customers to make timely buying decisions [4]. There are six dimensions of social commerce that create a sustainable social commerce platform: social shopping; rating and review; recommendation and referrals; forums and communities; social media optimisation; social ads and applications [5]. Due to emerging social commerce applications and increasing interest in this topic, researchers have conducted the number of studies to offer an additional contribution and facilitate wider adoption of social commerce platforms. However, in this study, we analyse the role of several different antecedents of social commerce intention and adoption that have been examined within the literature. The analysis revealed that the effect of such antecedents has been inconsistent across different studies in terms of significance and coefficient relationships between independent and dependent variables. No study has yet to conduct a consolidated view of the effect of various antecedents of social commerce intention, use behaviour and other related dependent variables. Also, no study has an attempt to understand the value of the relationships of social commerce adoption. The research model is one of the essential parts of the research. Therefore, it is also essential to understand various independent and dependent variables. However, this study based on social commerce, the research focuses on independent/dependent variables and relationship that influence social commerce adoption. The study is providing a robust view of the variables that will be supportive of creating a concrete research model. The objectives of this study are to summarise the relationships and analyse the weight of the relationship using the weight analysis technique. This study to gain new insight into the various predictors of social commerce related dependent variables including intention, trust, satisfaction, attitude and urge to buy impulsively.",

Therefore, we eliminated the conference paper, internet and newspaper blogs and only considered journal articles. Then we separated qualitative and quantitative studies and used quantitative studies for applying weight analysis technique. However, 68 studies were not related to social commerce adoption. Finally, we focus on 73 journal articles which are related to social commerce adoption and published from 2006 to 2019.",

Additionally, less than four of the relationships were considered as experimental variables with a weight of 0.80 or above., Independent variables could be considered as a promising predictor when used in less the five studies and have the perfect weight of 1 [31].

However, the independent variables such as consumer attitude, arousal, pleasure, affective trust in recommender, serendipity information, scarcity, para social interaction and perceived enjoyment relationship with the urge to buy impulsively found significant with weight \u201c1\u201d.

However, it is essential that a robust research model needs reliable variables, and this study provided a summary of those variables. The results revealed the most important independent and dependent variables that influence social commerce adoption. Using weight analysis technique, the study finds out the different value of the predictors. The study found Trust, behavioural intention, social commerce intention, urge to buy impulsively, satisfaction and attitude that used in maximum studies that influence social commerce. The weight analysis has identified the best, moderate and worst predictors of consumer adoption for social commerce. The analysis of this study found that Trust to purchase intention, information quality with Trust, social support with social commerce intention and satisfaction, informational quality with behavioural intention, perceived enjoyment with attitude and hedonic shopping value with the urge to buy are the best predictors. There is no study without limitation. However, this study points out some limitation and recommend future step for the scholar to take forward this study. Firstly, the study has considered journal papers. Therefore, future research could involve conference papers to minimise publication bias. Secondly, the study did not include any control variables. However, future research can separately analyse them and can showcase their impact on the independent/dependent variables. Thirdly, this study considers the essential variables and relationship that influence social commerce adoption. However, some other variables appeared in less study. A future study could involve those for a better view. Lastly, the study considered the weight analysis method. Therefore, Future research can extend this study further using a different method such as Meta-analysis with the combination of weight analysis.",
