The following patients were excluded from the analysis: (i) immunosuppressed patients; (ii) patients not tested for bacterial agents of CAP within 24 h of admission; (iii) patients with a diagnosis of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Bacterial testing within 24 h of admission included the following: blood and respiratory cultures (e.g., sputum, pleural fluid, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage), pneumococcus urinary antigen, Legionella urinary antigen, serology for atypical pathogens, and lung biopsy. The GLIMP coordinating center was located at the University of Texas Health, San Antonio, in San Antonio, TX, USA. The coordinating center received expedited project approval by the institutional review board (number HSC20150184E).

The EPIC study, which was a prospective, multicenter, population-based, active surveillance study conducted by the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 2010 and 2012, enrolled 2259 adult patients hospitalized with CAP in the USA. The authors found a pathogen in only 37.7% of the cases [17] [18] [19] [20] . On the contrary, in the Medicare administrative database, a pathogen was identified in 7.6% of the CAP cases [21] . When compared with previous studies, the novelty of the GLIMP approach lies in its point-prevalence design, international nature (222 centers in 54 countries in 6 continents), and the analysis of real-life data. Furthermore, the GLIMP approach differs from the Medicare database for its primary rather than administrative data collection. Several other factors may also account for the different results reported by the GLIMP study and the Medicare database. The review of the Medicare database was published in 2011 but was performed in 2009, 6 years before the GLIMP study was performed: the microbiological progress may partially justify this difference. Second, the Medicare review findings may reflect the implementation of the 2007 ATS/IDSA CAP CPGs, which discouraged any microbiological studies in most cases, and the issue of cost in the USA health care system [22] . Third, GLIMP data were derived from clinical sites, which are mostly tertiary care centers, whereas Medicare data might have included both tertiary and non-tertiary health care centers. Despite the variability of study-related characteristics, the persistently low pathogen detection yield highlights the suboptimal understanding of the dynamics of CAP etiology and the weak evidence supporting recommendations for empirical antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, studies implementing innovative pathogendiscovery approaches are urgently needed [22] . Our findings confirmed a substantial variability of CAP etiology depending on the geographic region and the clinical setting. S. pneumoniae was the most prevalent etiology overall both in the non-ICU and ICU settings [18, [23] [24] [25] . However, S. pneumoniae prevalence ranged from 17.9% CAP cases in Spain to 2.2% CAP cases in India. This substantial variability in pneumococcal CAP cases may reflect the variability in pneumococcal vaccination rates and serotype circulation across regions [26, 27] . Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found to be an important agent of CAP, mainly in India and other Asian and African countries [28, 29] .",

Our secondary analysis highlighted a high prevalence of S. aureus CAP cases in the USA, at the point that S. aureus CAP was more frequent than S. pneumoniae CAP in the USA (7.5% vs. 4.8% of the CAP cases in the overall population). The unusual etiologic distribution of CAP in the USA may result from an epidemiological shift due to the broad pneumococcal vaccination coverage in the USA [26, 27] . This shift in microbiology patterns may have important implications in the antibiotic treatment guideline recommendations. Among S. aureus CAP in the USA, MRSA accounted for more than half of the cases. Similarly, Moran and collaborators detected MRSA in 14 out of 627 (2.4%) of the patients hospitalized with CAP in the USA [30] .",

Frailty of patients harboring P. aeruginosa and severity of MRSA CAP may explain the higher frequency of P. aeruginosa and MRSA in the ICU [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . These data strengthen the need for prompt microbiological testing in severe CAP cases, as those managed in the ICU. Furthermore, the not-infrequent occurrence of MRSA and P. aeruginosa CAP in the ICU calls for the selection of empirical antimicrobials based on the evaluation of pathogen-specific risk factors and for careful antimicrobial stewardship approaches in the ICU. Antimicrobial stewardship should allow a rapid deescalation of unnecessary antimicrobial treatments once microbiological tests are available and also an appropriate antimicrobial treatment duration.",

Of note, when applied to the UK CAP patients, BTS CPGs appropriately covered 89.5% of the CAP cases, while ATS/IDSA and ERS CPGs covered more than 93% of the cases. Similarly, the performance of ERS CPGs was inferior to the performance of the 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs, even when applied to European countries, such as Spain, Italy, UK, Germany, and Croatia. The suboptimal performance of country-specific CPGs in the epidemiological settings where they were meant to be applied suggests the presence of pitfalls in these CPGs. We could speculate that the following factors may have contributed to the low performance of country-specific CPGs: (i) BTS CPGs allow \u03b2-lactam monotherapy and macrolide monotherapy in the non-ICU setting, leaving uncovered atypical agents of CAP and several Gram-negative pathogens, respectively; (ii) anti MRSA and anti P. aeruginosa empirical treatments are not suggested in the ICU by the BTS CPGs; (iii) Croatian CPGs favor \u03b2-lactam monotherapy in the non-ICU setting, leaving uncovered atypical agents of CAP; (iv) differences in the identification of P. aeruginosa risk factors. Similarly, the difference between the 2019 ATS/IDSA and the ERS CPGs may be associated with the more restrictive use of anti MRSA coverage based on the ERS CPGs and with the more selective anti P. aeruginosa treatment indications based on the 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs. In addition, the ERS recommendations attempt to provide a single set of recommendations for a large number of countries, which differ for geographic distribution, ecology, and health care system (see Electronic Supplementary Materials).",

Similar results were found when anti P. aeruginosa treatment recommendations and P. aeruginosa CAP in ICU were evaluated. The high number of anti MRSA and anti P. aeruginosa empiric therapies recommended by the CPGs should prompt future studies to better define local risk factors for MRSA and P. aeruginosa, as suggested by the 2019 ATS/ IDSA CPGs. More stringent recommendations may reduce the use of unnecessary therapies, leading to a decrease in the rate of drug-related adverse events and of antimicrobial resistance.",

Finally, the results of the GLIMP study are indicative of the testing efforts and the etiology of CAP in 2015 and cannot be generalized to any time period before or after the year 2015.
