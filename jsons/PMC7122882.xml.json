Melting points were measured by a hot stage melting point apparatus (uncorrected). For flash chromatography, Wakogel C-300E (Wako) or aluminum oxide 90 standardized (Merck) was employed. For preparative TLC, TLC silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) or TLC aluminum oxide 60 F254 basic (Merck), or NH2 Silica Gel 60 F254 Plate (Wako) were employed. For analytical HPLC, a COSMOSIL 5C18-ARII column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) was employed with method A [a linear gradient of CH3CN containing 0.1 % (v/v) TFA] or method B [a linear gradient of CH3CN containing 0.1 % (v/v) NH3] at a flow rate of 1 mL/min on a Shimadzu LC-10ADvp (Shimadzu Corp., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), and eluting products were detected by UV at 254 nm. Preparative HPLC was performed using a COSMOSIL 5C18-ARII column (20 \u00d7 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque Inc.) with a linear gradient of MeCN containing 0.1 % (v/v) NH3 at a flow rate of 8 mL/min on Shimadzu LC-6AD (Shimadzu corporation, Ltd). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL AL-400 or a JEOL ECA-500 spectrometer, and chemical shifts are reported in \u03b4 (ppm) relative to Me4Si (CDCl3) or DMSO (DMSO-d\n6) as internal standards. 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL AL-400 or JEOL ECA-500 spectrometer and referenced to the residual solvent signal. 19F\u2013NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL ECA-500 and referenced to the internal CFCl3 (\u03b4\nF 0.00 ppm). 1H-NMR spectra are tabulated as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (b = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet), coupling constant(s), and number of protons. Exact mass (HRMS) spectra were recorded on a JMS-HX/HX 110A mass spectrometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained on a JASCO FT/IR-4100 FT-IR spectrometer with JASCO ATR PRO410-S. The purity of the compounds was determined by combustion analysis or HPLC analysis as >95 % unless otherwise stated. Synthesis and characterization data of compounds 2, 4, 7, and 10 are shown in 10.1007/978-4-431-54445-6_2. Synthesis and characterization data of compounds 1, 18e-g, 18i, 19e, 20s, 20t, 21f, 21g, 21i, 21s, 21t, 34a and 35a are shown in 10.1007/978-4-431-54445-6_2.",
