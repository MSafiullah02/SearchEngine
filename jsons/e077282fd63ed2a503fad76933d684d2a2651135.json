Three types of IFN have now been described, simply referred to as type I, II and III. Distinguishable by the unique receptors that they rely on for signal transduction, the three types of IFN have specific and varied roles in the maintenance of human health and defense against pathogens. In mounting an IFN-mediated immune response, the human body has developed the ability to regulate IFN-mediated signal transduction. Like all cytokines, the ability of a cell to respond to IFN is completely dependent on the presence of its cognate receptor on the surface of the target cell. Thus, one of the major mechanisms used by the human body to regulate the strength and duration of the IFN response is through regulation of receptor levels, thereby altering the cytokine-specific responsiveness of the target cell.

There are nine identified mammalian type I IFN subtypes including IFN-a, of which there are 13 known subtypes, and single forms of IFN-b, IFN-e, IFN-k, IFN-o, IFN-d, IFN-t, IFN-v, IFN-z. 4 These cytokines can share as much as 100% homology (between certain IFNa subtypes) to as little as B20% homology (in a triad between IFNa, IFNb and IFNe subtypes). Although the most widely studied subtypes are IFNa and IFNb, evolutionary conservation would suggest that each subtype has unique and perhaps tissue-specific roles to play in human health and disease. However, not all subtypes are found in humans-IFN-d is found only in pigs whereas IFN-t is found only in ruminant animals. 4 The type I IFNs are acid stable, a feature which has assisted in the development of protocols for purification of these cytokines for therapeutic applications. 5 In contrast, there is only one type II IFN, IFNg. 4 IFNg is acid labile, a feature that distinguishes it from the type I IFNs. Also known as IL28A/IL28B and IL29, three type III IFNs have been identified. 3 Now termed IFNls due to the common mode of viral induction they share with the type I IFNs, these cytokines have higher structural homology with IL-10/IL-22 rather than to the type I IFNs despite having higher amino-acid identity with the IFNs. 6 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 288, "end": 289, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 660, "end": 661, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1151, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1313, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1365, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1520, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1767, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The three IFN types are distinguished by the use of distinctive but related multi-chain cell-surface receptor complexes (see Figure 1 , Table 1 ).

IFNAR2 exists as three isoforms transcribed from the same gene by exon skipping, alternative splicing and differential usage of polyadenylation sites. 8 The most well-characterized form of IFNAR2, IFNAR2c, exists as a long transmembrane form with a full intracellular domain and is required for a complete type I IFNinduced anti-viral response via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascade. 9 IFNAR2 also exists as a short transmembrane form lacking the intracellular domain (IFNAR2b) and a soluble form truncated before the transmembrane region (IFNAR2a), but possessing 11 additional carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic amino acids not found in the extracellular domains of the other two forms. IFNAR2b reportedly acts as a dominant negative regulator of type I IFN activity at least in cell types where it is expressed. 10 Studies in our laboratory have shown that the soluble form of IFNAR2 (IFNAR2a) is found circulating in the blood and can exhibit both agonistic and antagonistic properties in certain circumstances. 11 Although the complete functionality of soluble IFNAR2 in type I IFN signal transduction requires further elucidation, soluble forms of receptors are clearly essential in other cytokine systems. 12 Figure 1 Representation of the distinct receptor systems employed by type I, type II and type III IFNs for signal transduction. Ligand engagement of these receptors initiates a signaling cascade that utilizes the receptor-associated JAK kinases for receptor phosphorylation and subsequent STAT activation. 7 STATs activated following type I and type III IFN receptor engagement can drive expression of genes with either ISRE or GAS elements in their promoters, whereas signaling via the type II IFN receptor complex almost exclusively drives the expression of genes with GAS promoters elements. 27 Structurally, while IFNAR2 is typical of all other class II hCRs, the low-affinity receptor IFNAR1 is unique amongst the class II hCRs being comprised of four FBN-III domains in the extracellular domain. 7 The functional consequences of a receptor with such an unusually elongated architecture, as compared with all other members of the same protein family, are yet to be fully demonstrated. One of the most compelling questions about the functionality of the type I IFN receptor system is how so many ligands can signal through the same heterodimeric receptor but drive a diverse array of biological signals. Although IFNa2 and IFNb bind competitively to the IFNAR complex, a number of studies have shown that these cytokines engage the receptor components in ligand-specific manners. [13] [14] [15] The consequences of the different modes of receptor engagement by these two ligands are reflected in the distinct gene sets they induce and the disparate biological responses they generate. 16 The affinity of the various ligands for IFNAR1, the stability of the ternary complex and the number of receptors presented on a cells surface have all been shown to participate in dictating ligand-specific biological responses. [16] [17] [18] Recently, the crystal structures of both extracellular ternary IFNa and IFNo IFNAR signaling complexes were determined. 19 From these structures it is apparent that the ligands have conserved anchor points for receptor engagement but also make ligand-specific receptor interactions that influence the biological outcome. 19 These structures confirm that it is the ligand-specific interactions that influence ternary complex stability, and that the affinity of the ligands for IFNAR1 defines the resultant biological outcome of ligand engagement. 19 Although IFNAR1 in the ternary complex structures was truncated before the membrane proximal FBN-III domain, the structures have given us a greater understanding of differential ligand engagement of a shared receptor but also suggest that every ligand engages the receptor complex in its own particular way.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 379, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1101, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1302, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1807, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2302, "end": 2303, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2884, "end": 2888, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2893, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2894, "end": 2898, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3089, "end": 3091, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3320, "end": 3324, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3325, "end": 3329, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3330, "end": 3334, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3455, "end": 3457, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3656, "end": 3658, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3881, "end": 3883, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 223, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1508, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "INTERFERON RECEPTOR SYSTEMS"}, {"text": "To transduce signals via the JAK/STAT pathway, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and JAK1, respectively, for the kinase activity required for receptor phosphorylation and STAT recruitment to the receptor complex. 4 In the human system, Tyk2 has been shown to be required for stability of IFNAR1 on the cell surface. 20 A similar role for the IFNAR2-associated JAK1 has not been demonstrated. Although IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 have not been found to be pre-associated, they are both required for full type I IFN-dependent STAT activation and the development of an effective anti-viral state. 21 Type II IFN Unlike the type I IFNs, which all appear to signal as monomeric cytokines, IFNg signals as an anti-parellel homodimer. 22 . The complex through which this cytokine signals is composed of four transmembrane-spanning receptors; two chains of each of the high-affinity (IFNGR1) and low-affinity receptors (IFNGR2). 4 The IFNg homodimer engages directly with the two IFNGR1 chains on opposing sides of the cytokine dimer. 22 IFNGR1 has been shown to be pre-associated with IFNGR2 23 and although the ligand does not engage IFNGR2 directly, ligand-induced conformational changes in both receptors have been reported. 23 Despite the fact that both IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 are not always present together on the surface of all cells (see Table 2 ), both receptor components are required for full activity of IFNg. 24 For signal transduction via the JAK/STAT pathway, IFNGR1 binds to JAK1 whereas IFNGR2 binds to JAK2. 25 Although both kinases are necessary for signal transduction, only JAK1 has been demonstrated to be required for the formation of the full IFNg signaling complex. 23 Type III IFN Similar to the type I IFNs, the type III IFNs signal as monomeric cytokines engaging one copy of each of their low-affinity and highaffinity receptors. However, unlike both the type I and type II IFNs, which employ their own dedicated receptors, the IFNls utilize one unique receptor (IFNLR1) but also one required for signal transduction by IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26 (IL10RB). 3, 26 The receptor-associated JAK kinases, JAK1 with IFNLR1 and Tyk2 with IL10RB are responsible for activation of the JAK/STAT pathway upon IFNl engagement of this receptor complex. 7 As IL10RB is also common to the signaling complexes for IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26, it remains to be seen whether there is any functional cross-talk between the type III IFNs and these cytokines as a result of having a shared receptor.

All IFNs utilize the JAK/STAT pathway for signal transduction 7 (see Table 1 ). Much research has shown that specific combinations of STAT homo-and heterodimers activate target genes by binding to either interferon response factor 9 (IRF9), which couples the STAT/ IRF complex to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) or directly to GAS elements found in the promoter regions of IFN target genes. 27 ISRE-binding STAT combinations include STAT1/2 and STAT2/6 heterodimers and STAT2 homodimers; however, IFNg has been shown to induce ISRE-binding STAT1 homodimers. 28 GAS elements are generally recognized by STAT1, 3, 4, 5 homodimers and STAT1/2 or 1/3 heterodimers. 27 Despite co-reliance on the JAK/ STAT pathway, the STATs that each of the IFN types activate may be different. For anti-viral activity, the type I IFNs activate primarily STAT-1 and -2, whereas STAT-3, -4, -5 and -6 can also be activated by IFNAR engagement in certain cell types (reviewed by Platanias 29 ). Although IFNg signal transduction predominantly activates STAT1 homodimers, STAT3 homo-and STAT1-STAT3 heterodimers can also be generated. 27 Like the type I IFNs, the type III IFNs activate both STAT1 and STAT2 and can therefore drive the transcription of genes with either ISRE or GAS elements. 30 However, in some cell types the type III IFNs can also induce the activation of STAT-3, -4 and -5. 31 As the type I and type III IFNs utilize the same JAKs and STATs for signal transduction, it is not surprising that these cytokines have similar biological functions in certain instances. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that IFNa and IFNl induce a similar set of genes, albeit that the expression induced by IFNl was weaker than that of IFNa in certain cell types. 32 It seems that the importance of type III IFN signaling lies in the narrow range of cells that have the ability to respond to these cytokines (see below). Besides the JAK/STAT pathway, type I, II and III IFNs can also activate other signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3-Kinase pathways 29,32 (see Table 1 ). The type I and type II IFNs have also been shown to activate and signal via the NFkB pathway; 33, 34 however, although experimental evidence does not exist to support the activation of the NFkB pathway directly following IFNl stimulation, bioinformatic analysis of the promoters of the three type III IFN genes suggests the presence of binding sites for NFkB. 29 The type I and II IFNs have also been shown to activate a CRKL-dependent pathway important for activation of Rap1 and subsequent antagonism of the Ras pathway thus promoting tumor suppression and the growth inhibitory effects observed for IFNs 35 (reviewed by Platanias 29 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 556, "end": 558, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 723, "end": 725, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 826, "end": 828, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1133, "text": "Platanias 29", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1278, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1436, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1538, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1906, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2318, "end": 2321, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2324, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2586, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2847, "end": 2859, "text": "Platanias 29", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 218, "end": 225, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2220, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "PATHWAYS OF INTERFERON SIGNALING"}, {"text": "Generally, IFNs are produced by the body to fight infection or in an allergic response. 4 Following induction, ligand binding to the IFN receptor complexes initiates the transduction of signals that culminate in the transcriptional activation of gene sets, the nature of which is dependent on a number of factors including the stimulus and the IFN type/subtype. Although the defining activity of the IFNs is their ability to invoke an anti-viral response in the host organism, these cytokines are collectively involved in many more immune responses. Of the IFNs, the type I IFNs have the broadest range of biological activities having both protective and counter-protective effects in different immune situations. 36 Although type I IFNs are protective in viral infection, IFNb signaling causes lethality during certain bacterial infections 36 but protection against certain protozoa and fungi. [37] [38] [39] Although the mechanism of IFNb toxicity in sepsis is yet to be fully elucidated, it is apparent that IFNb engagement of IFNAR1 during sepsis initiates the transmission of these lethal signals; Tyk2 also has a role. 40, 41 Numerous studies have utilized IFNAR1-null mice or cells, or anti-IFNAR1-neutralizing antibodies to demonstrate the importance of this receptor and type I IFN signal transduction for the maintenance of health and prevention of disease. Using these resources, IFNAR1 has been shown to have a role in tumor surveillance and cancer immunoediting, 42 and to alter the cell cycle, inhibit cell growth and suppress cancer. 43 This receptor also transmits signals involved in regulation of the immune system through the promotion of B-cell survival, 44, 45 induction of cross-priming of T cells, 46,47 enhancement of humoral immunity, 48 and regulation of natural killer (NK) cell function 49 (reviewed in Hervas-Stubbs et al. 50 ). Interestingly, the type I IFNs have also been shown to be components in seemingly conflicting activities of cell survival, 51 and in the promotion 52 and prevention of apoptosis. 44 These contrasting biological outcomes of IFN signaling may be due to differential receptor expression levels on the target cell and/or cell-specific expression of components of the IFNAR receptor or an unknown cell-specific regulatory mechanisms or elements that restrict IFN activities in certain cell types.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 89, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 714, "end": 716, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 895, "end": 899, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 900, "end": 904, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1131, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1478, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1551, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1681, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1817, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1854, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1983, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2007, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2039, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EFFECTS OF IFNS DURING IMMUNE RESPONSES"}, {"text": "One organ in which IFNb has significant importance is the CNS where, in the absence of IFNa, 53 IFNb has been shown to be vital for viral immunity and protection from autoimmune disease such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. 54 In contrary to the lethality resulting from the IFNb/IFNAR1 association seen in sepsis, this ligand-receptor interaction is protective in the CNS. 54 In an elegant study by Prinz et al., 55, 56 cell-specific knockdown of IFNAR1 in CNS cells allowed the identification of myeloid cells as the effector target cell of IFNb activity in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

However, as the ability of cells to respond to cytokines is absolutely dependent on the presentation of the required receptor components on the cell surface, it is apparent that due to the strictly regulated distribution of IFN receptor components, the different types of IFN have either widespread or cell/tissue-specific functions based on the presentation of their receptors on the surfaces of target cells. The receptors for the type I and II IFNs, and the IL10RB involved in IFNl signaling are generally widely distributed and found on the surface of most cell types (see Table 2 ).

As the IFNAR receptors are generally widely expressed, the type I IFNs have a broad range of target cells.

Regardless of the almost ubiquitous nature of type I IFN signaling, there are isolated examples of differential receptor expression for IFNAR2 with low levels of IFNAR2 message reported in the brain. To understand the implications of this to IFN signal transduction, there is a need for detailed studies of the relative levels of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 protein expression in particular cell types/organs and during different cellular processes. Furthermore, even though the effects of most IFNs have been shown to be protective, IFNb is the exception showing lethality in some models of bacterial infection but protection against viruses and autoimmune disease. Perhaps the process by which IFNb transduces such contrasting functions involves differential use of the IFNARs in certain circumstances, thus leading to the induction of alternative gene sets.
