Approximately 50 percent of U.S. residents traveled to destinations other than Europe; these destinations included almost 5 million trips to Asia, more than 2.2 million trips to South and Central America, 1.3 million trips to the Middle East, and 500,000 trips to the African continent.1 An estimated 15 percent to 70 percent of adult travelers report health problems during international travel; 1 percent to 5 percent of travelers seek medical care during travel, 0.1 percent to 1 percent are hospitalized abroad, 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent require emergency evacuation, and 1 in 100,000 die.2, 3 Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity among international travelers.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 An estimated 40 percent of persons traveling annually from industrialized to developing countries develop travelers\u2019 diarrhea.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Malaria is a less frequent but potentially life-threatening problem for travelers; an estimated 30,000 North American and European travelers contract malaria annually.10 Other infectious diseases reported in travelers include hepatitis A and B, sexually transmitted diseases, animal bites with risk of rabies, typhoid, cholera, legionellosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and meningococcal disease.3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27\n",

Extrapolating from overseas travel data for U.S. residents, one can estimate conservatively that at least 1.9 million children travel overseas annually (ie, 7% of the 26.9 million U.S. residents traveling internationally in 2000 reported traveling with children). Information on the causes of serious morbidity and mortality among pediatric travelers is more limited.28, 29, 30, 31 Available data include a 1-year prospective hospital-based study in the United Kingdom of children evaluated for fever who had traveled recently to the tropics.30 In this study, 31 children with a median age of 4 years (range, 5 months to 15 years) met the study entry criteria. Fourteen of these children had nonspecific, self-limited illnesses of presumed viral origin, and 17 children had conditions requiring hospital management and antimicrobial therapy. Conditions requiring hospital management included four cases of malaria (3 of Plasmodium falciparum, and 1 of Plasmodium vivax malaria), three cases of bacillary dysentery, two cases each of dengue and typhoid fever, and one case each of acute hepatitis A infection, pneumonia (unspecified), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (in a child with newly diagnosed HIV infection), bacterial lymphadenitis, streptococcal throat infection, and acute myeloid leukemia; no deaths occurred. In another retrospective study of travelers\u2019 diarrhea among Swiss children who had visited the tropics or subtropics, Pitzinger and coworkers found incidence rates of 40 percent, 8.5 percent, 21.7 percent, and 36 percent in children aged 2 years or younger, 3 to 6 years, 7 to 14 years, and 15 years and older, respectively.31 Other authors have reported substantial health risks for pediatric travelers from noninfectious causes such as injuries, including automobile accidents and drowning.29\n",

For example, diphtheria and pertussis are prevalent in Eastern Europe and many developing countries, and measles still is endemic in much of the developing world. Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and varicella also are endemic in many developing countries. Further, although worldwide polio eradication efforts have decreased the number of countries where travelers are at risk for acquiring polio (with most poliovirus transmission now occurring in 2 large endemic areas in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa), polio outbreaks still occur; in July 2000, outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 were reported in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.32, 33 Trip activities also may increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases such as measles; in both 2001 and 2004, epidemiological investigations identified numerous cases of serologically confirmed measles among internationally adopted children and their new parents and siblings, who had traveled to China to accompany them home.34, 35 In addition, travel in large groups on conveyances such as cruise ships can facilitate transmission of VPDs.36 Parents should check their own immune status because travel with children can increase risk of exposure to VPDs.",

These measures include wearing clothing that reduces the amount of exposed skin (such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants tucked into socks, and hats) and, whenever possible, remaining in well-screened or enclosed air-conditioned areas. Travelers staying overnight in facilities without air conditioning or screens should use insecticide-treated mosquito nets over the beds.50 During the evening, insecticide also can be sprayed inside rooms. Another important measure of personal protection is appropriate use of insect repellent, such as N,N-diethylmetatoluamide (DEET), on exposed skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended using repellents with less than 30 percent DEET for infants and children.51 DEET should not be used in children younger than 2 months of age or applied to hands, mouth, or near the eyes of young children. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of these measures, studies have found only 17 percent of adult travelers with malaria reported using insect protection methods, and only 11 percent took recommended chemoprophylaxis.52\n",

From 1992 through early 2001, CDC received reports of seven U.S. travelers who died from malaria after using inappropriate chemoprophylaxis. All these travelers had received prescriptions for chloroquine for travel to areas with widespread chloroquine resistance. Among 4685 cases of imported malaria with information about chemoprophylaxis during 1992 through early 2001, 2616 (56%) took no chemoprophylaxis, and 893 (19%) took an inappropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen.56 In addition to being given preventive therapy, parents should be counseled in signs and symptoms of malaria infection in children, such as fever, headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias.

Dengue is transmitted primarily by day-biting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in flower vases, barrels, and discarded tires that collect water. Transmission occurs in rural and urban areas, but the risk is greatest in urban areas. Prevention should focus on protection against mosquito bites. Travelers to risk areas should be counseled to apply repellent during the day, even while visiting cities.

Several outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been reported among groups of U.S. visitors who entered a cave with bats in Costa Rica (CDC, unpublished data),65 Ecuador,66 Peru,67 and Nicaragua.68 Recently, more than 200 college students became infected with histoplasmosis during a spring break trip to Acapulco, Mexico.69 Two outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis have been reported among youth missionary groups involved in construction work in Mexico.70, 71 Most of these fungal outbreaks have two common features: high-risk, group activities and high attack rates, even in young, nonimmunocompromised individuals.

Travelers\u2019 diarrhea, caused by ingestion of contaminated food and water, affects between approximately 20 to 50 percent of adult travelers, and it is the most frequent health problem reported by travelers to developing countries.8 In terms of children, a retrospective study conducted by Pitzinger and coworkers among Swiss children who had visited the tropics or subtropics reported similar incidence rates of traveler\u2019s diarrhea in children: 40 percent, 8.5 percent, 21.7 percent, and 36 percent in children aged 0 to 2 years, 3 to 6 years, 7 to 14 years, and 15 years and older, respectively.31 In this study, the authors also found that small children (0 to 2 years) most frequently were affected with travelers\u2019 diarrhea and that the clinical course tended to be more severe and prolonged when compared with older pediatric age groups. Overall, children were found to have longer-lasting illness than that in adults, with an average duration of 11 days for all children combined and 29 days for small children. Enteric pathogens typically are isolated from approximately 50 to 75 percent of stool specimens from adult travelers with diarrhea; in the remainder, usually no pathogen is isolated. Escherichia coli, especially enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), is the most common overall cause of travelers\u2019 diarrhea (although incidence can vary by destination), followed by Camplobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella. Other etiologic agents include pathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas and Plesiomonas, protozoa (eg, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Crypotospiridium spp., and Cyclospora cayetanensis), viruses such as rotavirus or Norwalk-like viruses, and rarely helminthes.78 Numerous risk factors for traveler\u2019s diarrhea also have been identified and include the consumption of certain high-risk foods (raw foods such as meats, seafood, and vegetables, unpasteurized dairy products, and ice and tap water) and travel to certain destinations.6, 8 Destinations generally considered to have a high risk for travelers\u2019 diarrhea include Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; low-risk travel destinations include North America, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.32 Location of food preparation also is a recognized risk factor for traveler\u2019s diarrhea, with a higher risk shown for travelers eating from street vendors and in local restaurants and a lower risk for those eating in luxury hotels and private homes.",

Increasingly, the Internet and computer-based travel resources are being used by practitioners and consumers alike because they provide current information that can be used to counsel and treat international travelers appropriately and effectively.79 A summary of some selected travel health resources that can be useful for providing information on health risks in specific travel destinations and current travel health recommendations (including immunizations and chemoprophylaxis) is provided in Table 1. In addition, if health care provided overseas is not covered by a family\u2019s health insurance company, insurance can be purchased from several companies and can include airlift/medical evacuation. The U.S. Embassy or consulate can provide names and addresses of English-speaking healthcare providers in the travel destination if medical evaluation is needed abroad. This information can be obtained before departure from Embassy Internet sites or by calling the embassy. In addition, names of physicians abroad also can be obtained from some worldwide directories, including those of the International Society of Travel Medicine, at www.istm.org.",
