We query the validity of the authors' experimental approach, which involved western blots only, on the confirmation of the ELISA positive samples.",

These confirmatory assays were aimed at eliminating the false positives potentially caused by the cross-reactivity between antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins of other human coronaviruses and those of SARS virus. However, the authors overlooked the possibility of an interaction between residual E coli antigens and naturally occurring antibodies against E coli in the hosts as another potential source of false positives. They did not discuss the purity of the purified E coli-expressed antigens, which is a crucial factor in the interaction because a tiny amount of residual E coli antigen is sufficient to interfere with the diagnostic assay. Moreover, the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against E coli in serum from healthy individuals has been reported previously.2, 3, 4 Such antibodies are mainly present because of infection with common E coli strains and the natural intestinal flora in healthy individuals.",

First, the authors did not present the corresponding western-blot results to show the binding specificity\u2014ie, a single prominent band of the target antigen\u2014which is needed to exclude the possibility of cross-reactivity between the host's antibodies and the residual E coli antigens. Second, the molecular size of both target antigens (ie, spike and nucleocapsid) are virtually the same (about 50 kDa), which could create a problem with respect to the validity of the diagnostic assay if contaminating E coli antigens of a similar size are present. In our opinion, Woo and colleagues should use other independent diagnostic systems to control for various sources of false positives\u2014eg, western-blot assays with antigens of significantly different molecular sizes or antigens expressed in another system, ELISA with viral cell-culture extract as the coating antigen, or indirect immunofluorescence.",

The differences between these two studies are unknown, but bearing in mind their importance with respect to the possible human reservoir for SARS-virus infection in Hong Kong, such serological studies must be carefully designed to eliminate false positives.",
