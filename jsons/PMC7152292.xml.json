at higher dosages animals can develop apnea.5.If seizures stop, continue CRI of diazepam or midazolam for 4 to 6 hours, then gradually discontinue the CRI over 4 to 6 hours.6.If seizures recur after stopping the CRI, restart a diazepam or midazolam CRI for another 6 hours and continue phenobarbital 2 mg/kg IV, IM, PO BID.7.If seizures do not stop with repeated diazepam or midazolam, then give propofol 4 to 8 mg/kg IV and start a propofol CRI at 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg/min IV for 4 to 6 hours.8.If seizures stop, then gradually discontinue propofol CRI over 4 to 6 hours.9.If seizures do not stop with diazepam, midazolam, or propofol, then consider pentobarbital 2 to 15 mg/kg IV over several minutes, then a pentobarbital CRI of 0.5 mg/kg/hr IV for 4 to 6 hours.\nCaution:\na.Severe cardiopulmonary depression can occur.b.Endotracheal intubation may be necessary.c.Intensive monitoring is essential.d.Animal may be neurologically abnormal for up to 1 week after pentobarbital CRI.\n\nB.Initial emergency treatment involves controlling the seizure with short-acting anticonvulsants and initiating treatment with long-acting anticonvulsants.1.Benzodiazepines are used for initial treatment.2.\nDiazepam is the drug of choice.a.It can be used for seizures or during the postictal phase.b.It may be administered IV, rectally, or intranasally.\n3.Midazolam can be used as an alternative.\nC.In reactive epilepsy, treatment of the underlying etiology is undertaken.D.With cryptogenic or idiopathic epileptic seizures, long-term anticonvulsive drugs are initiated simultaneously with benzodiazepine administration.E.If seizures stop after emergency treatment, then continue with long-term anticonvulsants.\nII.The goal of long-term treatment is to provide chronic control of seizure activity.A.Theoretically, the goal is complete control of seizure activity (without side effects); however, this is rarely achieved.B.A more realistic goal is to decrease the severity and frequency of seizures, and to prevent cluster seizures and status epilepticus while maintaining a good quality of life.C.Successful long-term treatment requires dedication and understanding of realistic goals by the owners.1.Treatment is lifelong.2.Anticonvulsants must be given on a regular, daily basis.3.Seizure emergencies may occur despite appropriate treatment.4.Good knowledge of the potential side effects of anticonvulsants is imperative.\nD.Reasons to initiate long-term anticonvulsive therapy include the following:1.After status epilepticus or cluster seizures2.After the occurrence of two or more isolated seizure events within a 6- to 8-week period3.After prolonged postictal periods4.In cases where an identifiable structural lesion is causing seizures5.Delayed onset of seizure activity after head trauma\n\nIII.Long-term anticonvulsants are initiated after emergency control of seizures (Table 22-3\n).A.Phenobarbital is the anticonvulsant of choice and can be used in both dogs and cats.1.After emergency treatment, start phenobarbital at 2 to 5 mg/kg PO, IM, IV BID.2.If seizures persist despite initial emergency treatment, a loading dosage of phenobarbital can be administered (See Box 23-1).3.Alternatively, a loading dose can be calculated as follows:\nLoading dose(mg)=desired serum level(\u03bcg/mL)\u00d7body weight(kg)\u00d70.8 L/kg (volume of distribution[Vd])\n4.Animals are often heavily sedated for \u226524 hours when using the loading dose.\nB.Potassium bromide (KBr) is a good second choice.1.It can be used in animals already receiving phenobarbital.2.In an emergency, KBr is administered as a loading dose because of its long half-life.3.Loading dosage is 400 to 600 mg/kg PO divided into six equal doses given over 1 to 5 days, depending on the severity of the seizures.4.Alternatively, a target steady state can be achieved based on the following formula:\nTarget steady state concentration(Css)\u00d70.45 L/kg ([Vd])=total dose administered\n5.Target serum concentration for KBr as mono-therapy is 1 to 3 mg/mL, and as adjunctive therapy with phenobarbital is 1 to 2 mg/mL.6.\nIn animals already receiving KBr, the formula for a new oral dose for recurrent seizures is (Podell, 2004):\n(Target Css)-actual Css\u00d7Vd L/kg=(target desired Css-actual Css) \u00d7 0.45 L/kg=mg/kg divided into 4 equal doses QID\n7.KBr can be given PO or per rectum, but not IV.8.Rectal administration can lead to severe diarrhea.9.Maintenance dose is 30 to 40 mg/kg PO SID.10.KBr is slowly increased to effect, to a maximum dose of 60 mg/kg/day PO.11.KBr can be used safely in dogs.12.KBr should be used with caution in cats, because it can result in tachypnea, dyspnea, and coughing (Boothe et al., 2002).a.Dosage is the same as in the dog.b.The half-life is 10 days, with steady-state serum concentrations being reached in 50 days (Boothe et al., 2002).c.KBr is avoided in cats because it may increase the risk of asthma.d.Discontinued if respiratory signs or radiographic changes develop.\n\nC.Sodium bromide (NaBr; 3%) can be given IV.1.It is dissolved in sterile water (0.375 mEq Br/mL + 1.3 mEq Na/mL)2.An IV loading dose is calculated using the following formula:\nSteady-state concentration (Css)\u00d7Vd=total dose administered by constant rate infusion (CRI) in a central vein\n\nD.\nIn cats, the pharmacokinetics of diazepam supports its use as a long-term anticonvulsant.1.Diazepam is given at 0.25 to 1 mg/kg PO BID.2.Side effects include sedation and polyphagia.3.In cats, oral administration can cause fulminant hepatic failure (idiosyncratic reaction), so it is only used as a last choice.4.Diazepam is not used as a long-term anticonvulsant in dogs.a.Dogs develop tolerance to long-term therapy.b.In dogs, the half-life is very short (3 hours).\n\nE.Felbamate can be used in dogs if seizure control is insufficient with phenobarbital and KBr.1.Felbamate is given at 15 to 70 mg/kg PO BID to TID.2.Rare side effects include nervousness, hyperexcitability, liver toxicity, and bone marrow suppression.3.Felbamate may be useful for partial seizures (Ruehlmann et al., 2001).4.No data are available on its use in cats.\nF.Gabapentin can be used in dogs if seizure control is insufficient with phenobarbital and KBr.1.Gabapentin is given at 25 to 60 mg/kg PO TID to QID.2.Short-term side effects include sedation; long-term side effects are unknown.3.No data are available on its use in cats, but administration of up to 30 mg/kg PO TID is anecdotally well tolerated in cats.\nG.Levetiracetam can be used as a second-choice anticonvulsant in dogs if seizure control is insufficient with phenobarbital and KBr.1.Levetiracetam is given at 5 to 30 mg/kg PO BID to TID.2.It can be used in animals with hepatic dysfunction.3.Rare side effects include salivation, restlessness, vomiting, and ataxia.\nH.Zonisamide can be used in dogs if seizure control is insufficient with phenobarbital and KBr.1.Zonisamide is given at 10 mg/kg PO BID (Dewey et al., 2004).2.Animals concurrently receiving phenobarbital may require higher dosages of zonisamide.3.Rare side effects include drowsiness, ataxia, and gastrointestinal irritation.4.Minimal side effects are seen at dosages up to 75 mg/kg/day.\n\nIV.Recommendations for long-term management of seizures is as follows:A.Phenobarbital is the first-choice anticonvulsant because of its faster onset of action, shorter half-life, and more predictable anticonvulsant effects.1.Animals are initially started on phenobarbital at 2 mg/kg PO BID.2.If seizure control is poor after reaching the steady state, the dosage of phenobarbital is gradually increased to approximately 5 mg/kg PO BID.\nB.If seizure control remains poor or severe side effects occur, KBr therapy is initiated at 30 mg/kg PO SID.C.If seizure control remains poor despite the addition of KBr, the dosage of KBr is gradually increased to a maximum of 60 mg/kg PO SID.D.If the animal does not tolerate phenobarbital well, monotherapy with KBr is initiated.E.In animals experiencing side effects or in those that are seizure-free for >1 year, the dosage of anticonvulsants can be gradually decreased.F.Second-choice anticonvulsants are typically used if seizures cannot be controlled with a combination of phenobarbital and KBr, or if side effects are intolerable.\n\n",
