This collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert The 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch's postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.",

Experienced nurse scientists serving as mentors may provide their students with career direction, in the form of coaching and sponsorship, and psychosocial support, in the form of counselling and role modelling. As a practice profession, nursing develops its knowledge base in both academic and clinical settings, allowing for a wide range of mentoring relationships. Within academic settings, mentoring is more likely to begin at the graduate level of education, where more emphasis is placed on research evaluation and use. Nursing faculty with access to mentoring relationships, research resources, and professional development produce more scholarly publications. Increased use of electronic communication technologies has opened opportunities for international mentoring and the development of partnerships between universities in different counties. Still, the close personal relationships characteristic of true mentoring should involve some face-to-face contact. For many women in the profession, peer mentoring plays an important role in their career adjustment, as they seek the advice of those who have managed to balance their professional and their family/personal roles. Mentoring provides a vital connection for older, more experienced nurse scientists to share their knowledge with developing scientists, and maintaining a sustained, supportive mentoring relationship is the most proven way to build research productivity.",

The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) is working to address minority health issues through the recruitment of more minority nurses into research careers. In 2001, NINR began to sponsor a partnership programme that worked to pair historically minority-serving nursing schools with research-intensive institutions. The partnership between North Carolina Central University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill developed the Research Enrichment and Apprenticeship Program (REAP), a year-long research-intensive programme for nine undergraduate minority students from both schools. Over the summer, the REAP students attended seminars in research development and methodology and served as paid student assistants for their research mentors on different research projects. One student became involved with research to assess risk in premature infants, while another student, whose primary language was Spanish, worked on a project for HIV prevention among Mexican immigrants. Each student also developed a research project in conjunction with the mentor's project, as part of the senior year research class. This hands-on research experience may interest students more than the traditional didactic instruction, inspiring them to pursue advanced education and research. Increasing the number of minority nurse researchers will help bring new ideas and culturally sensitive approaches to all areas of health research.",

Differences in how adolescents experience and express anger can influence their long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, and control of anger is related to reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Researchers evaluated the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), a 44-item self-report questionnaire, for its usefulness in measuring anger in 394 adolescents aged 11-16 years. The samples was 38% African American, 32% white, and 30% Hispanic, and roughly equal between boys and girls. The STAXI consists of two subscales: the experience-of-anger scale measures anger intensity and disposition toward an anger state, while the expression-ofanger scale measures how anger is suppressed or expressed toward others and how individuals attempt to control their anger. African American youths had the highest scores in both trait and state anger, while Hispanic youths had the lowest scores in anger expression.
