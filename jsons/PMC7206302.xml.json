Especially, with the advent of GPUs, TPUs, and heterogeneous architectures that accelerate computation, the bottleneck is shifting towards memory performance. The central aspect of prefetching is to be able to accurately predict future memory accesses. This can be seen as a sequence prediction task, which in theory, is well-suited for machine learning. Specifically, LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) based Deep Learning has shown tremendous success in sequence prediction tasks like text prediction [4], along with other natural language tasks such as part of speech tagging [11] and grammar learning [14]. Since memory accesses have an underlying grammar similar to natural language, such models are naturally applicable to learning accesses. Recent work [5, 13, 15] has shown that LSTM based methods indeed lead to higher accuracy than those used in traditional prefetchers.",

For instance, the models proposed in [5] can have more than a million parameters. Such a large number of parameters (and thus computations) make it infeasible to implement a prefetcher based on LSTM, as to be useful, these predictions need to be faster than accessing the sequence of memory addresses without any prefetching. Recent work [13] proposes an encoding method that reduces the size of the LSTM model to few thousands of parameters. They also show that such high compression can be achieved without any significant loss in accuracy. As a result, inference can be fast and models can be retrained quickly on demand, when there is a drastic change in access patterns. The drawback of this approach is that it requires training one model each for all applications. This is not a scalable solution as the number of applications grow, the total size of the models (storage required on the memory controller where these models will reside) grows linearly, thus defeating the purpose of having compact models. Further, such models do not apply to applications that have not been seen in training.",

Our approach relies on identifying clusters of applications that are similar, and then training a meta-model [3] for each cluster. MemMAP for high scalability (adaptability to multiple applications) and generalizability at the cost of small loss in accuracy and need for few retraining steps. Through extensive experiments on PARSEC [1] benchmark, which has diverse applications, we demonstrate that our approach leads to accurate, adaptable, and generalizable prediction access models. Using only three compact models of size 24K parameters each, we are able to perform on par with specialized models for 13 applications. We envision that in a real system implementation, the memory controller will run all three models concurrently, and use the model that produces better accuracy over last few accesses. Note that, in this paper, our objective is not to develop a full scale prefetcher, but to design a small set of highly accurate and compact LSTM based access prediction model to enable a realistic prefetcher implementation. A prefetcher built on top of our approach and its hardware implementation will be explored in future work. Specifically, our contributions are as follows:We improve upon the state-of-the-art compressed LSTM models for access predictions, eliminating its necessity of one model per application (trace);We propose a clustered meta-learning-based approach to obtain more general prediction models that can achieve high accuracy after a small number of gradient steps and can even generalize to unseen/new applications;We experimentally demonstrate that our approach is accurate, adaptable, and generalizable \u2013 with a reduced number of models, we can achieve the same level of accuracy as the specialized (one model per application) approach with a much smaller memory footprint.\n",

In [12], the authors propose the use of logistic regression, and decision tree models to enhance prefetching. The authors in [7] evaluate various machine learning models on their ability to improve prefetching for data center applications. Neural networks and decision trees where shown to achieve the highest performance in this application domain. The work in [9, 10], and [6] presents an extensive evaluation of LSTM for prefetching, achieving similar performance improvements as the other LSTM based approaches. Among the related work [5] has received significant attention. Their approach is impractical to be directly applied for prefetching, and as stated by the authors, is only a first step towards an LSTM-based prefetcher. They, and several state-of-the-art machine learning based access predictors perform the training on cache misses as it reduces the size of training. However, an accurate prefetcher will change the distribution of cache misses and hence invalidate its own trained model. Secondly, to achieve higher accuracy, some online training is necessary to learn application specific patterns. Their models are extremely large to be used for real-time inference or online retraining. Even after considering labels for predictions that cover 50% of the data (leading to a compulsory accuracy loss of 50%), the number of labels can be of the order of 10K. This, in turn, with a small hidden layer of size 100 will lead to a model with more than million parameters. Instead, we propose to use a small ensemble of highly compact LSTM models.",

We also propose a clustered meta-learning-based approach to obtain more general prediction models that can achieve comparable accuracy as previous techniques after a small number of gradient steps and can even generalize to unseen/new applications. This results in a much smaller memory footprint compared to related work, allowing its implementation in hardware.",

These factors are closely related to the size (number of parameters) of the model. As shown in [13], the size (number of parameters) of the simple LSTM model for memory access prediction is dominated by the dense last layer. Few thousands of output layers may lead to slowing down of inference due to large number of parameters in the final layer. Instead of using the deltas (jumps in memory accesses) directly as labels, the approach in [13] predicts the binary representation of deltas, converting the problem from a single label (1 out of n) prediction problem to a multi-label prediction problem (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\log n$$\\end{document} labels).

This indicates that one model may not readily apply to all applications, and instead may requires some retraining. With the goal of obtaining a general model that quickly adapts to a chosen application, we use Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning [3] that samples batches from a set of applications to train one meta-LSTM model (Algorithm 1). First, we sample a set of applications and from each we prepare a batch of memory accesses. This batch is used to calculate loss and update adapted parameters from meta-parameters. Then from this mixed set of applications, a batch is prepared to compute the loss which is used to update the meta-model parameters. At termination, a meta-model is obtained which can adapt to all the tasks used in this training with few retraining steps.\n\n",

In the experiment for pre-update models, we use 200K accesses for training and the next 200K for testing. For retraining, we use unseen 200K accesses of specific trace to retrain the existing pre-update models to get updated models for each trace.

We propose to use a clustering based meta-learning approach, where the applications are first clustered and then a meta-model is trained for each cluster. While, it is possible to train one model for all applications, the accuracy was typically lower. Our approach exploits the trade-offs between total model size, accuracy, and retraining steps. We showed that three models (with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$3\\times 24K$$\\end{document} parameters) can achieve high accuracy quickly for 13 diverse applications. We show that our approach is accurate for majority of applications in the benchmarks, it adapts quickly with retraining of only one epoch with increasing number of accesses, and it can generalize to applications that were not seen during training. In future work, we will explore other clustering approaches to identify the ideal set of meta-models, and their hardware implementation.",
