During that period, an estimated 1000 to 1200 patients with Covid-19 were admitted to these hospitals. Four of the patients in this series had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of the neurologic syndrome, and one had a negative nasopharyngeal swab and negative bronchoalveolar lavage but subsequently had a positive serologic test for the virus. Detailed case reports are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.",

Antiganglioside antibodies were absent in the three patients who were tested. In all the patients, a real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results of electrophysiological studies are shown in Table S1. Compound muscle action potential amplitudes were low but could be obtained; two patients had prolonged motor distal latencies. On electromyography, fibrillation potentials were present in three patients initially; in another patient, they were absent initially but were present at 12 days. The findings were generally consistent with an axonal variant of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in three patients and with a demyelinating process in two patients.1 Magnetic resonance imaging, performed with the administration of gadolinium, showed enhancement of the caudal nerve roots in two patients, enhancement of the facial nerve in one patient, and no signal changes in nerves in two patients. Additional laboratory findings are shown in Table S2.",

We could not determine the effect of reduced vital capacity due to neuromuscular failure from Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in these patients, but such an effect might be considered if findings on chest imaging are not commensurate with the severity of respiratory insufficiency.
