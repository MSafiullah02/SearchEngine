            "text": "Acute viral bronchiolitis is common in children aged less than two years. It is a major reason for admission to hospital, and secondary spread can lead to hospital-associated infections and outbreaks. It usually presents with cough and increased work of breathing, and often affects a child's ability to feed [1]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen detected in hospitalized children, particularly during the winter months in temperate climates. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) has traditionally been used to inform cohorting of infectious patients (i.e. to minimize secondary spread) and to aid clinical decision making (e.g. avoiding unnecessary antibiotics). However, bronchiolitis remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, and recent studies have highlighted a large number of other viral pathogens such as adenovirus, influenza virus, parechovirus, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus (RV) as pathogens associated with this clinical condition [2]. Neither the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2014) nor the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2015) guidelines recommend routine use of NPA testing for RSV in the diagnosis of infants with bronchiolitis [1], [3].",

All NPA samples were initially screened by testing for RSV using antigen detection (Binax NOW RSV card), and those that tested negative went on to have extended PCR panel testing (Figure 1\n).

The present study also found that comorbidities were more common in the RV-associated bronchiolitis group (P = 0.004). Following analysis by a logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, birth weight, presence of fever, and day of disease on admission, a Greek study found that the presence of RV was associated with more severe disease, and that this risk was approximately five-fold greater [4]. The present study found a higher morbidity rate for RV infection compared with RSV, especially for prolonged LOS (P < 0.05), as well as the need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). This trend was noted for other parameters such as need for intravenous fluids and respiratory support, although these differences did not reach statistical significance.

However, it may still be a useful adjunct in infants and young children with additional risk factors, as this and other studies have suggested an association with prolonged LOS where children are less likely to need antibiotic intervention. Also, lower respiratory tract infections caused by viral pathogens including RSV have been implicated in numerous nosocomial outbreaks, which could be missed easily, particularly if routine testing is no longer recommended and diagnosis is based on clinical presentation alone. Therefore, it remains essential that there is rapid access to screening, followed by extended PCR testing including RV should secondary cases occur in a hospital setting.",

Cross-infection may be more likely to occur in neonates who are already inpatients in the neonatal units [8]. Of note, three of 10 neonates were already being managed as inpatients in the neonatal unit when they developed bronchiolitis, and required an extended LOS because of their prematurity. The remaining five children who had LOS exceeding three weeks had ongoing health issues, including four children who developed a bronchiolitis-like illness during their inpatient stay. This suggests that cross-infection may occur readily in the hospital setting [9]. Only one case could be correlated directly with significant complications from his original bronchiolitis infection on admission.",

Children are also tested if there is any suspicion of secondary spread or outbreak occurring in an inpatient setting, or if cohorting is being considered due to lack of suitable isolation facilities. These approaches help to avoid unnecessary investigations or antibiotic treatment in this group, while minimizing the risk of further spread. However, for infants and children where NPAs are negative by the extended respiratory panel PCR, serious consideration of other primary causes of infection, including bacteria, needs to be sought and treated appropriately in keeping with managing sepsis while supporting antimicrobial stewardship.",

The study highlights the importance of considering RV as an important respiratory pathogen in infants and young children who present with bronchiolitis, particularly during the non-RSV season, which can necessitate hospitalization and therapeutic interventions, and lead to prolonged LOS. RV was found to be more common in children with pre-existing risk factors, and targeted NPA testing may be useful in selective settings. The study data further support the limited existing literature that RV may be an important causative viral pathogen in bronchiolitis. Larger multi-centre studies are required to further categorize clinicopathological outcomes in bronchiolitis caused by RSV and RV, as well as other viral pathogens.",
