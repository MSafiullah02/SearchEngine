Anyhow, the background behind the incidence and severity of COVID19 in children is not well understood. Children are usually more often affected by respiratory viral infections because of their immature immunocompetence, but this does not seem to apply to SARS-CoV-2. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this phenomenon. For instance, children might have a cross-immunity towards other coronaviruses with similarity to SARS-CoV-2. Also, the severest forms of COVID19 seen in some adult patients might be due to an uncontrolled, chaotic inflammatory host response (the so-called cytokine storm), more than to the direct viral cytopathic effect, and children may be less prone to develop this excessive host response [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "In addition to the issues described above, there are additional unknowns in pediatrics. There is very little published pediatric experience about use of experimental therapies for COVID19; therefore, we are not able to evaluate their risk/benefit ratio in this population. Related to that, we are not sure about the physiopathological mechanisms behind the relatively low incidence and severity of COVID19 in children. The available literature about pediatric COVID19 is mainly coming from China. A recent Chinese series of more than two thousand children showed that severe forms of COVID19 are more frequent in infants aged less than 12 months rather than in older children [13] . Consistently, a recent case report described a 55-day-old infant suffering from multiorgan failure due to severe COVID19 [14] . Some case series, also published outside of China, described the same age distribution and confirmed that (1) children with pre-existing comorbidities may present severe forms of the disease and (2) children and adults mostly share signs and symptoms at COVID19 onset [6] [7] [8] [14] [15] [16] . Other reports have shown that neonates born to mothers with COVID19 have clinical features compatible with those of the disease in adults and older children (such as dyspnea, fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function, vomiting) [17, 18] . A small case series suggests that children with more severe COVID19 might experience a cytokine storm similar to adult patients [19] . Even when pediatric COVID19 is just a mild disease, children may spread the virus for longer periods than adults, particularly through the oro-fecal route [20] . Italians clinicians were exposed to a significant pressure due to the epidemiological situation and proposed an algorithm for patients' isolation and de-isolation based on their age and clinical severity, although this is dictated by the public health emergency and is not evidencebased [21] . Furthermore, several alerts have been launched on the media and from some national scientific societies regarding an apparent surge in the incidence of myocarditis and Kawasaki disease and one case has been recently reported [22] . The situation is extremely evolutive, and the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and these clinical manifestations deserves urgent investigation. Thus, many clinical questions remain unanswered: a better understanding of COVID19 physiopathology might eventually be useful also for the management of adult patients.",

Pregnant women may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and eventually develop COVID19 at different times during their pregnancy [23] . Available data seem to suggest that COVID19 is less severe during pregnancy, and this could be linked to the relative maternal immunodeficiency which leads to \"tolerance\" of the fetus, and which might prevent the cytokine storm and the development of severe infection and respiratory failure [23] . However, examples of pregnant women with ARDS needing mechanical ventilation have been observed (De Luca, Personal communications March/April 2020), although not yet fully described in scientific publications. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems uncommon but possible. A first case series seemed to exclude it [24] ; however, other reports have demonstrated (1) neonatal complications and clinical symptoms similar to those of COVID19 in adults [17] ; (2) neonatal infection by detecting IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or viral genome by real timepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [25] [26] [27] ; and (3) the existence of neonatal congenital pneumonia in neonates positive for SARS-CoV-2 who were born to mothers with COVID19 [28] . Some other cases of neonatal infection have been reported by the media in Italy (and then in other Countries), although it is not clear if these babies were infected vertically or by environmental exposure (https://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid= mm6912e2_w)",

In fact, only six breast milk samples have been analyzed with RT-PCR so far, and been shown to be negative for COVID19 [24] . RT-PCR false negative may account for up to 30% of tests [29] , and this, together with the very small sample size, does not allow us to draw any conclusion. The Chinese Center for Disease Control [30] and experts' consensus [31] recommend against breastfeeding and advise separation of the mother and her baby for 14 days. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also states that clinicians should consider temporarily separating (e.g., separate rooms) the mother from her baby until the mother's transmissionbased precautions are discontinued, and to use expressed breast milk for bottle feeding, rather than direct breastfeeding (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2. htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w). The American Academy of Pediatrics is considering these issues, but has not yet released an official position (https://www.aappublications. org/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus031220), while a number of other scientific societies and bodies more optimistically recommend to breastfeed. Other \u03b2-coronaviruses, and particularly the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, which shares more than 50% of genetic sequence and several biological characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 [32] , are known to be transmitted through breast milk in animals [33] [34] [35] [36] . We clearly need more data, based on welldesigned, large studies analyzing breast milk samples obtained in different phases of COVID19 disease to clarify if the virus is present and transmittable and if there are any antibodies secreted in the milk.",

The specific accuracy of RT-PCR in children is not known, and we need to clarify the role of other tests. The detection of antibodies would be particularly useful to screen and diagnose the vertical transmission from mother to the fetus and the neonate, but also to study the immunity and eventually understand better the biological mechanism behind pediatric COVID19. Recently, several kits have been designed to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and some of them also represent pointof-care assays with rapid turnaround [38] .

Theoretically, neonates and children might have severe forms of COVID19 needing intensive care support of vital functions, and the case series described above demonstrate that this scenario does occur, but is infrequent. There is likely to be a publication bias due to the extreme work overload of clinicians who are not able to publish their experience: ARDS and other organ failures due to COVID19 in children have been observed (Tissieres, personal communication March/April 2020), but these remain unpublished personal observations. ARDS in children and in neonates has been recently defined using age-specific definitions which also allow us to stratify their clinical severity [39] [40] [41] . These definitions are useful for clinicians, at least for the diagnosis and clinical follow-up of these patients; however, their critical care is essentially based on the experience accumulated in the field of COVID19 adult care. The European Society for Intensive Care Medicine and the European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) have organized serial webinars to share this experience (https://www.esicm.org/ resources/coronavirus-public-health-emergency/# WEBINARS, https://espnic-online.org/COVID-19-Outbreak/ ESPNIC-Webinars). The use of steroids or other immunomodulating agents to attenuate the cytokine storm in severe COVID19 infection may be considered, based on recent encouraging results obtained in adults [42] . Similarly, there have been announcements of trial results showing encouraging results for antiviral therapy with remdesivir (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trialshows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid- 19) and for tocilizumab to modulate the host immune response in adults (https://www.aphp.fr/contenu/tocilizumab-improvessignificantly-clinical-outcomes-patients-moderate-or-severecovid-19).",

However, even within these consensus documents there are many open questions and grey areas. Moreover, there are also doubts about issues specifically related to COVID19 critical care, such as the safety to healthcare workers and clinical efficacy of non-invasive ventilation and heated humidified high flow nasal cannula, or the timing to start invasive ventilation or extra-corporeal life support. The use of ancillary respiratory therapy (e.g., surfactant, nitric oxide, other pulmonary vasodilators) is also unclear and requires a case-by-case evaluation based on clinical and physiological details. Thus, there are several open questions for ARDS in children and in neonates in general, but even more for those induced by COVID19, given the lack of experience about this disease. COVID19 has the merit to have heightened the attention on these issues and hopefully will push research to address these unmet clinical needs.",

We do not know yet what is the suitability and usefulness of these initiatives. However, certainly the need to support adult critical care clinicians and to gain new competences in a relatively short time, together with the lack of critical care resources, may open important ethical dilemmas. These are currently being discussed within the ESPNIC Section on Ethics. This is surely only one of many ethical problems related to pediatrics during the COVID19 era as many others may arise, from resource allocation, to patients' triage and to the recent call for an end to the US President Donald Trump's ban on fetal-tissue research (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00154-w).",

Because of this and the wide diffusion of the outbreak, it is evident that we need special initiatives to increase our knowledge in the field, to answer the unmet clinical and research needs and to maximize our response. The numerical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children and neonates is lower than in adults, as pediatric COVID19 disease seems to account for only 1-5% of all described cases [45] . Thus, any project in this area should have a multicenter design in order to achieve a sufficient statistical power and describe accurately and pragmatically the clinical issues during this medical catastrophe.",

For practical and academic purposes, EPICENTRE is subdivided in two similar but distinct data sets: one for neonates (i.e., for infections occurring in the first 30 days of life and for neonates born to infected mothers) and one for children (i.e., for infections occurring beyond the first 30 days of life).

The clinical care is provided according to local protocols, and there will be no changes solely for study purposes. When a particular item is unavailable, the related field will be left empty.

Collaborating national scientific societies and networks also contributed to advertise EPICENTRE, and thanks to this effort, about 100 centers around the world have joined or expressed willingness to join the network as per May 3, 2020. Similar to all epidemiological and observational studies, EPICENTRE will have some limitations. For example, the design aims to be comprehensive and pragmatic, but some geographical areas may not be covered by EPICENTRE network as the project may not be feasible for technical or administrative reasons. To mitigate this, we have corresponded with other local/national registries to ensure data fields match as closely as possible. This will allow the potential to merge data later to answer specific research questions. There needs to be a balance between detail of data included, such as physiological data, biosamples, and public health data linkage, and the ability of healthcare systems to manage accurate data entry during a pandemic. We have attempted to find a practical and pragmatic solution to these conflicting needs but acknowledge that this comes at the expense of scope. In most regions, local authorities have established large-scale data linkage, but without the detail on critical care needs in children. If possible, we may be able to utilize these resources in the future. Finally, the need to be hospitalized in an intensive/critical care setting for children beyond neonatal age may be dependent on the local setting/protocols and availability of critical care facilities. However, this is a common problem of pragmatic study design and is generally appropriate when refinements of current care are investigated [47] .",
