The majority (88.8%, n = 32) of the cancelled visits were so due to government indication to prevent any potentially avoidable contact of patients with hospitals, and therefore, nonurgent visits were cancelled and rescheduled by hospital personnel, while in 11.2% of cases (n = 4), the visits were cancelled by the patients themselves because of fears related to COVID\u201019 infection. Among the 48 patients who presented for their scheduled visit, 15 (31.2%) were on immunosuppressant drugs, and overall, none of the 48 patients reported symptoms suggestive of COVID\u201019 infection. Noteworthy, the number of email messages received at the dedicated email inbox of the centre progressively increased, up to 17 daily email messages, with a mean of 7 messages per working day. Indeed, the total number of email messages in the 3\u2010week period of interest was 102, with 24 messages sent by patients treated with biological or immunosuppressive drugs, of whom 18 (75.0%) had COVID\u201019 as object, while 78 email messages were from patients with IBD not receiving any immunosuppressive therapy, and only 13 of them (16.7%) with a request of information on COVID\u201019 and IBD as object (P < .0001). In comparison, in the 3\u2010week period preceding 21 February 2020\u2014despite the epidemic of COVID\u201019 was by large renowned in the public, and isolated cases had already appeared in Italy\u2014we received a total of 42 email messages (\u221259%), with a mean of 3 email messages per working day: 17 and 25 messages were from patients on immunosuppressive or biological drugs or on standard medications, respectively, and none of them contained any reference to COVID\u201019 (Figure 1). Since the beginning of the COVID\u201019 epidemic in our country, 2 patients autonomously decided to discontinue treatment with a biological drug, while in 2 patients, the decision to delay initiation of immunosuppressant therapy was agreed upon by physicians and patients following concerns of the latter regarding the beginning of treatment in this period. Lastly, in one patient, a postponement in dose intensification of a biological drug was decided by the physician in charge of the patient after having carefully balanced the risks associated with activity of the IBD and those related to the increase in the number of visits to the hospital to receive drug infusions and more frequent controls.",

We feel that in this time and age of great concerns regarding the health and economic fallout of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, every effort should be pursued by specialised centres caring for patients with IBD, and we have observed that with adequate counselling and telematics tools to provide patients with prompt and reliable answers, only 2 of the 107 patients on biological drugs withdrew treatment (1.9%), and none of the patients on clinical trials or on antimetabolites. However, we also feel that in this moment in history, every effort should be put in place in order to facilitate patients\u2019 compliance with both ordinary care and more complex treatment for IBD, by stratifying patients considering age, comorbidities and disease activity, enhancing telemedicine use for fragile patients or those in remission, improving home delivery of medicines and, when possible, adequate facilities for infusions of biological or experimental drugs for patients with moderate\u2010severe activity of disease.",
