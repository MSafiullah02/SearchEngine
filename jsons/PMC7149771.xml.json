            "text": "Signs of neurological dysfunction dictate the neuroanatomical localization of a lesion within the spinal cord. Spinal reflexes and paraspinal hyperesthesia assist with lesion localization. Localization is specified to the spinal cord regions C1-C5, C6-T2, T3-L3, and L4-S2, based on upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron signs of limb weakness. Cats with spinal cord compressive disease or meningomyelitis often exhibit paraspinal hyperesthesia. Pathology of the spinal cord tissue itself usually does not have hyperesthesia as a clinical sign. Orthopedic, polyneuropathic, myopathic, and neuromuscular junction disorders can mimic signs of spinal cord dysfunction. Careful interpretation of the neurological examination differentiates among these disorders (see Chapter 49).",

History is important for determining temporal onset (acute, insidious, or episodic) and progression (rapid, gradual, or static).

Routine laboratory testing consists of a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile to include creatine phosphokinase (CK) enzyme activity, and urinalysis. Evaluation of CK activity aids in identification of a myopathy, which can mimic spinal cord dysfunction. Patient infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) must be identified.

Isotonic crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9 per cent sodium chloride) at shock doses, initially (60 ml/kg/hr IV in cats) are given to effect until heart rate, capillary refill time, and pulse quality improve. Hetastarch (6 per cent) is a large molecular weight colloid that consists of a branched polysaccharide, amylopectin. Its molecular properties provide a long intravascular half-life. The dose is 10 to 20 ml/kg given to effect up to 40 ml/kg/hr. Hetastarch is administered intravenously to cats to effect up to 10 to 15 ml/kg; the dose is increased in 5 ml/kg increments every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid nausea and vomiting. Hypertonic saline (7 per cent) also may be used to expand blood volume quickly. The dose (4 to 5 ml/kg) is administered as an intravenous bolus over 3 to 5 minutes. The disadvantage associated with the use of hypertonic saline is that it remains in the vascular space for only 15 to 60 minutes. Blood products also are used to expand volume and provide increased oxygen delivery. Whole blood is administered intravenously at a dose of 4 to 10 ml/kg/hr, over 4 to 6 hours in stable patients and faster in unstable patients.

The intent of high-dose MPSS is to provide adequate tissue concentrations of steroid at the site of injury. The original dose for this regimen was 30 mg/kg IV initially, then a dose of 15 mg/kg given 2 and 6 hours later, followed immediately by a 2.5 mg/kg/hr infusion, which is continued for 42 hours. The total dose of MPSS administered is 165 mg/kg.43 Recent prospective clinical studies that have used modifications of this protocol have come under intense scrutiny for various reasons, including statistical manipulation, lack of proven efficacy, and increased rates of complications in human beings and dogs.50, 51, 52, 53, 54 Administration of MPSS is time dependent and has shown efficacy if administered within 30 minutes of the injury.55 Use of high-dose MPSS is not recommended for administration if the time has been longer than 8 hours after sustaining the injury.",

Suggestions for care to prevent this problem include adequate bladder expression and water intake.70 Chronic bladder infections weaken the muscular wall, further complicating manual emptying of the bladder.70 Fecal elimination usually can occur without assistance and is aided by perineal stimulation.70 Diarrhea and constipation still can occur as complications.",
