The virus is spread worldwide and is commonly transmitted from person to person by direct contact, e.g., with skin rash or by inhalation of aerosolized droplets from respiratory tract secretions of patients with chickenpox [2]. Rarely, the infection is spread by the inhalation of aerosolized droplets from vesicular fluid of skin lesions of patients with chickenpox or disseminated herpes zoster (HZ) [2]. After primary infection, VZV remains latent in the sensory nerve ganglia and can reactivate later in life, causing HZ [2].",

Three out of 19 patients developed the most dangerous complication of chickenpox such as pneumonia [21]. The second study, carried out in Scotland from 1981 to 1998, reported an overall incidence of chickenpox in pregnant women of 0.38 per 1000 live births [22]. The last study was performed in a large cohort of pregnant women (7.7 million) from the United States (US) and reported an incidence of 1.21 cases/10,000 pregnancy admissions. In this cohort, incidence of chickenpox pneumonia was 2.5 and 0.3% of patients experienced ARDS requiring ventilation but with no maternal deaths [23].

Also, the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus/newborn during the intrauterine stage (congenital infection), during labor (perinatal infection), or after birth (postnatal infection) has been reported [35]. The rate of vertical transmission is about 25% before 20 week gestation [36]. The offspring infection can result in fetal death, abortion, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and different defects, already evident at birth or, more frequently, occurring as sequelae [34, 37, 38]. The incidence of congenital infection is overall 0.91%, with rates ranging from 0.55 during the first trimester to 1.4 during the second one, and during the third trimester is virtually absent [39, 40].",
