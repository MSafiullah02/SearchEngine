It is one of the leading causes of maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality worldwide. The integration of microarrays and sophisticated bioinformatics can provide specific and efficient high-throughput screening with which to investigate the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Although the mechanisms have been elusive, new physiologic insights have begun to alter thinking about preeclampsia [1]. Angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of endothelial cell function [2\u20135]. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng) are endogenous anti-angiogenic proteins that neutralize the pro-angiogenic proteins VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF). Maternal endothelial dysfunction, possibly related to these circulating factors, is a key feature of this syndrome.",

A recent study has shown a crucial link between the development of preeclampsia and defense against both exogenous ligands (foreign pathogens) and endogenously generated alarmins [6]. Women with preeclampsia had increased expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein, a downstream transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and interleukin (IL)-1beta mRNA compared with control groups [8]. Thus, TLRs may modulate the innate immune response and appear to be factors contributing to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [8].",

A computerized literature search was performed to identify relevant studies reported in the English language.

Additionally, references in each article were searched to identify potentially missed studies for a 20-year period (1990\u20132010). Target publications are mainly reports on human preeclampsia and mouse models, as well as studies in gene and protein expression systems. A priori, case reports, and abstracts were not included, since abstracts do not undergo a stringent peer-review process. A difficulty in interpreting the literature is that analyses, results and objects (early onset or late onset) are reported differently among the studies.

Preeclamptic placenta is relatively ischemic and produces a variety of factors that might generate profound effects on vascular endothelial cell function [10]. These factors include the soluble VEGF receptor-1 (VEGF-RI, also known as Flt-1), the angiotensin II type-1 receptor autoantibody, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6. The angiogenic activity of VEGF is mainly mediated by VEGF receptor I (Flt-1) and VEGF receptor II [VEGF-RII; also known as Flk-1 (fetal liver kinase 1)/KDR (kinase domain region)]. VEGF expression is primarily regulated by hypoxia [11]. Ischemic placenta also generates sFlt-1, possibly via hypoxia-inducible factor signaling. Circulating mononuclear cells also represent an additional source for circulating sFlt-1 during normal and preeclamptic pregnancies [12]. A recent study has shown decreased production of VEGF by circulating T and natural killer cells in preeclampsia [13]. In the sera of pregnant women with preeclampsia, there was a significant reduction in the levels of free VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF), whereas the levels of sFlt-1 were significantly higher than those in the sera of normotensive pregnant women [14]. sFlt-1 acts as a negative modulator for the bioavailability of VEGF [15]. These soluble receptors may bind and neutralize VEGF in the maternal circulation, causing endothelial dysfunction [14]. sFlt-1 also induces endothelial cell apoptosis, and decreases nitric oxide (NO) generation in vitro [16].",

In addition to elevated angiotensin II levels, angiotensinogen and angiotensin I receptor mRNAs were also increased in preeclamptic placenta [19]. Furthermore, immunoglobulin (Ig) G autoantibody in the serum of preeclamptic women stimulates the angiotensin II type 1 receptor [20]. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor autoantibody can also induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase [19].

The previous studies showed that acute infusions of VEGF cause vasodilation and hypotension [3, 24]. VEGF plays a critical role in blood pressure control and in optimizing blood flow, vascular integrity, and tone by promoting NO activity [2] through VEGFR2-dependent up-regulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression [25]. NO has multiple functions in the vasculature, including vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities [26]. NO also prevents proliferation of excess endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as macrophage adhesion and infiltration [26]. Collectively, these studies suggest a protective role for VEGF in the development of preeclampsia, possibly with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative effects in the vasculature, which may contribute to the prevention of this hypertensive condition.",

The production of reactive oxygen intermediates in endothelial cells is induced by Th1 cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Chronic subclinical oxidative stresses may also increase maternal and fetal pro-inflammatory cytokines to levels high enough to affect vascular endothelial function. It has recently been reported that healthy pregnant women showed a decrease in IL-17-producing cells, whereas a relative increase in IL-17-producing cells and low T-regulatory cell numbers were observed in preeclamptic women, suggesting that the pathophysiology of preeclampsia might be associated with imbalanced differentiation of T-regulatory cells and Th17 cells [29, 30].

The synthesis of NO is blocked by inhibition of the NOS active site with guanidino-substituted analogues of l-arginine, such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) [29]. Therefore, ADMA acts as an endogenous NOS inhibitor [32, 33]. The administration of ADMA in rats causes an increase in renal vascular resistance and blood pressure [34], confirming its biological action in vivo. Interestingly, a more recent report showed that maternal concentrations of ADMA are higher in mid-pregnancy in women who experience preeclampsia, compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies [35]. Investigators have studied other promising markers that have been identified up to now, including placental protein 13 (PP13), P-selectin, a disintegrin and metalloprotease-12 (ADAM12), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and adrenomedullin[36, 37]. These markers appear to be promising tools, most likely in a combinatorial analysis, to diagnose, predict outcome, and monitor this disorder [36, 37].",

Preeclampsia in particular has gene-expression signatures associated with imbalance of oxidative stress generation and detoxification pathways. In a suggested hypothetical event, the link between angiogenesis and cytokine could be provided through oxidative stress by excessive production of ROS. Taken together, placental hypoxia and reoxygenation might induce oxidative stress, which stimulates placental synthesis of cytokines, maternal leukocyte activation, leukocyte/endothelial interaction, immune response regulation and generalized endothelial dysfunction, thereby completing a vicious cycle [44]. These data allow us to speculate that the first subclinical stage has a \u201cstress-resistant\u201d phenotype.",

TLRs recognize infectious agents (foreign pathogens, exogenous ligands) and other danger signals [endogenously generated inflammatory ligands, also known as alarmins (see above)]. TLR-dependent innate immunity plays a role as the first line of host defense. Activation of TLRs on trophoblast cells influences immune cell recruitment, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and decidual responses to invading pathogens during pregnancy [48]. Importantly, recent data directly implicate signaling by TLRs at multiple maternal\u2013fetal interfaces in the pathogenesis of several pregnancy pathologies, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm labor [48]. Although the participation of the innate immune responses in sustaining the inflammation needs further investigation, preeclampsia is characterized as being a state of persistent inflammation. Animal models for preeclampsia are furthering our understanding of pathophysiology: TLR3 responds to double strand (ds) RNA from viruses, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells. Persistent TLR3 activation during pregnancy causes hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, proteinuria, and intrauterine growth restriction in normal pregnant rats [49]. TLR stimulation of trophoblast cells induces inflammatory mediator production and, in particular, secretion of anti-angiogenic factor sFlt-1 [50]. Exogenous ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) itself can also induce sFlt-1 expression in macrophages through protein kinase C signaling [51, 52]. Persistent activation of TLRs might therefore be associated with the development of preeclampsia.",

In addition to AGEs, RAGE binds certain members of the S100/calgranulin family (such as S100A12 and S100B), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), transthyretin (TTR), Mac-1, and amphoterin [56]. RAGE is expressed on multiple cell types, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, glomerular epithelial cells, podocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and transformed cells [56]. RAGE activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase, an important source of oxidative stress, and generates ROS [56]. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is a downstream target of RAGE-mediated cellular activation. NF-kappaB activation also leads to increased RAGE expression. Thus, the AGE\u2013RAGE system, which is up-regulated in preeclampsia, is likely to be involved in ROS-induced oxidative stress and might contribute to vascular dysfunction in preeclampsia [57, 58]. Accumulation of markers of oxidative stress such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine indicated enhanced oxidative modifications of lipids and DNA in preeclamptic placenta [57].

AGEs are heterogeneous in structure, which implies that many products could be measured to estimate formation of AGEs. Of them, pentosidine and carboxymethyl-lysine have been the best characterized [67]. It has been established that AGEs are directly implicated in the development of chronic complications in diabetes [68]. Similar to diabetes, the mean level of serum AGEs in preeclamptic women was higher than those in healthy non-pregnant women or healthy pregnant women [57]. Tsukahara et al. [69] showed that umbilical blood concentrations of pentosidine are high in the maternal preeclamptic condition. Thus, preeclampsia is thought to be complicated with formation and production of AGEs.

In addition, sFlt-1, sEng, and angiotensin-II receptor autoantibody may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. These potential markers have been implicated in the regulation of vascular endothelial function. The persistent inflammatory response plays an important role in coordinating the global transcriptional regulation leading to the functional switch from the \u201cstress-resistant\u201d response to the \u201cstress-sensitive\u201d phenotype: the loss of angiogenic functions and the rise in PRRs.
