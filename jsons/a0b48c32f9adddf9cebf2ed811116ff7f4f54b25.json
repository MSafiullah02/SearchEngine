Thanks to effective prevention and control measures implemented during the first 50 days in China [17] ,the basic reproduction number (R0) of the SARS-CoV-2 has been suppressed from 3.15 on January 23 to 0.04, preventing at least 700 000 cases outside Wuhan. COVID-19 occurred during the peak season for other viral respiratory infections, including viral pneumonia [18] . Therefore, it is important to distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. In this study, we analysed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia treated at our hospital during a single period and found that all 23 COVID-19 cases were imported cases. At the initial visit, only 69.57% of the patients had fever, and approximately one-third had no fever. Nucleic acid test results may be positive before symptoms appear [19] , posing a great challenge for the early detection of imported COVID-19. Dry cough is a typical symptom of COVID-19, which should be noted during inquiry to prevent missed diagnoses. Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 were more common in middle-aged adults, as the mean age was 45 in the COVID-19 group and 53 in the non-COVID-19 group. In both groups, two-thirds of the patients were men. These data are consistent with those of large clinical studies [12, 20] . In addition, most COVID-19 patients (91.30%) had a history of travelling to or from Wuhan or contact with individuals from Wuhan [21] , while non-COVID-19 patients had no clear history of contact. COVID-19 patients were younger with fewer underlying diseases, while non-COVID-19 patients were older with more underlying diseases (such as cerebrovascular disease, organ transplant, haematological tumour, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatic disease, diabetes, and immunodeficiency), more severe conditions, a higher ICU admission rate, and higher 28-day mortality (Table1). The 28-day survival rate was higher in the COVID-19 group (Figure2). COVID-19 was more likely to affect T cell immunity, resulting in .

This study showed that clinical symptoms and blood test may provide important clues. No significant between-group difference was observed in fever, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, platelet count, or kidney function. In addition to dry cough, COVID-19 was characterized by lower WBC, neutrophil count and percentage, and lymphocyte count and percentage, which, combined with the history of exposure to individuals from Hubei and positive nucleic acid test results, may help diagnose COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, chest CT showed the following characteristics: 1) in most cases, CT showed typical visceral pleural inflammatory exudate on days 5-7 of onset (Figure 2A , day 6 of onset, 'inflammation line', yellow arrow); 2) typical CT findings included multiple hazy, patchy ground glass opacities near the visceral pleura in the middle and lower lobes ( Figure 2B , day 10 of onset, red arrow); 3) in mild cases, CT showed small, patchy ground glass opacities without clear boundaries ( Figure 2C , day 2 of onset, red arrow);4)in severe cases, chest CT showed bilateral multiple large, patchy ground glass opacities with consolidation ( Figure 2D , day 8 of onset, red arrow). Non-COVID-19 was associated with different time of onset, disease course, disease severities, and chest CT findings. In rhinovirus infection combined with influenza B pneumonia, CT showed bilateral scattered patchy opacities and parenchymal bands with bronchiectasis ( Figure 2E , day 14 of onset, red arrow). Cytomegalovirus infection combined with fungal, bacterial, or pneumocystis pneumoniais usually seen after organ (Kidney) transplant; in our cytomegalovirus patients, chest CT showed bilateral scattered ground glass opacities with interstitial consolidation ( Figure 2F , day 14 of onset, red arrow). In severe influenza A pneumonia, CT showed bilateral diffuse bronchial thickening, with parenchymal bands and consolidation around the bronchi ( Figure 2G , day 8 of onset, red arrow). In severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia with rheumatoid arthritis, chest CT showed multiple patchy opacities, parenchymal bands, ground glass opacities, consolidation, reticular markings, and interstitial fibrosisin both lungs ( Figure 2H , day 10 of onset, red arrow). These characteristics help distinguish COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

First, this was a retrospective study with a short observation time, so the level of evidence was lower than that of prospective randomized controlled trials. Second, the sample size was small, with only 23 COVID-19 cases, furthermore, most of which were mild, and only three patients were admitted to ICU according to our protocol [27] . Non-COVID-19 patients were older with more underlying diseases, which were more critical. 12 of whom were admitted to ICU. The 28-day mortality rate of non-COVID-19 patients was higher than that of COVID-19 patients, and the 28-day survival rate of non-COVID-19 patients was lower than that of COVID-19 patients. Third, no effective treatment is available for COVID-19. We followed the guidelines [28] and administered oxygen therapy, oxygen atomization and humidification, antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, Arbidol, interferon nasal spray), ambroxol (to break up phlegm), acetylcysteine (Fluimucil, to prevent pulmonary fibrosis), and live combined Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus tablets (to supplement intestinal probiotics), as well as \u03b1 -thymosinfor supportive symptomatic treatment in the case of decreased Tlymphocytes. Other than traditional Chinese medicine (oral or via a nasal tube), the treatment protocol lacks specifics. Lastly, prospective studies are needed to validate our results.",
