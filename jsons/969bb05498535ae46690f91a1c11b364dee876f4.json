The lipids were insoluble in aqueous systems compatible with cell cultures, and organic solvents for lipids were highly toxic to the cells. Attempts to minimize the use of solvents by adding EDTA, Ficoll, Cab-0-Sil, and other stabilizers were not pursued beyond some initial unrewarding experiments. Ether, chloroform, etha nol, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were effective solvents for the monolaurin compounds, and benzene, propylene glycol, ethylene glycc and glycerol were not, at least in terms of obtaining 10% or greater solutions. Of the four effective solvents, ether and chloroform have low solubilities in water at 25\u00b0C (6.05 and 0.596, respectively) and thus formed emulsions when mixed with cell culture fluids. DMSO has a hig solubility but still produced viscous suspensions when DMSO plus test substance was mixed with culture media. Ethanol is completely miscib with water, was no more toxic than the other solvents to cell cultures, and produced more manageable suspensions when ethanol plus test sul stance was mixed with culture media. Thus ethanol became the solvenf of choice in this study.",

Final concentrations of 20.05% monolaurin (500 pg/ml) also were toxic for all cells, and the toxicity was additive with that of the solvent. Carefully controlled test mixture were evolved which minimized the toxic effects of the test substance and solvent while maximizing the virucidal effects of the test substanci Table 2 shows the virucidal effect of increasing concentrations of monolaurin on herpes 1 virus after the samples were mixed for 1 h at 23\u00b0C and then titrated. None of these samples were toxic at the first dilution tested. The rate of killing was not measured because the same virus titers were obtained after 15 min of incubation as were obtained at 1 h, and because of the time required t o titrate the virus, the experi. ment could not be performed in less time. A log-log plot of monolaurii concentration versus infectivity titer shows a nonlinear relationship (Fig. l) , with the greatest degree of killing between 0.1 and 1% monolaurin (1000 and 10,000 pg/ml). The procedure finally adopted for the in vitro virucidal studies was as follows. A solution of 20% test substance in 100% ethanol was made as a stock reagent and was presumed to be effectively sterile. A 1:lO dilution of the stock was then made in HBSS to make a working reagent compatible with cell culture media. This solution, now containing 2% test substance and 10% ethanol, was mixed with an equal volume of a virus stock and allowed to react for 1 h at 23OC with occasional agitation. The mixture was then serially diluted from lo-' to lo-' in HBSS and inoculated at 0.1 ml per tube into the cell culture appropriate for each particular virus. Each tube contained 0.9 ml of maintenance medium to feed the cell monolayer. Thus the highest final concentrations in the inoculated cell culture tubes were 0.01% test substance (100 pglml) and 0.05% ethanol (500 pg/ml) (in the lo-' dilution of the reaction mixture); these levels were not toxic for any of the cells.",
