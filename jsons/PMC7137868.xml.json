All these types of indicators have important uses in different contexts. Part of the challenge in assessment of indicators is to understand at what level they will be used. At the highest level, such as the MDG indicators, the audience is extremely broad including the technical community, governments, and the general public.",

Many health outcomes are of public-health importance, but because health problems are changing with new challenges, such as the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in developing countries and emergence of pandemic influenza, assessment of public-health significance must be regularly revisited. Coverage of interventions is also important because only through the delivery of effective interventions to those in need can health outcomes be improved. Finally, risk factors, such as tobacco consumption, can be so strongly linked to health outcomes that they are effectively measures of future health outcomes in themselves. Not all outcomes or all intervention-coverage indicators will meet a public-health importance criterion.",

The analysis in table 1, including data availability for each indicator, is strictly based on the official UN MDG website;12 there could well be other surveys and analyses that are not used for MDG monitoring. The 45 indicators in the table could probably be decreased to 16 that have high public-health importance and contribute unique information. For example, for a set of priority indicators, overall coverage of clean water is probably enough instead of urban and rural breakdowns. Arguably, urban and rural breakdowns do not provide a deep insight into differences in clean water inequalities across countries. A more useful indicator for this comparison might be the amount of clean water coverage in the bottom wealth quintile.",

Use of partial or proxy measures runs the danger that they slowly become the de facto quantity of interest in policy debates, distracting attention from the original objective of a policy or programme.

Compared with this standard, measurement of only one intervention, measles immunisation in the MDGs, is capturing less than 5% of what can be delivered. If only one intervention is to be measured, preference should be given to the intervention that would have the biggest effect on the outcome if delivered. Because intervention coverage indicators have the potential to drive managerial attention and resource allocation, claims that part indicators such as measles immunisation are good proxies for the rest of child survival interventions are unproven. The potential for indicator-driven policy also argues for the use of composites capturing the coverage of a set of interventions targeting a health problem.",

Ideally, the total inequality of a health indicator across the population could be measured.16 Total inequality can be thought of as between-group inequality plus within-group inequality.17 For many indicators, however, only between-group inequality can be readily measured. The choice of groups for indicator disaggregation, such as rich and poor, urban and rural, occupation, race, or ethnic origin could profoundly change the comparisons of inequality across populations or over time. The disaggregation of an indicator that is proposed for monitoring inequalities should accord with evidence that this disaggregation captures the largest fraction of variance in the indicator across the populations being analysed.",

The first is forecasting, whereby a relation is established during a period of observation and then used to predict out of time into the future. A common use of forecasting is to update corrected statistics to a more recent period to produce series of comparable statistics for a base year, such as the MDG indicator data on maternal mortality ratio in 2000, or many statistics in the MDG database for indoor air pollution, water supply, or tuberculosis prevalence. Predictions are also frequently used to generate figures in settings where no primary data and thus no corrected statistics are available. Since the methods are identical to those for forecasting, prediction out of sample but in the same time period has been termed farcasting. An example of farcasting is MDG estimates of solid fuel use that have been based for many countries on models relating solid fuel use to GDP per capita in those countries with data. Predicted statistics have uncertainty resulting from model choice and parameter and unexplained variance in the model.",

For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on levels of obesity by state with self-reported weights and heights in the behavioural risk factor surveillance system survey, which are known to underestimate obesity by roughly 50%.20 By reporting crude statistics, the onus for correction of known bias to allow for interpretation is shifted to the user. Although this approach makes the task easier for the data generator, it is predicated on a strange premise: the users, including policymakers and the concerned public, are in a better position to adjust for known bias than is the health statistician.

Imagine enrolling your child in a school, which then hands you the results of your child's examination scores for the end of the year on the first day of attendance.

First, several countries in greatest need will have little or no data to report, and if no statistics are reported the topic will lose policy attention. Second, worldwide advocacy needs information on global monitoring. Although the use of predicted statistics to bring attention to a difficulty seems warranted both nationally and internationally, the temptation to use such information once produced for actual monitoring and even assessment is very great. I believe that if predicted statistics are to be used in such cases, the user must make it very clear that predicted statistics are being used and this use should not become a routine activity. Therefore, publication of databases of annual predicted figures, such as for some MDG indicators, does not seem justified. Reported indicator series should, at an absolute minimum, indicate whether figures are based on crude, corrected, or predicted values. Regional or worldwide aggregates are often based on mixtures of crude, corrected, and predicted data, and the relative proportion of the component national figure based on these three types should be shown to the user.",

An explicit data audit trail would allow health statistics to be subject to the scientific principle of replication. A sceptical user should be able to reproduce every figure including all steps along the way. Decision makers, the media, or the public are unlikely to use the explicit data audit trail, but the requirement to publish this trail will over time lead to improved practice.

Once individual identifiers such as names and addresses have been removed from survey, census, or vital registration data, privacy concerns revolve around the possibility that, with some investigation, individuals could be identified.43 For example, perhaps only one 84-year-old woman died in Omaha county, USA, so that the analyst could with further investigation find the name of this individual and what she died of. Such a hypothetical possibility must be balanced against the damage to the community by suppression of health information that could improve population health.

            "text": "The MDG health-related indicators have been used to draw attention to many of the points in this paper. Overall, the set of indicators, the measurement strategies, and the implementation of the MDG health-related indicators is very poor. At least half the indicators are not of high enough public-health importance to warrant major international attention or investments in their assessment. Data availability for developing countries overall is 15%, and even in 2000 when a special effort was made, it reached 44%. Most of these figures are predicted statistics that do not provide a reasonable basis for monitoring progress. The dilemma is that data systems and measurements are so weak that only undernutrition, child mortality, measles immunisation, and attended deliveries have effective measurement strategies in place. WHO, UNICEF, UNAIDS, and other agencies responsible for monitoring the MDGs rely on using predicted statistics for most other indicators so that attention on the MDGs does not fade. Predicted statistics are a reasonable approach for identification of difficulties and for stimulation of policy interest. However, the worldwide community is failing in implementation of viable measurement strategies for real monitoring.",
