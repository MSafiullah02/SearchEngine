            "text": "Critically ill trauma patients are frequently transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs), either as an initial resuscitative measure or in response to anemia in the post-injury period [1, 2]. Blood transfusion in trauma patients has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, and infection regardless of degree of shock [3, 4]. Allogeneic blood transfusion also is associated with numerous additional side-effects to include febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), viral transmission (cytomegalovirus [CMV], human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis), and transfusion-related immunomodulation [5\u201312]. Donor leukocytes present in the allogeneic blood have been implicated as a potential cause of these complications. Proposed mechanisms include induction of T-cell anergy in the recipient, decreased natural killer cell function, altered ratio of T helper to T suppressor cells, and soluble pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by leukocytes during storage [13\u201315]. Together, these effects can suppress the recipient immune system and promote a worse pro-inflammatory state leading to increased infection and complications [16]. This has led many investigators to suggest that the use of pre-storage leukoreduced (LR) blood may mitigate some of the immunomodulatory effects of allogeneic blood transfusion and reduce associated morbidity and mortality [6, 17\u201321].",

The results of these trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in length of hospital stay by some, or a reduced infection rate, or no difference at all between groups. This led to the publication of two meta-analyses, both of which concluded that the use of LR blood might reduce postoperative infection and that mortality is reduced, but only in cardiac surgery patients [27, 28]. Interpretation of these studies has been hampered by the heterogeneous nature of the study populations, the methods of leukoreduction employed, and differences in transfusion practices [29].",

This study has been criticized for a small study population. Given the heterogeneous results seen among various patient populations and the limited data available concerning trauma patients, we examined the effects of preferential transfusion of LR blood over NLR blood on infection, organ failure, length of stay, and mortality in trauma patients. We hypothesized that the use of LR blood would not reduce the incidence of morbidity or mortality following trauma.",

Between August 2002 and August 2003, the Red Cross supplied our hospital with only LR blood. Prior to that time, our hospital was supplied almost exclusively NLR blood. After August 2003 both LR and NLR blood were available for transfusion. This naturally created three distinct groups of patients: those who received only LR blood, those who received only NLR blood, and those who received at least one unit of each (mixed group). The American Red Cross performed pre-storage leukoreduction of whole blood or PRBCs via a filtration process to achieve <5 \u00d7 106 leukocytes/unit or less.

Mixed group patients also received a significantly greater amount of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and cryoprecipitate, and were also much more likely to have received a massive transfusion (P < 0.05). All three groups had a similar incidence of transfusion reactions. Similar analyses on patients who received a massive transfusion are presented in Table 2. These patients had a greater ISS, total number of units of blood transfused, ICU days, hospital days, ventilator days, incidence of ARDS, overall infection rate, vasopressor requirement, a worse MODS score, and a greater in-hospital mortality when compared with patients who did not receive a massive transfusion (P < 0.05). All transfusion reactions seen in this study were among massively transfused patients. There were no differences observed between groups among massively transfused patients in any of these categories (P > 0.05).\n\n",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously issued a recommendation for universal leukoreduction, but it has yet to become a national standard [32, 33]. The rationale for such a mandate is based on reduced transmission of infectious agents, transfusion-related immunomodulation, transfusion reactions, and a potential increase in cancer recurrence rates. Although these basic science studies of blood transfusion have helped to develop an understanding of the presumed benefits of leukoreduction, clinical studies comparing transfusion of LR blood vs. standard PRBCs have produced variable results. A large Canadian study carried out after institution of a universal leukoreduction program demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality from 7 to 6% but no effect on infection [25]. Studies among cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated a minimal but significant decrease in hospital length of stay without differences in infection or mortality [22, 23]. Perhaps the greatest benefit of LR blood was seen in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, with a tenfold reduction in rates of infection [34]. In an effort to clarify these seemingly conflicting results, two meta-analyses have been conducted. Unfortunately, because of the heterogeneous nature of the study populations, difference in transfusion practices, and varied methods of leukoreduction, neither of these studies could draw meaningful conclusions [27\u201329]. The only study comparing outcomes in trauma patients failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit in incidence of infection, organ failure, or mortality [26].",

Patients in the mixed group received more blood overall and were more likely to require a massive transfusion despite having ISS similar to patients in the other groups. Greater than 50% of the mixed group received massive transfusions compared to less than 20% in the other groups. In most cases, it is likely that the patients in the mixed group received both LR and NLR blood because their transfusion needs exceeded the blood bank supply of either type of blood. It is because they received both types of blood that the mixed group had more ICU days, more hospital days, more ventilator days, and higher MODS scores. Massively transfused patients had similar baseline characteristics and outcomes between all three groups. Based on these findings, we conclude that patients received both LR and NLR blood because the blood bank was acutely overwhelmed and did not have enough of either type of blood to meet the patients\u2019 requirements with one type alone. This introduces an obvious bias in that while the ISS was similar, the need for a massive transfusion predicts a more severely injured patient. The increased lengths of stay and morbidity seen in the mixed group are probably reflective of the fact that patients in this group were more likely to be massively transfused.",

As a retrospective analysis, this study is subject to the inherent biases of inadequate documentation, misinterpretation of clinical situations that occurred in the remote past, and subjective analysis by the research team. Research personnel involved in data collection evaluated every chart for a specific outcome measure to limit the subjectiveness and misinterpretation of clinical data. To limit heterogeneous data interpretation, research individuals were assigned a given outcome measure to evaluate rather than a series of patients and charts. The unique opportunity provided by the American Red Cross provision of only LR blood for one year provided the study a unique \u201cbefore and after\u201d analysis. This allows for somewhat of a natural randomization of patients, strengthening the analysis. Certainly, within the study period there could have been institutional and national changes in transfusion practices, critical care management, individual surgeon performance, and initiation of standardized protocols that potentially confound some of the results.",

The American Red Cross does not keep records of the age of the blood at the time of transfusion, and unfortunately we were unable to determine this information retrospectively. The age of the blood at the time of transfusion has been found to be a significant factor in assessing outcomes following transfusion [1, 35]. Additionally, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions were not included in the analysis, in part because of the significant difficulty in assessing this outcome retrospectively. Ensuring that a febrile episode could be attributed to a blood transfusion rather than a source of infection retrospectively is problematic. This may have dramatically lowered the incidence of overall transfusion reactions and potentially affected the analysis between groups.",

These patients had to have received at least two units of PRBCs, whereas patients in the LR and NLR groups could have received only one unit. Also, for the mixed group, the overall number of units was over twice that of the other two groups. In theory this could dramatically alter the statistical evaluation.
