Children and adolescents might be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection if they had close contact with confirmed patients, but the clinical course and outcome are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age compared with adolescents and adults. Transmission of SARS from pediatric patients appears to be uncommon but is not impossible[15]. Only a few cases of child deaths or transmission of the disease to adults as a source of infection have been reported. These observations raise the question of whether children have natural resistance to these two coronaviruses.",

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were productively infected by RSV in pediatric patients. Infection decreased interleukin 2 and interferon \u03b3 production RSV.

The actions of a variety of cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-4, played a critical role in the regulation of CD8+ T cell effector activity[30].

This classic form of cross-protection is mediated by lymphocytes, which release IFN- \u03b3, thereby activating bystander macrophages, resulting in a temporarily enhanced innate immune status against secondary infections, and this cross-protection status will quickly disappear once the major pathogens have been eliminated[44]. Contrary to this, Berg et al. found that memory lymphocytes can also mediate longer-term cross-protection as a byproduct of adaptive immunity: CD8 + memory T cells can be activated by cytokines (IL-12 and IL-18) in early stages of infection in an antigen-independent manner, leading to the production of IFN-\u03b3 and enhanced response to subsequent infectious agents[45].",

The study on SARS T cell subsets in children showed that the decrease of CD4+ and CD8+T cells was not obvious. Studies have confirmed that the decrease of CD4+ and CD8+ cells is closely related to the degree of lung lesions, so the absorption of inflammatory lesions in the lung in children is relatively mild. At the same time, B cells with T cell help also accelerate SARS specific antibody production, with higher positive rate than adults.",

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus results in depletion of T follicular helper(Tfh) co-expressed by IL-10 and IL-21, which impaired humoral immunity and viral control[52].

Various surveys published between 2003 and 2005 on this controversial issue[56], [57], [58], [59]. A group from Guangzhou held the opinion that the uninfected children had no specific antibodies. They confirmed the 1060 serum sample contained no virus particles by immunofluorescence prior to the serum specific antibody IgG and IgM detection, and only 2 cases of IgM and IgG antibody test result is positive respectively, they considered these few positive results for \u201cfalse positive\u201d of kits. This was at odds with a previously news report[60]. Researchers detected antibodies in serum collected from non-SARS children hospitalized for other illnesses in Beijing in 2001 and 2003 in order to exclude the possibility of covert infection in 2001. The positive rate was as high as 40% in both epidemic and non-epidemic year. The positive rate decreased gradually with age and down to zero in healthy adult control group, which led to the speculation that there were real differences between adults and children[58]. Another survey found that the antibody positive rate of healthy children and children was 2%, and the antibody positive rate of healthy adults and patients was only 0.2%, which also agreed that there was a significant difference between children and adults[56].",
