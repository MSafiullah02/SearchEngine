Currently available treatment options for these diseases have limited efficacy [4]. The approval of inhaled corticosteroids in the early 1970s opened a major breakthrough and the path for the treatment of airway diseases. Even after 40 years, these are still the mainstay of respiratory disease therapy. However, there are several limitations when it comes to the management of chronic disease conditions [5].",

The nucleotides contain five base pairs, two of which are purine derivatives (adenine and guanine) and the rest are pyrimidine derivatives (cytosine, thymine, and uracil). This class of substances function based on several approaches, namely, the RNAi (miRNA and siRNA), the antisense, the aptamer, the immunomodulatory and the decoy approaches. Most of these approaches are in early phases of development. However, there are several limitations with the current state of small molecule therapies. Thus, the use of oligonucleotides has emerged as an advancement in the treatment of respiratory diseases, as these cover a wide range of targets [5,6].

Oligonucleotides target the altered messenger RNA (mRNA) and decrease the synthesis of the causative protein-Huntingtin [16]. ASO can also be used as a therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinocerebellar ataxias [17].\u2022\nRespiratory disorders: Oligonucleotides can be administered as an inhalation for the treatment of asthma and COPD. They have fewer side effects as these molecules are directly targeted to the lungs. In addition, their uptake is usually enhanced at the target site which leads to their prolonged duration of action [18].\u2022\nCancer: Antisense oligonucleotides have emerged as a new therapeutical approach for the treatment of various types of cancers whereby, they attach with mRNA and inhibit gene translation [19]. However, non-specific protein binding and efficient delivery appear to be the major hurdles for their use in cancer treatment [19].\u2022\nDiabetic retinopathy: Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., iCo-007) are currently under trials for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. These act by down regulating the signaling pathway of multiple growth factors that are involved in the ocular angiogenesis and vascular leakage. They provide several advantages namely, increased half-life, lesser degradation and improved safety profile [20].

            "text": "DNA antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) molecules, act by modulating the expression of a target gene by binding to its mRNA, thereby prevent translation. The concept was first proposed by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 [21]. This was the first evidence reported in the literature, suggesting that oligonucleotides might be used for therapeutic intervention and since then AON technology has been developed for a wide array of therapeutic purposes. The growing interest of such approaches has risen from the fact that several copies of a protein can be produced by each mRNA molecule. D'anjou and team had patented a formulation of antisense oligonucleotides targeted against genes coding for phosphodiesterase. These can be used either as analytical agents or for therapy in cases of asthma, COPD, bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis and leads to rise in cyclic AMP and reduction in PDE level [22]. Another patent involves an oligonucleotide that has nucleotide sequence corresponding to the respiratory syncytial virus nucleotide sequence number 98\u2013116 or 627\u2013645 of the respiratory syncytial virus antigenome. The invention also provides a composition including oligonucleotide and a physiologically acceptable carrier [23]. It is, therefore, potentially a more efficient approach to target the mRNA rather than the protein itself [5]. Furthermore, CpG oligonucleotides attach to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) which causes an immune response by stimulation of intracellular signaling and causes the stimulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as NF-\u03baB. Aptamers bound tightly to the protein, targets to hinder their response. siRNA acts on Argonaute 2 and RNA-induced silencing complex. This complex has exonuclease and endonuclease activities that cause degradation of cellular mRNA, thus inhibiting translation. It also acts on Syk kinase, a signaling molecule that is responsible for inflammation [5]. Kinman and Yamada had patented a method of administering oligodeoxynucleotides for the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases in 2004. These were able to suppress immune response to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides for the management of inflammatory lung disorders [24]. Another invention involves a method for activation of immune response by using combination of immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides with immunopotentiating cytokines. These were administered as such or with nucleic acid delivery complex. These causes antigen specific immune response in both humans and animals [25].",

Advancement in the novel approaches like oligonucleotide-based microarray techniques, Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides, Antagomirs, and ADAM33 and NPSR1 targeting are some strategies that can be useful as the potential treatment strategies for respiratory diseases. Trend in approval of oligonucleotide-based therapy by FDA also showed the importance of oligonucleotides. Moreover, the problems associated with drug delivery can also be resolved by use of various novel drug delivery methods as described in this review for instance via development of liposomes, niosomes, nanoparticles, mucoadhesive targeting and dendrimers etc.",
