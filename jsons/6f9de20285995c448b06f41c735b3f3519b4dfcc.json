It can be speculated that this specific residue may mediate an interaction with other 258 cellular membrane proteins to module viral entry. The fact that LY6E enhances viral infectivity 259 in a cell type-specific manner, with the strongest phenotype in cells of fibroblast and monocytic 260 lineages (48), does indicate the involvement of other host cellular factors. Variations in the 261 abundance of expression, as well as the localization of LY6E and its associated proteins or lipids, 262 may explain the differential effects of LY6E on the infection of different viruses in different cell 263 types ( Fig. 4 and 7) . However, LY6E enhancement of RNA virus infection appears to be 264 independent of type I interferon response and other ISG expression (48) CoV-2pp and HCoV-NL63pp, that share the ACE2 receptor, does not support such a hypothesis 282 (Fig. 4) . 283",

In order to identify host cellular proteins that may enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of 153 C3A cells or suppress the virus entry into HepG2 cells, we first compared the expression of 154 several cellular genes with known activity to restrict or enhance virus entry into target cells. As 155 shown in Fig. 4A, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E mRNA expressed at significantly 156 higher levels in HepG2 cells. While the expression of ADAP2 and GILT did not inhibit HCoV-157 OC43pp infection (Fig. 4B), expression of LY6E in Flp-In TREx 293 cells efficiently suppressed 158 the infection of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of all the human 159 CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, except for SARS-CoV (Fig. 4C and 4D). In addition, LY6E 160 enhanced the infection of IAVpp (Fig. 4D). In agreement with our previous report, expression of 161 GILT inhibited SARS-CoVpp infection (38). To further confirm the role of LY6E in HCoV-162 OC43 infection, we showed that ectopic expression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells 163 significantly reduced their susceptibility to the virus infection, whereas reducing the expression 164 of LY6E in HepG2 cells by shRNA knockdown significantly increased HCoV-OC43 infection 165 (Fig. 5). The results presented above imply that LY6E is a restriction factor for human CoVs and 166 responsible for the differential susceptibility of C3A and HepG2 cells to HCoV-OC43 infection. 167 168 LY6E restriction of human coronavirus entry depends on GPI-anchor and the 169 evolutionally conserved L36 residue. LY6E is a member of the LY6/uPAR superfamily. Like 170 most LY6 family members, LY6E contains ten cysteines that form a highly conserved, three-171 finger folding motif through disulfide bonding and localizes on the plasma membrane of cells via 172 glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring. LY6E is ubiquitously expressed in many cell 173 types and functions in modulation of cell signal transduction (41). Recent studies revealed that 174 human LY6E promotes the entry of HIV (46, 47) and multiple enveloped RNA viruses from 175 several viral families (48). Moreover, the enhancement of RNA viral infection is a conserved 176 function of all the mammalian LY6E orthologs examined thus far. Particularly, substitution of 177 the evolutionally conserved residue L36 with alanine (A) completely abolished the viral 178 enhancement activity of LY6E(48). Interestingly, we found that L36A substitution also 179 abolished the activity of LY6E to restrict the entry of human CoVs(Fig. 6). As anticipated, 180 N99A substitution that disrupts the addition of GPI anchor also abrogated the inhibitory effects 181 of LY6E on human CoV entry(Fig. 6). These results indicate that proper interaction of LY6E 182 with other viral/cellular components via the conserved residue L36 and localization in the 183 specific cell membrane microdomians are required for LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. 184 185 Activation of CoV entry by TMPRSS2 expression fails to evade LY6E restriction of CoV 186 entry. It was reported by others and us that expression of cell membrane associated serine 187 protease TMPRSS2 enhances SARS-CoV and SARS-like bat CoV entry (32-34). More 188 importantly, the TMPRSS2-enhanced entry can evade IFITM3 restriction (Mei Zheng, et al, 189 manuscript under review), presumably because the cellular protease activates the viral fusion at 190 cell surface or early endosomes where IFITM3 expression at a relatively lower levels and thus 191 fails to inhibit viral fusion. To determine the effects of TMPRSS2 expression on LY6E 192 restriction of human CoV entry, Flp-In TREx 293-derived cell line expressing LY6E were 193 transfected with a control vector (pCAGGS) or a plasmid expressing human TMPRSS2 and 194 cultured in the absence or presence of tetracycline (tet) for 24 h. The cells were then infected 195 with the indicated pseudotyped lentiviruses. As shown in Fig. 7A, in absence of tet to induce 196 LY6E, expression of TMPRSS2 significantly enhanced the infection of SARS-CoVpp, MERS-197 CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp, but not the infection of other human CoVpp and LASVpp. 198 Interestingly, LY6E significantly inhibited the infection of MERS-CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp in 199 the cells without or with ectopic expression of TMPRSS2. Moreover, LY6E failed to inhibit 200 SARS-CoVpp infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression, but significantly inhibited 201 SARS-CoVpp infection in the cells expressing TMPRSS2 (Fig. 7B). Therefore, unlikely IFITM3, 202 expression of TMPRSS2 cannot evade LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. Instead, LY6E 203 restriction of the entry of human CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV, is regulated by the expression 204 of cellular proteases that previously known to activate the fusion activity of viral spike proteins. 205 206 Amphotericin B treatment does not compromise LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. 207 Amphotericin B (AmphoB) is antifungal medicine that binds with ergosterol in fungal cell 208 membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions and subsequent fungal 209 cell death. AmphoB can also bind to cholesterol in mammalian cell membrane, albeit at a lesser 210 affinity than to fungal ergosterol (49). The cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains 211 known as lipid rafts play important roles in the entry and egress of many enveloped viruses (50, 212 51). Particularly, AmphoB treatment had been shown to significantly compromise IFITM 213 restriction of IAV entry (52) and attenuate IFITM enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection (42). 214",

            "text": "53). However, LY6E is not a typical antiviral effector protein. Instead, LY6E was reported to 229 promote the infection of enveloped RNA viruses from several viral families (48) and modulates 230 HIV-1 infection in a manner dependent on the level of CD4 expression in target cells (46, 47). 231 Our finding that LY6E restricts human CoV infection and characterization of its antiviral effects 232 shed new lights on the mode of LY6E action on virus entry in general. 233 First, either the enhancement or restriction of LY6E on virus entry depends on its GPI 234 anchor (Fig. 6) (46-48). GPI-anchored proteins are preferentially located in lipid rafts, the plasma 235 membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol as well as protein 236 receptors or ligands. Lipid rafts are considered to compartmentalize membrane processes by 237 facilitating the interaction of protein receptors and their ligands/effectors to modulate membrane 238 functions, such as signal transduction, membrane fusion, vesicle budding and trafficking. Lipid 239 rafts also involve in the entry and egress of many viruses. For instance, both HIV-1 receptor 240 (CD4) and coreceptors are localized in lipid rafts. Yu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated 241 recently that LY6E enhances HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells and monocytic THP1-cells by 242 promoting the expansion of viral fusion pore induced by HIV-1 Env (47). Furthermore, LY6E 243 was found to be the receptor of mouse endogenous retroviral envelope Syncytin-A and 244 interaction of LY6E with Syncytin-A induces the syncytiotrophoblast fusion and placental 245 morphogenesis (55, 56). However, Mar and colleagues showed that LY6E enhances IAV 246 infection of cells by promoting a viral replication step after viral nucleocapsid escape from 247 endosomes, but before viral RNP nuclear translocation, i.e., most likely the uncoating of 248 nucleocapsids (48). Interestingly, the results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that LY6E significantly 249 enhanced the infection of IAVpp, suggesting that the LY6E enhancement of IAV infection is, at 250 least in part, through promoting the entry into target cells, possibly also by enhancing viral 251 fusion. Considering the broad inhibitory effects of LY6E on human CoVs and its fusogenic or 252 fusion-modulating activity, we speculate that LY6E might inhibit the membrane fusion triggered 253 by CoV spike proteins. However, the role of LY6E on endocytosis and endocytic vesicle 254 trafficking cannot be ruled out. These hypotheses are currently under investigation. 255",

This notion is further supported by the finding 268 that LY6E and Syncitin-A mediated syncytiotrophoblast fusion can be inhibited by IFITM 269 proteins (57, 58). 270 Third, studying the effects of LY6E on HIV-1 infection of CD4 low-expressing cells, 271 such as Jurkat T cells and primary monocyte-derived macrophages, revealed that HIV-1 entry 272 was inhibited by LY6E (46). This appears due to the LY6E-induced reduction of lipid raft-273 associated CD4 on the surface of these cells. It was demonstrated that LY6E can promote CD4 274 endocytosis and mobilize lipid raft-associated CD4 molecules to non-raft microdomains. Such a 275 receptor down-regulation significantly reduced HIV-1 binding and infection of CD4 low-276 expressing cells (macrophages), but did not significantly impact the binding of HIV-1 to CD4 277 high-expressing cells, which allows for LY6E to predominantly enhance HIV-1 infection of 278 CD4+ T lymphocytes by promotion of membrane fusion (46). It is, therefore, possible that LY6E 279 inhibition of human CoV infection is due to the down-regulation of lipid raft-associated CoV 280 receptors.

IFITMs modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of HepG2 and C3A cells in a similar 700 extent and via the same mechanism. HepG2 and C3A were stably transduced with a control 701 retroviral vector (pQCXIP) or a retroviral vector expressing a N-terminally flag tagged IFITM1-702 EX2 or IFITM3-EX2. The resulting cell lines were infected with HCoV-OC43 at 0.1 MOI. (A) 703 Cells were fixed at 24 hpi and virally infected cells were visualized by IF staining of HCoV-LY6E efficiently suppresses human coronavirus spike protein-mediated entry. (A) 719 Levels of Ly6E, GILT and ADAP2 mRNA expression in HepG2 and C3A cells were determined 720 by qRT-PCR assays and normalized to the level of GAPDH. (B) Flp-In T-Rex 293-derived cell 721 lines expressing control protein CAT, GILT or ADAP2 were cultured in the absence or presence 722 of tet for 24 h. The cells were infected with HCoV-OC43pp and other indicated pseudoviral 723 particles and intracellular luciferase activity were determined at 48 hpi. Relative infection is the 724 ratio of luciferase activity in the same cells cultured in the presence of tet over that in the absence 725 of tet. The error bars refer to standard deviations (n=4). (C) Flp-In T-Rex 293-derived cell line 726 expressing a control protein CAT or LY6E were cultured in the absence or presence of tet. Cells 727 were harvested at the indicated time after the addition of tet. Intracellular expression of LY6E 728 was detected by a Western blot assay. \u03b2-actin served as a loading control. (D) Flp-In T-Rex 293-729 derived cell lines expressing LY6E were cultured in the absence or presence of tet for 24 h. The 730 cells were then infected with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope protein of the 731 indicated viruses. Luciferase activities were determined at 48 hpi. Relative infection is the ratio 732 of luciferase activity in the same cells cultured in the presence of tet over that in the absence of 733 tet.

In the last decades, several IFN-inducible proteins, including three IFN-92 the entry of a variety of viruses. Interestingly, while IFITM proteins inhibit the entry of all the 97 other human CoVs, HCoV-OC43 hijacks human IFITM2 or IFITM3 as entry factors to facilitate 98 its infection of host cells (42, 43). We also demonstrated recently that GILT suppresses the entry 99 of SARS-CoV, but not other human CoVs (38). As reported herein, in our efforts to identify host 100 efficiency of HCoV-OC43pp infection in C3A cultures is approximately 50 folds higher than 124 that in HepG2 cultures. These results clearly indicate that the differential susceptibility is 125 attributed to the distinct ability of the two cell lines to support the infectious entry of HCoV-126 IFITM proteins modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of C3A and HepG2 cells in a similar 129 extent. We reported previously that IFITM proteins differentially modulate HCoV-OC43 entry 130 into target cells. While IFITM1 inhibits the virus entry, IFITM2 and IFITM3 enhance the cellular 131 entry of this virus(42). To investigate whether the differential expression of IFITM proteins in 132 the two cell lines is responsible for their difference in HCoV-OC43 infection efficiency, we 133",
