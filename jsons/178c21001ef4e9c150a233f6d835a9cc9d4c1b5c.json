Recent advances in distributed word representations address the word mismatch problem by enabling semantic matching. However, most existing models rank documents based on semantic matching between query and document terms without an explicit understanding of the relationship of the match to relevance. To consider semantic matching between query and document, we propose an unsupervised semantic matching model by simulating a user who makes relevance decisions. The primary goal of the proposed model is to combine the exact and semantic matching between query and document terms, which has been shown to produce effective performance in information retrieval. As semantic matching between queries and entire documents is computationally expensive, we propose to use local contexts of query terms in documents for semantic matching. Matching with smaller query-related contexts of documents stems from the relevance judgment process recorded by human observers. The most relevant part of a document is then recognized and used to rank documents with respect to the query. Experimental results on several representative retrieval models and standard datasets show that our proposed semantic matching model significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all measures.",

Query expansion techniques using global or local analysis of documents have shown improvements in the performance of retrieval models; however, these techniques suffer from query-independent analysis of documents in a large corpus or query drift [7] , respectively. Latent models have been used for matching queries and documents represented in latent semantic space. Although semantic matching is required for information retrieval, exact matching, especially when query terms are new or rare, still provides strong evidence of relevance [23] . Thus, these latent models alone do not perform well for information retrieval [3] . Translation models were initially proposed to address the term mismatch problem in the language modeling framework for information retrieval. These models estimate the likelihood that a query can be generated as a translation of a given document. Ganguly et al. [13] used word embedding [22, 28] to estimate document language models through a noisy channel to address the term mismatch problem. Although there is a large body of research on semantic matching of terms in queries and documents, many studies fail to capture important IR heuristics such as proximity and term dependencies [21] .",

Relevance in almost all retrieval models is measured by comparing query terms with terms in the entire text of a document. This fundamental choice of input to scoring functions is not compatible with how a person perceives a document as relevant or non-relevant to his/her information need. This mismatch can lead to non-optimal performance of retrieval systems [18, 19] . Kong et al. [38] described that a person first tries to locate pieces of a document that are likely to be related to the query. For each piece, the person then makes relevance decision based on the local context of the piece. If the piece is found to be relevant to the query, the document is judged as relevant, otherwise other pieces are considered for evaluation. Surprisingly little attention has been given to relevance ranking based on simulating how a person makes relevance decisions. Wu et al. [36] proposed a retrieval model simulating human relevance decision making and using context of query terms, however their model is not based on semantic similarity between query and the context of query terms.",

Having local contexts, we compare each piece of text with the query based on both exact and semantic term matching.

Kuzi et al. find terms that are similar to the entire query or its terms using word embeddings and use them to expand query in the relevance model [17] . Diaz et al. [10] propose to use locally-trained embeddings for query expansion, where documents sampled from the top retrieved documents for queries are used to train word embeddings. Latent Models. Latent models represent queries and documents in a latent space of reduced dimensionality using the term-document matrix, such as LSA [9] , PLSA [14] , and LDA [4] . However, these models do not perform well for information retrieval [3] . Wei and Croft [35] use LDA topics to estimate document language models in the language modeling framework, and shown improvements in the performance of retrieval. Therefore, we compare our model with this LDA-based language model as a representative of this group. [34] use (bilingual) word embeddings for monolingual and bilingual information retrieval, where queries and documents are represented as an average of the embeddings of their terms. However, the proposed model did not improve the performance of retrieval, unless it is combined with a basic retrieval model. Zheng and Callan [41] proposed a supervised model for re-weighting query terms in traditional retrieval models, BM25 and language modeling framework, based on embeddings of query terms. Although this model has shown to improve the performance of traditional retrieval models, the retrieval is still based on only exact matching of query and document terms.",

And when parameter \u03b8 is set to the similarity value of a term to itself, the scoring function reduces to exact term matching. The underlying assumption in the scoring function of Eq. (3) as well as many well-established retrieval models is independence between query terms. However, the similarity between query-centric (q i ) and current query term (q i ) does not consider in this function. As an example, consider the query 303 of TREC Robust dataset, \"Hubble telescope achievements\". And assume that we want to score a local context of query term \"Hubble\" which is a space telescope in a document. Thus, term \"Hubble\" is in the center of this local context. Although terms \"Hubble\" and \"telescope\" should logically have a higher similarity degree than terms \"Hubble\" and \"achievements\" in any term association resource, we believe occurrences of terms related to \"achievements\" in the local context makes it more likely to be relevant to the query than those of \"telescope\", because we already know that \"Hubble\" exists in the context and occurring \"telescope\" can not have much information of relevance compared to \"achievements\".

To do that, we first extract the positions of query terms in the document by Indri. Then, we find the neighbors of the query terms based on their positions in the document. By finding the neighbors of the query terms, we compute the semantic similarity between query terms and the query-centric contexts (i.e., the neighbors of the query terms). In other words, we do not consider all terms in a document to compute the semantic similarity. In contrast, the generalized language model [13] take into account all terms in the document to find the semantic similarity between the query and document which makes their approach so expensive. Note that our approach still is more effective since is more compatible with the human judgment process. Our approach is also more efficient compared to the topic modeling language model (LDA) [35] , since they also use all terms in a document to model term associations. Also, the running time for each of the Gibbs sampling in LDA increases linearly with the number of documents N and the number of topics K i.e., O(NK) which makes their approach even more expensive compared to the generalized language model. Zamani and Croft [39] proposed an embedding query expansion named EQE1 to estimate query language model. They used word embedding similarities to find terms in the entire vocabulary that are semantically related to the query terms. This method is much faster than the previous ones (i.e., LDA model [35] and generalized language model [13] ) but is not optimal since it needs to compute similarity scores between query terms and all terms in the vocabulary.",

For example, if we have a query with two terms, and two query-centric contexts, the context that can interpret more distinct query words should be assigned a higher score. Clinchant et al. [6] showed that Log-Logistic model satisfies all constraints in the PRF framework. Therefore, we modify this model in our approach to compute semantic similarity between query-centric context and query terms.

This shows that our model in addition to using the proximity of query terms in a document improves the retrieval performance by exploiting the semantic similarity of terms. Unlike SDM, the EQE1 and LDA baseline models consider semantic similarity and topic modeling in document ranking, respectively. According to the results in this table, LCD-Logistic outperforms EQE1 and LDA-based retrieval models. We only report the results of the LDA model on Robust due to the prohibit training time of LDA on the other two collections. These comparisons show the importance of capturing semantic similarity in the local context for information retrieval. We also report GMAP to evaluate our method in confrontation with hard queries. We also report the recall metric in this table. According to the results, LCD-Logistic improves recall in Robust and Gov2 collections substantially.",
