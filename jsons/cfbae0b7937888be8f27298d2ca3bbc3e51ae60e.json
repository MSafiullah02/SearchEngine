Non-survivors, with profound hypoxia and inflammatory response, are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [2, 3] . Additionally, reduced peripheral lymphocytes, high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, and significantly abnormal coagulation parameters are hallmarks in those severe cases [4, 5] . Emerging evidence indicates the potential benefits of managing cytokine storm, via using steroid or IL-6/ IL-6-receptor blocking antibodies [3, 6] . The capability of blood purification therapy in removing pathogenic antibodies or cytokines has been proven in multiple scenarios, but not in COVID-19 patients [7, 8] .",

He felt fever and lethargy on Jan 16, and diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive IgM/IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and bilateral ground glass shadows in chest computed tomography (CT) one week later. Treated with antibiotics and Ribavirin, his fever persisted and aggravated dyspnea developed. On February 5, endotracheal intubation was performed because of severe respiratory failure. On February 20, he was transferred to our ICU, ventilated at pressure control (PC) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8cmH 2 O. Lab tests showed persistent leukopenia (0.71 \u00d7 10 9 /l) and elevated inflammation (CRP 105.5 mg/l [reference 0-3 mg/l], IL-6 54.57 pg/ml [reference 0-7 pg/ ml]). We treated him with antibiotics, gamma globulin and other supportive therapies. Then, we observed a continuous decrease of platelet count (minimum value 32 \u00d7 10 9 /l on March 6), increase of D-dimer (maximum value 19.73\u03bcg/ml on March 6) and inflammatory markers (maximum CRP 192.7 mg/l, IL-6236.3 pg/ml on March 9), while his prothrombin time (PT) remained stable. On March 5, dry gangrene appeared in his right index finger. Within one week, we confirmed multiple cerebral infarction with brain CT and bilateral jugular venous thrombi with doppler ultrasound. On March 11, antiphospholipid antibodies were positive for anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein-I (anti-\u03b22GPI-IgG 258.1CU [reference 0-20CU] and anticardiolipin (aCL-IgG 43.2CU [reference 0-20CU]). Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was diagnosed and he was treated the low molecular weight heparin and aspirin. From March 14 to 16, we performed three sessions of plasma exchange, after which dramatic reduction of the titers of antiphospholipid antibodies and inflammatory marker were observed (anti-\u03b22GPI-IgG 45.1CU, aCL-IgG 8.3CU, CRP 44.4 mg/l, IL-6 92.05 pg/ml) (Fig. 1) .

Lab tests showed leukopenia (0.44 \u00d7 10 9 /l) and elevated inflammatory marker (CRP 67.6 mg/l, IL-6 46.76 pg/ml). He was treated with antibiotics, Arbidol, methylprednisolone and oxygen therapy. On Feb 16, his respiratory failure required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (PC mode, PC 20cmH 2 O, PEEP 14cmH 2 O, FiO 2 50%). And refractory respiratory acidosis and hypoxia (ABG PH 7.20, O 2 55mmHg, CO 2 69 mmHg) led to venous-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) therapy. Meanwhile, we treated him with antibiotics, gamma globulin, hydrocortisone and other supportive therapy. His leukopenia and inflammatory marker elevation persisted (lymphocyte 0.16 \u00d7 10 9 /l, CRP 259.3 mg/l, IL-6556.3 pg/ ml). On Feb 19, he experienced sudden death and was successfully resuscitated, after which continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated. It was performed with the oXiris\u00ae hemofilter (Baxter, Meyzieu, France), a modified AN69 surface treated membrane with adsorption capacity [9] . The hemofilter was changed every 12-24 h for 6 days, and his lab tests were improved (lymphocyte 0.43 \u00d7 10 9 /l, CRP 154.9 mg/l, IL-6 78.22 pg/ml) (Fig. 1) Available online 01 April 2020 1521-6616/ \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

His leukopenia persisted and inflammation intensified (CRP 298.4 mg/l, IL-6304.4 pg/ml) until Feb 23. We gave methylprednisolone and CRRT with oXiris\u00ae hemofilter on Feb 24. On Feb 26, we stopped CRRT because the inflammatory markers were almost normalized in two days (CRP 59.1 mg/l, IL-6 5.63 pg/ml) (Fig. 1) . His ventilator's setting was quickly downregulated and the weaning was successful on March 1. He was transferred out of the ICU for rehabilitation on March 7.",

These cases highlight the presence of cytokine storm or pathogenic antibodies after three weeks of COVID-19 onset (Fig. 1) , which correlated with the disease severities. Monitoring inflammation and antibodies are important especially in patients infected by virus with persistent fever or abnormal coagulopathy. Expeditious control of the cytokine storm in early phase might be beneficial to selective patients, and blood purification therapy is effective in our limited experiences. The therapies are tolerable to most patients if performed with the assistance of nephrology specialists, in order to minimize risks of infection and bleeding. Although randomized trial data is lacking, we propose that multi-disciplinary efforts should be made to maximize the availability of blood purification therapy to proper patients. ",
