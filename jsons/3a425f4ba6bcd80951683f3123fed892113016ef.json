The relationship between age and infections due to viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, capsulated Pittman type b strains, Eordetella pertussis and other organisms affecting the upper respiratory tract are mainly discussed in Chapters 8 and 10. The eustachian tubes in infants are relatively wider and more horizontal than in adults; this might partly explain the greater incidence of acute otitis media in infants since the causative organisms may spread directly from the throat to the middle ear via the eustachian tube. Older children and adults usually have good immunity to a wide range of respiratory pathogens but the 'common cold' continues to be prevalent in these age groups. Sinusitis frequently occurs in adults and children.",

Care should be taken to sample the inflamed site and not to contaminate the swab by touching the other parts of the mouth. The swab should be put into Stuart's or other suitable transport medium if a delay of more than 1 hour is expected before the swab can be plated out on blood agar. If no beta-haemolytic streptococci are isolated after overnight incubation of the culture plate, viruses are the probable cause of the sore throat. However, if a bacitracin-sensitive beta-haemolytic streptococcus is isolated, it is likely that the sore throat is due to Strep, pyogenes (but see p. 17). Recently tests have been developed to detect Strep, pyogenes antigen in throat swabs, which allows rapid diagnosis, but they are not yet reliable enough to be recommended routinely. Cultures are also preferable because antibiotic sensitivity tests and typing investigations on isolates can be carried out. Cultures for C. diphtheriae are essential when diphtheria is clinically suspected {see p. 199 and Chapter 1). C. haemolyticum should be looked for, especially in patients with a sore throat and a scarlet fever-type rash, and antibiotic sensitivity tests carried out if this organism is isolated because some strains are more sensitive to erythromycin than penicillin.",

The decline in the incidence of the disease in developed countries is probably mainly due to an improvement in general living conditions. Pathogenesis The exact pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is unknown but there is no doubt that it is related to a previous Strep, pyogenes throat infection which occurs usually 2-4 weeks before the clinical onset of the disease. Antibodies develop to cell wall antigens of the streptococcus which cross-react with the sarcolemma of human heart and other tissues. Characteristic rheumatic granulomata develop in connective tissue in many different sites in the body and, in the heart, these are known as AschofTs nodules. Rheumatic heart valvular disease can ultimately occur especially if there are repeated attacks of rheumatic fever. Certain children appear to have a genetic predisposition to developing rheumatic fever following Strep, pyogenes infection. They may develop repeat attacks of rheumatic fever following infection due to a wide range of M types of Strep, pyogenes. Diagnosis Major clinical features of rheumatic fever may include fleeting polyarthritis, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum. Supporting laboratory evidence of a recent streptococcal infection is usually provided by demonstrating a rising serum ASO titre, or a raised ASO titre greater than 200 Todd units per ml. The diagnosis of rheumatic fever is unlikely if the ASO and anti-streptococcal (DNAase B) titres are not raised. Occasionally, Strep, pyogenes is also isolated from a throat swab but this is of little diagnostic value since this merely indicates streptococcal carriage. Prophylaxis Following the first attack of rheumatic fever, prophylaxis to prevent repeated episodes of rheumatic fever developing is effectively carried out by giving either monthly injections of benzathine penicillin or twice daily oral penicillin V. Penicillin prophylaxis against throat infections is necessary throughout childhood and the early teenage years.",

            "text": "glomerulonephritis Post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis characteristically affects children or young adults and usually occurs about 10 days after Strep, pyogenes infection. Pathogenesis This complication only follows infection due to a small number of 'nephritogenic' types of Strep, pyogenes^ including M types 12, 1, 3, 4 and 25 when the site of infection is the throat. (Different M types, including M types 49 and 52, are implicated when nephritis follows streptococcal pyoderma; see Chapter 16, p. 380). The pathogenesis of the disease involves the deposition of circulating immune complexes in the glomerulus and there have been recent reports of streptococcal plasma membrane having been identified in affected glomeruli. Characteristically the serum complement components are reduced during the active stage of the disease, especially C3. Activation of the complement and coagulation systems at the sites of deposition of the immune complexes in the glomeruli results in local tissue inflammation and histology of the lesions shows typical proliferative changes. Diagnosis, prognosis and use of penicillin Clinical features include haematuria and signs of acute nephritic syndrome. The prognosis is good in children-they usually recover completely. Subsequent serious complications, such as renal failure, may rarely occur and this is possibly more likely in adults. The serum ASO titre is usually elevated and a rising titre may be demonstrated after streptococcal throat infection (in contrast anti-DNAase B antibodies only are elevated after previous streptococcal skin infection). Penicillin may be given to treat any residual. Strep. pyogenes infection. Subsequent prophylaxis with penicillin is not indicated as it is unlikely that a repeat infection due to a nephritogenic type of Strep, pyogenes would occur.",
