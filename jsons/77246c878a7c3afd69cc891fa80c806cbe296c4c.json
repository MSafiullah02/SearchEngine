That FGL2 accounted for pathogenesis was shown by the fact that both neutralizing antibody to FGL2 ameliorated the pathological process and FGL2 knockout mice are resistant to liver disease and have increased survival. 1 First cloned from cytotoxic T lymphocytes, FGL2 was classified as a fibrinogen superfamily member. 2 The procoagulant activity has been localized to the linear N terminal domain of mFGL2. CD4 + CD25 + T cells have recently been shown to secrete a soluble form of FGL2 (sFGL2), which has now been proposed to have immunomodulatory activity. 3 We recently reported that sFGL2 inhibits T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell maturation. 4 That FGL2 exists as both soluble and membrane forms is not unique and has been described for other inflammatory molecules including tissue factor, CD16, and CD38. The purpose of this study is to identify the receptor(s) for sFGL2 and investigate the role of sFGL2 receptor interaction in MHV pathogenesis. ",

As members of the triggering receptors expressed by myeloid cells (TREM), Fc\u03b3 receptors consist of are associated with a two amino acid polymorphism in the second extracellular domain. 5 Uniquely, B lymphocytes express only CD32 and NK cells express only CD16 on their surfaces, while most immune cells express all three receptors. 6 The expression level of those receptors can be regulated by Th1/2 cytokines controlling the balance of immune responses. 7 Viruses have evolved various strategies to counteract host immunity and thus, escape host immune surveillance. For example, coronavirus spike protein (S) displays Fc\u03b3 receptor activity. The anti-mouse Fc\u03b3RII/III monoclonal antibody, 2.4 G2, has been shown to immunoprecipitate S protein of MHV, and by amino acid sequence analysis it was shown that the S protein and the Fc\u03b3Rs share homology. 8 Therefore, it was hypothesized that nonspecific antibody binding with the S protein will prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This is not unique to MHV, and herpes simplex virus also can induce Fc receptor activity as a means of escaping immune surveillance. 9",

In susceptible mice, the interaction of sFGL2 with the activating CD16 may induce the activation of macrophages, NK cells, neutrophils, and platelets and contribute to disease. In addition, sFGL2 by binding with the S protein, may enhance viral replication. Finally, binding of sFGL2 to B cells may lead to apoptosis resulting in inhibition of neutralizing antibody production. Consistent with this concept sFGL2 does not bind to B cells from A/J mice known to be resistant to MHV, whereas it binds avidly to B cells from susceptible C57BL/6J mice.",
