Glucose is the most abundant carbohydrate in the body and is the principal fuel for the brain and peripheral tissues. Insulin is secreted from \u03b2-cells in the pancreas and is responsible for transporting glucose into the cells to be utilised immediately or stored as glycogen (Klein 2012) . Maintaining euglycaemia depends on the body's ability to secrete the appropriate hormone in response to changing concentrations of blood glucose (BG).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 429, "text": "(Klein 2012)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In a hypoglycaemic state, glucagon and adrenaline levels rise within minutes to facilitate a transient increase in glucose production (Cryer 2004) . Hypoglycaemia causes the hypothalamus to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to release adrenaline from the adrenal glands. Adrenaline acts quickly to limit further secretion of insulin and increase secretion of glucagon. Glucagon, which is secreted from the \u03b1 cells of the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in increased glucose production from hepatic cells (Koenig 2015) . Glucagon inhibits glucose uptake by peripheral tissues and stimulates the release of gluconeogenic precursors (Guyton & Hall 2006) . However, the effects of glucagon are temporary and are quickly suppressed by increasing levels of insulin. Cortisol and growth hormone are released more slowly, typically a few hours following the onset of hypoglycaemia. Cortisol increases the rate of lipolysis and release of amino acids from muscle that also facilitate gluconeogenesis. Growth hormone works synergistically by decreasing utilisation of glucose by peripheral tissues as well as promoting lipolysis (Guyton & Hall 2006) . A study examining these mechanisms in adrenalectomised dogs concluded that even when counter-regulatory hormones are absent, the body can utilise glucose auto-regulation and increased neural efferent signalling in order to stimulate hepatic production of glucose (Gregory et al. 2017) . There is also evidence that central excitatory amino acids may also contribute to the maintenance of euglycaemia via activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and subsequent stimulation of the sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (Molina & Abumrad 2001) . In addition to increases in concentrations in plasma concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones, there is evidence of increases in concentrations of immunoreactive \u03b2-endorphins, adrenocorticotropin and cortisol within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in response to hypoglycaemia. However, the significance of these alterations in CSF concentrations remains unknown (Radosevich et al. 1988 ). hypoglycaemia, clinical signs may be minimal or absent until glucose levels are profoundly decreased, as a result of hypoglycaemic unawareness. The pathophysiology of hypoglycaemic unawareness is not fully understood but is thought to occur in patients whose brains have been conditioned to automatically upregulate cerebral glucose uptake as a result of prolonged, chronic or recurrent hypoglycaemia. This automatic mechanism of cerebral glucose uptake can actually lead to a decreased perception of peripheral hypoglycaemia and blunting of the body's counter-regulatory responses (Weinstock et al. 2016) . While there is little evidence that this occurs in companion animals, it is important to keep in mind when evaluating patients with conditions that may place them at risk for chronic hypoglycaemia, including chronic insulin overdose of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and insulinomas.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 146, "text": "(Cryer 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 546, "end": 559, "text": "(Koenig 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 672, "end": 692, "text": "(Guyton & Hall 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1181, "text": "(Guyton & Hall 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1468, "text": "(Gregory et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1746, "text": "(Molina & Abumrad 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2138, "text": "(Radosevich et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2724, "end": 2747, "text": "(Weinstock et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Glucose homoeostasis"}, {"text": "The brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of hypoglycaemia because it cannot manufacture its own glucose and is dependent on the constant availability of adequate amounts of glucose for energy (Boyle 1997) . While it may briefly utilise ketones, the brain has a limited ability to utilise other forms of energy (Boyle 1997) . In order to keep up with the brain's needs, glucose is continuously transported across the blood brain barrier from the peripheral bloodstream via facilitated transport. Glucosensors within the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, intestinal tract, carotid body and hepatoportal area act to control the amount of glucose that is transported through the blood brain barrier (Loose et al. 2008) . If arterial glucose levels fall, the diffusion gradient cannot be adequately maintained and neuroglycopenia may transpire. Prolonged neuroglycopenia can lead to permanent brain injury and neurologic signs that may persist beyond resolution of the hypoglycaemia (Kraje 2003, Loose et al. 2008) . While transient hypoglycaemic episodes do not typically cause damage or persistent neurologic deficits, severe or repeated hypoglycaemic states can result in neurologic deficits that may resemble other acute neurological disease processes. This syndrome is referred to as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy (Witsch et al. 2012 ). The prognosis for human patients is variable and ranges from reversible neurologic deficits (Aoki et al. 2004 , Bottcher et al. 2005 , Kim et al. 2007 , Maruya et al. 2007 to persistent neurologic deficits, persistent vegetative state and death (Mori et al. 2006 , Ma et al. 2009 , Kang et al. 2010 , Yaffe et al. 2013 , Mehta et al. 2016 .

The occurrence of these arrhythmias has led to concern that hypoglycaemic states may be pro-arrhythmogenic (Sanon et al. 2014) .

Although the gold standard for the measurement of blood glucose is analysis by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, this is not available in a clinical setting (Tonyushkina & Nichols 2009 ). Therefore, most glucose levels are measured with handheld point-of-care glucometers (POCG). POCGs that are typically designed for humans can demonstrate inconsistencies regarding accuracy in veterinary species (Cohen et al. 2009 ). Other POCGs marketed to veterinarians utilise internal algorithms that attempt to quantify species differences between free and haemoglobin-bound glucose (Zini et al. 2009 ). The accuracy of handheld glucometers can be vulnerable to delays in separation of the serum from the red blood cells longer that 30 minutes after collection, leading to pseudohypoglycaemia as a result of continued consumption of glucose by the red blood cells in vitro (Koenig & Verlander 2015) . This effect can be prevented by collecting blood samples in sodium fluoride tubes if they cannot be processed via centrifugation within that time period. Haemodilution and haemoconcentration can also affect the accuracy of glucose readings (Solnica et al. 2012) . The mechanism behind this is believed to be a result of a reduction of the volume of plasma due to the presence of increased erythrocytes in a haemoconcentrated sample. This causes the volume of plasma that is able to penetrate the reagent layer to be reduced, resulting in a falsely reduced glucose measurement (Tang et al. 2000) . Conversely, a haemodiluted sample allows an abnormally large amount of plasma to contact the test strip reagent layer, which falsely elevates the glucose measurement (Tang et al. 2000) . Lane et al. (2015) proposed a formula to correct the glucose level given a known packed cell volume, but additional algorithms would need to be developed and validated for other glucometer models.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 159, "text": "(Cryer 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 321, "end": 348, "text": "(Tonyushkina & Nichols 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 562, "end": 580, "text": "(Cohen et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 738, "end": 755, "text": "(Zini et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1053, "text": "(Koenig & Verlander 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1317, "text": "(Solnica et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1650, "text": "(Tang et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1837, "text": "(Tang et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1858, "text": "Lane et al.

The sensor is comprised of a glucose diffusion limiting membrane which contains glucose oxidase. When the membrane is exposed to glucose in the presence of oxygen, it undergoes an oxidation reaction to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide creates a current that reflects the glucose level within the interstitium via a reaction with the platinum electrode (Reineke et al. 2010) .

Furthermore, obese animals and cats that regularly received more than 6 units of insulin per injection were at increased risk (Whitley et al. 1997) . Diabetic animals that are experiencing gastrointestinal upset secondary to concurrent underlying illness were also reported to be at increased risk for experiencing hypoglycaemia secondary to concurrent administration of exogenous insulin (Whitley et al. 1997) .

Diagnostic modalities include an amended or standard insulin glucose ratio, fructosamine levels, glucagon tolerance testing and oral glucose tolerance tests (Greene & Bright 2008 , Melano & Peterson 2013 . Abdominal ultrasound has low sensitivity to detect these tumours and, in some cases, CT or abdominal exploratory is recommended for definitive identification (Robben et al. 2005) . Medical treatment options include stabilisation of refractory and life-threatening hypoglycaemia via administration of glucagon continuous infusions if indicated, frequent feeding and oral administration of glucocorticoids as well as other adjunctive medications such as diazoxide and somatostatin therapy to help alleviate clinical signs and maintain normoglycaemia. Both diazoxide and somatostatin result in membrane hyperpolarisation and inhibition of normal insulin release (Dunne & Peterson 1991) . Diazoxide may increase hepatic glucose production and reduce peripheral glucose uptake (Altszuler et al. 1977) . Somatostatin has inhibitory effects on several other hormones including glucagon, secretin and vasoactive inhibitory peptide. Somatostatin analogues like octreotide are used more commonly due to their longer half-life (Lamberts et al. 1996) . Octreotide has been evaluated in healthy dogs and dogs with insulinomas (Robben et al. 2006) : following administration, plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations decreased in healthy dogs but only insulin decreased in dogs with insulinomas. None of the dogs experienced significant adverse effects from the medication. Evaluation of somatostatin receptors in canine insulinomas revealed that dogs only express one type of somatostatin receptor, in contrast to humans who can express several types (Robben et al. 1997) .

A recent report also documents for the first time HHS in a 6-year-old female spayed British shorthair cat secondary to suspect nesidioblastosis, a term which describes non-neoplastic \u03b2-cell hyperplasia within the pancreas (Hambrook et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 275, "end": 298, "text": "(Senniappan et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 603, "end": 630, "text": "(Breitschwerdt et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 855, "end": 877, "text": "(Hambrook et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic syndrome"}, {"text": "Xylitol One of the most common toxins associated with hypoglycaemia in dogs is xylitol, an artificial sweetener that is commonly found in sugar-free gum, sweets, baked goods, nutritional supplements and dental care products, many of which are designed as sugar-free alternatives for humans with DM (Dunayer 2004) . Once ingested, peak plasma levels of xylitol in dogs are reached within 30 minutes. The majority of xylitol is metabolised in the liver and transformed to d-xylulose, which then becomes d-xylulose-5-phosphate (Froesch & Jakob 1974 , Piscitelli et al. 2010 . Xylitol is then converted to glucose, glycogen or lactate via the pentose phosphate pathway (Piscitelli et al. 2010) . Unlike humans, dogs experience a marked dose-dependent insulin surge following xylitol ingestion, leading to hypoglycaemia (Xia et al. 2009 ). Hepatic failure in dogs secondary to xylitol has also been described (Dunayer & Gwaltney-Brant 2006 , Todd & Powell 2007 . A recent retrospective article found the most common clinical signs associated with xylitol ingestion in dogs were vomiting and lethargy, and 15% of dogs became hypoglycaemic during hospitalisation (DuHadway et al. 2015) . None of the dogs developed hepatic failure and all survived to discharge. Historically, 0\u20221 g/kg is the minimal dose believed to result in hypoglycaemia, while dogs ingesting 0\u20225 g/kg or greater are believed to be at increased risk of developing acute liver failure (Dunayer & Gwaltney-Brant 2006) . There is also evidence that the development of hypoglycaemia and, especially, acute liver failure may be idiosyncratic rather than strictly dose-dependent, because previous cases series have documented dogs recovering after ingesting up to 16 g/kg of xylitol, while other dogs have died after ingesting far lower doses (Dunayer & Gwaltney-Brant 2006) .

It is important that veterinarians are able to recognise the vast array of symptoms that a hypoglycaemic patient may exhibit. Fortunately, hypoglycaemic patients commonly respond well to initial symptomatic treatment although the prognosis for the underlying diseases vary considerably and it is important that owners are adequately informed on the prognosis of their individual animal. Advances in at-home monitoring for patients with DM in the form of CGMS and potential future development of sc glucagon emergency kits may help owners to recognise hypoglycaemic events in the early stages and provide initial therapy before the episode becomes prolonged. Additional novel methods of early detection that may one day be extrapolated from human medicine include development of a method to analyse breath samples to detect the presence of volatile organic compounds which may signal hypoglycaemia in patients with DM (Siegel et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1042, "end": 1062, "text": "(Siegel et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}], "ref_spans":
