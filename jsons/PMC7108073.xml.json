As of 20 August 2014, 855 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, including 333 deaths. Most of the cases (97.5%) have occurred in the Middle East (KSA, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran), with 723 cases alone reported from KSA. In all 21 cases that have been reported outside the Middle East (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Tunisia, Algeria, Malaysia, Philippines, United States), the patients had lived in or traveled to the Middle East, or had contact with travelers returning from these areas [2].",

Although the close phylogenetic relation of human MERS-CoV isolates initially suggested bats as a putative natural reservoir [3], there is increasing evidence that dromedary camels serve as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans [4]. MERS-CoV sequences have been identified in dromedary camels\u2019 nasal secretions [5, 6], but also in raw milk samples of infected animals [7]. There is serologic evidence for MERS-CoV infection in camels and calves from various regions in the Middle East and beyond [8\u201310]. Isolated viruses are matching to a high degree to the genomes of the human MERS-CoV [11], and phenotypic characterization of viruses revealed that cell tropism and replication kinetics/competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV are similar [12]. Recently, virus replication and shedding was confirmed in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected camels [13].",

This raised important questions: Was this a real increase in cases or simply a surveillance artefact due to reporting of false positives or a change in surveillance practice with a more sensitive case detection? Was this increase caused by an increased number of new introductions from the natural reservoir and/or did this increase indicate a breach in infection control measures that allowed increased nosocomial transmission? One of the most pressing questions, however, was whether there was evidence for a change in transmissibility of MERS-CoV enabling a more efficient human-to-human transmission.",

Nosocomial transmission is a particular risk factor for international spread, especially if exposure in healthcare settings is more likely than exposure through enzootic contact. The large outbreaks of MERS-CoV in Jeddah and Riyadh have stressed the importance of infection control strategies and practices, not only when caring for suspected MERS-CoV patients, but for overall patient care. Identification of the specific factors that facilitate transmission in the healthcare setting will be key to inform measures for interruption of transmission as shown with SARS [24]. Up to now, no sustained human-to-human spread has been shown for MERS-CoV in the community setting. The role of super-spreading of MERS-CoV in the hospital setting, however, remains to be further elucidated. In the SARS outbreak in 2003, super-spreading events accounted for >70% of the cases, with SARS-CoV being moderately transmissible [25].",

Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence to distinguishing nosocomial transmission from independently acquired infections from zoonotic sources. Further insights in transmission dynamics might be provided and unnoticed transmission links revealed.

This decline in numbers however, should not allow complacency as cases continue to be reported in September, with the first case reported in an expatriate healthcare worker on 22 September 2014, suggestive of nosocomial transmission [27]. Special attention to hospital clusters should be given during the Hajj period, when millions of pilgrims from >180 countries will visit KSA and the health system risks becoming overburdened.
