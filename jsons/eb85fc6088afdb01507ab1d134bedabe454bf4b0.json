However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy. Finally, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols. arXiv:2005.08922v2 [cs.CY] 19 May 2020",

However, in recent years the frequency and likelihood of such outbreaks as well as their collateral economic damage is continuously growing [1] . Related research indicates that this is due to several factors favouring the spread of zoonotic diseases, such as the ever increasing urbanization and deforestation, the ongoing climate crisis and the increasingly globalized and connected world economy [2] . Already, in the first two decades of the 21 th Particularly in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the implications of the associated disease, COVID-19, have been globally profound. Initially reported in Wuhan, People's Republic of China in December 2019, the virus has practically spread to all countries in the world in the following months. By May 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported nearly four million COVID-19 cases and more than two hundred sixty thousand related deaths worldwide [3] . The spread was rapid and caused, in a short period of time, a significantly increased number of patients requiring admission to hospitals and intensive care units, resulting to some health systems to be overwhelmed [4] .",

The economic repercussions were severe; indicatively, the World Bank predicted in a preliminary report in April 2020 a 4% contraction of the global GDP under an amplified global pandemic [6] ; the World Trade Organisation expected global trade to fall up to 32% in 2020 [7] ; reports estimated the drop in the USA GDP to be as high as 11% [8] ; and the European Commission expected a record 7% contraction of the EU economy [9] . For countries whose economies have great exposure on international tourism, such as Mexico, Spain and Greece, contraction would be even greater, reaching or exceeding 15% [7] . A positive linear correlation was found between the duration of the measures and the negative impact on economy. Therefore, the need to fine tune the balance between reducing the negative economic impact and containing the pandemic necessitated for innovative and effective lockdown exit strategies.",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 lack of accurate rapid tests (since SARS-CoV-2 was new) means that the testing capacity and throughput of health systems was limited. Therefore much focus was placed on rigorous contact tracing of newly identified COVID-19 patients. This approach aimed to increase the effectiveness of diagnostic testing by promptly identifying asymptomatic patients and pre-emptively removing them from the general population via self-isolation. Empirically, it was proven that countries that adopted this strategy were successful in containing the pandemic in its early stages [11] .",

For instance, it does not allow for the informed reopening of hospitality businesses (restaurants, entertainment venues, etc) or the full return to work of office employees.

We identify (a) its dependency upon public perception and adoption (mainly due to privacy concerns); (b) its reactive nature, as it assumes that the disease is already present in the population; and (c) the problem of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols. These limitations make DCT not fit for purpose in use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals need to travel over long distances and across borders. \u2022 Motivated by the dependency of several national economies (such as those of Mexico, Portugal, and Greece) on international tourism, and the relevant announcements by the World Health Organisation and several national governments, we discuss the concept of a Digital Health Passport. We outline a corresponding use case and define the relevant functional and technical requirements. \u2022 We present DHP Framework; a scalable, distributed and secure framework for issuing Digital Health Passports (DHP). The framework provisions the secure issuance of digitally signed DHPs by local health facilities to individuals following medical tests. Each health facility announces the DHPs to its corresponding national health authority, that proceeds with registering them on a private blockchain. The health authorities of multiple countries form part of the DHP Blockchain consortium, which uses Proof of Authority as a consensus mechanism. The consortium also includes members with read-only access on the blockchain, such as airline companies and border control authorities. These members are able to check the validity of the health passport only for the travellers they are concerned and in a way that respects their privacy and their right to be forgotten. \u2022 We analyse the presented framework with respect to its functionality, as well as its security and privacy aspects. We conclude the paper, by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols. The paper is organised as follows. In Section II, we provide the background and cover the related work on strategies for controlling epidemics, we discuss Digital Contact Tracing and provide its limitations, and we provide a brief introduction to blockchain technologies and key relevant concepts. In Section III, we discuss the concept of Digital Health Passports and their application in international tourism during an ongoing global pandemic. In Section IV we present in detail the DHP Blockchain framework; the involved actors, data structures and procedures. In Section V, we discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy. Finally, in Section VI, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols.",

In this context, WHO has identified the best strategy for monitoring and controlling a pandemic in a combination of large-scale testing, rigorous contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, in parallel with moderate (e.g., South Korea) or strong (e.g., China) social-distancing measures [10] , [13] .
