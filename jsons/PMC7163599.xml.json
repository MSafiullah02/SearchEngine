There is striking epidemiological evidence to suggest that environmental factors play a role in the development of MS 4. These factors include geographic variation in prevalence 3, altered susceptibility following relocation 5, 6, and discordance for clinical disease in a majority of monozygotic twins 6, 7. However, it has not been possible to define exactly which environmental factor(s) in association with a genetic predisposition result in the development of clinical disease 1, 3.",

In fact, Theiler's\u2010virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has been widely used as a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that consistently reproduces the symptomology of human disease 8.A coronavirus \u2014 murine hepatitis virus \u2014 has also been shown to cause a demyelinating disease of the CNS 9. Recent studies have suggested an association between infection with the human gammaherpesvirus, EBV, and the risk of MS. In one prospective epidemiological study, anti\u2010EBV antibody levels were elevated in women with MS, suggesting that EBV might be involved in the etiology of this autoimmune disease 10. This recent work supports previous studies that demonstrated increased anti\u2010EBV antibody titers in patients with MS 11. In addition, a particular T cell receptor from an MS patient recognized both a myelin\u2010basic\u2010protein peptide and a peptide derived from an EBV protein 12. These studies suggest a mechanism of molecular mimicry that might facilitate development of MS at some time after EBV infection.",

            "text": "A direct relationship between viral infection and the development of MS has been difficult to prove because of the reliance on human autopsy material or material taken from blood and spinal fluid. To circumvent such limitations, rodent models of MS have been developed and have contributed greatly to our understanding of the cellular and molecular events that occur during demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Relapsing EAE is a T\u2010helper\u2010cell\u2010 and macrophage\u2010mediated disease, characterized by inflammation and then demyelination within the CNS. The SJL mouse is often used as a model for such a disease, and active immunization with the immunodominant peptide of proteolipid protein (PLP 139\u2013151) induces relapsing EAE in these mice 13. EAE can also be induced by passive transfer of CD4+ encephalitogenic T lymphocytes into certain strains of mice 14 and rats 15. Such passive transfer of antigen\u2010specific T helper cells obviates the need to actively immunize mice, and allows studies of post\u2010immunization events in developing EAE. Passive transfer of encephalitogenic T lymphocytes into Lewis rats provides a reproducible non\u2010relapsing form of EAE that has been used to investigate the acute form of the disease 16.",

If \u03b3HV\u201068 did gain access to the CNS during clinical EAE, the presence of virus should not be difficult to detect. To address whether \u03b3HV\u201068 was present in the CNS, a sensitive, nested PCR procedure was performed to detect the presence of the DNA encoding \u03b3HV\u201068 gp150 in the spleens and spinal cords of infected mice, and infected mice undergoing clinical EAE. Fig. 2 shows the results of one such PCR where viral genomes were easily detectable in peripheral lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen), but not in the spinal cord of infected mice. This was true even when nested PCR was performed for 20 + 25 cycles, whereas such viral DNA sequences were abundant in the spleen using only 20 + 20 PCR cycles. Although qualitative, these differences in viral genome presence in the CNS versus peripheral lymphoid organs suggested that minimal viral replication or latency occurs in the CNS.",

Encephalitogenic T cell lines were established by immunizing Lewis rats with an encephalitogenic peptide of myelin basic protein as previously described 35\u201337. Groups of Lewis rats were untreated, exposed to UV\u2010inactivated \u03b3HV\u201068, or infected intranasally with 15,000 PFU of \u03b3HV\u201068. At the indicated times post\u2010infection, EAE was induced inthese rats by tail\u2010vein injection of the indicated number (3\u00d7106 or 3\u00d7107) of encephalitogenic T lymphocytes. Animals exposed to UV\u2010inactivated \u03b3HV\u201068 (<1 PFU per rat) were used as controls. Rats exposed to UV\u2010inactivated \u03b3HV\u201068 or \u03b3HV\u201068\u2010infected rats were coded and assessed daily for the development of EAE in a blinded fashion using the followingscale: 0, no evidence of disease; 1, flaccid tail; 2, hind limb paralysis; 3, lower\u2010body paralysis; 4, moribund. To confirm the antigen\u2010specific nature of the model, control groups of \u03b3HV\u201068\u2010infected rats received 3\u00d7106 Con\u2010A\u2010activated leukocytes expanded from a non\u2010immune Lewis rat.",
