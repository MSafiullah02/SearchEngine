The epidemiology of MS indicates that it may be triggered by a virus infection before the age of adolescence, but attempts to associate a speci\u00aec virus with MS have produced equivocal results. Many studies of the aetiology of MS have postulated that a persistent virus infection is involved, but transient virus infection may provide a plausible alternative mechanism that could explain many of the inconsistencies in MS research. The most studied animal model of MS is chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CREAE), which is induced in susceptible animals following injection of myelin components. While CREAE cannot provide information on the initiating factor for MS, it may mimic disease processes occurring after an initial trigger that may involve transient virus infection. The disease process may comprise separate triggering and relapse phases. The triggering phase may involve sensitisation to myelin antigens as a result of damage to oligodendrocytes or molecular mimicry. The relapse phase could be similar to CREAE, or alternatively relapses may be induced by further transient virus infections which may not involve infection of the CNS, but which may involve the recrudescence of anti-myelin autoimmunity.

The most studied autoimmune model of MS is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which may be induced in a number of animal species by immunisation with myelin antigens or transfer of myelin-reactive class II restricted CD4+ T lymphocytes [10] . The type of EAE induced is dependent on the immunisation protocol, animal strain and antigen used. In some cases the protocol results in an acute monophasic disease and in others a chronic relapsing disease (CREAE) occurs. CREAE resembles MS because animals develop accumulating neurological de\u00aecit following each disease phase. EAE is characterised by in\u00afammatory in\u00aeltration of the CNS associated with lesions of demyelination, and the topography of lesions within the CNS is dependent on the nature and origin of the autoantigen [28] . The extent of demyelination varies with the protocol used but is more pronounced when myelin-speci\u00aec antibodies are injected following transfer of MBP-speci\u00aec T cells or at the onset of spinal cord homogenate-induced disease [29, 30] . The possible role of anti-myelin antibodies is supported by the \u00aendings of myelin reactive antibodies in the blood of MS patients, and recently autoantibodies directed to myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) peptides have been detected within lesions of demyelination in the CNS of MS patients [31] . While antibodies may be involved in the development of demyelination, many other immunological mechanisms, including the release of in\u00afammatory mediators of disease such as TNF-a and reactive oxygen species, or the action of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, may play a role in the myelin damage [32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1108, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1440, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1734, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autoimmune models"}, {"text": "The chronicity of the disease both in CREAE and possibly MS may be due to the perpetuation of autoimmune responses by determinant spreading.

It was found many years ago that antibody levels to several common viruses are elevated in MS patients, but it is not clear whether this is related to the cause of MS or an epiphenomenon. Many viruses have been detected in CNS autopsy tissue from MS patients [13\u00b117] ( Table 2 ); many such claims have either been retracted or have not been con\u00aermed by other workers. The inconsistent detection of viruses in CNS autopsy tissue from MS patients is illustrated by a study in which brain samples from 8 cases of MS and 56 controls were examined by in situ hybridisation [54] . Samples were examined for genomic RNA sequences of measles virus, canine distemper virus, rubella virus and simian virus 5, all viruses that have been implicated in MS. Positive hybridisation was detected in two of the MS cases for measles virus only, but was also detected in one of the controls. The latter was a neurological control that was a case of disseminated CMV infection, but which showed demyelination that is uncharacteristic of CMV infection [54] . In subsequent investigation, the number of MS cases found to be positive for measles virus RNA has increased to 4 out of 14 cases examined (S. McQuaid and L. Cosby, unpublished data). In another study, measles virus RNA could not be detected by RT-PCR in peripheral blood leucocytes from MS patients [55] . Measles, mumps and rubella virus RNA has been shown to be absent from brain autopsy tissue from MS patients by RT-PCR [56] .

Also, if the damage were a result of virus infections, it may not be speci\u00aec to any one virus, as at least in experimental infection many infections may give rise to a similar pathology, suggesting that any virus (including non-neurotropic viruses) that induces myelin sensitisation could act as a trigger.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF PATHOGENESIS BASED ON TRANSIENT VIRUS INFECTION"}, {"text": "With regard to the activity of known human viruses in the induction of myelin damage, there is evidence that virus infections associated with CNS demyelination can cause damage to oligodendrocytes. Measles virus has been implicated in MS [54] , and virus infection of oligodendrocytes is seen in cases of SSPE [69] , which is a rare human demyelinating disease caused by a persistent infection with measles virus (Figure 2A) . Similarly, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare human demyelinating disease caused by persistent infection with a human papovavirus. This virus has also been implicated in MS [70] , and virus infection of oligodendrocytes is seen in this disease (Figure 2B) . In the SFV model, infection of oligodendrocytes occurs early in infection, and is followed by acute immune-mediated demyelination [71, 72] (Figure 2E, F) . Virus infection of oligodendrocytes by SFV is also seen in rat mixed glial cell cultures [73] (Figure 2C, D) . The damage to oligodendrocytes induced by SFV infection may be due to induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis, since this is induced in cultured rat oligodendrocytes infected by SFV [74] . However, it has also been proposed that some mature oligodendrocytes in the animal survive SFV infection, and are capable of carrying out the remyelination observed later in the disease [75] . Such virus-infected oligodendrocytes could be targeted by CD8+ T-lymphocytes [49] , which would also result in myelin damage. Rubella virus, a togavirus like SFV, and another virus that has been implicated in MS [76] , shows tropism for oligodendrocytes in rat mixed glial cell cultures [77] . In canine distemper, which is a disease of dogs caused by a virus that has also been implicated in MS in the past [13] , damage to oligodendrocytes also occurs, although this does not appear to be associated with productive virus infection, which mainly occurs in astrocytes [78, 79] . Lymphoproliferative responses to MBP have been detected in patients with encephalitis after measles virus, VZV or rubella virus infection, and after rabies vaccination [80] . In the case of measles virus, a T cell-mediated response to MBP was induced following intracerebral infection of rats; such sensitised T-cells showed no crossreactivity to measles virus, but could induce EAE by adoptive transfer to na\u00f5 \u00c8ve recipients. Also, a normally non-encephalitogenic MBP peptide induced EAE in measles virus-infected rats [37] .
