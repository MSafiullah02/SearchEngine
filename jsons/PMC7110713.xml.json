In a recent case study, MERS-CoV shedding from the respiratory tract was detected until day 24 of illness.4 In this study we investigated the viral shedding of MERS-CoV in the respiratory secretions of patients who were ill and those with mild disease who underwent repeated testing.",

In previous case reports, MERS-CoV was isolated from the respiratory tract secretions up to day 24 in one patient,4 and day 18 in another.6 In this large retrospective analysis, cases had more prolonged viral shedding from the respiratory tract than contacts. The difference is related to the severity of the disease and the significant underlying comorbidities among the cases. However, the study did not examine viral shedding systematically and thus patients with more severe disease may have been selected for repeat testing rather than those who had milder disease. A systematic and prospective study is required to further delineate the kinetics of MERS-CoV, not only in respiratory secretions but also in other body fluids (blood, urine, and stool). The reporting of these data is important to further characterize the pathogenesis of this disease and for better application of the infection prevention and control measures required. The need to quantify the viral load is also very important for any recommendations regarding the need for isolation of those who continue to have positive MERS-CoV by PCR. The presence of viral RNA in respiratory secretions may indicate a replicating or a dead virus.",

We have previously shown that lower respiratory tract samples yield higher MERS-CoV viral loads and genome fractions than upper respiratory tract samples.7 Since cases had lower respiratory tract samples collected more often than upper respiratory tract samples, this indicates that cases were more ill and probably shed virus much longer. This finding, if confirmed by the prospective systematic collection of respiratory samples, would highlight the importance of applying prolonged infection control measures in severely ill patients with MERS-CoV in the healthcare setting. The pattern of transmission of MERS-CoV is well characterized as sporadic, intra-familial, and healthcare-associated.8, 9, 10 The transmission of MERS-CoV within healthcare facilities was noted in the Al-Hasa outbreak,11 and of 95 cases in one report, 63.2% were healthcare-associated and 13.7% were intra-familial transmission.12 In support of the low infectivity of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases is the finding of a low transmission rate within family contacts.13\n",
