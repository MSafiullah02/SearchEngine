            "text": "The evidence on COVID-19 risk factors derives largely from the adult population. Four case series, all from Wuhan, China, of adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19 did not list asthma as an underlying pre-existing condition in any of those patients. (12, (15) (16) (17) In a large case series of 1099 adult patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, asthma was not listed as a pre-existing condition in any of the patients described. (18) In contrast, recent data released from the CDC of U.S. hospitalizations in March,2020 notes that 27.3% of adults 18-49 years of age who were hospitalized with COVID-19 had a history of asthma.(3) In adults aged 50-64 years of age hospitalized for COVID-19 asthma was present in 13.2% and in those 65 years or older asthma was present in 12.9%.(3,19) As a result, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) notes that 'those with asthma in the 18-49 year old age range may be at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19.' (19) Although there is a paucity of literature on pediatric risk factors, the case series to date from Wuhan on hospitalized pediatric cases don't list asthma as a pre-existing risk factor for morbidity or mortality. (10, 11) It is further reassuring that children appear to be at lower risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than the adult population in general, although severe infection still can occur. (13, 20) The CDC morbidity and mortality report notes that among the 149,082 reported U.S. cases of COVID-19 for which age is known, only 2572 (1.7%) occurred in children 18 years and younger.(3) Although among the patients with information on underlying conditions, 23% had at least one underlying condition such as asthma, only 5.7% of children infected with COVID-19 required hospitalization (compared with 10% of adults aged 18-64 years) and only 3 deaths were reported in children (<1% of pediatric cases). In a case series from China of 72,000 cases, approximately 1% were children aged 0 to 18 years of age with only 1 death reported in the adolescent population (and none in children under the age of 10 years). (13, 21) Another risk in children with asthma is that infection with COVID-19 could trigger a viral- In summary, based on available information to date, it is unclear whether there is a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity among asthmatic children. (8, 9) It is also unknown whether asthma medications such as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or asthma biological therapies pose a risk in managing COVID-19 infections. Before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, larger scale data are required from pediatric populations, and from heterogeneous locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. It also remains unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of asthma exacerbations. As a result, good asthma control is essential as a precautionary measure during this time. (8, 9, 13, 20) ",

(27) The best way to prevent an exacerbation is consistent proper use of medicines to control asthma, such as inhaled corticosteroids and/or montelukast. As a result, children should remain on their current asthma medications during COVID-19. (8, 9) This recommendation is supported by multiple international organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control, the Global Initiative for Asthma, and the North American consensus guideline on allergy care during COVID. (8, 9, 28, 29) It is recommended that children not 'step down' any controller medication during this time unless 'this is clearly favorable from an individual standpoint, with careful consideration of the balance between benefit and harm/burden.'(8) Other recommendations to maintain asthma control include avoiding known asthma triggers such as aeroallergens, frequent handwashing, physical distancing, and regular review of inhaler technique. (9, 29) An exacerbation, if it occurred, 'could require [children] to enter the healthcare system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.' (8) Some biologic agents, such as omalizumab (anti-IgE) and mepolizumab (anti-IL5), are approved for use in moderate to severe asthma in adolescents(30) The current recommendation for adolescents who are using these medications is to continue their use. (8) There is no current evidence that use of these medications increases the risk of COVID-19 infection or morbidity.",

(39) In many cases, such as with albuterol, these medications increasingly are being used in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to help with respiratory issues. To help combat the shortage of albuterol specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic albuterol inhaler on April 8,2020. (44) If faced with albuterol shortage, other available options include substituting other short acting beta-agonists, using an expired albuterol inhaler, and ensuring good asthma control which reduces the need for reliever medications in general. (9, 39) Many of the substitute short acting beta-agonists are dry powder inhalers (diskus or turbuhaler) and as such children often need to be at least 6 years of age to produce enough inspiratory force to use these devices properly. (9, 45) For adolescents 12 years and older, another option is ICS-formoterol for both maintenance and relief therapy as supported by the Global Initiative for Asthma 2019 update. (46, 47) Nebulized albuterol should only be considered as a last resort, and proper infection prevention protocols need to be followed.

It has been suggested that exposure to second-hand smoke increases COVID-19 morbidity. (52, 53) Of those hospitalized in the US for COVID-19, data from the CDC indicates that 33.1% were non-Hispanic black, while they only make up 18% of the catchment area population.(3) A recent editorial notes that low-income families are at higher risk of COVID-19 as low income jobs mostly can't be performed remotely, often don't pay sick days, are often not associated with insurance benefits and as a result it may not be possible for these families to afford the steps necessary for physical distancing. (54) Although the relationships between these variables needs to be further elucidated, it is possible that measures that impact social determinants of health, such as reducing exposure to second-hand smoke or improving healthcare access in low income neighborhoods, may improve prognosis in children with asthma who contract COVID-19. In addition, these families could benefit from counseling on having the appropriate amount of medications available for home during this period of restricted travel.

It is possible that children may not be severely affected by SARS-CoV-2 for some undefined reason to date, but they can still be carriers and could transmit virus to vulnerable people, including elderly relatives. Therefore, social distancing has included children, which has necessitated discontinuing school. It remains to be determined what impact this step has on children including those children with asthma. Often parents will discontinue medications in children during the summer months because they are doing well and they are out of school.(55) However, this year is different, because school was discontinued during the spring season, a time of seasonal allergen exacerbation and viral infection. School adds a certain structure to the day and there is some level of administration of asthma medication administration around the school day. Clinicians and parents should observe for potential breakdowns in adherence to controlling medications, especially in families in chaotic circumstances. The impact on education of home schooling, especially in families that lack an organizational structure remains to be seen. Finally, it has been suggested that school closure will increase the risk of childhood obesity, a known risk factor for worsening asthma. (56) Whether this occurs, and how this influences asthma control, also is yet unknown.",

There is minimal literature on this risk from COVID-19, but there are data on the risk of asthma exacerbations triggered from other coronavirus infections, with mixed findings. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, did not cause an increase in asthma exacerbations in children during the 2002 epidemic, nor induce bronchial hyperreactivity or eosinophilic inflammation.(22) In fact, paradoxically, asthma exacerbations actually decreased during that time, which was attributed to improvements in hygiene measures related to the epidemic.(22) However, in contrast, nonepidemic coronaviruses are found commonly in the respiratory tracts of children with an asthma exacerbation and have contributed to bronchial hyper-reactivity and eosinophilicinflammation.(23)(24)(25)(26)",

It must also be considered that nebulized viral droplets can persist in the air for hours.(39)",

            "text": "Virtual visits. With the need for significant healthcare resource reallocation, as well as shortages of PPE, much of the allergy/immunology specialty has converted to largely virtual visits, or visit deferral, during COVID-19.(8) Due to the need for almost exclusively virtual visits at this time, having a peak flow meter in homes may be helpful to diagnose an acute exacerbation at home, by comparing baseline measurements with those during highly symptomatic times. There are several advantages to virtual visits, including access to specialists,removing the transportation barrier required for an in-person visit, allowing those too sick to travel to connect with a healthcare provider, and most importantly in the current context, prevention of infection transmission with in-person visits.(48) Virtual visits should be prioritized for children who have poorly controlled asthma, have worsening asthma symptoms, or who have required dose escalations of their asthma medications in the past several months' time.(8) It is recommended that follow-up visits for children with mild-to-moderate or well-controlled asthma be postponed during COVID-19, or converted to virtual visits if time permits.(8) It also is recommended that children of any asthma severity who have been well controlled for the past 6-12 months (no ER visits, <1 OCS dose, <2 exacerbations in the past 6-12 months) have visits deferred or converted to virtual visits (time permitting).(8) For children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations, an in-person visit likely is necessary but as noted in the joint North American guideline on COVID-19 and allergy contingency planning, 'If the allergy/ immunology office does not have PPE available, it would be recommended that no patients with a co-potential for an asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 be seen at that office; the patient should instead be seen at another facility capable of COVID-19 isolation which is staffed and equipped to assess and manage asthma.'(8) Recommendations may be adjusted over time, based on the duration of COVID-19 and the time required for physical distancing. Asthma Clinical Trials. It is currently recommended that entry into any asthma clinical trial be suspended during COVID-19.(8) For asthmatic children already participating in clinical trials, consideration could be given to virtual visits if possible.(8) Procedures that require forced expiratory maneuvers such as spirometry, methacholine challenge or induced sputum samples should be postponed in order to minimize staff risk and potential room contamination.",
