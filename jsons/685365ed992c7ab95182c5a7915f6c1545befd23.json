Alp Ikizler N ovel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered transmissible disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, primarily manifesting as an acute upper and lower respiratory tract illness that may be complicated by interstitial and alveolar pneumonia. It may also affect multiple other tissues such as the heart, digestive tract, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. 1 The rapidly spreading outbreak, which first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of individuals affected by the disease increases by the day and there are several resources that provide up-to-date epidemiologic data. 2 Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and its complications for several reasons. Many MHD patients are of older age and have certain comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease, as well as an underlying immune-compromised state, that are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. 3 The logistical aspects of MHD further increase the risk for disease transmission, such as recurrent physical presence at health care facilities and physical proximity of patients during hemodialysis. It is therefore crucial to rapidly use appropriate preventive strategies in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. This summary is aimed at providing up-to-date scientific information about COVID-19 as it relates to MHD patients and highlighting the strategies to minimize its spread in outpatient hemodialysis facilities.",

            "text": "What Do We Know About COVID-19 and MHD Patients? Notably, the scientific response to this pandemic has been swift. For example, a search in Google Scholar retrieves more than 1,000 records since the initial report by WHO. 4 Despite this abundant number of publications, it is difficult to differentiate the most useful information that would help patient care efforts. Most of the information about the scientific aspects of how COVID-19 affects MHD patients is in the form of preliminary reports that have not yet completed a peer-review process. This is not unexpected because the disease has not yet reached a peak in most parts of the world and the data are still being accumulated. Almost all data are from the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan and more recently from Italy, and the reports are being put together through heroic efforts of nephrologists who are under immense pressure, primarily to provide clinical care for scores of infected patients. Accordingly, it is not yet possible to accurately describe the incidence of COVID-19 infection in MHD patients. It is also not possible to provide detailed information regarding the clinical course of the disease in MHD patients. Nevertheless, the information that has been put forward from the Northwest Kidney Centers indicated that the first reported death in the United States was a patient receiving MHD before infection (S. Watnick, personal communication, March 2020). At this time, there are some scattered reports that suggest that a handful of people who have become COVID-19 positive are receiving MHD, but there are no reports of any widespread transmission among MHD patients.",

Common current diagnostic criteria include upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, radiologic findings on computed tomography of the chest such as ground glass opacities, and confirmation of the presence of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in different biospecimens. Interestingly, a recent study examining detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens indicated that positivity was as low as 32% in pharyngeal swabs, with lower respiratory tract samples most often testing positive for the virus (in up to 93%). 5 Currently, most patients are diagnosed using clinical criteria, although significant efforts are being placed on rapid high-throughput testing. 6 and American Society of Nephrology 7 websites.

Although the CDC guidance recommends use of face masks only for patients with symptoms or illness, certain large dialysis organizations have mandated their use by every MHD patient at every session, which may have important resource implications. Ideally, symptomatic patients should be dialyzed in a separate room (if available) with the door closed. If a separate room is not available, it is recommended that the treatment should be performed at a corner or end-of-row station, away from the main flow of traffic. In any case, the symptomatic patient should be separated by at least 6 feet from the nearest patient in all directions.

Current data suggest that the illness will become more widespread in the coming weeks. The actions taken by government officials to promote social distancing, such as closing of schools, sporting events, and other businesses, are appropriate and encouraging steps. These somewhat onerous but necessary actions have resulted in reasonable control of the disease in several countries such as Taiwan. There are other lessons that outpatient hemodialysis facilities can learn from this pandemic, including the need for continuous and comprehensive data collection and the value of flexibility by regulatory agencies. Academic centers and large dialysis organizations should rapidly create data collection tools that can complement the basic clinical data collected by CDC and state health departments. Only then will we have reliable information to get ourselves prepared for the next inevitable epidemic. Regulatory agencies should allow temporary changes in telehealth regulations and patient care regulations such as allowing patients to swiftly move between health systems. To improve our responsiveness to emerging threats in the future, we also need reliable and comprehensive scientific data along with flexible regulatory guidance.",
