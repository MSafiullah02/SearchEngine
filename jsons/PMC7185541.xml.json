Here, we present the results of a new systematic search of the literature (table 1; appendix). We identified 124 cases, the majority of which were published as case reports, with the remaining reported as case series. Laboratory evidence of infection (such as isolation of the organism in the serum, or viral DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) was reported in 85 of the cases (69%). A robust temporal association between the infection and catatonia was reported in 82 of the cases (66%). A previous psychiatric disorder was recorded in 16 cases (13%) and a previous medical disorder in 26 cases (21%), although the absence of a pre-existing condition was often not stated. Only 66 of the cases (53%) recorded the presence of at least two features from the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI); the remainder had insufficient description or only one feature.10 In some cases, the catatonia resolved with antimicrobial therapy,11 but in others, it required treatment with benzodiazepines12 or ECT.13\n",

Psychomotor activity is also slowed in mild experimentally induced infection.21 This might be due to impaired spatial memory performance and aberrant activity in parts of the brain involved in interoception.

            "text": "The acute-phase response is a core part of the innate immune system. The response is initiated by the activation of monocytes and macrophages by a stimulus, such as muscle breakdown, infection, physical injury, or psychological stress. In response to these stimuli, cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which in turn act on receptors throughout the body to promote fever, anorexia, muscle catabolism, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Importantly, these cytokines also alter protein synthesis in the liver, causing increased production of acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, and fibrinogen.36, 37 Some features of malignant catatonia bear notable similarities to the acute-phase response, including fever, motor hypoactivity, and autonomic disturbance. Here, we include a summary of the evidence for the presence of systemic inflammation, as measured by acute-phase reactants and related proteins (table 3\n). Creatine kinase (CK) is not an acute-phase marker, but as it is a marker of muscle breakdown, the enzyme is sometimes raised as a downstream consequence of the acute-phase response. The evidence for CK elevation in catatonia is equivocal and could be argued to be the result of muscular rigidity and excessive immobilisation rather than indicating a primary muscular pathology. In one study, a raised CK predicted a good response to treatment with lorazepam.45\n",

            "text": "The mainstay of current treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines and ECT, neither of which is classically understood as an immunomodulatory therapy. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators at the \u03b3-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)-A receptor. Although research into the function of GABA in the immune system is at an early stage, evidence suggests that GABAergic signalling has a role in suppression of immune responses.53 Lymphocytes express GABA-A receptors, and activation of these receptors reduces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.53 However, one study specifically on catatonia found higher monocyte counts predicted benzodiazepine non-response.39 Data distinguishing different benzodiazepines are sparse, but some benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and lorazepam (both recognised treatments for catatonia) but not clonazepam, also bind to translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial protein associated with phagocyte activity, immune cell migration, and cytokine function.54, 55 In rats, diazepam reduces TSPO in the brain and decreases the number of CNS inflammatory cells, giving it a protective function against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.55 Reports on other GABA-A receptor modulators are scarce, but epidemiological studies exist that indicate that zolpidem use is associated with higher rates of infections (including of pyelonephritis, which would be unlikely to be related to respiratory depression), suggesting the drug might also have an immunosuppressant role.56, 57\n",

Given that the disorder bears several similarities to catatonia, one author has suggested testing for GAD2 autoantibodies to distinguish between the two disorders.28 The syndromes share immobility, an emotionless facial expression, and marked anxiety. Moreover, hypertonic episodes in stiff person syndrome can have psychological triggers.67 As with catatonia, the mainstay of treatment for stiff person syndrome is benzodiazepines; however, immunotherapy in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids and the anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody rituximab are increasingly used. A stiff person syndrome variant, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, responds dramatically to immunosuppression.67, 68\n",

As far as adaptive immunity is concerned, the specificity of the antigen might be the most important determinant of the resulting neuropsychiatric phenotype, including catatonia. The downstream effect of immune activation is dependent on the antigen targeted. Autoimmune neurological disorders present differently depending on the target for autoantibodies or T cells; frequently these targets are neurotransmitter receptors with ensuing downstream effects on receptor dysfunction. In autoimmune encephalitis, the presentation depends on the specific antibodies present.115 In the specific case of NMDAR encephalitis, often little evidence exists of complement activation and neuronal degeneration.116 The fact that ketamine and phencyclidine\u2014both NMDAR antagonists\u2014cause catatonia117 suggests that NMDAR antagonism is responsible, the implication being that NMDAR antibody encephalitis is more usefully understood as a synaptopathy. Genetic hypofunction of the NMDAR due to GRIN1 mutation also appears to predispose to psychosis.118 Similarly, benzodiazepine withdrawal presents similarly to GABA-A receptor encephalitis.119, 120\n",

In mice, the NMDAR antagonist dizocilpine (also known as MK-801) shows a bimodal effect on grooming and rearing behaviour: at low doses, this behaviour is suppressed, but as the dose increases, behaviour normalises, before being suppressed again at higher doses.124, 125 This effect might explain why catatonia is characterised not only by immobility, but also occasionally by catatonic excitement. An explanation for this finding might rely on the knowledge that the NMDAR is expressed by excitatory glutamatergic neurons and by inhibitory GABAergic neurons.126 Moreover, both reduced and excessive NMDAR activity can result in neuronal apoptosis,127 but at physiological levels can also promote neuronal survival.128\n",

Moreover, whether any peripheral inflammation in catatonia arises secondary to immobility and muscle breakdown is unknown. Examining the association of catatonia with the adaptive immune system reveals a strong and specific association with NMDAR encephalitis, which can cause the full range of catatonic features. This finding suggests that adaptive immunity can cause catatonia through action at specific extracellular antigens, rather than immune activation per se. Additionally, this illustrates the importance of glutamatergic function in catatonia. As more autoimmune disorders are characterised, more cases of catatonia might be explained in this way.",
