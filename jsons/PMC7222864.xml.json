Despite studies showing that nonoperative treatment is associated with worse outcomes [3], operative rates remain low in resource-constrained settings [4, 5]. As explained by Nwanko and Uche [5] in Nigeria as well as Ametefe and colleagues [6] in Ghana, implant cost is the principle reason surgery cannot be performed. While many authors have described operative treatment of TSI in LMICs [6\u201310], less is known about those who do not undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention can potentially mitigate tragic disability, thus an appraisal of who is not undergoing surgery is necessary to advance spine trauma care in LMICs.",

Any patient under the age of 14 or with a concomitant brain injury was excluded. During the study period, no official spine trauma protocol was in place, and both the decision to operate and the surgical plan was based on three factors: (1) the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate surgery, (2) availability of spinal implants, and (3) the patient\u2019s financial resources to pay for spinal implants. Of these reasons, an inability to pay for spinal implants was the driving factor, as described previously [11]. The current study represents an extension of a prior series, and though nonoperative treatment was the focus of the current manuscript, operative cases were included to serve only as a comparison group [11]. Moreover, while implants require payment, certain ICU services were delivered regardless of cost, including: vasopressors, arterial blood gasses, and ventilator treatment. That said, certain laboratory tests and all imaging required payment.",

Patients with public insurance were required to pay for hospital services before receiving them, while private patients were not required to provide payment upfront. Prehospital care was described by distance from injury site to MOI (km), prior outside hospital (OSH) admission (yes/no), and days from injury to MOI admission. Fracture type was defined using the AO Classification System (A0\u20134, B1\u20133, C) [12]. Patients with traumatic disk herniation or central cord syndrome were classified as A0. Central cord syndrome was defined by radiographic and/or clinical presence of a cervical SCI without ongoing compression, which most often occurred after acute trauma in the setting of preexisting spondylosis and a narrowed canal. We acknowledge that the definition of central cord syndrome is controversial, and cases of spondylosis with active compression due to a fracture, disc herniation, ligamentum flavum, or facet arthropathy, were not defined as central cord syndrome in the present study. Only cervical SCI without evidence of an actively compressed spinal cord was considered central cord syndrome. Level of injury was recorded as axial cervical (occiput-C2), subaxial cervical (C3-C7), thoracic (T1\u2013T12), or lumbar (L1\u2013L5). If the injured levels included C7 and T1 or T12 and L1, the level of injury was classified as cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar, respectively. Instances with multiple spine injuries were classified according to the more severe level. Neurologic status upon admission and discharge was determined according to the International Neurological Classification of Spinal Injury using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale [13]. Improvement or decline in neurologic status were defined by change in at least one ASIA grade during the hospital stay.",

Outcomes of nonoperative vs. operative management were compared using multivariate regression controlling for age, gender, insurance status, mechanism of injury, fracture stability (as defined above), injury level, and exam on admission (ASIA grade). Logistic regression was used for neurologic improvement, pressure ulcers, and mortality, while linear regression was used for length of stay. Predictors of nonoperative treatment were determined by univariate followed by multivariate logistic regression, controlling for age, gender, mechanism of injury, and exam on admission (ASIA grade). Any variable <0.10 on univariate analysis was entered into the multivariate regression. Due to multiple comparisons in the predictors of nonoperative care model (9), a Bonferroni correction was applied, and results were considered significant if p < 0.006.

Of the 61 patients with potentially unstable fractures (A0\u2013A3), 34% were neurologically intact (ASIA E), and thus conservative management was acceptable. Electing to brace patients when possible helps save spinal implants for the most severe injuries and is a judicious use of expensive supplies. Surgery also has its own set of risks. One study from India of 192 TSI patients, 19% of which underwent surgery, found that surgery was associated with five times the odds of developing a complication, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and reoperation [14]. These results highlight that nonoperative management of less severe fractures without neurologic deficits should be pursued whenever possible.",

Given that the average time of death was 8.1 days post admission, these were not polytrauma patients who died shortly after arrival, where little could be done. The high rate of mortality among nonoperative patients is similar to prior studies. In northeast Tanzania, Rashid et al. [4] described a series of 125 TSI patients, 98% of whom were treated nonoperatively, with a mortality rate of 24%. Cervical injuries accounted for 72% of deaths. Obalum et al. [15] reported an 18% mortality rate among 468 TSI patients at a Nigerian center; likewise, 72% of deaths occurred in patients with cervical injuries. Lastly, Moshi et al. [16] in Tanzania found a 24% mortality rate in 213 TSI patients\u201446% of deaths were from cervical trauma and 10% of deaths were in patients with central cord syndrome. Unfortunately, there was no mention of whether patients were managed operatively or nonoperatively in the latter two studies. In LMIC centers, not undergoing surgery appears to be tightly associated with increased risk of mortality. Due to the present study design, we cannot definitively say why the increased risk of mortality was seen. One possibility is that patients did not undergo the needed spinal cord decompression in a timely fashion, resulting in compromised neurologic, respiratory, and/or autonomic function, leading to death from downstream causes of the initial SCI. Alternatively, intensive care resources might not have been adequate to support patients with SCI, specifically the need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation.",

[9] in Cambodia performed stabilizations for 79% of thoracic/lumbar injuries compared with 68% of cervical injuries. Nwankwo and Uche [5] in Nigeria stabilized 19% of lumbar injuries, but only 9% of cervical injuries. Ametefe et al. [6] in Ghana treated 52% of thoracic injuries and 82% of lumbar injuries, compared with only 38% of cervical injuries. Though at first glance, this may seem counterintuitive, it is more common for these severe cervical injuries to not be operated on due to late presentation, the severity of neurologic deficits, poor prognosis, and complexity of the indicated surgery. Our finding could represent several phenomena. First, a dearth of cervical implants could exist, namely lateral mass screws, cervical cages, and most importantly set screws, which anecdotally appear to be the scarcest resource. The same can be said for finer instruments needed for anterior approaches, such as small, sharp curettes, and kerrisons [6, 17]. Second, high cervical injuries are more complex, with critical structures such as the vertebral artery, lower brainstem, and cranial nerves at play. Additional training may be required for these procedures, especially craniocervical surgery, as only 1 of 11 patients with craniocervical injuries underwent surgery in the current series. Third, there was a trend toward nonoperative management of central cord syndrome. Despite evidence that these patients benefit from early decompression [18, 19], treatment for central cord syndrome is still debated, and nonoperative care is sometimes preferred [20], which likely explains these results. Decompressing patients with central cord syndrome may be a reasonable option to pursue, especially in absence of fracture or instability, as a laminectomy could be all that is needed.",

Nwankwo and Uche [5] in Nigeria were only able to operate on 57% of 30 patients with surgical indications because patients were unable to afford implants. Similarly, Ametefe et al. [6] in Ghana mentioned that cost of surgery accounted for operating on only 47% of 185 patients with TSI. Even worse, in an operative series of 146 TSI patients by Lehre et al. [7] in Ethiopia, neither the patients nor the hospital could afford implants, forcing them to rely entirely on donations. Seeking solutions, some LMIC centers have employed cost-effective methods of spinal fixation, such as the Adeolu technique in Nigeria, where stabilization is achieved with a modified Rush nail as a vertical strut secured to the spine with sublaminar cerclage wire [21]. The same authors used this technique in 30 patients with TSI, and 94% of patients were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d or \u201csatisfied\u201d with the procedure [8, 22]. Wiring for cervical injuries and Luque rods for multilevel thoracic and lumbar fixation have also been used [9]. Interestingly, in a Cambodian series [9], five patients underwent cervical laminoplasty, which is a cost-effective treatment for certain central cord syndrome when only decompression is needed. For patients who can afford implants, the delay to accumulate sufficient funds directly increased length of stay, as reflected in the current series where operative patients remained in the hospital for 9 days longer.",

Although donations bolster short-term supply, they are not a sustainable solution. We encourage hospitals to negotiate with vendors for low-cost implants, and governments to restructure insurance programs to cover operative TSI care.Pursue educational training on cervical surgery. Symposiums and educational conferences are more frequently being held in LMICs. Future demonstrations should emphasize placement of cervical instrumentation, especially at the craniocervical junction.Emphasize operative treatment for central cord syndrome. The incidence of central cord syndrome will continue to grow with an aging population [23]. Surgeons should be aware of incomplete injuries in older patients without fracture or dislocation, and offer surgical decompression as a treatment option. That said, the hospital should have the needed resources to treat these postoperative patients, which can be complex, including ICU care, vasopressors, ventilators, and experienced nursing.Augment ICU care to support airway and blood pressure management. When possible, ICUs should staff a neuro-intensivist to provide care to TSI patients in the acute setting and be cognizant of the neurologic, respiratory, and/or autonomic dysfunction that will occur.Provide basic education on spine trauma management to regional hospitals. Nearly all TSI patients are stalled for several days at regional hospitals before being transferred to tertiary centers [24]. Teaching basic physical exam and immobilization techniques would streamline referral to larger institutions for definitive management.Implement a spine trauma protocol that treats all patients regardless of cost. Eliminating the financial requirement for spinal implants has potential to improve outcomes and decrease lengths of stay.",

Follow-up information was not collected, so it is unknown how nonoperative treatment impacted long-term neurologic status and radiographic healing. Also, the results may be difficult to generalize to other neurosurgery and orthopedic departments in LMICs, because each institution has a unique set of available resources that dictate operative decision-making. Several important variables could not be controlled for, including comorbidities and socioeconomic status. Ideally, each patient could be directly asked about their employment status, individual income, family income, and education level; however, this was not feasible, and insurance status was used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic factors are especially important because patients with more financial resources can pay for better care, expensive implants, and rehabilitation resources, such as wheelchairs. For these reasons, socioeconomic factors can interact heavily with many outcomes. Regarding comorbidities, although the majority of patients were young males without medical problems, older, sicker patients have decreased physiologic reserve and are less likely to survive a devastating SCI. Comorbidities, unfortunately, were not assessed. In addition, determination of central cord syndrome was defined by radiographic or clinical evidence of cervical SCI without ongoing compression and assessed retrospectively. MRI scans were not available on all patients, which means that retrospectively diagnosing patients with central cord syndrome was at times an approximation and educated guess without complete imaging. Finally, determination of surgical indication is a complex process, and doing this retrospectively without access to a detailed patient history and complete imaging, may have led to misclassifications.",
