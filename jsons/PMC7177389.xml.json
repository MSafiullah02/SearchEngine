The virus typically spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets produced during coughing, and common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath2. The COVID-19 outbreak was initially identified in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and has since spread rapidly globally. It was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO)3. As of 26 March 2020, a total number of 480446 cumulative cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 175 countries and regions, including 22030 confirmed deaths, the majority of which have been reported in Italy (7503), Spain (4089) and China (3169)4. In Spain, as of 25 March 2020, most of those who have died were elderly, about 96% of deaths were in those over 60 years old, and 45% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease (31%)5.",
