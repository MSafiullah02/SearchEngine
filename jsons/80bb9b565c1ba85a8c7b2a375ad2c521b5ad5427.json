Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection, self-limited flu-like symptoms, to severe acute pneumonia with high mortality. Whereas the lung is the primary target in this pandemic disease, other organs can be affected, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, heart, blood, and kidneys. 1 Acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ damage, which are responsible for most mortalities, are thought to be mediated by an acute release of inflammatory cytokines, representing cytokine release syndrome. 2 Reports from China have highlighted frequent kidney involvement in COVID-19, and this was associated which increased mortality. 3, 4 In a prospective cohort of 401 COVID-19 patients, 44% of patients had proteinuria, 27% had hematuria, 14% had elevated serum creatinine on admission, and 5.1% had acute kidney injury (AKI) during admission; all of these renal abnormalities were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. 3 In another study, 59% had proteinuria, 44% hematuria, and 10% elevated serum creatinine on admission. 4 Proposed mechanisms for AKI include hypoperfusion-induced tubular injury associated with sepsis and cytokine storm, and direct tubular cell toxicity by the virus. 5 The latter is supported by the findings of a recent postmortem study that analyzed the renal pathologic abnormalities in 26 COVID-19 patients. 6 A third of patients had clinical evidence of elevated serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. Prominent acute tubular injury was seen by light microscopy, viral particles were detected within tubular epithelial cells and podocytes by electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was positive in tubular cells.",

CG can be primary or associated with a wide variety of infectious agents, inflammatory conditions (such as systemic lupus and hemophogocytic syndrome), malignancies, glomerular ischemic insult (associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, cholesterol embolization, or sickle cell disease), genetic mutations, and drugs (such as pamidronate and interferon) (Figure 1) . 8 hypoalbuminemia. In two of them, the AKI coincided with moderate respiratory symptoms (without associated sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome) S6, S8 , but interestingly in the third patient, AKI occurred one week after recovery from mild respiratory symptoms S7 . Despite improvement of pulmonary symptoms, AKI did not recover in two patients, who needed dialysis at discharge. These observations suggest that kidney involvement is independent of lung involvement. Histologically, severe CG, prominent acute tubular injury, diffuse podocyte foot process effacement and endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were present. Saharan African descent, and the two tested had APOL1 high risk genotype, suggesting that this genotype is an important risk factor, similar to CG associated with HIV and other viruses. S4 It has been previously shown that APOL1 expression is upregulated by viral infections and other inflammatory diseases that activate the Toll-like receptor-3. S10 Viral infections stimulate host interferon production, and interferon is a potent stimulus to APOL1 gene expression. S10 Thus, it appears likely that, in African Americans, SARS-CoV-2 infection acts as a \"second hit\" that leads to podocyte dysregulation and injury leading to CG. ",

Other viruses including cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus have been also linked to CG. S4 A major genetic contributor to risk for glomerulosclerosis and particularly to CG, regardless of etiology, among patients of African ancestry is the presence of APOL1 high risk genotype (carriage of G1/G1, G1/G2, or G2/G2 genotypes). How these APOL1 risk alleles alter podocyte biology, phenotype and function is not fully understood. Various mechanisms have been proposed from kidney biopsy studies, transgenic mouse studies, and cell culture studies. These include opening of plasma membrane cation channels, impaired mitochondrial function, altered endolysosomal trafficking, inflammasome activation, protein kinase R activation and most recently, through interference with APOL3 control of actomyosin in podocytes. S5 In this issue of Kidney International Reports, Larsen et al. S6 and Peleg et al. S7 independently report two patients with CG associated with COVID-19. Simultaneously, a third case of CG associated with COVID-19 is being reported by Kissling et al. S8 in Kidney International. One of the authors (SHN) is also aware of more than a dozen additional cases that have not been reported yet. The three reported patients all presented with severe AKI, heavy proteinuria, and",

Coronavirus particles were observed by electron microscopy within the cytoplasm of podocytes in the CG patient reported by Kissling et al.S8  and by postmortem examination of COVID-19 patients who had AKI and proteinuria 6 , supporting direct viral infection of podocyte. This is not surprising since podocytes (and tubular cells) express membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) S9 , the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, direct toxic viral effect on podocytes, as occurs in HIV-associated nephropathy, is possible in some cases. However, in the two other reported cases of COVID-19-associated CG, in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA failed to show viral RNA in the kidney and no viral inclusions were seen in renal tissue by electron microscopy S6, S7 , arguing against viral infection. The authors postulated that CG could be a consequence of the cytokine release syndrome characteristic of COVID-19 patients.

The two plausible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes CG are direct toxic viral effect on podocytes and/or virus-induced cytokine injury to podocytes. Genetic susceptibility, particularly the presence of high risk APOL1 genotypes likely play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this entity among African-descent individuals. Further work is needed to define the clinico-pathologic characteristics, outcome, and the role of antiviral therapy and corticosteroids for treatment of this lesion, and to understand the molecular mechanisms of podocyte injury by SARS-CoV-2.",
