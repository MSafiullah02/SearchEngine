Several diseases were discovered in America which included smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus, whooping cough, the mumps, and diphtheria. Infectious disease was the main reason for the demise of the Indians [2] . In the early 1980's, some homosexual men in the United States were diagnosed with a type of fungal infection and a tumor called Candidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma respectively.

On a normal basis, these CD4+ T-lymphocytes or T-cells detect foreign and infected cells, and attack, spread and kill them [1] [2] [3] . HIV is able to infect CD4+ T-lymphocytes and insert its genome to host genome. This integrated HIV genome may exist in 2 states. They can be either transcriptionally active generating new viruses that can infect other CD4+ T-lymphocytes or in latent state which may become activated later. In transcriptionally active stage, the infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes die due to cytopathic effect of the virus. As a result, the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which are able to recognize foreign and infected cells, declines, and this decrement lead stoper manent and lasting damage to the immune system [3] . The immune system finally loses its ability to fight and kill infections due to the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes count which is so small. When an individual reaches this stage, the person is said to have AIDS [4] . The time between getting infected with HIV and advancing to AIDS is, in general, five years but changes due to many factors. If the CD4+ T-lymphocytes cells count falls below 200 cells/mm 3 , then the person is considered to be in the \"AIDS phase\", otherwise the person is said to be HIV infected [5] .
