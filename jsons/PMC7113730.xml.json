            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are the key components of innate immunity in response to viral infection. Among the three type IFNs (types I, II, and III), type III IFN-lambda (IFN-L) was recently discovered as a member of the IL-10 superfamily of cytokines (Dellgren et al., 2009, Kotenko et al., 2003, Lazear et al., 2015; review; Mordstein et al., 2010). Similar to type I IFN, IFN-L is a multigene family of closely related cytokines, consisting of four members in humans (IFN-L1, IFN-L2, IFN-L3, and IFN-L4) and two in mice (IFN-L2 and -L3) (Dellgren et al., 2009, Lazear et al., 2015; review). So far, only two members of porcine IFN-Ls (IFN-L1 and IFN-L3) have been cloned and expressed (Sang et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2011). Recently, IFN-L was shown to predominantly act in mucosal organs, including epithelial surfaces of the liver, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, which are major entry points for many pathogens (Lazear et al., 2015; review; Mordstein et al., 2010, Pott et al., 2011). Similar to type I IFNs, IFN-L is rapidly produced after infection and, following engagement with its receptor, induces IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to mediate antiviral activity (Hernandez et al., 2015, Kotenko et al., 2003). Although type I IFN and IFN-L induce similar proximal signaling events and downstream transcriptional responses, the IFN-L receptor is structurally and genetically distinct from the type I IFN (alpha) receptor (IFNAR) (Kotenko et al., 2003, Lazear et al., 2015; review; Sommereyns et al., 2008). The IFN-L receptor is a single heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IFNLR1 signaling chain and the IL-10R\u03b2 accessory chain (Kotenko et al., 2003, Sommereyns et al., 2008). IFNLR1 is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells unlike IFNAR and IL-10R\u03b2, each of which is expressed broadly on many types of cells and tissues (Sommereyns et al., 2008). Given that IFNLR1 is predominantly expressed on mucosal epithelia, IFN-L may provide a more focused antiviral response at mucosal barrier sites to reduce the side effects associated with a systemic pro-inflammatory immune response, such as that of type I IFN. Therefore, IFN-L may be a potential antiviral therapeutic for targeting mucosal infections.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteropathogenic alpha coronavirus and causes swine disease with huge economic relevance (Madson et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014, Zhang and Yoo, 2016; review). PEDV primarily infects small intestinal epithelial cells in vivo, and infection causes pronounced villous atrophy that results in an acute malabsorption syndrome with symptoms of watery diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia in pigs of all ages (Li et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014). PEDV infection causes high morbidity and mortality, particularly in newborn piglets, which results in a significant economic loss in the pig industry (Jung et al., 2015, Li et al., 2012). Although there are several commercial PEDV vaccines available in China, the PEDV endemic has persisted in China since 2011 (Chen et al., 2012, Li et al., 2012). Therefore, the development of anti-PEDV therapeutics is urgently needed. IFN-L has been shown to inhibit replication of many viruses in vitro and in vivo (Baldridge et al., 2015, Hernandez et al., 2015, Sommereyns et al., 2008). However, there are no reports regarding whether porcine IFN-L inhibits the coronavirus PEDV.",

A previous study has demonstrated that Vero E6 cells can respond to recombinant human IFN-L1 and induce antiviral responses following human IFN-L1 stimulation (Stoltz and Klingstrom, 2010). First, we evaluated the antiviral activity of rpIFN-L1 against infection with the PEDV classical strain CV777 in Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with increasing doses of rpIFN-L1 for 24 h prior to infection with PEDV strain CV777. rpIFN-L1 treatment potently inhibited PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. By measuring PEDV viral RNA, it was found that rpIFN-L1 at concentrations of 1000 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml significantly inhibited PEDV infection. Compared with the control (1.77 \u00d7 108 copies), 1000 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml rpIFN-L1 reduced the level of PEDV viral RNA to 1.72 \u00d7 107 and 3.57 \u00d7 107 copies, respectively, resulting in more than 90% and 80% inhibition of PEDV infection, respectively. Additionally, 10 ng/ml rpIFN-L1 resulted in a 57.76% inhibition of infection in Vero E6 (Fig. 1\nA). The dose-dependent inhibition of PEDV by rpIFN-L1 was further confirmed by measuring PEDV-infected cells using IFA detection of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 2\nA). Next, we determined the stages of infection at which inhibition by rpIFN-L1 occurred by measuring virus production in the culture supernatant at different hours post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 1B). Pre-treatment with rpIFN-L1 at a concentration of 100 ng/ml reduced viral replication in Vero E6 cells at 12, 24, and 36 hpi (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that rpIFN-L1 exhibits antiviral activity against PEDV strain CV777 in Vero E6 cells independently of the responses induced by type I IFNs.",

As observed in Vero E6 cells, pre-treatment with rpIFN-L1 reduced PEDV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A).

As with rpIFN-L1, treatment with rpIFN-L3 significantly inhibited PEDV infection in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The inhibition of PEDV infection by rpIFN-L3 was further assessed by IFA (Fig. 2B). Compared with rpIFN-L1, rpIFN-L3 exhibited a reduced (2-fold) viral inhibitory effect in Vero E6 cells when treated with lower doses of rpIFN-Ls (18.73 \u00b1 10.16% for rpIFN-L1 versus 45.06 \u00b1 7.24% for rpIFN-L3 at 100 ng/ml; 42.24 \u00b1 15.01% for rpIFN-L1 versus 77.84 \u00b1 11.31% for rpIFN-L3 at 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, unlike the infection of Vero E6 cells, rpIFN-L3 exhibited a more potent activity against PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells at lower doses than that of rpIFN-L1 (Fig. 1A).

The classical strain CV777 is of the G1 genotype and is a Vero E6-adapted strain. Strain LNCT2, a wild isolate obtained by our laboratory, is of the G2 genotype and replicates less efficiently in both Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells in vitro compared with the cell-adapted CV777 strain (Wang et al., 2016). To determine whether rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 are capable of inhibiting infection with strain LNCT2, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with LNCT2 after pre-treatment with rpIFN-L1 or rpIFN-L3. Both rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 significantly suppressed infection of IPEC-J2 cells with strain LNCT2 in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by measuring viral RNA in the cellular supernatant (Fig. 3\n). Although rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 exhibited a similar level of viral inhibition at 1000 ng/ml, rpIFN-L3 more efficiently inhibited LNCT2 infection in IPEC-J2 when using concentrations of 100 ng/ml to 1 ng/ml than rpIFN-L1. These results demonstrate that rpIFN-L inhibits infection of PEDV G2 genotype in porcine intestinal epithelial cells.",

We next sought to determine whether an ISG antiviral response in IPEC-J2 was induced following rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 stimulation. The relative quantities of mRNA of 3 representative ISGs (i.e., ISG15, OASL, MxA) relative to their expression in control cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Transcriptional expression was up-regulated by approximately 171-fold for ISG15, 232-fold for MxA, and more than 2000-fold for OASL when cells were treated with 1000 ng/ml rpIFN-L1 (Fig. 5\n). The expression of the three antiviral genes exhibited a dose-dependent response to rpIFN-L1 stimulation in IPEC-J2 cells and was correlated with the antiviral activity against PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. Similar to rpIFN-L1, both rpIFN-L3 and IFN-\u03b1 up-regulated the expression of all three antiviral genes after 24 h stimulation of IPEC-J2 cells. Interestingly, rpIFN-L3 elicited significantly lower OASL than rpIFN-L1 (P < 0.05), even though rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 induced similar levels of MxA, and rpIFN-L3 induced significantly higher levels of ISG15 at 100 ng/ml than rpIFN-L1 (Fig. 5B and C). Consistent with a greater antiviral efficacy in IPEC-J2 cells by rpIFN-L1 compared with IFN-\u03b1, rpIFN-L1 induced greater mRNA expression of antiviral genes ISG15, OASL, and MxA than IFN-\u03b1, especially when using a high dose of 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 5). These data suggest that IPEC-J2 cells preferentially respond to rpIFN-L, although both IFN-\u03b1 and rpIFN-L have antiviral activity in these cells.",

IFITMs primarily restrict the early life cycle of enveloped viruses and inhibit viral entry by blocking viral fusion. As expected, the expression of porcine IFITM1 and IFITM3 were induced in a dose-dependent manner in IPEC-J2 cells following stimulation with either rpIFN-L or IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 5D and E). Unexpectedly, unlike the expression profiling of ISG15, OASL, and MxA, IFN-\u03b1 up-regulated similar levels of IFITM1 and IFITM3 expression to those of rpIFN-L1. By contrast, rpIFN-L3 induced the highest levels of IFITM3 expression among the three IFNs at both 1000 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml. These results indicate that both IFITM1 and IFITM3 are induced by IFNs but exhibit various sensitivity to the stimulation of different IFNs and that rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 induce a different profile of antiviral genes even though they use the same receptor. We further cloned porcine IFITM1 and IFITM3 into a pCAGGS-HA vector. The transient expression of IFITM1 and IFITM3 was verified by western blotting (data not shown). The transient over-expression of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in Vero E6 cells inhibited PEDV infection, especially for IFITM3, which resulted in a 40% decrease of PEDV infection (Fig. 6\n). All these results indicate that rpIFN-L induces the expression of multiple host antiviral genes to inhibit viral infection.",

Here we report that both rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 have robust antiviral activity against PEDV infection in both IPEC-J2 and Vero E6 cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-L plays a vital role in restricting enteric viral infections relative to type I IFN (Mordstein et al., 2010, Pott et al., 2011, Sommereyns et al., 2008). Our results of the comparison of rpIFN-L1 and IFN-\u03b1 against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells also demonstrate that rpIFN-L more efficiently inhibits PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells than IFN-\u03b1, although both inhibit PEDV infection. Consistent with these results, rpIFN-L1 induced higher levels of antiviral gene expression (ISG15, OASL, and MxA) in IPEC-J2 cells compared with IFN-\u03b1, indicating that the ISGs induced by IFN-L confer an antiviral state in IPEC-J2. Timothy J. Nice et al. demonstrated that IFN-L alone can prevent and cure the enteric persistent infection of murine norovirus (MNoV) without the help of adaptive immunity (Nice et al., 2015). The study of another virus targeting intestinal epithelia, rotavirus, confirms that IFN-L but not type I IFN inhibits rotavirus infection in vivo (Pott et al., 2011). All these imply that IFN-L preferably provides the critical antiviral defenses of the intestinal epithelium compared with type I IFN.",

Two members of porcine IFN-L have been reported so far (Sang et al., 2010). Although porcine IFN-L1 and IFN-L3 both belong to the type III interferon family, porcine IFN-L1 (GenBank accession no. ACZ63406.1) and IFN-L3 (GenBank accession no. NP_001159962.1) have only 52.4% amino acid identity. Among the four members of human IFN-L, IFN-L1 and IFN-L3 are studied most and show some differences in their antiviral activities (Dellgren et al., 2009, Lazear et al., 2015; review). Previous studies have shown that human IFN-L3 has the highest antiviral activity in an in vitro model of encephalomyocarditis viral infection (Palma-Ocampo et al., 2015). This finding is consistent with our results comparing the anti-PEDV activity of rpIFN-L1 and L3, as we found that rpIFN-L3 exhibited more anti-PEDV activity at lower concentrations (from 100 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml) than rpIFN-L1 in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 3). In addition, rpIFN-L3 exhibited approximately 30-fold more anti-VSV activity in the bovine kidney MDBK cell line than rpIFN-L1 (data not shown). However, the higher anti-PEDV activity of rpIFN-L3 in IPEC-J2, compared to rpIFN-L1 is not observed in the Vero E6 infection model of PEDV. The difference in antiviral activity between Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells may be attributed to a difference in protein affinity of rpIFN-L1 or rpIFN-L3 to IFNLR1, given that both recombinant proteins only have a 52.4% amino acid identity. Our results indicate the importance of the specific cell type used when evaluating the antiviral activity of IFN. Therefore, pIFN-L3 exhibits a more potent, or at least similar, antiviral activity than pIFN-L1.",

Consistent with this result, all three IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, rpIFN-L1, and rpIFN-L3) provoked the expression of the antiviral genes ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITM1, 3 in IPEC-J2 cells. However, the magnitude of these antiviral responses triggered by IFN-\u03b1 and rpIFN-L were dissimilar, as 1000 ng/ml IFN-\u03b1 stimulation resulted in an approximately 2-fold reduced expression of ISG15 and MxA compared with rpIFN-L 1 and rpIFN-L3, but IFN-\u03b1 more efficiently up-regulated IFITM1 expression than rpIFN-L1 (Fig. 5). Although the different expression of IFNAR and IFNLR1 in epithelial cells accounts for the variation of the profiles of the induced antiviral genes, distinct signaling events of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-L might contribute to the different levels of antiviral genes observed in this study. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-L specifically activates JAK2, although both IFN-L and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 lead to the activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (Odendall et al., 2014, Odendall and Kagan, 2015; review). In addition, interestingly, the transcriptional profiles of antiviral genes elicited by rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 are not the same, even though rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 engage the same receptor (Fig. 5). Further studies are needed to identify the different transcriptional profiles of antiviral genes by different IFNs, which is vital to clarify the various antiviral effects of different IFN-L members.",
