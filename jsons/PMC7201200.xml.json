In many respects, Cohen and his contemporaries\n(Cohen and Young,\n1973; Hall et al.,\n1978; Pearson,\n1983) were the first to articulate the essential role of news-making in\nconstructing social problems. Beyond generating surplus visibility and making\notherwise marginal behaviours appear pernicious and pervasive, the media represent\nan independent voice (Goode and\nBen-Yehuda, 2010). By delineating moral boundaries and circulating dire\npredictions about monstrous others, the histrionic tenor of reporting sensitizes\naudiences, culminating in hardened sentiment and unbridled punitiveness (Wright, 2015). Moreover,\ncoverage translates \u2018stereotypes into actuality\u2019, elevating the actual and perceived\nseverity of deviance (Young,\n1971: 11). Here, identifying affronts to moral order triggers virulent\nhostility, further marginalizing folk devils and amplifying their deviant\nattachments and identities. As a control culture is institutionalized, surveillance\nand intervention intensify, exposing additional deviance, confirming popular\nstereotypes and justifying further crackdowns (Garland, 2008).",

A particularly influential critique in these regards comes from McRobbie and Thornton\n(1995). For them (1995: 560), Cohen\u2019s emphasis on mass-broadcasting and its social and\ninstitutional correlates \u2013 a univocal press, hierarchical information flows,\nmonolithic audiences \u2013 is untenable in the context of \u2018multi-mediated social\nworlds\u2019.1\nSpecifically, it is held that the proliferation of media sources encourages exposure\nto alternative, if not dissenting, claims and reactions, ensuring that \u2018hard and\nfast boundaries between \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018deviant\u2019 are less common\u2019 (McRobbie and Thornton,\n1995; 572\u20133; cf. Tiffen,\n2019). Moreover, expanded access to media technologies \u2013 portable\ncamcorders, personal computers, editing software and so one \u2013 broadens the remit of\nexpression, giving rise to media sources inflected with the interests of\nmarginalized groups (Coleman and\nRoss, 2010). Able to \u2018produce their own media\u2019 and defended by \u2018niche and\nmicro-media\u2019 (McRobbie and\nThornton, 1995: 568), folk devils are no longer powerless victims and can\n\u2018fight back\u2019 (McRobbie,\n1994; cf. deYoung,\n2013; Thornton,\n1995). Consequently, deviant outsiders and their supporters display\ngreater capacity to contest and short-circuit panicked reactions, outcomes that\nrender the success of moral crusades \u2018much less certain\u2019 (McRobbie and Thornton, 1995: 573).",

With the onset of the 21st century, digital platforms not only\nunderpin but also constitute social life in affluent societies, with individuals\u2019\nidentities and relations at least partly cultivated through computing\ninfrastructures (Lupton,\n2018). Among the most significant manifestations of \u2018digital societies\u2019\nare social media. Whether as social networking (Facebook), micro-blogging (Twitter),\nor photo \u2013 (Instagram) and video-sharing (YouTube) sites, social media have\nprofoundly reconfigured the production and exchange of information. As\n\u2018many-to-many\u2019 systems of communication, they promote vernacular discourse and\ncreativity, permitting ordinary users to produce and distribute staggering\nquantities of \u2018user-generated content\u2019 (Keane, 2013; Yar, 2014).2 Digital platforms are also\ndisplacing the mass media as an information source.3 Finally, as loosely coupled\nnetworks of users, their structure not only promotes virality \u2013 the rapid and\nunpredictable diffusion of content \u2013 but also fosters an expansive virtual sociality\n(Baym, 2015; boyd, 2010).

With\ninformation control representing a critical axis of power, social media are\nfrequently depicted as an elite-challenging \u2018microphone for the masses\u2019 (Murthy, 2011; cf.

Here, the\naccessibility and sophistication of digital platforms is believed to empower\nordinary citizens to make their own news, name issues as public concerns, and shape\ncollective sentiment (Coleman\nand Ross, 2010; Turner, 2010). With knowledge production and image-making increasingly\nsteered by non-experts, many perceive citizen journalism as breeding accounts of\nreality rooted in public-mindedness rather than sensationalism or commercial\nconsiderations (Goode,\n2009). In light of such developments, noted panic scholars claim digital\nmedia are shifting \u2018the locus of definitional power\u2019, ensuring \u2018more voices are\nheard\u2019 (Critcher, 2017)\nand generating \u2018new possibilities for resistance\u2019 (Lindgren, 2013: 1243). Thus, the\nincreasingly nodal configuration of media space has attenuated moral guardians\u2019\ninfluence, ensuring that panics are \u2018more likely to be blunted and scattered among\ncompeting narratives\u2019 (Goode and\nBen-Yehuda, 2010: 99; cf. le Grand, 2016).",

Whether employed to advance claims that Harry\nPotter promotes Satanism and the occult to impressionable youth (Sternheimer, 2014) or\ndiscredit public officials and assert a link between vaccinations and autism\n(Erbschloe,\n2018), digital environments offer optimal arenas for uniting the\nconspiratorial.

Following its emergence in Wuhan, China in January 2020, widespread\nscapegoating and fear-mongering erupted across social media. In relation to\nthe former, the virus was racialized, with numerous messages linking it to\nthe ostensibly exotic dietary practices and unsanitary behaviour of Chinese\npopulations, with representations depicting them as folk devils and\ndangerous, impure others (Yang, 2020).9 Reflecting a\n\u2018politics of substitution\u2019 (Jenkins, 1992), such claims-making\ndiverted attention from considerably more deadly (and preventable) diseases\n(e.g. malaria), as well as, the structural conditions \u2013 media censorship,\npolitical corruption, weakly enforced health and safety standards \u2013\nunderlying the emergence and rapid spread of the disease. Digital platforms\nwere also used to circulate misinformation and dire, if not apocalyptic,\npredictions with various rumours \u2013 whether false reports of positive cases\nand contaminated Chinese imports, stories of individuals absconding from\nquarantine zones, or claims that the virus was a bioweapon developed by the\nChinese or American governments \u2013 outpacing official information during the\nearly stages of the outbreak (Bogle, 2020). By contributing to a\nbroader climate of suspicion, such communications appear to be reactivating\nfears of a \u2018yellow peril\u2019, as well as producing emergency measures (enhanced\nsurveillance, quarantines, travel bans etc.) and everyday expressions of\nracism and anti-Chinese sentiment (Dingwall, 2020; Palmer, 2020; Yang, 2020). As\nthis example reveals, like prior epidemics (SARS, AIDS, etc.) where media\ncoverage promoted fear and opprobrium about various outsiders (gay men, drug\nusers, foreigners; see Muzzatti, 2005; Ungar, 2013; Watney, 1997), digital\ncommunications also play a significant role in distorting understanding and\nencouraging over-reaction. The episode equally suggests, however, that\nsocial media\u2019s anonymous, horizontal structure ensures that messages travel\nexponentially faster, lack clear origins and feature palpable vitriol,\noutcomes that escalate the impetus and excess of alarm (Miller, 2020).",

On the one hand, advances in artificial\nintelligence allow bots \u2013 machine-led communications tools that mimic human\nusers and perform simple, structurally repetitive, tasks \u2013 to spread\n\u2018computational propaganda\u2019 (Bradshaw and Howard, 2017; Ferrara et al.,\n2016). As social machines and artificial voices, bots automate\nand accelerate diffusion and engagement, creating, liking, sharing, and\nfollowing content at rates vastly surpassing human capabilities. Thus, they\nfacilitate viral engineering; expanding the momentum of certain messages\nand, in the process, altering information flows. To exude authority and\nauthenticity, content is also circulated by bogus, \u2018sockpuppet\u2019 accounts\nposing as those of accredited experts (scientists, journalists, etc.) or\nordinary citizens belonging to various groups (women, blue-collar workers,\npolice officers, urban youth, etc.) and appearing to possess folk wisdom\n(Bastos and Mercea,\n2017; Marwick\nand Lewis, 2017). Whether manual or automated, techniques of\nmedia manipulation also control narratives by reducing the visibility of\nunwanted and objectionable content. Here, keywords and hashtags affiliated\nwith opposing perspectives can be \u2018hijacked\u2019 as platforms are flooded with\nnonsense or negative messages to disrupt and drown out specific\ncommunications, denuding them of their salience and influence (Woolley and Howard,\n2016).",

First, as many-to-many\nsystems of communication, social media promote novel patterns of participation,\noffering ordinary persons a greater role, facilitating spontaneous outbursts driven\nby multitudes and introducing automated, machine-led campaigns. Additionally, in\nenabling new techniques of media manipulation, digital platforms contribute to the\nweaponization of panics. While conventional wisdom suggests that panics represent\ndomestic affairs, oriented towards mobilizing support, acquiring power and status or\nmanufacturing consent, the case of Russia and information warfare suggests that\nnormative conflict may be exogenously engineered to provoke significant social and\npsychological disruption. Finally, in place of uniform messages and mass appeal, the\ncombination of data-mining and behavioural profiling unleashes claims-making\ntechniques that are inhabited and hyper-targeted.",
