Their basic information, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT) scans as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed. We found that, as a common underlying disease in COVID-19 patients, diabetes is associated with worse prognosis. We extracted demographic data, medical history, exposure history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, and the treatment measures from electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom showed up. Clinical outcomes were followed up to 3 March 2020.

These data showed that the COVID-19 patients with comorbidity is at higher risk of tissue injury-related enzymes release, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state, which may signifying a poorer prognosis of COVID-19. These results prove that comorbidities do have an impact on the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.Since our purpose is to explore whether diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, we next excluded patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of other comorbidities on the results.
