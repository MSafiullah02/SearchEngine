SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules. Further, molecular docking analysis unveiled that NTASWFTAL possessed a greater affinity towards HLA and also available in a greater range of the population. Our study provides a consolidated base for vaccine design and we hope that this computational analysis will pave the way for designing novel vaccine candidates.",

Later it was confirmed that these pneumonia cases were due to a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously named as 2019-nCoV) and the disease condition of this virus is referred to as COVID-19 (1) (2) (3) . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

COVID-19 virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family of the Genus Betacoronavirus, pleomorphic or spherical particles, 150 to 160 nm in size, associated with positive single-strand RNA (ssRNA) which is surrounded by crown-shaped, club-like spikes projection on the outer surface. Among all RNA viruses, Coronaviruses have the largest genome typically ranging from 27 to 32 kb. After the two previously reported coronavirus-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, this is the third coronavirus that has already infected humans and the preliminary investigations revealed that some environmental specimens of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan were positive for COVID-19 (3) . Although the seafood market was reckoned positive for COVID-19, no specific association with an animal is confirmed yet based on the WHO report.

A mature SARS-CoV-2 virus generally has a polyprotein (the open reading frame 1a and 1b, Orf1ab), four structural proteins such as envelope (E) protein; membrane (M) protein; nucleocapsid (N) protein; spike (S) protein and five accessory proteins (Orf3a, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf8, Orf10), and particularly, SARS-CoV-2 encodes an additional glycoprotein having acetyl esterase and hemagglutination (HE) attributes, which identified it distinct than its two predecessors (10). The functions of accessory proteins may include signal inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest (11). The S protein on the surface of the viral particle enables the infection of host cells by binding to the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), utilizing the S-protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD).",

An epitope-based peptide vaccine has been raised in this aspect. The core mechanism of the peptide vaccine is based on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that can induce specific immune responses and are immune-dominant. T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids) while the B-cell epitopes can be proteins (12,13).",

Viral proteins are processed into short peptides inside the infected cells and then loaded onto major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) proteins. After that, the MHC-peptide complexes are presented on the infected cell surface for recognition by specific T cells. Activated CD8 + T cells then recognize the infected cells and clear them. T-cell immunity also depends strictly on the MHC-peptide complexes which are similar to the antigen-antibody association. MHC proteins are encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) which is located among the most genetically variable regions on the human genome. Each HLA allele can only present a certain set of peptides that can be presented on the infected cell surface and recognized by T cells are called T-cell epitopes. For a vaccine, it is essential to identify Tcell epitopes that originate from conserved regions of the virus T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (14).",

Both humoral immunity and cellular immunity provided by B-cell antibodies and T-cells respectively are essential for effective vaccines (15, 16) . Although humans may mount an antibody response against viruses normally, only neutralizing antibodies can block the entry of viruses into human cells completely (17) . Antibody binding site's location on a viral protein strongly affects the body's ability to produce neutralizing antibodies (18) . It is important to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 has potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) near their interacting surface with its known human entry receptor, ACE2. Besides neutralizing antibodies, human bodies also depend on cytotoxic CD8 + T-cells and helper CD4 + T-cells to clear viruses completely from the body. For anti-viral T-cell responses, presentation of viral peptides by human MHC class I and class II is essential (19) . MHC-I analysis includes common alleles for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Multiple investigations have indicated that antibodies generated against the N protein of SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection (20) .",

The reason for focusing particularly on the epitopes in the N structural proteins is due to their dominant and long-lasting immune response which was reported against SARS-CoV previously. For the identified T-cell epitopes, we incorporated the information on the associated MHC alleles so that we can provide a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally. Therefore, we designed an epitope-based peptide vaccine to potentially narrow down the search for potent targets against SARS-CoV-2 using the computational approach with an expectation that the wet laboratory research will validate our result.",

For example, both lopinavir and ritonavir are HIV protease inhibitors but in a lopinavir-ritonavir clinical trial report, the treatment benefit derived was dubious (50). From recovering patients, several convalescent immunoglobulins are derived which is currently investigated as a potential treatment for the disease (51). As there have been no approved treatments for COVID-19 that exists until now, these treatments are the best hope for striving to keep the mortality rate low before vaccines become widely available. Earlier, it has been thought that vaccine development primarily relies on B-cell immunity, but recent discovery unveiled that T-cell epitopes are more propitious as a result of more long-lasting immune response mediated by CD8 + T-cells and due to the antigenic drift, by which an antibody is not able to respond against an antibody (62) . In this study, focusing on MHC class I potential peptide epitopes, we predicted T-cell as well as B-cell epitopes which were able to show immune responses in various ways. Many characteristics including antigenicity, toxicity need to take into consideration for identifying a protein sequence-based epitope into a vaccine candidate and the predicted eight epitopes were fulfilled the entire criterion. However, only five potent epitopes have been predicted from the NetCTL 1.2 server and the epitopes were further taken for the progressive analysis. Besides, all peptides except SSPDDQIGY were able to interact with the MHC class I alleles, and NTASWFTAL interacted with the most MHC class I alleles. Amongst them, HLA-A*68:02 possessed the highest probable score. Further, the conservancy of the epitopes which was predicted by the IEDB conservancy analysis tool delineated that all of our predicted epitopes had the maximum identity of 100%. Therefore, we have taken the epitope NTASWFTAL for further analysis due to its maximum interaction with MHC class I alleles and the highest conservancy.",

With the divulgement of sequence-based technology in genomics and proteomics, enough pieces of information are available regarding different eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms including viruses. Therefore, utilizing various bioinformatics tools, it is possible to design peptide-based vaccines through comprehensibly studying the epitopes and several studies suggested epitope-based vaccines against different diseases including dengue, chikungunya, Saint Louis encephalitis virus (53-55). Although epitope-dependent vaccine design is quite familiar, a little research works are done in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is different from the DNA virus as well as the rate of mutation is higher than the DNA viruses and according to various research, it can be assumed that the mutations might occur in the N protein (56). Recently, N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are regarded as a primary target for vaccine development as its function includes viral replication and directly associated with the infection process (57), as a consequence related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Previous research works have already established that N proteins of several viruses as well as SARS are considered as a potential target for the development of vaccines (58-61). Moreover, we have already mentioned the detrimental role of SARS-CoV-2 in host-cell responses. This aspect leads us to conduct in silico experiments for designing a peptide-based vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2.",
