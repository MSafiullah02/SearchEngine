The same spirit that inspired the construction of the hospital with pavilions, today is evidence of the efficacy precisely as it enables a more effective response to the pandemic. The only limit is the increase in access points, which are present in all In addition, all the recommendations reported by SAGES 2 and the American College of Surgeons 3 regarding the use of electrocautery, ultrasonic scalpels and the risk of transmission by aerosol during laparoscopy were provided. In our experience, all cases were treated via exploratory laparotomy. In COVID-19 confirmed patients, it is important to consider the time that elapses between the disposition for urgent surgical intervention and the preparation of the OT and the protection of all OT staff. In addition, the use of complete PPE makes the surgery non-confortable due to perspiration or fogging of the goggles and the implementation of the recommendations that reduce energy devices to a minimum make the intervention technically challenging.",

Obviously it would be preferable to perform the surgery knowing that the swab is negative in order to serenely perform surgery using all the surgical energy devices, the laparoscopic approach and not wearing complete and uncomfortable PPE. Of course, this entails some specific issues, especially regarding surgical indications and the decision-making process. For less significant surgical pathologies, such as appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis (excluding the forms associated with general peritonitis) and potential surgical intervention that can be deferred by a few hours (waiting for the swab) it must be considered that the time that elapses between the execution of the swab and the response of the swab must not change the treatment strategy. In fact, in order keep stress factors mitigated within the team, many surgeons may be tempted to abandon the surgical strategy in favour of conservative treatments. The risk of undertaking a conservative treatment, with the consequent discharge of the patient and re-admission after a few days for the same pathology for a worsening of symptoms (and subsequent new swab at entry), is high and must be taken into consideration. In our opinion, the surgical response should be the same as before the COVID-19 era.",

In this regard, the possibility of carrying out a remote digital examination, via a dedicated platform which records all activities, has been envisaged; -the execution of the oropharyngeal (OP) swab 48 hours before the elective hospitalization for patients with neoplastic pathologies who need scheduled surgery, or for patients who need to perform invasive procedures; -limitation of access for carers and visitors, except for procedures involving minors where the presence of at least one parent is required; -the body temperature measurement with body-temperature scanners, providing a surgical mask for those without it and the disinfection of hands with hydroalcoholic gel for anyone entering the hospital, including employees; -the postponement of all internal and open training events within the hospital; -the suspension of meetings that require the presence of multiple professionals, replacing them with video conferences or rescheduling them after the pandemic; -banning the presence in the hospital of volunteers or trainees for educational / training purposes; -the communication of news regarding the state of health of patients to designated family members performed by telephone, daily, or in case of changes in the clinical status (need for surgery, outcome of surgery, postoperative course, etc.).",

            "text": "individual pavilions and not the presence of one single access point. In this regard, in each pavilion there is a check point where an operator measures body temperature, provides the masks and invites the disinfection of hands with an hydroalcoholic gel. Our pavilion, the DEA (Emergency and Reception Department) pavilion, which includes the activities related to the emergency and urgency as a whole, has been remodelled in order to allow an adequate response to the pandemic in progress such as enhancing the number of beds in the intensive care unit, the increasing of subintensive care units and the remodulation of the DEA into differentiated COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 wards. At the beginning of the introduction of social distancing measures and the beginning of lockdown, we noticed a reduction in the inflow of surgical patients in urgency, which lasted approximately 15 days. Subsequently, there was a gradual resumption of surgical activity in urgency until reaching the previous standard activity. Conversely, the emergency surgical activity related to traumatic pathology has undergone to a sharp reduction due to the lockdown measures imposed by the government with the limitation of people's movement. Our hospital follows standardized procedures in order to homogenize behaviors, precisely in the management of emergencies. In the event of surgery, COVID-19 confirmed patients are transferred from a dedicated area of the Emergency Department (ED) to a dedicated COVID-19 Operating Theater (OT) by a specific transfer pathway. The entire OT team is equipped with full Personal Protection Equipment (PPE); numerically surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists are limited to the minimum required staff to perform surgery. Moreover, changes of personnel are limited until the end of the procedure in order to involve the least number of operators. A filter area is provided at the entrance to the COVID-19 Operating Theater where all the necessary PPE are available. All the clinical and essential patient's documentation is consulted and updated outside the OT after removing the PPE and performing the disinfection of hands. The doors of the OT are kept closed during operation and any supply of material to the OT is carried out by personnel with PPE, present outside the dedicated OT.",
