BPD infants have higher incidence of sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, mortality, readmission after discharge, and long-term neurodevelopmental delays [3]. BPD incidence is inversely correlated with gestational age at delivery and is the highest among infants born <1000 g (extremely low birthweight (ELBW)) [3]. Since the incidence of BPD is significantly higher among ELBW infants, transfer to tertiary centers for definitive care is required where, in some studies, the rate of BPD approaches 100% [4]. While advances have significantly improved ELBW survival, BPD rates have not improved [5].",

We initiated three primary interventions via several plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Because the interventions focused on developing protocols, all PDSAs involved having progressively larger numbers of individuals from multiple disciplines test the practicality of the protocols and provide feedback. Our protocol development targeted three major pathophysiological contributors to BPD. First, to reduce pulmonary barotrauma, we developed an RT-driven protocol to speed extubation of infants in the NICU (Supplementary Fig. 2). Second, to reduce oxygen toxicity, we revised our oxygen saturation guidelines and emphasized the goal of being on 21% oxygen by DOL 28 (\u201c0.21 by 28\u201d campaign). The target saturations for all infants under 32 weeks PMA, which had previously varied by provider, was standardized at 90\u201395%. Third, to reduce oxygen need, scarring, and inflammation from atelectasis, we developed a noninvasive respiratory support protocol encouraging the use of CPAP through 36-weeks PMA unless the infant could come off CPAP without requiring more than minimal oxygen beyond 32 weeks PMA (Supplementary Fig. 3). The intention of these efforts were to minimize practice variations in respiratory modalities offered to the babies. The three protocols were introduced simultaneously in April 2014.",

We suspected that this was multifactorial: (1) incomplete buy-in from some staff into the guidelines, (2) ineffectiveness of education as the main intervention, (3) continual staff turnover, and (4) inability to keep focus on BPD prevention with multiple other QI initiatives taking place. For example, internal data collected through 2017 showed poor compliance with saturation alarm limit settings, with many set inappropriately at 100%. Therefore, in late 2017 we launched a \u201creinvigoration\u201d of the project and added more interventions based on the two primary drivers. We appointed a lead RT person during the days whose primary focus was to monitor compliance to protocols and saturation limits that were set on the monitor. In efforts to objectively and consistently manage supplemental oxygen in real time, we initiated the practice of utilization of SpO2 histograms.",

The key drivers in our QI project were derived from the known physiologic mechanisms leading to BPD [21]. Our interventions included those that have shown evidence of reducing the incidence of BPD [20, 22]. The combination of guideline development/rollout was only partially and temporarily effective, until consistent project champions could provide timely, non-punitive actionable feedback to the front line staff to improve adherence (\u201cCure Me\u201d rounds).

In this high-risk population of preterm infants, we were able to extubate babies sooner and use more non-invasive positive pressure support, which correlated with a decrease in our rates of any BPD and severe BPD over the same period. These results are consistent with our previous data from our extremely low gestational age patients, which demonstrated that the earlier an extubation attempt was made, the lower the rate of BPD or severe BPD, even if re-intubation was required [29].
