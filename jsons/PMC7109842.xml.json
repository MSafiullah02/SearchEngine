In the United States and elsewhere, surveillance for diverse infectious (and noninfectious) diseases has typically relied on an essentially passive system of reporting by health-care providers or laboratories, often mandated by public health laws. Although such passive systems of disease reporting have proven invaluable, their limitations, such as incomplete, often inconsistent detection of cases and delayed detection of outbreaks, are well documented (35). As a result, active surveillance systems that do not depend on providers and laboratories to report have been developed and promoted.",

That only approximately 250 viruses are known to infect humans (and an even smaller handful to cause major epidemics) may constrain the value of large-scale virus discovery for identifying high-risk pathogens, as well as viral determinants of pathogenic potential (41). Spillover events causing recent epidemics\u2014including H1N1 in Mexico, Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia, and EBOV in West Africa\u2014have been poorly predicted by factors long believed to drive disease emergence (42). Accordingly, interest in expanding our catalogue of potential pathogens should be weighed against our persisting need to enhance the detection and control of outbreaks of known pathogens (43). For instance, 2 EBOV epidemics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018 took weeks to be identified, with dozens of suspected cases having already accumulated (44, 45).",

The prevalence of antibodies indicating previous exposure may provide valuable information about the frequency of animal-human spillover events and the potential for person-to-person spread, overcoming reporting biases that favor detection of large outbreaks under traditional surveillance. Moreover, the low cost of multiplex assays makes integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens plausible. Although serosurveys have bolstered recent efforts to understand the geographic range and clinical spectrum of EBOV and Zika virus infections (47, 48), the enhancement of dengue hemorrhagic fever risk by prior exposure (49), and the role of immunologic history in influenza susceptibility and vaccine response (50), there remain few examples of public health programs undertaking serological studies for routine surveillance, at least in civilian populations (51).",

Initiatives such as the ProMED-mail network and HealthMap (52, 53) compile and disseminate news about outbreaks from media and other sources, aiming to trigger investigation by public health organizations. Data such as emergency department visits, medication sales, online search queries, and social media postings have also been suggested as real-time indicators of outbreak activity, although their integration into public health responses remains a subject of debate (54\u201356). The need to overcome reporting biases is a central challenge, because observations may be too nonspecific to distinguish between meaningful and spurious signals in settings with high technological capacity while also being insensitive to even high-risk events in resource-poor settings (57, 58). Although nontraditional data sources have, in some applications, supported inferences about epidemic dynamics (59), limited information about cases from such sources remains a barrier. For instance, models fitted from news reports of recent measles and mumps outbreaks have yielded considerable underestimates of vaccine coverage (60\u201362), underscoring the importance of field investigations.",

Because members of a vaccinated cluster are exposed to direct protection through vaccination and indirect protection due to reduced transmission within their clusters (28), cluster-randomized trials have weaker statistical power than individually randomized trials of the same size (111). Moreover, the direct effect measured in individually randomized studies may be a preferred, transportable efficacy measure (112). Uses of simulation helped in planning vaccine trials tailored to the real-world circumstances of the EBOV outbreak (113) and enabled trialists to compare alternative designs in terms of ethical mandates (114). Simulation-guided design further presents the opportunity for applying adaptive trial methods (115) in the context of infectious disease outbreaks, where dynamic trends in incidence may highlight the benefits of such approaches.",

Most commonly applied in evaluations of influenza vaccines, test-negative designs have become popular in routine (116) and exploratory (117) studies of vaccine effectiveness. By measuring vaccine effectiveness from the exposure odds ratio of vaccination among individuals seeking care who test positive or negative for a pathogen of interest, this design seeks to overcome associations of health-care seeking with vaccination status (118). However, it is uncertain whether health-care seeking and other sources of confounding are appropriately controlled for, and whether measures accurately capture vaccine direct effects (119, 120). Uncertainty about the validity of estimates that routinely inform vaccine policy-making demonstrates the need for formal evaluations of such studies and strategies to reduce bias.",

Although the ecological nature of such designs permits the introduction of biases from changes in diagnostic practices or health-care seeking, such studies nonetheless have offered important insights where other approaches failed. Limited reductions in influenza-related deaths among elderly persons amid increases in influenza vaccine coverage during the 1990s provided an important indication that the \u201chealthy vaccinee\u201d effect accounted for astonishing and implausible protection against all-cause mortality among elderly influenza vaccine recipients in cohort and case-control studies (121\u2013123). Newer methods continue to improve public health inferences obtained from time-series data. In a recent evaluation of invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, trends expected under continued use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine provided a counterfactual condition for measuring the impact of the switch to a 13-valent vaccine targeting emerging serotypes (124). Bayesian averaging of models encoding differing pre- and postvaccination trends and change points provides a generalized strategy for defining such counterfactual comparisons (125). Other signals of transmission intensity in surveillance data, such as age of infection and sub- or multiannual periodicity, may provide additional insights while reducing sensitivity to fluctuations in reporting effort (126, 127).",

Situational factors may undermine researchers\u2019 ability to establish the extent to which cases owe to primary or secondary vaccine failure in all or certain vaccine recipients, and whether emerging pathogen lineages are escaping vaccine-driven immune pressure. For instance, high compliance with vaccine schedules may limit variation in individuals\u2019 vaccination status and exposures, necessitating large samples to detect factors influencing vaccine performance (128). Because re-emergence most likely reflects the expansion of 1 or several pathogen clades, limited pathogen diversity may hinder the application of conventional approaches to identifying microbial determinants of vaccine escape (129, 130). Novel methods to distinguish null from vaccine-driven mutations in antigen-coding regions (102, 131) may streamline efforts to identify vaccine escape, while mathematical modeling provides a basis for comparing candidate hypotheses with observations (26, 27).",

The tradeoff between maximizing a drug\u2019s impact and minimizing resistance selection has led policymakers to ration certain new drugs as last-resort treatments. However, in recent experience, such decisions have ignited ethical debates (152). Coupling mathematical modeling with field-based studies has proven useful for understanding the effectiveness of antimicrobial use policies, as highlighted in recent evaluations of the risk of resistance under population-wide access of the tuberculosis drug bedaquiline (153, 154) and antimicrobial cycling to limit resistance selection in hospital settings (155, 156).",

The problem of ascribing a clinical syndrome to an etiologic agent is among the oldest in epidemiology, dating at least to the 19th century, when Robert Koch laid out criteria for such inference (i.e., Koch\u2019s, or more correctly, Henle-Koch\u2019s, postulates (158)). However, these postulates have long been recognized as inadequate, particularly for illnesses caused by viruses, and thus of largely historical interest (159); for instance, the notion that a pathogen should be absent from healthy individuals is incompatible with the prominence of carriage and asymptomatic infection in the natural history of numerous pathogens. A growing appreciation of the complexity of the human microbiome, and the likelihood that intricate mixtures of microorganisms at diverse body sites may be either the cause or consequence of both detrimental and beneficial physiological states, has further highlighted the difficulty of linking a given health outcome to infection by a single microorganism.",

The best causal understanding of such relationships has come from randomized trials demonstrating that infection-preventing interventions are efficacious against downstream chronic illness, such as peptic ulcers due to Helicobacter pylori and chronic wheeze due to respiratory syncytial virus (161, 162). Natural experiments following the same intuition have provided additional evidence of such relationships, such as measles-induced immunosuppression (163), malnutrition and stunting due to enteric infection (164), and complex or chronic otitis media due to tissue damage from acute early-life disease (165). Such relationships have proven difficult to probe in the absence of a randomized or natural experiment, because of the likelihood that confounding factors influence individuals\u2019 risk for initial infection as well as chronic sequelae. New paradigms for ascribing an etiologic role to microorganisms and resulting host responses are clearly needed and may prove important in efforts to quantify the health impacts of infectious disease interventions.",

At the same time, advances in epidemiologic and statistical methods, together with the growing availability of data from diverse sources, have provided new tools and approaches for studying infectious diseases. The infectious disease epidemiologists of the future will need a solid grounding in the biology of infection and the host immune response, as well as training in the increasingly sophisticated approaches to causal inference; the manipulation and analysis of large-scale data sets, including pathogen genome sequences; and mathematical modeling, together with the behavioral and social determinants of health. Integration of these elements into epidemiology training programs (e.g., through coursework in Bayesian statistics and phylogenetics) represents an increasingly important consideration for academic departments.",
