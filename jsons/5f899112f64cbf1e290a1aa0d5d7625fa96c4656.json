Inappropriately high levels of antibiotics are still prescribed in primary health care for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Access to diagnostic point-of-care tests (POCTs) for RTIs might reduce this over-prescription. Objective. The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic performance and clinical feasibility of a recently developed diagnostic POCT for respiratory viruses, the mariPOC \u00ae , in a Dutch primary healthcare setting. Methods. In patients with RTI symptoms presenting to a family practice during the 2015-2016 winter season, we determined the test's sensitivity and specificity relative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing performed in a laboratory. The clinical feasibility of the POCT was evaluated by interviewing general practitioners (GPs). Results. One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 54.9% of the patients (n = 204). For influenza A virus (n = 24), sensitivity of the POCT was 54.2% and specificity was 98.9%; for influenza B virus (n = 18), sensitivity was 72.2% and specificity 99.5%; and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 12), sensitivity was 50.0% and specificity 100%. In samples with higher viral load, sensitivity was 85.7% for influenza A, 78.6% for influenza B and 85.7% for RSV. The availability of a diagnostic test for respiratory viruses was appreciated by both patients and GPs. Conclusions. Our study shows that diagnostic POCTs for respiratory viruses might contribute to a precise and evidence-based diagnosis of RTIs and could positively influence prescription of antibiotics by GPs.

Three main factors might have influenced the lower viral load in most of our samples and thus the lower sensitivity. Firstly, our study population consisted mainly of adults, while other studies of this POCT were mainly conducted in children. Children often have higher viral loads which can explain better results in antigen detection tests (20) . Secondly, while the previous studies were done in patients who were hospitalized or presented at an outpatient department, here we evaluated the POCT in primary care where patients tend to have less severe illness than those in hospital.

A first explorative interview amongst the GPs revealed positive feedback on the usefulness of the POCT, but a more appropriate qualitative survey needs to increase insight in the potential additional value of POCTs in primary health care.
