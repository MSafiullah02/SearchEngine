            "text": "Obesity is increasingly prevalent after solid organ transplantation, and may negatively impact the transplant population on multiple levels [1\u20136]. Obesity in transplantation patients may also negatively impact perioperative and long-term outcomes after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) [7\u201311]. In the systematic review by Sood et al., obesity was associated with a higher odds ratio for biopsy-proven acute rejection, mortality, allograft loss, and the development of diabetes [8]. Patients with a history of solid organ transplantation are routinely considered to be high-risk patients. This risk stratification is compounded by the presence and disease burden of obesity. Given its safety profile and health impact, there is increasing interest in the role of MBS in obese patients with prior organ transplantation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare outcomes of the largest North American patient cohort, with and without a history of solid organ transplantation, undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery.",

The MBSAQIP is responsible for the accreditation of bariatric surgical facilities. Requirements for certification include reporting bariatric surgical outcomes to the MBSAQIP Participant Use Data File (PUF), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data file registry containing prospectively entered, risk-adjusted, clinically rich data using standardized definitions for preoperative, intraoperative, and post-operative variables that are specific to metabolic and bariatric surgical care. Data points are abstracted at participating institutions by certified reviewers who are audited for accuracy of performance. For the first time, the 2017 file included data on previous solid organ transplantation, including a history of heart, lung, liver, renal, pancreas, and bowel transplantation. The database does not give the ability to discern which type of transplant has been performed. This is a de-identified, nationally available, clinical database; therefore, neither institutional review board (IRB) approval nor patient consent was required for our study.",

The literature regarding the safety of MBS in patients with organ transplantation continues to evolve. Current literature demonstrates that MBS is overall safe in transplant patients, but is limited to single-center experiences with small sample sizes [1, 2, 12].",

However, there is an increased rate of overall morbidity and bariatric-related morbidity compared with the general bariatric population. For both propensity and case-control matched analyses, operative duration, post-operative length of stay, and progressive renal failure remained significantly longer and higher in transplant patients. Some outcome differences were noted between our propensity and case-control matched cohorts. While a higher morbidity was noted in the transplant cohort after propensity matched analysis, it did not persist after case-control matched analysis. This was similarly noted for readmission, unplanned ICU admission, aggregate renal complications, and surgical site infection. Across analyses, leak rate remained higher in the transplant cohort. In comparison with propensity matching, case-control matching is often associated with smaller cohorts that are more tightly matched. This was the case in our analyses, and may have accounted for some of the outcome differences noted between our cohort matching techniques.",

In our unmatched analysis, transplant patients were more likely to be on chronic steroids and have preoperative renal insufficiency. Previous matched analyses of the 2015\u20132016 MBSAQIP database have demonstrated that chronic kidney disease (CKD) and corticosteroid to be independent predictors of morbidity following MBS [15, 16]. Patients with CKD were more likely to have increased total morbidity, infectious complications, and hospital length of stay [15]. Interestingly, corticosteroid use was an increased risk factor for anastomotic leak (two- to three-fold) but without an increased risk for overall morbidity [16]. The increased leak rate conferred by steroids is prevalent in other surgical disciplines and throughout the literature. Although we control for both of these variables in our propensity and case-control matching techniques, these factors may still contribute to the increase leak rate and morbidity in the TXP cohort.

Khoarki et al. reported their experience with 10 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy after liver, kidney, or heart transplant. Mortality and morbidity were 0% and 20%, respectively. In addition to significant weight loss and resolution of obesity-related conditions, they reported increased graft preservation in liver transplants, improved ejection fraction in heart transplants, and increased estimated glomerular filtration rate in renal transplants [1]. In a case-control matched analysis, Cohen et al. found that post-transplantation bariatric surgery was protective for allograft failure (HR 0.85) and mortality (HR 0.80) [14]. In another single-center small case series, Elli et al. compared outcomes between 10 post-transplant (kidney, liver, or pancreas) and 490 non-transplant LSG patients. Allograft function at 1 year was excellent with 100% follow-up in the transplant cohort, and there was no reported mortality or morbidity [12]. Transplant specific analyses show that bariatric surgery was also safe after renal [17] and liver transplantation [13], with low morbidity and mortality. Our study corroborates these findings with no difference in mortality; however we found that prior solid organ transplantation increases the risk of 30-day morbidity and anastomotic leak in MBS patients.",

While the largest reported study on this topic, the overall transplant cohort was small and outcomes are limited to 30 days post-operatively.

We were unable to stratify our transplant cohort by the type of solid organ transplantation performed as this variable is not available in the database. Also unavailable was information on non-solid organ transplant patients; therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to all transplant patients. Due to the small sample sizes, we were unable to stratify our analyses by bariatric procedure type (sleeve vs. gastric bypass) and surgical approach (robotic-assisted vs. conventional laparoscopic). These are potential confounders that may have impacted our findings. To limit procedure-type and surgical approach as potential confounders, these variables were equally matched in both our propensity and case-control matched analyses. Additionally, we lack the timeframe between organ transplantation and metabolic and bariatric surgery, which may impact intraoperative findings, operative course, and ultimately outcome. Finally, information regarding specific immunosuppression regimens for the transplant cohort was not available, and may have also biases biased our findings.",
