            "text": "Feline panleukopenia (FPL) is a contagious disease of cats caused by feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), a member of the feline parvovirus subgroup within the Parvovirus genus (family Parvoviridae) together with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) and parvoviruses of wild carnivores. While FPLV has been known since 1920, CPV emerged as dog pathogen in the late 1970s most likely as host variant of the feline virus (Truyen, 2006). FPLV has maintained a certain genetic stability (Decaro et al., 2008c), whereas CPV-2 has displayed higher rates of nucleotide changes (Shackelton et al., 2005, Pereira et al., 2007, Hoelzer et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2009). Few years after its onset, the original CPV-2 was replaced by two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and 2b, differing in 5\u20136 amino acids in the main capsid protein VP2 (Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1991). A third variant CPV-2c was detected in 2000 in Italy (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) and found to spread quickly in all continents (Martella et al., 2004, Nakamura et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005a, Decaro et al., 2006b, Decaro et al., 2006c, Decaro et al., 2007b, Perez et al., 2007, Hong et al., 2007, Calderon et al., 2009, Nandi et al., 2010).",

There are several reports on the detection of CPV-2a/2b in cats affected by FPL (Mochizuki et al., 1993, Truyen et al., 1996, Ikeda et al., 2000) but only one report on infection by CPV-2c (Battilani et al., 2006). Also, a unique mutation (Gly-300 to Asp), related to the loss of the canine host range in vitro (Parker and Parrish, 1997), has been identified in some feline CPV-2a/2b isolates (Ikeda et al., 2000), suggesting that CPV-2 variants may have started a process of adaptation to the new feline host.",

A 3-month-old Persian kitten (case no. 1, 11/08), was hospitalized with haemorrhagic diarrhoea, fever (39.8 \u00b0C), depression, anorexia, oral ulcers, gingivitis and progressive loss of weight. The animal had already completed the vaccination protocol against FPLV, feline herpesvirus (FeHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), Chlamydophila felis and rabies. Despite the administration of fluids and antibiotics, the kitten died eight days after the onset of the disease. Blood cell counts obtained from an EDTA\u2013blood sample collected three days before the death showed a slight modification of white blood cell (WBC) counts, with marked lymphopenia and neutrophil counts within normal ranges (data not shown). At necropsy, the carcass was cachectic with ulcers in the oral and pharyngeal mucosae, haemorrhagic enteritis, areas of necrosis in the liver, enlargement of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes that were scattered with haemorrhages. Material from the oral ulcers and the intestinal content were collected at necropsy for virological investigations. Few days before, clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis had appeared in a 1.5-month-old Italian Mastiff dog (12/08-A, born and raised in Italy) and in a 3-month-old German Spitz dog (12/08-B, imported from Romania), that had received one and two doses, respectively, of a tetravalent vaccine against parvovirosis, canine distemper, adenovirosis and leptospirosis. The imported pup had also been vaccinated against rabies. Haematological investigations carried out at day 4 after the onset of clinical signs showed moderate lymphopenia in both pups, with WBC and neutrophil counts being within normal values (data not shown). Both pups were given fluids and antibiotics with a full recover within 8\u201310 days. Rectal swabs were collected from the two pups at day 4 after the appearance of symptoms.",

The viruses were characterised genetically by mapping single nucleotides polymorphisms in real-time PCR with MGB probes and by sequence analysis of the VP2 protein gene. The severity of the clinical signs and the outcome of the disease varied between the two cats, as the infection was fatal only for the CPV-2a infected cat. The source of infection was tracked for the CPV-2a-infected cat, and it was likely represented by one of the two infected pups housed in the same pet shop. Whether the pup imported from Romania was the index case could be only suspected but not clearly demonstrated, considering that the disease appeared simultaneously in both domestic and imported pups. CPV-2a is epidemiologically predominant in dog populations of Eastern Europe, whereas in Italy CPV-2c appears to be more common (Martella et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2007b). Importation to Italy of pups from Eastern European countries has been suggested to be the source for emerging or re-emerging pathogens including canine adenovirus type 1 (Decaro et al., 2007a) and the arctic lineage of CDV (Martella et al., 2006). According to this scenario, it is tempting to hypothesize that the type 2a strain detected in the cat 11/08 and dogs 12/08-A and 12/08-B was introduced in the pet shop with animals imported from Romania.",

            "text": "As a consequence of the detection of CPV-2 variants in the feline host, a debate has now arisen on the efficacy of FPLV-based vaccines against infections by CPV variants 2a, 2b and 2c. In a recent study (Gamoh et al., 2005), an FPLV-based vaccine was able to cross-protect against a challenge with a virulent CPV-2b strain. However, in that study only two vaccinated cats were used and the animals were challenged shortly after the administration of the second vaccine dose. A similar protocol has been employed to demonstrate protection by type 2-based vaccines against the CPV-2 variants in dogs (Spibey et al., 2008, Larson and Schultz, 2008) although this approach does not mimic adequately what happens under field conditions (Decaro et al., 2008a). There are no studies evaluating long-term protection induced by the original type 2 against its variants, when type 2 specific antibody titres could not be adequate to prevent infection and disease caused by field strains. Indeed, the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the original type of CPV-2 appear to recognize the antigenic variants 2a, 2, and 2c less effectively than the original type 2, thus suggesting that even a few amino acid changes in strategic epitopes of the capsid are able to affect markedly virus recognition by protective antibodies (Pratelli et al., 2001, Cavalli et al., 2008). Using cross-neutralisation studies, the antigenic differences between FPLV vaccines and CPV-2 variants appear to be much more marked, reflecting the number of mutations scattered throughout the VP2 protein (Parrish et al., 1991, Nakamura et al., 2001a).",
