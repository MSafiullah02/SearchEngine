A great variety of polyanionic compounds have been described which act as virus adsorption inhibitors. This class of compounds also comprises the cosalane analogues, containing the polycarboxylate pharmacophore, as well as the sulfated polysaccharides extracted from sea algae (Nakashima et al., 1987a, Nakashima et al., 1992, Santhosh et al., 2001, Witvrouw and De Clercq, 1997). All of these compounds are assumed to exert their anti-HIV activity by shielding the positively charged sites in the V3 loop region of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein, and interrupting virus attachment to the negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surface, and inhibiting the specific binding to the CD4 receptor of CD4+ cells. Some of these compounds can also interfere with later events in receptor-mediated fusion by virtue of attachment to gp120. These compounds probably do not penetrate into cells because of their mass and highly anionic charge, but rather, act as antiviral agents by impeding the attachment and subsequent entry of virus particles into the cell.",

The extent of inhibition appeared to be dependent on both the viral strain and host cell type. Dextran sulfate interferes with the association of gp120 with CXCR4 while having no detectable effect on gp120-CD4. The interaction between polyanions and X4 or X4R5 gp120 was readily detectable, whereas weak or undetectable binding was observed with R5 gp120 (Moulard et al., 2000). Cosalanes inhibited the binding of gp120 to CD4 as well as the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and is more potent against R5 HIV-1 RF in CEM-SS cells than against vs X4 HIV-1 IIIB in MT-4 cells (Santhosh et al., 2001).",

Extracted constituents of this medicinal plant, such as tryptanthrin, has been shown to possess anti-fungal, cancer chemopreventive and anti-bacterial activities (Honda and Tabata, 1979, Koya-Miyata et al., 2001, Kataoka et al., 2001, Miyake et al., 2003), while pigment (PtP) has an anti-anaphylactic activity (Kim et al., 1998). In this study, we report for the first time the potent anti-HIV-1 and HSV-1 activity of an aqueous extract from the fermented leaves of Polygonum tinctorium (Sukumo). This extract was found to be highly selective against HIV-1 and HSV-1 in vitro. Sukumo extract suppresses production of HIV-1 by inhibiting the viral entry process through binding to the virus envelope and thus preventing HIV-induced syncytium formation with an exceedingly broad therapeutic window. Based on the results of physico-chemical analysis of the anti-viral active factor, it is putatively a novel polyanionic high-molecular-weight compound containing a phenolic sub-structure in aqueous extract of Sukumo.",

These can be divided into the entry steps and post-entry steps. In this study, we have demonstrated by several different techniques that Sukumo extract inhibits the HIV-1 infectious process at the cell entry step. The data presented in Fig. 3 indicate that Sukumo extract is able to block viral binding to target cells and inhibits virus-induced cell\u2013cell fusion. Furthermore, a time-course experiment showed that the full protective activity of Sukumo extract was achieved when the compound was present during the 2-h virus adsorption period, but none of the effect was seen when the compound was incubated with the cells prior to viral infection. Also, the extract did not suppress the viral replication after the virus had entered the cells. Thus, Sukumo extract interferes with an early event of the virus replication cycle, most presumably the viral adsorption step.",

In addition, this activity of Sukumo extract was lost if the cells were washed prior to addition of antibody, indicating that the compounds can only weakly associate with the cell surface.

This results in prevention of virus attachment to the cell surface receptor or co-receptor, whereby interference with early adsorption and entry into the HIV replicative cycle. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Sukumo extract interferes with virions rather than cell function.

It was also confirmed that the anti-HIV compound(s) consist of phenolic substructure by FeCl3\u2013K3Fe(CN)6 staining (Barton et al., 1952) (data not shown) and a polysaccharide containing sulfur atom by sugar analysis and elemental analysis, respectively (Table 1). The factor was estimated to be a high molecular weight compound of 10,000\u201350,000 by Sephadex G-75 gel-filtration analysis (data not shown) and an SDS-gel of Sukumo extract (Fig. 6B). No protein was detected in the water extract of Sukumo with SDS-PAGE/silver staining. The data confirm our observation that the inhibitory activity of Sukumo extract was not inactivated by protease digestion or heating at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min. Furthermore, boiling of the Sukumo extract in the presence of 1N HCl, 6N H2SO4 and 1N NaOH for 6 h did not result in any loss of this activity. Similarly, it was not inactivated by NaIO4 treatment (Nakashima et al., 1987b), which breaks down carbohydrates (Table 2). This suggests that the sugar backbone is not essential for the anti-HIV activity of the Sukumo extract. The pharmaceutical value of the Sukumo extract is likely to be further enhanced by its stability over a wide range of pH values, as shown by the heating at 121 \u00b0C 20 min and treatment with acid and alkaline conditions. Since the anti-HIV-1 activity of Sukumo was higher than that of fresh leaves (data not shown), the possibility that the active substances were derived from bacteria could not be excluded.",
