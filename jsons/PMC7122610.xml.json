Collaboration between, especially, developed and developing countries, to ensure the availability of technical and other resources is a crucial factor in building and strengthening public health capacity, networks, and systems that strengthen global public health security. Such collaboration could prevent the rapid spread of disease. It is estimated that 2.1 billion airline passengers traveled in 2006; a disease outbreak or epidemic in any part of the world is only a few hours away from becoming an imminent threat somewhere else [2]. Developing countries, which collectively shelter over three quarters of the world\u2019s population, face severe public health crises from both widespread infectious diseases, such as HIV epidemics, rampant TB, malaria, and viral hepatitis as well as staggering chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors. Approximately 15 million people die each year due to infectious diseases\u2014predominately in developing countries [3]. The rapid progress of science and technology in the twentieth century uncovered many new forms of medicine, which greatly improved people\u2019s health in developed countries. However, patent protection for medical drugs and patent monopoly, as stipulated by the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), guarantee monopolizing profits. Essentially, this guarantee causes the price of patent drugs to skyrocket, which severely hinders the accessibility of drugs that are essential to public health in developing countries.",

As major exporters of these products, developed countries advocate the protection of intellectual property while developing countries worry that intellectual property rights only support the monopoly led by international companies and raise the price of the drugs and total medical costs, ultimately having a negative impact on public health emergency response capability. In 1995, the TRIPS agreement was implemented in Uruguay Round to join the protection of intellectual property rights and the cross-retaliation system of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Developing countries agreed to protect intellectual property in exchange for market access and trade preferences from developed countries. In particular, the U.S. used its economic hegemony, along with the trade preference \u201cCarrot\u201d and the big-stick policy of \u201cSuper 301 sanctions of penalty article\u201d to force other countries to accept the TRIPS agreement [4], causing conflict over the protection of intellectual property and the right to obtain essential medicines.",

The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (simply referred to as the \u201cDoha Declaration\u201d) was adopted in November of [5]. It states that the \u201cTRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members\u2019 rights to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\u201d [6]. Therefore, the Doha Declaration reaffirms the right of WTO member states to grant compulsory licenses in a state of national emergency. Compulsory licensing refers to a government\u2019s consent to someone other than the patent owner to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner. Specifically in the medical field, the term denotes the government allowing a third party to produce patented drugs. However, TRIPS mandates that the drugs produced under a compulsory license must be used only in the domestic market, which creates a major obstacle for the countries with no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector to import unregistered generic drugs [6].",

The first revision of the series waived the obligations of exporting members: generic drugs produced under compulsory licenses can be exported to other developing countries lacking the manufacturing capacity instead of remaining exclusive to the domestic market within the manufacturing country. This additional stipulation to the law removed obstacles hindering developing countries\u2019 ability to make full use of compulsory licenses. The second revision waived the remuneration to patent holders from importing countries because the exporting country already pays it. This General Council decision resolved the previous issues of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration.

Developing countries should make full use of the privileges introduced by this document by granting compulsory licenses in public health related areas or use it as a tool to acquire a voluntary license in the local manufacture of drugs or in negotiation for affordable drug price. These areas should target drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and tumors, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, as well as malignant tumors, to break the high price barrier of imported patent drugs and make them accessible to the respective country\u2019s population.

In response to the severe epidemic, South Africa passed the South Africa Medicines and Related Substances Act in December 1997, authorizing the government to issue a compulsory license and parallel importation. In February 1998, a South African pharmaceutical group united 40 companies who, together, filed a lawsuit on the claim that the South Africa Medicines and Related Substances Act of 1997 is unconstitutional because it gives the Minister of Public Health the power to ignore the Patent Act. Ultimately, these companies faced an ethical dilemma of protecting patents over saving human lives and finally withdrew the lawsuit and substantially reduced the price of the drugs.

Their annual production capacity is 7,690 tons, with 60\u201370% exported and with India as the largest purchaser, followed by western pharmaceutical companies. In response to the low demand of the Chinese for antiviral drugs, the four companies recently developed limited manufacturing capabilities of four to five off-patent ARV drugs. The annual production capacity of these four companies is 96 billion pills. Due to the small domestic market, the sale capacity was less than 1% of production capacity [38]. China has about 5,000 pharmaceutical companies and about 10% are on a similar scale to the above four companies. Many of them also have dual operations with majority API exported and medical drugs mainly sold in the domestic market. Chinese companies have developed many generic drugs including the popular three-ARV drug combination pill. Due to the patent issues, China\u2019s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) does not accept generic drug applications for these drugs under patent protection. The small domestic market and the patent obstacles of the international market have severely restricted the ability of the Chinese pharmaceutical companies to satisfy the huge demands for essential medicines both at home and in other developing countries.",

Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi once said, \u201cMedical inventions are not patented, and we cannot make profits between life and death.\u201d The patent law issued in 1970 declared that food, medicine, agricultural chemicals cannot be patented; only the method of making these products can be patented. Therefore, one can make the same exact product or drug by a different methodology according to the Indian Patent Law. This regulation was vital to the rise of the Indian domestic pharmaceutical industry. For many years, the Indian government has withstood pressure from western countries and maintained efficient laws for generic production on the grounds of promoting health and equity. After its entrance into the WTO in 1995, India was pressured by western countries to enter the TRIPS agreement but was granted a period of 10 years to adapt their patent laws to the international standards. India issued the 2004 Patent (amendment) Bill on December 26, 2004. This law mandates that India must begin accepting medicine, agricultural chemicals, and food patent applications from January 1, 2005. However, the Indian government stated that they would only recognize applications submitted from January 1, 1995 onwards and also declared that certain drugs, methods, or applications cannot be patented. At the same time, the Indian Patent Office maintains a unique flexibility in its approval process for generic drugs [44]. For example, if the US FDA has approved a drug, a generic version can be approved for use without first going through a clinical trial in India.",

This significant cost savings contributed to PEPFAR\u2019s ability to dramatically improve access to antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. In 2008, there were eight PEPFAR programs that procured at least 90% of ARV packs in generic form. Additionally, deliveries in Ethiopia, Haiti, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe were more than 99% generic. The officer in PEPFAR strongly supported the use of generic drugs because saving money ultimately means saving more lives [45]. One of the biggest hurdles in the rapid scale-up of ARV therapy in developing countries is the high cost of the ARV drugs. However, developed countries in the west and large international pharmaceutical companies are strongly against the compulsory licenses. They often justify their standpoint that they believe it is against patent law to produce generic drugs and that such ability will have a negative impact on the research and development of new drugs. The use of patented drugs is acceptable in developing countries. However, given the current epidemics and public health crises in developing countries, patented drugs are simply inadequate. Generic medications provide an affordable means to provide treatment to more people suffering from HIV/AIDS. In order to solve the demand of patent drugs in developing countries, and to save more lives around the world, the best long-term solution can be provided by compulsory licensing.",

The international community has reached a consensus about the conflict between the monopolies protected by patents and public health and has chosen to protect public health and expand the accessibility of drugs.

However, when there is a public health threat, developed countries will issue compulsory licenses without hesitation to solve the crisis.
