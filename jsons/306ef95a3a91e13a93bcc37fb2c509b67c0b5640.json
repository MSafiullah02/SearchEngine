It requires specialized rooms, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), monitored donning and doffing, logistically-complicated patient transportation from the community to the healthcare facility and back (typically through emergency medical services), and appropriate decontamination of transport and hospital environments. Additionally, evaluating a patient for emerging pathogens in a healthcare setting runs the risk of exposing patients and staff to infection. In a clinically stable patient with mild symptoms, alternative methods for special pathogen evaluation/testing are vital to preserve healthcare resources and prevent unnecessary exposures. Patients with symptoms of illness and possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 are identified either by Public Health or through a call to any part of the University of Washington healthcare system, with calls routed to the IPC team responsible for HAT activities. If the patient meets Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for testing, 3 Public Health determines appropriateness of a HAT visit and SARS-CoV-2 testing in the field.",

Given concerns with healthcare exposures and healthcare-associated outbreaks with SARS-CoV-2, as well as historical experiences with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV transmission in healthcare settings, minimizing the exposure risk to clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals is crucial. 5, 6 As healthcare workers are known to be at risk of contamination during doffing of PPE, even when caring for patients with routine respiratory infections, 7 the importance of well monitored appropriate PPE doffing for special pathogens cannot be over-emphasized. Given the novel nature of this pathogen, that the exact mechanisms of transmission have yet to be defined and unclear morbidity and mortality, this is an important yet often overlooked step in keeping our healthcare workers safe.",

Several challenges, including lack of clarity around route of transmission to healthcare workers while doffing PPE, prohibited the program from being implemented at that time. However, when the number of people being monitored by Public Health for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) including contacts of the first U.S. case 1 and recent travelers from China who developed symptoms increased in King County, Washington, the Harborview Home Assessment Team (HAT) was revised and launched in partnership with Public Health to provide real-time clinical assessments of patients in need of evaluation for COVID-19 who do not require emergency medical care or hospitalization. Methods Nurses and physicians at Harborview Medical Center, an urban county teaching hospital in Seattle, WA, have been engaged in continuous training in the care of patients with special pathogens since 2014 with biannual refresher courses. In January 2020, we received support from our hospital and Public Health to launch the HAT program, using trained personnel and our Infection Prevention & Control Program (IPC).",

Specimens are obtained (nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and sputum if appropriate) for SARS-CoV-2 testing to be performed by the CDC or Washington State Department of Health laboratory. An additional nasopharyngeal swab is collected for viral respiratory pathogen testing, including influenza, at the University of Washington Virology Laboratory. All equipment used for assessment (e.g. disposable stethoscopes and thermometers) are left with the patient. Documents requiring signatures (consent, HIPAA, etc.) are signed and photographed by the patient on their own phone and emailed to a secure University of Washington email address for uploading into the medical record.After collection, nasopharyngeal swabs are placed in collection vials with universal viral transport media and into a biohazard bag with an absorbable pad. Each biohazard bag is cleaned with bleach (0.55% sodium hypochlorite) wipes with a 3 minute dwell time. Upon exit from the evaluation site, the specimen bags are placed directly into a sealable, autoclavable, transport box handled by a clean trained observer. This transport box is subsequently transported back to the laboratory.Doffing procedures are performed one healthcare worker at a time, with assistance from the trained observer and monitoring by the site commander (Figure 1). Hand hygiene is performed with a 70% ethanol based sanitizer. Waste management is safely performed by the trained observer and overseen by the site commander in order to minimize contamination to the healthcare worker and leave waste that is not externally contaminated(Figure 2). Because of lack of licensing to transport Level B biohazard waste, all waste is left with the patient. Upon confirmation of negative results, the patient places waste into their usual waste removal process. For patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, a licensed company will be contacted for Level B biohazard waste removal.Patients are instructed to self-isolate pending results of tests and to continue isolation if positive for SARS-CoV-2. Public Health performs at least every other day phone follow-up (more frequent for medically fragile patients) until results are obtained and thereafter for those with COVID-19, until resolution of symptoms to ensure no progression of illness and no need for medical care.",
