            "text": "Knowledge of a pathogen\u2019s origin(s) and its rate of evolution provides a crucial framework for understanding its biology. However, for most viruses, this information can only be inferred indirectly, as viruses leave no fossils and so existing populations provide the only certain information of them. Many recent reports of statistical analyses of the gene sequences of viruses collected on different dates conclude that extant viruses have large mutation rates and must therefore have originated in the past few hundred or thousand years, but doubts about these interpretations (Firth et al. 2010; Sharp and Simmonds 2011; Duch\u00eane, Holmes, and Ho 2014), and clues of much more ancient origins of some viruses, are forcing a re-think. Much of the doubt has arisen from evidence of viruses or virogenes integrated in the genomes of plants (Bejarano et al. 1996; Geering et al. 2005; Chiba et al. 2011; James et al. 2011; Lefeuvre et al. 2011; Lyttle, Orlovich, and Guy 2011; Kondo et al. 2013; Filloux et al. 2015) and animals (Gifford et al. 2008; Katzourakis et al. 2009; Belyi, Levine, and Skalka 2010a, b; Gilbert and Feschotte 2010; Horie et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2010, 2011; Worobey et al. 2010; Han and Worobey 2012), where the taxonomy of the integrated genes and their \u2018hosts\u2019 indicates an ancient origin. Attempts to establish ancient origins by phylogenetic evidence of co-divergence of host and virus (e.g. Wu et al. 2008) have proven to be more controversial (De Vienne et al. 2013). In the tests reported here, we used new methods to re-examine the evidence for and against co-divergence for tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its relatives in the genus Tobamovirus.",

Holmes (1951) was perhaps the first to comment, albeit indirectly. He noted that the Nicotiana spp. and other solanaceous plants, that responded to infection by TMV in a hypersensitive manner, are all natives of Central and South America, whereas Nicotiana species that are most susceptible to systemic TMV infection are mostly found in North America, southern South America, and Australia. Holmes argued that these differences resulted from the selection of TMV-resistant plant populations in Central and South America, and hence that this region was probably the \u2018original habitat of tobacco-mosaic virus in prehistoric times\u2019.",

Their sequence relationships, represented as a Darwinian tree, were found to correlate with their serological relationships. If those viral proteins had evolved at much the same rate as similar proteins of cellular organisms (i.e. cf. 1% per million years), then the differences between them suggested that tobamoviruses had origins as ancient as their plant hosts, which first appeared as fossils more than 100 million years ago. This timing has since been supported by several lines of circumstantial evidence (Gibbs 1999; Gibbs et al. 2008, 2010, 2011), notably the possibility of co-divergence with their long-term eudicotyledonous hosts, because the relationships of the genomes of different tobamovirus species reflects the relationships of their hosts (Lartey, Voss, and Melcher 1996; Gibbs 1999), and as the relevant host clades diverged at least 100 million years ago (Magall\u00f3n and Castillo 2009; Magall\u00f3n, Hilu, and Quandt 2013), it suggests that the tobamoviruses did too.",

Pag\u00e1n et al. (2010) used dated samples to estimate that present-day tobamovirus replicase genes evolve at rates similar to those of most other viruses, and concluded that \u2018under these rates, a conservative estimate of the time of origin of the sampled tobamoviruses is within the last 100,000 years, and hence far more recently than proposed assuming co-divergence\u2019. In contrast, Stobbe et al. (2012) inferred the phylogeny of the genus Tobamovirus using the same algorithms and found that by \u2018calibrating the virus tree with dates of host divergence \u2026 resulted in predictions of divergence times of family specific tobamovirus clades that were consistent with the times of divergence of the host plant orders\u2019, which \u2018supports the idea that these viruses have co-diverged with their hosts since radiation from a common ancestor\u2019. Stobbe et al. had thus obtained statistical support from, in essence, proxy \u2018node dating\u2019 that their phylogeny resulted from an ancient co-divergence, however the internal branches of their phylogeny had poor statistical support.",

Wasabi mosaic virus sequences were so close to the youcai mosaic virus population, they were treated as such. The Accession Codes of the 185 sequences in the resulting alignment are given in Supplementary Data Table 1; a few tobamoviruses are represented by single sequences, and the 67 for TMV are the most for a single species. The genomic sequences were separated into their constituent ORFs (i.e. the separate genes for the replicase, movement, and CPs, including any overlapping regions of each gene). They were aligned using the encoded amino acids as guide by the TranslatorX server (Abascal, Zardoya, and Telford 2010; http://translatorx.co.uk) with its MAFFT option. The ORFs were analysed both separately, and in combinations, but mostly as the complete concatenated ORFs (concats) of each genome. The latter were tested for the presence of phylogenetic anomalies using the full suite of options in RDP4 (Martin and Rybicki 2000). Sites in the aligned protein sequences with more than five gaps were removed using POSORT, a DOS command line program available at http://192.55.98.146/_resources/e-texts/README-POSORT.pdf. Consensus protein sequences were derived for each of the species using the \u2018Create Consensus Sequence\u2019 function in BioEdit (Hall 1999). This function examines each site in the species alignments and determines whether any amino acid at that site is present at or above the selected frequency and, if one is, records that amino acid in the consensus. When more than one type of amino acid exceeds the selected frequency, then one of those possibilities is chosen at random and recorded in the consensus sequence, and if none exceeds the selected frequency then a gap is recorded.",

First the gene sequences were translated into the amino acid sequences they encoded to remove synonymous codon differences, which are mostly isolate specific. Next, sites in the sequences that included more than five sequences with an alignment gap were removed to minimize the influence of species-specific indels. Finally, consensus amino acid sequences were derived for each of the twenty-nine species using the \u2018Create Consensus Sequence\u2019 function in BioEdit (Hall 1999) over the range from 0 to 100 percent consensus. The relationships of the aligned degapped species concats were assessed using PhyML. Trees calculated from the consensus sequences, unlike those calculated from the nucleotide sequences, had a single unbroken statistically significant pathway through their basal regions. Furthermore, the log-likelihood support for individual trees correlated with the threshold level used to obtain the consensus sequences from which each was inferred; the greater the consensus level of the amino acid sequences, the greater the log likelihood support of the tree (Fig. 2).\n\n",

Nonetheless the distribution of primary hosts of the viruses in Fig. 3, as revealed by their names, is strikingly non-random. For instance, all ten of the viruses isolated from species of the Solanaceae fall into the same cluster (bottom right of Fig. 3), and the only non-solanaceous host of that cluster, Rehmannia, is from a related family of the Lamiales, as too are Plantago and Streptocarpus, which are the hosts of two viruses in the sister cluster (bottom left of Fig. 3). Similarly, all the viruses first isolated from cucurbits form a single cluster (top right of Fig. 3), and similarly the viruses isolated from brassicas, cacti, hibiscuses, legumes, and passifloras; each form their own small clusters in the phylogeny, even though the individual members of most pairs were isolated by different virologists from infected plants that were separated from one another and often found on different continents.",

Three CP genes however appeared to be from phylogenetically distinct tobamovirus taxa; Nigerian tobacco mosaic virus (NTMV; AY137775) was most closely related to, but distinct from TMGMV, tropical soda apple mosaic virus (AY956381) was likewise related to PMMtV, and a distinct CP gene (KF702319) of a CGMMV from luffa was a recombinant of two CGMMV lineages and therefore grouped with neither.

To simulate this possibility the tobamovirus phylogeny (Fig. 3) was modified by collapsing (shortening) its internal (basal) branches while maintaining their terminal (distal) regions and branching pattern. Two levels of shortening were tested (Fig. 4). First all basal branches were shortened to the level in the phylogeny where the Solanaceae-infecting and Brassica-infecting tobamoviruses diverged. This removed the differences of branch lengths in the basal half of the tree but, as a result, the original Mantel test correlation of 0.786 (P = 1e\u221206) decreased to 0.705 (P = 0.009). In a more stringent test, all lineages were shortened to the basal divergence of each host group (Fig. 4) and, as a result, the correlation decreased to 0.111 (P = 0.091). By comparison, when the host:virus linkages were completely randomized, the mean correlation of ten tests was 0.0015 (\u00b10.040) P = 0.474 (\u00b10.249). These tests indicate that the congruence between the topologies of host and virus phylogenies involves both the basal and distal regions of the virus tree, and that an ancient host switch is significantly more likely than a recent one.\n\n",

Therefore, the fact that most of the tobamoviruses form three groups of lineages that are congruent with the three groups of eudicotyledonous host plant lineages, asterids, rosids, and caryophyllids, clearly supports the co-divergence conclusion. Furthermore, using a modified Mantel permutation test to compare the phylogenies of nine plant and twenty-nine tobamovirus lineages we obtained strong statistically significant support for the congruence of the host and virus phylogenies, especially when the data for the brassica-infecting tobamoviruses was removed.",

The published conclusion that the tobamoviruses are no more than 100,000 years old (Pag\u00e1n et al. 2010) is probably incorrect, and is based on the assumption that estimates of evolutionary rates and dates calculated for individual virus species, using isolates collected over a few decades at most, can be extrapolated back into deeper evolutionary time. As virus populations are of finite size, selection or random events will constantly prune the population tree over time, and will ensure that current populations are not a fully representative sample of all the ancient populations. Wertheim and Worobey (2009) stated that coalesence methods give dating estimates that \u2018are seriously compromised by unaccounted-for biases\u2019, probably resulting from the combined effects of sequence change saturation and purifying selection (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2008; Ho et al. 2011; Duch\u00eane, Holmes, and Ho 2014). Furthermore, the evolutionary constraints within stable populations may differ considerably from those that occur during speciation, and/or \u2018emergence\u2019 (Gibbs, Nguyen, and Ohshima 2015). Wertheim et al. (2013) suggested that new substitution models must be devised and tested, and we suggest that corroborative studies based on more traditional evolutionary correlations, like those we report in this article, are also required.",

One dataset examined was all 185 tobamovirus sequences, and the other was the sixty-seven sequences from the species TMV, that are part of the 185 sequence dataset. For these comparisons, each sequence alignment was separated into two alignments, one consisting of all the codons that only differed synonymously (S changes; Fig. 5A and C), the other the codons that had differed non-synonymously (NS changes; Fig. 5B and D); 51 percent of the codons in the TMV sequences had only S differences and 33 percent were conserved unchanged, whereas in the 185 tobamovirus sequences 92 percent were NS codons and only 7 percent were S. NJ trees calculated from these alignments were then compared by pairwise plots of their patristic distances with NJ trees calculated from the amino acid sequences encoded by the complete sequences. These graphs show the relative rates of accumulation of nucleotide and amino acid changes from the branch tips (bottom left corner) to the base of the tree (top and right sides). Note that if S and NS changes were accumulating at the same rate as the amino acid changes (i.e. the \u2018nucleotide clocks\u2019 were synchronized with their \u2018amino acid clocks\u2019), then one would expect points in their patristic distance graphs to be clustered along linear diagonals, whereas changes in the relative rates would be indicated by deviation from those diagonals, and a trend asymptotic with the axes would indicate saturation.\n\n",

The differences for all sixty-seven TMV sequences (Fig. 5A and B) are, at most, 0.200 S and 0.293 NS nucleotide s/s and 0.067 amino acid s/s. The clustering of all points >0.25 amino acid s/s in the 185 tobamovirus sequence diagrams (Fig. 5C and D) is broadly parallel to the x-axis indicating that S changes mostly saturate by 0.15 nucleotide s/s. In contrast, NS changes (Fig. 5D) show no sign of saturation, and they trend along a diagonal with a separate final cluster comprised of all the distance comparisons linked through the basal branches of the trees. Note that as the S codons mostly vary only in the third nucleotide position, the sites that actually vary in the S codons saturate at around 0.6 nucleotide s/s. In summary then, changes in S codons dominate the nucleotide changes within species but become saturated probably before the amino acid changes exceed 0.3 s/s. As a result, any phylogenetic information they contain is obscured by saturation before they contribute information to the inferred phylogeny of the base of the tree. In contrast, the NS codons, and the changed amino acids they encode, accumulate more slowly than the S changes. They provide phylogenetic information even in the basal branches of the tree of the known tobamoviruses, and show no evidence of saturation.",

This is shown by the tobamoviruses of two plant lineages that are hosts of most (known) tobamovirus species, the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Over the long term, the tobamoviruses seem to have co-diverged widely within each of these plant taxa rather than tracking the evolution of individual plant species. In the Solanaceae, for example, the genera Anthocercis and Nicotiana are members of the sub-family Nicotianoideae, whereas Brugmansia, Capsicum, Nicotiana, and Solanum (Lycopersicon) are from the sister sub-family Solanoideae (S\u00e4rkinen et al. 2013). These groupings are not congruent with the relationships of the tobamoviruses from these species. Figure 3 shows that those isolated from Anthocercis and Nicotiana (TmGMV, TMV, and YTmMtV) are scattered among those with primary hosts from the Solanoideae. Similarly, the two most closely related cucurbit-infecting tobamoviruses are nested within a cluster in Fig. 3, but were isolated from species of Cucumis (KGMtMV) and Cucurbita (ZGMtMV), respectively, whereas the others were all from Cucumis species. Fuzziness of co-divergence is also shown by Rehmannia mosaic virus, which is clearly a solanaceous tobamovirus, yet was isolated from a species from the Lamiales, which are close relatives of the Solanales. Fuzzy co-evolution could also explain some anomalies in the topology of the base of the tobamovirus tree, as this part of the tree records events when the proto-tobamovirus population was probably infecting a single proto-eudicotyledonous population, for whereas the relationships of the asterid-infecting tobamoviruses and their asterid host families are congruent (Plumeria and FMV are sisters to the others), those of the rosid-infecting tobamoviruses and their hosts are not (legumes and cucurbits are the closest related of the rosid hosts). Nonetheless, the two tobamoviruses from cacti (i.e. caryophyllids) are linked in the basal region of the phylogeny to the asterid-infecting frangipani mosaic virus (host Plumeria: Gentianales), and this is congruent with recent molecular taxonomies of plants, which place the caryophyllids as a sister group of the asterids rather than the rosids (Magall\u00f3n and Castillo 2009; Jiao et al. 2012; Zimmer and Wen 2013).",

It is also likely that many of the present tobamovirus populations may have spread quite recently from species within their preferred primary host taxon to their current host species, indeed only two of the viruses in this study were isolated from wild plants in their natural environment; passion fruit mosaic virus from Passiflora incarnata in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve of Osage Co., OK, USA (Stobbe et al. 2012), and yellow tailflower mild mottle virus from Anthocercis littorea in south west Western Australia (Wylie, Li, and Jones 2014).",
