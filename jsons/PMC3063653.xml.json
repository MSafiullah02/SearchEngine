Systemic symptoms, including fever and chills, headache, myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia, develop early in the course of illness. Fever generally ranges from 100 \u00b0F to 104 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C), but may be as high as 106 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), with peak temperatures on the first day of symptoms and decreasing over three to eight days thereafter. While respiratory symptoms, including dry cough, pharyngeal pain, and nasal congestion and discharge, are also found, it is the presence of systemic symptoms that clinically differentiates influenza from other viral upper respiratory tract infections. Cough and sore throat may persist for several days after systemic symptoms abate [1].",

Indeed, the 50% lethal dose of PR8 virus in mice carrying a knocked-in MX1 gene is >1000-fold higher than in the parental C57BL/6 strain [27], while the lethal doses of the highly virulent A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1) and 1918 pandemic strains are increased by >100-fold with the expression of Mx1 in BALB/C mice [28].",

This finding allowed the use of DBA/2J mice for the study of 2009 pandemic influenza viruses without adapting these new strains to the mouse model [32\u201335]. Although increased pathology in DBA/2J mice has been correlated with a heightened inflammatory response [29,30], a causal relationship has not been established. Higher cytokine levels in mouse strains with greater susceptibility may be simply the result of increased viral replication relative to that seen in more resistant mice. It does seem clear that differences in host genetics account for the differing susceptibilities of DBA/2J and C57BL/6 mice to influenza viruses: gene mapping studies using recombinant inbred progeny of DBA/2J and C57BL/6 strains identified three loci associated with resistance to influenza virus induced pathology and indicated that host resistance is a complex, multigenic trait [30].",

For this reason, the mouse model is most often used with influenza virus strains that have previously been adapted through serial passage in this host. In particular, the early human isolates, PR8 and WSN, have become the prototype lab strains used in the mouse model. Laboratory mice are highly susceptible to infection with these viruses and severe disease or death is observed following administration of relatively low doses [40]. Due to the fact that it has been in use for several decades, a number of distinct lineages of PR8 virus (with a range of 50% mouse lethal doses) exist in various laboratories [27]. For studies requiring an H3N2 subtype influenza virus, X31, a reassortant virus carrying the HA and NA genes of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) in the background of PR8, is often used [40\u201347]. The virulence of X31 to mice is intermediate between that of wild-type human H3N2 isolates and PR8, in that a dose of approximately 106 plaque forming units (PFU) of X31 is required to cause death in BALB/C mice [40,48]. As with the human-adapted influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses in general do not cause disease in mice. The mouse-adapted strain B/Lee/1940 does, however, bring about severe weight loss when a dose of 5 x 105 PFU is administered intranasally to BALB/C mice [49].",

            "text": "Although mouse adapted strains are needed to model seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus infections, certain influenza viruses cause disease in mice without prior adaptation. These include the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain [36], highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype [48,50\u201352], certain H7 subtype viruses [52\u201355], a subset of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses [56] and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strains [39,57,58]. The susceptibilities of BALB/C or C57BL/6 mice to infection with and disease induced by these viruses are indicated by their 50% infectious (ID50) and 50% lethal doses (LD50), respectively (summarized in Table 1). The body weight loss and mortality that result from infection allow the mouse model to be used to assess the efficacy of treatments and vaccination regimens specifically against these viral strains. Thus, the FDA approved antiviral drugs rimantidine and amantadine have been shown to be effective against the 1918 pandemic strain in a mouse model [59] and similar studies have determined that drugs currently in use for the treatment of seasonal influenza are also effective against H5N1 strains [51,60\u201364]. A number of antiviral drugs in the preclinical stages of development have furthermore been tested in mice with a lethal H5N1 influenza virus challenge [65\u201372] and inactivated viral vaccines based on historical H1N1 isolates have recently been shown to provide protection to mice challenged with a lethal dose of the 2009 pandemic strain, A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) [73].",

In general, human influenza viruses attach preferentially to sialic acid moieties with an \u03b12,6 linkage to galactose [77,78], and such receptors are abundant in human upper airways [79,80]. \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids are not, however, abundant in the mouse respiratory tract; instead, sialic acids with an \u03b12,3 linkage predominate in the airways of mice [37,79]. The relative lack of human influenza virus receptors in mice may explain why human isolates do not replicate well in this species without prior adaptation. Indeed, an examination of virus attachment to respiratory tissues ex vivo indicated that, while avian influenza viruses bound throughout the murine upper and lower airways, human strains attached at low levels only to cells of the alveoli; by contrast, human influenza viruses bound strongly to human tracheal and bronchial tissues [81].",

The signs of disease that develop and their severity depend upon the challenge dose administered. In most cases, however, a lethal dose is used resulting in a severe disease characterized by huddling; ruffled fur; lethargy; anorexia, which leads to weight loss; and death (euthanasia at a humane endpoint). Necropsy of mice with severe influenza reveals lung lesions characteristic of pneumonia, including pulmonary edema and inflammatory infiltrates [75,82\u201385]. Many HPAI viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes spread beyond the mouse respiratory tract to other tissues including the brain, spleen, thymus, kidney, liver and heart [48,52,53,55,76,82]. This systemic spread is possible due to the presence of a multi-basic cleavage site in the viral hemagglutinin protein and results in the development of additional disease signs not seen with viruses confined to the respiratory tract, such as hind leg paralysis and mild encephalitis [86,87]. Although it does not carry a multi-basic cleavage site, the mouse adapted strain, WSN, also spreads to the brain and causes neurological symptoms when administered intranasally at high doses [74].",

Unlike humans, mice do not develop fever following influenza virus infection; conversely, hypothermia has been reported [82,88\u201390]. In mice, viral replication and resultant tissue damage are concentrated in the lower respiratory tract rather than the upper airways [53,57,82,91]. Most likely as a consequence of this differing tropism, influenza in mice is generally more severe than what normally occurs in human hosts. In the case of HPAI viruses in mice, systemic spread is more pronounced than is seen in humans, where high viral titers are detected only in the respiratory tract [92]. Also, some H7 viruses are highly pathogenic in mouse but of low pathogenicity in humans; thus, even when mice are naturally susceptible to disease, virulence does not always correlate to that seen in humans [55]. Finally, neither coughing nor sneezing is observed in mice.",

In addition, viral titers, pathology scores, lung weights, oxygen saturation in the blood [93,94], and gross motor-activity levels [95] may be monitored. The main advantage of using the mouse model is that large numbers of animals may be used, allowing statistically robust data to be obtained easily. For this reason, initial in vivo safety and efficacy studies for antiviral drugs currently approved for use against influenza viruses were performed in the mouse model. The antiviral effects of the M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine were first demonstrated in vivo in mice [96\u201399]. More recently, Mendel et al. demonstrated that treatment of mice with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) enhanced survival and decreased viral load in the lung [100], while Sidwell and colleagues extended these findings to include effects of treatment on arterial oxygen saturation and lung consolidation [94]. Von Itzstein et al. employed the mouse model to show that zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) treatment by the intranasal, but not the intraperitoneal, route reduced lung titers in influenza virus infected animals [101]. Finally, the most recently approved antiviral for influenza, peramivir, was first demonstrated to increase survival, reduce viral load, and inhibit consolidation of the lungs in a mouse challenge model [102\u2013104].",

Male Manor Farms (MF-1) or CFW mice were found to transmit influenza viruses by both aerosol and contact routes. The efficiency of transmission varied with the strain of influenza virus and ranged from 5% to 62.5% in this system. The influenza viruses used included mouse adapted H1N1 (PR8, NWS, A/CAM/46, A/FM/1) and H2N2 (A/Ann Arbor/6/1960 and A/Japan/305/1957) strains, as well as one H2N2 isolate that had not been serially passaged in mice. In general, H2N2 subtype viruses were found to transmit more readily than H1N1 strains, and the non-mouse-adapted H2N2 virus transmitted with 30% efficiency [108]. More recent attempts to model influenza virus transmission in BALB/C mice have been unsuccessful: direct contact transmission failed to occur when mice infected with high doses of the mouse adapted WSN strain, the 1918 pandemic virus, a highly pathogenic H5N1 isolate, human seasonal H1N1 or the 1968 H3N2 pandemic strains were co-caged with na\u00efve mice [112]. The reason for the discrepancy between the work of Schulman and colleagues and more recent efforts to study influenza virus transmission in mice is unclear, but differences in mouse strains and husbandry practices seem likely to play a role (e.g. bacterial co-infection may have been more prevalent in the vivaria of the 1960s). It is also of note that the studies reported in [112] did not include an H2N2 subtype influenza virus.",

Three days post-inoculation, animals developed signs consistent with human influenza disease, including fever, nasal discharge, lethargy, weakness, and anorexia; after a variable period of illness, from three to 10 days, the ferrets recovered uneventfully [119].",

Virus histochemistry studies have demonstrated that seasonal human strains of H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes attach predominantly in the upper respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi) of both humans and ferrets. In contrast, an H5N1 avian influenza virus attached relatively more abundantly in the lower respiratory tract (alveoli and bronchioles) of both species. These studies suggest that different tissue tropism of influenza viruses of human and avian origin may explain, in part, their different patterns of disease, and highlight a similarity between human and ferret influenza virus infections [145,146].",

All three clinically available neuraminidase inhibitors \u2013 oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir \u2013 have shown efficacy in the ferret model, as measured by a reduction of influenza virus shedding in the nares, a decrease in febrile response or other inflammatory markers, or, in the case of high-pathogenicity avian viruses, improved survival of ferrets inoculated with a lethal dose [100,101,147,148]. A study by Boltz et al. demonstrated that oseltamivir, when given prophylactically prior to infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), can mitigate weight loss and fever, reduce viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract, and prevent death in ferrets [129]. Similar studies have been done with experimental antivirals, such as DAS181 (Fludase\u00ae), a recombinant fusion protein that blocks influenza virus infection by eliminating cell surface viral receptors. In ferrets, a related construct DAS178, when administered from two days prior to five days after inoculation with influenza A/Bayern/7/95 (H1N1)-like virus, was shown to prevent infection in three of 12 ferrets and to alter the kinetics of nasal viral shedding in the remainder; all animals had significant reduction in the presence of inflammatory cells in nasal washes [66].",

            "text": "While ferret influenza mimics well the disease in humans, there are differences in drug pharmacokinetics in ferrets and humans. When testing oral compounds in animal models, differences in bioavailability among different species must be taken into consideration. As an example, oseltamivir phosphate \u2013 the ester prodrug of the active molecule oseltamivir carboxylate \u2013 is >75% orally bioavailable in humans [149], but only 30% bioavailable in mice and 11% in ferrets [150]; thus, dosages must be altered accordingly when assessing the activity of an oral compound in animal models. Similarly, different pharmacokinetics and toxicities can be observed in different species. In 1965, Cochran et al. found that the M2 ion channel inhibitor amantadine, when administered in doses tolerable in mice and men, caused lethal seizures in ferrets. At lower doses, experimental ferrets tolerated the drug, but those infected with the PR8 strain and treated either orally or subcutaneously with amantadine actually showed more viral lung pathology than infected animals given saline placebo [151]. Squires et al. later confirmed this report, showing that amantadine treatment had no ameliorating effect on either fever or clinical symptoms of sneezing, cough, and rhinorrhea [152]. In another study, Fenton et al. demonstrated similar toxicity and lack of efficacy in ferrets treated with oral amantadine; however, when treated with a lower dose of aerosolized amantadine, delivered by inhalation, ferrets infected with two different influenza A/H3N2 strains showed a reduction in nasal virus shedding and fever, without toxic effects [153]. Thus, the systemic toxicity of the amantadine limited the use of the ferret model to study its antiviral effects; when delivered locally, by inhalation, the drug worked as expected. Herlocher et al. later demonstrated that amantadine treatment (albeit at a lower dose than prior studies) also had no effect on development and duration of fever and or nasal virus shedding, but within five to six days of infection, the challenge virus developed amantadine resistance mutations in the M2 ion channel protein in four of nine amantadine-treated ferrets [154].",

The influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were caused by avian\u2013 human reassortant influenza viruses; however, the relative contribution of human internal protein genes or other molecular changes to the efficient transmission of influenza viruses among humans remains poorly understood. As in humans, most high pathogenicity avian influenza strains transmit poorly among ferrets. Maines et al. used the ferret model to assess whether reassortants between H5N1 avian and H3N2 human isolates might confer improved transmissibility among mammals. In this model, an H3N2 reassortant virus with avian virus internal protein genes exhibited efficient replication but inefficient transmission, whereas H5N1 reassortant viruses with four or six human virus internal protein genes exhibited reduced replication and no transmission. These results highlight the complexity of the genetic basis of influenza virus transmissibility and suggest that currently circulating avian H5N1 viruses may require further adaptation to acquire the enhanced mammalian transmissibility essential for pandemic spread [156].",

Belser and colleagues compared H7 viruses of the Eurasian and North American lineages, assessing their receptor-binding preference by glycan array and then evaluating their transmissibility by direct contact in the ferret model. They found that two highly pathogenic avian viruses of the Eurasian lineage, both of which express H7 hemagglutinins with avian receptor-binding preference, demonstrated different transmissibility among ferrets; the first, NL/219, did not transmit between any of the three ferret pairs tested, while the second, NL/230, transmitted between two of three ferret pairs. In comparison, two North American lineage H7 viruses, NY/107 and Ck/Conn, both exhibited enhanced human receptor-binding preference and decreased binding to avian-type receptors, with NY/107 showing the most significant decrease in avian receptor preference. However, Ck/Conn transmitted poorly, between only one of three ferret pairs, while NY/107 transmitted very efficiently, between three of three ferret pairs [135]. These studies highlight the complex role of hemagglutinin receptor-binding preference in the mammalian transmissibility of influenza viruses. An avian receptor-binding preference, as measured by glycan-array technology, does not preclude reasonably efficient mammalian transmissibility of influenza viruses, nor is enhanced human receptor-binding preference alone sufficient for the efficient transmission of avian strains.",

Though two of the five isolates transmitted between ferrets by direct contact, no aerosol transmission was observed. The authors found that a leucine residue at amino acid position 226 in the hemagglutinin receptor-binding site, responsible for human virus-like receptor specificity, was also important for ferret transmission [136]. The same group also studied a human-avian reassortant virus \u2013 expressing the surface proteins of an avian H9N2 virus in a human H3N2 backbone \u2013 which initially could not transmit via respiratory droplets among ferrets. However, after 10 serial passages of this reassortant virus through ferrets, the adapted virus acquired the ability transmit efficiently among ferrets in separate but adjacent cages. Sequence analysis of the passage-10 virus revealed only five amino acid changes relative to the passage-0 reassortant; experiments to identify the minimal changes necessary for transmission by respiratory droplet implicated three key changes in the HA and NA proteins [157]. These studies show that aerosol transmission is not exclusive to H1, H2, and H3 influenza subtypes, and they suggest that reassortants between human H3N2 and avian H9N2 viruses require little adaptation for efficient mammalian transmission by respiratory droplets.",

In this study, four pairs of ferrets were tested with each virus. Among the pairs inoculated with the pandemic H1N1 strain, virus was isolated from the nasopharynges of all four exposed animals. However, in those inoculated with the seasonal A/H1N1 virus, live virus could be isolated only from three of the four contact ferrets; in the fourth animal, viral nucleic acids were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) alone. Although these data clearly showed that the pandemic H1N1 virus transmits efficiently, due to the small number of ferrets tested, it is unclear whether the pandemic virus may actually transmit better than the older seasonal strain.",

They found that one mutant virus, with a glutamic acid-to-valine substitution at position 119 of the viral NA (NA-E119V) transmitted similarly to the wild-type virus, but that the other mutant virus, with an arginine-to-lysine substitution at position 292 (NA-R292K) demonstrated poorer transmission efficiency. However, these experiments were performed with only one set of three ferrets for each virus, with one animal being the inoculated donor and the other two ferrets the na\u00efve contact animals in the same cage; thus, two transmission events per virus, from a single donor animal, were assessed.

Consistent with this relative lack of disease, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses do not appear to spread systemically in guinea pigs: virus was not detected in the spleen, kidney, colon or brain of intranasally inoculated animals [168], and productive infection did not result from intragastric inoculation [166]. Infection of guinea pigs with epidemic human strains or 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses does not lead to fever, weight loss, lethargy, coughing or sneezing; increased production of mucus in the nasal passages is, however, apparent starting approximately four days after infection.",

Viral titers in infected animals and transmission to contacts, by contrast, can be quantified through very simple procedures that do not require the harvesting of tissues. Namely, the collection of nasal washings over a time course of exposure and/or serological analysis performed two weeks or more after the exposure are used to monitor transmission. In this way, the guinea pig model can be used to assess the efficacy of various interventions in decreasing viral load and limiting influenza virus transmission [160,164,165]. Similarly, the guinea pig is a convenient model in which to examine the potential for drug resistant strains of influenza to spread. By performing relatively simple transmission experiments using either the wild type A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus or recombinant strains in which oseltamivir resistance mutations had been introduced, we found that the mutant viruses examined transmitted with equal efficiency to the wild type by a contact route, but transmitted poorly or not at all by aerosol [169].",

Live viruses can be attenuated by passaging them at decreasing temperatures, thus adapting them to grow optimally at lower temperatures and creating a \u201ccold-adapted\u201d or \u201ctemperature-sensitive\u201d phenotype. A virus adapted to grow at 33 \u00b0C, when inoculated into the nose of a vaccinee, will replicate well in the nasopharynx and stimulate an immune response, but lower respiratory tract replication at 37 \u00b0C will be inhibited. Like humans, the core body temperature of the hamster is 37 \u00b0C, so they are an ideal species to study the efficacy of cold-adapted virus vaccines. In 1971, Mills et al. demonstrated that an H2N2 virus, cold-adapted in vitro, also displays an attenuated phenotype in hamsters. Whereas the wild-type virus replicated to high lung titers within one day of intranasal inoculation, cold-adapted viruses achieved peak lung titers that were 10 to 1000-fold lower and one to two days later than the parental virus [182]. Abou Donia et al. later confirmed that temperature-sensitive influenza virus mutants showed reduced growth in the lungs, but not the nasal turbinates, of hamsters, similar to the phenotype of these viruses in man [183].",

They found that the antibody response was enhanced not only by prior infection with live, heterosubtypic influenza A viruses but also by prior immunization with inactivated, adjuvanted, heterosubtypic influenza A virus vaccines. Thus, hamsters pre-infected with a live virus required a lower dose of heterosubtypic vaccine to stimulate the equivalent antibody response as an uninfected, vaccinated animal. However, in hamsters, the priming effect was lost when live-virus pre-infection preceded inactivated-virus vaccination by 20 weeks or more, although antibodies to the pre-infecting virus could still be detected out to 32 weeks post-infection. In contrast, no priming effect was seen with influenza B viruses, although infection with these viruses did occur, as demonstrated by serum hemagglutination inhibition after infection [180].",

Transmission was defined by seroconversion in the exposed recipient hamsters, as a four-fold rise in anti-hemagglutinin antibody titer at 14\u201321 days post-inoculation. They found that viruses more virulent in man tended to achieve higher nasopharyngeal titers and to transmit more efficiently to na\u00efve hamsters (Table 2). However, the relationship between maximal nasal wash titer and transmissibility was not absolute; the viruses A/Finland/74 (H3N2) and A/USSR/77 (H1N1) achieved similar nasal wash titers, but the transmissibility was vastly different, with 100% transmission (11 of 11 hamsters) by the H3N2 virus and 0% (0 of 11 hamsters) by the H1N1 strain.",
