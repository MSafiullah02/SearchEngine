Approximately 733,275 households (18% of those who are renting) are at risk of homelessness at any time, due to housing affordability issues, with more than 50% of their income being put toward rent 2. In recent years, as more people have experienced housing insecurity, there has been increased demand for governments, non-profit organizations, and communities to respond to the complex needs of this population 3\n,\n4\n,\n5. Inconsistent definitions for \u2018homelessness\u2019 and difficulties identifying this population (due to transient lifestyles and intermittent use of community services), have created distinct challenges in responding to needs 6.",

Gaetz 4 described how previously the lack of a National Housing Strategy, combined with shifts in government policies and reduced support for low-income families, has led to increased prevalence of homelessness. An important advance in the last year has been the introduction of Housing First legislation across Canada, which is a system-level intervention to address housing availability and accessibility among people who are chronically or episodically homeless 2. These settings-based interventions are needed to reduce inequities and enhance adaptive capacity by addressing macro-level influences on social determinants of health 20.",
