            "text": "There are currently several factors that are creating pressure to improve delivery systems for vaccines. First, in the current regulatory environment, there is a growing requirement to develop vaccines that are very well defined in molecular terms. Thus, as opposed to using whole-inactivated pathogens presenting a complex range of antigens, most newly developed vaccines are rather based on selected target antigens. In some cases these may be single molecules, or even fragments thereof, derived from an infectious micro-organism, a tumour cell, an allergen or an auto-antigen. The target molecule may be administered as a purified protein or as a peptide(s), or may be expressed from plasmid DNA or a recombinant virus. Often, such molecular vaccines are poorly immunogenic, implying a need for an adjuvant, a specific formulation or a vector system of enhanced immunogenicity1. Second, although in the past most vaccines have been designed to stimulate antibody responses against surface molecules of bacteria or viruses, new generation vaccines are increasingly designed to elicit cellular immune responses, especially of the Th1 type. Such responses are considered paramount for targeting chronic infectious diseases that may have an intracellular stage (associated for example with HIV1, herpes viruses, hepatitis C virus, Helicobacter pylori, Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), but also for the development of therapeutic vaccines against cancer, autoimmune diseases or allergies2. New vaccines are also being developed to elicit mucosal immune responses in humans, for example to protect against pathogens such as influenza virus, HIV1, HSV or human oncogenic or wart-associated papilloma viruses. Unlike most of the traditional vaccines, these efforts require the recruitment of cellular or mucosal immune effector mechanisms and necessitate the exploration of new routes of administration, new formulations, and new adjuvant systems3. Third, improving vaccine administration generally, either for the physician, or more importantly for the customer, towards pain-free and safe needle-less devices is likely to represent a major driver in the future vaccine market.",

Some of these adjuvants may facilitate long-term persistence of the antigen at the injection site (the so-called \u2018depot\u2019 effect).

To elicit mucosal immunity, many approaches have exploited soluble holotoxins mixed with antigen, such as the holotoxin from Vibrio cholerae (CT), from E. coli (heat labile LT), or Bordetella pertussis (PT). In humans, CT is highly toxic, therefore attempts have focused on the use of the CTB subunit, which can bind to the widely expressed GM1 ganglioside, but lacks the toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the A subunit. More recently, genetically detoxified toxins, which lack the ADP ribosyltransferase activity but retain most of their adjuvant properties have been developed5.",

            "text": "Apart from simply admixing the antigen with the adjuvant, formulation strategies may aim to facilitate the capture and the entry of the antigen into antigen presenting cells. For example, formulating T-cell antigens, expressed as peptides, proteins, plasmid DNA or even RNA into cationic liposomes appears to increase CTL responses in vivo in animal models12,13. Liposomes are artificial, spherical, closed vesicles which consist of one or more lipid bilayers. Liposome-encapsulated antigens are delivered more efficiently to the cytoplasm of APCs, presumably as a result of membrane fusion. Usually, liposomes are made from ester phospholipids. More recently, polar phospholipids from archebacteriae have also been used, leading to so-called \u2018archeosomes\u201914. The latter are based on regularly branched phytanyl chains, with 20 or 40 carbon length. Archeosomes demonstrate better stabilities to high temperature, alkaline pH, serum proteins, when compared with conventional liposomes. Other formulations being explored include spherulites (multilamellar vesicles made of biocompatible amphiphiles) and transfersomes (highly deformable vesicles which can deliver small molecules non-invasively through the skin)13,15. One liposome-based approach has proven successful in humans: in this approach, antigens derived from the hepatitis A or influenza virus have been incorporated into a mixture of natural and synthetic phospholipids, called virosomes (Table 1). Such vaccines were shown to be well tolerated and to induce both a 100% seroconversion rate and high antibody titres within 2 weeks10.",

Such formulations also facilitate phagocytosis and fluid phase internalization of the antigen by macrophages and dendritic cells, with subsequent transfer into the class I and class II presentation pathways, with up to a 1000\u201310,000-fold increased efficiency as compared to soluble antigen12. Microparticulate antigen presentation systems, when given orally, deliver the antigen to the mucosal surface, where they are captured by specialized microfold or M cells, prior to transfer to Peyer's patches, thereby inducing mucosal immunity3. In addition, injectable microsphere formulations containing the target antigen(s) create a controlled-release mechanism allowing the possibility of providing disease protection after a single inoculation.",

Considering the complex and orchestrated series of events leading to an antigen-specific activation of the immune system, it is very unlikely that a single molecule or component will suffice as a Th1 adjuvant. Rather, it appears important to combine various molecules in order to achieve both recruitment, targeting, and activation/conditioning of APCs in the presence of the desired antigen1.",

In such approaches, cDNAs encoding one or several antigens, which may be whole or truncated, are inserted into the viral vector.

It should enable efficient presentation of expressed antigens to the immune system while preferably exhibiting low intrinsic immunogenicity so that it can be administered repeatedly to boost relevant specific immune responses. Indeed, the strong immunogenicity of adenoviral vectors has been a limiting factor for their use in gene therapy of cancer as well as in vaccination protocols requiring repeated administrations of the immunogen. The vector system must also meet criteria that enable its large scale industrialization. These include; efficient growth on a cell substrate acceptable to regulatory authorities; total genetic stability with respect to attenuation and presence of the foreign gene(s), scalability to tens of millions of doses; easy purification of the vector virus away from cellular debris, and stability in the final formulation15.",

Several have been based on attenuated virus strains that have themselves been used as vaccines (e.g. vaccinia virus, polio virus, yellow fever virus), whereas others have been specifically manipulated to minimize disease-causing potential while maximizing immunogenic potential15. Some viral vector systems take advantage of natural host restriction. For example, avipox virus-derived vectors which replicate in avian cells are unable to complete a full round of replication in human cells and are, therefore, apathogenic and unable to transmit person-to-person. They are, however, capable of infecting human cells and express the incorporated antigen gene. On the same concept, other viral vectors such as those based on alphaviruses, adeno-associated viruses and some herpes simplex viruses, have been engineered to remove critical genes required for generating completely infectious particles in humans cells15. These vectors require helper systems for their propagation in the laboratory. It may be, for vaccination purposes, an advantage for viral vectors to be able to infect human APCs, such as dendritic cells or macrophages. Cytopathic viral vectors can still induce immune responses following infection of APCs, suggesting that these cells retain their capacity to initiate immune responses, at least during the early phase of the infectious cycle. It may be that apoptotic bodies containing antigens and produced as a result of viral infection can be captured by uninfected APCs.\n",

VLPs based on capsid proteins from human papilloma viruses (HPV), parvovirus or rotavirus, have been produced and tested successfully in animal models (Table 2)16,17. Another potentially useful viral vector for vaccination purposes, which can accommodate a large nucleic acid insert, is based on coronavirus. This virus is responsible for respiratory (i.e. common cold) and also enteric diseases in humans and can be used specifically as a vector to elicit immune responses at mucosal surfaces. Given, however, that virtually all humans have developed antibodies to these viruses in prior exposure, the interest of coronavirus as a vector in humans remains to be demonstrated.",

In this approach, attenuated or mutant strains of both Gram-positive or Gram-negative intracellular bacteria can be used to administer DNA vaccines via mucosal surfaces, or as a direct delivery systems to target APCs18. In this regard, BCG, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhi, S. typhimurium, or Shigella flexnerii can be considered as vectors. After being phagocytosed by APCs, such bacteria can survive inside the cell, by either preventing the fusion of the phagolysosome with lysosomes, or by exiting from the phagosome into the cytosol where they can release the DNA18. Such DNA can subsequently enter the nucleus and express the encoded antigen, which can be presented by the APC in association with both MHC class I and class II molecules. Importantly, live, but not heat-inactivated, intracellular bacteria also exhibit a capacity to induce a potent maturation of dendritic cells, thereby optimizing the presentation of heterologous antigens19. When used as vectors in vivo to immunize mice, live intracellular bacteria have been shown to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against heterologous bacterial, viral and tumoural antigens, leading to protection against infectious or tumour challenge. Several Gram-negative bacteria were also found to deliver plasmid DNA to human dendritic cells in vitro18. As an alternative to using whole bacteria, attempts are being made to use bacterial proteins and lipoproteins as carriers for T-cell epitopes20: with this aim, outer membrane proteins (e.g. OmpA from Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Opr1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and bacterial toxins (e.g. the adenylate cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis) have been successfully engineered to accommodate peptides representing heterologous T-cell epitopes20,21. These bacterial proteins have the capacity to target the antigens to dendritic cells and to elicit, at least in murine models, strong CTL responses. The utilization of bacterial proteins as carriers for capsular polysaccharides as antigens has also been very successful (see article by Finn elsewhere in this issue).",

In contrast, when used in humans to immunize against HIV1 or P. falciparum antigens, these vaccines failed to elicit antibodies, even if cellular immune responses (CTLs) were detected when using milligram quantities of the vaccine22,23. Currently, attempts to further enhance immune responses elicited by DNA vaccines are focusing on codon optimization in order to enhance expression in eukaryotic cells, formulation with cationic lipids to improve targeting of APCs and cell entry, and design of DNA vaccines co-expressing the antigen with an immunostimulatory cytokine gene2. These approaches, which have given some encouraging results in terms of improvement of immunogenicity in animal models, are still unproven in humans. In another approach, microscopic particles have been coated with a plasmid encoding the hepatitis B surface antigen, and administered to seronegative human volunteers through the skin using the Powderject XR1 particle accelerator. The vaccine was well tolerated, but it failed to induce primary antibody responses24. Another trend today is to associate DNA with other vectors, as part of mixed (prime-boost) immunization regimens: associations for example between DNA and poxviruses, including vaccinia or the canarypox ALVAC, appear to be promising in order to induce both antibody and cellular responses in animals, and are now being tested in humans2.",

In humans, feeding of transgenic lettuce expressing HbsAg or of transgenic potatoes expressing E. coli LT or the Newcastle virus capsid protein also elicited significant levels of antigen-specific antibodies25. Plants represent cost-effective expression systems to produce large amounts of recombinant proteins. Such expression systems, however, might not be suitable when the vaccine antigen is a glycoprotein.

In this approach, DCs are traditionally expanded in vitro from monocyte-derived progenitors, and subsequently loaded with tumour-associated antigens in the form of peptides, proteins, recombinant viruses, plasmid DNA, RNA formulated with cationic lipids, or tumour lysates. DC-based cellular vaccines have been tested thus far in humans against the following cancers (and target antigens): B-cell lymphoma (Ig idiotypes), melanoma (MAGE1, MAGE3, MART1, tyrosinase, tumour lysates), bladder cancer (MAGE3), colorectal cancer (CEA), and prostate cancer (PSM-P1, PSM-P2, PSA, PAP)27. Collectively, these vaccines were very well tolerated, and elicited some level of antitumour CTL responses. Partial remissions and disease stabilization were observed in at least a fraction (usually in the range of 10\u201330%) of the vaccinees. Despite such encouraging results, procedures to prepare and load DCs with antigens remain expensive and cumbersome, making it difficult to apply on a large scale to current clinical practice. One alternative being explored in humans consists in isolating exosomes (subcellular organelles containing both MHC class I and II and T-cell co-stimulatory molecules) from DCs as a basis for a cell-free vaccine28. In animal models, exosomes isolated from tumour peptide-pulsed DCs could prime efficiently in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocytes capable of eradicating or suppressing growth of established tumours.",

When pressed onto the skin, the microprojections create mechanical pathways through the superficial skin, allowing intracutaneous delivery of the antigen to an average depth of 100 \u03bcm. The antigen dose administered can be controlled by the formulation, wearing time, and system size. The largest experience in the field of needle-free delivery to humans has been gained with a variety of jet-injectors able to deliver vaccines by the subcutaneous route32,33. These devices use forces derived from two sources of power, either a spring or compressed gas, to propel the vaccine through the skin. Needle-free injection was found to increase immune responses to both conventional and DNA-based vaccines: for example, seroconversion rates as well as antibody titres elicited in humans by a hepatitis A vaccine or a trivalent influenza vaccine were found to be increased by at least 10% when using needle-free injections, as opposed to needle and syringe administration34. Further work is required, however, to control the consistency of the pressure of injection to ensure proper delivery of vaccine to various types of skin. Also, the greater depth of administration, the greater discomfort. An advantage of spring-powered devices is that they are usually lighter and smaller than gas-powered devices. They are also more durable and inexpensive. Coiled springs, however, provide only a limited pressure. In contrast, gas-operated devices are more powerful. As such, they allow the administration of larger volumes through both the subcutaneous and intramuscular route. The gas cartridge needs, however, to be replaced regularly, making these usually large devices more costly than systems operated with a coiled spring.
