In the last 10 years, however, studies of F344 and other rat strains (Orentreich et al ., 1993; Richie et al ., 1994 Richie et al ., , 2004 Zimmerman et al ., 2003) have shown that maximal lifespan can be extended by diets in which cystine and cysteine are absent and methionine levels are as low as possible. Rats fed this methionine-restricted (Meth-R) diet are light in weight, but consume more total calories per gram body weight than control rats (Meth-C) fed a diet with higher levels of methionine (Orentreich et al ., 1993) . Maximum lifespan of F344 inbred rats is extended by about 45% in at least two independent studies (Orentreich et al ., 1993; Richie et al ., 1994) , and there is suggestive preliminary evidence (Zimmerman et al ., 2003) that the Meth-R diet extends lifespan in at least three other rat stocks that are not subject to the nephropathy and testicular tumors that characterize the F344 stock. Pair-feeding studies, in which rats are fed the Meth-C diet at the levels consumed by the Meth-R rat group, have shown that the lifespan extension seen in the Meth-R rats is not attributable to their slightly lower per-rat energy intake. It is thus an open question as to what degree the mechanisms that lead to lifespan extension in Meth-R rats overlap the pathways that extend life and delay age-associated pathology in CR rodents. Nor is it clear whether the ability of low methionine diets to extend lifespan is limited to rats, or in contrast can be shown in other laboratory species of interest.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 136, "text": "(Weindruch & Walford, 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 137, "end": 161, "text": "Weindruch & Sohal, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 417, "end": 443, "text": "(Orentreich et al ., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 444, "end": 464, "text": "Richie et al ., 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 465, "end": 487, "text": "Richie et al ., , 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 488, "end": 512, "text": "Zimmerman et al ., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 853, "end": 879, "text": "(Orentreich et al ., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 980, "end": 1006, "text": "(Orentreich et al ., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1028, "text": "Richie et al ., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1101, "text": "(Zimmerman et al ., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We have therefore conducted a methionine-restriction experiment in a non-inbred but genetically homogeneous mouse strain, CB6F1, to evaluate the effects of this dietary regimen on lifespan, hormone levels and several age-sensitive traits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To test the idea that low methionine diets would extend lifespan in mice, as has been reported in rats (Orentreich et al ., 1993; Richie et al ., 1994; Zimmerman et al ., 2003) , we placed a group of CB6F1 female mice on a semi-purified diet containing 0.1% methionine at 6 weeks of age. Control mice were fed a semipurified diet similar in all respects except that it contained 0.43% methionine by weight. Methionine levels for the experimental group were increased to 0.12% when the mice reached 4 months of age, and again to 0.15% when the mice were 6 months of age, in an effort to reduce the proportion of experimental mice dying as a consequence of rectal prolapse. The experimental diet remained at 0.15% for the duration of the experiment. To test the hypothesis that reduction of methionine content from 0.43% to 0.15% reduced the palatability of the food, we conducted a short-term experiment in which food consumption was measured daily for five consecutive days in two cages of young adult female mice on the control diet, and in two cages of mice receiving the experimental diet; five cagedays were omitted when food shredding made it impossible to measure consumption accurately in a specific cage. Mice given the control diet consumed an average of 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 g day \u2212 1 (mean \u00b1 SD), as compared with 4.3 \u00b1 1.1 g day \u2212 1 for mice receiving the restricted diet. These data provide no evidence for the idea that the low-methionine food is less palatable than the control diet. Because both groups of mice were equivalent in body weight at the start (29.3 \u00b1 2.3 g) and end (28.8 \u00b1 1.9 g) of this 5-day period, the data are consistent with previous reports, from rat studies, that animals on the low-methionine diet consume at least as much food per gram body weight as controls. Figure 1 shows survival curves for the experimental and control groups. The left panel includes all of the mice entered into the study, and the right panel shows survival patterns for mice that were alive at the age of 365 days. It is clear that the experimental group had a higher risk of death in the first year of the protocol, but that this effect was diminished when methionine levels were raised to 0.15%. Survival at ages beyond 365 days was much higher in mice receiving the Meth-R diet. The log-rank test found the difference between the two groups significant at P = 0.02 when all mice were considered, and at P < 0.0002 when only those surviving more than 365 days were considered. At the time of writing (February 2005), 2/40 mice (5%) from the Meth-R group are still alive, and none of the 40 mice in the control group. The longest-lived mouse in the control group died at the age of 1150 days, an age at which 12/40 (30%) of the mice in the Meth-R group were still alive. Maximum lifespan of the control mice, estimated as the mean age of the oldest 10% to die (1144 \u00b1 26 days, mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4), is significantly less ( P < 0.002 by Student's t -test) than the corresponding value for the restricted mice (1261 \u00b1 32 days, a minimum estimate with 5% of the mice still living). Figure 2 shows mean body weight levels in mice of the control and experimental groups. Mean weight in the control mice rose steadily to a plateau level of 44 g at \u223c 18 months, and then declined steadily from 22 months onward, consistent with previous studies. Mice in the Meth-R group reached their highest average weight at 24 months of age, and were lighter than controls at all ages, averaging \u223c 65% of control weight between 6 and 18 months of age. Table 1 shows the results of serum hormone and fasting glucose levels measured at 16 months of age. Mice in the Meth-R group are significantly lower in serum IGF-I, and thyroxine (T4) levels. Serum insulin is approximately 25% of controls, and fasting glucose is reduced by about 50%.

Work reported by others has established the important point that rats on the Meth-R diet are in fact not calorie restricted to a significant degree, if at all. Food intake is higher per gram of body mass in Meth-R rats than in control rats (Orentreich et al ., 1993) ; in contrast, food intake per gram of body mass is not altered by the CR diet (Masoro et al ., 1992) . Rats on the Meth-R diet weigh 40% less than controls, but consume only 10% less food, and rats provided with a control diet in the same amount (per rat) as consumed by the Meth-R rats show only modest weight loss and minimal lifespan extension (Orentreich et al ., 1993) . Our own informal observations of Meth-R mice suggest that they eat more food than mice on the control diet, and urine output of the Meth-R mice is much higher than for controls, presumably due to the osmotic demands of excreting nutrients that cannot be incorporated into protein due to limiting levels of methionine and/or cyst(e)ine. A short-term food consumption trial showed that mice placed on the low-methionine diet eat as much food as mice placed on the (control) diet with higher levels of methionine, refuting the idea that the lowmethionine food source was so unpalatable that the mice lost weight because of voluntary food restriction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 745, "end": 771, "text": "(Orentreich et al ., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 851, "end": 873, "text": "(Masoro et al ., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1146, "text": "(Orentreich et al ., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Clearly a great deal more work will need to be done to see what aspects of aging are retarded by the Meth-R diet, and to learn about the ways in which Meth-R and CR rodents do and do not resemble one another.
