Both physicians and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are deeply concerned that immunosuppressants or biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. IOIBD has put in place an international registry, SECURE-IBD, for tracking all the cases with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) infected by COVID-19 (SECURE-IBD Registry. http://www.covidibd.org). It will describe the outcomes of infected patients and the association between IBD-related medications and these outcomes.",
