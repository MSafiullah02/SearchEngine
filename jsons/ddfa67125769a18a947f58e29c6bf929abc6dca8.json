Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three 25 of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally 26 mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two 27 antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most 28 potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, 29 while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies 30 against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 31 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt 32 the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without 33 undergoing extensive maturation.

The 108 specificity of this response was confirmed by the absence of S2P reactivity by serum 109 antibodies isolated from donors collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or donors 110 with confirmed infection by endemic coronaviruses. We also measured the serum 111 antibody response to RBD, and again observed specific high titers of binding antibodies 112 (Fig. 1B) . Isotype-specific ELISA revealed that the IgG titers were higher than the IgA and 113 the IgM titers to both S2P and RBD, suggesting a significant portion of the antibody 114 responses to SARS-CoV-2 S are IgG ( Fig. 1C and D) . The serum from the SARS-CoV-2 115 infected donor displayed potent neutralizing activity (Reciprocal ID50~3000)against a 116 pseudovirus expressing the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Fig 1E) . 117 We concluded that this donor had developed strong binding and neutralizing antibody 118 responses within three weeks of disease onset. 120 Fluorescently labeled S2P and RBD probes were used as baits to identify B cells specific 121 to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that were circulating at this timepoint. S2P was labeled with 122 either phycoerythrin (PE) or brilliant violet 711 (BV711) and used to stain B cells 123 concurrently. This double labeling strategy helps to discriminate between bona fide S2P- Among all successfully sequenced VH and VL transcripts, we obtained paired sequences 147 from forty-four. These were produced as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of 148 the IgG1 isotype and tested for binding to recombinant S-derived proteins (Fig. 3) . 149 All the mAbs bound to the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain, S2P ( Fig. 3A and E).",

The infection is caused by SARS-63 CoV-2, a beta coronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV (Wan et al., 2020). Presently the 64 immune response to COVID-19 is not well understood and preventative measures, such 65 as vaccines, are not available. It is also unclear which immune responses are required to 66 prevent or control SARS CoV-2 infection. 67 High resolution structures of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (S) ectodomain 68 revealed that it adopts multiple conformations with either one receptor binding domain 69 (RBD) in the \"up\" or \"open\" conformation or all RBDs in the \"down\" or \"closed\" 70 conformation, similar to previous reports on both SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S (Gui et 71 al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 72 2020; Walls et al., 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-73 CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor binding with 74 nM affinity (Li et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) (Hoffmann et al., 2020; 75 Letko et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). Indeed, the S proteins of the two viruses share a high 76 degree of amino acid sequence homology; 76% overall and 74% in RBD (Wan et al., 77 2020). 78 Although binding and neutralizing antibody responses are known to develop following 79 SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ni et al.; Okba et al., 2020), no information is currently available 80 on the epitope specificities, clonality, binding affinities and neutralizing potentials of the 81 antibody response. 82 Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from SARS-CoV-infected subjects can recognize 83 the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Yuan et al., 2020) and immunization with SARS S protein 84 can elicit anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in wildtype, and humanized mice, as 85 well as llamas (Walls et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020).

In contrast, CV5 180 and CV43, the other two anti-RBD mAbs and the CR3022 control, which binds the RBD 181 outside of the binding site, did not(Fig. 4C). We also measured the relative binding 182 affinities of CV30 and ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. ACE2 bound the RBD with an 183 affinity of 5.9 nM(Fig. 4D), while CV30 bound with a slightly higher affinity of 3.6 nM (Fig. 184 4E).

A recent report indicated that neutralizing antibodies 194 are present in the sera collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients (Ni et al.; Okba et 195 al., 2020). However, the kinetics of neutralizing antibody development as well as the 196 characteristics and epitope specificities of neutralizing antibodies generated during 197 SARS-CoV-2 infection are presently poorly understood. 198 Serological analysis revealed that this COVID-19-infected patient developed high titers of 199 binding and neutralizing antibody responses twenty-one days following infection. The 200 development of neutralizing antibody titers at this early timepoint has been reported for 201 other COVID patients (Ni et al.; Okba et al., 2020) and is consistent with the rapid 202 development of neutralizing responses to SARS-CoV infection (Corti et al., 2011). At this 203 time point, IgG constituted the major fraction of anti-S2P and anti-RBD serum antibodies, 204 although both IgM and IgA antibodies against these viral antigens were detected in the 205 serum as well. The S2P-specific, class switched B cells circulating at this time point were 206 not dominated by any particular clone. Rather, they were derived from a diverse VH/VL 207 gene repertoire, with frequencies similar to those reported in healthy uninfected 208 individuals (Briney et al., 2019; DeKosky et al., 2016; Soto et al., 2019; Vazquez Bernat 209 et al., 2019).",

However, two, CV1 and CV30, were able to 212 neutralize SARS-CoV-2. CV1 and C30 were derived from unique rearrangements among 213 all antibodies we examined. Thus, although diverse B cell clones became activated during 214 infection, the serum neutralizing activity is due to a relatively small subset.215CV1 binds to an unknown epitope region outside of the RBD, but the more potent CV30216 recognizes the RBD and likely neutralizes infection by directly inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S 217 binding to the ACE2 receptor. The RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies in 218 SARS-CoV infection (Cao et al., 2010). Several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that 219 block the interaction of SARS-CoV with the ACE2 receptor have been described (Hwang 220 et al., 2006; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Rockx et al., 2008; Sui et al., 2004; Walls et al., 221 2019). Moreover, the neutralizing potency correlated with the degree of S-ACE2 inhibition 222 (Rockx et al., 2008). The RBD of MERS-CoV is also a target of potent neutralizing 223 antibodies (Jiang et al., 2014; Niu et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2014), 224 highlighting the importance of receptor blocking antibodies for coronavirus vaccine 225 development. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share extensive amino acid 226 sequence in the receptor binding domain (74%) and both viruses utilize human ACE2 for 227 entry, the amino acid identity in the receptor binding motif is only ~50% (Wan et al., 2020). 228 In line with this, potent anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind RBD 229 fail to cross react with SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020), similarly the anti-RBD mAb, 230 CV30 described herein fails to cross react with the SARS-CoV spike protein. 231 Consistent with the short time period post-infection, the majority of S-specific BCRs from 232 individual B cells were unmutated or had only accumulated very few mutations. This was 233 true for the neutralizing antibodies as well. CV1 was unmutated from germline, while 234 CV30 had 2 amino acid mutations in VH and none in VL. Largely unmutated antibodies 235 12 against SARS-CoV S (Prabakaran et al., 2006; Sui et al., 2004) and MERS-CoV S (Jiang 236 et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2015) have been isolated 237 from phage display libraries created from uninfected donors. 238 Potent anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind RBD are derived 239 from different VH genes (VH1-18, VH1-69, or VH3-30) than CV30 (Prabakaran et al., 240 2006; Sui et al., 2004; Traggiai et al., 2004; Walls et al., 2019). Anti-RBD antibodies that 241 neutralize MERS are derived from diverse gene families (Jiang et al., 2014; Niu et al., 242 2018; Tang et al., 2014). 243 Collectively these results indicate that high-affinity coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies 244 require a short developmental pathway. This suggests that a vaccine against this virus 245 may only need to activate a subset of B cells for potent neutralizing antibody responses 246 to be developed, and that potent neutralizing antibodies are not V-gene restricted. 247 In sum, we provide information on the characteristics of early antibody and B cell 248 responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during infection. Moreover, the neutralizing 249 antibodies discussed here can serve as templates for the design of immunogens and 250 potentially have utility as therapeutic and prophylactic agents to combat the SARS.
