            "text": "After virus infection, most mammalian cells develop an antiviral response that is triggered by detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including single-stranded and double-stranded viral nucleic acids. Viral PAMPs are detected by specific host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), RIG-I-like receptors (MDA5 and RIG-I) and DNA sensors (cGAS, DAI, IFI16, DHX9, and DHX36) in the endosome and within the cytoplasm [1], [2], [3]. Binding of viral PAMPs to PRRs triggers signaling pathways that induce the expression of virus-responsive genes and antiviral cytokines (e.g., type I interferon (IFN)), which limit virus replication and shape adaptive immunity.",

Type I IFN signaling is mediated through the heterodimeric IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits [5]. Signal transduction following the binding of type I IFN to IFNAR occurs via Janus kinase (JAK) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3, which is comprised of IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and phoshorylated STAT1 and STAT2), and induction of hundreds [6], [7], [8], [9] of different IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological functions that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including entry, translation, replication, assembly and spread. Additionally, some ISGs have immunomodulatory activity including effects on leukocyte recruitment and priming of adaptive immunity.",

Three members are expressed in mice: Ifit1 (Isg56), Ifit2 (Isg54), Ifit3 (Isg49) and are located on chromosome 19qC1. Additional less characterized yet highly related IFIT genes (IFIT1B (human) and Ifit1b, Ifit1c and Ifit3b (mouse)) in syntenic regions of the chromosome exist, although their functional significance remain undefined. A non-transcribed IFIT1-related pseudogene is present on human chromosome 13 [17]. IFIT genes share a similar genomic structure with most composed of two exons, with the second exon containing the vast majority of the coding sequence. IFIT1 gene homologs exist in other mammalian species as well as birds, fish and amphibians (reviewed in [18]).",

Proteins containing TPR motifs regulate the cell cycle, transcription, protein transport, and protein folding [19]. Different IFIT family members have distinct numbers and arrangements of TPR motifs (Fig. 2B), which likely dictate unique functions; for example, IFIT1 has six and IFIT2 has four. Human and mouse IFIT1 share a sequence identity of 53% at the amino acid level, and have varied relatedness (\u223c38\u201357%) to other IFIT homologs within a given species. Although the sequence similarity between the different IFIT proteins within a species is high [18], their distinct effects on replication of individual viruses suggest they serve non-redundant functions in the host response to viral infections [20], [21], [22].",

IFIT genes were described as viral stress-inducible genes [23] and are induced at the transcriptional level directly by IRF3 [34], [35], which is activated soon after viral infection (via a MAVS or STING-dependent signal), often prior to the induction of type I IFN. Other IRF proteins (such as IRF1, IRF5, and IRF7) can induce the expression of IFIT genes directly [36], [37], although these pathways remain less well defined. Some IFIT genes, including human IFIT1B, lack ISRE-containing promoters and presumably are not induced by type I IFN or IRF-dependent signals [38]. Human IFIT genes also are induced by retinoic acid [39], though the kinetics are slower and might be regulated by IFN\u03b1 induction [37].",

In the 2.8 \u00c5 resolution IFIT2 structure, monomers of IFIT2 had nine TPR motifs and formed domain-swapped homodimers. IFIT2 had an extensively positively charged C-terminal region that supported RNA binding with or without 5\u2032 triphosphorylation (5\u2032-ppp) [40]. Mutation or deletion of charged residues in this region that altered RNA binding to IFIT2 negatively affected antiviral activity against Newcastle disease and Sendai viruses when these IFIT2 variants were expressed ectopically in 293T cells [40]. This study also suggested that IFIT2 binds to RNA containing adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich elements. These are found in mRNA of some genes that encode cytokines or apoptotic factors and their targeting could contribute to how IFIT2 regulates inflammatory responses [44], [45].",

In IFIT5, 18 of its 24 \u03b1-helices form canonical TPRs with the remaining helices intervening between TPRs. This results in the formation of three distinct bundles of TPRs oriented in a V-like configuration to give the overall protein a clamp-shaped structure (Fig. 1\n). Structural analysis also revealed a helical domain containing a positively charged cavity that engaged a single-stranded 5\u2032-ppp RNA. Binding of 5\u2032-ppp RNA to IFIT1 and IFIT5 occurs in a non-sequence specific manner and requires an overhang of five and three 5\u2032 nucleotides, respectively. Mutation of residues that altered 5\u2032-ppp RNA binding to IFIT5 reduced antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis (VSV) or influenza (IAV) viruses when variant IFIT5 proteins were expressed ectopically in 293T cells.",

Analogous to studies with IFIT2, IFIT5 co-purification of cellular RNA or binding to tRNA was reduced by C-terminal truncation and mutation of positively charged residues in the cleft also diminished RNA binding activity [42]. Feng et al. described electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments in which IFIT5 bound with high-affinity (10\u2013100 nM) to poly A, poly U, and poly C single-stranded RNA and AT-rich double-stranded DNA [43]. C-terminal truncations and site-specific mutations of positively charged residues abolished the poly A single-stranded RNA and AT-rich double-stranded DNA binding activity of IFIT5. Collectively, these structural and biochemical studies show that IFIT5 binds to several types of RNA, and that its RNA binding ability contributes to its antiviral activity.",

The absence of 2\u2032-O-methylation on MHV-D130A viral RNA preferentially activated the MDA5-MAVS signaling pathway and also resulted in enhanced sensitivity to IFIT1 [53]. IFN-\u03b1 treatment preferentially inhibited infection of a human coronavirus (strain 229E) 2\u2032-O methyltransferase mutant (nsp16 D129A) in HeLa cells, and this restriction was linked to IFIT1 expression [54]. Consistent with this cell culture data, growth of MHV-D130A was partially restored in Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 animals. In studies with an analogously mutated SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), an nsp16-D130A mutation showed attenuated replication in human airway epithelial cells and wild type mice but was virulent in Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice [55].

The preferential binding of IFIT1 to cap 0 RNA was corroborated by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments [51]. A separate group ectopically expressed IFIT proteins and performed affinity purifications using capped RNA. Among the IFIT family members only human and murine IFIT1 were detected when capped RNA was used as bait [54]. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, this group showed that IFIT1 bound efficiently to cap 0 RNA but poorly to cap 1 RNA [54]. Primer extension assays showed that recombinant human and rabbit IFIT1 and IFIT1B bind cap-proximal regions of cap 0 mRNAs with high affinity (K\n1/2,app 9\u201323 nM). Methylation at the 2\u2032-O position abrogated IFIT1-mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap 1 mRNA with reduced affinity (K\n1/2,app\n \u223c 450 nM) [57].

Kimura et al. and Hyde et al. transfected luciferase reporter gene RNA with different 5\u2032 cap structures into IFN-primed wild type or Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and measured luicferase activity. Whereas cap 0 RNA showed reduced translation in wild type compared to Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, addition of 2\u2032-O methylation resulted in equivalent levels of translation in both wild type and Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells [51]. Habjan et al. used pulsed stable isotope labeling in cell culture to assess the impact of IFIT1 on global translation. Ifit1\n+/+ and Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 macrophages were infected with either MHV-WT or MHV-nsp16-D130A and analyzed by whole-proteome shotgun mass spectrometry. Translation of viral proteins was reduced selectively in Ifit1\n+/+ cells infected with MHV-nsp16-D130A [54]. Kumar et al. investigated the influence of IFIT1 on translation initiation using an in vitro reconstituted translation system and a toe-printing assay. 48S ribosomal complexes were assembled from individual purified 40S subunits, Met-tRNA, eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4F on cap 0 and cap 1 mRNA in the presence and absence of different IFIT proteins. At 800 nM, IFIT1 nearly abrogated 48S complex formation on cap 0 mRNA, whereas IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 did not affect 48S complex formation. Titration experiments showed that 48S complex formation on cap 0 mRNA was sensitive even to low (\u223c50 nM) concentrations of IFIT1 [57].

As translation of cellular mRNA requires binding of the cap-binding protein eIF4E [58], initial experiments tested whether IFIT1 could compete with eIF4E for binding to cap 0 mRNA as a means of selectively inhibiting translation. Cap 0 and cap 1 mRNA were coupled to beads and assayed for binding to recombinant eIF4E in the presence or absence of recombinant IFIT1. eIF4E interaction with bead-bound cap 0 but not cap 1 RNA was reduced by IFIT1, suggesting that the two proteins compete for the RNA target [54]. A subsequent study confirmed these results as IFIT1 binding to cap 0 mRNA was unaffected by a 10-fold excess of eIF4E or eIF4F [57]. Thus, the affinity of IFIT1 for cap 0 RNA enables it to outcompete eIF4E and eIF4F for binding and selectively prevents translation initiation (Fig. 2\n).",

Biochemical studies suggest that some IFIT family members reduce the efficiency of cap-dependent protein translation more generally by binding subunits of the eIF3 translation initiation complex [60]. Human IFIT1 and IFIT2 reportedly blocks binding of eIF3-mediated recruitment of the eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met-tRNA ternary complex to 40S ribosomes by interacting with eIF3e. In addition, human IFIT2, and mouse IFIT1 and IFIT2 reportedly inhibit the formation of the 48S pre-initiation complex by binding to eIF3c [20], [60], [61]. Recently, some of these results were questioned as addition of human IFIT1 failed to affect 43S complex formation irrespective of whether Met-tRNA, 40S subunits, or Met-tRNA and eIF2 were pre-incubated with excess IFIT1 [57].",

Examination of the cellular proteins associated with HCV-translation complexes in IFN-treated human cells showed that human IFIT1 is an eIF3-associated factor that fractionates with the initiator ribosome-HCV RNA complex [64]. IFIT1 suppressed IRES-dependent translation of HCV, whereas a mutant IFIT1 protein reportedly lacking eIF3-binding activity failed to inhibit HCV. Moreover, ectopic expression of IFIT1 decreased HCV infection in human hepatocytes [65].

These IFIT-dependent interactions were relevant against RNA viruses displaying a 5\u2032-ppp, as silencing of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in HeLa cells to varying degrees enhanced replication of the negative strand Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), VSV, and IAV.

The affinity of IFIT1 for 5\u2032-ppp RNA has been measured at \u223c250\u2013500 nM by surface plasmon resonance or filter binding assays [32], [56], which is at least 10-fold lower than that observed for cap 0 RNA, although one group failed to measure stable binding of IFIT1 to 5\u2032-ppp mRNA using a primer extension technique even at higher (1 \u03bcM) concentrations [57].

After the N-7 methylguanosine type 0 cap is added, the cap 1 structure is completed by the activity of a separate viral protein (VP39 encoded by J3 gene) that adds a 2\u2032-O-methyl group. The cap formation of flavivirus RNA also follows the conventional pathway of mRNA cap formation through sequential activities of the viral RNA triphosphatase (NS3 gene), guanylyltransferase (NS5 gene) and N-7 and 2\u2032-O methyltransferases (NS5 gene). Coronaviruses also are believed to produce mRNAs with a cap 1 structure through the \u201cconventional\u201d capping pathway although all of the component enzymes have not been defined.

Hepaciviruses and pestiviruses of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses lack a cap structure at their 5\u2032 end but encode for an IRES to initiate viral translation in a cap-independent manner. The HCV IRES directly recruits the 40S ribosome subunit to the translation initiator codon of the genome and does not require interactions with eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1, 1A, 4A, 4B and 4E [74]. Thus, in theory, HCV could still be translated even if IFIT1 were bound to the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. However, IFIT1 may block HCV translation through an independent mechanism by targeting eIF3-dependent steps in the viral RNA translation initiation process (see Section 4.3). Although other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses) encode IRES elements, there are differences in function and requirements for eukaryotic translation initiation factors (reviewed in [75]). Indeed, in contrast to HCV, the IRES-containing encephalomyocarditis virus (a picornavirus) is resistant to the antiviral effects of IFIT1 [32], [49].",

To promote their own survival, viruses have developed strategies to escape host recognition by interfering with antiviral detection pathways, signaling cascades, and effector mechanisms. IFIT1 is an IFN-induced highly expressed protein that functions in the cytoplasm as a dual sensor and effector molecule to restrict virus infection. IFIT1 preferentially recognizes non-2\u2032-O methylated or uncapped non-self viral mRNA and suppresses translation initiation or sequesters the RNA from active replication. IFIT1 likely contributes to a species barrier that puts evolutionary pressure on viruses to generate mRNA with host cap structures. \u2018Successful\u2019 or pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to produce mRNA with 5\u2032-ends that mimic host cellular mRNAs, including viral RNA with N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation through several independent strategies (encoding capping machinery, \u2018cap-snatching\u2019, or using host capping machinery). Viruses also can avoid or attenuate IFIT1 restriction by using cap-independent translation mechanisms, covalent binding of viral proteins to the 5\u2032-end of the RNA, or evolving secondary structures at their 5\u2032-end that inhibit IFIT1 binding and function. As both host and many viral mRNA share 2\u2032-O methylation, higher eukaryotic cells may be trapped into retaining this modification, despite its relative lack of protective effect against viral pathogens [84]. A deeper mechanistic understanding of IFIT1 biology could facilitate the development of novel antiviral agents that target viral methyltransferases or other proteins to re-sensitize pathogenic viruses to the inhibitory activities of IFIT1.",

(Left) Viral mRNA with cap 1 structures (N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation) recruit eIF4E and initiates translation and polyribosome formation. IFIT1 binds poorly to cap 1 mRNA. (Right) Viral mRNA with cap 0 structures lacking 2\u2032-O methylation are recognized by preferentially by IFIT1, which prevents binding of eIF4E and efficient translation.

            "text": "Fig. 3: Mechanisms of evasion of IFIT1 by viruses. Different families of RNA and RNA viruses use distinct mechanisms to evade IFIT1-dependent restriction. These include: (i) viral-encoded N-7 and 2\u2032-O methyltranferases (MTase) to generate a cap 1 structure on their mRNA (flavivirus, coronavirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, reovirus, and poxvirus), which prevents IFIT1 binding; (ii) use of host-encoded N-7 and 2\u2032-O methyltranferases (MTase) in the nucleus to generate a cap 1 structure on their mRNA (herpesvirus, retrovirus, bornavirus, parvovirus, polyomavirus, and papillomavirus); (iii) \u2018cap-snatching\u2019 mechanisms to cleave cap 1 structures from host mRNA (10\u201320 nucleotides). The capped leader RNA is used to prime transcription on the viral genome, which leads to the synthesis of capped, translatable viral mRNAs (orthomyxovirus, arenavirus, and bunyavirus); (iv) RNA structural elements at the 5\u2032-end of type 0 capped alphavirus RNA antagonize IFIT1 binding and function; and (v) some positive sense RNA viruses utilize IRES elements to mediate cap-independent translation. For hepaciviruses and pestiviruses the 5\u2032-end remains as an uncapped 5\u2032-ppp RNA. Picornaviruses and caliciviruses covalently attach a viral protein (VPg) to the 5\u2032-end.
