However, pathogen detection in the initial stage of disease has long been a serious challenge, limiting the guiding function of pathogen detection. In 2008, the xTAG RVP assay based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allowed the simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory viruses, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.2 Since then, an increasing number of commercialized multiplex PCR kits have been developed, allowing the simultaneous detection of a large panel of viruses and atypical bacteria in clinical practice.3 Several studies used this molecular diagnostic tool to show that viral infections accounted for a large proportion of LRTIs. In addition, mixed infections were identified frequently.4, 5, 6\n",

Patients with positive bacterial culture were excluded while analyzing the impact of HPIV single infection and coinfection. HPIV\u2010positive patients were divided into three groups based on the test results: HPIV single infection, coinfection with other viruses, and coinfection with atypical bacteria. The diagnosis of LRTI for each patient was performed by at least two attending physicians based on Zhu Futang Practice of Pediatrics, 8th edition.11 It was defined according to the clinical symptoms, including severe cough, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, and respiratory distress signs such as nasal flaring, retraction, cyanosis, and abnormal auscultatory findings (wheezing and crackles), or radiologic evidence indicative of an LRTI. Clinical syndromes of bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia were included in the LRTI category. Bronchitis was diagnosed based on the clinical manifestations including severe cough with or without fever, symmetrical breath sounds without permanent rales on auscultation, and increased bronchovascular shadows in chest X\u2010ray examination. Bronchiolitis was recognized in patients aged <24 months with lower respiratory symptoms of wheezing, tachypnea, and signs of respiratory distress such as nasal flaring, intercostal/subcostal retractions, and central cyanosis. The diagnosis of pneumonia was established based on clinical findings, including fever, tachypnea, and respiratory distress, with the presence of focal or diffuse crackles, decreased vesicular sounds, and radiographic findings such as patchy and macular shadows and/or atelectasis, and/or air bronchograms. The pertussis\u2010like cough was defined based on clinical signs including spasmodic cough, inspiratory whoop, and posttussive vomiting.

Coinfection with other viruses was associated with running nose and shortness of breath, and more patients needed oxygen inhalation compared with patients with HPIV single infection. This indicated the mild presentation of HPIV single infection compared with that of coinfection with other viruses. However, another study found no difference.10 Many factors may be responsible for the absolute opposite conclusions, such as specific viruses involved in coinfection, order of infection, and number of viruses. Controlling these factors may be possible in an in vitro study, but this scenario is highly unlikely in patients. To date, a few experimental studies have been conducted on simultaneous respiratory infections, especially those caused by HPIV. It has long been known that simultaneous viral infections exhibit a phenomenon called viral interference, in which one virus blocks the growth of another virus.28 The effect depends on the virus causing the primary infection,29 number of viruses used to initiate an infection,30 speed of virus replication, and delay between initial and secondary infections.22 A study found that rhinovirus, the fastest\u2010growing virus, reduced the replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while the replication of parainfluenza virus, the slowest\u2010growing virus, was suppressed in the presence of other viruses.22 An early infection and a high number of viruses promote coinfection.22 Therefore, further studies should focus on the coinfection of specific viruses and confirm the course of virus infection.",
