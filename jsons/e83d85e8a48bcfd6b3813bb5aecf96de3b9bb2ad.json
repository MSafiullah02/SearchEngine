The key idea in group testing is to group (or, pool) multiple items (swabs or blood samples) and test each group rather than each individual. The output of the test will be negative if everyone in the group is healthy or else, the output will be positive. The objective of group testing is to design the testing scheme (or, pools) such that the total number of tests m to be performed is minimized. The remarkable result from group testing is that if p is small, the infected people can be identified from far fewer than n tests, i.e., the average number of tests per person can be substantially smaller than one. Group testing was first introduced to the field of statistics by Dorfman [2] during World War II for testing soldiers for syphilis without having to test each soldier individually. Since then, group testing has been used in such as clone library screening, non-linear optimization, multi-access communication etc.., [3] and fields like biology [4] , machine learning [5] , data structures [6] and signal processing [7] . In turn, advances in coding theory and multi-access communication have substantially advanced the field of group testing. A comprehensive survey of group testing algorithms can be found in [3] , [8] - [12] .",

However, in the worst case, we still require 3 tests and more importantly, since the tests are performed sequentially, the total time taken can be three times as long as in the non-adaptive case. Example 4. Sparsity-oblivious fully-adaptive (SOFA) group testing: One of the main advantages of the SOMS strategy is that it leverages parallel tests at some stages of the testing. This can significantly reduce the total testing execution time in order to identify all infected people in the population (on average). However, this advantage comes at the price of not being optimal in terms of the total number of tests. In what follows, we propose another testing strategy, referred to as the Sparsity-Oblivious Fully-Adaptive (SOFA) strategy, that will require less number of tests on average for a population of n = 4 people. It should be noted that the average execution time of SOFA is longer than that of SOMS. That is, the SOMS and SOFA strategies achieve different tradeoffs between the average number of tests and the average execution time.",

In order to choose the best action ((i) or (ii)) at each stage, the algorithm uses the number of infected people that have already been identified. When the number of already-identified infected people is relatively larger (or smaller) than the expected number of infected people (np), the action (i) (or (ii)) will be taken. This procedure is motivated by the fact that when the number of already-identified infected people is relatively large as compared to the expected number of infected people, most likely none of the remaining people are infected; and hence it would be more efficient (in terms of the number of tests) to perform one test on all unidentified people, instead of performing a binary search on them.",

A recent study in [13] shows that using the standard RT-PCR technology, with a false negative rate of about 10% a single infected individual can be identified in pools of size up to 32. This naturally raises a question about the robustness of the proposed scheme (for infection rate classification) to the accuracy of tests. In the following, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme in the presence of noisy test results when the noise is modeled as follows. Given that the hypothesis H i is true, we assume that the test result for a subpool not containing any infected people will always be negative with probability 1 (representing a false positive rate of 0%, or equivalently, a test specificity of 100%); whereas the test result for a subpool containing some infected individual(s) will be positive with probability \u03c1 i (representing a false negative rate of 1 \u2212 \u03c1 i , or equivalently, a test sensitivity of \u03c1 i ).",

For instance, in Table III, for N = 448 and L = 28, when \u03c1 = 100% we can achieve P D = 99.9% and P F = 4.6%, whereas when \u03c1 = 80%, P D = 99.1% and P F = 4.1% can be achieved. It should be noted that in order to achieve (almost) the same P D and P F for fixed N and L, the threshold V needs to be set to a smaller value as the sensitivity \u03c1 decreases. As a result, for a smaller sensitivity \u03c1 the average number of tests required for (almost) the same P D and P F is larger.
