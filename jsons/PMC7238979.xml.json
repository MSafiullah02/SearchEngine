The ST Score was designed to be incremental (Score=2n), to ensure cases in each Tier will not have a higher final START score (and lower priority) than the following less-acute Tier, unless the surgery would be highly resource-intensive with all four key resources utilised. As Life-threatening cases were intentionally assigned a score of 0, the START score of all emergency cases would be 0, indicating the default highest priority, regardless of the RU score.",

Lower START scores indicate more urgent and less resource intense cases, which should be accorded higher priorities. START proved effective with table-top-exercises based on different scenarios. Its ease of administration reduces stress associated with complex decision-making during the pandemic. It is also highly-applicable to other surgical disciplines. With any given amount of resources, and as local pandemic situations change, surgeons can prioritise surgeries based on START scores. It is our hope that sharing this easily-administered tool would enable Urologists worldwide to dynamically prioritise surgeries, tailored to their local prevailing pandemic circumstances.",
