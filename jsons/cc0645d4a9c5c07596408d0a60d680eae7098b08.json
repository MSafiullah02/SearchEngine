One of the best known of these is the word \"serendipity,\" fi rst used by Horace Walpole in a 1754 letter to his friend Horace Mann, alluding to the Persian folk tale of \"The Three Princes of Serendip\" (now called Sri Lanka). The princely trio had the facility of repeatedly making chance but happy discoveries. Dickson goes on to describe the words \"pandemonium\" (John Milton), \"chortle\" (Lewis Carroll), and \"butterfi ngers\" (Charles Dickens) as authorisms. My favorite: American scholar H.L. Menken, aka \"the sage of Baltimore,\" created the term ecdysiast, based on the word \"ecdysis,\" i.e., the process of shedding old skin, molting. This new word was his gift to famous striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee (immortalized in the movie Gypsy ), who sought a more elegant term to describe her role on stage [ 13 ] . The creation of the verb \"neologize\" has been attributed to President Thomas Jefferson, along with some 100 other words such as \"pedicure\" and \"indecipherable\" [ 14 ] .",

About this same time, Scottish surgeon and scientist Alexander Ogston gave us a new word, \" Staphylococcus ,\" coming from similar roots, and identifying bacteria seen occurring in clusters under the microscope [ 16 ] . \u2022 Phantom limb : The phenomenon of perceiving sensation, sometimes including pain, following amputation of a limb had been known as early as the time of Ambroise Par\u00e9 in the sixteenth century, but it was not until 1871 that American physician and writer Silas Weir Mitchell created the authorism \"phantom limb\" [ 18 ] . \u2022 Anesthesia : William T.G. Morton introduced us to ether insensitivity to pain, but Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. gave us the word \"anesthesia\" [ 19 ] . Billroth, considered by some to be the father of modern abdominal surgery [ 17 ] \u2022 [ 22 ] . A current Google search of the word \"diabesity\" yielded several dozen sites; Kaufman's neologism seems to have \"stuck.\" \u2022 Singularity : Also in 2005, futurist author Ray Kurzweil coined the term \"singularity\" to describe the time when humans and computers will merge as one through the addition of technological advances, such as tiny nanobots, to our brain function [ 23 ] . \u2022 iPatient : In 2008, American physician Abraham Verghese gave us the freshly minted word \"iPatient,\" to describe the virtual patient discussed by students and residents while viewing online laboratory reports \"in the bunker while the real patients keep the beds warm and ensure that the folders bearing their names stay alive on the computer\" [ 24 ] .",

When garment workers return after a weekend to a factory with the air laden with cotton dust, they may suffer \"Monday morning asthma.\" Then there is the \"Sleeping Beauty syndrome\" (a pathologic sleep disturbance). Sometime, somewhere, someone thought up all these descriptors. All were once freshly described neosyndromes. In the \"Alice in Wonderland\" syndrome, the patient experiences distorted perceptions of body images [ 29 ] \u2022 The Ulysses syndrome : We have an entire universe of iatrogenic syndromes caused by therapeutic misadventures. The Ulysses syndrome, fi rst described by Rang in 1972, is different. It is a side effect of investigation, and also might be identifi ed as the \"laboratory error syndrome\" or the \"top/bottom of the bell curve syndrome.\" The non-disease begins with the discovery of an unanticipated abnormality on a laboratory panel or roentgenogram. This prompts a return visit to the doctor, who dispatches the healthy patient on an odyssey of unnecessary testing, imaging, and perhaps scoping. The most serious risk of being the victim of the Ulysses syndrome is not the wasted time and money, but the very real possibility that the investigation might culminate in needless therapy or even invasive surgery [ 30 ] . \u2022 Legionnaires' disease : Legionnaires' disease was so named because the index cases were American Legion members all staying in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia in July 1976. The disease, of course, has no other connection with this respected veteran's organization, and I suspect its members wish the new disease had been named something else, perhaps the Bellevue-Stratford disease. But it may be too late to call it Philadelphia disease. \u2022 Kabuki syndrome : \"Kabuki syndrome,\" described by Kuroki in 1981, takes its name from the facial similarity of patients to the makeup of actors in traditional Japanese Kabuki Theater. Those affl icted have large ears, elongated palpebral fi ssures, a depressed tip of the nose, skeletal abnormalities, and mental retardation [ 31 ] . \u2022 SARS : In 2003, we witnessed the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which began in China, and, thanks to the miracle of modern air travel, eventually killed 775 persons in 37 countries. The name given hastily to the manifestations-severe acute respiratory syndrome-was not especially inventive, or even descriptive of the geographic or other locus of origin. In April 2014 the USA recognized its fi rst case of another acute pulmonary disease, named the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [ 32 ] . The infected individual had recently returned home to Munster, Indiana, from Saudi Arabia. Both SARS and MERS are neosyndromes, as was the acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s. \u2022 Borrelia miyamotoi disease : Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi , is named for Lyme, Connecticut, where a cluster of cases occurred in 1975. Now we have a new disease, caused by a cousin of B. burgdorferi named B. miyamotoi , detected fi rst in Connecticut and subsequently found to be spread by all the same tick species that are the vectors for Lyme disease [ 33 ] . \" Borrelia miyamotoi disease\" is much too cumbersome a title for continued use, and so this new disease is a naming opportunity for someone. \u2022 Philadelphia syndrome : In searching for neosyndromes, I came to the 2013 description of a mystery ailment affecting chiefl y young women in the Philadelphia area, characterized by sudden personality changes, uncontrolled movements, and seizures. Physicians report, \"It is like your brain is on fi re\" [ 34 ] . Will this entity, in time, come to be known as \"Philadelphia syndrome?\"",

Here is another group of literary misadventures, some I consider to be more entertaining than simple obfuscation or misprints. These typically are wrong-headed misstatements and even ill-fated predictions. Wise medical writers keep in mind that what goes into print today may sound ridiculous when read back to you a few decades in the future. Pierre Pachet was Professor of Physiology at Toulouse University in France and highly respected in his day. In 1872, however, he declared [ 39 ] : \"Louis Pasteur's theory of germs is ridiculous fi ction.\" Benjamin Rush, sometimes called the \"American Sydenham,\" was professor of chemistry at the Philadelphia Medical School, later to become the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He wrote America's fi rst chemistry book. Rush was an American patriot who signed the Declaration of Independence and served as Surgeon General of the Continental Army. But in 1796, he declared [ 40 ] : \"I have formerly said there is but one fever in the world. Be not startled, Gentlemen, follow me and I will say there is but one disease in the world. The proximate cause of disease is irregular convulsive \u2026 action in the [vascular] system affected.\" JAMA has an engaging column titled \"JAMA Revisited,\" transcribing verbatim articles published in the distant past. (I would enjoy the column even more if the original authors were identifi ed more often.) My small criticism notwithstanding, I read it regularly and was amused by an article on bicycles, published in the August 15, 1896, issue of JAMA [ 41 ] : \"The esthetics and morality of bicycling do not come within the professional ken of the physician. A costume and posture which make ninety women in a hundred absurd spectacles will not long be popular with the thousands and tens of thousands of that fair sex as today \u2026 It is enough for us to declare that a woman, especially an adolescent girl, can not be suspended on the summit of a wedge without injury to the structures above, and the deformation of the pelvis; and that the bruising of the fl esh, which some riders unwillingly admit, and the craving for stimulants after a fatiguing ride, ought to restrain the prevailing indiscriminate and intemperate use of the vehicle.\"",

These features render a journal trustworthy and worthy of readers' time and money. Many observers were therefore understandably disturbed when the journal publisher Elsevier admitted in 2009 that it had published six 'fake journals' funded by pharmaceutical companies-in Elsevier's own words, 'sponsored article compilation publications \u2026 that were made to look like journals and lacked disclosure.' The company had intentionally exploited the word 'journal' to give the impression that these publications were honest and reliable\" [ 49 ] .",

Williams, I believe, was not saying that a lack of what is found in poetry causes men to die , but rather that their deaths are sometimes unnecessarily miserable for want of the imagery, joy, and even the cadence of poems.

In my opinion, he was writing about the quality of life at the time of dying, and how it can be enhanced by metaphor, simile, allusion, and nuance of language and thought.
