            "text": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system clinically characterized by bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. The peak age of onset of PD is from 40 to 70 years of age. It has been reported that PD patients have a decreased tendency to catch colds [1]. On the contrary, Christopher et al. speculated that there might be an increased risk of developing PD among individuals born following an influenza epidemic [2]. A case-control study evaluating risk factors for PD suggested that the frequency of severe flu-like illness was higher in the PD group than in the controls during the pre-parkinsonian period [3]. Summing up these reports, one may speculate that the PD patients who suffered from a flu-like illness in utero or in childhood may have a reduced tendency to catch cold after the onset of PD. In the present study, we examined the frequency of colds in patients with PD, their spouses and patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). We found that the PD patients did have fewer colds than the persons in the other groups.",

One of the acute phase proteins, MxA, is known to have anti-viral properties against the influenza A virus [5], [6], [7]. We have reported possible links between influenza A virus and PD, namely that a neurovirulent strain of influenza A virus invades the substantia nigra and that MxA exists in the Lewy bodies of neurons in the brains of PD patients [8]. Further study is required on the mechanism of resistance to flu-like illness in PD.",
