            "text": "The sulfonamide or sulfonyl functional groups have been important motifs in medicinal chemistry since the early discovery of sulfonamide containing antibacterial drugs [1]. The applications of sulfonyl or sulfonamide functional groups in medicinal chemistry cannot be ignored, as it constitutes an important class of drugs used extensively as agricultural and pharmaceutical agents [2,3]. The features of SVI-containing species of strong electron withdrawing nature, stability against hydrolysis, resistance to reduction at sulfur, and crisp preference for two-electron processes over radical processes, have already made this group applicable to many productive fields. Sulfonamides as synthetic antifolic agents have been widely used for the anticipation and treat of bacterial infections in biological systems and recently have evoked high favor in biology and medicine due to their wide array of biological activities such as antibacterial [[4], [5], [6]], antifungal [7], anti-inflammatory [[8], [9], [10]], antioxidant [11,12], diuretics [[13], [14], [15]], anticancer [[16], [17], [18], [19]] carbonic anhydrases [[20], [21], [22]], antitumor [[23], [24], [25]], Alzheimer diseases [26,27], antitubercular [28,29], antidiabetic [30,31], HIV protease inhibitors [32,33], antiglaucoma [[34], [35], [36]], antiobesity [37,38], antiviral [39,40], antimalaria [41], MMP inhibitors [42,43], non-peptidic vasopressin receptor antagonists [44] and translation initiation inhibitors [45] etc. Up to date, more than 150 FDA approved drugs bearing Sulfur (SVI) motif are available in the market such as celecoxib, meloxicam, piroxicam, sulfasalazine, and so on [46]. The diverse pharmacological activity of SVI in organic molecules makes it a first choice for incorporation by the hybrid approach, which is present in most of the required medicines that are accessible in the market [47].",

Because of the weak effectiveness and even loss of resistance power of old antibiotics against new and upcoming bacterial pathogens, urgent alternatives were needed to develope novel, less toxic and highly effective antimicrobial agents with distinct structures to fight with emerging antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In the first part of this review article, we have focused on sulfonamide analogues as a core substituent of antibacterial agents for drug development. In this regard, the combinations of sulfonamides and other heterocyclic drug molecules are being used to develop novel antibiotic drugs [54].

Compound 107 (Fig. 2\n) showed excellent antibacterial activity against S. aureus with MIC values of 4 \u03bcg/mL. The replacement of 4-fluorobenzyl group (107) by 2,4-dichlorobenzyl group, 108 (Fig. 2) showed good antibacterial activity against B. typhi with MIC values 4 \u03bcg/mL. Compound 108 showed eight folds higher activity (MIC = 4 \u03bcg/mL) than standard Chloromycin against B. typhi [59]. The above same research group further developed a class of new type of sulphonamide-containing azoles analogues as potential antimicrobial agents. Compound 109 (Fig. 2) showed excellent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with MIC value of 16 \u03bcg/mL [60]. Kamble et al. have reported pyrazole derived sulfonamide analogues as good antibacterial agents. Compound 110 (Fig. 2) showed potent antibacterial activity against tested bacterial strains S. aureus and S. typhimurium with MIC value of 10 \u03bcg/mL each. Compound 111 (Fig. 2) showed excellent antibacterial activity against different bacterial pathogens namely B. subtillis and E. coli with MIC value of 10 \u03bcg/mL each. To elucidate the structure activity relationship (SAR) of compounds 110 and 111, the presence of electron withdrawing (Br and CF3) groups (EWG) on the sulfonyl attached phenyl ring, increases the bacterial resistance against the tested S. aureus and S. typhimurium strains. But the same moiety with replacement of the -Br functional group, and the inserting of the Cl functional group, compound 111 was found to be highly active against another bacterial strains B. subtillis and E. coli. The lipophilicity as well as nature and position of the substituent present on benzene ring of sulfonamide end affected the antimicrobial activity [61]. In 2014, Nasr et al. developed a new type of sulfonamide containing sulfisoxazole analogues and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Compound 112 (Fig. 2) showed promising antibacterial activities against most of the tested bacterial strains. Compound 113 (Fig. 2) showed excellent antibacterial activity against the S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris and K. pneumonia bacterial strains. The analysis of the SAR, revealed that the presence of sulfonamide group with heterocyclic moiety increases the lipophilic characters of the synthesized compounds [62].",

            "text": "The research group of Padmaja [63] synthesized heterocycles containing sulfonamides analogues and evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activities against various microbial pathogens using agar disc diffusion method. Among all the synthesized analogues, isoxazole containing sulfone analog 114 (S. aureus - 32 mm, B. subtilis - 31 mm, K. pneumoniae- 26 mm, P. vulgaris - 28 mm in diameter) (Fig. 3\n) was found to exhibit the highest inhibitory activity against tested bacterial strains. The presence of EWG (Cl) on phenyl ring of the sulfonyl end and sulfone group infatuated stronger antimicrobial activities compared to the other EDGs. In the continuation of the potent antimicrobial drug developments of sulfone containing heterocyclic derivatives, Lavanya et al. [64] reported 1,4-phenylene) bis (arylsulfonylisoxazoles analogues to have potent antimicrobial properties. Compound 115 (Fig. 3) was found to have the highest antibacterial activity against B. subtilis with zone of inhibition of 38 mm at 100 mg/mL. The elucidating of the SAR indicated that the presence of EWG (Cl) on the phenyl ring of the sulfone end showed maximum antibacterial activity against B. subtilis strain. In another study, a 2-ureidothiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivative was synthesized and screened as dual bacterial RNAP and HIV-1 RT inhibitors by Elgaher et al. [65]. Compound 116 (Fig. 3) displayed more potency against tested S. aureus with high cellular antiretroviral activity. This is probably due to the presence of non-bulky hydrophilic substituents at the ureido side chain for RT inhibition, the hydrophilic and hydrogen bond donor or acceptor substituents at the N-phenyl group are also important for increasing the antibacterial activity. Hrast and co-workers developed novel sulfone based cyanothiophene analogues and established their inhibitors of MurF enzymes by using Malachite green assay [66,67]. Compound 117 (Fig. 3) displayed potent MurFsp inhibitory activities against MurFsp enzyme with IC50 0.30 \u03bcM. Compound 118 (Fig. 3) exhibited excellent MurF enzymes activity against two MurFSp and MurFEc with IC50 values of 20 \u03bcM and 25 \u03bcM, respectively. This is probably due to the presence benzylsubstituted derivatives of electron-donating groups (EDGs) to improve the inhibitory activity more than 2\u20133-fold compared with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs).",

            "text": "Novel N-sulfonaminoethyloxime derivatives of dehydroabietic acid were developed by Zhang et al. [68] and tested for antibacterial activity against various bacterial pathogens. Among those, compound 119 (Fig. 4\n) exhibited the superior activity against tested five multidrug-resistances of S. aureus with MIC values between 0.78 and 1.56 \u03bcg/mL. The meta-CF3 phenyl derivative 119 showed the highest activity with MIC of 0.39\u20130.78 \u03bcg/mL against S. aureus Newman. To elucidate the SAR, they demonstrated that the introduce of an electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) at meta position on the phenyl ring is more beneficial for the increasing antibacterial activity and selectivity compared to other substituents such as chloro, bromo, fluoro, methyl or methoxy groups. Very interestingly, the ortho substituted CF3 derivative exhibited no in vitro activity against any of the Gram-positive bacterial strains at 50 \u03bcg/mL. The tert-butyl and methoxy functional group containing analogues showed decreased antibacterial activity. In addition, the substitution position appeared to have slight influence on the antibacterial activity of electron withdrawing functional group substituted derivatives. Nimbarte and co-workers [69] developed novel sulfonamide linked piperidine and pyrazole analogues and evaluated for the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolysis. Compounds 120 and 121 (Fig. 4) showed the highest inhibitory activity against tested bacterial strains with IC50 values of 0.220 \u03bcM and 0.224 \u03bcM, respectively. Zengin and co-workers found a new class of sulfanilamide as potent antimicrobial agents against tested bacterial and fungal strains. Compound 122 (Fig. 4) was found to have the highest antimicrobial activities against B. cereus (MIC value is 33 mm) and E. fecalis (MIC value is 33 mm). The SAR studies revealed that the lipophilicity of the analogues played a crucial role for producing antimicrobial activities. The dimethyl substituted compound 122 had high antimicrobial activity but low lipophilic character [70]. Series of sulfonamide containing benzothiazole hybrids were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial properties against some microbial pathogens. Compounds 123 and 124 (Fig. 4) and were found to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the reference Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim mixture. The SAR studies revealed that the presence of sulfonamides with an amino group (-NH2) and nitro group (-NO2) at the para position of the phenyl ring showed excellent antimicrobial properties. The replacement of the amino group with nitro group led to the decrease of the antibacterial activity [71]. In continuous study of sulphonamide containing benzothiazole analogues as powerful antimicrobial properties, a new class of sulphonamide containing benzothiazole hybrids were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity by Patel et al. Compound 126 (Fig. 4) was found to be antimicrobially active with MIC values in the range of 15.5\u201331.25 \u03bcg/mL. Compounds 125 and 127 (Fig. 4) showed reasonable antimicrobial activity with MIC values in the range of 31.25\u201362.5 \u03bcg/mL. The SAR studies revealed that the presence of strong EWGs such as -F, -Cl, and -NO2 showed superior antimicrobial activities compared to the EDGs [72]. Various sulfonamide based analogues were synthesized and tested for their in vitro antimicrobial agents by Bhusari et al. Among these, compounds 128\u2013130 (Fig. 4) displayed superior antimicrobial agents against the tested microbial pathogens [73]. Subudhi et al. developed a class of novel sulphonamide based analogues and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activities. Compound 131 (Fig. 4) showed superior antimicrobial activity against the S. aureus (zone of inhibition 18 mm), E. faecalis (zone of inhibition 23 mm), E. coli (zone of inhibition 18 mm) and P. aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 17 mm). The preliminary SAR study revealed that the presence of sulfonamide group at para position of the phenyl group has highly increases the antibacterial properties of all the tested bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, the presence of EWG (Cl) group on the phenyl ring also contributes to increasing the antibacterial activity [74].",

Among these, compound 139 (Fig. 6) was found to be excellent PPAR-\u03b3 inhibitor of 61.2% with 1.9 folds increase in gene expression. In docking studies, compound 139 displayed good interaction with amino acids Tyr 473, Ser 289, Hie 449, Tyr 327, Arg 288, Met 329 and Leu 228 (Fig. 7\n).

Compounds 140 and 141 (Fig. 8\n) showed excellent anti-diabetic agents with more than 50% reduction in the rise of blood glucose levels. The SAR may be summarized as the introduction of electron withdrawing Cl at para position of phenyl group caused slightly reduction in the activity. On the other hand, the presence of electron releasing functional groups such as methoxy or methyl functional group at phenyl ring slightly caused reduction in the activity. Moreover, the compounds containing less bulky side chains were found to be more favourable for increasing anti-diabetic activity [82]. The effect of in vivo antidiabetic activity in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus rat model was explored later by Moreno-D\u0131az et al. in which compounds 142 and 143 (Fig. 8) showed promising antidiabetic properties. The SAR revealed that the presence of EDGs (-OMe and \u2013OC2H5) at position 5 of the benzothiazole ring, enhanced the antidiabetic activity [83]. Navarrete-Vazquez et al., in 2009 designed and synthesized a series of new 2-arylsulfonylaminobenzothiazole analogues and screened for protein tyrosine phosphatase-1D inhibitory activity (PTP-1D). Compounds 144 and 145 (Fig. 8) showed the most promising activity against PTP-1D with IC50 value is 19.5 and 40.9 \u03bcM respectively. The SAR revealed that the presence of EWGs (-NO2) on the phenyl ring of sulfonamide end enhanced the anti-diabetic properties [84]. Recently, how to improve the drug resistance of potent anti-diabetic drugs against PTP-1B, has emerged as a key role of insulin signalling target for type 2-diabetes. In 2018, Du and co-workers reported novel PTP-IB inhibitors of a series of ureodo-sulfonamides based analogues. Among these, compounds 146 and 147 (Fig. 8) showed superior PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values of 18.6 nM and 66.2 nM respectively. The SAR suggested that, compound 146 with 2-ethoxy group on B ring was identified to possess 10.9 fold more potent inhibitory activity against the PTP1B enzyme. Compound 147, with the presence of -CONH-(3,4-di-MeO-Ph) group on ring B displayed high potent activity [85].",

Compounds 148, 149, 150 and 151 (Fig. 9\n) displayed promising inhibitory effects with IC50 value 2.348, 2.064, 1.571 and 2.118 \u03bcM, respectively. The SAR implied that the EWGs, -Cl, -F and -Br enhanced, while the EDGs decreased the \u03b1-amylase inhibition activity. In 2017, Wang and co-workers developed novel potential \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors of sulfonamide based chromone hydrazones. Compound 152 (Fig. 9) (IC50 = 20.1 \u00b1 0.19 \u03bcM) bearing a 4-sulfonamide substitution at phenyl part of hydrazide was the most efficient \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Docking results revealed that, compound 152 was interacting with the amino acids residues Glu-276, Asp-214, Asp-349 and Arg-439 through hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions [87]. In a study by Humphries et al. carbazole-containing sulfonamides as assayed for potent cryptochrome modulators of antidiabetic agents. Compound 153 (Fig. 9) showed stronger cryptochrome modulator with EC50 = 0.144 \u03bcM. The SAR suggested that, the presence of sulfonamides functional group improved lipophilic efficiency of the potent analog [88]. Recently, Deka and co-workers have prepared a new series of thiazolidinediones hybrids and screened for potent peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). Among all the synthesized analogues, compounds 154 and 155 (Fig. 9) showed maximum PPAR\u03b3 binding affinities (I\nmax) with 98% and 82% respectively. The SAR revealed that, the introduction of diverse aryl sulfonamides as the polar head group and 1-phenylpiperidine on the tail part highly influenced the PPAR\u03b3 activity. In addition, the presence of electron withdrawing Cl and \u2013CF3 groups on the phenyl ring of the sulfonamide linker also played a major role for the increases of activity. The presence of electron releasing (OH and \u2013OCH3) groups decreased the activity [89].",

Compound 156 (Fig. 10\n) showed the most potent active PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor with EC50 values is 2 nM. The SAR revealed that, the presence of EWGs (F and Br) on phenyl ring A increased the activity. The sulfonamide moiety and a bromine atom at the para position on the aromatic benzene ring A contributed the potent active PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor [90]. Gao and co-workers synthesized a novel series of sulfonamide-1,3,5-triazine-thiazoles derivatives and tested for in vitro inhibitory activity against several DPP enzymes, such as DPP-4, DPP-8 and DPP-9. Compound 157 (Fig. 10) was found to be highly potent against DPP-4 enzyme with IC50 value of 2.32 nM compared to standard drug alogliptin. The SAR suggested that, compounds containing EWGs had superior inhibitory activity compared to those with EDGs substituent. Furthermore, the presence of additional aromaticity did not influence the activity. Moreover, molecular docking results indicated that, ligand 157 was efficiently docked into the active site of the catalytic triad of Ser 630, Asp 708 and His 740 encompassing both S1 and S2 pocket with CDOCKER interaction energy of 57.80 [91]. At last, Iqbal and co-workers have developed arylsulfonylspiroimidazolidine-2,4-dione hybrids as potent hypoglycemic and ALR2 agents. Compound 158 (Fig. 10) was found to have the most potent inhibitory activity against ALR2 with an IC50 value of 0.89 \u03bcM. The in vivo hypoglycaemic activity of compound 158 exhibited 72.24% reduction in blood glucose, which was more potent than standard drug glibenclamide (60.92% reduction). The SAR suggested that, the presence of EWG (Cl) on the phenyl ring highly influenced the ALR2 activity. Replacing the halogen atom by methyl or methoxy group led to a reduced activity which was attributable to the lower lipophilicity of these substituents compared to the chlorine atom, and lesser interaction with the active site of aldose reductase. Activity was not really affected when the 2-naphthyl group replaced the para substituted phenyl ring; however, 2- anthraquinyl group was found to be detrimental to the activity. The large size of the 2-anthraquinyl group might be responsible for this negative effect [92].",

The para-chlorophenyl substituted compound 170 (Fig. 12\n) emerged as a potent anti-inflammatory agent with protection 77.4% exceeding that of indomethacin. Chowdhury and co-workers reported a family of pyrazole bearing sulfonamides analogues and evaluated for in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Compound 171 (Fig. 12) displayed attractive anti-inflammatory activity compared to the standard anti-inflammatory drugs celecoxib and aspirin. SAR studies revealed that the presence of N-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridyl ring significantly increased the bioisosteric effects in the active analogues [107]. Next, the research group of El-Din et al. developed sulfonamides based hybrids with potent anti-inflammatory activity [108]. Compound 172 (Fig. 12) was found to be most significant candidate, no ulcerogenic effect and with minimal effects on renal function. Novel pyrazole based sulfonamides derivatives were prepared by K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckg\u00fczel and co-workers and screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Among those, compound 173 (Fig. 12) showed promising anti-inflammatory activity [109]. In 2013, Ragab et al. prepared and evaluated some novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazoles derivatives with potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Compound 174 (IC50 = 0.22 mmoL/kg) (Fig. 12) showed excellent anti-inflammatory activity (82% inhibition) and promising analgesic activity. The SAR suggested that, compounds containing 4-chlorophenyl pharmacophore exhibited higher activity than other functional substituted analogues (except for benzenesulfonamide azomethine). The effect of the nature of substituent at the 3-position of the pyrazole nucleus also played a major role in enhancing the anti-inflammatory activity [110].",

In addition, molecular docking study revealed that the compound 175 interacted with Tyr 385 and Ser 530 [111]. Hassan et al. synthesized a series of benzofuran bearing celecoxib-sulfonamides for the development of novel anti-inflammatory agents.

Anti-inflammatory data revealed that an essential role of compounds 176 and 177 bearing pyridine moiety enhanced the anti-inflammatory efficiency in animal models [112]. Ahmed and co-workers synthesized a new class of curcumin-containing sulfonamides analogues to investigate the activity against anti-inflammatory. Compound 178 (Fig. 13) was identified as a successful anti-inflammatory agent by 82% inhibition of induced edema which is comparable to standard drug indomethacin (84.4% inhibition) [113]. In 2014, Kumar et al. reported an eighteen pyrazolylpyrazolines bearing benzenesulfonamide as potent anti-inflammatory agents.

Compound bearing sulfonamide analog 196 (Fig. 16\n) with 6,7-dimethoxy groups exhibited the most potent antimalarial activity with IC50 values of 2.8 \u03bcM. The structure activity studies concluded that the lipophilicity of dimethoxyphenyl and tetrahydroisoquinoline sulfonamide may be contributing to enhance the activity [124]. Eleven analogues of sulphonamide bearing chalcones were tested for their effects as inhibitors of \u03b2-hematin formation against cultured P. falciparum parasites by Dom\u00ednguez et al. The substituted trimethoxyl aromatic compound 197 (Fig. 16) was found to be the most active antimalarial agent with IC50 value of 0.48 \u03bcM, compared to a reference antimalarial drug chloroquine with IC50 value of 1.33 \u03bcM [125]. The screening of new N-(7-chloroquinolinyl-4-aminoalkyl)arylsulfonamides analogues were developed by Verma et al. All the synthesized analogues were tested in vitro antimalarial activity against P. falciparum 3D7 and K1 strains. Two compounds 198 (Fig. 16) (IC50 3D7: 0.05 \u03bcM, K1: 0.41 \u03bcM) and 199 (Fig. 16) (IC50 3D7: 0.01 \u03bcM; K1: 0.36 \u03bcM) showed promising antimalarial activity better than the positive control. Results from the study indicated that alkyl chain length was critical for antimalarial activity and also the presence of isopropyl groups on the phenyl ring of the sulfonamide end highly enhanced the antimalarial activity [126]. Recently, Oliveira and co-workers reported the potent sulfonamide containing chaclcone hybrids and evaluated for in vitro anti-malarial activity against P. falciparum. Compound 200 (IC50 = 2.06 \u03bcM) (Fig. 16) was found to be the best antimalarial agent with good selectivity index [127]. Muthas and co-workers reported a class of new potent hydroxyethypiperazines bearing benzenesulfonyl hybrids as antimalarial agents. All the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro antimalarial activity against a W2 P. falciparum clone.

            "text": "Recently, the combination of indoleamides with sulfonyl has been reported as the most active antimalarial agents against Pf3D7 and PfK1 strains. Among those, compounds 202, 203, 204 and 205 (Fig. 17\n) with sulfonyl pharmacophore showed promising activity with IC50 of 1.87, 1.93, 2.00, 2.17 \u03bcM against CQ sensitive Pf3D7 strain and 1.69, 2.12, 1.60, 2.19 \u03bcM against CQ resistant PfK1 strain, respectively. SAR revealed that the presence of sulfonyl analogues containing bulky groups such as p-ter-butylphenyl (202 and 204) and 4-chloro-2,5-dimethyl phenyl groups (203 and 205) showed the most promising antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values range between 1.60 and 2.19 \u03bcM [129]. Huang and co-workers reported sulphonamide bearing small analogues as potent dual inhibitors of FP-2 and DHFR. Compounds 206 and 207 (Fig. 17) bearing amide and sulphonamide moieties were found to be the most active FP-2 inhibitors. Compound 207 containing thiazole group on amide moiety was most active analogues against FP-2 (IC50 = 7.0 \u03bcM) and DHFR (IC50 = 6.3 \u03bcM). In addition, compound 207 showed reasonable in vivo antimalarial activities compared to standard drug chloroquine diphosphate salt. SAR suggested that the presence of amide, sulphonamide and thiazole groups played a crucial role for enhancing the antimalarial activity [130]. Caridha and co-workers reported potent thiophene and benzene sulfonamides as antimalarial agents. Among these, bromohydrosulfonylacetamides 208 (Fig. 17) was found to be promising growth inhibition of drug resistant P. falciparum W2 strain as well as low toxicity profiles against mammalian cell lines. Further exploration of 208 with variation in the thiophene and benzene ring substitutions may produce more potent PfCDK inhibitors [131]. Cunico and co-workers have developed hydroxyethylpiperazine analogues and evaluated in vitro anti-malarial agents against a W2 Plasmodium falciparum clone. Compound 209 was found to be the most potent anti-malarial agent with IC50 value of 4.8 \u03bcM against W2 Plasmodium falciparum clone almost as active as standard lopinavir. The SAR revealed that the presence of amine group on the phenyl ring influenced the anti-malarial activity. In addition, the presence of piperazine moiety was also an essential for increases the activity. The sulfonamide functional groups were bridged between the two bioactive analogues [132].",

According to the present estimation, about 45 million people are going through this disease worldwidely and it may reach up to 131 million by 2050 as per the documentation if left untreated [[133], [134], [135]]. Actual etiology for the AD progression is not known yet but a number of pathophysiology factors are believed to be responsible for the progression of this disease. Deficits of acetylcholine (Ach), inflammation, \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposits, oxidative stress, dyshomeostasis of biometals, tau-protein aggregation are considered to be such pathophysiological factors [[136], [137], [138]]. Unfortunately the medicines for the cure of AD and its progression are not discovered yet. But certain medicines are approved and prescribed for the AD patients for the temporary relief [139,140]. In this part of the review article, sulfonamide nucleus is focused as a core substituent of Alzheimers agents for the development of drug [[141], [142], [143], [144]].

            "text": "Mutahir and co-workers performed novel biphenyl bis-sulfonamide derivatives as potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) agents. Among the tested compounds, compound 217 (Fig. 19\n) was found to be the most potent activity against AChE (IC50 2.27 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM), whereas 218 (Fig. 19) exhibited the highest inhibition for BChE (IC50 7.74 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcM). SAR studies revealed that both the 3,30-dimethylbiphenyl functionality as well as benzyl moiety on nitrogens played a crucial role for the higher activity of compound 217. The higher activity of 218, bearing n-hexadecanyl moiety on nitrogens, is a similar trend as the case in AChE inhibition which could be attributed to the hydrophobic bulkiness of the n-hexadecanyl group. In addition, molecular docking studies were also performed for the analysis of the binding mode and hydrogen bonding interactions of compound 217 in both cholinesterases enzymes. Ligand binding within the active site of AChE was limited to hydrophobic interactions with Tyr334, Phe331, and Phe330 from anionic sub-site, Tyr70 from acyl pocket as well as Tyr121, Trp279, Asp276 and Phe228 from peripheral anionic site. Biphenyl fragment was engaged in more specific \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 and CH\u2013\u03c0 interactions with Tyr334. The arrangement of the most active compound 217 in the active gorge of AChE is shown in Fig. 20\n. Ligand binding within the active site of AChE was limited to hydrophobic interactions with Trp84, Phe330, and Phe331 from anionic sub-site, Phe290 from acyl pocket as well as Tyr121, Trp279 and Tyr334 from peripheral anionic site (PAS). Biphenyl fragment was engaged in more specific \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 and CH-\u03c0 interactions with Trp279, Phe331 and Tyr334. Oxygen atoms in sulfonamide groups might create weak H-bonds with hydroxyl group of Tyr70 or unionized form of Asp72. The arrangement of the most active compound 217 in the active gorge of AChE is shown in Fig. 21\n. And similar results were observed in case of docking to the active site of BChE. The binding of the tested compound 217 with AChE and BChE was mainly provided due to the presence of hydrophobic interactions. Summing up, it can be assumed that the binding of the tested compounds with AChE and BChE was mainly provided due to the presence of hydrophobic interactions. However, the obtained compounds are interesting starting point for their further development and synthesis of potent cholinesterase inhibitors. Structural modifications leading to increase of number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors should augment the strength and specificity of binding to enzymes [145]. Yar et al. reported the novel potent pyridine 2,4,6-tricarbohydrazide analogues as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) agents. Compound 219 (Fig. 19) exhibited the most potent activity against tested enzymes such as AChE (IC50 50.2 \u03bcM) and BChE (IC50 43.8 \u03bcM). Overall the compound 219 bearing phenyl group was found to be active against all these tested enzymes [146]. On the other hand, Ulus et al. described acridine-sulfonamide hybrids as potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Compound 220 (Fig. 19) displayed superior activity against AChE with an IC50 of 0.14 \u03bcM [147]. Later, the same research group (Ulus et al.) continued the development of new type of alzheimer's agents in which, sulfonamid bearing tacrine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities. Compound 221 (Fig. 19) was found to have the highest inhibitory activity on AChE with IC50 value of 0.009 \u03bcM. This value is 220-fold higher than that of galantamine (IC50 = 2.054 \u03bcM). Compound 222 (Fig. 19) displayed the strongest inhibition of BuChE with IC50 value of 2.250 \u03bcM. To elucidate SAR, sulfonamide group present on the para position at the phenyl ring showed good acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE IC50 = 0.009 \u03bcM). When sulfonamide group moved from para to meta-position of phenyl ring the butyrylcholinesterase activity was increased [148]. Rehman et al. also evaluated the ability of some pyrimidine-based sulfonamides against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes. They designed and tested compound 223 (Fig. 19) as a potent agent with IC50 values of AChE 3.73 \u03bcM and BChE 4.81 \u03bcM. SAR studies suggested that the presence of electron releasing moiety was crucial for the higher activity of 223 and EWGs inactive against the AChE and BChE enzymes. At the next level of investigation, the authors also performed the molecular docking analysis of potent compound 223 for detailed exploration of its binding pattern within the active sites of AChE and BChE. In addition, docking technique is considered efficient in accurately predicting binding mode of small molecules. The most potent compound 223 was showed detailed exploration of its binding pattern (2D and 3D binding mode of interaction) within the active sites of AChE and BChE. Compound 223 had two hydrogen-bond interactions with the peripheral anionic site residue Tyr279 upon binding to AChE (Fig. 22\n). Additionally, the docked complex of BChE with 223 showed that the hydrophobic patch residue Tyr332 and the catalytic triad residue Gly116 were involved in intra molecular hydrogen bonding (Fig. 23\n). The docking results showed that 223 were capable of establishing two hydrogen-bond interactions with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) residue Tyr121 upon binding to AChE (Fig. 24\n). Additionally, the docked complex of BChE with 6j (BChE-6j) showed that the hydrophobic patch residue Tyr128 and the catalytic triad residue Ser198 were involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding (Fig. 25\n) [149].",

The most potent hBChE inhibitor of the series, compound 224 (Fig. 26\n) (IC50 = 127 nM) is 1,3 disubstituted piperidine with a sulphonamide group and (CH2)2OMe chain on the sulfonamide nitrogen. SAR revealed that the absence of the N-alkyl chain on the carboxamide and sulfonamide nitrogen was imperative for MAO-B inhibition, as compounds bearing the N-alkyl chain were inactive [150]. Since 2013, Park et al. has reported the generation of sulfonamide chalcones analogues as potent \u03b2-secretase and acylcholinesterase inhibitors. Compounds 225 (IC50 = 0.21 \u03bcM), 226 (IC50 = 0.62 \u03bcM) and 227 (IC50 = 0.69 \u03bcM) (Fig. 26) showed most potent BACE1 inhibitor. To elucidate the SAR, the presence of 3,4-dihydroxy group in the B ring of the chalcone, produced more potent agent than the corresponding 4-hydroxy derivatives. Smaller electron donating groups (CH3, OH and NH2) were more favoured than larger species such as OCH3 and EWGs such as NO2 [151]. Recently, Wieckowska et al. reported the sulfonamide based piperidine hybrids as potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonist with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Among these, compound 228 (Fig. 26) was found to be the most potent agent against the 5-HT6 receptor (Kb = 27 nM), AChE and BuChE (hAChE: IC50 = 12 nM, hBuChE: IC50 = 29 nM). In a further drug development program, a novel class of multi-functional ligands were evaluated, in which compound 229 (Fig. 26) the best derivative from the series, represented an excellent starting point for the development of an effective treatment for AD [152].",

L. braziliensis has caused both cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in several Latin American countries [153]. Presently this parasitic disease causes morbidity and mortality, mainly in the developing world [154]. Toxicity, high costs and development of drug resistance have become obstacles in the prevailing chemotherapic treatment [155]. Sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam\u00ae) and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime\u00ae), the two pentavalent antimonial [Sb(V)] compounds, were first introduced in the 1940s and are being used for all forms of leishmaniasis through parenteral administration [156]. Therefore, drugs that are safe, inexpensive and easily available need to be developed immediately. Lead compounds are also now having taken important roles for the future treatment of this disease globally.",

Compounds 230 (IC50 = 0.059 \u03bcM against L. infantum, IC50 = 0.070 \u03bcM against L. amazonensis) and 231 (IC50 = 0.065 \u03bcM against L. infantum, IC50 = 0.072 \u03bcM against L. amazonensis) (Fig. 27\n) showed most potent activity against the tested L. infantum and L. amazonensis strains. In this case, both compounds 230 and 231 pyrazole baring sulfonamide groups were active for treating infections caused by these two Leishmania strains [164]. Borges and co-workers reported a new class of pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamide hybrids as potent antileishmanially active candidates against Leishmania amazonensis. Among these, compound 232 (IC50 value is 6.7 \u03bcM) (Fig. 27) was found to have the most potent activity against Leishmania amazonensis with IC50 value higher than reference drug ketoconazole [165]. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosende et al. developed a new series of naphthalene-sulfonamide analogues as potent antileishmanial and trypanocidal inhibitors. Compound 233 (Fig. 27) displayed most potent inhibition on three Leishmania species entitled L. infantum (IC50 = 23.0 \u03bcM), L. amazonensis (IC50 = 42.9 \u03bcM) and T. cruzi (IC50 = 223.7 \u03bcM). In addition, compound 233 was found to be an excellent anti-T. cruzi candidate, and further clinical investigation could be useful in the development of new antichagasic drugs [166]. The group of Palop reported diselenide containing sulfonamide derivatives, which exhibited in vitro leishmanicidal activities against Leishmania infantum intracellular amastigotes and THP-1 cells. Compound 234 (Fig. 27) emerged as the most active compound (IC50 = 2.8 \u03bcM), showing higher activity and much less toxicity against THP-1 cells than reference drug edelfosine. SAR studies, no clear-cut relationship was found but, mutually these results suggested that the sulfonamide scaffold could be a valuable linker for the connection of parent diselenide and para-fluoro phenyl ring attaching both sulfonamide ends [167]. In addition, Rodrigues et al. designed and developed chalcone-sulfonamised analogues as potent antileishmanial agents. Compound 235 (Fig. 27) was found to be the best profile against L. braziliensis promastigotes with IC50 value of 3.5 \u03bcM. Moreover, the presence of benzylamino group extensively contributed to this activity. These results revealed the sulfonamide based methoxychalcone hybrids as lead compounds for designing new candidates for leishmaniasis treatment [168].",

This disease is a threat to the human life affecting lungs primarily (pulmonary TB) apart from other vital organs. Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and totally drug resistant TB (TDR) are emerging now a day's which are completely resistant for the action of presently available standard drugs [169]. The infection of TB is so high that it has caused deaths of around 1.4 million and 10.4 million clinical cases all over globe as reported in 2015 [170,171]. However the treatment of TB with the drugs such as Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol (EMB0), Rifampicin (RIF) and Pyrazinamide (PZA) is observed to be highly effective for TB. Discovery of Rifampicin (RIF) have helped in obtaining handful of Anti-TB drug compounds to the humans. However, still a number of derivatives are to be explored to stop the activity of bacteria and further spreading of TB.

            "text": "Shahul and co-workers reported aminoperidines with benzimidazole derivatives as potent anti-TB agents against Mtb and Mtb DNA gyrase. Compound 241 (Fig. 29\n) displayed superior anti-tuberculosis activities against Mtb and (MIC = 0.19 \u03bcM) Mtb DNA gyrase (IC50 = 1.9 \u03bcM). The SAR revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing (CF3) substituent at 5-position of benzimidazole ring was crucial for producing potent Mtb and introduction of other hydrophobic substituents such as methyl or fluorine enhanced the antiTB potency by 4-fold [172]. Another new class of sulfonyl containing benzimidazole derivatives were evaluated for in vitro anti-TB activity against M. fortuitum, Mtb H37Rv, MDR-TB and M. smegmatis strains by Ranjith et al. The compounds 242\u2013244 (Fig. 29) showed an excellent activity against Mtb H37Rv strain with the MIC of 6.25 \u03bcg/mL. This may be due to the presence of sulfonyl group and bromine at 5 or 6-position of central benzimidazole as the key factor for the improving the activity [173]. A set of new 3-(4-(phenylsulfonyl) cyclohexyl)benzo[d]isoxazole hybrids 245 (Fig. 29) were designed and tested for their anti-TB against M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain by Naidu et al. in which compound 245 with benzenosulfonyl moiety inhibited growth of 99% bacteria at 3.125 \u03bcg/mL [174]. MTB Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase B (MptpB), a familiar protein tyrosine phosphatase determined by Mtb, is a promising target for new anti-TB agents. Yao et al. has screened around 3500 compounds as MptpB inhibitor, and some of them displayed potent activities which are exemplified by 246 (Fig. 29) with IC50 of 0.15 \u03bcM. Thus, both of them could act as leads to be further exploited [175]. Several sulfonyl-hydrazones were also tested for in vitro anti-TB agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis-PtpB. Among all the synthesized molecules, compounds 247 (IC50 = 18 \u03bcM), 248 (IC50 = 21 \u03bcM), 249 (IC50 = 39 \u03bcM) and 250 (IC50 = 41 \u03bcM) (Fig. 24) showed the most potent PtpB inhibitors. The SAR suggested that the presence of EWGs (Cl, F and NO2) on the phenyl ring of sulfonamide end enhanced the anti-TB properties [176]. As the continuous search of new type of potent anti-TB agents, Reddy and co-workers designed and developed new sulfonamide based indole hybrids as potent anti-TB agents. Compound 251 (Fig. 29) was found to be the most active anti-TB agents with IC50 = 17.02 \u03bcM. The SAR study revealed that (i) N-mesyl indoles showed better activities compared to N-tosyl analogues and (ii) the presence of EDGs at C-5 position of the indole ring was favourable for chorismate mutase (CM) inhibition [177]. Compound 252 (Fig. 29) displayed promising anti-TB activity with 45% inhibition at 30 \u03bcM. In silico study suggested that the carbonyl oxygen of 252 participated in H-bond interactions with CM [178]. Nakhi et al. explored potent anti-TB agents against MtbCM. Compound 253 (Ki = 5.7 \u03bcM) (Fig. 29) was found to be the best inhibitor against MtbCM. The SAR showed that the indole containing an o-(RSO2NH)C6H4 group at C-2 position and a sulfonamide moiety played a key role during its interaction with the active site of CM [179]. At last, novel 4-aryl/alkylsulfonylmethylcoumarins hybrids were synthesized and screened for in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity against MTBH37Rv. Among these, compound 254 (Fig. 29) showed excellent anti-TB activity with MIC value of 0.78 \u03bcg/mL, eight fold more potent than EMB (MIC: 1.56 \u03bcg/mL) and PZA (MIC: 6.25 \u03bcg/mL) [180].",

The SAR suggested that the presence of size of the halogen and aromatic rings seemed to be significant for the antiretroviral activity against HIV-1 vector and wild-type NL4.3 HIV-1 [185]. Ali et al. designed and developed new potent antiviral agents of potent phenyloxazolidinones hybrids against wild-type HIV-1 protease and MDR variant. Among them, compound 263 (Fig. 31) was found to have excellent antiviral properties with Ki values of 0.003 nM against wt and 2.45 nM against MDR variant [186]. Manfroni and co-workers synthesized a new class of potent pyrazolobenzothiazines hybrids as antiviral activity against HCV. Compounds 264 (EC50 = 8.1 \u03bcM and CC50 = >224 \u03bcM), 265 (EC50 = 4.8 \u03bcM and CC50 = >186 \u03bcM) (Fig. 31) were identified as successful anti-HCV agents [187]. Kang et al. designed and synthesized thiophene-pyrimidine analogues and evaluated their activity against a panel of mutant HIV-1 strains. All the analogues were found to exhibit reasonable to outstanding potency against wild-type (WT) HIV-1 in MT-4 cells.

These results are expected to be helpful in the design of thiophenepyrimidine-based NNRTIs with more potent activity against HIV strains with RT mutations [188]. Zhang et al. explored pyridine-sulfonamides as potent Hepatitis C (HCV) NS4B inhibitor. Compound 267 (Fig. 31) has showed outstanding potency against the HCV 1b replicon, with an EC50 = 2 nM and a selectivity index of >5000 with respect to cellular GAPDH.

Compounds 268 (42%) and 269 (42%) (Fig. 32\n) showed promising TMV inhibition compared to the reference drug Ningnanmycin (54%). The SAR, structural modification in the sulfonamide moiety has a wide impact on anti-viral activity of the compounds [190]. Hu et al. developed and prepared a new class of chalcone-containing purines and benzenesulfonamide hybrids and tested for antiviral properties against TMV and CMV. Compound 270 (Fig. 32) was found to possess outstanding activity against TMV with the EC50 value of 51.65 \u03bcg/mL, which was better than that of ribavirin (150.45 \u03bcg/mL). The SAR analysis showed that introducing EDGs at the 2-position of benzenesulfonamide aromatic rings and low steric hindrance group promoted antiviral properties. These findings indicated that chalcone derivatives were worthy of further research and development as templates for new antiviral agents [191]. Compound 271 (Fig. 32) was found to have potent (Ki = 0.8 nM, IC50 = 1.5 \u03bcM) antiviral activity. Oral bioavailability of this compound ranged from 42% (rat) to 77% (dog) with t1/2 = 6 h [192,193]. Saturation of the 5,6-double bond in the pyrone ring led to the identification of a compound 272 (Fig. 32) with excellent binding affinity for the HIV protease (Ki values in the 0.05 nM) and excellent antiviral activity in cell culture, with significantly less ED50 value of 0.95 \u03bcM [194]. At last, the continuation of finding new class of potent coumarin-benzimidazole hybrids as potent anti-HCV activity by Hwu et al. Among these, compounds 273 (EC50 = 10.2 \u03bcM) and 274 (EC50 = 13 \u03bcM) (Fig. 32) displayed excellent antiviral activity against chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The SAR revealed that the extension of the doubly conjugated uracilecoumarins to triply conjugated uracilecoumarinearenes by use of the -SO2 linker was fundamental to their anti-CHIKV activity. Bezouracil derivatives 273 (Fig. 32) had better selectivity indexes compared to uracil 274 (Fig. 32) or thymine [195].",

In addition to this finding of new sulfonamides containing cannabinoid receptor drugs, scientists from AstraZeneca have also reported a potent sulphonamide based drug 287 (Fig. 34) acts as both CB1/CB2 dual agonists for the administration of pain [214]. Very recently, Watson and co-workers from Pfizer have reported sulfonylbenzimidazole hybrids (288 and 289) (Fig. 34) as selective CB2 agonists and as potential analgesic agents devoid of the side effects associated with CB1 agonists [215]. In 2012, Verbist and co-workers identified sulfonylbenzimidazole analogue 290 (Fig. 34) as potent CB2-receptor agonists. The compound 290 was found to have no analgesic effect which was demonstrated in pain models. Furthermore, to improve the metabolic stability and solubility, the same group optimized the compound 290 and led to the discovery of relatively polar and peripherally acting CB2 agonists of compounds 291 and 292 (Fig. 34) [216]. Greig et al. designed and produced a new class of indole sulfonamides as potent cannabinoid receptor. Compounds 293 and 294 (Fig. 34) displayed outstanding potencies of 4 and 3 nM respectively, and showed good oral exposure and CNS penetration, making them highly versatile tools for investigating the therapeutic potential of allosteric modulation of the cannabinoid system [217]. The presence of sulfonamides functionalities has proved to be an extremely potent agonists at the hCB2 receptor, compound 295 (EC50 = 5.1 nM) and 296 (EC50 = 7.0 nM) (Fig. 34) being the most potent hCB2 receptor agents. These results inspired further development of in vitro profiling of sulfonamides on the hCB1 receptor and on rat liver microsomes (RLM) [218]. Chang et al. developed pyrazole bearing sulfonamide hybrids and evaluated for potent cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist. Compound 297 (Fig. 34) was found to be most potent cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist with Ki values of 0.3 nM (hCB1R), 21.0 nM (hCB2R) and EC50 of 3 nM (CB1R). Compound 297 is currently under development for treating obesity and the related metabolic syndrome [219].",

The SAR studies revealed that the presence of EWGs (NO2) on the phenyl ring and two sulfonyl groups in the analogues increased the anticancer activity [230]. In addition, the search of novel class of potent sulfonamides bearing hybrids, Ibrahim and co-workers reported isatin-pyrazole benzenesulfonamide derivatives as potent CA inhibitors. Compounds 305 and 306 (Fig. 36) showed good carbonic anhydrases inhibition to the cell lines hCA IX (Ki = 15.7 and 7.4 nM, respectively) and hCA XII (Ki = 3.7 and 5.4 nM, respectively). The SAR studies suggested that the presence of EWGs (NO2) on the phenyl ring to increased the activity and sulphonamide played a major role in the enhancing the CA activity [231]. In 2014, Tiangong and co-workers developed compound (307 and 308) (Fig. 36), a new class of styrylsulfonyl-methylpyridines hybrids with the anticancer activity against A2780, MCF7 and HCT-116 cell lines by using MTT assay. Compound 307 was found to have the best antitumor activity in a xenograft HCT-116 colon cancer model with GI50 value of 0.570 \u03bcmoL/L. Compound 308 displayed potent antitumor efficacy in the xenograft A2780 with GI50 value of 0.007 \u03bcmoL/L.

R. Pingaew et al. [124] reported a new class of sulfonyl containing thiosemicarbazone and tetrahydroisoquinoline hybrids as potent anticancer agents. Some of the synthesized thiosemicarbazone analogues showed good cytotoxic potency against MOLT-3 cell lines with IC50 value of 2.13 \u03bcg/mL.

Compound 312 displayed partial agonistic property in cAMP functional assay with pKi value 6.96 in HEK-293 F cell line. Further in vivo studies indicated that compound 312 effectively improved recognition memory by combined modulation of cholinergic as well as glutamatergic neurotransmission in rats [235]. Hayat et al. found that the benzothiazole-sulfonamide hybrids displayed powerful 5-HT6 receptor antagonists against HeLa cell line. Compounds 313 (IC50 = 14 \u03bcM) and 314 (IC50 = 3.9 \u03bcM) (Fig. 37) bearing 4-isopropylphenyl and 1-naphthylsulfonamide group at C-6 position of benzothiazole ring, respectively, showed promising inhibition of 5-HT6 receptor antagonists against HeLa cell line [236]. Prio et al. patented various N-phenyl-2,3-dihydroimidazol [2,1-b]thiazole-5-sulfonamide derivatives as 5-HT6 receptor ligands. Numerous substitution on phenyl as well as imidazole ring provided suitable ligands and some of them displayed excellent affinity for 5-HT6 receptor. Particularly compounds 315, 316 and 317 (Fig. 37) showed good Ki value of 8.4, 16.9 and 5.4 nM, respectively [237]. At last, Liu et al. explored a number of sulphonamide based benzothiazole hybrids as 5-HT6 receptor agents. All the produced hybrids possessed nanomolar range affinity for 5-HT6 receptor. Among them, compound 318 (Fig. 37) was found to be the best potent 5-HT6 receptor with Ki value of 500 nM. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies of this compound 318 (Fig. 37) may provide promising leads in future [238].",

The pharmacokinetics (PK) study demonstrated that compounds 319 and 320 (Fig. 38\n) had realistic drug exposure via po administration and would be suitable for in vivo proof of concept animal studies for a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological actions of this enzyme [239]. Very recently, Iqbal and co-workers found the sulfonamide bearing sultams analogues as potent alkaline phosphatase (bTNAP and bIAP) inhibitors. Among these, compound 321 (Fig. 38) containing a p-nitro substituent was found to be the best active inhibitor with IC50 value of 0.11 \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcM. This examination highlighted the significance of the presence of EWGs on the para position of phenyl ring for effective bTNAP inhibition. The presence of NO2 on the para position of phenyl ring 321 was found to be very efficient and selective inhibitor of bTNAP over bIAP. Moreover, the homology built models were then used for the docking studies in order to rationalize the most probable binding interactions of inhibitors with the enzyme. Compound 321 was the most active bTNAP inhibitor, the sulfonamide group found to be oriented towards the Zn2+ metal ions. Fig. 39\ndisplayed the detailed binding site interactions of most active bTNAP inhibitor of compound 321. Compound 321 was the only compound in which not the sulfonamide group, but the oxygen atom of the p-nitro group was in direct contact (2.1 \u00c5) with the Zn2+ ion of the active site, since 321 is the most active bTNAP inhibitor, this interaction might be responsible for exceptional inhibitory activity observed for this compound. The presence of a sulfonamide group, as a zinc binding function, is suggested to be the most prominent structural feature in the design of potent AP inhibitors [240].",

Compound 323 (IC50 = 14.55 \u00b1 0.30 \u03bcM) (Fig. 40) which only lacked the chloro at 5-position, was observed to be seven-fold decline in the activity. Another compounds 324 (Fig. 40) lacked chloro at position 4 was perceived to be nine times decline in the activity. The SAR revealed that the decrease of chloro substitution from tri- to di- substituted decreased the activity. It is worth displaying in that the synthesized hybrids of biologically active analogues such as oxadiazole ring, sulfone group, hydrazide moiety and aryl rings cordially played their role in exhibiting the activity. Compound 322 was identified as a lead compound for bglucuronidase inhibitory activity and may be used for further research for finding a powerful inhibitor [241]. Very recently, Iqbal and co-workers developed a class of chalcone-sulfonamide hybrids as potent alkaline phosphatase inhibitors. Among them, compounds 325 and 326 (Fig. 40) showed maximum inhibition of human and rat e5\u02b9NT with IC50 values of 0.26 and r5\u02b9NT with 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively. The SAR studies suggested that the presence of EDGs at meta position of phenyl ring displayed greater inhibition. Likewise, the presence of di-substituted bulky electron donating group i.e., methoxy group at 3/4 position showed greater inhibition of \u223c161 fold higher than that of the standard compound sulfamic acid. The most potent inhibitor of 325 and 326 were analyzed in the active pocket of enzyme where its docking poses elaborate the presence of five strong hydrogen bonds with various amino acid residues. Compound 4e also showed strong electrostatic interactions. The two zinc ions within active pocket of h-e5\u02b9NT showed interaction with nitrogen of sulfonamide moiety by forming a metal acceptor phenomenon [242]. In 1997, the FDA approved compound Delavirdine (327) (Fig. 40) was found to be the second NNRTI agent authorized for treatment of HIV-1 [243]. Further, crystallographic analysis confirmed that methyl-sulfonamide group at indole ring was essential for enhancing the activity [244].",

            "text": "With the aim at further investigating the diverse chemical space, the introduction of imidazopyridine ring as a scaffold led to the discovery of two novel series of imidazopyridinylthioacetanilides hybrids. Among these, compounds 330 and 331 (EC50 = 0.75 \u03bcM and 0.21 \u03bcM, respectively) (Fig. 44\n) were identified as the most potent inhibitors in suppressing HIV-1 replication. These compounds 330 and 331 (Fig. 44) had higher anti-HIV-1 potency compared to reference drug dideoxycytidine [247]. Later, Kim et al. designed and developed sulfonamide containing hydroxylated chalcones 332 and 333 (Fig. 44) with potential inhibition of trans-sialidase enzyme which was demonstrated by IC50 values 0.9 and 2.5 \u03bcM [248]. In continuous search of potential sulfonamide based chalcone hybrids as potent drugs against some diseases causing pathogens, in 2010, El-Ayache [249] reported polyphenol bearing two polyphenolic moieties separated by a bis-arylsulfonamide 334 (Fig. 44) or sulfonimide 335 (Fig. 44) which showed potent PAI-1 inhibitory activity. Compound 334 (IC50 = 0.284 \u03bcM) and 335 (IC50 = 0.594 \u03bcM) showed the most potent PAI-1 inhibitory activity. Compound 336 (Fig. 44) was developed by Lahue et al. as potent and selective inhibitors of Eg5 (IC50 = 7.4 \u03bcM). The SAR revealed that the presence of 1-benzylic moiety was essential for the activity and the substitution at the benzylic methylene was detrimental to the inhibitory activity. Also, the presence of ortho substituent on the aromatic ring of the benzyl group especially trifluoromethyl group enhanced the Eg5 inhibitory activity [250]. Finally, Prachayasittikul and co-workers found triazoles derived sulfonamide analogues as potent aromatase inhibitory activity. Compound 337 (Fig. 44) bearing 6,7-dimethoxy substituents on the isoquinoline ring showed the most potent aromatase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.2 \u03bcM) without affecting normal cell. The SAR suggested that the lipophilic effect of dimethoxy groups enhanced the activity of compound 337. In addition, molecular docking studies were performed the most active compound 337 and mode of binding interaction of compound 337 was revealed that, the investigated triazoles could closely engage the active site of aromatase through the interactions of hydrophobic, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and H-bonding. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions with Arg115 were observed 2D-ligand protein interaction (Fig. 45\n). The compound 337 was arranged in such a way to appropriately form hydrogen bonding of the sulfonyl group with the amino group of Ala306 and Ala307 as well as hydrogen bonding of oxycoumarinyl moiety with Ser119. These hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions were suggested to play pertinent roles contributing to the most potent activity of compound 337. Interestingly, isomeric coumarinyl and naphthalenyl triazoles play crucial roles in exerting more potent aromatase inhibitory activity than other tested compounds. This could be attributed to their binding interactions with the aromatase enzyme. The molecular requirements for the most potent triazole inhibitor 337 which contains 6,7-dimethoxy groups, 7-coumaryloxymethyl at position 4 of the triazole ring, and m-substitution of triazole and sulfonyl moieties on the phenyl ring. Such structural features were essential for engaging in hydrophobic, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and H-bonding interactions with the aromatase enzyme, particularly, hydrogen bond forming with Arg115 and Ser119 [251].",

As described above, sulfonamide based hybrids have huge range of biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial, anti-tubercular, antiviral, Alzheimer's activity, anti-convulsant, anti-cancer, anti-tubercular and other activities. Theoretically, sulfonyl or sulphonamide (SVI moieties) based drugs possess the immense potential therapeutic values on diversity of drug targets. The SAR based work will probably continue to play an important role to further optimize the full potential of sulfonamide hybrids. Many of these potential drugs are not yet in clinical trials, but emphasize the exigency in the need for their further derivatization to provide an opportunity for managing therapeutic values more efficiently and with greater efficacy in the future. In addition, these biological agents with promising activity and well-defined mechanisms of action can be considered valuable candidates as prototypes in the design and development of novel and more effective synthetic compounds based potent inhibitors.",
