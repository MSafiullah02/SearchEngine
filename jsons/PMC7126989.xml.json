            "text": "Numerous physiological and biochemical processes in the human body may produce oxygen-centered free radicals and other reactive oxygen species as byproducts. Overproduction of such free radicals can cause oxidative damage to biomolecules (e.g. lipids, proteins, DNA), eventually leading to many chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, aging, and other degenerative diseases in humans Halliwell, 1994, Niki, 1997, Poulson et al., 1998. Plants (fruits, vegetables, medicinal herbs, etc.) may contain a wide variety of free radical scavenging molecules, such as phenolic compounds (e.g. phenolic acids, flavonoids, quinones, coumarins, lignans, stilbenes, tannins), nitrogen compounds (alkaloids, amines, betalains), vitamins, terpenoids (including carotenoids), and some other endogenous metabolites, which are rich in antioxidant activity Larson, 1988, Shahidi and Naczk, 1995, Cotelle et al., 1996, Velioglu et al., 1998, Zheng and Wang, 2001, Cai et al., 2003. Epidemiological studies have shown that many of these antioxidant compounds possess anti-inflammatory, antiatherosclerotic, antitumor, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial, or antiviral activities to a greater or lesser extent Halliwell, 1994, Mitscher et al., 1996, Owen et al., 2000, Sala et al., 2002. The intake of natural antioxidants has been associated with reduced risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other diseases associated with ageing, but there is still considerable controversy in this area Hertog et al., 1995, Kuo, 1997, Mclarty, 1997, Yang et al., 2001, Sun et al., 2002.",

During the 1960s the National Cancer Institute (USA) began to screen plant extracts with antitumor activity (Monks et al., 2002). Natural compounds isolated from medicinal plants, as rich sources of novel anticancer drugs, have been of increasing interest since then. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for pharmaceutical and dietary therapy for several millennia. The earliest medical monograph of China now extant, Yellow Emperor\u2019s Canon of Medicine which was compiled around 475\u2013221 B.C., used a term meaning \u201ctumor\u201d (Xu et al., 2000). Formal documentation of \u201ccancer\u201d appeared in the 12th century A.D. Chinese medicine has its own traditional theory of prevention and treatment of diseases including cancer with prescriptions containing several medicinal herbs, seldom with a single medicinal herb. A number of anticancer Chinese medicinal herbs and many relevant prescriptions have been screened and used for treating and preventing various cancers during long-term folk practice. Nowadays therapies with anticancer medicinal plants are still widely practised particularly in the countryside and remote mountainous regions, and even in the major cities of China.",

Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history, but it has been mainly practiced through clinical treatment and its chemical and pharmacological bases are not well understood in most cases. Because of rapid development and employment of modern analytical equipment and technology, natural active components with anticancer activity or anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects have been studied and identified from Chinese medicinal plants Lien and Li, 1985, Ohigashi et al., 1994, Tsai, 2001, Xiao et al., 2000. They belong to various categories based on their chemical structures. The most commonly found active constituents include terpenes (sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes), alkaloids, coumarins, lignans, quinones, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenes, curcuminoids, polysaccharides, etc. Some of them are alleged to have antioxidant activity Larson, 1988, Ho et al., 1994, Ng et al., 2000, Xiao et al., 2000, Mau et al., 2002. Antioxidant activity is a fundamental property important for human life. Many of the biological functions, including antimutagenicity, anticarcinogenicity, and antiaging, among others, may originate from this property Mclarty, 1997, Niki, 1997, Yang et al., 2001.",

            "text": "It is important to select and employ a stable and rapid method to assay antioxidant activity, because the determination of hundreds of samples is time-consuming. Several methods have been developed to assay free radical scavenging capacity and total antioxidant activity of plant extracts. The most common and reliable method involves the determination of the disappearance of free radicals using a spectrophotometer, such as 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid radical (ABTS\u2022+) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH\u2022). Miller et al. (1993) first developed the ABTS\u2022+ method and Brand-Williams et al. (1995) established the DPPH\u2022 method. Reduction of ABTS\u2022+ or DPPH\u2022 by a radical species (R) (ABTS\u2022+ or DPPH\u2022+R\u2022 \u2192 ABTS-H DPPH-R) or by an antioxidant (A) (ABTS\u2022+ or DPPH\u2022+A \u2192 ABTS-H or DPPH-H + A\u2022) causes a loss of absorbance at 734 nm or 515 nm, respectively. The two original methods have been modified and improved in recent years. Specially, Re et al. (1999) improved the traditional ABTS\u2022+ method based on the activation of metmyoglobin with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ABTS\u2022+ to produce the radical cation. The improved method directly generated the blue/green ABTS\u2022+ chromophore through the reaction between ABTS and potassium persulfate. This new method has been successfully developed and applied in this study for assaying total antioxidant activity of medicinal plant extracts on a large scale.",

Quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and their glycosides were the predominant flavonols, occurring in many medicinal herbs associated with anticancer, e.g. flowers of Sphora japonica and Rosa chinensis\n(Fig. 4D), aerial parts of Artemisia annua\n(Fig. 4A), rhizomes of Alpinia officinarum, fruits (hawthorn) of Crataegus pinnatifida. Flavanols, such as catechins (flavan-3-ols), were also widespread in the tested medicinal herbs, e.g. Camellia sinensis (tea) and Acacia catechu (catechu) that contained large amounts of catechins. Flavanones and flavanonols, such as naringenin, hesperetin, liquiritin, and their glycosides, were mainly found in the medicinal herbs of Rutaceae (e.g. citrus fruits), Rosaceae, Leguminosae, etc. Isoflavones were mostly detected in the medicinal herbs of Leguminosae, such as roots of Astragalus mongholicus. Anthocyanins, including anthocyanidins (e.g. cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, etc.) and their glycosides, were mainly found in flowers of the medicinal herbs, such as inflorescences of Prunella vulgaris.",

            "text": "Tannins were identified as another large class of phenolics in the tested medicinal herbs (Table 1). More than 32 of the species contained tannin constituents preliminarily examined using protein precipitation method. Of these, 19 species contained considerable higher proportions of tannins, such as Chinese Galls (47 %), Acacia catechu (catechu) (41.2%), Punica granatum (19.3%), and Sanguisorba officinalis (13.5%). Tannins are generally subdivided into hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Hydrolyzable tannins contain a central core of polyhydric alcohol such as glucose, and hydroxyl groups, which are esterified either partially or wholly by gallic acid (gallotannins) or hexahydroxy-diphenic acid (ellagitannins) Chung et al., 1998, Mueller-Harvey, 2001. Famous examples of gallotannins were Chinese tannins (50\u201370% of dry weight) from Chinese Galls (Xiao et al., 2000). In this study, gallotannins from sample of Chinese Galls were determined below 50% of dry weight, likely due to samples collected from different sites and using different measurement methods. Several ellagitannins were isolated from fruits of Terminalia chebula and peels of Punica granatum. Condensed tannins are structurally more complex, and more widely spread among the plants than hydrolyzable tannins. They are mainly the oligomers and polymers of flavan-3-ols (catechins), also known as proanthocyanidins Xiao et al., 2000, Schofield et al., 2001. Some authors (Chung et al., 1998) considered that the polymerized products of flavan-3,4-diols also belong to the category of condensed tannins, also called leucoanthocyanidins. For instance, it was observed that Camellia sinensis and Areca catechu contained proanthocyanidins and leucoanthocyanidins, respectively. Some plant species may produce complex mixtures containing both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. It was found that the tannins identified in Acacia catechu, Sanguisorba officinalis, Rosa chinensis, and Punica granatum in this study belonged to the complex mixtures (Table 1). The HPLC profile (Fig. 4D) of methanolic extracts from Rosa chinensis exhibits typically separated peaks (R\nt 8\u201325 min) of tannin constituents. However, detailed tannin constituents will require further identification by MS and NMR.",

Statistical results of this larger number of samples revealed that antioxidant activity of the tested medicinal herbs was significantly correlated to total phenolic content (all R\n2 values \u22650.950, Fig. 2), strongly confirming that phenolic compounds were the dominant antioxidant components in the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs associated with anticancer.",

Structure-activity relationship of some phenolic compounds (e.g. flavonoids, phenolic acids, tannins) has been studied Rice-Evans et al., 1996, Lien et al., 1999, Son and Lewis, 2002. In general, free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of phenolics (e.g. flavonoids, phenolic acids) mainly depends on the number and position of hydrogen-donating hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring of the phenolic molecules, and is also affected by other factors, such as glycosylation of aglycones, other H-donating groups (-NH, -SH), etc. For example, flavonol aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin, and kaemperol, containing multiple hydroxyl groups, had higher antioxidant activity than their glycosides such as rutin, myricitrin, astragalin. The glycosylation of flavonoids reduced their activity. There were many reports on antioxidant components, generally focusing on flavonoids and phenolic acids Rice-Evans et al., 1996, Nakatani, 2000, Zheng and Wang, 2001, but relatively fewer on other phenolic antioxidant components. Through preliminary identification and analysis of phenolic compounds, we summarized that typical phenolic compounds in the tested medicinal herbs were of several major types, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, lignans, quinones, stilbenes, and curcuminoids. Some representative constituents of major phenolic types were also identified in Table 1. However, it is believed that thousands of phenolic compounds occur in the medicinal herbs. For instance, more than 4,000 kinds of flavonoids and hundreds of coumarins and lignans have been reported as naturally occurring compounds Iwashina, 2000, Xiao et al., 2000. Therefore, further chemical identification of phenolic compounds in the tested medicinal herbs will be required to reveal the possible structure-activity relationship of various types of phenolics.",

The traditional Chinese medicinal plants associated with anticancer might be a potential source of powerful natural antioxidants and beneficial chemopreventive agents. Chinese medicine emphasizes disease prevention and whole-body homeostasis instead of disease-oriented therapy. There is sometimes no strict borderline between medicinal treatment and dietary manipulation. Some medicinal herbs associated with anticancer, such as green tea (Camellia sinensis), fruits of Lycium barbarum, Juglans regia, and Crataegus pinnatifida, rhizomes of Zingiber officinale, and leaves and stems of Portulaca oleracea, are ordinarily used for pharmaceutical purposes and also as health foods and teas/soups in China. The beverages made from the tested medicinal herbs (e.g. Prunella vulgaris, Chrysanthemum indicum, Chrysanthemum morifolium, Lonicera japonica) are popular in China. The healthy alcoholic drinks are usually steeped with Chinese medicinal herbs, e.g. fruits of Lycium barbarum, roots of Panax ginseng, Angelica sinensis, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Another popular form of dietary therapy is daily consumption of Chinese soups prepared with plant materials including some tested medicinal herbs.",

            "text": "Many studies have revealed that intake of natural antioxidants is correlated with low incidence of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases associated with ageing, but there are still controversial opinions Hertog et al., 1995, Mclarty, 1997, Albanes and Hartman, 1999. Phenolics in vegetables, fruits, spices, and medicinal herbs might prevent cancer through antioxidant action and/or the modulation of several protein functions. Phenolics may inhibit carcinogenesis by affecting the molecular events in the initiation, promotion, and progression stages (Yang et al., 2001). Phenolics demonstrated agonism and/or antagonism of carcinogenesis-related receptors such as arylhydrocarbon receptor, epidermal growth factor, and estrogen receptor \u03b2. They modulated the secretion of protein kinases in tumor cell proliferation, and induced the expression of anticarcinogenic enzymes or inhibited induction of cancer-promoting enzymes Ho et al., 1994, Wadsworth and Koop, 1999, Owen et al., 2000, Sakakibara et al., 2003. Some phenolics possessed potent antioxidant activity and also had anticancer/anticarcinogenic/antimutagenic activities, such as phenolic acids (e.g. chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid), flavonoids (e.g. vitexin, quercetin, wogonin, genistein, catechins, isoflavones), quinones (e.g. emodin, rhein, aloe-emodin), coumarins (e.g. 7-hydroxy-coumarin), stilbenes (e.g. resveratrol), curcuminoids (e.g. curcumin), lignans, etc. Ho et al., 1994, Gao et al., 2000, Owen et al., 2000, Xiao et al., 2000, Yang et al., 2001, Tapiero et al., 2002. Moreover, some tannin molecules (e.g., tea polyphenols) have anticancer or anticarcinogenic or antimutagenic activity Chung et al., 1998, Kaur et al., 1998. Chung et al. (1998) pointed out in their review that the anticarcinogenic or antimutagenic potential of tannins might be related to their antioxidative properties. Therefore, phenolic antioxidants in the tested medicinal herbs and their antioxidative properties might play a role in preventing and treating cancer. However, some studies have not shown any relationship between consumption of natural dietary antioxidants and lower incidence of chronic disease such as cancer. Some evidence from in vitro studies and clinical studies is controversial. For example, observational epidemiological data for some sites are fairly consistent and supportive of a beneficial association between \u03b2-carotene and human cancer, but the preventive trial-based findings do not substantiate a beneficial effect of \u03b2-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence or mortality (Albanes and Hartman, 1999). The effects of an antioxidant may be tissue/site specific. The evidence for a protective effect for vitamin C appears to be strongest for cancers of the stomach, upper aerodigestive tract, and pancreas, but there is little evidence to support a protective relationship between either vitamin C and cancers of the colon, breast, or prostate (Mclarty, 1997). Although dietary flavonoids have been observed to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro (Kuo, 1997), a seven-country study containing 16 cohorts showed that the average flavonoid intake did not seem to be a determinant of cancer mortality (Hertog et al., 1995).",

The anticancer-associated TCMs not only contained much higher levels of phenolics than dietary plants, but also had many more kinds of phenolics, including tannins, coumarins, lignans, quinones, stilbenes, curcuminoids, and others (phenolic alkaloids, phenolic terpenoids, special phenolic glycosides), except flavonoids and phenolic acids. The protective effects of natural antioxidants may result from the action of complex/unknown/lesser-known antioxidants or from a concerted action of the cocktail of antioxidants present in dietary/medicinal plants. The association between the consumption of natural antioxidants and lowered cancer risk needs to be observed consistently in different studies. Therefore, it is required to further scientifically measure anticancer activity of the Chinese medicinal plants associated with anticancer. It is also necessary to make a thorough investigation of the relationship between anticancer and antioxidant activity of their phenolic compounds on a large scale to reveal whether their relationship is positive or negative. In addition to the analyzed phenolic compounds in this study, other types of anticancer constituents possibly occurring in the tested medicinal samples also warrant further analysis.",

            "text": "From a Chinese medicine viewpoint, tumor therapy is usually based on the theory of heat and toxin clearing. Nearly two fifths of the medicinal herbs tested in this study belong to the category of herbal medicines with heat and toxin clearing attributes. This category exhibits a wide range of biological effects in addition to antioxidant activity, such as antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic activities which may be related to some phenolic compounds (Shen and Li, 2002). It was reported that some medicinal herbs associated with anticancer, such as Viola yedoensis, Prunella vulgaris, and Paeonia suffruticosa, had anti-HIV activity (Collins et al., 1997). Notably, several common medicinal herbs with antiviral effect, such as Isatis indigotica, Forsythia suspense, Lonicera japonica, Artemisia capillaries, Prunella vulgaris, and Taraxacum mongolicum, form a Chinese Medicine prescription currently popular in China for the effective prevention and treatment of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Chinese Medicine (CM) treats diseases including tumors with formulae (conventionally 4\u201312 herbs) prescribed by CM practitioners, very seldom with a single medicinal herb. The therapeutic effects of the prescription are often interpreted in a magical or mystical way in traditional Chinese medicine. This is likely due to the synergistic effects caused by the combination of the medicinal plants from the prescription. Also, application of Chinese medicinal formulas may change some of the bioactive constituents from single medicinal plant extract. Therefore, elucidation of bioactive components and their biological functionality in the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs associated with anticancer and their medicinal formulas will contribute to a more rational scientific understanding.",

Large variation was found in total antioxidant capacity (\u223c370-fold) and total phenolic content (\u223c230-fold) among 112 tested medicinal herbs. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants associated with anticancer demonstrated significantly stronger antioxidant activity and contained much more phenolic compounds than common vegetables and fruits. A positive and significant correlation existed between antioxidant activity and total phenolic content, revealing that phenolic compounds were the dominant antioxidant components in the tested medicinal herbs. Phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, lignans, quinones, stilbenes, and curcuminoids were identified as major types of phenolic compounds. The investigation of the inter-relationship between phenolic compounds and antioxidant/anticancer activity will be a promising field to understand and elucidate possible mechanisms for the functionality of traditional Chinese medicines for cancer prevention and treatment.",
