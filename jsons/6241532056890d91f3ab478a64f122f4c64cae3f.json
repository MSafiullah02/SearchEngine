Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia .",

Another benefit of isolation is to reduce the mortality, that is, whenever a high-risk individual is diagnosed, he/she can get prompt treatment. However, high-risk individuals are often scattered in a city, and the number of available quarantine vehicles that are eligible to transfer high-risk individuals is limited. Therefore, we must efficiently schedule the vehicles, i.e., assign high-risk individuals to the vehicles and determine the route of each vehicle (as illustrated by Figure 1 ), to transfer the individuals to isolated regions as quickly as possible to control the spread of the epidemic.",

For large instances of the problem, exact algorithms (such as branch-and-bound) are often impractical, and traditional metaheuristic algorithms (such as genetic algorithms) also converge slowly [2] . To handle this difficult problem, we propose a hybrid water wave optimization (WWO) [3] and neighborhood search algorithm, which adapts the WWO metaheuristic to efficiently explore the solution space of the problem and utilizes neighborhood search to improve the solution accuracy. Compared to most existing metaheuristics that require many generations to evolve a large population to explore the solution space, the proposed WWO algorithm evolves a small population of solutions to rapidly locate an optimal or near-optimal solution. The neighborhood search method uses a gradual strategy to further improve the solution accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on real-world instances for transferring thousands of high-risk individuals during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Hangzhou city, China.

Daskin and Haghani [31] studied an emergency VRP that extends the basic VRP to an emergency scene by allowing edge travel times to be normally distributed and the path travel times of different vehicles to be correlated. In [32] Haghani et al. evaluated different response strategies including first-called first-served, nearest-origin assignment, and flexible assignment for assigning response vehicles and guiding those vehicles through non-congested routes. Vargas-Villamil [33] used mixed-integer nonlinear programming to solve a vehicle routing and dispatching problem for emergency personnel evacuation from off-shore oil platforms. Wang and Deng [34] studied an emergency VRP in post-disaster, where customer demands are described as the fuzzy variables; they proposed a two-stage approach, where the first stage optimizes the vehicle routes to minimize transportation time, and the second stage uses fuzzy linear programming to minimize transportation cost. Wohlgemuth et al. [35] considered a dynamic VRP with varying travel times and unknown orders in the specific environment of emergencies; they used a multi-stage mixed integer programming method to find solutions that decrease delays and increase equipment utilization. Chini et al. [36] studied a VRP in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios; they proposed a routing algorithm for graph-represented mission spaces and a switching algorithm to dynamically change the vehicle behavior according to the time-variable configuration of both vehicles and targets. Ye et al. [37] studied an emergency evacuation path planning problem in catastrophic events, which was modeled using an improved cellular automaton based on ACO. Considering fire evacuation scenarios, Shahparvari and Abbasi [38] proposed a greedy heuristic method to solve a VRP under uncertainties in evacuee population, time windows, and bushfire propagation; they applied their approach to a real case study of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia.",

Moreover, traditional evolutionary algorithms also converge slowly in large search spaces, and therefore studies on adapting evolutionary algorithms for emergency VRPs are relatively few. Sun et al.

Chen [40] utilized a GA to solve an emergency VRP with strict timeliness requirements. Du and Yi [41] also tested the performance of GAs for a multi-objective emergency VRP. Nevertheless, the results showed that classical GAs only perform well on small or medium instances. To solve emergency transportation that combines cumulative VRP and multi-depot VRP, Wang et al. [42] proposed an improved ACO algorithm with a smart design of the ant tabus to speed up solution construction. Recently, Fallahi and Sefrioui [43] studied a problem of scheduling ambulances to bring the maximal number of alive victims to hospitals; they proposed a memetic algorithm that employs variable neighborhood search to improve solution accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of VRPs for transferring high-risk individuals in epidemic areas, mainly due to the specific characteristics of the problem in the epidemic situation.",

Based on the distances between the areas and the velocities of the vehicles, we can obtain the travel time t i,j of each vehicle v i from its original location to each area a j , the time t i,j,j for v i to travel from a j to a j , and the time t i,j for v i to travel from a j to the isolated region (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m; 1 \u2264 j, j \u2264 n). We also have the average time interval t i,j between loading two individuals in a j by v i , which depends on the dispersion of individuals in the area (for example, if individuals are gathered in a community health center, the interval can be several seconds; if individuals are in different units of a housing estate, the interval can be several minutes). The inputs indicate that we can use vehicles with different capacities and velocities, and thus the problem is a heterogeneous VRP. Table 1 lists the variables used in the problem formulation.

Here, we adopt the strategy of improved WWO that discards refraction and reduces the population size with an increasing number of generations. We adapt the propagation operator to evolve a solution Z = (X, Y) to this problem as follows: let n X = \u2211 m i=1 n i be the total length of X, for each dimension d < n X , with a probability of \u03bb(Z), reverse a subsequence from dimension d, where the length of the subsequence is randomly set between [1, n X \u2212d]. Note that if the subsequence does not contain a separator, then the reversal only changes the route of one vehicle, but does not change the set of areas assigned to the vehicle; otherwise, it changes the routes of and reassigns the areas among two or more vehicles; in particular, after a reversal, it is probable that an area occurs in a subsequence more than once, and in such a case we remove the duplicates. The expected number of reversal on the solution is \u03bb(Z)n X , so a high (low) fitness solution will be changed to a short (large) extent. If the best resulting solution is better, it will replace the original one in the next generation. The pseudocode of the propagation operation is given in Lines 5-7 of Algorithm 1.",

            "text": "The computational environment is a workstation with an i7-6500 2.5GH CPU, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and an NVIDIA Quadro M500M card. In each instance, as it is required to produce a solution within ten minutes, the maximum CPU time of each algorithm is set to 600 seconds. The last four algorithms are stochastic; in a real-world application, we typically run an algorithm once, or simultaneously run several instances of the algorithm with different random seeds and submit the best solution obtained to the decision-maker. However, to make the comparison more objective, we make up the number of runs of the ACO, memetic, tabu search, and WWO algorithms to 30 after the application. Table 3 presents the results in terms of the average exposure time (in minutes) obtained by the algorithms on the test instances. For the last four algorithms, we present both mean value and standard deviation (in parenthesis). Figure 3 also illustrates the comparative results, where the maximum and minimum values obtained by WWO are given by error lines. As we can observe, the proposed algorithm achieves the shortest average exposure time (shown in bold in Table 3 ) on each instance. On instance J28 where the numbers of areas and high-risk individuals are relatively small, the differences among the algorithms are not significant, and the result of CPLEX is the second best. However, with an increasing number of areas/individuals, the performance of CPLEX becomes the worst among all algorithms on the six remaining instances. This is because, for large instances, the exact algorithm of CPLEX can only explore a very small fraction of the solution space within the limited running time. The ACO algorithm performs the worst on instance J28, but it outperforms Greedy and CPLEX on the remaining instances. The memetic algorithm performs the second-worst on J28, the second-best on J29, and the third-best (below tabu search and WWO) on the last four instances. This demonstrates that the population-based ACO and memetic metaheuristics can explore the large solution space in an efficient (if not the most efficient) way. The performance of the greedy heuristic is unstable, worse than that of CPLEX on J28 and F01 while better than that of CPLEX on the remaining instances. That is, on some specific instances, the greedy heuristic can sometimes reach a good solution, but its general performance is far from satisfactory. The tabu search algorithm starts from a greedy solution and then iteratively improves it. It performs relatively well on medium-size instances F01, F02, and F03; on small-size instances, its performance heavily relies on the unstable initial solution; on large instances, it cannot effectively explore the large solution spaces as the population-based metaheuristics. The average exposure time obtained by the greedy heuristic method used by the organization in the past is 337 minutes, while that of the proposed WWO-based algorithm is 206 minutes, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the efficiency of epidemic control. Inevitably, the exposure time calculated based on the objective function of a solution is not equal to the actual exposure time obtained by the implementation of the solution. Thereby, we compare the calculated and actual exposure times on the test instances in Figure 4 , from which we can observe that, except on F01 the calculated time is longer than the actual time, on each remaining instance the actual time is longer. This is because the solutions obtained by our algorithm have high qualities, i.e., they schedule the vehicles in an efficient and \"compact\" way; when a vehicle is delayed by an unexpected incident, many areas (especially those requiring multiple rounds of transfer) may be seriously affected, which can cause a significant increase of the total exposure time. Nevertheless, the calculated time does not deviate much from the actual time, which demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of the solution produced by our approach. In summary, the application of our method can be divided into the following steps.",
