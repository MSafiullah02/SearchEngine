This change from live to virtual interviews impacts the costs of interviewing for applicants and training programs and is worth reviewing further.",

As only two studies provide information about the monetary cost of fellowship interviews, additional reviews were performed of articles focusing on residency interview costs.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Although limited by their retrospective nature and usual survey response rate biases, the aggregated information demonstrates the expensive nature of fellowship interviews. An interviewee would have spent approximately $6,000 for live interviews applying for surgical fellowships in 2020, adjusting for inflation. Over fifteen hundred residents from surgical specialties applied for fellowships in 2019. If there are a comparable number of fellowship applicants in 2020, the cumulative saved cost of not having live interviews would be $9 million ($6,000 \u00d7 1,500 applicants), though that total needs some correction as there are fellowship applicants who interviewed in person before the implementation of social distancing measures.",

The cost reduction of video interviews was obviated when applicants completed a \u201csecond look\u201d live visit. Residency applicants to the University of New Mexico in the 2011 Urology match were randomized to web based interviews or traditional live interviews; all virtual interviewees were later re-interviewed in person. Applicants in this study by Shah et al. felt less rapport with faculty and perceived virtual interviewing to be a less effective method to properly represent themselves.25 Applicants and faculty favored web based interviews as an adjunct rather than a replacement of live interviews. Pediatric surgery applicants to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in Saint Petersburg, Florida in the 2017 interview season participated in video interviews prior to on-site interviews. Chandler et al. found that in addition to technical difficulties, applicants expressed concerns about the limited number of faculty interviewers and inability to view the hospital; they also missed observing how surgical faculty and trainees interact.26 Healy et al. reported that while in the minority, 15% of candidates who participated in videoconference interviews for adult reconstruction fellowship at Newton-Wellesley Hospital's Kaplan Joint Center between 2015 and 2017 did not feel they presented themselves to their satisfaction, 19% were not comfortable ranking the program, and 34% stated that videoconference interviews had an unfavorable impact on their ranking of the program.24 These studies demonstrate that despite the reduction in financial spending, there are less quantifiable costs to applicants\u2019 abilities to convey themselves and assess a program with virtual recruitment.",

            "text": "With COVID-19, virtual interviews have been a necessary adjustment for fellowship training programs in match seasons, and they may be the future of residency and fellowship recruitment. With the Association of American Medical Colleges reporting median graduating student debt of $200,000 in 2019, virtual interviews advantageously reduce additive costs to preexisting economic hardship.27 They minimize surgery resident absences from their training programs. Virtual interviews may be utilized in a two-tiered screening program to narrow applicant pools and host candidates who have greater interest in the program.24, 25, 26 Nevertheless, there are concerns about the equivalency of virtual interviews to live recruitment. Thus, recommendations for improvement opportunities:\u2022Surgery programs should work closely with faculty and staff to become more facile with videoconferencing to diminish loss in productivity secondary to unfamiliarity or discomfort with technology.25 They can use web streaming or pre-produced videos to highlight traditionally unique \u201clive\u201d aspects of interview days like the campus and city tour.24 Websites can be supplemented with narrated slide decks and podcasts to save on hard copy or emailed reproductions of program materials usually prepared for applicants.\u2022Further centralization of fellowship virtual interviews using uniform platforms may streamline processes for candidates and programs.\u2022Fellowship candidates and faculty members should prepare for virtual interviews as they would for live interviews to maximize the use of time.28\n,\n29 Fellowship programs should help accommodate applicants whose home environments may not be appropriate for professional interviews or who may need modifications of their interview days due to clinical responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery.30\n\u2022Ongoing applicant and program surveys are needed to learn more about the cost benefits and disadvantages of the widespread use of virtual interviews.\n",
