Herein, we studied the relationship between ectoparasitic infections with the wing mite (Spinturnix myoti) and the size of the breeding colonies, sex, age, and body condition index (BCI) of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The influence of environmental quality in the Carpathian Mountains (Poland) was also examined. We found significant differences in mite abundance and BCI between different breeding aggregations of the greater mouse-eared bat and also between the host sex/age categories. The most heavily infected bats were adult M. myotis females, while young males appeared to be the least infected. The BCI differed significantly between the sexes in young bats (males had a higher BCI than females) and also between colonies. No significant differences in the BCI were found for adult females. We did not find any relationship between the infestation rate of M. myotis, their colony size, the quality of environmental resources (percentage of forest cover around the colony), or the BCI. The prevalence of the various developmental stages of the mites did not differ between the host sex/age categories; however, differences were found in the sex ratios of deutonymphs and adult mites between adult M. myotis females. We predict that parasite load may not be dependent on colony size itself, but mainly on microclimatic factors, which are in turn directly correlated with colony size.",

This pattern is particularly widespread among birds, which form large colonies, especially during the hatching and rearing periods (Brown and Brown 1986; R\u00f3zsa et al. 1996) . A positive correlation between parasite infection intensity and host density has been observed in most colonial bird species (Brown and Brown 2000) . This may be the result of an increased transfer of ectoparasites between hosts (mainly through horizontal transfer), which is indirectly confirmed by increased parasite infection in nonbreeding bird colonies (Blanco et al. 1997) .",

Parasite infections also depend on host sex; while in the majority of mammal species, males are more heavily infected than females Morand et al. 2004) , in bats, the preference for females is prevalent (Zahn and Rupp 2004; Christe et al. 2007; Patterson et al. 2008) . Parasite preferences are determined by the condition of the host, which results from the availability of food resources Hawlena et al. 2006 ) and host physiology, and especially by immunosuppressive effects (Christe et al. 2000) , which are in turn influenced by androgens (Klein 2004) . Nevertheless, parasites can exploit both well-fed hosts in better condition, which are difficult to colonize, and vulnerable hosts in worse body condition, which are easier to colonize (Christe et al. 2003; Hawlena et al. 2005) . Furthermore, ectoparasite reproduction is also strongly dependent on abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity, which can directly affect the level of parasite infection (Merino and Potti 1996; Hawlena et al. 2006; Pearce and O'Shea 2007) .",

In two European species of bats, a positive correlation between the size of breeding colonies and the relative density of spinturnicid mites has been documented (Lu\u010dan 2006; Reckardt and Kerth 2009; Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o et al. 2012) . In turn, no correlation between parasite infection and aggregation size has been found in two South Asian bat species, Tylonycteris sp. (Zhang et al. 2010) . Higher ectoparasite infection rates in large host aggregations should have a negative impact on host condition, but the influence of ectoparasites on bat condition is still insufficiently understood. For example, significant differences in parasite load between bats (Myotis myotis) living in cave and attic colonies are not reflected in the condition of the host and its immune response (Uhrin et al. 2010 ).",

In the spring, adult M. myotis females form breeding colonies numbering from a few to hundred individuals (attics) or even several thousand individuals (caves). Colonies may be situated in attics (central Europe) or in caves (southern Europe) (G\u00fcttinger et al. 2001) . At the end of May, females give birth to one young, which is nursed for about 3-4 weeks and becomes self-sufficient at 6 weeks of age (Pandurska 1998; Zahn 1999) . Colonies disperse in mid-August (Zahn 1999; Zahn et al. 2006) .

In this region, woodless areas, coniferous forests, and deciduous forests form a mosaic. Meadows and farmlands are dominant in the lowlands, while at higher elevations, there is an increased proportion of deciduous and coniferous forests, with a minor presence of open areas (meadows). There are several dozens of known atticbreeding colonies of M. myotis in the Beskids (Kozakiewicz 2003; Szkudlarek et al. 2008 ; own data) (Fig. 1 ). The number of bats in breeding colonies ranges from 7 to 700 individuals (with an average of 145). Seven breeding colonies of M. myotis were selected which were at least several years old and differed in size from 50 to 250 individuals (females with young) ( Table 1 ). All maternity aggregations were housed in church attics. For each of the seven colony sites, we calculated the percentage of forested area (potential foraging habitat) within a radius of 10 km around each nursery roost. The area of forest cover was assessed based on Google satellite maps using GetArea12c in CorelDraw 11.",

            "text": "Female-biased infestation rates may be the cost of female sociality in most bat species (Reckardt and Kerth 2009 ). However, our observations indicate that in greater mouseeared bats (M. myotis), the difference in infestation between young females and males increases during the lactation period, which cannot be explained by differences in the grooming activity rate or variance in immunocompetence. This may indicate that mites prefer one host sex over the other, which may be caused by hormonal signals (Klein 2004 (Klein , 2005 . In turn, sex/age groups of the host did not differ in terms of the prevalence of mite developmental stages (protonymph, deutonymph, and adult stages), suggesting a lack of preference for a particular sex or age of the host. The only differences in the sex ratios of mites were found in adult M. myotis females in the form of a female overrepresentation in deutonymph and adult stages. This disproportion in the sex ratio may be due to selective mite removal or the effect of selective mite preferences for female adult hosts. Size differences between the sexes in Spinturnicidae species should affect susceptibility to grooming: individuals of the larger sex could be more easily removed from wings by the host. Because S. myoti females are larger than males, we would Beta standardized regression coefficient, p probability expect the inverse proportion, that is, an overrepresentation of males (the effect of the grooming mortality of the larger sex), which was not the case. Selective choice of host sex and age by the different mite developmental stages and sexes has not been the subject of research yet. To fully elucidate the differences in the proportion of mite sexes, it would be necessary to study the Spinturnicidae life cycle, employing both field observations and laboratory experiments.",

            "text": "It is known that in species forming large aggregations, the parasite infection rate increases with colony size (R\u00f3zsa et al. 1996; Brown and Brown 2000; Krasnov et al. 2002) . This pattern has also been observed in nonbreeding bird colonies (Blanco et al. 1997) . In most cases, group size was positively correlated with the prevalence and intensity of parasites, which were typically directly transmitted (Patterson and Ruckstuhl 2013) . A positive correlation of bat maternity aggregation size with infestation rates was found in two species: Myotis daubentonii (Lu\u010dan 2006; Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o et al. 2012) and Myotis bechsteinii (Reckardt and Kerth 2009 ). These two Myotis species mostly used tree holes or bat boxes for maternity roosts: breeding colonies in this type of shelters consist of a maximum of 144 individuals for M. daubentonii (Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o et al. 2005 ) and up to 45 individuals for M. bechsteinii Kerth 2006, 2009) . First, this type of shelters is very compact, which in the case of high host density may limit grooming and facilitate parasite transfer (both vertical and horizontal). On the other hand, an increased ectoparasite abundance results not only from better survival but also from greater reproduction, which is in turn highly dependent on temperature and humidity (Marshall 1982; Moyer et al. 2002; Bartoni\u010dka and Gaisler 2007) . The major effect of humidity on the reproduction of wing mites is consistent with their significantly higher abundance in cave breeding colonies than in attic ones, despite the similar size of host maternity aggregations (Uhrin et al. 2010; our data) . In Eptesicus fuscus, a higher abundance of wing mites was observed in wet years than in dry seasons (Pearce and O'Shea 2007) . Second, the thermal conditions of forest roosts are relatively stable (woodpecker tree holes; Kerth et al. 2001) or modified by external conditions only to a small extent: from a few (woodcrete bat boxes; Kerth et al. 2001 ) to several degrees above the external temperature (wooden bat boxes) (Louren\u00e7o and Palmeirim 2004; Kerth et al. 2001) . The presence of bats in a small space also affects the microclimate of the refuge: the humidity and mean temperature inside bat boxes have been reported to be positively correlated with the number of bats due to their respiration (Bartoni\u010dka and \u0158eh\u00e1k 2007) . In contrast to forest shelters (bat boxes or tree holes), the microclimate of attics (humidity and temperature) is strongly dependent on the external temperature and is independent of the presence of bats (Zahn 1999; Louren\u00e7o and Palmeirim 2004; Postawa and Gas 2009; Uhrin et al. 2010) . Hence, the direct cause of increased ectoparasite loads is probably not the size of the bat cluster but the higher humidity in the shelter. The variability of microclimate in attics (particularly low humidity) should explain the lack of correlation between mite abundance and the size of the host aggregation in our study.",

An increase in the abundance of Spinturnix psi in Miniopterus schreibersii was negatively correlated with host condition during the nursing period, but not during pregnancy, mating, or hibernation (Louren\u00e7o and Palmeirim 2007) . A high abundance of wing mites in M. myotis and M. daubentonii deteriorated host condition in adult females during pregnancy and in juvenile bats during autumn movements (Zahn and Rupp 2004) . In the M. daubentonii-Spinturnix andegavinus system, a negative correlation during the post-lactation period and autumn movements was found for juvenile bats, and, unexpectedly, a positive correlation during the post-lactation period for adult and subadult females (Lu\u010dan 2006) . In turn, the wing mite Spinturnix bechsteini infecting M. bechsteinii showed a higher abundance on hosts in medium condition (Reckardt and Kerth 2009 ). As can be seen, in some cases, bat ectoparasites exhibit a well-fed host selection strategy, while in other cases a vulnerable host selection strategy (Christe et al. 2003) , and their impact on host condition seems to depend on the annual cycle and age of the host.",

In our study, we found no relationship between parasite infection levels and the BCI. The absence of obvious interactions between the parasite infestation rate and host condition might be due to nonlinear associations between parasite load and host body condition, which have been suggested by some authors (Lu\u010dan 2006; Reckardt and Kerth 2009) . In field studies of parasite-host models, often only one ectoparasite species is investigated, while others may be ignored even if their prevalence is similar. This can hinder interpretation because it is not known which parasite pressure influences the health status of the host. Another reason may be the imperfection of the BCI. In fact, the BCI reflects the lipid content of the host's body (Pearce et al. 2008 ) but does not provide information about the host's immunological response to the presence of parasites. An increase in the abundance of blood-sucking parasites induces greater energy expenditure due to higher blood consumption and at the same time leads to an increase in the amount of food intake in the host, but only marginally affects the host's body condition . Blood-sucking ectoparasites may affect the host's status not only directly through the depletion of resources but can also be vectors of pathogens. For instance, Bartonella spp. (Hornok et al. 2012 ) as well as Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. have been detected in the S. myoti collected during the breeding period of M. myotis (Szubert-Kruszy\u0144ska et al. 2009 ). Moreover, a high prevalence of viruses (coronaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses) has been found in the feces from a breeding colony of M. myotis (Drexler et al. 2011) .",

Hence, while the size of maternity aggregations is not directly correlated with parasite load, it can directly affect the microclimate of bat shelters and, as a result, indirectly influence the parasite infection rate. Consequently, the relationship between parasite load and host condition still remains unresolved and requires further studies to be better understood.",
