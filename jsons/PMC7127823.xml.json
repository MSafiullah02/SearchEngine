Not unexpectedly, there are changes in the type of TAI reflective of the changing destinations \u2013 from tourism to work and destination based travel, and the local, endemic illnesses found therein [5]. The most common sites for contracting malarial illness, the most common TAI in one study, were sub-Saharan Africa (77%), and Oceania (6%) [1], [2]. Giardiasis and Dengue fever were the second and third most commonly diagnosed TAI respectively. Of note, gastrointestinal illness represented ~25% and febrile or viral syndrome caused about 10% with respiratory syndromes affecting about 5% of TAI patients. These data are not unexpected given travelers often spend upwards of 7 \u2013 17 hours in close proximity during airline travel. Even with improved ventilation and air turnover in modern jet travel, the small distance between and prolonged exposure to people make travelers vulnerable to respiratory and other infections. Financial considerations impact airlines; it is obvious to any frequent flier there remains a lack of proper between-flight cleaning of surfaces (seatback trays, lavatories, arm rests) which increases the likelihood of disease transmission. Frequent hand washing, avoiding touching nose, mouth and eyelids are important basic approaches travelers can take to reduce risk, as well as proper vaccination.",

In the aftermath of avian and swine influenza outbreaks, an ebola event that was unlike others in the past, and evolving, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such advice must now be called into question. Consider global travel and immigration into the United States from countries with endemic illnesses not commonly found in North America. Also societal factors (domestic and international) that include poverty, homelessness, institutionalization, overcrowding \u2013 in health care facilities as well as domiciles \u2013 and lack of access to timely healthcare, these all set the stage to create conditions that facilitate the spread of diseases that are from previously unknown, little recognized, or emerging pathogens. Endemic, even novel strains in foreign lands, can become very quickly clinical realities and community-wide problems in the U.S. That is to say, we now need to think zebras as well as horses. And why it is important to obtain a thorough travel and occupational history from patients who present with an atypical or severe, progressive illness. Such information may give valuable insights into the origin of the infection, the etiological pathogen, how to access timely information from sources experienced in treating the cascade of symptoms (biodrome) [10], thus allowing you to more rapidly initiate appropriate, potentially life-saving interventions.",
