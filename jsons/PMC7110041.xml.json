From this pool we can compare the characteristics of microbes that are able to infect the target host versus those that manifest no evidence of an ability to infect the target host. Molecular characteristics that facilitate cross-species transmission are likely to be substantially different between viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, because of large differences in the pathobiology of these different taxa.",

Our analyses indicate that viral species infecting domestic artiodactyls are more likely to infect humans if they complete replication in the cytoplasm without nuclear entry. The observed effect of cytoplasmic replication on host-jumping ability is not surprising given the complex molecular pathways regulating nuclear entry. Viral species that are unable to complete replication in the cytoplasm require intracellular transport from the site of penetration, targeting of the nucleus through nuclear localization signals, and importation of genetic material, proteins, and/or whole virions through the nuclear pore complex [10]. The combination of molecular mechanisms governing this chain of events is likely to be highly host specific, because of strong selective pressure against admission of foreign particles into the nucleus. To date, discussion of barriers to viral replication has largely focused on receptors for cellular entry. The concentration on this aspect of the viral life cycle exists for 2 substantive reasons. First, the inability to enter a cell obviously precludes viral replication; second, several well-documented viral host jumps have been shown to occur after point mutations that modify interactions between viral particles and cellular receptors [11\u201313]. The effect of nuclear entry seen in our data set emphasizes that cellular entry, while a necessary step, is insufficient for completion of the viral life cycle.",

The hypothesized effect of segmentation, in particular, may be obscured in our data set by a combination of the small number of viral species with segmented genomes and the absence of segmented DNA viruses.
