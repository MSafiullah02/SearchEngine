[1] As a highly contagious disease, COVID-19 has killed more people than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) combined, despite an relatively low case-fatality rate. [2, 3] Although it mainly attacks respiratory system, other systems including cardiovascular system are also influenced by COVID-19. Acute cardiac injury (ACI) is also one of the noteworthy issues which researchers have noticed in several studies. [4] [5] [6] [7] \uf020 According to the study by Chen, et al. [8] , ACI was among the most common critical complications during exacerbation of COVID-19. In the newly published article, researchers found that ACI was not only a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but also was associated with high risk of in-hospital mortality. [9] Another cohort study also showed that ACI was associated with fatal outcome of patients with COVID-19, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVD). [10] The underlying mechanism of ACI in COVID-19 patients is still under debate. Some different theories maybe try to explain this phenomenon.",

[11, 12] SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 by binding of the spike protein to ACE2, which further causes the disturbance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes ACI in COVID-19. [13] * The authors contributed equally to this manuscript. Acute myocarditis is also believed to be responsible for ACI in COVID-19. Alhogbani, et al. [14] reported a case with significant cardiac involvement infected by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MeRS-CoV). The laboratory test was negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis and cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute myocarditis. Similarly, Inciardi, et al. [15] reported a healthy 53-year-old patient developed acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, which confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed one week later. However, there is no pathological evidence for this theory.",

For patient with ACI, more aggressive airway management procedures and supportive measurement, such as invasive mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), should be considered in these patients. [20] In conclusion, the underlying mechanism of ACI in COVID-19 is complicated (Figure 1 ). But according to the pathological findings, the main mechanism of ACI in COVID-19 could be hypoxia.
