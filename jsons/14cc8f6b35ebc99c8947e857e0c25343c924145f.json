There have been various research groups that focus on understanding the viruses in terms of their hostviral relationships, pathogenesis and immune evasion. However, with the current advances in the field of science, now the research field has widened up at the 'omics' level. Apparently, generation of viral sequence data has been increasing. There are numerous bioinformatics tools available that not only aid in analysing such sequence data but also aid in deducing useful information that can be exploited in developing preventive and therapeutic measures. This chapter elaborates on bioinformatics tools that are specifically designed for animal viruses as well as other generic tools that can be exploited to study animal viruses. The chapter further provides information on the tools that can be used to study viral epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis, structural modelling of proteins, epitope recognition and open reading frame (ORF) recognition and tools that enable to analyse host-viral interactions, gene prediction in the viral genome, etc. Various databases that organize information on animal and human viruses have also been described.

In humans, viruses are known to cause infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, AIDS, diarrhoea, encephalitis, dengue fever and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola (Singh et al. 2017a) , Zika (Singh et al. 2017b) , etc. Despite the vaccines and treatments for such diseases, morbidity and mortality both occur as a result of the viral infections. Viral disease of animals not only affects the production but also is a threat to humans (Saminathan et al. 2016) . A rapid growth in the availability of sequencing methods and a vast amount of viral sequence data have been generated during recent times. Thus, it is imperative to decipher this data using more advanced tools such as bioinformatics resources. A large number of bioinformatics tools that can aid in the analysis of viral genomes and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies have been developed for human as well as animal viruses.

However, due to small genome size, viruses have complex methods to maximize the coding potential of genomes and evolution. Many viruses utilize overlapping reading frames or translational frameshifts to code for multiple proteins from limited genome sequences. Also, higher rates of mutations and recombination between related viruses pose a challenge in accurate phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of viruses using general-purpose softwares. Lately, enormous growth in the volume and diversity of viral sequences in the databases has been seen.

A comprehensive list of these packages and web servers is maintained by Joe Felenstein at http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 248, "text": "(Felsenstein 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phylogeny and Molecular Epidemiology"}, {"text": "An open reading frame (ORF) is the part of genome that translates into a protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ORF/Gene Discovery"}, {"text": "Finding ORF is one of the key steps in viral genome analysis. It forms the basis for further analysis such as homologous search, predicting proteins, functional analysis and viral vaccine and antiviral target discovery. If an ORF translates a surface protein that is unique to that virus, it may elicit immune responses and could potentially be a vaccine candidate. ORF Finder by NCBI is a ORF prediction program (Rombel et al. 2002) . The program outputs a range of each ORFs along with its protein translation in six possible reading frames from the input DNA sequence. It can be used to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding sequences and to verify predicted proteins using SMART BLAST or BLASTP (Altschul et al. 1990 ). However, the web version of the program is limited to a query sequence length of 50 kb only. A standalone system has no limitation on length but is available only for the Linux 64 operating system. NEG8, a 167-codon novel ORF in segment 8 of influenza virus, was visualized using ORF Finder (Clifford et al. 2009 ). Using the ORF Finder in association with the basic local alignment search tool BLAST, 154 ORFs were found in the Hz-1 virus genome (Cheng et al. 2002) . Due to small genome size, viruses employ multiple strategies to maximize the coding potential including frameshifts and alternative codon usage. Thus, virus-specific programs have been developed to overcome these challenges. GeneMark (http://opal.biology. gatech.edu/GeneMark/genemarks.cgi) provides gene prediction tools for viruses (Besemer and Borodovsky 2005) .

An epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the receptors of immune system components such as antibodies, B cells or T cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epitope Recognition"}, {"text": "Epitopes have been generally classified as either linear or conformational epitopes. T cells recognize linear epitopes, short continuous strings of amino acids derived from protein antigen, presented with MHC class I molecules. B cells and antibodies, on the other hand, recognize conformational epitopes which are formed by interactions of amino acids with multiple discontinuous segments forming a threedimensional antigen (Barlow et al. 1986 ). Owing to the simple linear structure of T cell epitopes, their interaction with receptors can be modelled with high accuracy (DeLisi and Berzofsky 1985) . A large number of prediction databases and servers thus are available for linear epitope prediction. MHCPEP (Brusic et al. 1998) , SYFPEITHI (Rammensee et al. 1999) , FIMM (Schonbach et al. 2005) , MHCBN (Bhasin et al. 2003) and EPIMHC (Reche et al. 2005 ) are some of the commonly used T cell epitope prediction programs. Immune epitope database and analysis resource (https://www.iedb.org) (Vita et al. 2015) offers the most comprehensive set of tools for epitope analysis for epitope prediction covering HLA-A and HLA-B for humans as well as chimpanzee, macaque, gorilla, cow, pig and mouse and is one of the few databases that cover such a variety of organisms. Since 2011, IEDB uses NetMHCpan as prediction method. NetMHC server uses the artificial neural network method to predict binding of peptides to different alleles from human as well as 41 animals including cattle and pig (38 from core). The database also contains curated data for many viruses including influenza and herpesviruses. B cell receptors and epitope interactions are more complex in nature than the linear epitopes for T cells; thus, accuracy of B cell epitopes is relatively low. Furthermore, most of the current databases are centred on linear rather than conformational epitopes. Bcipep is a tool developed for predicting the linear epitope of B cells (Saha et al. 2005) . Epitome is a database of structure-inferred antigenic residues in proteins (Schlessinger et al. 2006) . Epitome is especially useful in the prediction of antibodyantigen complex interaction. The database is available at http://www.rostlab.org/ services/epitome/. AntiJen is an intricate database with entries on both T cell and B cell epitopes.

Using this online tool, along with secondary structures, solvent accessibility and possible transmembrane helices can be predicted. Further, it also provides expected accuracy of prediction methods. SWISS-MODEL (http:// swissmodel.expasy.org/) is a popular tool for the prediction of a 3-D structure of a protein. 3-D structure prediction programs usually employ homology searching using similar and known protein structures as templates. One of the most commonly used database for such templates is Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Reddy et al. 2001) .

However, analysing viral genomes using general bioinformatics tools could compromise the accuracy and sensitivity of analysis. Virus genomes are too small (e.g. < 10 kb) to compute statistics with their codon usage. To maximize the coding potential, viruses work with unusual codon usage patterns comprising of overlapping coding and non-coding functional elements. Additionally, viruses also rely on other translational mechanisms such as stop codon read-through, frameshifting, leaky scanning and internal ribosome entry sites. Comparative genomic analysis of viruses is complicated by the fact that highly conservative sequences may not be coding for anything. Presence of overlapping pairs may be indicated by conservation for the sequences where there is overlapping of CDSs and/or non-coding functional elements. Novel virus types comprise of new CDSs that are different than previously known CDSs. There are multiple databases and tools available for analysis of human viruses; however, there are still only a limited number of resources designed specifically for veterinary viruses. In this section, some of the databases and resources useful for the analysis of veterinary viruses are discussed (Table 23 .1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1316, "end": 1325, "text": "(Table 23", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Virus-Centred Bioinformatics Tools"}, {"text": "Viruses are one of the most diversified and dynamic microorganisms. With increasing viral genome sequencing, there was a need to develop bioinformatics tools to compare and analyse the voluminous data. To meet this requirement, one such downloadable software package is Base-By-Base, which aids in analysis of whole viral genome alignments at single nucleotide level (Brodie et al. 2004 ). Moreover, with the online resource Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V), comparative studies can be made using the generic tools such as ClustalW, BLAST and Keyword Search algorithms (Hirahata et al. 2007 ). Another downloadable web server tool, ViroBLAST, is an exclusive BLAST tool that can be used for queries against multiple databases (Deng et al. 2007 ). Sequences from a variety of viral strains can be analysed simultaneously using the Alvira software, which is a multiple sequence alignment tool that provides graphical representation as well (Enault et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, comparative analysis of genes and genomes of coronavirus can be carried out by using the CoVDB (coronavirus database) (Huang et al. 2008 ). The digital resource ViralZone is designed specifically to comprehend viral diversity and acquire information on viral molecular biology, hosts, taxonomy, epidemiology and structures (Hulo et al. 2011 ). The Simmonics program was upgraded to the simple sequence editor (SSE) software package, wherein the user-given sequences can be aligned and annotated and further can be analysed for diversity and phylogeny (Simmonds 2012) . Evolutionary changes in viral genome lead to polymorphisms in their proteins, which in turn result into changes in viral phenotype such as viral virulence, viral-host interactions, etc. The digital database, ViralORFeome, not only stores all variants and mutants of viral ORFS, but also provides tools to design ORF-specific cloning primers (Pellet et al. 2010 ). Further, degenerate primer pairs can be selected and matched to amplify user-defined viral genomes using the online tool PriSM (Yu et al. 2011 ). The recent advances in nextgeneration sequencing and technologies have facilitated to study viral population at an advanced level. The viral population biodiversity and dynamics can be studied using the first such tool developed, PHACCS (Phage Communities from Contig Spectrum), that can analyse the shotgun sequence data to estimate the structure and diversity of phages (Angly et al. 2005) . Later on, more tools/resources were developed to analyse viral metagenomics sequences, such as Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenomic Exploration (VIROME), Viral MetaGenome Annotation Pipeline (VMGAP) and Metavir (Lorenzi et al. 2011 , Roux et al. 2011 , Wommack et al. 2012 .

Further, various features such as frameshifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, etc. can be predicted in the virus genome. Additionally, a mature peptide can be predicted in a given polypeptide open reading frame. VIGOR is also capable of genotyping influenza virus and rotavirus. Four output files -a gene prediction file, a complementary DNA file, an alignment file, and a gene feature table file -are produced by VIGOR. GenBank submission can be directly done using the gene feature table.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Host Interaction and Miscellaneous Softwares"}, {"text": "Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU) facilitates quick and efficient annotation of similar target genome using the reference genomes that have already been annotated.

GATU utilizes tBLASTn and BLASTn algorithms to map genes onto the new target genome by using an annotated reference genome. As a result, majority of the new genome's genes are annotated in a single step. With GATU, users can also identify open reading frames present in the target genome and absent from the reference genome. These ORFs can further be scrutinized by using other bioinformatics tools such as BLAST and VGO, which can determine if the ORFs should be included in the annotation.
