In particular, the mtDNA hypervariable region I was sequenced for all individuals using previously described primer pairs (Morin et al. 1994) and compared with published sequences (Morin et al. 1994) to infer the maternal origin of each individual. Three regions (sY19, sY84, and sY123) on the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (Stone et al. 2002) were also sequenced for the three male chimpanzee individuals in our sample and compared with previous data from P. troglodytes subspecies (Stone et al. 2002). Since the paternal origin of the six females in our sample could not be determined, we used data from 26 autosomal biallelic markers for STRUCTURE analysis (Pritchard et al. 2000). In particular, one SNP was randomly selected for each of the chromosomal genomic regions we resequenced in P. troglodytes (n = 16). Ten additional variants were included and derived from genotyping of these same individuals at ten genes (one SNP per gene in PTPN22, CD4, IFIH1, LY9, AICDA, PON1, OAS1, SFTPD, CTLA4, and PIAS1), which we are currently analyzing in this species (manuscript in preparation). STRUCTURE was used in the \u201cadmixture\u201d mode so that individuals are allowed to have ancestry from multiple populations. We used a model of correlated allele frequencies with 100,000 burn-in iterations and 1,000,000 follow-on Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations. The program was run 20 times for each value of K ranging from 1 to 4, and for each run, the posterior probability of K = 1, 2, 3, or 4 was calculated. Results of these runs indicated that a model with K = 1 has much higher probability compared with the other values of K (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online).",

Patients were all of the relapsing\u2013remitting form of MS, and they have been diagnosed and selected using the McDonald criteria (McDonald et al. 2001). The female to male ratio was equal to 2.1:1 in the assessed samples. The control group of healthy individuals is composed of 1,917 adult volunteer blood donors, unrelated to each other and to the patients and also 231 affected family-based controls (AFBAC) derived from 231 MS family trios. AFBAC allele and haplotype frequencies are constructed using the two alleles in each trio that are not transmitted from the parents to the affected child. These familial pseudocontrols are matched to the cases for ethnic origin and are thus robust to population stratification (Thomson 1995). All individuals studied and all analyses on their samples were done according to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the local medical ethics and institutional review committees. Individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array, and standard quality control filters were applied (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] call rate > 98%, Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, HWEP value > 10\u22126, minor allele frequency > 1%, lack of excess of Mendelian errors or discrepancies in genotyped trios or DNA duplicates) (Sanna et al. 2010).

We obtained maximum likelihood (ML) estimates for these parameters minimizing the goodness-of-fit test statistic (as reported in Wittke-Thompson et al. (2005)) using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method. Using an estimate of Kp, the procedure was repeated with a general model estimating q, \u03b2, and \u03b3, and for constrained specific models, estimating q and gamma (dominant: beta = \u03b3; recessive: \u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 > 1; additive: \u03b2 = (\u03b3 + 1)/2, \u03b3 > 1; and multiplicative: \u03b2 = sqrt(\u03b3), \u03b3 > 1). Given the different number of parameters in the general model, the Akaike information criteria were used for the best-fit model selection. A P value was then calculated for the minimal value of the test statistic using a \u03c72 distribution with 1 or 2 degrees of freedom (df) for the general and constrained models, respectively.",

Calibrated coalescent simulations were performed using the cosi package (Schaffner et al. 2005) and its best-fit parameters for YRI, AA, CEU, and AS populations with 10,000 iterations. For SAI, a previously reported demographic model (Ray et al. 2010) was used and included in the cosi best-fit model. Demographic parameters for YRI, AA, CEU, and AS implemented in cosi are described in Schaffner et al. (2005). Coalescent simulation was also run using additional demographic models (Marth et al. 2004; Voight et al. 2005; Gutenkunst et al. 2009). In all cases, they were conditioned on mutation and recombination rates. Estimates of the population recombination rate parameter \u03c1 were obtained from resequencing data with the use of the Web application MAXDIP (http://genapps.uchicago.edu/maxdip/) (Hudson 2001) and converted in centimorgan per megabase. The lower recombination rate obtained from the five populations in each region was used in coalescent simulations; these amounted to 0.31 cM/Mb for ZC3HAV1 exons 10\u201312 and 0.0025 cM/Mb for the region covering exon 13. P values of summary statistics for the analyzed ZC3HAV1 regions were obtained by comparing the observed DT, D* and F* with the distribution in the 10,000 simulated genealogies.",

Haplotypes for individuals resequenced in this study are available as supplementary table S2 (Supplementary Material online). LD analyses were performed using the Haploview (v. 4.1) (Barrett et al. 2005) using SNP data from HapMap and default parameters (HWEP value cutoff = 0.001, minimum genotype percentage = 75%, maximum number of Mendel errors = 1, minor minimum allele frequency = 0.001). Haplotype blocks were identified through the confidence interval method (Gabriel et al. 2002). The significance of LD was assessed by means of a standard chi-square statistic as implemented in graphical overview of linkage disequilibrium (GOLD) (Abecasis and Cookson 2000) and Bonferroni corrected for the number of tested SNP pairs. GOLD groups low-frequency alleles to avoid spurious results: We used the default grouping strategy at 7%. An additional analysis of recombination was performed using the LDhat program (McVean et al. 2002), which uses the composite likelihood method of Hudson (Hudson 2001), extended to finite-sites models, to calculate the population recombination rate \u03c1 (4Ner) given an estimate of \u03b8W. The program then uses a likelihood permutation test to address the presence of recombination and identifies SNP pairs that display more or less LD than expected assuming a constant recombination rate over the entire region. Rare variants (i.e., with minor allele frequency lower than 5%) are omitted from the analysis as uninformative.",

Estimate of the time to the most common ancestor (TMRCA) was obtained using a phylogeny-based approach implemented in NETWORK 4.5 using a mutation rate based on the number of fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans. An additional TMRCA estimate derived from application of a ML coalescent method implemented in GENETREE (Griffiths and Tavare 1994, 1995). The method assumes an infinite-site model without recombination; therefore, haplotypes and sites that violate these assumptions need to be removed: In the case of ZC3HAV1, we eliminated three variants. Again, the mutation rate \u03bc was obtained on the basis of the divergence between human and chimpanzee and under the assumption both that the species separation occurred 6 Ma (Glazko and Nei 2003) and of a generation time of 25 years. The migration matrix was derived from previous estimated migration rates (Schaffner et al. 2005). Using \u03bc and \u03b8 maximum likelihood (\u03b8ML), we estimated the effective population size parameter (Ne); this result equaled 22,400. With these assumptions, the coalescence time, scaled in 2Ne units, was converted into years. For the coalescence process, 106 simulations were performed. A third TMRCA estimate was obtained by applying a previously described method (Evans et al. 2005) that calculates the average pairwise difference between all chromosomes and the MRCA: This value was converted into years on the basis of mutation rate retrieved as above. The SD for this estimate was calculated as previously described (Thomson et al. 2000).",

In order to analyze the evolutionary history of the PARP-like domain, we resequenced two distinct genomic regions covering exons 10\u201312 (region 1, 2.40 kb) and 13 (region 2, 2.05 kb) (fig. 1) in five human populations (Yoruba, YRI; African Americans, AA; Europeans, CEU; East Asians, AS; and South Americans, SAI). The number of segregating variants identified in each human population for the two regions is reported in table 1. The statistical significance of LD between SNP pairs was evaluated using these data and indicated stronger LD in the region encompassing exon 13 (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). An additional analysis of recombination in the two regions was performed using a composite likelihood method implemented in LDhat (McVean et al. 2002). In both regions and for the five populations analyzed separately, values of \u03c1 equal or very close to 0 were obtained, and the likelihood permutation test revealed no evidence of recombination. No SNP pair in either region displayed significantly higher or lower LD than expected given the SNP frequencies and the estimate of \u03c1 \u223c 0.",

The multilocus HKA test was developed to verify this expectation (Wright and Charlesworth 2004). Specifically, we applied a multilocus MLHKA (maximum likelihood HKA) test by comparing polymorphism and divergence levels at the ZC3HAV1 regions with 16 NIEHS genes resequenced in YRI, AA, CEU, and AS. As specified in the Materials and Methods, these genes were randomly selected among NIEHS loci shorter than 20 kb that showed no evidence of natural selection (Fumagalli, Cagliani, et al. 2009). No significant excess of intra- versus interspecies diversity was observed for region 1 (table 2). Conversely, ZC3HAV1 region 2 displays a significant excess of polymorphism compared with divergence in all populations (table 2). It is worth noting that ZC3HAV1 is located on chromosome 7 in tandem orientation with a homolog, ZC3HAVL1. Yet, this latter displays no PARP-like domain and, therefore, no alignment with ZC3HAV1 across exons 10\u201313.

Another hallmark of balancing selection is a distortion of the SFS toward intermediate frequency alleles. Thus, to gain further insight into the evolutionary history of the two ZC3HAV1 regions, we applied SFS-based tests, such as Tajima's D (DT) (Tajima 1989) and Fu and Li's D* and F* (Fu and Li 1993). We evaluated the statistical significance DT, D* and F* by means both of coalescent simulations that incorporate demographic scenarios (see Material and Methods) and of empirical comparison with the distribution of these statistics calculated over 2-kb windows. Most statistics failed to reject the null hypothesis of selective neutrality for the ZC3HAV1 region 1 (table 1). Conversely, SFS-based statistics calculated for region 2 yielded significantly high values both in coalescent simulations and empirical comparisons for YRI, CEU, and AS. As for SAI, coalescent simulations yielded a significantly low value for DT and a significantly high result for D*. Very similar results were obtained with SFS-based statistics that incorporate out-group information (from orangutan in this case), namely Fu and Li's F and D, whose statistical significance was calculated through coalescent simulations (table 1). Comparable percentile ranks were also obtained using the distribution of 5-kb reference windows (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online) and by applying different demographic scenarios in coalescent simulations (see Materials and Methods) (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online).",

Although one of these SNPs (rs10250435) occurs at a CpG dinucleotide, suggesting that it may be accounted for by independent mutations arisen after speciation, rs3735007 (C/T) does not involve a CpG and represents a nonsynonymous substitution (Thr851Ile). The probability of observing n shared SNPs in a genomic region where segregating sites are observed in two species is given by the hypergeomtric density (Clark 1997). Nineteen and 6 non-CpG SNPs segregate in humans and chimpanzees, respectively, in the ZC3HAV1 resequenced region. Thus, the probability of observing one polymorphism at the same position over a length of 1,969 non-CpG nucleotides amounts to 0.055; given that roughly 2/3 of substitutions are accounted for by transitions in humans (Nachman and Crowell 2000), the probability of observing the same alleles in the two species amounts to \u223c0.036 for transitions (which is the case of rs3735007). The same calculation can be performed for SNPs that occur at CpG dinucleotides (five and three in humans and chimpanzees, respectively): In this case, by considering 66 CpG dinucleotides in the human/chimpanzee ancestor, the probability of observing a shared polymorphism involving a CpG amounts to 0.199; among substitutions at CpGs, roughly 75% are transitions (Nachman and Crowell 2000), resulting in a probability of 0.15 to observe the same alleles in the two species at the same CpG site. Thus, the combined probability that the two trans-specific polymorphisms have occurred independently in the two lineages is low (P = 0.0054).",

To test this possibility, we performed population genetic analyses in this species. Since we had no information concerning the geographic origin and subspecies type of these individuals, we addressed this issue first. Analysis of mtDNA indicated that all of them had P.t. verus maternal origin; similarly, the three male chimpanzees had Y chromosomes suggesting P.t. verus paternal ancestry. STRUCTURE analysis of these individuals using 26 autosomal loci (see Materials and Methods) indicated that a model with only one cluster (k = 1) had much higher probability compared to models with K = 2, 3, or 4 (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), suggesting that all individuals belong to the same subspecies (i.e., P.t. verus). In order to assess whether ZC3HAV1 shows unusual levels of nucleotide variability, we resequenced 16 genomic regions in these same individuals to be used as an empirical comparison. All regions were similar in size to ZC3HAV1 region 2 and are described in the supplementary table S5 (Supplementary Material online). Ten of these regions were intergenic and previously proposed to be neutrally evolving (Frisse et al. 2001); six more intergenic regions were randomly selected with the only requirement that no gene was annotated within 200 kb. Calculation of \u03b8W and \u03c0 indicated that region 2 in ZC3HAV1 shows the highest values of diversity compared with the 16 reference regions (fig. 2). This result was confirmed by application of the MLHKA test, which yielded significant results (k = 2.95, P = 0.049). Conversely, SFS-based statistics (DT, F* and D*) were not exceptionally high in this region (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). In order to analyze the haplotype genealogy for the ZC3HAV1 region 2 in chimpanzees, we constructed a median-joining network; this indicated the presence of two major clades, with one basal branch carrying the trans-specific polymorphism (fig. 2). Haplotype frequency in our P. troglodytes sample was very different between the two clades, resulting in no excess of intermediate frequency alleles. This explains the failure of SFS-based tests to reject neutrality.",

The second approach is implemented in GENETREE and is based on an ML coalescent analysis (Griffiths and Tavare 1994, 1995). Using this method, the TMRCA of the ZC3HAV1 haplotype lineages amounted to 4.36 myr (SD: 1.05 myr) (fig. 3). A third TMRCA of 6.12 myr (SD: 2.2 myr) was obtained by the application of a previously proposed method based on the mean nucleotide diversity between all chromosomes and an MRCA (Evans et al. 2005).",

We took advantage of the availability of data from the 1000 Genomes Pilot project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010) to verify this expectation by analyzing sequence variation along the entire ZC3HAV1 transcription unit. The low-coverage 1000 Genomes approach, which generated whole-genome sequencing data of 179 individuals with different ancestry (YRI, CEU, and AS), is estimated to have relatively low power to detect singleton SNPs or rare variants (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010). Thus, sliding-window analysis and comparison with Sanger resequencing data also serve the purpose of testing the suitability of low-coverage data for large-scale identification of balancing selection targets. Therefore, we calculated \u03c0 and the ratio of \u03b8W over human\u2013chimpanzee divergence in sliding windows moving along ZC3HAV1. It should be noted that sliding-window analyses have an inherent multiple testing problem that is difficult to correct because of the nonindependence of windows. In order to partially account for this limitation, we applied the same procedure to 2,000 randomly selected human genes, and the distribution of \u03c0 and \u03b8W per divergence was obtained for the corresponding windows. This allowed calculation of the 95th percentile and visualization of regions that exceed this threshold; nonetheless, these analyses should be regarded as mainly exploratory and descriptive.",

In particular, the Thr851Ile polymorphism (rs3735007) was genotyped in 507 MS and 523 healthy controls (HC) from mainland Italy. A significant deviation from HWE with an excess of homozygotes was observed in cases but not in controls (P = 0.026 for MS subjects). Wittke-Thompson et al. (2005) have developed a test to verify whether deviations from HWE can be explained by an underlying genetic model for the trait being analyzed rather than by other effects. Using a Kp (prevalence of MS in the general population) of 0.0007 for Mainland Italy (Pugliatti et al. 2006), the best fitting of the genotypic proportions in cases and controls was obtained with a recessive model. The goodness-of-fit test was not significant (\u03c72 = 2.27, P = 0.32, df = 2) for this model, and the estimated \u03b3 (homozygote relative risk) was 1.38. These data indicate that a recessive model with only genetic effects adequately explains HWE deviation in the Italian sample. Comparison of genotype frequencies in MS and HC indicated a significant difference (Fisher's exact P value = 0.016, 2 df), and for a recessive model with CC homozygotes predisposed to disease, the odds ratio [OR] was 1.47 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.08\u20131.99, P = 0.011) (table 3). In order to replicate this finding, we obtained the genotype distribution of rs1047129, which is in tight LD with rs3735007 (r2 = 0.87), from a case\u2013control genome-wide association study for MS performed in a population of 4,416 individuals from Sardinia (2,270 patients and 2,146 controls). rs1047129 is located on the major branch leading to clade 2 (variant 24 in fig. 3), and its T allele is in phase with the rs3735007 C allele. No deviation from HWE was observed for rs1047129. As shown in table 3, the genotype frequency of this SNP significantly differed in cases and controls (for a recessive model with TT homozygotes predisposed to disease, OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.037\u20131.344, P = 0.011).",

            "text": "A large body of evidence suggests that long-standing balancing selection has shaped diversity at the human HLA class I and class II genes and maintained trans-specific polymorphisms at these loci (Lawlor et al. 1988; Mayer et al. 1988; Gongora et al. 1996; Charlesworth 2006). For HLA genes, natural selection is thought to promote diversity at the peptide-binding cleft of antigen presenting molecules and to be pathogen driven (Prugnolle et al. 2005). Outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), no human/chimpanzee trans-specific amino acid variant has been reported, and the scant descriptions of long-standing balancing selection in humans have involved innate immunity genes (Cagliani et al. 2008, 2010). This testifies the extraordinary relevance of adaptive immunity for organism survival but suggests that searching for long-standing signatures of natural selection might contribute to the identification of non-HLA loci and variants with a prominent role in immune response. Our data suggest that the Thr851Ile variant in the PARP-like domain of ZC3HAV1 has been maintained as a trans-specific variant in human and chimpanzee populations. Several evidences support this conclusion and argue against the possibility that the polymorphism results from concurrent mutation in the two species. First, as calculated above, the probability that the variant represents an independent mutation event in the human and chimpanzee lineages is low and much more so when the presence of a second shared SNP (albeit involving a CpG dinucleotide) is accounted for. Therefore, at least one of the two shared polymorphisms is likely to have arisen before speciation. The lower mutability of rs3735007 compared with the CpG SNP and its potential functional significance (it accounts for the Thr851Ile variant) make it a better candidate as a selection target. Second, all tests supported the action of balancing selection on ZC3HAV1 region 2 in human populations. Third, using different methods, we estimated TMRCAs of the haplotype genealogy ranging from 4.36 to 6.12 myr. These are much deeper than expected under neutrality, although they display large variances and differ sensibly from one another. This is expected as relatively few segregating sites are used for time estimates, despite high local diversity. Several studies have provided different estimates for the human/chimpanzee lineage split (with ranges from 4 to 7 myr; Glazko and Nei 2003; Kumar et al. 2005), again with wide confidence intervals. Therefore, although caution should be used when speculating on date estimates, the TMRCAs we obtained for ZC3HAV1 exon 13 might be consistent with the Thr851Ile variant having arisen before human/chimpanzee lineage split. Finally, analysis of the chimpanzee sample also suggested the action of natural selection, as demonstrated by the higher nucleotide diversity observed in ZC3HAV1. The average estimates obtained for \u03b8W (0.054%) and \u03c0 (0.056%) for putatively neutrally evolving regions are comparable to although slightly lower than previously reported data for P.t. verus populations both in intergenic and in genic regions (Gilad et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2003; Verrelli et al. 2006, 2008; Claw et al. 2010). This discrepancy may be due to the relatively limited number of individuals we resequenced. Still, the values we calculated for ZC3HAV1 are higher than those obtained for all other regions, suggesting the action of natural selection in the maintenance of diversity at this locus. Moreover, haplotype analysis indicated that, in analogy to the observation in humans, the trans-specific SNP separates the two major haplotype clades.",

Our comparison with Sanger resequencing experiments suggests that unequal coverage of repetitive elements (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010) may bias diversity estimates across the genome. Indeed, using a large number of gene windows resequenced by both the 1000 Genomes Project and by the NIEHS Program, we show that the presence of transposable elements biases nucleotide diversity estimates obtained through next generation sequencing approaches. Thus, large-scale efforts aimed at describing natural selection through the use of low-coverage data should be better performed after repeat masking.",

S3, Supplementary Material online) and virtually no evidence of recombination (as also evident from the haplotype genealogy; fig. 3). This is partially explained by the region being short; as mentioned above, signatures of long-standing balancing selection are expected to have a limited genomic span (in the order of a few hundred bases), given that they are eroded over time by both mutation and recombination, as determined by both simulations and real-data analyses (Wiuf et al. 2004; Bubb et al. 2006). Thus, the power to detect long-term balancing selection is higher in regions with low recombination rates (Wiuf et al. 2004), as the one we describe herein. In particular, Bubb et al. (2006) suggested that, in order to be detectable, long-standing balancing selection must involve at least two physically linked loci that are both selection targets (i.e., a balanced haplotype). This would allow accumulation of neutral variability over longer regions due to selection against most recombination events in the interval. Whether another variant in the region, in addition to Thr851Ile, represents a selection target remains to be evaluated, but this possibility might reconcile the strong LD we detected with the deep coalescence time of the haplotype genealogy.",

            "text": "The possible functional significance of the Thr851Ile variant is difficult to infer, as the role of the PARP-like domain itself is presently unknown. In order to evaluate the possible functional effect of the amino acid replacement, we applied several prediction algorithms. The GERP (Cooper et al. 2005) and Grantham scores (Grantham 1974) (\u22126.1 and 89, respectively) indicated that the position is not highly conserved and that the substitution is moderately conservative. Application of the PolyPhen (Sunyaev et al. 2001), PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei et al. 2010), SIFT (Ng and Henikoff 2003), Panther (Thomas and Kejariwal 2004), and SNPs&GO (Calabrese et al. 2009) algorithms suggested that the variant has relatively limited functional impact (not shown). Conversely, SNAP (Bromberg and Rost 2007) indicated the SNP to be nonneutral, although with very low reliability, and the use of MutPred (Li et al. 2009) yielded a relatively high general score (0.586) and a borderline probability (P = 0.054) that the variant might affect ubiquitination at a nearby Lysine residue (K849). Although potentially interesting given the known exploitation of the host's ubiquitin system for immune evasion, this result should be taken with caution as prediction of ubiquitination sites (using UbPRED, Radivojac et al. 2010 and CKSAAP_UbSite, Chen et al. 2011, not shown) yielded low scores for K849. Overall, a conservative interpretation of the results for prediction algorithms is that the SNP has no major effect on the function of ZC3HAV1. We consider that this finding is not in contrast with the hypothesis that rs3735007 represents the selection target; indeed, selection might have operated not by hampering or reducing protein function but rather by modifying its affinity or binding specificity for viral components, a possibility that is difficult to test by the use of available prediction algorithms. In fact, a previous analysis of the entire ZC3HAV1 coding region indicated that the PARP-like domain has been a target of selection during primate evolution, as well, suggesting that it serves some important function for survival or reproduction (Kerns et al. 2008). In line with these considerations, it has been demonstrated that the long ZC3HAV1 isoform containing the PARP-like domain has stronger activity against alphaviruses compared with the shorter form (Kerns et al. 2008). Therefore, a straightforward interpretation of our data envisages a situation where the trans-specific polymorphism affects either the specificity of viral recognition by ZC3HAV1 or the binding of a viral inhibitor to ZC3HAV1, two alternatives that were previously proposed to account for the positive selection signature of this region in primates (Kerns et al. 2008). One interesting possibility is a genetic conflict between primate hosts and viral pathogens involving the ZC3HAV1 PARP-like domain on one side and the viral macrodomains on the other. Macrodomains are conserved in several organisms and are generally referred to as X domains in the context of viral-encoded proteins (Gorbalenya et al. 1991). Apart from alphaviruses, few other viruses, including coronaviruses and rubella, possess X domains (Egloff et al. 2006; Neuvonen and Ahola 2009). Cellular macrodomains have the ability of inhibiting PARPs through a direct interaction (Ouararhni et al. 2006), and a recent report identified three macrodomains encoded by the highly pathogenetic SARS-CoV (Tan et al. 2009). The authors suggested that viral macrodomains might have evolved to counteract the antiviral activity of ZC3HAV1 (Tan et al. 2009). Whether ZC3HAV1 has any activity against coronaviruses and whether this occurs through the PARP-like domain remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, these observations suggest that ZAP might display an antiviral activity that extends beyond alphaviruses and filoviruses and may include more common human pathogens, such as rubella and coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Although a specific causative agent has never been identified, several evidences suggest that viral infections may cause or at least contribute to the development of MS. MS is an autoimmune disease which results from the exposure of genetically predisposed individuals to environmental factors which, in turn, trigger a breakdown in T-cell tolerance to myelin antigens. In line with the possible involvement of viral agents in the pathogenesis of MS, a recent report indicated that a polymorphism which decreases the enzymatic activity of OAS1, an antiviral response gene, is associated with MS predisposition and disease severity (O'Brien et al. 2010; Cagliani et al. 2011). This concept is supported by the observation that a subset of human genes involved in the pathogenesis of MS have been targets of virus-driven selection (Fumagalli et al. 2010). Data herein indicate that, in two independent and genetically distinct populations from Italy, variants in ZC3HAV1 confer a risk to develop MS. The reasons why this finding was not replicated in a Belgian sample remain to be elucidated and may derive either from insufficient statistical power of the study or from the interaction between ZC3HAV1 polymorphisms with environmental factors. Such an interaction occurs between the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and polymorphisms in its receptor: HAV infection is protective against atopy only in subjects carrying a polymorphic 6-amino acid insertion in the HAVCR1 mucin-like domain (McIntire et al. 2003). Indeed, gene-by-environment (GXE) interactions have been recently shown to represent a common attribute of complex diseases (Romanoski et al. 2010). In the case of MS, the relevance of GXE interaction remains to be evaluated, but several epidemiological studies (reviewed in Ebers (2008)) indicate that diverse environmental risk factors modulate disease prevalence. Also, it is worth mentioning that rs3735007 is included in a relatively large LD block that partially covers the nearby ZC3HAV1L gene (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), putatively encoding an antiviral protein with still uncharacterized function. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the association we detected with MS in the Italian cohorts is accounted for by a variant located in ZC3HAV1L. The probability is low that a nonsynonymous SNP in this latter gene is responsible, as the only one (rs17856272) displays very low frequency in CEU and limited LD (r2 = 0.038) with rs3735007. Still, other variants with regulatory function located within the LD block might account for the association with MS and need to be examined in further studies.",
