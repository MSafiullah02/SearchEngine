The mortality rate is about 2.3% in general population, with high human-to-human transmission of 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]), and nasopharyngeal asymptomatic carriers act as vectors within the population (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic on March 2020, and established objectives and action plan. First, WHO aimed at limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which required large isolation actions (country borders lockdown and individual quarantine). Second, WHO aimed at guiding and supporting the different health care systems across countries. Finally, developing therapeutic interventions appeared as a global priority as available evidence were still scarce (1). More than 860 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide.",

Europe is particularly concerned by this problem due to the aging of the population. In 2016, the European Union counted 98 million people aged 65 years or more, compared to only 80 million children aged 16 years or less (https://ec.europa. eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php). Moreover, it is noticeable that the isolation measures have reduced the availability of the primary care givers and led to delayed/ cancelled outpatients' clinics, which increases the risk of acute decompensation of chronic diseases and frailty process in shortand mid-terms, independently of the COVID-19 infection. In this context, implementing new technologies based on quantified-self and on-line resources may help optimizing older adults' health.",

Intrinsic capacity is focused on disease prevention, it has been related to the ability of individuals to overcome stressful or acute events (4, 6) . Intrinsic capacity has been recently associated with the onset of autonomy decline, falls, and death during a 3-year follow-up (5) .

The first one is that the project is timely, as there is an increasing, crucial need of providing support to Primary Care physicians and community-dwelling older patients; moreover, on-line health resources had raised in interest in the latest years (7) and now even more due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of the ICOPE project involves economic advantages because no additional materials are required to deliver support, with the exception of the human cost of the healthcare providers engaged. In addition, the ICOPE App is free-of-charge, suitable for all brands (Android/Phone) and devices (telephones, computers, etc.). Of course, online communication and technical devices required by the ICOPE App could be challenging for older adults. However, this limitation could be counteracted by taking the window of opportunity of the quarantine, which makes older people and their families more likely to get engaged in online communication. The new-acquired technical skills by the users are effective in controlling the environment e.g. receiving advice and professional support, therefore, the behavior is reinforced (8) . Finally, it is noticeable that using the ICOPE App may be slightly modified during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the original aim, which was to measure individuals' intrinsic capacity in a non-pandemic \"normal\" situation. This is also a great opportunity to unleash the potential of academic discoveries (9) .",
