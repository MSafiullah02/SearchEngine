By increasing the amount of globally accessible real-time information, today's ubiquitous producers contribute to a world, where an individual consumes vanishingly smaller fractions of all produced content. In general, consumers preferentially select information that closely matches their individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection is further magnified by today's information curation services that maximize user engagement (and thus service revenue) by filtering new content in accordance with observed consumer preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to increasingly narrower bands of the ideology spectrum. Societies get fragmented into increasingly ideologically isolated enclaves. These enclaves (or echo-chambers) then become vulnerable to misinformation spread, which in turn further magnifies polarization and bias. We call this dynamic the paradox of information access; 1 a growing ideological fragmentation in the age of sharing. This article describes the technical, economic, and socio-cognitive contributors to this paradox, and explores research directions towards its mitigation.",

We argue that modern online social media platforms that allow publishing information for potentially global access create a different type of paradox.

            "text": "This paradox is brought about by the disruptive change in content dissemination dynamics that occurred over a relatively short period of time in human history. Much in the way the invention of the press five hundred years ago revolutionized information dissemination, the advent of modern online social media platforms, as shown in Figure 1 , provides everyone with ample opportunities to publish near real-time information. We will refer to this development as democratization of publishing and access. Public information available on social media platforms is intended to have global visibility. Yet, the resulting increased volume of information (created by a vastly enlarged number of diverse producers) makes human attention an increasingly over-subscribed bottleneck. It necessitates information filtering, as recipients must make consumption choices. Information filtering is aided by algorithmic information curation services (e.g., search engines, ranking engines, and information recommendation systems) whose business model maximizes recipient engagement (e.g., clicks). In effect, information curation services optimize a self-loop; they give consumers more of what these consumers express interest in. When applied to information flow, this optimization leads to a situation where our existing biases impact how future information is prefiltered for our consumption, leading to feedback that reinforces these biases. The very channel that makes information sharing ubiquitous therefore mediates information visibility (e.g., by information ranking), preferentially offering different populations different content. This bias-reinforcing filtering, tailored to consumer biases, gradually erodes the common ground for dialogue among communities of different beliefs, creating the paradox: ideological fragmentation in an age of democratized global access. Figure 2 notionally demonstrates the effect of increased information volume. As the volume of accessible information increases, the fraction of it that an individual consumes (i.e., our individual coverage) decreases. If consumers choose to access information that is closer to their beliefs, the decreased coverage (centered around their belief) implies exposure to progressively narrower slices of the overall belief distribution. Larger ideological gaps emerge between information consumed by different parties. The narrowing exposure and growing ideological gaps facilitate the spread of disinformation, adding significant fuel to the polarization dynamics.",

For example, we increasingly seek (and spread) more sensational and surprising news [6, 7] . Seeking (and spreading) more outlying or surprising news is a collective learning efficiency tactic in that it avoids expending cognitive resources on processing redundant inputs. The tactic seems increasingly pronounced as the volume of information increases [7] , arguably biasing our collective attention towards more extreme content. Imitation is another efficiency tactic [8] . Replicating behaviors of role models and like-minded individuals obviates expending one's own cognitive resources (e.g., on ascertaining veracity of information we forward). Evidence suggests that its usage becomes more pronounced under time pressure [9] . We are thus more prone to replicating more outlying/extreme content and doing so with less verification, which increases prevalence of more extreme (mis)information flow.",

The contribution lies in developing force expressions that adequately model factors from social psychology, such as confirmation bias and social influence, that impact a node's motion in the belief space. This motion is shown to follow a particle diffusion-drift model that reduces to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation [10] , commonly used in the study of stochastic systems such as fluid dynamics. Solving for the steady state, the equation reveals a bifurcation of population density in the belief space (i.e., emergence of polarization), whose depth increases with information volume and misinformation.

Separating claims by their propagation patterns circumvents the need to understand local context. Groups of different biases propagate information differently, because each largely propagates items confirming their specific bias. It is therefore possible to construct a graph, where each individual is a node, and where individuals who share more similar content (e.g., propagate more of the same tweets) are \"closer\" together. Clustering the nodes in this graph separates the conflicted sides involved. Furthermore, identifying the most popular content propagated by each side determines the biases of that side.

Content that does not propagate strictly on group boundaries is likely to be less biased. The insight leads to solutions for understanding overlap in beliefs [21] . In turn, these solutions may help with automated de-biasing of collected information, possibly under the control of the end user. Metrics can also be designed to help users understand the degree of bias in content they are exposed to. Prior work has shown that excluding posts that fail the de-biasing test tends to increase the quality of remaining content [22] . In general, the approach described above allows developing services that give consumers control over the degree of bias in information they ingest. For example, they may choose to sample both sides, lean on one side, or choose unbiased content. Such explicit control does not exist with current curation services. This control might be most effective when combined with the technique described next; namely, information summarization.",

The approach taken by current curation services (e.g., search and ranking engines) relies on extractive summarization. Namely, it picks individual information items that best match the search query. This technique is fundamentally unsustainable in view of the continued growth in information volume; the \"best matches\" will constitute progressively smaller fractions of relevant content. We believe the next leap in curation will therefore need to adopt abstractive summarization: a distillation of content that directly conveys the main points. Abstractive summarization increases the effective fraction of content that an individual can digest within their capacity limits. It therefore reduces the impact of information overload (which, as Figure 3 shows, ameliorates ideological fragmentation).",

Our minds represent events at various levels of granularity and abstraction, which allows us to quickly access and reason about old and new scenarios. Progress in natural language understanding and computer vision has helped automate some parts of event understanding. Still, the current, first-generation, automated event understanding is overly simplistic since it is local, sequential and flat. Real events are hierarchical and probabilistic. Understanding them requires knowledge in the form of a repository of abstract event schemas (complex event templates), understanding the progress of time, using background knowledge, and performing global inference. When complex events unfold in an emergent and dynamic manner, the multimedia multilingual digital data from traditional news media and social media often convey conflicting information. To understand the many facets of such complex, dynamic situations, one needs cross-media cross-document event coreference resolution and event-event relation tracking methods to gain event-centric knowledge of such situations. These techniques can leverage solutions for algorithmic misinformation detection and bias mitigation, described earlier, to offer more reliable versions of transpired events. Current advances on this topic are overviewed in a recent survey of abstractive summarization techniques [23] .",

Yet, information curation services that filter or expose large volumes of information to inform users are not presently bound by any filtering quality or neutrality requirements.

Analysis of this phenomenon suggested several mitigation strategies, including mechanisms to ensure strong/secure content provenance, algorithmic fact-checking solutions to remove misinformation, techniques that mitigate curation bias, and overload mitigation strategies, such as abstractive summarization. Modern technical advances offer capabilities that can help construct such tools and formulate relevant optimization problems.
