We reviewed the most recent literature and guidelines in this field and organized the current recommendations for healthcare professionals caring for critically ill organ transplant recipients. Recent Findings The incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria comprise about 14% of organisms. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections are also on the rise, as 20.5% of nosocomial enterococci are now vancomycin-resistant, changing empiric antibiotic selection. Fluconazole-resistant Candida species comprise up to 46% of cases of candidemia in hospitalized patients. Consequently, new guidelines recommend primary use of echinocandins in patients with candidemia who have moderate-to-severe disease. Finally, the incidence of emergence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in patients is 5-12%, requiring early recognition and change to alternative regimens in the case of poor response to therapy. Summary Bloodstream infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in solid organ transplantation. Mortality as high as 24% and 50% have been reported with sepsis and septic shock respectively. As such, bloodstream infections should be diagnosed rapidly and intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately. Appropriate resuscitation should be initiated and the number and/or dose of immunosuppressive drugs should be reduced. Proper source control must also be achieved with radiologic drainage or surgical intervention as appropriate. Initial antibiotic treatment of these patients should cover both Grampositive organisms, especially in the presence of intravascular catheters, and Gram-negative bacteria. Echinocandins like caspofungin should also be considered especially in critically ill patients, particularly if a patient has been on total parenteral nutrition or broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

The dream of replacing a nonfunctioning organ, like a kidney or a liver, with a functioning organ became a reality in 1954, when Dr. Joseph Murray transplanted a kidney from one identical twin to the other [1, 2]. Over the past few years, there has been a significant improvement in survival and reduction in rejection after solid organ transplantation (SOT) as a result of more effective immunosuppression therapy. However, infections and particularly bloodstream infections (BSIs) still remain as a common complication and a major cause of death after transplant [3] [4] [5] .",

Community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia account for 40.7% and 59.3% of pneumonias in SOT, respectively. Hospital-or ventilator-associated pneumonia are typically diagnosed in the early post-transplant period with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, Acinetobacter species, Stenotrophomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA as the most common pathogens in the peri-operative period. Opportunistic infections are most commonly seen in 1-6 months after transplant, and community-acquired pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma species, Legionella species, and Chlamydia species, are more frequent after 6 months, though opportunistic infections can still be seen, especially if immunosuppression is increased for treatment of rejection.",

Broad-spectrum antibiotics with an activity against P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacilli should be started empirically. For patients with septic shock and need for new ventilatory support, two agents with activity against P. aeruginosa can be considered. In patients with a high risk of mortality, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit with > 20% MRSA prevalence, an anti-MRSA agent should also be started empirically. Empiric treatment should be modified based on previous microbiologic history and local antibiogram as well as patient's clinical response.

Small bowel transplant recipients followed by heart-lung, liver, and pancreas transplant recipients have the highest rate of IFIs respectively [39, 46] . Although Candida species remain the most common cause of IFIs in SOT, molds comprise approximately 40% of IFIs in this group of patients. Aspergillus species cause the majority of mold infections. Mucormycosis is the next most common mold infection. Cryptococcosis and endemic fungi are other etiologies for IFIs [39, 47] . Echinocandins like caspofungin are recommended for treatment of Candida sp. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend voriconazole as the treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis with isavuconazole and amphotericin B listed as alternative agents [50] .

While the incidence of ganciclovirresistant cytomegalovirus in patients on prophylactic valganciclovir is as low as 0-3%, the incidence of emergence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in patients receiving ganciclovir treatment is about 5-12% [58] . For patients whose viral loads fail to decline while on therapy, ganciclovir resistance test is recommended. For most patients with confirmed ganciclovir resistance, foscarnet is suggested [59] . Cidofovir is the other option when there is a concern for resistance [12\u2022\u2022] . Letermovir has also shown promising results in these patients, though it has not been approved yet for this indication [60, 61] .

Oral metronidazole is only recommended for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI if oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are not available[55]. Fidaxomicin has similar efficacy to vancomycin and has been associated with decreased rates of recurrent infection in immunocompetent patients; however, there is limited data on its efficacy in solid organ transplant patients[56\u2022\u2022]. For fulminant CDI, oral vancomycin (or rectal vancomycin for cases with ileus) in conjunction with intravenous metronidazole is recommended. Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the standard of care when toxic megacolon, perforation, or an acute surgical abdomen is present. Leukocytosis > 50,000/\u03bcL, lactate \u2265 5 mmol/L, and hypoalbuminemia are associated with impending shock. Urgent colectomy should be considered in these patients[57]. Fecal microbiota transfer is recommended in immunocompetent patients with multiple recurrence of CDI. Retrospective studies have reported efficacy and safety in SOT patients with recurrent CDI. Bezlotoxumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B, can be given to SOT patients with recurrent episodes of CDI[56\u2022\u2022].",
