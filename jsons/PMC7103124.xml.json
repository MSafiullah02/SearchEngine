            "text": "Camelids are an important animal production resource in many areas of the world. The reproductive efficiency of camelidae, particularly the Bactrian and dromedary camels, is generally considered low [1], [2], [3]. In camels, birthing rates rarely exceed 40% in nomadic herds and 70% in more intensive herds [1], [2]. In addition to low birthing rates, camel herds suffer from high neonatal loss sometimes reaching epizootic proportions [2], [3]. In South American camelids (SAC), llamas and alpacas, birthing rates are slightly better, but high rates of pregnancy loss and infertility represent a major complaint in practice [4]. In alpacas, the mean annual fertility reported is 50% [5], whereas in llamas the mean birth rate is 45.9% [6]. Low fertility in alpacas seems to be due to the 50\u201357.8% reported embryo mortality up to 30 d of gestation [7].",

In most females, infectious organisms are eliminated by natural uterine defense mechanisms. However, in a proportion of the females, these defense mechanisms fail partially or completely, allowing establishment of an infection. Although no studies have been carried out on uterine defense mechanisms in camelidae, they are likely to be similar to what is known in other species. The major mechanisms used by the female to clear uterine infection are local immunity, phagocytosis and mechanical clearance by myometrial contractions. These mechanisms are more effective during the follicular phase when blood estrogen concentrations are high and the uterus has maximal contraction [12], [16].",

In camelidae, during mating, the penis penetrates the cervical canal and enters deep into the uterine cavity [17]. Repeated insults of the uterus due to improper mating practices can lead to inflammation and loss of the ability to resist infection. Many breeders who are not familiar with the reproductive physiology of the female camelidae rely exclusively on \u201creceptive\u201d behavior for breeding. However, studies have shown that receptivity is not necessarily correlated with ovarian activity [20], [21]; this results in multiple matings that have little chance of achieving pregnancies, but cause damage to the endometrium and cervix [4], [21], [22], [23].",

Systemic signs are usually absent in cases of chronic endometritis. However, fever, depression and signs of toxic shock may accompany acute postpartum metritis [25]. In these cases, supportive therapy should be started immediately. Examination of the perineum and vulva may reveal mucopurulent discharge. In some cases, dried flakes of vaginal discharge may be present at the base of the tail. In the postpartum female, a thick, pinkish or white postpartum discharge (lochia) from the vagina is normal and may persist for up to 1 week after parturition. However, a profuse, watery or smelly discharge should be considered abnormal and a sign of postpartum metritis. Conformation of the vulva and perineum are very important in the evaluation of the barren female. An incompetent vulva or vestibulo-vaginal sphincter due to tears or laceration may be the primary cause of contamination of the vagina and uterus. Excessive vulvar edema may be associated with overbreeding, but can also result from excessive estrogen therapy [4], [8], [18].",

The latter technique should be performed after taking a uterine swab for microbiological evaluation [4], [18]. Uterine culture and cytology samples are preferably taken when the female is at peak follicular phase and the cervix is open. In large camelidae (dromedary, bactrian and llama) all of these procedures are performed using the same rectovaginal techniques used in the bovine. In alpacas, passage of the swab or pipette requires direct visualization and insertion into the cervix with the assistance of a vaginoscope. This is relatively easy to do when the alpaca has a mature follicle (uterus contracted and patent cervix) [4], [23]. The uterus flushing technique is by far the best, but has the disadvantage of being time consuming. For this technique, the uterus is flushed with a small quantity of sterile saline using either a Foley catheter or a mare insemination pipette. The fluid is collected, fixed in 40% ethanol and centrifuged to concentrate cells. Smears are prepared from the sediment, air-dried and stained with Wright\u2013Giemsa, Papanicolau stain or Hematoxyline and Pollack's trichrome. The degree of inflammation is assessed by evaluation of the amount and morphology of polymorphnuclear (PMNs) leucocytes. The presence of 3\u20135 PMNs per high power field is usually relevant in the diagnosis of endometritis. The causative microorganism may sometimes be observed in the cytology evaluation [4], [23].",

The most common bacteria isolated from the uterus of camelids with endometritis are Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, \u03b2-haemolytic Streptococci, Enterococcus, coagulase negative Staphyloccocus, Proteus spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Arcanobacter pyogenes\n[15], [26], [27], [28], [30], [31].

Also, females may assume the sternal position on command by the trainer, without regard to their ovarian status.

Ideally, breeding should only take place when a mature follicle has been detected on the ovary (12\u201318 mm in camels, 8\u201312 mm in llamas and alpacas); this is particularly important for females that are susceptible to infection.",

A case of abortion due to Bacillus cereus, an organism suspected to cause hemorrhagic disease, has been described in a 9-year-old dromedary female [58]. In this case, the fetal membranes had severe hemorrhagic necrotising placentitis accompanied by edema. Bacillus cereus was isolated from the placenta and different organs of the fetus (spleen, liver and intestines) [58]. Blue tongue abortion has been reported in camels in a disease called \u201cda-chonou\u201d in Africa [63].

Early and late fetal loss in these situations can reach 80% in affected animals (A. Anouassi, personal observation). The pathogenesis of trypanosome-associated abortions or premature births is not well understood. Severe compromise of the health of the female and severe anemia may be involved. Trypanosoma infection may also directly affect pituitary function and steroidogenesis (decreased progesterone production or increased cortisol production) leading to abortion [39]. Placentitis and placental edema have been diagnosed in our laboratory following outbreaks of trypanosomiasis (A. Tibary and A. Anouassi, clinical observations). Prevention of this disease can be effectively accomplished by regular preventive treatment with the pregnancy-safe trypanocide, melarsomine, a melaminophenylarsine compound (Cymelarsan\u00ae, Rhone Merieux) during the high-risk season [1], [73].",

The presence of seropositive wild camelids (guanacos and vicuna) is particularly important from an epidemiological perspective. The most frequently encountred serovars were copenhageni (serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae) and castellonis (serogroup Ballum) [84]. Alpacas were shown to react to L. interrogans serovar after vaccination. However this reaction is variable and immunity may be of short duration [83]. In North America, polyvalent vaccines commercialized for the bovine are used heavily in SAC in areas where the disease is endemic. Here, animals are vaccinated three or four times annually.",

Clients should be instructed to keep the placenta for proper examination. Detailed description of proper examination of the camelid placenta and its pathology is beyond the scope of this paper [12], [17]. Placental anatomy is very similar to that of the equine, with the exception that the left horn is always the pregnant-horn (largest) [12], [96]. The placenta should be examined as soon as possible following parturition. Weight of the placenta should be determined. The placenta is usually expelled inside\u2013out, with the allantoic surface exposed. It should be gently cleaned with cold water (to remove bedding, grass and soil), laid out flat and all surfaces examined. The umbilical cord should be of normal length. The amniotic sac and chorionic surface (red velvety surface) examined from the cervical \u201cstar\u201d to the tips of the horns on all sides. The fourth membrane (epithelion or epidermal membrane) should be translucent. Fixed and unfixed placental samples should be taken from different normal and abnormal sites and submitted for histopathology, histochemistry, and culture. Several morphological characteristics of the placenta may allow ruling out infectious causes (such as umbilical cord torsion, body pregnancy and twin pregnancies). Chronic infectious inflammations are generally easy to detect, as they will cause the placenta to be thick and leathery. Cytological evaluation of a contact smear may reveal inflammatory changes and pathologic organisms.",
