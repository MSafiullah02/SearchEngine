These patients received care in a common location with intensified nursing support and manual ventilation provided by students, and mortality declined. Intensive care units (ICUs) subsequently became a crucial component of hospital care.",

Examples of organ support are mechanical ventilation for respiratory dysfunction; inotropes, vasopressors, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation for cardiac dysfunction; dialysis for renal dysfunction; and hypothermia for brain protection after cardiac arrest. The efficacy of some organ support technologies is generally accepted on physiological grounds. For example, we assume that patients with septic shock or acute respiratory failure who do not receive vasopressors or mechanical ventilation will die.

Although patients with critical illness in this broad sense might be found throughout hospitals, many receive care in an ICU. Patients in an ICU generally fall into three main categories: those with acute organ dysfunction (including those whose ultimate outcome is unclear and thus receive long-term intensive organ support), those who have undergone a major procedure and are monitored in the peri-intervention period to prevent and detect acute organ dysfunction, and those whose trial of intensive care has failed and are receiving end-of-life care. Intensive care is delivered by an interdisciplinary team that includes not only nurses and physicians, but also respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, biotechnicians, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, and spiritual care providers. The daily practice of intensive care requires three related activities. First, clinicians have to simultaneously resuscitate, diagnose, and provide definitive care for acutely sick patients on a rapidly deteriorating but potentially reversible path towards organ dysfunction and death. Second, they have to prevent, recognise, and treat complications of treatments to support failing organs. Finally, clinicians' greatest challenge is to engage in decisions about the appropriate extent of life-supporting therapies for patients whose immediate death has been averted, but whose likelihood of returning to a meaningful survival is poor.",

For example, some jurisdictions subdivide ICUs into those that provide full organ support, and intermediate units, which provide some support and monitoring to patients at risk of further deterioration. In another example, ICUs were initially separated into surgical units treating postoperative patients and medical units treating non-operative patients. Subsequently, specialty-specific units were developed for patients with traumatic injuries or burns, or who had undergone neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, or solid organ transplantation. Although specialty ICUs might improve outcomes by reduction of practice variability and use of specialist nursing skills, US observational data suggest that risk-adjusted mortality is similar for patients treated in general ICUs and specialty ICUs, but might be worse when patients are looked after in specialty ICUs with less experience in their illness.6\n",

            "text": "A detailed picture of the global burden of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, is available from web-based resources such as WHO's Global Health Observatory. However, no reliable international comparative epidemiological data of critical illness syndromes such as acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple-organ dysfunction are available because of several fundamental challenges. First, critical illness syndromes cannot be diagnosed with one test, unlike HIV with serology or malaria with blood smears. Definitions for sepsis,10 nosocomial infections,11 and acute lung injury12 are based on clinical, laboratory, radiological, and physiological criteria, derived by consensus panels, and under continual debate and revision. Independent of the definitions' validity is their absence of reliability,13, 14 which makes comparative epidemiology challenging. Second, compared with chronic diseases like cancer, asthma, and tuberculosis, critical illness syndromes have a brief prodrome and high short-term mortality, which could be especially high in countries with few ICU resources. Such short time spans reduce the number of prevalent cases available for study at any given time, relative to chronic diseases. Third, critical illness is harder to study with existing administrative databases15 than are trauma or cardiovascular disease because it is not defined by a procedure or accurately captured by hospital coding. Finally, the epidemiology of critical illness and ICU resources is dependent on the availability and intensity of other health services. Even mortality after critical illness is related to a complex interplay between a clinical decision to limit intensive care and the consequences of the disease.16\n",

Observational studies of international practice have been done for sepsis,17 nosocomial infection,18 mechanical ventilation,19 and end-of-life care,20 and have been used to generate illness severity scores.21 These studies were done in ICUs by use of period prevalence data collection over short periods (snapshot data).

Incidence, prevalence, and prognosis are dependent on whether the study design considers measurement of population-based incidence, or incidence in those treated in ICUs. Other important sources of bias are the duration of follow-up for patients admitted (for one day vs the entire hospital stay), case definition, type of institution, study site (restricted to ICU or not), seasonal variability, and casemix.23 Results from US-based population studies from administrative data suggest a population-based incidence of 300 cases per 100 000 person-years for severe sepsis24 and 240 cases per 100 000 person-years for sepsis.25 When the setting is the ICU, most results show treated incidence of about ten cases per 100 ICU admissions.26 Others have reported a much higher incidence in settings with fewer ICU beds,27 probably indicating admission of very sick patients or exclusion of low-risk patients for postoperative monitoring from the denominator.17 Similarly, in population-based studies of acute lung injury, results show an incidence of 18,28 34,29 and 79 cases30 per 100 000 person-years in Scandinavia, Australia, and USA, respectively, with an estimated 74 500 deaths every year in the USA.30 This number exceeds the yearly number of deaths from breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, and asthma,31 and shows the underappreciated burden of critical illness to population health, at least in developed nations.",

Even the less ambitious goal of defining the global capacity to deliver critical care is difficult, in view of the absence of uniform definitions for an ICU bed, as noted in a study in which the results showed a five or more fold variation in ICU bed availability in eight developed countries.34 Nevertheless, meeting this goal is necessary to allocate health-system resources, improve the quality of care for critically ill patients, and plan for unexpected surges, such as during a pandemic. Definition of the global burden of critical illness would also provide impetus for initiatives to improve the outcomes of acutely ill adults in low-resource settings, such as the WHO's integrated management of adolescent and adult acute illness guidelines (IMAI). A model for this approach is a recent initiative to improve global surgical care that started with a study of the global burden of surgery.44, 45\n",

The results of one prominent randomised trial suggested that the combination of daily interruption of sedation and early exercise and mobilisation improved functional outcomes at hospital discharge.55 Whether this treatment is generalisable and feasible, and whether the effect is mainly driven by early exercise or by reduced sedation and delirium, remain to be seen. Similarly, strategies implemented after ICU discharge to decrease delayed morbidity remain elusive,56 as shown by a recent randomised trial that identified no benefit of a manual-based, self-directed physical rehabilitation programme, including nurse-led clinic follow-up and screening for psychological morbidity.56\nPanelLong-term sequelae of critical illness\n\u2022Physical morbidity\n\u2022Neuromuscular dysfunction (neuropathy, myopathy)\u2022Heterotopic ossification\u2022Frozen joints\u2022Compression neuropathies\u2022Pulmonary dysfunction\u2022Tracheostomy problems (excess scar tissue at skin site; subglottic stenosis)\n\u2022Neurocognitive and psychiatric morbidity\n\u2022Abnormalities in memory, attention, concentration and executive function\u2022Depression\u2022Post-traumatic stress disorder\u2022Anxiety\n\u2022Financial burdens and carer burnout\n",

First, clinicians might not recognise critical illness until organ dysfunction is already advanced.57 Attempts to augment clinicians' judgment of the severity of illness in hospital patients has led to the development of early warning scores, but these do not have enough sensitivity, reliability, and validity.58 Second, there are few effective specific treatments for heterogeneous critical illness syndromes. For example, in many statistically negative randomised trials of treatments for acute lung injury, only avoidance of injurious tidal volume ventilation reduces mortality.3 Even when an effective treatment exists, universal implementation has been difficult to achieve,59 indicating the challenges of translating complex care protocols delivered by interdisciplinary teams to the patient's bedside.60 This theme persists in examples of other effective supportive treatments, such as early aggressive resuscitation61 and early appropriate antibiotics62 in severe sepsis, enteral nutrition,63 and weaning from mechanical ventilation.64 Third, patients with critical-illness syndromes have variable severity of illness, burden of comorbidities, and baseline risk of mortality, all of which are broader than the narrow subset enrolled in randomised trials.65 The evidence base for critical care therapeutics, derived from few positive randomised trials, thus might not be generalisable to many patients cared for in ICUs.66\n",

However, these observational data do not prove that patients would benefit from regionalisation, and important barriers to the transfer of critically ill patients from low-volume to high-volume centres exist.75 Regionalisation of critical care services, like regionalisation of trauma services, will increase requirements for critical care services at high-volume centres. Most critical care services are organised with a trained intensivist managing the ICU, a model known as intensivist staffing, although this model is not universal. Most studies exploring the effects of this model come from the USA, the country with the most variation in intensive care delivery models. Data generally suggest that intensivists improve patient outcomes,76 possibly because they have the training and time commitment to provide complete care to very sick patients and their families, or because they are able to manage the critical care team most effectively. But this hypothesis does not lend itself to randomised trials, and the evidence is not uniform.77 Hospital physicians and surgeons, who are playing an increasing role in the management of patients in US acute-care hospitals, might share responsibility for critically ill patients in settings in which intensivist staffing is not possible.",

Determination of the global burden of critical-illness syndromes poses epidemiological challenges to separate the care for critically ill patients from the available intensive-care resources to treat them. Results from population-based studies in the developed world suggest that the burden of critical-illness syndromes is higher than generally appreciated and will increase as the population ages. Although intensive care capacity is scarce in the developing world, efforts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are emerging. Unlimited expansion of intensive care to meet the needs of an ageing population and handle the consequences of natural disasters, conflict, inadequate primary care, and high-risk treatments for very sick patients, will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint. To meet this challenge, the specialty of intensive care will need to measure better the global burden of critical illness and develop both preventive and therapeutic interventions for the sickest patient. These interventions will need to be scalable across health-care systems at all the world's latitudes.",
