CoVs occupy the entire subfamily of Coronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. Traditionally, CoVs were classified into three groups depending on their antigenic and genetic properties (Brian and Baric, 2005). However, these groups have been recently replaced with four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. The first two genera include only mammalian CoVs, while all avian CoVs are members of the other two genera (de Groot et al., 2012).",

            "text": "CoVs infect a wide diversity of animal and bird species causing respiratory, enteric, neurologic and hepatic disorders. Since SARS-CoV was identified in 2003, a significant increase in the number of emerging CoVs has been shown in people and animals as a result of the growing interest in CoV research and the development of improved diagnostic tools (Woo et al., 2009; Peck et al., 2015). The accumulated information has confirmed the ability of CoVs to adapt new tissue tropisms, to jump host-species barriers and to acclimatize variable ecological niches (Decaro et al., 2010b). These abilities were believed to be attributed to: (1) the high mutation rate (a single mutation/genome/round of replication) caused by low fidelity of the viral RNA polymerase (Drake and Holland, 1999), and (2) the exceptional tendency for homologous recombination mediated by random template switching during RNA replication (Woo et al., 2006; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008). Cross-species transmission of CoVs was previously recorded for many CoVs [e.g. SARS-CoV in palm civet and human beings (Song et al., 2005); Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in camels and people (Drosten et al., 2014)]. Bovine CoV (BCoV) represents an excellent example of a CoV that extensively crosses the interspecies barrier. Several bovine-like CoVs were identified as aetiologic pathogens of enteric and/or respiratory diseases in a diverse spectrum of ruminant species (Saif, 2010), dogs (Decaro et al., 2007; Erles et al., 2007; Lorusso et al., 2009) and even human beings (Zhang et al., 1994).",

            "text": "BCoVs are commonly identified in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of healthy cattle, and contribute to different disease syndromes (Fulton et al., 2015). The virus is involved as a major cause of calf diarrhoea (CD) during the first 3 weeks of life in both dairy and beef cattle herds (Boileau and Kapil, 2010). High mortalities are mostly attributed to BCoV infections because they affect both small and large intestines, destroying villi and leading to severe, often bloody, diarrhoea (Torres-Medina et al., 1985). Enteric BCoV infection is also associated with winter dysentery (WD) in adult dairy cattle, causing dramatic decrease in milk production and significant economic losses (Natsuaki et al., 2007). Respiratory tract infection in growing (2\u201316 weeks of age) and feedlot calves has been frequently attributed to BCoV (Storz et al., 2000; Decaro et al., 2008b; Saif, 2010). The widespread distribution of BCoV could be explained by two main factors: (1) rapid transmission of the virus via faecal\u2013oral and respiratory routes (Heckert et al., 1990; Decaro et al., 2008a), and (2) existence of carrier animals within infected herds. These carriers shed the virus in faeces, particularly during the stress of winter season and parturition, and serve as a source of infection to their neonates and reservoirs for reinfection on the farm (Carman and Hazlett, 1992).",

Due to their close antigenic and genetic relatedness, members of Betacoronavirus 1 appear as host-range variants rather than separate viruses. It has been concluded that they may originate as a result of genetic recombination and interspecies transmission events (Zhang et al., 1994; Lau et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2012). For instance, HCoV-OC43 likely evolved from ancestral BCoV strains that crossed the interspecies barrier and established an infection in human beings around 1890 (Vijgen et al., 2005; Vijgen et al., 2006).",

Most of these viruses have demonstrated extensive biologic, antigenic and genetic similarities with BCoV and consequently they were termed as bovine-like CoVs (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995). Experimental transmission of bovine-like CoVs to gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived cattle calves suggest that cattle may be reservoirs for CoV strains to infect other domestic and wild ruminants and vice versa, in a process that helps maintaince and evolution of CoVs in these species (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995; Hasoksuz et al., 2007). It has been proposed that the broad host range of BCoV may be attributed to the presence of haemagglutinin-esterase protein that enables the virus to bind to different cell types (Saif, 2010).\n\n",

The population of water buffalo in the world was estimated to be 172 million head with 95% living in Asia (mostly in India, China and Pakistan), 2.4% in South America (principally in Brazil), 2.3% in Africa (only in Egypt), 0.3% in Europe and 0.02% in Australia (Borghese, 2011).",

Seven faecal samples of diarrhoeic buffalo calves showed haemagglutinating activity that was suppressed by BCoV-specific antiserum (Muniiappa et al., 1985). In the early 1990s, bovine-like CoVs were detected in the faeces of suckling buffalo calves with profuse diarrhoea in Egypt using monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoperoxidase assays (Abd El-Karim et al., 1990). The CoV particles were identified in two further studies in Egypt using negative-contrast transmission electron microscopy (EM) in 20 and 55.2% of the faecal samples collected from diarrhoeic buffalo calves, and 8.3 and 19.1% of the faecal samples collected from apparently healthy buffalo calves, respectively (Byomi et al., 1996; Abd El-Rahim, 1997). The epidemiological data presented by the Tri-national Health Research Project, USAID, indicated that CoV is the second most-common pathogen causing diarrhoea in buffalo calves in Egypt with a prevalence rate of 37.7% (Saleh, 1994; Garbe et al., 1995).",

Bovine-like CoVs were identified in the intestinal contents of buffalo calves with severe diarrhoea (two dead and 17 alive) by conventional and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. A virus strain (designated as 179/07-11) was isolated with HRT-18 cells, producing the typical cytopathic effects of BCoV. This strain shared many similarities with BcoVs including: (1) haemagglutination of mouse erythrocytes, (2) receptor-destroying enzymatic activity, (3) cross-reactivity with BCoV antisera in immunofluorescence (IF) assay, and (4) genomic organization. However, the inability of strain 179/07-11 to replicate in MDBK cells and to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, along with the existence of considerable genetic distance between both bovine and buffalo strains, suggested the assignment of strain 179/07-11 as a prototype of a novel host-range variant of BCoV (named as bubaline CoV) (Decaro et al., 2008c). Four further bubaline CoV strains were isolated afterwards and all showed similar biologic and antigenic characteristics to the prototype strain 179/07-11. Nevertheless, the genetic analysis showed that three of these strains were closely related to the prototype strain whereas the fourth shared higher genetic similarity to recent BCoV reference strains (Decaro et al., 2010a). It is proposed that the bubaline CoV may be originated from interspecies transmission of a BCoV strain; however, no cattle, sheep or goat contact to the water buffalo herd was demonstrated at the time of the outbreak.",

Nevertheless, the nature of the three accessory proteins that located between spike (S) and envelop (E) varies distinctively. The 4.9 kDa protein of BCoV was replaced with 2.9 kDa protein in BufCoV HKU26, a result of premature stop codon, and the 4.8 kDa protein was replaced with 3.2 and 5.1 kDa proteins in strains B1-24F and B1-28F, respectively, a result of frameshift deletion mutation (Lau et al., 2016).",

However, the prevalence of infection was mostly low and of minor importance. Among 545 diarrhoeic lambs originated from 12 sheep flocks in southern Idaho and western Montana, USA, bovine-like CoVs were detected in lambs of only one flock (Harp et al., 1981). As well, CoVs were detected in six (out of 98; 6.1%) dead lambs but not in healthy lambs and ewes in Chile (Reinhardt et al., 1995). Two reports from Spain and Turkey demonstrated that Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Escherichia coli and rotavirus \u2013 but not CoV \u2013 were the leading causes of neonatal diarrhoea and mortalities in domestic sheep (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996; Ozmen et al., 2006). A nationwide screening of BCoV-specific antibodies in Swedish sheep has demonstrated that 19% of all sera samples were positive. However, it was expected that these antibodies originated from contact with infected cattle faeces rather than a natural infection with bovine-like CoV (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999).",

Antibodies to the recombinant protein were identified in 98.3 and 100% of the tested sera samples using IF and VN assays. Immunization of mice with the recombinant N proteins of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV has confirmed minimal cross-antigenicity between both viruses in Western blot (WB) and VN assays (Woo et al., 2016). These results demonstrate that a Betacoronavirus, other than MERS-CoV, is circulating among DCs in different countries of Middle East and may contribute to pathological conditions of diarrhoea, particularly in camel calves.\n\n",

These CoVs included two Betacoronaviruses: MERS-CoV (group C) and camel HKU23-CoVs (group A), and one Alphacoronavirus (similar to human CoV 229E). All CoV-positive samples except three were nasal swabs, which indicates that the respiratory tract is the major shedding portal for CoVs in DCs. Regardless of MERS-CoV that has been detected in DCs in many countries worldwide, the HKU-23-CoV was detected in DCs in Dubai short time earlier (Woo et al., 2014) and a closely related camelid Alphacoronavirus was isolated from alpacas in the USA in 2007 (Crossley et al., 2010; Crossley et al., 2012). The high prevalence of CoVs in the collected samples, the frequent co-infections and the lack of symptoms in most CoV-positive cases propose that these CoVs are enzootic in DCs, at least in Saudi Arabia, and that they may play an important role in CoV ecology.",

Sick crias developed clinical symptoms similar to BCoV-infected cattle calves with variable degrees of severity and frequent deaths (Cebra et al., 2003; Cebra, 2007). A single alpaca CoV (designated ACoV-00-1381) was isolated from the diarrhoeic samples by propagation in HRT-18 G cells. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the complete ACoV-00-1381 genome revealed close homology (>99.5%) with two BCoV strains involved in shipping fever pneumonia and enteritis in feedlot calves: LUN and ENT, respectively (Storz et al., 1996; Chouljenko et al., 2001; Fig. 1). A common ancestral origin of alpaca CoV and both strains of BCoV was proposed (Jin et al., 2007).",

In another wild animal park in north central Ohio, episodes of watery diarrhoea in white-tailed deer were also monitored throughout 1994. CoV particles were identified in faecal samples collected from three samber deer and one white-tailed deer using immunocytochemistry and antigen detection ELISA. Two CoV isolates (KI-D2 from samber deer and WTD from white-tailed deer) were recovered in the Cariboo HRT-18 cell line. Both isolates demonstrated close relationship with several BCoV strains causing CD and WD based on similar biologic (haemagglutination and receptor-destroying activities) and antigenic reactivity in HI, VN, IF and WB tests (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995). Analysis of the full genome sequence of both isolates (either cell culture-adapted or gnotobiotic calf-passaged) confirmed the marked similarity with BCoVs, particularly LUN and ENT strains isolated in 1998 (Fig. 1b), with no specific genetic markers that can discriminate KI-D2 and WTD from BCoV strains (Alekseev et al., 2008). Additionally, 30 sera samples were acquired from free-range healthy white-tailed deer located in a third wild animal park in Ohio. Two samples (6.6%) were seropositive against both isolates and several BCoV strains in IF assay (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Similar to domestic cattle, wild bovidae have also been associated with CoV-induced scours in calves and WD in adults. During the winter season of 1979\u20131980, an outbreak of diarrhoea occurred among a group of musk oxen (Ovibox moschatus) in Whipsnade zoological park in Bedfordshire, UK. CoVs were identified in the faecal samples collected from diseased animals using EM. Unfortunately, virus strains were not isolated or characterized due to technical limitations (Chasey et al., 1984). CoVs are also among the common pathogens isolated from bison (Bison bison) calves with diarrhoea (Haigh et al., 2002). However, the actual prevalence of CoVs in bison is underestimated because bison mask the clinical signs of the disease syndrome (Berezowski, 2001). CoVs were also demonstrated in the faeces of adult wisent \u2013 European bison (Bison bonasus) suffering from severe diarrhoea in the National Zoo of South Korea. The outbreak started in a wisent, albeit no cattle were housed in the zoo and no cattle farms existed in the vicinity, and spread to other wild ruminants in the park. All identified CoVs were quite similar in terms of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence. They also showed high level of genetic relationship (99.4\u201399.5%) to BCoVs isolated in South Korea after 2004, particularly BCoV-0501 and BCoV-0502 strains (Fig. 1b). It was concluded that all bovine-like CoVs characterized in this study were replicates of a single strain that has no restricted host specificity. This strain may originate, via an unclear pathway, from the same ancestor of BCoV-0501 and BCoV-0502 strains of cattle (Chung et al., 2011). More recently, a serological study was conducted in a population of wood bison (B. bison athabascae) that were reintroduced in the wild in southwestern Youkon, Canada since 1988. Antibodies to BCoV were demonstrated in only two out of 31 (7%) of the animals tested (Harms et al., 2019).",

Four animals (two adults and two calves) were lost and bovine-like CoVs were identified in the faeces of affected animals using EM and ELISA. Attempts to propagate these viruses in HRT-18 cell culture were unsuccessful. Additionally, experimental infection of gnotobiotic cattle calves with the faecal materials of dead waterbucks did not reveal clinical reproduction of the disease. The inoculated calves did not shed the virus in their faeces, did not develop antibody responses and were not immune against experimental challenge with BCoV field strain (Chasey et al., 1984). Infection of waterbuck with bovine-like CoVs was further confirmed in another epizootic outbreak of diarrhoea that occurred in Ohio wild animal park in 1993 and 1994. The aetiologic virus (designated KI-WB) has been isolated in cell culture and has close biologic and antigenic relation to BCoVs (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995). Unlike the virus detected in the UK in 1982, the gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves experimentally infected with KI-WB strain developed signs of acute diarrhoea and excreted the virus in their faeces and nasal secretions.",

It is generally accepted today that bovine-like CoVs are host-range variants of BCoV, which is crossing the interspecies barriers on a regular basis. Transmission of BCoV variants from cattle to other ruminants and vice versa allows persistence of the infection in nature, recurrent emergence of epidemics and continuous evolution of the virus. Wild ruminants, in particular, are not confined to discrete geographic regions and are always moving to seek new pastures, to escape from predators, and to find mates. Human activities, including \u2013 but not restricted to \u2013 deforestation, over-hunting and game farming, also force wild animals to change habitats. Continuous movement of wild animals promotes virus transmission to new terrestrial areas, and, importantly, provides a window for the virus to adapt to new hosts and to develop into novel strains.",

Phylograms were constructed by MEGA 7.0 software using the maximum likelihood method. The strength of the tree was evaluated by bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. Bootstrap values are shown at the branch nodes of the tree. Bovine-like coronaviruses are grouped according to the type of animal(s), state or country of origin, and year of identification as indicated in the brackets at the right side. The scale bar at the bottom indicates the number of nucleotide changes per site.",
