Commonly called sumac, Rhus consists of approximately 250 individual species of flowering plants, with six species found (four endemics) in China. Like most sumacs, Rhus chinensis is a dioecious shrub that can reach 8 m in height. It bears odd pinnately compound leaves and creamy\u2010white flowers. The fruits (drupes) are orange or red in color at maturity and contain one seed (Barkley, 1937; Miller et al., 2001; Tianlu and Barfod, 2008). The species grows in areas with marginal agricultural capacity, and is widely distributed in temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions, including China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India (Rayne and Mazza, 2007; Ren et al., 2008).",

Numerous curative properties are ascribed to different parts of this tree, namely root, bark, stem, leaf, fruit, flowers, seed and gall (Table 1). The leaves and the root are used as depuratives, stimulating blood circulation. Its decoction is used in the treatment of hemoptysis, inflammations, laryngitis, snakebite, stomachache and traumatic fractures (Duke and Ayensu, 1985; Kao, 1988; Ouyang et al., 2008). The ripe fruits of this plant have long been used in Asia to treat dysentery and diarrhea, as well as other gastrointestinal disorders (Kala, 2005; Pradhan and Badola, 2008; Bose et al., 2008). The fruit produces a sour juice when boiled with water. This juice, when diluted with water or/and mixed with raw eggs, treats diarrhea and dysentery (Pradhan and Badola, 2008). It is used for the treatment of colic (Chopra et al., 1986) and also as a food preservative (Pradhan and Badola, 2008). The seed is used in the treatment of cough, dysentery, fever, jaundice, malaria and rheumatism (Duke and Ayensu, 1985; Abbasi et al., 2009).",

It is a frequent ingredient in polyherbal prescriptions for diabetes mellitus (Duke and Ayensu, 1985). It has hemostatic effects, often used to promote clotting following traumatic injuries and to treat burns (Yeung, 1985). It is also used to treat rectal and intestinal cancer, prolapse of the rectum, seminal enuresis and hemorrhoids (Yeung, 1985; Gao et al., 2000). In addition to its antiphlogistic and antiseptic uses for treating diseases such as persistent cough, Galla chinensis also has antiinflammatory properties (Tian et al., 2009). It is also used to counteract ulcers in the mouth and to treat fever and malaria (Duke and Ayensu, 1985; Gao et al., 2000).",

Structures containing 1 to 14 galloyl residues result from such processes, yielding tri\u2010, tetra\u2010, penta\u2010, hepta\u2010 and nonagalloylglucose, and others (Xiang et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2009b).

Tian et al. (2009a) tested the antioxidant activity of gallotannins with different polarities and found that all of the consecutive extracts of Galla chinensis possessed remarkable antioxidant activity. For example, DPPH radical scavenging activity, EC50 were in the sequence ethyl acetate (1.22 \u00b5g/mL) > ether (1.44 \u00b5g/mL) > ethanol (1.55 \u00b5g/mL) > water (2.11 \u00b5g/mL). Generally, all fractions showed better capacity to scavenge free radicals than the controls, BHT and TROLOX. The same results trend was observed with ferric reducing activity. Antioxidant activity increased when the polarity of extracts decreased, suggesting that extracts with weaker polarities contained higher molecular weight tannins, and thus had stronger antioxidant effects. Aware of this finding, (Tian et al. 2009b) isolated different gallotannins, containing 1\u201310 galloylglucoses (GG), from Galla chinensis and investigated their antioxidant activities in the above systems. Generally, gallotannins of high degrees of galloylation (5\u201310 GGs) had stronger antioxidant activities than those of low degrees of galloylation (1\u20134 GGs).The same conclusion was drawn in earlier work by Yokozawa et al.

Pentagalloylglucose has been shown to exhibit in vivo anticancer effects against prostate cancer (Hu et al., 2008; Kuo et al., 2009), lung cancer (Huh et al., 2005) and sarcoma (Miyamoto et al., 1987), and in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth and/or invasion of breast cancer, leukemia, melanoma and liver cancer (Zhang et al., 2009). Pentagalloylglucose can exert anticancer activity via the inhibition of angiogenesis (Lee et al., 2004; Huh et al., 2005) and invasion of melanoma cells in metastasis (Ho et al., 2002). In vitro studies showed that pentagalloylglucose significantly inhibited the proliferation and tube formation of bFGF\u2010treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with an IC50 of 8 \u00b5m (Huh et al., 2005).
