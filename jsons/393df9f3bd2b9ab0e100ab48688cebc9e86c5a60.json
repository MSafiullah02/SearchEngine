The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination. It has been clearly documented that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals. One cannot estimate mortality rates without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population. This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals so they can be properly treated, monitored and tracked. However, accurate estimation of the infection rate, locally, geographically and nationally is important independently. These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state, national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society. The decisions facing policy makers are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic where the infection rate is low, middle stages where the rate is rapidly climbing, and later stages where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate. In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods to both estimate infection rates and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates. These estimates may provide significant cost reductions for testing in rural communities, third world countries and other situations where the cost of testing is expensive or testing is not widely available. As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels.",

The challenge of rapid testing has created an outstanding community response from industry and academic centers producing tests to diagnose and identify infected patients. The majority of these tests rely on PCR based techniques that are very well established. Newer tests are based on isothermal amplification and most recently CRISPR based methods using CAS-13.

We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy of the approximate counting procedure with both theoretical analysis and simulation.

We note that Algorithm 0 is the natural approach that has been recently used in Nebraska with pool size s=5 without optimizing the choice of the pool size to reduce the number of tests. To be fair to this algorithm, sensitivity of testing in very large pools may be reduced without proper optimization and therefore we present Algorithm 0 (small pool size) below for completeness (Fig 2) . .

In this paper we described a cost effective application of approximate counting methods to estimate infection rates. These methods can help make crucial and rapid policy decisions with reduced investment, especially in early or late stages of the epidemic or in underserved communities, e.g., rural counties or third world countries. We also reviewed several identification algorithms and introduced new ones that provide good to modest improvements in the number of tests for different infection rates. In some cases our methods reduce the number of tests by two fold which is significant.",

We have not considered multiplex-PCR as an alternative. There are newer diagnostic procedures based on CRISPR (CAS-13) under development. These methods vary in sensitivity, availability and cost. In theory, it is also possible to barcode every sample with a genomic tag, pool the tagged sequences into a very large multiplexed DNA sample and submit the sample for high throughput sequencing. Standard procedures would allow us to read the sequences and allocate any detected viral DNA to the appropriate individual using tags. Error correcting procedures can be deployed to produce an efficient library of tags. However, high throughput sequencing presents its own challenges and therefore we focused on pooling samples and testing using more traditional approaches. These established methods might also be easier to deploy in third world countries or rural communities that do not have access to high throughput solutions.",
