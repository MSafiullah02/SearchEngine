A number of countries have applied thermography at international airports in order to detect infectious passengers. A previous study revealed that the positive predictive value (PPV) varied from 3.5% to 65.4%.4 This low PPV indicates the limited effectiveness of thermography in detecting early-stage influenza symptoms.",

Therefore, in order to achieve more accurate screening, heart and respiratory rates are used as new parameters for screening. We conducted non-contact influenza screening within 30 s using the newly developed screening system. The system is operated by the screening program through a linear discriminant analysis using non-contact derived variables, i.e., palmar pulse determined using a laser Doppler blood-flow meter, respiration rate determined using a 10-GHz microwave radar, and average facial temperature measured by thermography. We have previously demonstrated the possibility of non-contact determination of exposure to toxic conditions via a 1215-MHz microwave radar,5, 6 which has been investigated for use in locating human subjects buried under earthquake rubble,7, 8, 9 in order to prevent secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions. Exposure to a toxin, namely, lipopolysaccharide,10 was determined by linear discriminant analysis using non-contact derived variables in an animal experiment.5 In a previous study, we assessed the performance of the newly developed non-contact screening system in a laboratory from an engineering viewpoint.11 In the present paper, for seasonal influenza (2008\u20132009) patients and normal control subjects, we investigate whether the newly developed screening system can distinguish influenza patients from normal control subjects at the Japan Self-defense Forces Central Hospital.",

The Doppler laser probe is used to measure the palmar pulse.
