            "text": "Diarrhea is responsible for the death of an estimated 500,000 children per year worldwide with the greatest mortality occurring in developing countries (Kirk et al., 2015; Kotloff et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016). Diarrhea in most of these children is caused by a mere handful of infectious agents (Kirk et al., 2015; Kotloff et al., 2013). In particular, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is responsible for over 81 million cases of diarrhea per year of which 17 million cases are diagnosed in children (Kirk et al., 2015). Typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (tEPEC) is a common bacterial cause of diarrhea in children and, compared to other common enteropathogens, is associated with the highest hazard of death (Kotloff et al., 2013). While tEPEC is largely undisputed as a cause of diarrhea, the pathogenicity of atypical EPEC (aEPEC), which lack the plasmid responsible for expression of bundle forming pili, is confounded by frequent observation in children with and without signs of diarrhea (Barletta et al., 2011; Enserink et al., 2014; Estrada-Garcia et al., 2009). A rising incidence of aEPEC infection in both developing and developed countries has renewed controversy over the pathogenicity of aEPEC in children (Hu and Torres, 2015).",

            "text": "Similar to children in developing countries, there exists a high mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease in young kittens residing in animal shelters across the United States and elsewhere (Ghosh et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2008). We recently identified that shelter kittens have a high prevalence of aEPEC carriage (Ghosh et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2017). The kitten carriage mirrors observations of aEPEC carriage in children by being observed in both sick and healthy individuals but with a significantly higher bacterial burden in individuals with diarrhea as compared to those with asymptomatic infection (Barletta et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2017). For both children and kittens it remains unclear as to what extent, and under what conditions, or by what mechanisms aEPEC serves as a primary cause of diarrhea. It seems likely that some combination of bacterial and host factors enable aEPEC to access the intestinal epithelium and thereupon promote pathogenicity in some hosts and not others. Directly pathogenic effects of EPEC are believed to commence when these bacteria attach to and efface the microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells and inject effector proteins into the epithelial cells resulting in disrupted regulation of paracellular permeability and ion transport mechanisms (Glotfelty et al., 2014; Hu and Torres, 2015; McNamara et al., 2001; Thanabalasuriar et al., 2010). While the cellular mechanisms have been well characterized in vitro, the pathogenesis of the infection in vivo is less well understood. Kittens with diarrhea-related death which test positive for aEPEC have more severe inflammation and epithelial injury within the small intestine and more often require parenteral fluid therapy compared to kittens with diarrhea-related death and negative test results for aEPEC (Watson et al., 2017).",

Specifically, prevalence of a major commensal species, Enterococcus hirae, was replaced by Enterococcus faecalis. Experimental animal models of EPEC infection similarly suggest a strong influence of the microbiome and specific members of the microbiome on disease outcome (Vong et al., 2015; Walsham et al., 2016; Wlodarska et al., 2011). Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine if aEPEC is sufficient to cause diarrhea or intestinal dysfunction in kittens with experimentally-induced infection and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility. We additionally examined the effect of a probiotic formulation of feline Enterococcus hirae on the observed manifestations of aEPEC-induced disease. Our rationale was that identification of aEPEC as a primary cause of intestinal disease in kittens could provide a unique opportunity for development of life-saving treatment strategies for both kittens and possibly children with aEPEC infection. In particular, demonstration of a positive impact of commensal bacteria in treatment or prevention of aEPEC-associated disease would be of immediate benefit to improving the burden of diarrhea in infected kittens.",

            "text": "As this study was an exploratory study on a bacterium of unknown pathogenicity in cats, we included 3 serologically and genetically distinct isolates of feline aEPEC in our experimental infection. Our rationale for selecting these 3 aEPEC was that they were each isolated from a kitten that died with diarrhea (Watson et al., 2017), selecting 3 should increase the likelihood of infection, and exposure to multiple isolates reflects a more natural setting of infection. Each isolate was confirmed to be E. coli by means of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) (VITEK\u00ae MS; Biom\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) and identified as aEPEC by demonstrating the presence of eae and absence of genes encoding bundle-forming pilus and Shiga-toxins 1 and 2 (DebRoy and Maddox, 2001). Isolates were stored in 50% lysogeny broth (LB)-glycerol at \u221280 \u00b0C. Prior to use in experimental infection, each isolate was grown separately overnight on LB agar at 37 \u00b0C. A single colony from each plate was individually suspended in LB broth and grown overnight. The following morning, an overnight culture of each isolate was individually sub-cultured at 1:25 concentration in LB and incubated on a shaker platform at 37 \u00b0C until an OD600 of 0.4 was obtained (\u02dc 108 CFU/ml). To prepare the inoculum for each kitten, a one-milliliter aliquot of each isolate (3 ml total) was combined in a conical tube and centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was reconstituted with 100 \u03bcl of sterile water. The 100 \u03bcl aliquot of aEPEC was then added to \u00bc teaspoon of canned cat food which was offered to each kitten and promptly ingested. A tandem mixture of the isolates was simultaneously prepared for serial dilutions and plate counting to confirm the CFU/ml of the inoculum used for infection.",

We used qPCR data obtained from amplification of eae from the fecal DNA of naturally infected kittens and its application to a previously developed standard curve for the relationship between the cycle threshold (Ct) of eae and CFU of aEPEC (Watson et al., 2017) to estimate the burden of aEPEC carriage in kittens with diarrhea. To determine the influence of the gastric environment on survival of aEPEC, growth of the aEPEC isolates was quantified under conditions designed to simulate the volume, acidity, ion composition, and pepsin concentration of feline gastric contents (Chandler et al., 1997). Briefly, a mixture of all 3 aEPEC isolates was inoculated into each of two 50 ml conical tubes containing 5 milliters of buffer. The buffer consisted of 2 solutions (0.2 M KCl and 0.2 M HCl) that were combined to achieve a target pH of 2 followed by the addition of 0.05 mg/ml pepsin. To replicate the vehicle intended for use in delivery of the experimental aEPEC inoculum, \u00bc teaspoon of canned cat food (Hill\u2019s\u00ae Science Diet a/d) was included in each tube. The solution was incubated in a shaking water bath (30 RPM) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h to simulate gastric temperature and emptying time (Chandler et al., 1997). Serial dilutions of the original inoculum and aliquots obtained after \u201cinfection\u201d of the simulated gastric environments were plated and bacteria colonies counted to establish the CFU/ml of aEPEC prior to and after incubation in the gastric environment. Isolates obtained post-incubation were not identified by pulsotype or serotype.",

            "text": "Results of this study have demonstrated that kittens experimentally-infected with aEPEC have sustained shedding of aEPEC and in quantities similar to that observed in naturally infected kittens (Watson et al., 2017) and children (Barletta et al., 2011) with diarrhea. A major objective of this study was to determine the pathogenicity of aEPEC in kittens. In the absence of an imposed disruption of the intestinal microbiota, healthy purpose-bred kittens (Group A) remained clinically asymptomatic after experimental aEPEC infection. In contrast, kittens pretreated with antibiotics to disrupt the intestinal microbiota (Group B) demonstrated significant increases in fecal scores and wet weights consequent to administration of aEPEC. These observations suggest an important role of the intestinal microbiota in influencing susceptibility to disease associated with aEPEC administration. These findings are similar to those observed in mice infected with the EPEC related pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, where pretreatment with antibiotics increases the severity of infection and this is associated with greater numbers of bacteria adhering to the epithelium (Wlodarska et al., 2011). We have previously shown that aEPEC adhere to the intestinal epithelium of kittens that have died from diarrhea (Ghosh et al., 2013; Nicklas et al., 2010; Watson et al., 2017). However, we did not examine adherence of aEPEC in the kittens in this study because they did not undergo euthanasia. Increases in intestinal water loss by these kittens could reflect a non-specific effect of E. coli administration, or alternatively the instigation of diarrheal mechanisms dependent on bacterial attachment. These mechanisms include inactivation of SGLT-1, inhibition of both NHE3 and the Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchanger SLC26A3, and internalization of aquaporins, resulting in impaired sodium, chloride, and water absorption by intestinal epithelial cells (Dean et al., 2006; Gill et al., 2007; Guttman et al., 2007; Hodges et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In an effort to gain further mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of aEPEC carriage in kittens, but within the confines of a non-terminal study, we quantified intestinal absorptive and barrier function in vivo in kittens before and after experimental infection with aEPEC. These studies were conducted by oral administration of D-xylose and iohexol followed by measurement of their appearance in serum. The results demonstrated a significant effect of aEPEC administration on intestinal absorption and permeability. D-xylose is an exogenous monosaccharide whose oral absorption requires transport across the intestinal epithelium transcellularly via the sodium-glucose transporter SGLT-1 (Alvarado, 1966) or via passive diffusion (Ohkohchi et al., 1986). The concentration of D-xylose in serum following oral administration reflects the absorptive capacity of the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, our measurement of lower serum concentrations of D-xylose after, compared to before, aEPEC infection supports the onset of significant intestinal malabsorption. While we did not perform a histological examination of the intestines of kittens in this study, intestinal malabsorption could reflect a non-specific effect of E. coli administration, or alternatively the functional consequence of a number of cell-based mechanisms of EPEC pathogenesis including effacement of microvilli (Moon et al., 1983), villus blunting due to loss of epithelial cell numbers (Fagundes-Neto et al., 1997), or a specific inhibitory effect of EPEC effector proteins on SGLT-1 (Dean et al., 2006). It is also possible that aEPEC promoted changes in intestinal motility or in the host microbial community composition that negatively influenced the absorption of D-xylose. This study also demonstrated that kittens experimentally infected with aEPEC had significantly decreased intestinal permeability to iohexol. Iohexol is a nonionic, water-soluble, radiocontrast agent whose oral absorption requires passive diffusion through paracellar pathways between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells (Frias et al., 2012; Gerova et al., 2011). Our observation that intestinal permeability to iohexol decreased following aEPEC infection in kittens was somewhat unexpected as cell culture studies show that tEPEC increases tight junction permeability by injecting effector proteins (e.g. EspF, EspG1/G2, NleA and Map) into host cells in vitro (Glotfelty et al., 2014; McNamara et al., 2001; Thanabalasuriar et al., 2010). It is possible that the decrease in intestinal permeability observed in vivo in these kittens reflects a non-specific effect of E. coli, or the presence of additional influences of aEPEC on epithelial surface area. For example, children with attaching and effacing E. coli often have villus blunting which reduces the overall surface area of paracellular pathway (Fagundes-Neto et al., 1997; Hyun et al., 1995). Recent studies of infants with environmental enteropathy demonstrate that total epithelial surface area has a greater influence on translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than does the presence of overt epithelial defects and tight junction leakage that were documented using confocal laser endomicroscopy (Kelly et al., 2016).",

We have previously established that Enterococcus hirae is the predominant mucosa-adherent enterococci species residing in the small intestine of healthy kittens (Ghosh et al., 2013; Nicklas et al., 2010). Moreover, in kittens with terminal illness, in which aEPEC colonization of the epithelium is prevalent, E. hirae is replaced by increases in mucosal colonization with genotypically diverse, virulent, and antimicrobial-resistant E. faecalis (Ghosh et al., 2013). This observation is strikingly similar to studies of C. rodentium in interleukin 22 receptor knockout (IL-22ra1\u2212/\u2212) mice where opportunistic mucosal colonization by virulent E. faecalis promotes a greater burden of attachment of C. rodentium to the intestinal epithelium (Pham et al., 2014). Results of this study demonstrated that a probiotic formulation of E. hirae was highly effective in promoting intestinal colonization and fecal shedding of live E. hirae during administration. In kittens with experimental aEPEC carriage, E. hirae appeared to exert its most significant influence by promoting a decrease in intestinal permeability. This decrease in permeability may indicate an enhancement of the barrier function promoted by E. hirae. While the specific mechanism of this observation was not established by this study, others have shown that the lipoteichoic acid of E. hirae is able to protect against loss of epithelial tight junction function induced by TNF-\u03b1 (Miyauchi et al., 2008). Additionally, E. hirae can limit the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by LPS (Arokiyaraj et al., 2014; Miyauchi et al., 2008) and exerts bactericidal effects against numerous pathogens including E. coli and E. faecalis (Miyauchi et al., 2008).",

Additional studies will be needed to answer this question. Our study utilized a relatively small sample size (n = 8) of kittens in each group. These samples sizes were further diminished by inclusion within each group of a subset of kittens receiving either an E. hirae probiotic or placebo. Despite these conservative numbers, statistically significant differences were disclosed for each of the major objectives of the study. Kittens pretreated with antibiotics had decreases in intestinal absorption and permeability of D-xylose and iohexol, respectively. However, these measurements were not significantly different due to a higher variability in the data collected from kittens that had received treatment with antibiotics. Differences in the baseline values between the kittens in Group A and Group B made it difficult to assess a comparison of severity of intestinal barrier dysfunction between kittens with a \u201cnormal\u201d versus disrupted bacterial flora prior to aEPEC infection, respectively. Nonetheless, these studies support that a \u201cnormal\u201d intestinal microbiota may be a strong contributing factor to maintaining an asymptomatic aEPEC carriage. To limit the number of animals used, we did not measure intestinal function in an uninfected group of kittens to control for any extraneous effect of time (11\u201312 days) between the pre- and post-infection measurements of intestinal absorption or permeability. Despite attempts to screen fecal samples from queens and kittens for aEPEC prior to their purchase, a subset of kittens in each experimental group was determined to be carrying a \u201cvendor-origin\u201d aEPEC prior to inclusion in this study. No alternate source of kittens designated as specific pathogen free from aEPEC existed at the time of this study. The impact of preexisting aEPEC on the results of experimental aEPEC infection in these kittens was impossible to ascertain due to the low number of kittens falling into each combination of experimental variables. However, mice infected with C. rodentium can develop an IgG-dependent acquired immunity and decreased colonization upon re-infection (Maaser et al., 2004). Accordingly it is possible that pathogenic effects of aEPEC in kittens with prior infection was diminished in this study.",

            "text": "In summary, results of this study identify aEPEC as a potentially influential pathogen in kittens. An ability of aEPEC to promote intestinal malabsorption may explain the association of the infection with increased odds of mortality in kittens and children with diarrhea (Kotloff et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2017). The resident intestinal microbiota have an important impact on disease susceptibility, which may in part explain why some kittens and children with the infection remain asymptomatic while others are susceptible to diarrhea (Barletta et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2017). Fortification of the intestinal microbiota with commensal E. hirae has a potential to ameliorate the effect of aEPEC in kittens and is worthy of further study in susceptible populations.",
