A long-standing concern for the introduction of new pathogens to the United States became real during the migration of the West Nile Virus in the summer of 2002, and was accentuated by the unexpected emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since the first cases in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002, and Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Canada in February 2003, SARS has been reported in nearly 30 different countries (1). As of October 2003, SARS has afflicted more than 8000 individuals and caused 774 deaths worldwide (2). In the United States, there have been as many as 164 cases, but no reported fatalities thus far (3). SARS is the first new disease to necessitate involuntary quarantine measures in the United States since 1983 4, 5.",

The members of Coronaviridae are large, enveloped RNA viruses that cause diseases in humans and domestic animals. Disease caused by a coronavirus was first described in 1931; human coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s (11). Little attention previously had been paid to these pathogens due to their relatively innocuous nature. Previously described species include HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which cause respiratory infections. Although coronaviruses primarily infect respiratory mucosa, they also have been demonstrated in gastrointestinal mucosa (12). This may explain the gastrointestinal symptoms noted in nearly 20% of SARS cases (13).",

SARS has now forced a change in thinking. Due to its relatively high infectivity, SARS may present a significant risk to the pre-hospital provider (29). Assisted ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and close provider-patient proximity in the back of ambulances account for this increased risk (30). Even before the arrival of SARS, some first responders were reluctant to provide mouth-to-mouth assisted ventilations, even with a barrier device (31). The potential presence of an infection like SARS can be expected to make first responder intervention less likely. Current CDC guidelines recommend full personal protective equipment (PPE), outlined below, for the transport of any known SARS patient. Unfortunately, this diagnosis may not be known during the initial evaluation (32). Further research is needed toward developing respiratory devices to protect the pre-hospital provider while allowing for adequate airway management.",

In a SARS patient, this delay potentially allows the patient to contaminate the waiting room and infect others. As suggested by Schull and Redelmeier, the presence of a single unrecognized SARS patient in a crowded ED may have created the epicenter of an outbreak (33). During a period of SARS outbreak or concern, triage protocols should be modified so that any patient with a respiratory complaint or fever is immediately asked about travel to areas with community transmission of SARS as well as any exposure to a patient with suspected or probable SARS (34). Placing signs at all ED entrances with instructions to go directly to the triage nurse if either of these contact criteria are met may further reduce the risk of waiting room contamination. If either of those conditions is met, the patient should then put on a surgical mask and be moved immediately to a negative pressure isolation room, if available. Registration and assessment may then continue after ED personnel employ CDC-recommended PPE: gown, gloves, N95 respirator, and eye protection (35). Strict hand washing also must be exercised (34). Health care providers with PPE can then proceed in determining if the patient meets criteria for SARS (22). All used PPE should be discarded in biohazard receptacles and all reusable equipment should be properly sanitized (32). Once disposition of a SARS patient is completed, a terminal cleaning of the room should be done with standard hospital disinfectant (36).",

This authority was exercised for a tourist with SARS symptoms who was involuntarily held for 10 days in the State of New York as well as for an airline passenger returning to Minnesota from the Philippines through San Francisco 37, 38. The HHS guidelines were then inactivated in June 2003, due to the cessation of new human cases (39).

At present, the most prudent solution is to place the patient in an appropriate resuscitation room as far from patient flow as possible, use of full PPE for all involved personnel, and post-resuscitation cleaning as outlined above.

With current CDC guidelines, the key discriminator that separates a patient with potential SARS from a multitude of other ED patients with respiratory complaints is the travel or exposure history. If widespread community transmission occurs in the United States, then it will become exceedingly difficult to separate out the SARS cases. Likely this will be combined with a much greater number of patients presenting without SARS but with similar symptoms and heightened concern for what their symptoms represent. One solution may be placing all patients with any historical concern for SARS in any available isolation measure, even if this means possibly mixing those with and without SARS. Other less attractive alternatives include more stringent triage guidelines, which may prolong the movement of suspected patients out of the waiting room, or the use of isolation rooms throughout the hospital for triage to minimize the mingling of patients, which may contaminate other sections of the hospital. Any overwhelming or shutdown of a hospital, as has already occurred in Beijing, will increase the burden on the remaining local EDs as well as adversely affect those patients who will have to seek their medical care elsewhere (40).",
