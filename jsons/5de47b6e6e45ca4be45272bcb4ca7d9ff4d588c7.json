            "text": "The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel on February 21, 2020. On March 9, 2 a two-week self-isolation was imposed on all people coming from abroad and on March 3 12, schools and universities were closed by the government order, partially switching to 4 distant teaching. Then, on March 19, when the number of daily confirmed cases 5 exceeded 100, all non-essential businesses were ordered to close, the employees were 6 required to increase social distancing of their workers and, if possible, allow them to 7 work from home, whereas people's movement outside their homes was restricted 8 significantly. Still, by March 23, the number of confirmed cases climbed up to 1, 000, 9 accompanied by a doubling period of less than 3 days. A continuous decrease in the 10 growth rate has started only around March 29, after the total number of confirmed 11 cases exceeded 4, 000. By April 30, the doubling period went up to several weeks with 12 only 222 death outcomes out of 15, 946 confirmed cases. 13 Sweden, a country slightly more populated than Israel, detected its first COVID-19 14 cases around February 26. The evolution of the epidemic in both countries is compared 15 in Fig 1. Initially, the total number of confirmed cases grew up much faster in Sweden 16 than in Israel, exceeding 1, 000 on March 15. However, despite much softer intervention 17 policy in Sweden than in Israel, both countries kept reporting similar amounts of seemed to have a limited effect on their reported infection rate. On the other hand, 22 Sweden is suffering a much higher mortality rate than Israel, with the current ratio of 23 about 10 : 1 between the amount of death outcomes in the two countries. With the peak unemployment rate of 24%, mostly due to people placed on unpaid 25 leave as a result of the pandemic, the Israeli government decided to partially lift the 26 lockdown, which has been maintained throughout the Passover holiday (April 7-16). 27 The \"exit strategy\" steps under consideration included increasing the allowed 28 percentage of workers at workplaces, opening some shops, partially resuming public 29 transportation, gradually getting children back to school, and selectively releasing The subsequent sections will focus on each one of these crucial questions. Finally, we 47 will discuss the implications of our data analysis on the prospective decisions to be Following [5] , we assume that the COVID-19 outbreak can be represented by SIR 67 dynamics, which assumes that at any given point of time, each individual in the 68 population belongs to one of the following three states: (I)nfected, (S)usceptible to 69 infection, or (R)emoved from the transmission process. However, the original SIR model 70 and its variations, like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) [4] , are 71 continuous time models based on a set of differential equations. In contrast, we 72 represent the COVID-19 dynamics by a discrete time model, which is more appropriate 73 for the time series data of daily case counts. Fixing the total size of the population 74 under a discrete time SIR model implies that the sum of the daily changes in the 75 amount of individuals belonging to each one of the above three compartments should be 76 equal to zero:",

The chart also shows the main intervention measures 173 taken by the Israeli government during the same period. Since we did not have enough 174 data to estimate the infection rate before March 25, we could not evaluate the direct 175 effect of the school closing around March 12 as well as business activity and movement 176 restrictions imposed on March 19. 177 Apparently, the emergency regulations declared on March 25, which forced most 178 Israelis to stay at their homes, have contributed to social distancing by quickly reducing 179 the mean value of R 0 from 1.26 to 1.00 within 5 days only. An additional decrease in 180 R 0 observed in the beginning of April could be caused by more people wearing masks in 181 public. The Passover lockdown is the most likely factor that brought the reproduction 182 number below 0.70 by April 15, which was the last official day of the Holiday. As can be 183 seen on the same chart, after R 0 went below the value of 1.0, the doubling rate (number 184 of days required to double the number of infected people) climbed highly above the 10 185 days threshold, which was defined in the Government decision from May 04, 2020 as one 186 of the criteria for rolling back the \"exit strategy\" steps.

Hopefully, it will be measured in the near future using 201 massive serological tests but its true past values will remain unknown forever. However, 202 we believe, like the authors of [10] , that the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), the fraction of 203 positive to total tests, should be an upper bound on the IR during the first few weeks of 204 infection. Fig 4 shows the 7 -day moving averages for TPR and for the daily amount of 205 tests between March 11 and April 25. Since the mean TPR reached its peak value of 206 May 5, 2020 6/12 .

The high values of R-Square (0.98) in both 217 regression models may indicate that most COVID-19 deaths are related to previously 218 confirmed cases.

The number of respirators used by COVID-19 patients 238 (70 \u2212 \u221280) in the beginning of May 2020 is very close to the above estimator based on 239 the moving average of new infections started about two weeks earlier. The projected 240 extent of population immunity is calculated as a ratio between the cumulative number 241 of projected infections and the size of the Israeli population (8.9 million), under a 242 conservative assumption that the current Case Fatality Ratio of 1.46% is close to the 243 actual Infection Ratio (IR). The total number of death outcomes can be estimated as a 244 product of the currently known Case Fatality Ratio (1.46%) by the cumulative number 245 of infections. 246 Here is a brief discussion of each simulated scenario: 247 \u2022 R0 = 0.60. Based on the recent dynamics, where R 0 stayed between 0.6 and 0.7 248 at the time of a massive lockdown, this value may imply a continuous slowdown of 249 the Israeli economy. However, it is expected to eliminate the local epidemic by the 250 beginning of June at a minimal cost of about 30 additional death outcomes. On 251 the other hand, a vast majority of Israeli population will remain susceptible to the 252 virus, even if the current Infection Rate in Israel is close to its testing-based upper 253 bound of 10%. It is noteworthy that the daily amounts of new cases reported in 254 the beginning of May are very close to the numbers predicted using this value of 255 R 0 . R0 = 0.80. This value was observed in Israel after significant economic restrictions 257 but before the Passover lockdown. If the corresponding amount of social 258 distancing can be maintained by the entire population, the local virus cases should 259 be eliminated by the beginning of August, again without immunity for at least 260 90% of people. At these and lower values of R 0 , the Government criterion of less 261 than 100 new daily cases from an unknown source should be met most of the time. 262 \u2022 R0 = 1.00. This value seems to be achievable with minimal economic restrictions. 263 Rather than eliminating the virus, it will keep the daily infection rate at 200 to 264 300 cases (exceeding the Government criterion of maximum 100 cases), resulting 265 in about 1, 000 additional deaths and at least 1% immunity by the end of 266 November. This scenario will require about 70 respirators on average, similar to 267 the number occupied in the beginning of May 2020.",
