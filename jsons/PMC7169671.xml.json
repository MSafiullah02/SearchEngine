Different herpesviruses, belonging to different herpesvirus genera or species, showed varying inactivation kinetics by pasteurization. The human herpesvirus HSV was rapidly and completely inactivated with RFs of approximately 6 log or more, whereas the porcine herpesvirus PRV (genus Varicellovirus) generally showed partial heat resistance in process intermediates stabilized with sucrose, with virus RFs generally in the order of 4 log. Limited data sets are available for HHV\u20105 (genus Cytomegalovirus), the BoHV\u20101 (genus Varicellovirus), and EHV\u20101 (genus Varicellovirus), pasteurized in a standard stabilizer (sucrose, glycine, and/or potassium acetate, Table 1). A rapid inactivation kinetic was demonstrated for HSV, HHV\u20105, and EHV\u20101 whereas PRV and BoHV\u20101 (belonging to the same genus as PRV) were inactivated at a slower rate (Fig. 2). In contrast to other herpesviruses studied and to all other enveloped viruses studied, the inactivation kinetic of PRV was dependent on the sucrose concentration (Fig. 3). Interestingly, addition of PRV to the stabilized, nonheated product intermediates resulted in a rapid reduction of virus titer by approximately 1.5 log (data not shown). In an in vivo infectivity study using ducklings, DHBV was inactivated below LOD of the duck infectivity assay after 2 hours pasteurization resulting in a virus RF of at least 6.5 log.6 Emerging viruses or respective model viruses were studied in stabilized VWF/FVIII: the flaviviruses WNV, YFV, the influenza viruses H1N1 and H5N1, the bunyavirus LACV, and the coronaviruses SARS\u2010CoV and TGEV. Effective inactivation of these viruses was demonstrated with no residual infectivity detected by 6 hours (Fig. 4).",

All enveloped viruses, except PRV, were inactivated to below the LOD at time points before the 10\u2010hour production minimum, providing a margin of safety and indicating that the true virus inactivation capacity of the step was likely higher than represented by the log RFs that were demonstrated in the virus validation studies. PRV, a model for herpes viruses and other large DNA enveloped viruses, was also effectively inactivated by pasteurization but with slower inactivation kinetics and the presence of residual infectivity. The slower kinetic rates of PRV inactivation was directly related to sucrose concentration, which illustrates the balance between virus inactivation and protection of therapeutic protein activity; high sucrose concentrations were only employed in processes when required to preserve therapeutic protein functionality. Human herpes viruses studied were inactivated faster than PRV, verifying the use of PRV as a worse\u2010case model virus in virus validation studies. It should be noted that PRV and herpesviruses are large and, therefore, effectively removed by small\u2010 (15\u201020 nm) and large\u2010pore (35\u201075 nm) virus filtration, partitioned by fractionation steps, and are susceptible to other inactivation steps (e.g., Dichtelm\u00fcller et al.18, 19).",

HAV was reliably and effectively inactivated by heat treatment in albumin and in stabilized product intermediates, in line with published data.6, 16 However, the HAV strain HM 175, substrain 24a, is reported to have a higher heat sensitivity than other substrains, at least when pasteurized in albumin.20, 21 Studies using the more heat\u2010resistant HAV substrain 18f demonstrate no or little impact on inactivation kinetics for sucrose stabilized product intermediates (data not shown, manuscript in preparation). Only the nonenveloped animal parvoviruses, CPV and MVM, showed broad resistance to heat treatment (1\u20101.5 log), whereas a slightly higher virus RF of up to 3 log was achieved in the presence of immunoglobulins. Interaction between immunoglobulins and the virus may result in destabilization of the virus capsid, similar to that which is described for heat treatment of human parvoviruses.22 In contrast, the human pathogenic parvovirus B19V is effectively inactivated in most product intermediates, consistent with previous data.17, 22 An exception is the ATIII intermediate where high sucrose and CaCl2 concentrations may be the factors that stabilize B19V; this is in line with Boschetti et al.23\n",
