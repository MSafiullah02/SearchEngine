This virus consists of a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 190 nucleotides that encodes the structural proteins NP, P, M, F, HN, and L and the non-structural proteins V and W. Infection with virulent strains of NDV causes a strong immune response, with different organs expressing varying degrees of exudative inflammation, resulting in the release of large quantities of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and IFN-\u03b2 [1, 2]. Thus, exploring the mechanisms underlying the NDV-induced inflammatory response can aid in understanding the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease.",

            "text": "IL-1\u03b2 is an essential component of the inflammatory process. As the central mediator of the inflammatory reaction, IL-1\u03b2 increases the synthesis and release of IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecules, and vascular cell adhesion molecules, which activate lymphocytes and promote the infiltration of leukocytes and eosinophils into the site of inflammation [3]. An appropriate amount of IL-1\u03b2 expression can repair damage and reduce viral proliferation. However, excessive IL-1\u03b2 expression exacerbates the degree of inflammation, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. Although elevated IL-1\u03b2 expression is common with NDV infection, it is not unique to this virus, as several others, including influenza A virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Sendai virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, also increase IL-1\u03b2 expression [4\u20137]. In fact, a study on influenza A virus found that following inhibition of the IL-1\u03b2 receptor, lung pathology caused by the influenza virus was significantly reduced, indicating that IL-1\u03b2 is a principal component associated with pulmonary inflammation during H1N1 influenza viral infection [8]. Other studies have shown that neutralizing IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 with specific neutralizing antibodies effectively reduces respiratory inflammation induced by influenza A virus [9]. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of the IL-1R\u03b1 receptor or IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody in mice effectively reduces the degree of inflammation induced by Propionibacterium acnes [10]; however, IL-1\u03b2 knockdown in animals showed increased pathogenesis and lethality of Sindbis virus infection [11]. Animals that lack the IL-1\u03b2 receptor exhibit increased susceptibility to the West Nile virus [12]. Thus, it remains unclear whether the IL-1\u03b2 pathway is beneficial or harmful for hosts during viral infection. Currently, it is known that NDV induces the expression of IL-1\u03b2, but whether this expression is excessive or causes inflammatory damage remains unknown.",

The NLRP3 inflammasome consists of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like proteins containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1. Activation of this inflammasome requires two signals. The first is a pre-stimulatory signal, which is activated by the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway and promotes the expression of NLRP3. The second is referred to as the activation signal, which alters the structure of NLRP3 after oligomerization, recruits ASC, activates caspase-1, and cleaves IL-1\u03b2 precursors to form mature IL-1\u03b2 [15, 16]. Moreover, this process is essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the regulation of inflammation, and innate immune responses [17]. Numerous factors activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, including ATP, alum, ultraviolet radiation, and muramyl dipeptide, as well as RNA or DNA from viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens [18]. DNA viruses, such as poxvirus, herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus, can activate NLRP3 inflammasomes and promote IL-1\u03b2 expression [19, 20], while myxoma virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing ROS and cathepsin B [21, 22]. Many RNA viruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and swine fever virus, induce IL-1\u03b2 expression via the NLRP3 inflammasome [23\u201325]. The introduction of NLRP3 into ducks using a lentiviral expression system significantly increased the expression of NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 induced by E. coli and enhanced the degree of inflammation throughout the body [26]. The use of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO and IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies effectively reduce the asthma-induced inflammatory response [27], indicating that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and induction of IL-1\u03b2 are important components in inflammation in the body. NLRP3 activation and caspase-1 cleavage are essential for the maturation and expression of IL-1\u03b2. NDV activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and increases the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in mice and human macrophages [4]. However, in poultry, which are the natural hosts of NDV, NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated expression of IL-1\u03b2 is still unclear.",

Arteritis viral RNA binds to DDX19A, which helps activate NLRP3 and promotes IL-1\u03b2 expression [29]. Stimulation of THP1 cells by the hepatitis C virus RNA genome causes IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels to increase significantly, which is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome complex [30]. 3D proteins of enterovirus 71 also activate NLRP3 inflammasomes and promote the expression of IL-1\u03b2 [31]. Non-structural proteins of some viruses can also promote IL-1\u03b2 production. For example, the PB1-F2 and M2 proteins of influenza virus activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and promote the maturation of IL-1\u03b2 [32, 33]. Furthermore, the 2B viroporin of encephalomyocarditis virus, the 2B protein of rhinovirus, and the E proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus also induce the expression of IL-1\u03b2 [34\u201336]. Consequently, induction of IL-1\u03b2 expression by viruses is likely mediated by different viral components. However, the specific elements of NDV that mediate IL-1\u03b2 expression during NDV infection have not yet been determined.",

For this part of the study, we first prepared a neutralizing antibody against chicken IL-1\u03b2 and verified the antibody using Western blot (Additional file 1). The results demonstrated that the prepared antibody was specific for chicken IL-1\u03b2. Then, eight-week-old SPF chickens were administered GM NDV and treated with either anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody, negative serum, or PBS as the negative controls. The body temperature of each chicken and the deaths of the chickens were recorded daily. The results showed that treatment with anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody decreased body temperature compared to that after treatment with negative serum or PBS after GM infection (Figure 3A). The body temperatures of the two chickens in the anti-IL-1\u03b2-treated group gradually increased after infection, peaked on the 5th day, rapidly decreased, and then slowly returned to normal (Figure 3A). Overall, IL-1\u03b2 protein expression in anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody-treated chickens was lower than that in the negative serum-treated chickens or the negative control group (Figure 3C). More importantly, the mortality of the anti-IL-1\u03b2-treated chickens decreased from 100% to 71%, and these results were compared to those of chickens treated with negative serum or PBS (Figure 3B). These results clearly indicated that neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 decreased both the pathology and mortality induced by virulent NDV.",

NDV has been reported to induce IL-1\u03b2 expression by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in mammalian cells [4]. However, in poultry, whether NDV induces IL-1\u03b2 expression via NLRP3/caspase-1 is still unclear. This study found that NDV induced the expression of NLRP3 in the glandular stomach (Figure 4A). The expression of NLRP3 increased with time in DF1 cells after GM infection (Figure 4B). NDV also induced the activation of caspase-1 in the organs (Figure 4C), and the activation of caspase-1 increased with time in DF1 cells (Figure 4D). After overexpression of NLRP3 and infection with GM, IL-1\u03b2 expression increased from 107.5 pg/mL to 169.3 pg/mL (Figure 4E), and after inhibition of NLRP3 with Si-RNA, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 decreased from 152.8 pg/mL to 87.0 pg/mL (Figure 4F). When the activity of caspase-1 was inhibited by Ac-YVAD-CHO (Figure 4H), IL-1\u03b2 expression decreased from 127.5 pg/mL to 58.9 pg/mL (Figure 4I). Cell viability was unaffected by Si-RNA or Ac-YVAD-CHO treatment (Figures 4G and J). These results indicated that the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome is associated with the NDV-induced expression of IL-1\u03b2 in poultry.",

            "text": "NDV is one of the most important infectious diseases endangering the development of China\u2019s poultry industry today. Chickens are extremely susceptible to this illness, and infection often results in mortality. Alternatively, other animals generally experience milder symptoms than chickens. For example, chickens may suffer serious, life-threatening clinical symptoms following infection with NDV, while other poultry, such as ducks exposed to the same virus, may experience only mild symptoms [37, 42]. This phenomenon may be due to the level of immune response generated by each species, which is mediated by cytokines [43]. In addition, significant differences were observed in the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by NDV infection with strains that varied in virulence or genotype. For instance, chickens that were infected with genotype VIII NDV were reported to express significantly higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12\u03b1 on the third day of infection than chickens that were infected with the genotype VII strain. Conversely, on the 4th day of illness, the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12\u03b1 induced by genotype VIII were lower than those induced by the type VII strain [44]. The current study evaluated the difference in clinical pathogenic characteristics associated with an NDV virulent genotype VII GM strain, which has caused significant detriments in South China, compared to the attenuated vaccine strain La Sota. Study chickens expressed symptoms, such as lack of energy, appetite ablation, and mouth breathing following GM infection. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2 was released in large quantities; subsequently, the animals died within 6 days with 100% mortality. However, this was not the case with the attenuated strain, as a few chickens expressed mild clinical symptoms on the first day, followed by gradual recovery. Furthermore, only minute amounts of IL-1\u03b2 were detected in the organs of these chickens. These results are consistent with those of other published studies that describe the characteristics of NDV and have confirmed the importance of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, induced by the NDV virulent strain in the deadly immune response to this disease in chickens.",

Studies have shown that following infection with NDV virulent strains, various organs exhibited varying degrees of exudative inflammation and inflammatory factors, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18 and IFN-\u03b2, which were released in large quantities, resulted in high animal mortality rates, and were also observed in Experiment 1 of this study [1, 2, 45]. Alternatively, infection with lentogenic strains resulted in only mild non-life-threatening clinical symptoms, with all chickens eventually recovering. However, replacing specific lentogenic strain genes with those of the virulent strain followed by administration to SPF chickens induced severe illness. Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 expression increased significantly, as did the degree of inflammatory damage to the organs, leading to mortality [46]. These results indicated that virulent NDV induces IL-1\u03b2 expression as well as massive accumulation of inflammatory cells, which exacerbated body organ damage and increased animal mortality. We also showed that NDV induced IL-1\u03b2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, IL-1\u03b2 was highly expressed in the lungs and glandular stomach, which are important target organs of NDV, in chickens infected with the virulent strain compared to those infected with the attenuated virus. Moreover, when infected at a MOI of 1, GM NDV induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 than those induced by the La Sota virus in a time-dependent manner, which is consistent with the results of previous studies [47]. Furthermore, as previously noted, treatment of chickens with anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibodies following infection with GM NDV decreased IL-1\u03b2 level in organs, reduced body temperature and decreased the mortality rate, further confirming an essential role for IL-1\u03b2 in the virulence of NDV infection.",

Among them, the NLRP3 scaffold serves to connect ASC and caspase-1. Caspase-1 can then cleave the IL-1\u03b2 precursor to form mature IL-1\u03b2; therefore, NLRP3/caspase-1 have vital roles in the production of IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that NDV replication is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 induced by the NDV strain Herts/33 decreased following NLRP3 knockdown via small hairpin RNA [4]. Thus, we sought to examine the ability of NDV to activate NLRP3 in chickens and other avian cells. The results showed that NDV activated NLRP3 and caspase-1 in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, following overexpression of NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 expression increased. In contrast, inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 caused a significant decrease in IL-1\u03b2 expression, indicating that the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis was involved in NDV-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression in avian cells, which is consistent with experimental results in mammals [4].",

            "text": "Furthermore, we demonstrated that UV-inactivated NDV failed to induce IL-1\u03b2 expression, suggesting that the replication of NDV is necessary for IL-1\u03b2 activation. Various viral components produced by the virus during replication can induce IL-1\u03b2 expression, including viral nucleic acids, ion channel proteins, and non-structural proteins. For example, genomic RNA and the M2 and PB1-F2 proteins of influenza virus have been shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes and promote the maturation of IL-1\u03b2 [5, 32]. Similarly, the 2B protein of encephalomyocarditis virus decreases calcium ion concentrations in the Golgi apparatus in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, thereby promoting the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 [34]. In another example, the non-structural protein 3D of enterovirus 71 directly activates NLRP3 inflammatory bodies to induce IL-1\u03b2 expression [31]. Hence, to further identify the viral components involved in NDV-induced IL-1\u03b2, we obtained GM NDV from viral-infected cell culture supernatants via ultracentrifugation. Viral RNA was extracted and transfected into cells. As the transfection time increased, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 induced by GM NDV RNA increased gradually, and the IL-1\u03b2 protein concentration was found to be significantly higher than that in the control group, indicating that GM RNA induced IL-1\u03b2 expression. Following overexpression of NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by GM NDV RNA increased. Alternatively, inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 significantly decreased IL-1\u03b2 expression. Hence, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that GM NDV RNA induces IL-1\u03b2 expression, which is dependent on NLRP3/caspase-1 activation. However, many questions remain to be answered. For example, it is unclear which components of NDV viral RNA (V genomic RNA, antigenomic RNA, or messenger RNA [48]) are required for the induction of IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, since NDV is a paramyxovirus, the role, if any, of the non-structural V and W proteins in IL-1\u03b2 activation must be investigated because during the process of paramyxovirus infection, non-structural proteins play a regulatory role in the inflammatory response. For example, Sendai virus V protein inhibits IL-1\u03b2 secretion by preventing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly [49]. Similarly, the HPIV3 C protein interacts with NLRP3 to trigger proteasomal degradation of the NLRP3 protein and antagonize IL-1\u03b2 expression [50]. Alternatively, the loss of Nipah virus C protein expression induces increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 [51].",
