On top of everything, this dideoxy chain termination method was diligently used for more than three decades from its discovery. Since the start of the twenty-first century, high-throughput sequencing technology has made an impact on the genomics research because it enabled genome-wide sequencing and screening far easier, inexpensive, and reproducible with lesser need of manpower (Metzker 2010) . Using NGS, the genome of the bacteria can be sequenced in a single run. Sequencing of the DNA allows us to provide the basic information, i.e., the sequence/order of the nucleotides. After recognizing that this could be a magic tool to understand the gene sequences and location of the gene regulatory molecules, a UK-based team led by Dr. Frederick Sanger initiated work on DNA sequencing in 1972. He finally developed the \"dideoxy chain termination\" method for DNA sequencing and also published his work in 1977 (Sanger et al. 1977a ). The method was based upon the base-specific termination of the growing chain. DNA polymerase adds the nucleotides on the chain, but upon the incorporation of dideoxynucleotide, the chain terminates due to its inability of the phosphodiester bond formation between newly coming nucleotide and dideoxynucleotide. In the same year 1977, a US team led by Maxam and Gilbert also published a chemical-based sequencing method in which the sequencing of DNA was dependent on chemical cleavage protocol (Maxam and Gilbert 1977) . This method was based upon the use of harmful chemicals such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and hydrazine and hence was not that popular among molecular biologists. In contrast, the Sanger's method was accepted widely because of its easy protocol and use of lesser harmful reagents (Obenrader 2003) . However, both Fredrick Sanger and Walter Gilbert were awarded with the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980 for their DNA sequencing method discovery. Using Sanger's method, bacteriophage \u03a6X174 genome of 5386 bp was sequenced, and it was the beginning of the full DNA genome sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977b ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 519, "text": "(Metzker 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1056, "text": "(Sanger et al. 1977a", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1578, "text": "(Maxam and Gilbert 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1874, "text": "(Obenrader 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2179, "text": "(Sanger et al. 1977b", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction and History of Sequencing"}, {"text": "Sanger's method was the method of choice and used for the genome sequencing of a number of organisms.

The widely accepted method of sequencing, i.e., Sanger's method of DNA sequencing, covered the firstgeneration sequencing along with Maxam-Gilbert method. Both methods were capable of sequencing about 1 kilobase length DNA fragment at one shot. In the process of analyzing longer sequences, researchers used the \"shotgun technique\" where overlapping sequences were cloned and sequenced separately followed by assembly into contigs (Anderson 1981 ).

Fragments of varied length (length varied by single nucleotide) of the DNA molecule then run on the traditional slab gels and pattern of bands obtained for the sequence determination. Subsequently, radiolabeling is replaced with fluorescently labeled (automated method of sequencing) ddNTPs, and the laser light at different wavelengths does the sequence determination (Smith et al. 1986 ).

Parallel analysis increases the sequencing speed. NGS offers the capability to produce massive volume of data from a single run at a very low cost in a very short duration without the need of fragment cloning strategy, which is generally used in conventional method. As we can see, there is a vast difference in the cost per genome sequencing in 2001 ($100M) as compared to the cost in 2017 (<$1K) (data from NHGRI genome sequencing program). Complete draft sequence of the human genome with the help of automated Sanger's method was published in 2001, which was the outcome of 13 years of rigorous efforts of international project of $2.7 billion.

The path involves several commercial NGS platforms that are based on different technologies but typically follow a general pattern or steps. General steps involved in the DNA sequencing using NGS are (i) library preparation (random fragmentation of genome, ligation with appropriate adaptors), (ii) amplification of library, and (iii) sequencing using different approaches.

Steps involved in pyrosequencing are fragmentation of the nucleic acid to be sequenced followed by synthesis of template strand with the assistance of polymerase enzyme. On incorporation of new nucleotide by polymerase, the pyrophosphate molecule is released. This pyrophosphate molecule converts the ADP to ATP in the presence of the enzyme ATP sulfurylase. ATP molecule supplies the energy for the oxidation of luciferin, which subsequently emits light and recorded by charge-coupled device (CCD). The identity of nucleotides added (all four dNTPs added in the reaction separately) into the reaction for polymerization is known to help in the determination of template sequence. Pyrosequencing-based platform uses a massively parallel system for sequencing in picolitre volumes in microfluidic format. In brief, the methodology of sequencing is the fragmentation of DNA (~800 bp) using spray method (nebulizer), adaptors ligation to the fragmented DNA, library preparation followed by attachment of library to beads (DNA capture beads, which allows attachment of one fragment per bead). The beads make individual compartments, which are usually referred to as microreactors/microvesicles. Clonal amplification takes place in those compartments by emulsion PCR; subsequently, emulsion gets broken and beads attached clonally amplified DNA becomes enriched in microreacters/microvesicles (Margulies et al. 2005) . All clonally amplified DNA-bound beads are individually loaded on picotitre plate (PTP; imprinted on the fiber-optic slide), which contains approx. 3.4 \u00d7 10 9 wells of ~55 \u03bcm in depth and 75 picolitre calculated size.

Adenylation of 3' ends by the addition of single 'A' nucleotide to facilitate ligation with the oligonucleotide adapters carrying a 'T' overhang at 3'. Since ligated adapters are complementary to the flow cell, anchors thus get hybridized. The DNA template attached to the anchors of the flow cell relies for the cluster generation by \"bridge amplification\" in contrast to emulsion PCR (Adessi et al. 2000) . Further, DNA fragment makes an arc and hybridizes with its distal end to neighboring anchor oligonucleotide to its complementary part. Because of clonal amplification, each template generates thousands of copies (clusters) of same template DNA and subsequently millions of separate (unique) clusters are generated on the single flow cell followed by addition of DNA polymerase, and four different fluorescent-labeled reversible terminators aid in sequencing the millions of clusters in parallel fashion onto the flow cell. Polymerization terminates because of the incorporation of fluorescent-labeled reversible terminators (ddNTPs) and incorporated nucleotide is identified by the fluorescence captured (Guo et al. 2008) . By the enzymatic cleavage, the fluorescence label gets cleaved, which permits the incorporation of next nucleotide (www.illumina.com).

DNA polymerase and template immobilize at the base of the ZMW where DNA synthesis takes place (Levene et al. 2003) . Approximately 75K ZMWs/SMRT cells are present allowing 75K single-molecule reactions in parallel fashion. There is concept of physics, which does not allow the laser light (600 nm) to pass completely through the ZMWs (because of zepto-litre holes) and it decays exponentially after entering into ZMW. Thus, the laser light only illuminates the 30 nm of the hole. Phospholinked nucleotides of all four types subsequently pass over the ZMWs. The nucleotides get excited and fluoresce when reaching the base because laser cannot penetrate up within the hole. Therefore, nucleotides cannot be fluoresced till they are present on the surface of the hole. Hence, polymerization reaction takes place continuously; fluorescent signals can be detected in real time so the sequence can be read (Eid et al. 2009 ).

They are divided into four groups of 512 nanopores in each group and controlled by application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Brief methodology for sequencing involves ligation of adapters to the fragments at each end. Adapters enable capture of the fragment and polymerase binding at the 5' ends of the fragments. Additionally, these adapters concentrate the DNA fragments closer to the nanopore, which enhances the rate of fragment capture thousandfold. Also, these hairpin-like adapters allow adjoined sequencing of two complementary strands by covalently attaching the strands to each other. On translocation of a fragment through nanopore, the polymerase processes along the template strand and the process repeats for complementary strand. The sensor identifies the change in ionic charge when fragments move through the nanopore. The change in the ionic charge or characteristic disruption in current is divided into separate events, which ensure associated duration, mean amplitude and variance. The series of events is finally interpreted using computer software/graphical models (e.g., MinKNOW) to identify the nucleotide sequence. Finally, the information collected from the template and complementary strands is merged to generate the \"2D read.\" Another available method for the library preparation does not involve the hairpin adapters to covalently connect two strands of the fragments.

Outbreaks can be stressful for individuals and public. However, traditional epidemiology generally catches the source of an outbreak, for example, by case control studies (King et al. 2012) . For the past so many decades, laboratory investigation played a significant role in investigation and management of outbreak (Sabat et al. 2013 ). Now, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)-based typing is encouraging the employment of nextgeneration sequencing for investigations of public health. WGS is very useful in the detection of outbreak and its management locally and globally and also in the monitoring of evolution of multidrug resistance pathogens (Albiger et al. 2016) . First application of WGS in public health was to dissect the epidemiological connections in hospital-acquired infections, for example, bacterial (Acinetobacterbaumannii) outbreak in 2010 in a hospital in Birmingham, UK (Lewis et al. 2010) . In a very short time, several studies have shown that WGS has taken charge for interpretation and stopping of the transmission pathways of pathogens in hospital outbreaks. Few examples of characterization of newly emerging pathogens, which helped to stop the transmission/spread between patients at the same center and inter health care centers transmission, are Methicillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem resistant Klebsiellapneumoniae (Harris et al. 2010; Snitkin et al. 2012) and early detection of K. pneumoniae high-risk clone (HiRiC) (Zhou et al. 2016) . A large outbreak of highly virulent Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was also characterized by WGS. Upon characterization, WGS has the ability to reveal about isolates like species, strain, virulence, antibiotic resistance and much more information from the genome other than phylogenetic information to manage the case and outbreak. Investigation of foodborne disease and its outbreak management is the most important area for public health welfare, and WGS promises to identify those bacteria. According to a WHO survey, approximately 1900 million people get infected with foodborne pathogens every year and out of them, a big proportion (7,15,000) are not able to survive (2007 . Great improvement has been found in the outbreak detected and outbreak solved (management) of listeriosis by traditional gold standard method in countries like France and US after implementation of WGS. Information about drug resistance and virulence characters can be taken into account for the clinical practice but more correlation among genotype and phenotype is required.

There are organisms in our microbiota, which cannot be cultured and identified. Some very well-known spots are found for the colonization in the human body like stomach, vagina, colon, skin, esophagus, oral cavity, nose and hair. In 2008, National Institute of Health (NIH), USA has started two high-profile human microbiome projects of international level, namely, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit) on the foundation of NGS as a tool. These projects were initiated to isolate and characterize microbes present in the healthy individuals and diseased and to develop the new methods for computational analysis of sequenced genomes. In the MetaHit program, from the sequencing of gut microbiome of 124 healthy adults having obesity, it was found that there are >1000 bacterial species present in the human gut microbiota.

This enables us to detect polymicrobial infections and colonization at better perspective. Also, identification of new species using sequencing of metagenomes by implementing whole genome sequencing method or 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from a mixed population. A new approach, that is, metatranscriptomic method of sequencing, has made the contribution in functional analysis of the interactions among different microbes of a single microbiome. In case of whole genome sequencing, we get longer read length, which enables us in better assembling of genome from diverse organisms. By using reference sequences or denovo clustering, taxonomy profiling can also be performed. Nowadays, it is very much noticeable that imbalance of gut microbiome (also known as dysbiosis) is intensely connected with the immune disorder development and/or improper metabolic functioning (Kim et al. 2015) . Here, we can say that microbiomics has its use in a very controlled manner at the point of care. For instance, if a person is suffering from meningitis and doctors/clinicians are not able to identify (pathogen eluding the clinicians like criminal eluding the police), then microbiomics plays pivotal role for the identification of the responsible pathogen, be it bacteria or amoeba.

This standard time-taking method of culture-based identification/ detection is still being used. However, this classical approach has many limitations, which include problem in cultivation of certain species of microbes like viruses and some other pathogens, which are hard to grow in culture. Further, culturing of microbes is time consuming and too expensive. Nucleic acid based diagnostic methods, for example, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), have progressively replaced the culturing method. PCR-based method is cost effective, sensitive and specific but the main limitation is that it demands prior hypothetical knowledge. It can only identify the conserved targets of the pathogen and cannot distinguish between genotypes; this again restricts the detection of new emerging pathogens (Lecuit and Eloit 2014) . Other methods for diagnosis were also developed, which include multiplex PCR assays, enzyme-linked immunoassays and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to widen the pathogen detection sensitivity and specificity.

The field of \"diagnosis genomics\" or \"pathogenomics\" has unveiled emerging and reemerging pathogens that translate the genomic technologies into methods for diagnosis. This new method has facilitated high-resolution mapping of the genetic determinants in microorganisms that uphold the pathogenicity. Whole genome sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing of rRNA genes have come up as favored technologies for microbial identification from primary human specimens and to analyze the dynamic genomes with a high moldability that is a must for pathogens to cling to life in arduous environment (Edwards and Rohwer 2005; Weinstock 2012 ). Analysis of genomes using whole genome sequencing delivers high-resolution information to differentiate microbial strains that possess difference of as low as one Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), thereby it can replace other multiple tests. For the detection of pathogenic microorganism from patients having suspected infections from uncultivable microbe and or not possible to diagnose by standard diagnostic method, whole genome sequencing method is an ideal option. In such cases, specimen directly from the patient can be sequenced.
