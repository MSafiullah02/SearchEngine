As a result research into applying a plasma discharge into the atmosphere and creating ozone and radicals of strong chemical reactivity to purify the air environment has gathered momentum. The removal of airborne particles, such as bacteria, allow for an improvement in indoor air quality so that our environment is healthy and pleasant. Within the medical field, illnesses caused by viruses such as influenza and SARS (2), hospital infections caused by airborne bacteria, fungi and allergic bronchial tube asthma (3), Japanese cedar hay fever caused by inhaling cedar pollen (4) are becoming large social concerns.",

The results are shown in Fig. 26.4 and display the changes with the passage of time of the amount of bacillus coli in the air. The effect of removing 90% of bacillus Y axis = Rate of Bacteria removal; X axis = Time coli in the air required one hour when discharging cluster ions at a mean ion density of 3000/cm 3 . Figure 26 .5 shows a photo of a Petri dish of the bacillus coli collected cultivated during 24 hours in LB agar medium. Without generating cluster ions, the growth of bacillus coli colonies was confirmed. When positive and negative ions were applied, the generation of colonies were not observed. This showed that the growth of bacillus coli is prevented resulting from their deactivated by positive and negative cluster ions. Figure 26 .6 shows changes with the passage of time in the density of the bacillus coli due to positive and negative ions. In the case of negative ions only (mean density 6000/cm 3 ), the ratio of remaining bacteria after one hour was 85% (removal rate 15%), and the effect of removing bacteria was extremely small and even after more time passed, no more were removed. In contrast, in the case of positive and negative ions with added positive ions (mean density 3000/cm 3 ), the ratio of re- MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) that is a common hospital acquired infection was sprayed into a box with a volume 1 m 3 . The density of MRSA in the air measured using an air sampler. Positive and negative cluster ions were discharged into the air (mean density 10,000 cm 3 ) and it was found that after 30 minutes, 90% of the original MRSA concentration in the air had been removed and after 60 minutes no MRSA could be found in the air.

In particular the reduction of the reactivity of Cry j1 and its monoclonal antibodies was notable. The ELISA method evaluated whether the reaction between the cedar pollen crude antigens and the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood serum of the cedar pollen allergy sufferers changes due to the cluster ions. The results of evaluating the blood serum from 42 different sufferers showed that in 33 patients, due to the cluster ions, regarding the crude antigens, the reactivity with the blood serum IgE of patients reduced significantly. In 2 patients the reactivity with IgE reduced more than 80%, in 3 patients 70 -80%, in 5 patients 60 -70%, in 8 patients 50 -60%, in 6 patients 40 -50% and in the final 4 patients it reduced by 30 -40%.",

When the antigenecity at inhibition rate 50% was evaluated, in cluster ion processing crude antigens 13.5 ng is required while in the case of crude antigens without processing 2.83 ng were required. The cluster ion processing antigens showed the same inhibition rate in an amount of about 4.8 so it was confirmed that the reactivity between the cedar pollen crude antigens and the patients' blood serum IgE was reduced by about 79% by the cluster ions.",
