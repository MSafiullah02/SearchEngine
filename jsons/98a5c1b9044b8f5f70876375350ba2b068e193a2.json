The disease was reported for the first time in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 and spread to several countries in Africa, Asia, Americas and Europe [2, 3] . The capability of human-to-human transmission has been observed in at least four hospital settings [4] [5] [6] [7] . Significantly, MERS-CoV shares certain similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV that produced a global epidemic with more than 8000 human cases in 2002-2003 [8, 9] . First, a number of patients infected with both viruses developed an acute respiratory disease that in some cases resulted in death [7, 9] . In this sense, MERS-CoV appears to be highly pathogenic with an estimated case-fatality rate of around 50%, although this might be an overestimation as many infected patients may not have sought hospital assistance [2] . Second, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and are closely related to coronaviruses isolated from bats [10] [11] [12] . This strongly suggests that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may have been transmitted from bats to humans through intermediate species (e.g. camels for MERS-CoV and civet cats for SARS-CoV).

An important fact in the generation of a model of the outbreak is that the Hong Kong health authorities quickly implemented contagion control procedures [14] . In general, two interventions were introduced to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV. The first was implementation of quarantine measures to isolate healthy people who had been in contact with infected people and therefore potentially in contact with the virus; isolating those that could be infected and asymptomatic during the incubation period and isolating and treating patients who had developed the disease. The other intervention was the application of protective measures by healthy people who were in contact with infected people to avoid becoming infected, such as respiratory protection for healthcare workers and daily disinfection of the environment of affected rooms [14] . These control interventions were implemented progressively in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from mid-March to late April [15] .

Similarly, the output of the variables infected and recovered is highly impacted by the changes in parameters carried out in the multivariate sensitivity analysis (Fig. 7b, c) . The alterations of variable outputs are clearly exemplified by the variable 'dead' (Fig. 7d) . Certain changes in the parameters of the model can explain an increase in the total number deaths during the epidemic rising from about 300 to about 700. The observed variations in model output when the value of the parameters is changed support the idea that this model might be able to simulate different scenarios and epidemic conditions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 74, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 165, "end": 189, "text": "Fig. 7a-d, respectively)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 349, "end": 358, "text": "(Fig. 7a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 524, "end": 536, "text": "(Fig. 7b, c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 622, "end": 631, "text": "(Fig. 7d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "System dynamics modelling has been successfully applied to study complex public health issues such as the design of optimal policies in healthcare [32] , the impact of public health intervention in different situations [33, 34] , and to study disease epidemiology [35] [36] [37] . In the latter, system dynamics technology has become a powerful tool to understand and predict the impact of infectious diseases. Epidemiological models can help health authorities to make recommendations regarding intervention to fight the spread of directly transmissible pathogens, especially when empirical data is limited. In this sense, mathematical models have been previously used to advise health policies against diseases such as pandemic influenza [38, 39] and SARS [31, 40, 41] . Several models studying SARS transmission and interventions have been published. These are detailed hybrid stochastic and compartmental models that successfully explain the behaviour of the epidemic [14, 31, 42] . Here, trying to follow Ockham's razor principle, we have built a simpler deterministic model, which is also able to reproduce the behaviour of the epidemic based on its natural history and the intervention measures taken in Hong Kong.

The solid black line represents the simulation output and the grey area represents the 95% confidence bounds. study even though the average number of contacts recorded differed. Interestingly, the authors suggests that the results may well be applicable to other countries with similar social structures, and that the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection in susceptible populations, such as SARS was in 2003, is likely to be very similar [30] . During the SARS outbreak, health authorities, hospitals, and the overall population progressively implemented quarantine and protection policies to prevent the transmission of the disease [15] . With this in mind, we made the assumption that the intervention of the health authorities caused a decrease in the frequency of contacts, which in turn led a decrease in the rate of contagion. To mimic this event in our model, the number of daily contacts is regulated by means of a repression Hill function, which has been used to simulate repressor activities in complex biological systems [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1636, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 423, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 579, "end": 586, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The basic reproductive number is a key epidemiological variable that characterizes the potential of a disease to spread.

Nevertheless, the estimated value of R 0 also differs in these works and the credible intervals surrounding these deterministic estimations were wide, reaching superior values of almost 8. This high variability can be explained in part by the superspreading events that occurred in SARS epidemics. Superspreading is an unusual situation, in which a single individual directly infects a large number of other people that has a large influence on the early course of the epidemic [42] .

Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure, extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea and also mild or asymptomatic cases.
