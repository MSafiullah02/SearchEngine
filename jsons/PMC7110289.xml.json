TNF-alpha is involved in lymphopenia and increased levels of the cellular receptor of serotype II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) [10, 11]. It has also been reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP is inhibited by TNF-alpha [12]. This finding suggests that neutrophilia in cats with FIP is due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival. We previously reported that the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2-4, with high neutralizing activity against feline TNF-alpha (fTNF-alpha), is applicable as a treatment for FIP [13, 14]. However, anti-fTNF-alpha mAb has not been marketed and cannot be used clinically in animal hospitals. In human medicine, an anti-human-TNF-alpha mAb is used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease [15]. It is commercially available and can be used by veterinarians in their practice. However, whether this human antibody is effective against FIP, a cat disease, is unknown.",

Total RNA was isolated from supernatant and cells from ascites using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using RNA-direct Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with the specific primers 3\u2019-UTR-F (5\u2019-GGAGGTACAAGCAACCCTATT-3\u2019) and 3\u2019-UTR-R (5\u2019-GATCCAGACGTTAGCTCTTCC-3\u2019) and a probe (FAM-5\u2019-AGATCCGCTATGACGAGCCAACAA-3\u2019-BHQ1).

The nine anti-fTNF-alpha mAbs that we reported previously had an IC50 ranging from 5 to 700 ng/mL against rfTNF-alpha at the same concentration [13]. The IC50 of ADA (36.9 \u00b1 23.4 ng/mL) suggests that it has high neutralizing activity against fTNF-alpha compared with these anti-fTNF-alpha mAbs. Generally, mAbs against human cytokines show no cross-reactive neutralizing activity against animal cytokines. However, Aguirre et al. reported that human and feline TNF-alpha have similar neutralizing epitopes [26]. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of human TNF-alpha is 89.7% identical to that of feline TNF-alpha, and 10 of 12 residues that interact with ADA are present in both [27].

These three cats were judged to have developed FIP for the following reasons: i) all three cats had been infected with FIPV, ii) clinical symptoms related to FIP were observed, iii) plasma levels of alpha-1 AGP and VEGF increased, and iv) data from our past animal experiments were used as references. ADA (10 mg/animal) was administered intravenously to the three cats on day 0 and within 4 days after the start of treatment. In addition, ICZ (50 mg/animal) was orally administered daily starting on day 0 of treatment. In cats 2 and 3, improvements in clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results, increases in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and decreases in the plasma alpha 1-AGP level were observed after the beginning of treatment. Symptomatic improvements were observed between 1 and 2 weeks after the start of treatment. Furthermore, in cats 2 and 3, no ascites or pyogenic granulomas were observed pathologically at the end of the experiment, and no changes suggestive of the recurrence of FIP were observed until the end of the treatment period.
