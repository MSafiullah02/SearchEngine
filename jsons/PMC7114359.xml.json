The evolutionary dynamics of AvCoVs are characterised by the continuous emergence of new variants, resulting in multiple serotypes that do not confer cross-protective immunity to each other (Jackwood et al., 2012). AvCoV diversity is mainly driven by three factors: the elevated mutation rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; the great diversity of birds, which provides many potential target hosts for different AvCoV genotypes; and the facilitation of viral transmission and dissemination across large geographic areas and between different species by bird migration and flock lifestyles (Keesing et al., 2010). These factors have driven the generation of a wide variety of AvCoV variants, resulting in persistent reservoirs that can become relevant for human populations when wild animals acquire synanthropic habits and start to live in close proximity to domesticated poultry (Jourdain et al., 2007, Felippe et al., 2010).",

Data from the MCC trees showed that an AIBV strain from Sweden detected in chickens was the nearest ancestor; based on Node 111, the ancestrality frequency was 0.84% (AD), 0.19% (D), and 0.64% (from another ancestor range) (Fig. 7). From these analyses, our results suggest that wild birds may play a role in the spreading of AvCoVs amongst poultry around the globe.",

The sequences from Clade 2 followed the molecular clock model according to the CoV evolutionary rate (Jackwood et al., 2012). Previous studies have estimated an evolutionary rate of 0.3\u20130.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 for some AIBV strains (Cavanagh et al., 1998). Because the sequences were obtained from wild and synanthropic birds and AIBV is primarily found in chickens, we would expect to obtain a different result (i.e., strains from different environments may exhibit differences in evolutionary rates).",

This analysis demonstrated a constant and stationary equilibrium in demographic chicken populations over time (1956\u20132014, sequences from Clade 2) (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, the BSP reconstruction of the demographic history of AvCoV revealed an exponential increase in effective population size in 2009 (sequences from Clade 1) (Fig. 8B). An MCC tree from the BSP prior was positioned with the BSP graphic to verify data reproducibility. The results suggested that the potential increase of AvCoV strains in wild birds was directly related to the increase in animal interspecies AvCoV transmission (n\n = 1 to n\n = 12 to n\n = 32) (Fig. 8B). Use of the coalescent parameter from the exponential population growth model to observe the direction of viral transmissibility using the MCC tree approach (chicken (n\n = 1) to pigeon (n\n = 12) to wild birds (n\n = 32)) enabled an estimation of a coherent epidemiological trace for interspecies AvCoV transmission (Fig. 8B).",

The emergence of new viral variants requires a better understanding of the molecular eco-epidemiology of these viral agents, which will require additional data regarding viral evolutionary behaviour, given the broad transmission and dissemination ranges of AvCoVs and CoVs in general. Finally, due the shortage of scientific studies applying in-depth bioinformatics and phylogenetic approaches in the AvCoV field and considering that many studies that detected CoVs in wild birds were conducted in recent years, a sudden expansion of AvCoVs has emerged in the public domain.
