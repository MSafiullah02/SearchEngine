The participants in our study were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The questionnaire was distributed across seven randomly chosen Facebook groups of university students in Jordan and academic groups on WhatsApp messenger for a one-day period. These social media groups were created by students as a tool for general and academic communication within the students' community and involved students who are currently enrolled in different study programs and levels at various academic institutions in Jordan. The students who were available and willing to be involved in the study could open a link to get an information letter about the study, eligibility criteria, and informed consent as a prerequest to proceed in participation. The authors decided to carry out this study using an internetbased survey due to the current national strict measures on the face to face communication coupled with the closure of all academic institutions in Jordan as per the national response strategy to mitigate the COVID-19 spread, and in response to that, all educational activities have been shifted to online learning platforms since March 15, 2020 (1). In addition, using the internet and social media for recruitment and sampling procedures in this study has shown to be an effective and timeefficient method to reach inaccessible potential participants from different Jordanian regions by eliminating the geographical boundaries.

Similar to Cao et al. (2020) study, our study found that there was no significant difference in the total psychological distress scores between males and females. In addition, the Chinese study found that social support was negatively associated with anxiety status among students, and we have that as one of our most reported coping mechanisms, i.e., socialization through social networking sites. Nevertheless, in our study, age was statistically and significantly associated with distress severity; thus, a younger student had more psychological distress. The difference in distress proportions between our study (92.9%) and the Chinese study (24.9 %) could be attributed to the use of different scales, i.e. GAD-7 vs. K10 as well as the sample size. In addition, we carried out the survey in a period close to final examinations, which might have had an additional negative impact on students' psychological status.",

The response choices with their correspondence score weights are None of the time (1 point), A little of the time (2 points), Some of the time (3 points), Most of the time (4 points), and All the of time (5 points). With having 10 questions and five weighted responses as previously described, the total minimum and maximum scores for the Kessler distress scale (K10) are 10 and 50, respectively. As per the scale's guide, Q3 and Q6 were not asked in our study and were automatically scored as one point if the preceding questions Q2 and Q5 were answered as None of the time. The severity of psychological distress is categorized as the following based on the total K10 distress score for each participant: 10-19 = no psychological distress, 20-24 = mild psychological distress, 25-29 = moderate psychological distress, and 30-50 = severe psychological distress (16).",
