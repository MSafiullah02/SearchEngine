Investigations into this primary event of host\u2013pathogen interaction have revealed a wide array of adhesins in a variety of pathogenic microbes (Finlay and Falkow, 1997). New approaches to vaccine development focus on targeting adhesins to abrogate the colonization process (Wizemann et al., 1999). However, the specific roles of particular adhesins in several pathogens remain to be elucidated.",

Computational methods such as homology search can aid in identification, but this procedure suffers from limitations when the homologues are not characterized. Sequence analysis based on compositional properties provides relief to this problem. Amino acid composition is a fundamental attribute of a protein and it has significant correlation to its location, function, folding type, shape and in vivo stability (Nakashima and Nishikawa, 1994; Nandi et al., 2003). Recently, compositional properties have been applied to the problems as diverse as the prediction of functional roles (Hobohm and Sander, 1995), protein secondary structures (Rost and Sander, 1993), secretory proteins and apicoplast-targeted proteins in Plasmodium falciparum (Schneider, 1999; Zuegge et al., 2001).",

The experimentally characterized adhesins from a wide range of pathogens top the list in genome scans. Several of the predicted adhesins are supported by complementary evidence from Conserved Domain Database search (RPS-BLASTP), BLASTP and the beta helix predictor BETAWRAP (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2002; Altschul et al., 1990; Bradley et al., 2001).

Several proteins with high Pad values were identified using SPAAN for which either limited or no complementary evidence exist. We have classified these proteins as \u2018adhesin-like\u2019. Interestingly, several mycobacterial proteins, namely, 35 PE_PGRS proteins and 12 PPE proteins were identified with high Pad value. SPAAN could identify these putative mycobacterial adhesins even though our training dataset was devoid of mycobacterial proteins.
