Because many microbes have the capacity to persist in the human host for months, years or even decades, the relevant time frame for study of geographic exposures becomes a lifetime. Furthermore, microbes also move and change and reach humans via multiple channels.",

This chapter reviews the factors that shape the global distribution of infectious diseases and the forces that are expected to shift distributions in the future. Examples illustrate the range of factors that affect the distribution and expression of infectious diseases.2\n",

A century and a half ago, John Snow noted that epidemics of cholera followed major routes of commerce and appeared first at seaports when entering a new region. Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, accompanied trade caravans and moved across oceans with rats on ships. Exploration of the New World by Europeans introduced a range of human pathogens that killed one-third or more of the local populations in some areas of the Americas. The plants and animals introduced as a result of this exploration have also had profound and long-lasting consequences for the ecology and economics of the new environment.3 The speed, reach and volume of today's travel are unprecedented in human history and offer multiple potential routes to move biologic species around the globe. Pathogens of animals and plants are being transported as well, and this can affect global food security.4 Establishment of arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, that are competent to transmit human pathogens in new geographic areas expands the regions that are vulnerable to outbreaks of some vector-borne infections. This chapter focuses only on pathogens that directly affect human health and on their sources (Table 106-1\n). When thinking about geography of human infections, it is useful to consider both the origin of the organism and the conveyor or immediate source for the human (Figure 106-1\n).",

Malaria is a vector-borne infection that cannot become established in a region unless a competent vector is present. The presence of a competent vector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human infection. The mosquito must have a source of malarial parasites (gametocytemic human or, rarely, nonhuman primates), appropriate bioclimatic conditions and access to other humans. The ambient temperature influences the human biting rate of the mosquito, the incubation period for the parasite in the mosquito and the daily survival rate of the mosquito. Prevailing temperature and humidity must allow the mosquito to survive long enough for the malarial parasite to undergo maturation to reach an infective state for humans. Competent vectors exist in many areas with no malaria transmission, because the other conditions are not met. These areas are at risk of the introduction of malaria, as illustrated by several recent examples in the USA and elsewhere.7, 8\n",

By 2002 about 48% lived in at-risk areas, but because of population growth and migration the total global population exposed to malaria had increased by 2 billion since 1900 (see Figure 106-2\n).9 For example, in Africa, the population in malaria endemic zones increased by almost 200 million people between 2000 and 2010.10 This contrasts with the situation in the USA, where malaria was endemic in many areas into the 20th century (Figure 106-3\n), with estimates of more than 600 000 cases in 1914. Even before extensive mosquito control programs were instituted, transmission declined. Demographic factors (population shifts from rural to urban areas), improved housing with screened doors and windows, and the availability of treatment were among the factors that contributed to this decrease.",

Other pilgrims who became colonized with the epidemic strain introduced it into sub-Saharan Africa, where it caused a wave of epidemics in 1988 and 1989. The epidemic clone spread to several countries.28 In 1996 in Africa, major outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis occurred (>185 000 reported cases with a case fatality rate of ~10%) caused by N. meningitidis serogroup A, clone III-1.29 In Canada, a virulent group C, ET-15 strain of N. meningitidis was associated with an increased case fatality rate.30 In these examples, the virulence of the microbe and travel and trade acted synergistically to change the epidemiology and burden of disease. In 2000, serogroup W135 N. meningitidis caused an outbreak of infection in pilgrims to the Hajj and spread to their contacts and others around the world. Studies using serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, multilocus DNA fingerprints and other techniques found identical W135 isolates in multiple countries. Before this outbreak, pilgrims from many countries received a vaccine that protected against serotype A but not W135. The polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine reduces risk of disease in the vaccinated individual but does not prevent oropharyngeal carriage or transmission of N. meningitidis.31\n",

Recent travel and trade patterns have led to more frequent contact with populations from low latitude areas, regions with greater species richness.76 Infectious diseases are dynamic and will continue to change in distribution, and access to real time epidemiologic outbreak surveillance data such as that provided by ProMED (www.promedmail.org) is a vital tool for clinicians. Changes in virulence and shifts in resistance patterns will also require ongoing surveillance and communication to healthcare providers. Multiple factors favor even more rapid change, perhaps in unexpected ways, in the future: rapidity and volume of travel, increasing urbanization (especially in developing regions), the globalization of trade, multiple technologic changes that favor mass processing and broad dispersal, and the backdrop of ongoing microbial adaptation and change, which may be hastened by alterations in the physicochemical environment.",
