SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, some of which have been known to cause common colds. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation from person-to-person and aerosol/droplet transmission, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of COVID-19 patients but in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol.",

However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.",

Meanwhile, wastewater surveillance could provide an unbiased method of evaluating the spread of infection in different areas, even where resources for clinical diagnosis are limited and when reporting systems are unavailable or not feasible, such as in developing countries. Moreover, wastewater monitoring can help to detect variations in the circulating strains through phylogenetic analysis, allowing for comparisons between regions and assessment of evolution of the virus genome over time as demonstrated previously for enteric viruses (Bisseux et al., 2018; La Rosa et al., 2014; Lodder et al., 2013) , and more recently for SARS-CoV-2 (Nemudryi et al., 2020) .",

However, limited knowledge is available on recovery efficiencies of enveloped viruses, including CoVs, with the existing virus concentration methods. Ye et al. (2016) reported greater adsorption of enveloped viruses (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV] and Pseudomonas phage \u03a66) to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to nonenveloped viruses. Haramoto et al. (2009) reported that enveloped koi herpesvirus showed high adsorption efficiency to an electronegative filter. Taken together, these results suggest that virus concentration methods using filters may potentially be used to recover SARS-CoV-2 from water and wastewater and requires further investigation. Even within enteric viruses, recovery efficiencies of viruses can vary greatly depending on virus and water types (Haramoto et al., 2018) . Therefore, little scientific evidence is available to inform judgments of the usefulness of these existing virus concentration methods for enveloped SARS-CoV-2, which has quite different characteristics in structural and physical properties from enteric viruses. For example, Wang et al. (Xin Wei Wang et al., 2005b) reported that recovery of SARS-CoV from wastewater was only 1% using an electropositive membrane filter method, a significant decrease in performance compared to that observed for many types of enteroviruses (Li et al., 1998) .",

Three types of process controls are proposed, depending on the points of their inoculation: (i) whole process controls, to be inoculated into a water sample before virus concentration; (ii) molecular process controls, to be inoculated into a viral concentrate before nucleic acid extraction; and (iii) RT-qPCR controls, to be inoculated before RT-qPCR. At least one of these process controls is recommended to be included to avoid false-negative results and for concentration methods with low virus recovery efficiencies. Based on the results, samples may need to be reanalyzed (Haramoto et al., 2018) .

Understanding the decay of SARS-CoV-2 and its RNA will ultimately improve control measures and wastewater treatment requirements, but little has been documented on the persistence of CoVs in water and wastewater matrices. Wang et al. (2005) investigated the persistence of SARS-CoV, Escherichia coli and f 2 phage in hospital wastewater, domestic sewage, tap water, phosphate buffered saline, feces, urine, water, and wastewater with high various concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/L) of chlorine and chlorine dioxide. They also investigated the effect of contact time on inactivation of SARS-CoV in wastewater with low (10 mg/L chlorine and chlorine dioxide) and high (20 mg/L of chlorine and 40 mg/L of chlorine dioxide) concentrations. Results indicated that coronavirus persisted longer (inoculated titer of 10 5 TCID 50 ; detectable with RT-PCR for 14 days) at 4\u00b0C compared to 20\u00b0C (3 days) in hospital wastewater, domestic sewage, and dechlorinated tap water. At 20\u00b0C, SARS-CoV persisted in three fecal samples for 3 days and two urine samples for 17 days (inoculated titer of 10 5 TCID 50 ). SARS-CoV was more vulnerable to disinfectants compared to E. coli and f 2 phage. Free chlorine was more effective in inactivating SARS-CoV than chlorine dioxide. Free residue chlorine of >0.5 mg/L or chlorine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f faster at 23\u00b0C (7-9 days) than 4\u00b0C (>87 days). The inactivation rates of both CoVs were faster in filtered tap water compared to unfiltered tap water at 23\u00b0C, suggesting increased protection and survival in the presence of organic matter and suspended solids. CoVs were inactivated rapidly in wastewater, with T 99 values of <3 days (Gundy et al., 2009 ). Casanova et al. (2009) determined the persistence of two surrogate CoVs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and MHV in reagent grade water, lake water, and pasteurized settled sewage in North Carolina, USA using quantal assays for cytopathic effect (CPE). In general, both the surrogate viruses persisted for significantly shorter durations at 25\u00b0C compared to 4\u00b0C for all water types. For reagent grade water, TGEV and MHV persisted for shorter durations (T 99 = 22 and 16 days, respectively) at 25\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C (>220 days for both viruses). For lake water, TGEV and MHV T 99 values were 13 and 10 days, respectively, over a 14-day experiment. However, at 4\u00b0C, one log 10 reduction was observed at day 14 for TGEV, while no reduction was observed for MHV up to day 14 at 4\u00b0C. Both viruses persisted shorter in pasteurized settled sewage samples, and T 99 reduction times were nine days for TGEV, and seven days for MHV. At 4\u00b0C, T 99 values of TGEV and MHV were 49 and 70 days, respectively, suggesting surrogate CoVs can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage at a lower temperature (Casanova et al., 2009) .",

It is likely that enveloped CoVs are less stable in the environment and is more susceptible to chlorine, pH, and temperature than most of nonenveloped enteric viruses (WHO, 2020d). Therefore, conventional wastewater treatment processes should inactivate SARS-CoV-2, and multiple barriers used in drinking water treatment plants should suffice to remove SARS-CoV-2 to levels of non-detect and low risks (<10 -4 annual risk). However, limited J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f viruses such as low-pathogenic human CoV (e.g., 229E or OC43), feline CoV, MHV, or Pseudomonas phage \u03a66 can be used. Ye et al.

Going back to early descriptions, it has been known that these viruses cause diarrheal as well as respiratory diseases (Britton, 1980) There is no doubt that swimming in sewage-contaminated waters is associated with respiratory disease; however, the etiological agent is not frequently identified (Wade et al., 2010) . Studies on the Great Lakes suggest this could be due to adenoviruses . Respiratory disease as an occupational risk for sewage workers has also been studied with mixed results. Four key studies were reviewed as shown in Table 5 . In Switzerland, no health impacts were found in garbage collectors and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) workers (Tschopp et al., 2011) . However, in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f three other investigations, gastrointestinal effects were observed, and two of the three studies noted respiratory health impacts (Khuder et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2009; Smit et al., 2005) .",

The studies of viral aerosols emerging from wastewater facilities have often focused on coliphage as an indicator for human pathogenic viruses, but most studies have not simultaneously sampled the wastewater and the aerosols produced, or identified how the viruses are distributed in aerosols with respect to the aerosol size profile (Table 6) . Fannin et al. (1985) were not able to detect animal viruses in the aerosols (Fannin et al., 1985) . Adenoviruses are known to be quite stable in air and high concentrations were found by qPCR, thus viable viruses were not addressed (Masclaux et al., 2014) .

(2020a) reported 100% mortality in 12 newborn mice challenged intranasally with 10 2 TCID 50 (J. Xia et al., 2020) . reported that macaques infected with 10 6 via an ocular (2/3) or intratracheal (1/3) route of exposure had a positive viral load in nose and throat swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation, supporting reports of ocular transmission reported for a healthcare worker infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with a patient without eye protection . Previously infected rhesus macaques challenged intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2 at 10 6 TCID 50 did not display reinfection characteristics when challenged again with the same dose, indicating some immunity conferred from an initial infection (Bao et al., 2020a) . Sufficient data are not available for modelling or pooling dose groups from multiple studies at this time that meets the criteria of (i) more than 3 unique dose groups and (ii) at least three unique responses. A lack of a dose-response model for SARS-CoV-2 is a critical gap for conducting QMRA for this pathogen. Emerging areas for dose-response testing include dosing of organoids to represent aspects of specific pathogenesis processes such as liver damage ; however, these approaches have not been reconciled with existing quantitative dose-response modelling calculations as they do not fully encapsulate the ability to represent host immune processes (Haas, 2015) .

Moreover, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and receiving waters and inactivation mechanisms, such as predation, UV, sunlight, and disinfection should be investigated.",
