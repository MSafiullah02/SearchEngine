Methods Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary interest and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. Results Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and the severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p = 0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p = 0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p = 0.71). There were 22 pregnant women delivered 23 live births either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%) and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions Pregnant women have comparable clinical course and outcomes compared with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2. No evidence supported vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the late stage of pregnancy including vaginal delivery.",

            "text": "Pregnant patients with COVID-19 received less treatment compared to non-pregnant women in our study. The reluctant therapy might be explained by the concern of adverse effects in the fetus that could be generated by certain drugs, like interferon-alpha (Hiratsuka et al., 2000, Liang and Acharya, 2020) . Except for the 4 cases of pregnant women that underwent the medical abortion, all the other pregnant women received medications after delivery. Twenty out of 21 pregnant patients used ribavirin as the antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19. Although all be prudently used after delivery or after the decision to terminate the pregnancy, the long-term reproductive toxicity of ribavirin should also be taken into consideration (Narayana et al., 2005) . In terms of antivirus regimens in non-pregnant women, there seems did not have any standardized treatment with four antivirals regimens. The phenomenon could be explained by the quickly updated recommendation by The National Health Commission of China during the study period. Within two months, there were seven versions of recommendation. Regarding to corticosteroids, apart from one pregnant woman received dexamethasone for fetal lung maturity at 35 gestational week, the other three pregnant women all received methylprednisolone due to complaints of dyspnea and rapid progressions on chest radiography. By contrast, most reproductive-aged non-pregnant women received methylprednisolone without clear clinical indications. Although the Chinese Thoracic Society recommended using corticosteroids prudently during the outbreak of COVID-19 (Zhao J. P. et al., 2020) , the rate of corticosteroids using was still high and lack of indications, as reported in previous studies (Wang Dawei et al., 2020 , Zha et al., 2020 . Moreover, the virus clearance time was not associated with corticosteroids using in our study (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42-1.14; p = 0.15), which is consistent with a recently published study (Zha et al., 2020) . In general, decisions of treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women should be more prudent until sufficient clinical evidence appeared.",

            "text": "There are several limitations in our study. First, the majority of the included patients were presented as mild to moderate, which limited the interpretation of the results. Besides, there were five hospitals in Wuhan during the outbreak designated to accommodate pregnant women with COVID-19, which might generate selection bias because more severe patients might be admitted to other hospitals, other than the study hospital. Although a recent epidemiological study included 118 pregnant women reported similar results as our study, comprehensive research of pregnant women with COVID-19 is still warranted. Second, some of the patients with the clinical diagnosis were confirmed with the specific antibody (IgM). Although the reported sensitivity and specificity were good enough, the potential to introduce selection bias should still be taken into consideration, because the test might exclude true COVID-19 patients due to the low concentration of antibody. Moreover, in the beginning, due to the limited test agents, only those with clinical diagnosis had the chance to receive the serological test, therefore those without obvious abnormalities on chest radiology or clinical symptoms have been excluded, and subsequently generated selection bias. Third, all the delivered pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the late stage of pregnancy, which failed us to assess the probability of vertical transmission during the early trimesters. Additionally, due to the nature of the retrospective study, we failed to test samples of the placenta, amniotic fluid, and vaginal mucosa, that diminished the power of the conclusion of no vertical transmission potential. Last, we used virus clearance time as one of the clinical outcomes, but the RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples was not routinely performed due to the lack of agents in the beginning of the outbreak in the epicenter. The test of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was ordered by attending physicians only if there were clues of improvement of COVID-19 according to patients' symptoms and examination results, the subsequent tests for patients with a previous positive result were scheduled on the next 2-3 days which might cause a prolonged documented virus clearance time than reality. However, the two groups were under the same situation, that means the virus clearance time is still comparable. In spite of these limitations, study compared pregnant women with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women is necessary and valuable, which can substantially add important new information for doctors during the pandemic of COVID-19.",
