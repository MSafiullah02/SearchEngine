To confirm this, we analyzed PBMC were lysed in 4 mol/L guanidinium thiocyanate and simultaneously 15 PBMC and 15 liver samples (5 healthy stored at 080\u040aC until extraction of total RNA, which was controls, 5 untreated patients, and 5 treated patients). No performed according to the method of Chomczynski and differences in the cpm values corresponding to b-actin mRNA Sacchi. 25 were observed between the groups. In PBMC samples, cpm To obtain serum samples, venous blood was collected into values were 14808. 8 mL of the first PCR product was amplified (30 cycles) using inner primers (200 ng each) and the same conditions as in the first PCR. After amplification, 15-mL aliquots of the final PCR reaction were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The sequences for oligonucleotide primers were chosen from five noncoding regions of the HCV genome. 28 The primers for HCV cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were: the outer sense, GTATCTCGAGGCGACACTCCACCATAGAT, and outer antisense, ATACTCGAGGTGCACGGTCTACGAGACCT; and inner sense, CCACCATAGATCTCTCCCCTGT, and inner antisense, CACTCTCGAGCACCCTATCAGGCAGT. 28a For HCV RNA analysis in serum, 50 mL aliquots were extracted. HCV RNA was reverse transcribed with random primers and PCR was performed using the above conditions. HCV RNA was quantified by a competitive PCR technique. Briefly, RNA from 200 mL of serum or 1.5 mg of total RNA from PBMC was reverse transcribed with random primers in Validation experiments of PCR assays using known quantities of total RNA (from 0 to 1 mg) were performed (Fig. 1) .",
