All ages of swine are susceptible to the disease, however, the mortality is very high in young pigs, especially those younger than one-week old (Jung and Saif, 2015). Since its first discovery in the late 1970s (Pensaert and De, 1978), PED has continued to cause severe economic impact in swine industry worldwide. Before 2013, PED was prevalent in Asia and Europe. After the spring of 2013, PED outbreaks reached North America and spread explosively (Stevenson et al., 2013; Mole, 2013), causing to deaths of 7 million pigs across USA. Then Department of Agriculture of United States issued a Federal Order in June 2014 making swine enteric coronavirus diseases a reportable disease (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis).",

Plenty of investigations and researches were carried out to try to answer questions in terms of the epidemic following the initial outbreak of PED. Diep et al. reported that PEDV strains closely related to the initial US strains appeared in Northern Vietnam before the US PEDV outbreaks occurred based on the phylogenetic analysis of S gene/protein (Diep et al., 2017). The US MN PEDV strain shared 99.5% identity with China AH2012 strain, but which was not likely a direct source of infection according to genomic and phylogenetic analyses (Huang et al., 2013). The emergent US PEDV strain potentially descended from AH2012 and ZMDZY strains in G2b lineages through recombination (Tian et al., 2014). Other unidentified recombination events and accumulation of adapted mutations were likely involved in this process.",

PEDV was enriched for 100 folds and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The complete genome sequences of these virus strains were sequenced and assembled as described previously (Gong et al., 2017). Briefly, total RNAs of each sample were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). cDNA was generated applying ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase and second strand synthesis enzyme mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Size selection of adaptor-ligated DNA was then carried out using AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA, USA), and fragments of ~360 bp (with the approximate insert size of 300 bp) were recovered. Sequencing was performed employing a 150 bp paired-end (PE) configuration in Illumina Hiseq 2500. Image analysis and base calling were performed by the HiSeq Control Software + OLB + GAPipeline-1.6 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on the HiSeq instrument. Alignment of complete genome sequences were performed using MAFFT. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with neighbor-joining method using MEGA6 software. Bootscan analysis was used to detect the crossover points for the recombination events.",

MH107321). GDS10 was isolated in Guangdong Province in 16 Jun 2013. The full genome length of GDS10 is 28,041 bp (excluding the poly-A tail). The S protein of GDS10 is 1 aa longer than that of CO13, which is the first reported sequence after PEDV being confirmed in the USA in April 2013 (Marthaler et al., 2013). Asp aa is inserted into S protein at the site of 232. GDS10 strain shares 99.9% sequence identity with CO13. GDS10 strain shares 100% aa identity with CO13 in E, M, N and ORF3 proteins, 99.9% in ORF1ab protein, and 99.5% in S protein. Phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome of GDS10, US PEDV strains, and all available strains obtained prior to the early of 2013 indicated that all PEDV strains could be divided into genogroup G1a, G1b, G2a, and G2b. All US strains clustered into 2 branches of G2a clade. 6 strains were the initial US strains and 3 strains contained insertions and deletion in the spike gene (S INDEL). These may be multiple PEDV strains being introduced into USA at the same or similar time. GDS10 clusters with the initial US strains more closely than AH2012 (Fig. 1\n), providing evidence of a common ancestor.",
