As of April 23, 2020, 26.5 million jobs were lost in the US alone (Lambert, 2020). So far, global stocks have seen a downturn of at least 25%. Goldman Sachs predicts the US Gross Domestic Product to shrink 24% in the second quarter of 2020 and forecasts a major contraction in manufacturing, with reduced domestic demand for non-food goods, reduced foreign demand for US goods exports, supply-chain disruptions and plant closures (Reinicke, 2020). In response, governments around the world released massive stimulus packages. The US so far approved $2 trillion to combat the economic downturn (Emma & Scholtes, 2020) and EU finance ministers recently approved \u20ac500 billion in stimulus measures (Riley, 2020).",

In this regard Lee, Sameen, and Cowling (2015) find that innovative SMEs have more problems accessing finance during crises. They show that while financing worsened in the crisis for innovative and non-innovative SMEs, innovative firms have done relatively worse and are particularly likely to face absolute credit rationing.",

Opportunity based management is associated with the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO), which consists of the dimensions innovativeness, proactiveness and consequently the willingness to take risks (e.g., Covin & Lumpkin, 2011). Soininen, Puumalainen, Sj\u00f6gr\u00e9n, and Syrj\u00e4 (2012) find that SMEs with higher EO have better survival chances during and after a crisis. Whereas innovativeness and proactiveness have a positive effect on performance, risk-taking has a negative effect. However, the authors interpret risk-taking as dependency on financial investors and do not tie it to innovative and proactive moves per se. Several authors find positive performance effects of innovative or proactive postures or a combination of both in times of crisis (Le Nguyen and Kock, 2011, Vargo and Seville, 2011, Hong et al., 2012, Bourletidis and Triantafyllopoulos, 2014, Cioppi et al., 2014, Meutia et al., 2018, Dias et al., 2020).

At the same time, SMEs with a responsive MO, that is those intensely considering what competitors are doing and how to best address immediate customer needs, appear to experience limited gains. In consequence, the effect of MO on performance is not significant. Eggers and Kraus (2011) reveal that a combination of EO and responsive MO can lead to lean and flexible marketing efforts that are particularly valuable in times of crisis. Morris and Jones (2020) combine EO and MO into an Entrepreneurial Marketing Post-Disaster Business Recovery Framework that highlights that opportunity-seeking, resource-organizing, creating customer value and accepting risk are markedly different in a post-disaster context. Interestingly, Beliaeva et al. (2018) as well as Eggers and Kraus (2011) show that executing EO and MO are resource intensive endeavors. Along these lines, Marino, Lohrke, Hill, Weaver, and Tambunan (2008) find that higher levels of uncommitted resources help stimulate innovation in times of crisis.",

Being innovative and creating new offerings that go beyond expressed customers\u2019 needs demands the availability of financial resources. This is either because of the higher costs associated with creating such offerings or because a limited amount of resources increases the risk perception of managers and entrepreneurs. If only a limited amount of resources is available, they might consider it even more risky to invest those into projects with an uncertain outcome. The same is true for finance institutions that seem to prefer less risky, that is less innovative investments, in times of crisis (Lee et al., 2015). The positive effects of financial resource availability on EO and ultimately firm performance has been analyzed in additional manuscripts that did not have a crisis focus (Eggers et al., 2013, Hughes et al., 2015). Consequently, SMEs face the dilemma that EO and MO have the potential to increase performance and help survival in times of crisis, but that crises and disasters limit the amount of resources needed to execute such strategies. For SMEs, there apparently is a strategy/funding chicken-and-egg-problem that calls for additional research. After all, crises can create opportunities for SMEs.",

According to Sarasvathy (2001), entrepreneurial expertise supports effectual thinking and behavior. Effectual reasoning tries to overcome highly uncertain situations by applying five principles. These principles forego any planning attempts that try to predict the future. Instead, they suggest that working in the present with currently available means will create some sort of future for the organization. This is supported by only investing limited amounts of resources in a trial-and-error style to figure out the best course of action, working closely with partners and having a mindset that turns negative outcomes into something positive for the company. Applying the concept of effectuation to managing the outcomes of crises and disasters seems to be a fruitful avenue for future research.",

This is not surprising, given the search criteria used in the literature study. The same applies to another firm type that is often discussed in SME research: the family firm. Family firms are organizations where the majority of the capital is held by several members of a family, which intends to hold this for more than one generation, and which controls the management of the company irrespective of a family member or an external being the CEO of the company (R\u00f6\u00dfl, Fink, & Kraus, 2010). Research has shown that family firms often behave differently than non-family firms. Compared to non-family firms, family firms are typically more long-term oriented and less risk-taking, that is more conservative and less focused on growth (Habbershon et al., 2003, Lubatkin et al., 2007, Xi et al., 2015). Although there is research available how startups and family firms react to crises (e.g., D'Aurizio, Oliviero, & Romano, 2015), additional studies are needed that investigate special challenges of and according reactions to the current COVID-19 crisis.",
