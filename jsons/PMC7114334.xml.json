            "text": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are designed to bind to complementary RNA by Watson\u2013Crick hybridization. ASOs are typically designed to arrest translational processes either by inducing cleavage mechanisms involving endogenous cellular nucleases such as RNAse H (Giles et al., 1993) or by sterically blocking enzymes involved in target gene translation (Fig. 1\n) (Stein et al., 1997). Alternatively, ASOs can be designed to target viral genomic regions or RNA secondary structures involved in transcription or genomic-replication processes (Deas et al., 2005, Stone et al., 2008). ASO-mediated interference with these virological processes inhibits production of infectious virus particles in infected cells, potentially reducing cytopathic effects. As illustrated in Fig. 1, one unproven hypothesis about the mechanism of action of ASOs postulates that production of defective interfering particles following ASO treatment may facilitate the generation of productive immunological responses that clear virus following infection.",

This article focuses on PMO-based antiviral therapeutic agents. Overviews of efforts to develop other antisense-based therapeutics for treatment of both viral and bacterial pathogens have been presented in several recent reviews (Haasnoot and Berkhout, 2009, Spurgers et al., 2008, Stein, 2008, Warfield et al., 2006a).",

In these experiments, a tridecamer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (Fig. 2\n) complementary to Rous sarcoma virus RNA introduced to chick embryo fibroblast cells inhibited production of virus (Zamecnik and Stephenson, 1978). Further investigations revealed that hybridization of this oligodeoxyribonucleotide likely inhibited replication by blocking viral protein translation (Campbell et al., 1990, Stephenson and Zamecnik, 1978, Wickstrom, 1986). While the findings of Zamecnik and Stephensen suggested that administration of complementary antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) might prove to be a useful therapeutic approach to achieve gene-specific knockdown, limitations to this approach were quickly realized.",

            "text": "Unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides are susceptible to degradation by endogenous nucleases, which cleave phosphodiester linkages, present in bodily fluids (Wickstrom, 1986). In one of the first oligonucleotide analog derivatives designed to resist nuclease degradation, linkages of natural oligonucleotides were replaced with phosphorothioate groups (Fig. 2) (Campbell et al., 1990). Findings from wheat-germ and reticulocyte cell-free translation assays showed that these phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PTOs) inhibited translation through RNAse H-dependent cleavage of mRNA (Minshull and Hunt, 1986). Matsukura et al. first exploited the antisense properties of PTOs, to inhibit replication of HIV (Matsukura et al., 1987). The benefits of resistance to nuclease degradation conferred by the PTO chemical modifications are diminished by a number of off-target effects, including cleavage of non-target sequences, interaction with a variety of proteins, activation of B lymphocytes, and activation of complement (Henry et al., 1997, Krieg and Stein, 1995, Krieg et al., 1995, Stein et al., 1997, Summerton, 2007). Despite these limitations, the FDA has approved a PTO antisense drug \u2013 fomiversen, for intravitreal treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS \u2013 which to date is the only antisense agent to receive approval for therapeutic application (Geary et al., 2002, Perry and Balfour, 1999).",

Incorporating O-methyl or O-methoxyethyl groups at the 2\u2032 position of the PTO ribose ring increases the potency and nuclease resistance compared to unmodified PTOs (Fig. 2) (Dean and Bennett, 2003, Turner et al., 2006). These modifications do not support RNAse H-activity, which has led to development of chimeric strategies, in which gaps of contiguous unmodified phosphorothioate nucleotide analogs are incorporated to maintain RNAse H activity while retaining the favorable properties of modified PTOs (Turner et al., 2006, Zheng, 1999). The locked nucleic acid (LNA) ASO design incorporates a O2\u2032-C4\u2032-methylene linkage of the ribose rings, a design which supports RNAse H recruitment (Fig. 2) (Kurreck et al., 2002, Veedu and Wengel, 2009). Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) possess no ribose rings and rely instead on a peptide-based structure for the molecular backbone (Fig. 2). As a result, PNAs do not support RNAse activity but effect translational arrest through steric-block mechanisms. PNAs investigated to date have exhibited poor cellular penetration and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties (Larsen et al., 1999, McMahon et al., 2002).",

PMOs are nonionic, a charge status that contrasts with the negative charges associated with native nucleotides and many other ASO design approaches. PMOs do not support RNAse H activity and effect translational arrest or mRNA processing, depending on the target site, through steric block mechanisms. The 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) and transcript sites at or near the AUG translational start codons are most often targeted to achieve translation arrest. Although it has been suggested that the nonionic characteristics of PMOs hinder cellular uptake, PMOs readily enter primary cells (Arora et al., 2004, Iversen, 2008). The in vivo activity of PMO antisense agents against a variety of viral pathogens has been demonstrated and is discussed in greater detail herein. While a number of neutral-charge PMOs have entered human clinical trials (Iversen, 2008, Iversen et al., 2003), none has yet been licensed for treatment of viral infection or other indications.",

Peptide conjugated PMOs (PPMOs; Fig. 2), which include positively charged amino acid residues such as arginine, have been viewed as particularly promising transporters and have shown efficacy in multiple in vivo models of viral infection (Enterlein et al., 2006, Paessler et al., 2008, Stein, 2008, Swenson et al., 2009). The enhanced efficacy of PPMOs has been hypothesized to result from the enhanced affinity resulting from ionic interactions between the net positive charge of the peptides and the negative charge of the complementary RNA and through enhanced pharmacokinetic properties and cellular uptake (Iversen, 2008). However, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses have shown that while the PMO portion of PPMO conjugates are stable in cells, serum or tissue homogenate, the peptide portion is susceptible to degradation (Amantana et al., 2007, Youngblood et al., 2007). This degradation impacts the effectiveness of PPMOs by preventing the efficient escape of the conjugated molecule from endosomal or lysosomal vesicles (Youngblood et al., 2007).",

Two recent reports (Swenson et al., 2009, Warren et al., 2010), showing that these therapeutics are well tolerated and provide improved efficacy in numerous in vivo viral infection models, have broad implications for therapeutic development against viruses and other highly pathogenic microbes. In 2009, Swenson et al. provided preliminary findings showing that intraperitoneal administration of PMOplus\nTM molecules targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 mRNA protected mice against lethal infection (Swenson et al., 2009). These results were expanded upon in a report by Warren et al. that showed that treatment conferred postexposure protection against EBOV and, separately, Marburg virus (MARV) in nonhuman primates (NHPs) (Warren et al., 2010). To achieve postexposure efficacy against EBOV in NHPs, a combination therapeutic (AVI-6002) containing PMOplus\nTM molecules targeting EBOV VP35 and VP24 mRNA was administered either intravenously or at intraperitoneal and subcutaneous sites (Warren et al., 2010). Reducing production of VP24 and VP35 may facilitate viral clearance by host innate and adaptive immunological mechanisms by limiting the interference of these viral products on type I interferon induction and signaling processes with which they are involved (Hartman et al., 2008, Kash et al., 2006, Reid et al., 2006).",

PMOplus\nTM agents have been amenable to the mid-scale, quality-controlled manufacturing needs required for Phase I clinical trials and nonhuman primate efficacy trials conditions reported herein, and these molecules are highly stable in lyophilized form following purification or in solution. Further, they are highly soluble in aqueous solutions or other isotonic solutions in which they may be administered in clinical settings. Initial investigations in nonhuman primates demonstrate that the agents are well tolerated by intravenous administration (Warren et al., 2010), suggesting that their use in emergency-response personnel are not likely to impact the ability of these individuals to perform their critical duties during public health or medical crises.",

The plasma elimination half-life following IV administration of 32.8\u201335 mg/kg ranges from 0.78 to 2.98 h (Warren et al., 2010). These half-lives are comparable to that reported from a rat pharmacokinetic analysis involving a neutral-charge c-myc PMO but somewhat shorter than that of an arginine-rich peptide conjugated version of the c-myc PMO (Amantana et al., 2007). The plasma elimination half-life for neutral-charge PMOs is sequence-dependent and can range from 1.8 to 15 h (Amantana et al., 2007, Arora et al., 2004, Iversen, 2001). Further studies are required to determine whether the pharmacokinetic behavior of these agents is sequence-specific. For the two PMOplus\nTM components of AVI-6002, the primary route of excretion is renal with 23\u201334 percent recovery of the total IV dose from urine within 24 h of administration. The agents of AVI-6003 exhibited reduced renal clearance relative to AVI-6002, with 3.0\u20138.0 percent of the total dose excreted in urine within 24 h. Administered via the IV route, renal half-life for the components of AVI-6002 was 4.9\u20135.2 h and for AVI-6003 was 3.9\u20134.4 h. Following IP administration, the agents are generally rapidly aborbed with a time to maximal plasma concentration of 0.8\u20131.3 h.

Recent mouse studies (Eide et al., 2010, Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2009) have shown that PPMOs directed against immediate early genes ICP(0) and ICP27 of HSV-1 and HSV-2, when administered topically to the eye or genital tract epithelium, for these viruses, respectively, significantly reduced the viral loads in tissues and reduced the number of deaths from these infections. PPMOs can be successfully administered intranasally for treatment of respiratory diseases such as influenza in experimental models. Lupfer et al. showed that fluorescently labeled PPMOs given by intranasal instillation to mice could be detected in lung tissue by fluorescence visualization (Lupfer et al., 2008). Grossly, they observed the presence of fluorescent PMOs in a concentration gradient, which decreased towards the lower lobes of the lung (Lupfer et al., 2008). Microscopically, PPMOs were at highest concentrations in and around bronchioles (Lupfer et al., 2008). Using this intranasal instillation method for PPMO delivery, mice were protected from challenge with influenza virus A subtype H3N8, demonstrating that PPMOs were present in situ at concentrations that were sufficient for antiviral activity (Lupfer et al., 2008).",

Coronaviruses and arteriviruses are RNA viruses that share similar genomic structures. PMOs and arginine-rich peptide-conjugated PPMOs directed against the 5\u2032 UTR of equine arteritis virus (EAV) and against the 3\u2032 UTR of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), respectively, have exhibited antiviral activity in in vitro translation assays and in cell culture (Han et al., 2009, Patel et al., 2008, van den Born et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2006). Regions of the arterivirus genome which can be inhibited by PMOs have also shown to be target regions for inhibiting CoV. These viruses possess a region within the 5\u2032 UTR of the genome termed the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). Arginine-rich peptide-conjugated PPMOs directed against this sequence have been shown to reduce SARS CoV yield in vitro by 104 fold (Neuman et al., 2005). Prophylactic administration of a PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 UTR genomic region reduced liver viral load and diminished hepatic pathophysiology in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), another betacoronavirus related to SARS CoV (Burrer et al., 2007, Neuman et al., 2004). However, viral challenge with delayed PPMO treatment given as a therapeutic regimen did not protect the animals (Burrer et al., 2007).",

West Nile virus, dengue virus types 1\u20134, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus can be blocked by arginine-rich peptide-conjugated PPMOs directed against areas in the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 conserved region number 1 (Deas et al., 2007, Deas et al., 2005, Holden et al., 2006, Kinney et al., 2005). One study described the requirement for the presence of the arginine-rich peptide conjugated to the PMO for protection of mice from WNV infection, since subsequent experimental trials using unconjugated PMOs did not protect (Deas et al., 2007). Increased survival was observed in dengue-2-infected AG129 mice treated using a prophylactic regimen, but not a post-infection regimen, with arginine-rich PPMOs directed towards viral cyclization sequences in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTR, in comparison to treatment with unconjugated versions of these PMOs (Stein et al., 2008).

When the PPMOs were administered prophylactically to mice at 6 or 9 mg/kg, just prior to infection with LCMV and daily for 3 days thereafter, significant reduction of viral growth in spleen and liver tissues was observed upon sampling at day 4 (Neuman et al., 2011). These PPMOs were only administered using a prophylactic regimen, and were not evaluated as strictly therapeutics.",

Two design strategies were implemented in AVI-6003 to enhance the binding of PMOplus\nTM agents with sequence variations known to occur in MARV variants (Fig. 3\n). First, positive piperazine moieties were selectively positioned at sites where mismatches were predicted, in an effort to stablilize non-complementary bases by strengthening the ionic interactions of the PMOplus\nTM molecules with the targeted viral RNA. Second, inosine bases, which indiscriminately pair with adenine, uracil, or cytosine, were incorporated at two positions in the agent targeting MARV VP24 mRNA and at one position in the agent targeting MARV NP mRNA. Inosine residues were positioned to produce complementarity at locations where bases were known to vary between MARV variants, based on previous sequence analyses. Efficacy results obtained in mouse, guinea-pig, and NHP infection models suggest that the PMOplus\nTM design strategy used in AVI-6003 successfully accommodated the sequences predicted in the mouse-adapted Ravn virus isolate and in the MARV-Musoke isolates used in guinea-pig and NHP models of MARV infection (Warren et al., 2010). A similar strategy may prove useful in designing agents against other viruses, to accommodate limited mispairing that would be predicted among virus variants or closely related species.",

PMOplus\nTM-based therapeutics have also been designed and prepared as part of formal rapid-response exercises in only 11 days (Patrick Iversen, personal communication).

The small number of animals involved in this event limits any conclusions that can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the PMO treatment, but the event illustrates that PMOs can be quickly designed and delivered in response to a medical crisis.

Nucleotide variations that alter the complementarity of the target RNA with the antiviral antisense agents were responsible for conferring resistance in SARS CoV, FMDV, and PV1; however, in WNV, resistance determinants were identified outside of a PPMO target site when virus was serially passaged in the presence of a PPMO targeting the untranslated 3\u2032 conserved sequence I (3\u2032 CSI) (Deas et al., 2007). It has been hypothesized that these mutations compensate for 3\u2032 CSI-mediated disruptions of WNV genome cyclization (Stein, 2008, Stein and Shi, 2008). WNV isolated from brains of infected mice treated with 3\u2032 CSI PPMO showed no mutations compared to original virus challenge stock (Deas et al., 2007).
