The transmission initially occurs through the respiratory droplets formed when a patient sneezes, coughs, or even talks, just as in the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses. Droplets can settle down in different parts of the body, such as the mouth, lungs, and eyes of subjects through inhaled air [3, 9] . This disease can also be transmitted by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it [3, 10] . Moreover, transmission may occur through fomites in the environment around the COVID-19 patients. It has been reported that COVID-19 infection may lead to gastrointestinal infection and exist in stool. Hence, COVID-19 may also transmit via fecaloral or body fluid routes. Consequently, coronavirus transmission can occur by direct route (close contact with COVID-19 patients) and indirect route (surfaces in the immediate environment or equipment used by COVID-19 patients) ( Table 1 and 2) . Usually, as with other types of respiratory pathogens, it is accepted that the most contagious time is when subjects are most symptomatic. However, asymptomatic infections can act as a source of the disease [10] . Cases that were infected from asymptomatic subjects in the prodrome phase of COVID-19 were also documented [10] . At present, based on limited findings, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected pregnant mother to baby [11] .",

The positive rate was relatively high for floor swab specimens (ICU: 70%; general COVID-19 ward: 15.4%), maybe due to air flow and gravity causing most virus droplets to float to the ground. Furthermore, as health workers walk around the ward, the virus can be transferred all over the floor, as shown by the 100% positive rate from the pharmacy floor, where there were no COVID-19 patients. Moreover, 50% of the specimens from the soles of the intensive care unit (ICU) staff shoes were positive. Hence, the soles of shoes might act as potential carriers. It has been proposed that staffs disinfect their shoe soles before walking out of wards containing infected subjects [12] .",

All these alterations further explained that COVID-19 may exert a potential effect on lymphocytes, especially T cells. COVID-19 outbreaks and invades via lung mucosa stimulates inflammation cascades and motivates a cytokine storm, resulting in alteration in immune response such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. Hence, intravenous immunoglobulin was applied in most subjects with reduced WBC and lymphocyte count [8] . Augmented serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have also been documented and are associated with the severity of the disease. Nevertheless, elevated levels of interleukin-10, which is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, indicate a diverse pattern from that of SARS-CoV infection [14] . Some patients showed increased liver enzymes and glucose levels, and few patients exhibited abnormal muscle enzymes. Liver test abnormality of COVID-19 may not be induced by liver cell damage but by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons [8] . In summary, blood routine test, CRP, PCT, coagulation function, arterial blood gas, and tissue function tests (e.g. transaminases, bilirubin, myocardial enzyme, creatinine, urea nitrogen, urine volume, etc.) as tabulated in Table 3 should be monitored in patients [17] .

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) can detect GGOs more easily in the early stage [4] . A study with a large sample size (3,665 confirmed cases of the disease) has reported that 95.5% of cases were detected as pneumonia. Pan et al.

In the respiratory system, local lung RAS activation can influence the pathogenesis of lung damage through numerous mechanisms, including elevation of vascular permeability and changes in alveolar epithelial cells. In this cascade, renin increases angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I (Ang I, a decapeptide hormone) [29] . The ACE hydrolyzes Ang I to angiotensin II. The angiotensin II binds to its receptors and induces vasoactive effects. ACE2 catalyzes Ang I and Ang II to generate angiotensin-(1-9) and Ang- (1-7) , respectively, and antagonizes several effects of Ang II. ACE2, by reducing local Ang II levels, acts as a counter-regulatory enzyme [29, 30] .",

In animals infected by SARS-CoV, both the viral spike protein and replication protein alone can decrease ACE2 but not ACE expression. Furthermore, SARS-CoV also motivates quick ACE2 downregulation from the cell surface. These findings suggest that the SARS-CoV interrupts the physiological balance between ACE/ACE2 and Ang II/Ang-(1-7) [29] . Consequently, high Ang II concentration in the lung tissue aggravates acid-induced acute lung injury and causes severe lung failure. Likewise, the spike protein of COVID-19 interacts with ACE2, and the pathogenic mechanism might probably be shared between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 [29] . symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever). For all suspected cases that are undergoing operation, chest CT and blood tests need to be checked before admission. The surgical team can also order an in-house RT-PCR assay within 24h.

In particular, the type I Ang II receptor has been reported to promote disease by motivating edemas and disturbing lung function [38] . Hence, a type I Ang II receptor blocker (e.g., losartan) has been successively examined for improving COVID-19 pneumonia [29] . Treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 probably acts as a competitive interceptor of coronavirus by inhibiting binding of the viral particle to the ACE2 receptor, which can consequently slow coronavirus entry into the cells and protect against lung injury. Remdesivir (adenosine analogue), which is used Chloroquine is a well-known drug that has currently been documented as a strong broadspectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of malarial and autoimmune disease. This drug interferes with glycosylation of the cellular receptor, elevates endosomal pH needed for virus/cell fusion, and consequently reduces virus infection [41] .

Given the high number of surgeries done worldwide, it is essential for the surgeons and surgical team to be adequately protected from coronavirus transmission. In the COVID-19 patients who need surgery, risks versus benefits of the procedure for the patient should be cautiously evaluated.

Nevertheless, for patients with an unknown history, clinical features and imaging appearances can show suspected COVID-19. After that, the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test should be done in these cases, as a reference standard[13].According to the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the diagnostic criteria are: 1.history of exposure to cases with respiratory symptoms from Wuhan or infected cities within two weeks before the onset of disease, 2. clinical findings (fever, normal or decreased WBC count or reduced lymphocyte count, and/or imaging features of pneumonia), and 3. Real-time PCR showing positive results for COVID-19. The confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia case should be hospitalized and isolated for therapy[2].Based on the WHO recommendations for SARS and MERS, the NHC of China proposed criteria for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [13]. A person with two clinical conditions and one contact history is regarded as a suspected patient. Without any clear contact history, suspected cases should have three clinical features [13]. The discharge criteria were: 1. afebrile for more than 3 days, 2. significant improvement of respiratory symptoms, and 3. improvement in the imaging abnormalities of the chest. The definitive etiology diagnosis of infection is needed, which can be made stronger by PCR assay using blood or lung specimen or by viral gene sequencing. Based on the clinical findings, approved subjects are divided into different classes, including critical, severe, moderate, and mild[13].",
