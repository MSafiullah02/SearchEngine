Due to an increased demand in SARS-CoV-2 screenings, alternative protocols with similar sensitivity were needed (8) (9) (10) (11) . Thus, we compared sensitivity from Health Canada approved SeeGene Allplex TM 2019-nCoV rRT-QPCR Assay (thereafter SeeGene) and Altona, with and without RNA extraction.

Next, we measured the stability of the detection in 5 additional samples by amplifying from fresh (stored at 4\u00b0C), frozen at -80 \u00b0C overnight, thawed and stored at 4\u00b0C for 3 days (T0, T24, T48 and T72) ( Figure 3B ). Ct values remained constant across the experiment and all samples could be detected at all timepoints. Our results suggest that UTM medium can be used for direct rRT-PCR and that storage at 4\u00b0C for a few days before testing does not lead to a significant loss of detection.",

Twenty-seven of them could be amplified post-thawing when RNA or swabs were used with Altona's multiplex assay. Thirty-two could be detected from RNA eluates or directly from swabs with SeeGene's multiplex assay (Figure 5b ). The initial Ct mean (before freezing) of samples that were lost following thawing was significantly higher than the Ct mean of samples that could be amplified (25,7 vs 33,7; p<0.0001; unpaired t-test) using Altona and SeeGene (25,97 vs 35,68; p<0.0001; unpaired t-test). This suggests that storing specimens in water at -80\u00b0C can lead to a significant sensitivity loss for low viral load samples. Direct rRT-PCR was as efficient as RNA extraction followed by rRT-PCR to detect positive samples using both methods. In addition, Ct values of the internal control was significantly higher using direct rRT-PCR compared to rRT-PCR from purified RNA with Altona (p=0.0002, paired t-test), suggesting PCR inhibition when RNA is not purified which was not observed with SeeGene. From this experiment, we conclude that RNA extraction can be successfully skipped when swabs are collected in molecular water. However, storing samples at -80\u00b0C collected in water before screening could impact the sensitivity and a decrease detection of patients with lower viral loads.",
