Symptoms of human NoV infection include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramping, chills, headache, dehydration, and a high-grade fever.\u2022Human NoV is difficult to study, because it cannot be grown in cell culture system and lacks a small animal model.\u2022It has been technically challenging to develop rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection methods for human NoV in foods and environment. Most detection methods focus on genomic RNA-based assays.\u2022There is no effective measure to control human NoV. Commonly used sanitizers are not effective against human NoV. High-pressure processing is promising to inactivate human NoV in foods.\u2022No vaccine or antiviral drug for human NoV has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

In recent years, the importance of viruses as a cause of foodborne disease has been increasingly appreciated. Of the viruses commonly associated with foodborne disease, human NoV is the most important and is estimated to account for 58% of all foodborne illness reported every year.2 Based on data available in 2011, more than 5 million cases of food-related illness caused by human NoV are estimated to occur each year, leading to 15,000 hospitalizations and nearly 150 deaths.3, 4 The estimated annual cost of human NoV foodborne disease, based on hospitalizations and lost wages, reaches nearly 2 billion US dollars.3, 5 Despite the considerable impact of human NoV on public health, there are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines to combat the virus.",

Vomiting is seen more commonly in infants and children, whereas adults usually present with diarrhea. The diarrhea associated with the disease is free of blood, mucus, and leukocytes.6 This characteristic differentiates NoV-associated diarrhea from diarrhea caused by bacterial pathogens such as E coli O157:H7, in which blood appears in the stools. The incubation period for the disease is usually 10 to 51 hours and the duration of the disease is 28 to 60 hours.7, 8 NoV affects people of all ages and usually does not require hospitalization. However, severe disease may be observed in infants, children, the elderly, or immunocompromised individuals, all of whom may require supportive care. In immunocompromised patients, chronic NoV infections have been documented, leading to increased morbidity and mortality compared with the general population.9 NoV outbreaks seem to have no clear seasonality, but more cases are reported in the winter months. After infection, individuals may shed virus in the stool for 20 to 40 days at titers as high as 108 to 109 genome copies per gram of stool.10 Human NoV is highly stable in the environment and is resistant to common disinfectants, such as alcohol-based sanitizers and phenolic compounds, so the propagation of disease after a point source outbreak commonly occurs.",

In 1972, the virus was officially identified using immune electron microscopy (IEM).11 Human NoV is commonly called the stomach flu or winter vomiting disease because of its symptoms and the increase in disease occurrence during the winter months. Human NoV is a member of the genus Norovirus within the family Caliciviridae. The Norovirus genus is subdivided into 5 genogroups: GI to GV, with GI, GII, and GIV causing human disease.12 GIII are bovine NoVs, and GV includes murine NoV. The genogroups are further divided into genotypes, and at least 21 genotypes are assigned to the GII genogroup alone.13 The most prevalent human NoV strains circulating in the human population belong to genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4). In the past 10 years, more than 3 global pandemics have occurred, all of which were caused by strains of GII.4.14 The GII.4-2009 New Orleans strain, was identified in the winter of 2009 to 2010 and was the prevalent strain identified in outbreaks in the United States in 2010, displacing the GII.4-2006 Minerva strain.15 More recently a new emerging strain has been identified, the GII.4-2012 Sydney strain, which accounted for more than half of the human NoV outbreaks reported between September and December, 2012.16\n",

            "text": "It has long been debated whether long-term immunity is acquired after human NoV infection. Data are limited to a few volunteer studies involving just a few human NoV strains. It is believed that the diversity between strains of human NoV plays an integral part in its evasion of the immune system. Even closely related strains of human NoV show major antigenic and receptor binding differences. Host susceptibility also plays an important role in human NoV infections. Early volunteer studies with human NoV strain GI.1 found that some individuals did not show symptoms of disease after exposure to the virus.17 Recent studies have shown that individuals with blood type O are more susceptible to GI.1 strain infections than people with other blood types. Human NoVs use the histoblood group antigens (HBGAs), a family of glycans found on many cell types, as functional receptors.18 HGBAs are found on erythrocytes and on epithelial cells, as well as in some body secretions such as saliva and breast milk. Different strains of human NoV may have different binding affinity to different HBGAs, which include A, B, H, and Lewis antigens.19 The \u03b1-1, 3/4 fucosyl transferase (FUT3) and \u03b1-1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT2) genes determine an individual\u2019s status as either a secretor or nonsecretor. Individuals with the FUT3 allele alone are considered nonsecretor, whereas individuals with both the FUT3 and FUT2 alleles are considered secretor. The FUT3 gene encodes the Lewis enzyme, which adds fucose to either the \u03b1-1,3 or \u03b1-2,4 linkage of the HBGA precursor disaccharide, leading to the synthesis of the trisaccharide required for the Lewis A phenotype. The Lewis A phenotype is also referred to as the nonsecretor phenotype. The FUT2 gene encodes a fucosyltransferase, which adds fucose to \u03b1-1,2 linkages of the precursor, creating the H type 1 antigen. Further glycosylation by the Lewis, A, and B enzymes occurs, leading to the expression of other HBGA and the secretor phenotypes.17 An individual\u2019s blood type and secretor/nonsecretor status have been shown to play a role in susceptibility to infection with particular human NoV strains.20\n",

Inside the capsid is the genetic material, which is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The genome of human NoV is approximately 7.7 kb long and is divided into 3 open reading frames (ORF).21 ORF1 encodes the nonstructural polyprotein, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein VP1, and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein VP2. The polyprotein encoded by ORF1 is further proteolytically cleaved into 6 nonstructural proteins in the order of p48, nucleoside-triphosphatase, p22, VPg, 3CLpro, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).22 The functions of many of these proteins have been deciphered by homologies found in cultivable surrogate viruses such as murine NoV and feline calicivirus.22 During the replication and gene expression, the virus produces subgenomic RNA which only encodes VP1 and VP2. A virally encoded protein, VPg, covalently links to the 5\u2032 end of human NoV genomic and subgenomic RNAs.23 The function of VPg may be involved in the initiation of viral protein translation by recruiting translational machinery.",

Therefore, many aspects of human NoV such as molecular biology, gene expression, replication, pathogenesis, and immunology are poorly understood. The survival of human NoV and the effectiveness of measures to inactivate human NoV cannot be accurately evaluated. Because human NoV cannot be grown in cell culture, most laboratory efforts to study the virus use cultivable surrogates.25, 26 These surrogates include viruses that are closely related to human NoV in terms of genetic makeup, size, receptor binding, pathogenicity, and environmental stability. Examples of these surrogate viruses include murine NoV, feline calicivirus, porcine sapovirus, and Tulane virus. The major disadvantage of the use of murine NoV and feline calicivirus as surrogates is that both viruses do not cause gastroenteritis. Murine NoV causes systemic infection in mice, whereas feline calicivirus causes respiratory tract infection in cats.25, 26 It has been proposed that porcine sapovirus and Tulane virus may be better surrogates, because they cause symptoms of gastroenteritis in animals.27 Particularly, Tulane virus recognizes the type A and B HBGAs, similar to human NoV. Other surrogates used for the study of human NoV include VLPs and P domain particles (P-particles).28, 29 These particles resemble portions of the human NoV protein capsid, which are important for receptor binding of the virus to the host cell and antigenic recognition of the virus by the immune system. The particles are noninfectious, because they are composed only of protein and lack the viral genome component of the native virus. Although the use of surrogates has aided in the understanding of human NoV, there are limitations in comparing data generated from the use of surrogates with human NoV.",

A recent publication31 based on human volunteer studies and mathematical modeling estimated a high risk of infection (49%) caused by exposure to 1 human NoV particle. Human NoV is shed in the stool of infected individuals, and viral shedding peaks 1 to 3 days after infection. Viral shedding typically lasts 20 to 40 days in immunocompetent individuals; however, in immunocompromised individuals, viral shedding has been reported up to 56 days after infection, and in chronic cases, viral shedding can occur for years.9 From 105 to 1011 viral copies per gram of feces can typically be shed by an infected individual.31, 32, 33 Approximately one-third of human NoV\u2013infected individuals are asymptomatic but actively shed the virus, leading to further propagation of disease.13\n",

However, to confirm the cause, we must rely on laboratory diagnostic tools, particularly because many human NoV infections are asymptomatic. Because human NoVs cannot be grown in cell culture, viral RNA, viral proteins, or viral particles are targets for detection. Limitations for NoV detection are low concentration of viruses in a sample and extreme genetic and antigenic diversity seen within the genus Norovirus. There are no cross-reactive antibodies that can detect all circulating strains using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Likewise, nucleic acid detection assays are also hampered by low sequence homology because of genetic diversity. Thus, a single primer pair is insufficient for detecting all NoV strains and yet be free of false-positive reactions. For viral particle detection, EM, IEM, and solid-phase IEM (SPIEM) are expensive, require a highly trained observer to distinguish NoVs from other enteric viruses, and a large number of outbreak specimens cannot be rapidly examined.",

A review of 10 EIA/ELISA studies indicated that the sensitivity for NoV detection ranged from 31% to 90% and specificity ranged from 65% to 100%.74 The evaluation of third-generation EIAs has shown vast improvement in both sensitivity and specificity.59, 60 Consequently, some commercial EIA kits offer an improvement for rapid diagnosis of sporadic infections and also are more applicable for outbreak screenings. To have a 90% probability for detecting an NoV as a cause for an outbreak, a minimum of 6 specimens from the same patient have to be tested when using earlier-generation ELISAs.68\n",

Because of the low specificity of many of the human NoV molecular assays, a correct diagnosis may be missed by these techniques and direct EM would elucidate human NoV as the cause. Also, other nonspecified viral agents may be identified using direct EM and may not be detected by clinical laboratory assays. Because many diagnostic laboratories may not have the capacity for direct EM analysis of viruses causing gastroenteritis, a partnering with the public health system would be required for this type of identification. In addition, pooling outbreak specimens and concentrating specimen pools would speed the detection of any cause.

Although human NoV causes self-limiting illness, it causes significant health, economical, and emotional burdens. Recent epidemiologic studies found that severe clinical outcomes including death are often associated with high-risk populations such as the elderly, children, and immunocompromised individuals. The CDC estimates that 900,000 clinic visits by children in the developed world occur annually as a result of NoV infections, leading to an estimated 64,000 hospitalizations.96 From 1999 to 2007, human NoV caused, on average, 797 deaths per year in the United States; however, this estimate has been reduced in recent years.96 Mortality of NoV-associated infection increases during the epidemic seasons, and the burden of human NoV is greater in the developing world. The CDC estimates that NoV causes the death of 200,000 children younger than 5 years every year in developing countries.97 An effective vaccine would be highly beneficial. The increasing clinical significance of human NoV infections suggests that there is an urgent need for an efficacious vaccine against human NoV, particularly for the populations at high risk, such as food handlers, military personnel, elderly, infants, children, and immunocompromised individuals. An effective vaccine would not only prevent acute gastroenteritis caused by this virus but also block transmission routes and thus improve food safety, public health, and biodefense.",

Recently, it was found that gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with human NoV developed symptoms of gastroenteritis, including mild diarrhea, viral shedding in feces, and pathologic changes in the small intestine.101 Subsequently, it was found that gnotobiotic pigs vaccinated with VLPs and mucosal adjuvants (immunostimulating complexes [ISCOM] or mutant E coli LT toxin [mLT, R192G]) triggered NoV-specific antibody responses, thyroxine 1 (Th1)/Th2 serum cytokines and cytokine-secreting cells, and mucosal immune responses.102 Both vaccine candidates induced increased protection rates against viral shedding and diarrhea compared with unvaccinated controls.102 These data suggest that the VLP-based vaccine is protective in gnotobiotic pigs.",

In 1999, Ball and colleagues103 performed the first clinical study to show that baculovirus-expressed human NoV VLPs were safe and immunogenic in humans when administered orally. El-Kamary and colleagues104 and Tacket and colleagues105 (2003) performed a human volunteer study using Norwalk VLPs as antigens. Thirty-six healthy adult volunteers received 250 \u03bcg (n = 10), 500 \u03bcg (n = 10), or 2000 \u03bcg (n = 10) of orally administered VLPs (without adjuvant) or placebo (n = 6). All vaccinees developed significant increases in IgA anti-VLP antibody-secreting cells. Ninety percent who received 250 \u03bcg developed increases in serum anti-VLP IgG. However, neither the rates of seroconversion nor antibody titers increased at the higher vaccination doses. Later, the effects of VLP (containing chitosan) vaccination dose on immune responses were further compared in human volunteers. Only 20% of individuals developed serum IgG and 40% of individuals developed serum IgA when receiving 15 \u03bcg of VLPs. The rate of IgG and IgA was increased to 56% and 72%, respectively, when the vaccination dose increased to 50 \u03bcg. Although these studies showed that VLP-based vaccine candidates are safe and immunogenic, it was not determined whether they can protect humans from human NoV\u2013induced gastroenteritis. Recently, a human study was conducted in healthy adults to assess the protection efficacy of a VLP vaccine candidate (with chitosan and monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL] as adjuvants) to prevent acute viral gastroenteritis after challenge with a homologous viral strain, Norwalk virus (genotype GI.1).96 Within 98 human subjects, 50 participants received the VLP vaccine, 48 participants received placebo, and 90 received both doses (47 participants in the vaccine group and 43 in the placebo group). Norwalk virus-specific IgA antibody was detected in 70% of vaccine recipients. After challenge with Norwalk virus, vaccination significantly reduced the frequency of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis. Sixty-nine percent of placebo recipients developed gastroenteritis, whereas only 37% of vaccine recipients had symptoms. In addition, 82% of placebo recipients had Norwalk virus infection, whereas only 61% of vaccine recipients had infection. It was concluded that the VLP vaccine candidate provided protection against illness and infection after challenge with a homologous virus (see Table 4).96\n",

A combination of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine and a VLP-based subunit vaccine can enhance human NoV\u2013specific immunity.110 Recently, Ma and Li111 generated a recombinant VSV vectored human NoV vaccine candidate (rVSV-VP1). Mice inoculated with a single dose (106 PFU) of rVSV-VP1 through intranasal and oral routes stimulated a significantly stronger humoral and cellular immune response than baculovirus-expressed VLP vaccination. Furthermore, recombinant rVSV-VP1 triggered strong human NoV\u2013specific immunity in gnotobiotic piglets and protected pigs from the challenge of a human NoV GII.4 strain, showing that live vectored human NoV vaccine is protective in an animal model.112\n",
