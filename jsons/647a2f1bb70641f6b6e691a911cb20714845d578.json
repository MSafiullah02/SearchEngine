Here, we incorporate an epidemic model into a game theoretical framework to investigate the effects of travel strategies on infection control. Potential visitors must decide whether to travel to a destination that is at risk of infectious disease outbreaks. We compare the individually optimal (Nash equilibrium) strategy to the group optimal strategy that maximizes the overall population utility. Economic epidemiological models often find that individual and group optimal strategies are very different. By contrast, we find perfect agreement between individual and group optimal strategies across a wide parameter regime. For more limited regimes where disagreement does occur, the disagreement is (i) generally very extreme; (ii) highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits; and (iii) can manifest either in a higher travel volume for individual optimal than group optimal strategies, or vice versa. The simulations show qualitative agreement with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Beijing, China. We conclude that a conflict between individual and group optimal visitor travel strategies during outbreaks may not generally be a problem, although extreme differences could emerge suddenly under certain changes in economic and epidemiological conditions.",

On the one hand, more visitors can lead to substantial benefits for the local economy and businesses. On the other hand, some infectious diseases spread aggressively in major tourism destinations (e.g. Hong Kong, New York, Singapore, Toronto, Beijing), and a large number of visitors can have unexpected impacts on public health [3] [4] [5] . For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced to Beijing, China by a few infected visitors in early March 2003, resulting in a large epidemic [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Other examples where visitors have played a role in regional or international spread include pandemic influenza [12] [13] [14] , Ebola fever [15] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [16] . Enforcing restrictions on incoming visitors could be an efficient way to control local disease outbreaks [7, [17] [18] [19] , but the decision to restrict visitors must be weighed carefully due to the economic and social repercussions.",

Many interventions (such as vaccination and social distancing) create positive externalities, i.e. benefits to those who did not participate in the intervention, because of herd immunity generated by interruption of transmission. Hence, many previous models have illustrated the discrepancy between the optimal individual strategy that maximizes personal interest, and the strategy that serves the group best by minimizing the overall health burden on the population [21 -26] . Although several factors may alter this picture and have been explored in successive worksuch as the beneficial effects of social norms and prosocial vaccination [27, 28] -these models often illustrate a conflict between group and individual optima across a very broad region of parameter space, covering most epidemiologically and economically relevant regimes [21, 22, 24, 25] .",

In the context of travel decisions, game theory can be used to answer questions such as whether travelling or not travelling to a location is optimal according to a criterion of self-interest, and the answers it provides can be contrasted with optimal control strategy from the health authority perspective, in terms of maximizing overall population utility.",

In contrast with many previous game theoretical analyses of decision making in epidemiological systems in a closed population, for this visitor's game, we find perfect agreement between the individual and group optimal strategies for a range of epidemiologically and economically plausible parameter values. This agreement can be observed in two forms: individual and group optimal strategies both completely reject travelling when the real or perceived disease risk level is sufficiently high, or both strategies allow free travel when the real or perceived disease risk level is sufficiently low. However, disagreement (or conflict) between the individual visitor strategy and the group optimal strategy is observed in two forms: an overload or deficit of visitors compared to the group optimum. In regions where disagreement occurs, the disagreement between the individual optimum (corresponding to a 'voluntary entrance' scheme) and the group optimum (corresponding to a 'restricted entrance' scheme) is significant. During an outbreak, this conflict is likely to occur at any real or perceived disease risk level. More importantly, in this region, the model outcomes are highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits. For certain parameter regimes, uncontrolled visitor inflow could result in unexpected large-scale outbreaks when the disease risk level suddenly increases by even a small amount, and the local health authority's travel restrictions could effectively control disease outbreaks when visitor inflow is considered to be 'overloaded' during epidemics. Interestingly, the faster the disease risk information is updated, the more likely a discrepancy will occur. Moreover, faster updating of the disease risk information could effectively prevent visitor inflow 'overload' and therefore stop an outbreak.",

Upon arrival at the destination, they become a 'visitor inside', and subsequently they become a 'removed visitor' and re-join the homeland population, again as a potential visitor. A potential visitor corresponds to N 1 in table 1, a visitor outside corresponds to rN 1 in the term f (r) in equation (3.1), a visitor inside corresponds to (S 1 \u00fe I 1 \u00fe R 1 ) in electronic supplementary material, S3, and an individual in homeland means that a visitor has been removed from the system and re-joins individuals in the homeland. More details of the steps individuals may take in travelling can be found in electronic supplementary material, S1. Figure 1 presents the process of a 'travelling' individual joining the epidemic system (i.e. from 'potential visitor' to 'individual in homeland'). For simplicity, we suppose that every individual receives the same information and picks strategies in the same way (i.e. with equivalent preferences and equivalent pay-off for the same strategy). An individual can decide whether to travel (i.e. the 'travelling' strategy) or not to travel (i.e. the 'non-travelling' strategy) to their destination. We use r 1 to denote the perceived cost (negative pay-off ) of morbidity and/or mortality risk (i.e. the risk of disease, or as a term of 'health cost') from infection. Similarly, we use r 0 to denote the perceived cost of the risk of utility loss for adopting the 'non-travelling' strategy, since those individuals lose economic or social opportunities. Therefore, we write the pay-off for an individual following the travelling strategy as",

A plot of Dr versus the population optimum r* and the individual equilibrium p* during an ongoing epidemic (a \u00bc 1) show that they agree perfectly for most of the parameter space ( figure 3 ). For most of the parameter region, r* \u00bc p* \u00bc 0 or 1 (i.e. the white area in figure 3 ). These two situations can occur when both the disease risk (reflected by R 0 ) and perceived risk are (i) either considerably high, i.e. r* \u00bc p* \u00bc 0, in which case no one intends to travel and complete border entrance restrictions are implemented, or (ii) considerably low, i.e. r* \u00bc p* \u00bc 1, in which case all individuals intend to travel and border entrance is completely unrestricted. Variations in the values of the other parameters do not change the trends of these relationships (table 1) . However, despite the broad agreement across the parameter plane, the region where r* and p* are discrepant reveals interesting findings. During an epidemic, most locations are expected to receive fewer visitors (with limited visitor entrance) than usual when there is no epidemic. But the model predicts parameter regimes where the group optimal solution requires a higher volume of travel than what is individually optimal: in the blue region of the parameter plane, Dr . 0, meaning p* , r* (figure 3a). In this regime, the health authority would wish to encourage more travel than actually occurs. However, if either the disease risk R 0 or the perceived pay-off of disease risk r 1 decline even slightly (for instance, due to seasonal factors and/or changing media coverage) the situation is reversed, and the discrepancy in interests Dr could change from Dr . 0 to Dr , 0 (red region in figure 3a ). When Dr , 0, a health authority restriction on visitors is desired and only r*/p* of the visitors should be allowed to enter in order to achieve the population optimum r*. In summary, figure 3 shows a surprising contrast to many game theoretical models comparing individual and group optimal outcomes: in large parts of the parameter space, there is no discrepancy. However, when a discrepancy does emerge, it can emerge very quickly with small changes in parameter values, and moreover, the individual optimal travel rate could exceed the group optimal rate, or vice versa. fig. 1 of Pang et al. [11] . We note that these two events resulted in almost no one travelling to Beijing, i.e. r \u00bc 0, until the end of the SARS epidemic. 2 We also note that, although the Beijing SARS outbreak was initially sparked by travellers, the proportion of cases in Beijing caused by travellers over the entire outbreak is thought to be small, especially after fever screening began [51] . Also, the United States Centers for Disease Control suggests that travellers to SARS-affected destinations take precautions to avoid infection, suggesting a non-trivial infection risk for travellers. 3 The latter two features of the Beijing SARS outbreak are consistent with our model assumptions. Figure 4b shows a model-simulated epidemic curve that largely matches the observed epidemic curve. To generate this curve we focus on changes in R 0 (disease transmissibility) and r ( proportion of players adopting the 'travel' strategy). We decrease r from 0.5 to 0.25 at the time indicated by the blue dashed vertical line in figure 4b. This decrease is associated with the start of public awareness of the SARS risk in Beijing after it was revealed to the public (see endnote 1). Similarly, the decrease in R 0 from 2.5 to 1.75 as also indicated by the blue dashed vertical line would correspond to an accompanying reduction of the effective contact rate due to the onset of public awareness of SARS. (The effective contact rate is defined as the product of the contact rate and transmission probability per contact. It is believed, and is modelled, to be negatively, or at least non-positively, related to reported disease incidence [42, [46] [47] [48] 52] .) The time lag, i.e. the gap between the pairs of vertical solid and dashed lines of the same colour in figure 4 , is fixed at 3 days due to the mixed effects of the incubation period (or the latent period) of SARS infection and the delay of human reaction figure 4a,b and fig. 8 of [53] . The model-predicted outcome of an earlier implementation of travel restrictions (see blue and red dashed lines in figure 4b) is obtained by fixing the combinations of R 0 and N 1 , and setting r \u00bc 0 (i.e. nobody is able or willing to enter due either to travel restrictions or cautious behaviour due to SARS risk). We found that the earlier the travel restrictions are implemented, the more effectively the disease outbreak level is reduced. By contrast, an uncontrolled and sudden increase in the proportion of visitors (e.g. increasing r from 0.5 to 0.75) could yield a larger outbreak, as indicated by the gold dashed lines in figure 4b.",

Given the perceived disease riskR 0 , the pay-off of the disease risk r 1 (R 0 ), i.e. r 1 as a function ofR 0 given in equation (2.2), is a non-decreasing function ofR 0 and a non-decreasing function of R 0 .

However, different groups of people could have different risk perceptions or risk preferences, hence the pay-offs could differ between individuals. This has been demonstrated in previous game theoretical models to lead to different equilibria and optima regarding the human response to epidemics [26, 64] . Consider the situation where E 1 \u00bc E 0 (see equations (2.2) and (2.3)). In this case, some individuals may prefer the travelling strategy (i.e. risk-seeking preference), while others may prefer the non-travelling strategy (i.e. risk-averse preference).",

One way this could be done is by allowing the disease natural history and economic parameters to vary between individuals (as noted in the foregoing paragraph), to reflect varying health conditions and socio-economic status. Another way to account for heterogeneity at a larger scale is to allow for a patchy environment [1] where different subpopulations are subject to different conditions. Under such circumstances, we expect that the boundaries in figure 2 would probably become less sharp, although it is not clear a priori how large the effect would be. We expect that most forms of heterogeneity would not change our finding that the individual and group optima tend to agree in this kind of game theoretical framework, although the regime shifts implied by figure 2 would probably be less dramatic if heterogeneity were included.",

In this work, we studied an open socio-ecological system in which visitors decide whether to travel to a location with an ongoing outbreak. Surprisingly, we found perfect agreement between the individual and group optimal strategies for broad ranges of parameter values. When a disagreement between the individual and group optimal strategies occurs, the discrepancy was very large and highly sensitive to small changes in disease transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits. For instance, if disease transmissibility increases by even a small amount, the uncontrolled incoming visitors are capable of causing an unexpected outbreak. This suggests that a discrepancy between the individual and group optima could emerge suddenly in realworld settings, provided that slight changes in economic and epidemiological factors (parameters) occur. However, timely rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 15: 20180515 implementation of travel restrictions by health authorities may effectively prevent large-scale outbreaks.",

We observe that both the individual and population optima have the same qualitative relationship with R 0 and r: both optima are monotonically decreasing functions of R 0 and monotonically increasing functions of r. This behaviour is expected, since an increasing transmissibility should reduce both the individual incentive to travel and the group optimal rate of travelling, while a decline in the relative risk of travelling should encourage travel, both individually and as a group. More surprisingly, the sudden transition of the individual optimum from 0 to 1 (as shown in figure 2a) is steeper than that of the population optimum (as shown in figure 2b).",

The black and gold dashed lines are under 'what if' scenarios in which travel restriction (or reduction) failed and travel input suddenly increased, respectively. The values of the other parameters are assumed to be the same as those in table 1, and the changes in parameters are marked at the top of the panel. Note that the timelines are the same in (a,b).
