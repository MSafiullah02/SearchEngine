Interestingly, all these cellular changes were accompanied by an accelerated repair of the lung tissue. At day 7 post\u2010challenge the authors described less necrosis, alveolar exudate, and neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of mice treated with 1MT compared to control mice. Although the number of Tregs (CD4+ Foxp3+) responding to the virus challenge was not altered by 1MT treatment, the inhibition of IDO resulted in fewer Tregs expressing CTLA\u20104 on the cell surface according to the median fluorescence intensity (MFI).88 These data suggest an essential role for IDO during the initial response of the host against the pathogen. This finding could be exploited for the development of vaccines or act as a stimulus for vaccines with weak immune activation to improve T memory responses and reduce disease\u2010associated morbidity.88, 89\n",

From this point of view, hRSV\u2010induced IDO activity could be participating as a mechanism to avoid Th1 immune responses. On the other hand, the up\u2010regulation of IDO results in a decrease in both, central and effector memory CD8+ T cells, which could explain hRSV\u2010reinfections or infections later on in life, as older adults show a lower number of hRSV\u2010specific memory T cells. Increased activity of IDO induced by hRSV seems to be an early event (acute phase) during infection. Likely, the virus takes advantage of the immunosuppressive effects of IDO activity in order to avoid the immune response mediated by T cells, suggesting that, after a Th2 immune response is set against the virus, both IL\u20104 and IL\u201013 regulate IDO activity, and this change could contribute to clear the virus in a later phase of infection. However, this idea needs further empirical confirmation. New therapeutic strategies, as the use of complementary anti\u2010IDO treatment, could improve both, the immunological memory83, 88 and the cytokine profile89 of the host during viral infection. Thus, it would be interesting to assess if 1MT can work as an \u201cadjuvant push\u201d for emerging vaccines, such as vaccines against hRSV and hMPV, which are currently under development.124, 125, 126 An anti\u2010IDO treatment or adjuvant therapy for hRSV infection would require corroborating the up\u2010regulation of IDO and the subsequent inhibition of T cell proliferation and activation in an in vivo model as a first step. Different viruses cause acute respiratory infections; however, there is little information on the relationship between IDO activity and infection by different pathogens within that category. To date, most studies assess hRSV and influenza virus. However, the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against viral diseases requires understanding the pathogenesis of the disease to improve vaccine responses and the design of treatments to prevent and potentially cure chronic viral infections. It may be important to focus on studying the role of IDO during respiratory infections caused by other pathogens.",
