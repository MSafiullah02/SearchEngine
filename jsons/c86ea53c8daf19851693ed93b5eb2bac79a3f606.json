            "text": "Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially including people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I address that potential problem by fitting a generalized additive model to past weekly provisional counts of all registered deaths in England and Wales. The model provides baseline estimates of the number of death registrations expected in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and comparing the baselines to actual counts of recently registered deaths reveals the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. I estimate that, among people aged 45+, 610 \u00b1 405 excess deaths were registered from 21 March through 27 March, 5689 \u00b1 420 excess deaths from 28 March through 3 April, and 9374 \u00b1 470 excess deaths from 4-10 April. Those estimates are larger than the ONS's respective counts of 531, 3432, and 6139 COVID-19-associated deaths, implying that the ONS's counts underestimate rather than overestimate the true death toll. The Department of Health and Social Care's counts of in-hospital COVID-19-associated deaths over the same period are even less, indicating that they are more severe undercounts. If underreporting rates have held steady, about 32,000 COVID-19 deaths might already have been registered but not publicly reported.",

The ONS also breaks down the weekly counts by decedents' region of usual residence (North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, Wales, etc.), and by sex and age group.

Deaths of middle-aged and older adults evince an annual cycle which becomes more pronounced with increasing age. The cycle peaks around January every year, sinks to a minimum every summer, and oscillates in April and May. A model is necessary to adjust for that seasonality (at least for adults) when calculating baselines for death rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. I fit a generalized additive model (GAM) to all of the death counts from week 1 of 2010 through week 9 of 2020, the week ending 28 February 2020. When fitting the GAM I exclude March 2020 to avoid inflating the GAM's baselines by contaminating them with COVID-19-associated deaths. The model assumes that each registered-deaths count has a Poisson distribution, and uses a logarithmic link function because I expect regressors to compound multiplicatively rather than additively. My chosen GAM implementation is the gam function in R's mgcv package, estimating smoothing parameters with the REML method (which sometimes shows less propensity to overfit than the default GCV.Cp method) and enabling penalization to zero by enabling the select option.",

Over the decade of the 2010s, only 10% fewer deaths were registered on Royal Family-related holidays, but 19% fewer were registered for each Christmas holiday during a week -and because most Christmas weeks include two public holidays (Christmas Day and Boxing Day), the model implies that in a typical Christmas week, 34% fewer deaths would be registered. preteens and young teenagers, among whom there are marginally fewer deaths in the summer and early autumn (when most of the children would be on summer holidays away from school). Teenagers and adults aged 15-44 show a less-scrutable annual cycle which oscillates almost from month to month. Then, in all of the older age bands, death registrations have a broadly U-shaped relationship to time of year. Death registrations peak in the winter, trend downwards during spring, and reach a nadir in July and August, before increasing as winter approaches. That overall cycle also includes some subtler features: registrations tend to drop in November, between October's rise and December's rapid winter ramp-up, and the V-shaped mini-cycle in weeks 10-15 is consistently mirrored by an opposing mini-cycle in weeks 15-20.",

From 2010 through 2012, death registrations of those aged 15-64 steadily decreased, but stopped decreasing thereafter. Finally, there is some hetereogeneity among the trends for people aged 65+ (the trend for people aged 75-84 is curiously muted relative to the trends for 65-74-year-olds and those at least 85 years old), but the graphs strongly suggest that they died in increasing numbers from 2010 until 2018.

TRAN is unusual in showing significantly different relationships at different ages: young children appear to be unaffected by TRAN, but a high TRAN is associated with more young adults' deaths and fewer old-age deaths. The inconsistent sign of the relationship between TRAN and death registrations across different ages is arguably anomalous, but since the relationship is consistently small (and virtually nonexistent in pre-adolescents and those aged 65-74) the sign inconsistency is unlikely to be important in practice. After reviewing each of the GAM's individual components, the natural next step is to review the retrospective baselines that the whole GAM produces. Figure 5 plots the GAM's retrospective baselines against all of the original data. The fits for each age band successfully reproduce each band's overall rate of registered deaths, and each band's overall secular trend during the 2010s. The assumption that death registrations are Poisson distributed implies that on the logarithmic-scale plot, the death counts should appear less scattered around higher baselines, and that prediction is borne out; visually, there is a lot of scatter for children (where the baselines are lower), and less scatter for older adults (where the baselines are higher).",

The most obvious explanation is that influenza epidemics each winter, and concomitant peaks in respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, are a major influence on old-age excess mortality in the winter, and the sizes of those epidemics are somewhat random and difficult to predict [19] . deaths, so the GAM cannot account fully for idiosyncratically small or large winter influenza epidemics.

A primary concern informing my modelling is balancing parsimony against the prospect of introducing bias by failing to account for systematic variation in the data. Parsimony leads me to minimize how many interactions among variables I include in the GAM. Crudely, the GAM takes 5 quantities as inputs: age, public-holiday status, week of the year (WK), overall date, and temperature. Thus there are 2 5 \u2212 5 \u2212 1 = 26 broad kinds of interaction the GAM could include in principle, but ultimately I use only 3: age's interaction with WK, with date, and with temperature. I chose those 3 because the results make clear that they are necessary. Figures 2, 3 , and 4 make plain that the relationships death registrations have with WK, date, and temperature differ by age. By contrast, there is strong theoretical reason not to have age interact with holiday status. Death registrations dip on public holidays (and then rebound) because many register offices close on public holidays. Closed register offices register no deaths, regardless of the age of the deceased. As such, public holidays should have the same effect on death registrations regardless of age, and trying to account for different effects according to age is pointless (if not actively harmful, inasmuch as it wastes information in the data on superfluous parameters). To check this theoretical expectation, I expanded the GAM by adding age-holiday interaction terms and refitted it to the death-registrations data; most of the 84 newly added interaction terms were statistically insignificant (p > 0.1), and 6 of the 14 original holiday-status terms became statistically insignificant, with 5 of the 14 implausibly becoming positive (i.e. implying that death registrations increased on average on those holiday weeks). Those results support the dubiousness of putting interactions between age band and holiday status into a model of death registrations. I exclude all three-way and higher-order interactions from the model because such many-way interactions are difficult (albeit not impossible) to justify a priori, are less readily interpretable than two-way interactions and single regressors' relationships, and threaten to exhaust the information in the dataset. As an example of the last risk, for each age band, there are only 10 observations of deaths registered on the last Monday in August, because that holiday occurs only 10 times in the period the ONS data covers. There would therefore be only limited information to fit any three-way interaction between age, holiday status, and any other variable.",

Each age band's WKEDATE smooth can use at most 5 DOF, which permits one inflection point per two years in fitted secular death-registrations trend -enough flexibility to capture multiple shifts in the trend over time, but not so much flexibility as to erroneously absorb individual years' seasonal cycles. Finally, unlike the other smooths, I force each age band's WK smooth to be cyclic, since WK smooths represent annual cycles.

A sensitivity analysis in the next section finds that the GAM's baselines might be wrong by at most about 10% due to the error arising from imputing temperatures. GAM's baselines for older ages are in figure 8 . The observations, plotted as individual circles, run through week 15 of 2020. The ONS reports 108 registered deaths \"where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate\" in weeks 11 and 12 of this year, but registered deaths in those weeks were nonetheless close to the baselines in all of the older age bands. In week 13 (the antepenultimate datum on each of the graphs), death registrations consistently increased on week 12 and were consistently above the baselines; moreover, for ages 75-84, registered deaths in week 13 were above the 95% confidence interval. In week 14, death registrations accelerated greatly, producing a statistically significant excess of deaths in each of the older age bands, and those excesses continued to grow in week 15. Simple visual examination of the plots reveals about 600, 1000, 2000, and 2000 excess registered deaths in age bands 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ respectively in week 14, for a total of approximately 5600 excess deaths. The number of excess deaths in week 15 is patently greater still. Table 3 collects, for each of weeks 12 through 15 and every age band, the precise baselines from the GAM, the actual number of registered deaths, the implied number of excess registered deaths, and the ONS's report of COVID-19-associated deaths. The precise numbers reveal that despite a modest number of their death certificates mentioning COVID-19, the number of excess registered deaths was negligible for children and Comparing the excess-deaths estimates to the ONS's counts of COVID-19-associated deaths suggests that people who die with COVID-19 have been undercounted, and more undercounted in early April than in late March. The ONS reported 102, 531, 3432, and 6139 \"[d]eaths where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate\" among people aged 45+ in weeks 12-15 respectively. Those counts are only 87%, 87%, 60%, and 65% respectively of the GAM-based excess-death estimates, although the 87% estimates for weeks 12 and 13 are very uncertain (due to the relatively large error attached to those weeks' excess-death estimates).

COVID-19 appears to have been blamed for too few deaths, not too many, at least over those 3 weeks. The true number of registered deaths for which COVID-19 is responsible is likely to be at least 53% \u00b1 13% higher than the number of registered deaths where the death certificate mentions the disease.",

In week 15 the Department counted 4812 people who died in English hospitals and 174 who died in Welsh hospitals with COVID-19, for a total of 4986 in-hospital deaths [20] . During that week, therefore, about 1.91 excess deaths were registered for each in-hospital COVID-19associated death. If the same ratio obtains for the subsequent 8466 hospital deaths from 11 April through 20 April [20] , the true number of COVID-19 deaths in England and Wales over the same period may be closer to 16,170 (8466 multiplied by 1.91, with rounding). Adding that to the estimate of 15,673 excess registered deaths in the 3 weeks leading up to 10 April, I conclude that the ultimate number of COVID-19 deaths registered in England and Wales by 22 April could be around 32,000, if deaths have been underreported at a steady rate since March.",

If the response to the pandemic saves some Britons' lives (perhaps by reducing air pollution [21] or motor accidents or attacks of non-COVID-19 infectious diseases) while the pandemic itself kills thousands, my approach would detect only the net effect of both taken together, which would underestimate the gross number of deaths due to COVID-19.",

Such a model could also include more localized weather conditions and other variables which differ substantially among regions, such as humidity, precipitation, and population density.",
