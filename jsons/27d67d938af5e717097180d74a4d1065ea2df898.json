IL-5 preferentially stimulates the proliferation and production of IgA-B cells already committed to this isotype. TGF-\u03b2 stimulates class-switching of IgM-B cells to an IgA phenotype. Bikhazi and Ryan (1995) investigated the expression of those immunoregulatory cytokines associated with the production of different antibody isotypes in experimental acute and chronic OME using in situ mRNA hybridization.

The inductive sites include the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). IgA precursor B cells in the inductive sites are primed and activated by mucosal immunization and disseminate throughout the mucosal effector sites such as nasal mucosa, nasopharyngeal mucosa, and salivary glands via the common mucosal immune system (McGhee and Kiyono, 1994) . NALT has been identified as an inductive site of rodents, and the embryologic as well as immunologic characteristics recently have been investigated (Fukuyama et al., 2002) . In humans, the adenoids and palatine tonsils are considered to act as NALT. Quiding-J\u00e4rbrink et al. (1995) showed that intratonsillar vaccination induced a substantial immune response such as IgG and IgA antibody-producing cells in tonsils. Further, primary immunization in one palatine tonsil followed by a second immunization of both palatine tonsils evoked a larger immune response in the primed tonsil. Sakamoto et al. (1998) demonstrated that the numbers of P6-specific IgA-producing cells in the adenoids were significantly correlated with IgA antibody titers in nasopharyngeal secretions.

Further, the presence of a certain amount of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were observed in both middle ear and nasal mucosa, whereas no \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were found in the other lymphoid tissues such as NALT, cervical lymph nodes, spleen, or Peyer's patches. Those findings suggest that the middle ear mucosa has the same function to nasal mucosa as an effector site of the mucosal immune responses induced by intranasal immunization. Kodama et al. (2000) further investigated the T-cell responses in the middle ear mucosa of mice after intranasal immunization with P6. The data showed an increase of memory T cells as well as P6-specific IgA-B-cell in the middle ear mucosa after intranasal immunization. In vitro stimulation with P6 resulted in a proliferation of purified CD4 + T cells obtained from the middle ear mucosa of immunized mice, and those T cells expressed Th2 cytokine mRNA. Moreover, CD4 + T cells enabled IgA-B cells derived from NALT to differentiate into IgA plasma cells in the middle ear mucosa.

Therefore, effective vaccines for OM must possess surface epitopes of microbial antigens that are common among strains and able to elicit protective antibodies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "APPLICATION OF MUCOSAL VACCINE FOR OTITIS MEDIA"}, {"text": "Because NTHi lack capsular polysaccharide, antigenic determinants of NTHi are outer membrane proteins. Among the outer membrane proteins, P6 is a highly conserved peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein present in all strains of NTHi. Kyd et al. (1995) have demonstrated that intra-Peyer's patch immunization with P6 followed by an intratracheal boost induced P6-specific CD4 + T-helper cell proliferation in lymphocytes isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes and increased antibody response in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. However, the absence of enhanced pulmonary clearance in some animals suggests that the route of immunization might have affected the induction of mucosal immune responses in respiratory tract responsible for the pulmonary clearance of NTHi. To develop a useful vaccine delivery system to prevent OM, Kurono et al. (1999) compared the mucosal immune responses in mice immunized with NTHi antigen intranasally, orally, and intraperitoneally. The results showed that antigen-specific IgA antibody titers in nasal washes and the numbers of antigen-specific IgA-producing cells in nasal passages were significantly increased in intranasally immunized mice when compared with the other groups (Fig. 88.2) . Cytokine assay showed that IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-6 were predominantly produced in intranasal immunization, suggesting that Th2-as well as Th1-type cells were involved in the induction of antigen-specific immune response. Furthermore, bacterial clearance of a homologous strain of NTHi from the nasal tract was significantly enhanced in the nasal immunization group. These findings suggest that intranasal immunization is an effective vaccination regimen for the induction of antigen-specific mucosal immune responses in the upper respiratory tract. Hotomi et al. (1998) investigated the immune responses induced by intranasal immunization with P6.They found that intranasal immunization of mice with P6 together with cholera toxin evoked a good mucosal IgA as well as a systemic IgG response against P6 and increased the number of anti-P6-specific antibody-producing cells in the nasal mucosa of immunized mice. The protective effects of intranasal immunization were confirmed in vitro by the enhancement of nasopharyngeal clearance of NTHi and the inhibition of adherence of NTHi to cultured human epithelial cells. In another experiment, they reported that intranasal immunization with recombinant P6 together with cholera toxin also Oral Cavity, Upper Airway, and Head and Neck Induction of H. influenzae (Hi)-specific antibody-forming cells in mucosal tissues after intranasal, oral, intratracheal, and intraperitoneal (IP) immunization with outer membrane complex of Hi.

They found that the clearance of NTHi from the middle ear was remarkably enhanced and the incidence of NTHi-induced experimental OM was significantly reduced by intranasal immunization with P6 together with cholera toxin (Table 88 .1). Further, immunized mice showed lower concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in MEEs.
