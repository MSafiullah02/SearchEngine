Because the initial epicenter for this outbreak was from China, the majority of data on patients with COVID-19 are from this region. Although a systematic attempt was made to include reports and viewpoints from other heavily affected countries, data related to CV risk factors or presentation were limited. This is important, because the testing strategies, care-seeking behavior, and hospitalization thresholds vary in different settings and can bias numerators and denominators, influencing estimates of the impact of the virus. This selection bias in testing, care, and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates of pre-existing risk factors and patient presentation across the reports from various countries. Furthermore, the majority of the existing analyses, including those related to CV complications of COVID-19 are based on retrospective and often single-center series. Accordingly, data elements were usually reported via chart review, without external prospective ascertainment. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials were present in this publications search. These issues have important implications for research priority setting, and for interpretations of the results reported herein. There is an urgent need for high-quality research in this area, but at this point it is useful to review the available data.",

A number of SARS-related coronaviruses have been discovered in bats, and a working theory is that bats may have been the initial zoonotic host for SARS-CoV-2 given that its genome is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus (8). Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses can use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein that serves many important physiologic functions. It is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, providing the main entry site for the virus into human hosts (8,9). After ligand binding, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis in a manner akin to human immunodeficiency virus (10). ACE2 also serves a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung protective pathway, contributing to viral pathogenicity (11). Figure 1\ndepicts the potential mechanisms for ACE2 with regard to viral pathogenicity and lung protection, as well as the potential effects on this from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition as noted in the section on Drug Therapy and COVID-19.",

As of March 16, 2020, at 11:53 am, there have been a total of 174,961 COVID-19 cases reported globally (3,813 in the United States) associated with 6,705 deaths thus far (69 in the United States), resulting in a crude case-fatality rate of 3.8% (12,13). Johns Hopkins University is making current data available (12,14). The infectivity of COVID-19 is greater than that of influenza, with an estimated R\n0 value (the basic reproduction number, representing viral infectivity) of 2.28 (15). Notably, the death rate associated with COVID-19 is also considerably higher compared with the most recent World Health Organization estimate of seasonal influenza mortality rate of <0.1%, and may reach much higher rates in elderly patients, those with comorbidities, and in those for whom efficient intensive care support is absent (13). While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002 to 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (16), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (16,17). Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (16); 2) there are inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness; and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection). Notably, the appraisal of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be further complicated by asymptomatic infection in a sizable portion of individuals, which may significantly contribute to further spread of infection (18).",

A large study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated that among 72,314 patients with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory confirmed, 16,186 suspected, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed), the clinical severity was reported as mild in 81.4%, severe in 13.9%, and critical in 4.7% (16). The clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 appear to include symptoms common to other viral infections (i.e., fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, fatigue, and diarrhea) as well as laboratory abnormalities such as lymphopenia (19), although knowledge of the clinical feature of the disease is evolving daily (1,20). In severe cases, COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with or without both distributive and cardiogenic shock, to which elderly populations with pre-existing medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable (1,6,20,21). Notably whereas rates of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacterial superinfections in preliminary data appear low (16), patients with the most severe clinical presentations are likely still at risk for coinfections, and unsurprisingly, worse outcomes have been noted in such cases (21,22). Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (23). However, moderate-to-severe illness has been described in children as well (24). Moreover, it is not clear how often children were being tested.",

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 years who receive the influenza vaccine (31,32). Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia affect immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (33, 34, 35, 36). Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post-COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings that are complex, multifactorial, and bidirectional (37,38). In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen that contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment (Figure 1) (5). Additional study is needed to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes.",

There are now case reports of COVID-19 infection among heart transplant patients (39,40). Two heart transplant patients in China, 1 with mild and 1 with severe disease, presented with symptoms typical of COVID-19 disease. Both were managed by withholding baseline immunosuppressive regimens and treating aggressively with high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, and both survived without evidence of allograft rejection. Previous viral outbreaks have noted particularly severe infection in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients (41). Formal treatment guidelines in these patients do not exist at this time. Heart allocation teams need to consider the optimal screening strategies to prevent severe infection in recipients including whether all donor hearts should be screened, given the existence of asymptomatic COVID-19, versus limiting screening to patients with a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19. During the influenza A subtype H1N1 pandemic, to prevent infection in the recipient or as an impetus to initiate prophylaxis if the donor was positive, potential donors were screened if they were symptomatic or had significant exposure history (42). Similarly, screening recipients for a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19 to avoid a post-transplant flare will be reasonable to be considered. Utmost precautions in infection control must be employed when interacting with these vulnerable immunosuppressed patients.",

With severe respiratory infection and hypoxia, especially in the setting of severe infection and ARDS due to COVID-19, it is likely that a number of patients will develop such injury. Elevated serum troponin levels have been described in many patients infected with COVID-19, with significant differences noted between patients who died and those who survived to discharge (22,45). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 341 patients, standardized mean difference of cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19-related illness compared with in those with nonsevere disease (25.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8 to 44.5) (46). Reports have also suggested that acute cardiac injury\u2014which includes not only elevation of cardiac biomarkers to >99th percentile of the upper reference limit, but also electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities\u2014is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis. Cohort studies from hospitalized patients in China estimate that such injury occurs in 7% to 17% of hospitalized patients with the disease (1,6,20) and is significantly more common in patients admitted to the ICU (22.2% vs. 2.0%; p < 0.001) and among those who died (59% vs. 1%; p < 0.0001) (6,8). However, troponin levels can be exacerbated in patients with renal insufficiency due to delayed excretion, which is common in patients with advanced disease. Given limited high-quality data, and the heterogeneity of definitions across the studies, standardized data collection methods are recommended using the most recent Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) (44).",

In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cardiac arrhythmia was noted in 16.7% of 138 patients in a Chinese cohort and was more common in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (44.4% vs. 6.9%) (20). Unfortunately, specifics about the types of arrhythmias that occur in these patients are yet to be published or presented. High prevalence of arrhythmia might be, in part, attributable to metabolic disarray, hypoxia, or neurohormonal or inflammatory stress in the setting of viral infection in patients with or without prior CVD.

Whether heart failure is most commonly due to exacerbation of pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction versus new cardiomyopathy (either due to myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy) remains unclear (55).

            "text": "The predominant clinical presentation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory illness, which may lead to ARDS manifested as ground-glass opacities on chest imaging (56) and hypoxemia. However, similar features may be seen in the case of de novo or coexisting cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As such, it is important to consider cardiogenic or mixed cardiac plus primary pulmonary causes of respiratory manifestations in COVID-19. Historically, right heart catheterization was used to determine pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to aid in this distinction, although this has been removed from the Berlin criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS. Rather, the Berlin criteria use timing of symptom onset, imaging with bilateral pulmonary opacities, and lack of volume overload to identify patients with ARDS (57). In many cases, serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography can help clarify the diagnosis (58,59). However, if these tests are unclear and there remains concern for mixed presentation, pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered in select cases to assess filling pressures, cardiac output, and to guide clinical decision making, given the different management approaches for ARDS and cardiogenic shock. Finally, it is crucial to determine whether a concomitant cardiogenic component is present when considering mechanical respiratory and circulatory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) or other techniques, as this may lead to changes in device selection (e.g., venovenous vs. venoarterial ECMO cannulation). Regardless, in the most severe of infections with ARDS and necrotizing pneumonias, patient prognosis may be poor even with ECMO support. In a case series of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 83.3% (5 of 6) of patients who were treated with ECMO did not survive. Further studies regarding the utility of ECMO support in advanced COVID-19, including which patients may (or may not) benefit and whether concomitant left ventricular venting should be done, are warranted (60).",

(61) suggests that rates of thrombotic complications may be as high as 31% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Reports suggest abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease (62,63). In a multicenter retrospective cohort study from China, elevated D-dimer levels (>1 g/l) were strongly associated with in-hospital death, even after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio: 18.4; 95% CI: 2.6 to 128.6; p = 0.003) (6). In another study comparing COVID-19 survivors to nonsurvivors, nonsurvivors had significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation products levels, and 71.4% of nonsurvivors met clinical criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation during the course of their disease (62). In addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation, critically ill patients with prolonged immobilization are inherently at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Vascular inflammation may also contribute to the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients. In the setting of critically ill COVID-19 patients who demonstrate clinical deterioration as evidenced by hypoxia or hemodynamic instability, thromboembolic disease should be considered. Retrospective data from 97 patients with severe COVID-19, the majority of whom received prophylactic dose low\u2013molecular-weight heparin in the setting of sepsis-induced coagulopathy, suggests that anticoagulation in such patients may be associated with lower mortality rates (64). The optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness is not known, however. As such, contemporary guideline-endorsed strategies should be observed (65). Given the drug-drug interactions between some antiviral treatments and direct oral anticoagulants, low molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical prophylaxis are likely to be preferred in acutely ill hospitalized patients.",

The active metabolite for clopidogrel is mostly formed by CYP2C19, but several other CYP enzymes contribute, including CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A (73,74). Given the increase in serum ticagrelor levels with such medications (75,76), concomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged in the United States and Canada due to excess in bleeding risk. Conversely, there is evidence that clopidogrel may not always provide sufficient platelet inhibition in the setting of concomitant administration of ritonavir, whereas this was not the case with prasugrel as assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accumetrics, San Diego, California) (73,74). If P2Y12 inhibition is needed during treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, prasugrel can be used; however, if contraindicated (i.e., history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, low body mass index, or active pathological bleeding), a testing-guided approach (e.g., with P2Y12 platelet function assays) may be considered with alternate antiplatelet agents. Details about switching between P2Y12 inhibitors have been described elsewhere (77). Finally, metabolism of the intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, cangrelor, is independent of hepatic function, therefore a drug interaction is not expected (78).",

In addition to antiviral medications, numerous immune-modulating and secondary medications to prevent complications that could arise from COVID-19 are currently being investigated. Chloroquine, which has been used as an antimalarial agent, blocks virus infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and has been demonstrated in vitro to have inhibitory activity in SARS-CoV-2 (80,81). Chloroquine and the closely related hydroxychloroquine have the potential for intermediate-to-delayed myocardial toxicity. Risk factors include long-term exposure (>3 months), higher weight-based dose, pre-existing cardiac disease, and renal insufficiency (82). Chloroquine cardiac toxicity presents as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or conduction abnormalities thought to be due to intracellular inhibition of lysosomal enzymes in the myocyte (82,83). In addition, due to effects of chloroquine on CYP2D6 inhibition, beta-blockers metabolized via CYP2D6 (such as metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, or labetalol) can have increased concentration of drug requiring careful monitoring for heart rate and blood pressure shifts. Lastly, both agents are associated with a conditional risk of torsade des pointes in patients with electrolyte abnormalities or with concomitant use of QT-interval\u2013prolonging agents. Short-term exposure to these agents, as would be expected in treatment of COVID-19, confers lower risk of these dose-duration\u2013dependent side effects.",

Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously recommended airborne precautions for the care of patients with COVID-19, this recommendation was recently changed such that only patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures require airborne isolation. Recommendations made by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for personal protective equipment (PPE) are in agreement that standard, contact precautions with face mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves are necessary (53).

Thorough infection prevention and control measures specific to the procedural cardiology specialties must be considered in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such procedures are associated with the small but quantifiable risk of complications and patient deterioration. In the event of a cardiac arrest, efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation causing aerosolized pathogens could result in the wide dissemination of virus particles to clinicians, health care workers, and other patients. One measure that may help protect health care workers in the setting of cardiac arrest and chest compressions is the use of external mechanical compression devices to minimize direct contact with infected patients. Another important consideration for the catheterization laboratory is appropriate post-intervention cleaning of all equipment potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. The necessary downtime required for cleaning may seriously affect the availability of catheterization laboratory-based treatments for other patients. As such, many hospitals are minimizing or cancelling elective procedures during the growth phase of the outbreak. Another consideration is the fact that catheterization laboratories and operating rooms are typically configured with positive pressure ventilation, and there have been reports of centers in China converting such facilities to negative pressure isolation in the setting of COVID-19 (89). Guidance and recommendations in this space will be forthcoming from interventional communities, including the American College of Cardiology and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (53).",

Overall, as CV health care workers are on the front lines treating COVID-19-infected patients, all possible measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of exposure (90). Health care workers are at elevated risk for contracting this virus, as demonstrated by Wu et al. (16), noting 1,716 of the 44,672 infected individuals (3.8%) were health care workers. This fact emphasizes the need for self-protection with PPE before caring for potentially exposed COVID-19 patients and provides further rationale for delaying elective procedures. In teaching hospitals, it is imperative to minimize exposure among trainees and nonessential staff (e.g., medical students) not only for their own safety and that of their patients, but also for conservation of PPE and for avoiding the unnecessary increase in the number of asymptomatic vectors. Finally, transmission between health care workers is also a major concern, especially in the setting of emergency or suboptimal logistics, or when devices for PPE have become scarce.",

One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already used by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. Although there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine, such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (91). Other essential principles are to minimize nonessential/nonurgent in-person health care worker-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e., social distancing) and limit elective cardiac catheterization, operating room, and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personnel should be kept to a minimum.",

Additionally, given the clear implications of this pandemic on CV care, numerous societies have already weighed in with guidance statements, which are summarized in Table 7\n. The American College of Cardiology Clinical Bulletin provides a practical clinical summary about key implications and recommendations for CV care of COVID-19 patients (93). The European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension and European Society of Hypertension statements acknowledge the questions regarding ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in the setting of COVID-19 patients (94,95).

At the same time, provisions for general health services for acute and severe chronic illnesses must be maintained. Specifically, regarding CV care, as the pandemic surges, hospitals may prioritize the treatment of severe and high-risk patients and enact policy to prevent overwhelming of the health care system by the \u201cworried well.\u201d Given concerns of hospitals exceeding capacity, specific protocols will need to be developed for the care of CV patients while preserving limited in-patient resources and minimizing health care worker and patient exposures. There are reports of individual centers developing alternate ST-segment elevation MI pathways in the setting of the COVID-19 crisis, such as using fibrinolytic therapy if delays to primary percutaneous coronary intervention are anticipated when hospitals are at capacity or staffing for the catheterization lab is inadequate (51). A recent report from China also suggests substantial delays in door-to-device time in patients presenting with STEMI during the COVID-19 outbreak (99). Additionally, repurposing cardiac ICUs as medical ICUs for the care of patients with COVID-19 will likely become necessary, but this may limit the quality of specialty care for CV patients. Given the need for ICU beds after cardiac surgery, medical management or percutaneous interventional approaches may need to be preferentially considered for urgent scenarios that cannot wait (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention rather than coronary artery bypass graft surgery or transcatheter valve solutions rather than surgery) to minimize ICU bed utilization. Furthermore, as mentioned, appropriate use and careful selection of ECMO-appropriate patients as well as having established ECMO protocols for COVID-19 patients are important strategies to consider (60).",
