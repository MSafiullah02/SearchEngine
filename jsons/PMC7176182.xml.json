There are two traditional classes of fluids, crystalloids & colloids (see Tables 14.5 and 14.6):\n\nCrystalloids are the fluids of choice for most minor procedures. They are sterile aqueous solutions which may contain glucose, various electrolytes, organic salts, and nonionic compounds. Some examples of these solutes are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, and sodium gluconate. The fluids themselves are known colloquially as normal saline, Ringer\u2019s Lactate, Normosol-R\u00ae, etc. Table 14.5 lists the ingredients and characteristics of some commonly used IV fluids; Table 14.6 lists typical practical applications of these fluids in routine anesthetic care.\nColloids are aqueous solutions of derivatized human serum protein macromolecules (albumin 5% or Plasmanate); or carbohydrate macromolecules (Hetastarch). They are prepared so as to be nonimmunogenic and noninfectious. Because of their component solute sodium chloride, they have tonicity and osmolality like crystalloid solutions. But additionally, their macromolecule solute components give them oncotic pressure similar to serum. The result is that these solutions remain in the intravascular space longer (hours to days) than do crystalloids (minutes to hours).\n\n\n\n",

If it is greater than 40 mm Hg, then the patient has respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis is caused by excess dissolved CO2 in the blood, due to either inadequate ventilation of CO2 out of the lungs or excess production of CO2 in the body. There are several possible underlying causes: hypoventilation, which is decreased minute ventilation (decreased respiratory rate or decreased tidal volume); obstruction of the small airways (COPD, asthma); overdosage of alcohol, sedatives, opioid medications; or neuromuscular disease (like myasthenia gravis). Or, overproduction of CO2 may be from hyperthermia or overfeeding.\nIf the PaCO\n2 is normal or slightly decreased, then the patient has a metabolic acidosis.

All four have the common etiology of bicarbonate loss. Therefore, the treatment of metabolic acidosis is the administration of intravenous bicarbonate solutions or a precursor: lactate, citrate, or acetate.\nIf the pH is greater than 7.45 (recall that normal pH is 7.35-7.45) then the patient has alkalemia:Look at the PaCO2 as before. If it is less than 40 mm Hg, then the patient has respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by decreased levels of dissolved CO2 in the blood, due to either hyperventilation of CO2 out of the lungs or decreased production of CO2 in the body. There are several possible underlying causes: central or CNS-induced hyperventilation, which is increased minute ventilation (increased respiratory rate and/or increased tidal volume), usually from anxiety or a CNS lesion; the respiratory stimulus of altitude; pregnancy; or too much mechanical ventilation. Alternately, underproduction of CO2 may be from hypothermia or muscle relaxation from nondepolarizing muscle relaxant drugs. One can correct respiratory alkalosis by adjusting ventilation or treating anxiety with sedatives.\nIf the PaCO\n2 is normal or slightly increased, then the patient has a metabolic alkalosis. This is caused by one of several causes: vomiting or loss of protons in gastric secretions owing to nasogastric or orogastric suction (classically, in the face of gastric outlet obstruction); diuretic use (classically after heavy furosemide diuresis in the postoperative period - especially after cardiac surgery); antacid use; or hyperaldosteronism. Metabolic alkalosis needs to be corrected because the condition predisposes to dysrhythmias, cerebral vasoconstriction, and coronary vasoconstriction. Also, in mechanically ventilated patients, the condition leads to a vexing secondary effect: the retention of CO2 in the blood, which makes weaning from mechanical ventilation more troublesome in some patients. One corrects metabolic alkalosis by simply infusing normal saline, potassium chloride, or both, intravenously, or, in severe cases, dilute hydrochloric acid is carefully infused centrally. Acetazolamide may also be used if the patient can\u2019t tolerate the increased volume load of intravenous solutions.\n",

Transfusion may be done prior to surgery to replace RBC volume in acutely or chronically anemic patients. It is used during and after surgery to replace traumatic, intraoperative, or postoperative losses of red blood cells. In cases of coagulopathy, it is done to replace coagulation factors and thereby, restore hemostasis. In autoimmune or dilutional thrombocytopenia, transfusion of platelets may at least partly correct these conditions and allow thrombosis to occur normally. In cases of platelet inactivity due to disease or medications (e.g., NSAIDs), a small amount of platelets (one unit rather than 6 pooled units) can serve as a catalyst and initiate platelet thrombus formation and achieve the first steps of hemostasis. Finally, long after surgery, or in protracted illnesses or recuperation, it is often necessary to give RBC when a critical anemic threshold is met.",

Also, hypertensive patients may still be hypovolemic. \ncRequires central venous line access. Values noted are approximate; follow trends in CVP rather than absolute values. \ndThis is affected by many other factors besides volume: ADH secretion, diuretics, intrinsic renal function, etc. \neHR variability with volume status is best seen in young healthy awake patients. It is not well seen in elderly, deeply anesthetized or beta-blocked or calcium-channel blocked patients. Nor is it seen in patients with intrinsic nodal or conduction system disease. \nfHypovolemic patients become hypotensive with even small amounts or concentrations of anesthetics. \ngTilting the patient\u2019s body or trunk \u201chead up\u201d when initially supine will result in hypotension if hypovolemic; less so if hypervolemic. \nhBase excess or bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) measurements if acidotic (less than \u22122 (BE) or less than 22 (HCO3\u2212) suggest hypovolemia and hypoperfusion leading to lactate accumulation in the blood. This rule presupposes no other cause of acidosis besides hypovolemia. \niRequires an arterial line for instantaneous pressure (variability with respiration) or sampling of arterial blood (base excess or HCO3\u2212). \nHow to use Table\n14.2\n: Each clinical variable in the top row is easy to assess. The table describes signs of hypo-, euvolemia, and hypervolemia. Exceptions exist for each of the above rules; they are for approximate assessment of volume status. More than one variable typically follows during anesthesia, and they usually confirm each other.",
