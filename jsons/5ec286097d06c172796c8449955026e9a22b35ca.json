In the case of the Ebola rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine developed by Merck, approval by regulatory authorities took years to achieve, and concerns about the ability to rapidly scale-up manufacturing in response to a worsening Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo prompted discussions about reducing the vaccine dosage or using the vaccines sparingly [5] .

Countries with sufficient resources need to invest in new technologies, processes, and governance to be able to rapidly immunize a large proportion of the global population. Three interrelated approaches would permit rapid scale-up of vaccine manufacturing. First, the continued refinement and use of platform technologies can shorten the pre-clinical phase of development [9] . Indeed, annual seasonal influenza vaccines are rapidly developed from a platform that requires replacement of a subsection of the vaccine matched to the circulating strain(s). From a more technologically advanced perspective, vaccine approaches such as viral-vector, peptide-based, DNA-and mRNA-based vaccines may offer true \"plug-and-play\" capabilities and thus appear to be a particularly promising platform technology [9] .",

This practice is well understood by vaccinators, familiar to vaccinees, and it will undoubtedly be the one used for any successful COVID-19 vaccine. However, this approach to vaccine administration has drawbacks, as rapidly mobilizing a sufficiently large trained vaccinator workforce is challenging [11] , particularly during a pandemic. We propose that a combination of new technologies and strategies could be implemented to expedite mass vaccination for COVID-19.",

Streamlined Vaccine Administration (SVA), a proposed framework in which vaccine administration may occur without the involvement of a healthcare provider, could enable self-administration or administration facilitated by community health workers. We believe administration techniques not reliant on extensive training can ease staffing constraints associated with mass vaccination. As one example of this emerging public health practice, self-administration has been previously demonstrated to be successful and well tolerated with the use of leave-behind second doses of oral cholera vaccine [13] . However, implementation challenges remain; for instance, self-administration could be associated with a degree of noncompliance or incorrect usage.",

However, the CDC and other public health agencies should assess the feasibility, associated costs, societal acceptability, and implications for public health practice of an SVA-enabled mass vaccination campaign using alternative routes of administration such as oral tablets. This evaluation could include a combination of epidemiologic and economic modeling, operations research, and a social and behavioral health component. We would suggest that this novel approach could improve the reach and timeliness of mass vaccination campaigns across high-, middle-, and low-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and should be supported by governments, researchers, and funders. Such campaigns should ultimately proceed, however, only if the associated vaccines prove to be safe, effective, and logistically feasible to implement.",
