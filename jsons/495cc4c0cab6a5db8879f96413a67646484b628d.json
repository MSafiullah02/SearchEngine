Current phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches typically use consensus sequences, essentially assuming the presence of a single viral strain per host. Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time. Our findings and algorithms will facilitate more detailed evolutionary analyses and contact tracing that specifically account for within-host viral diversity in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as future pandemics.",

            "text": "The current COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic and still keeps spreading, despite extensive mitigation efforts. As of May 7 th , 3.78 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in more than 100 countries, with 269,000 fatalities. A deep understanding of the virus' evolution and transmission patterns is critical to enable effective outbreak control and mitigation strategies. In contrast to the majority of existing studies, that have characterized viral genomes based on consensus sequences, we look into the heterogeneity within individual samples and shared mutational signatures across samples. It is critical to evaluate viral diversity below the consensus level as minor variants may impact the patterns of virulence and person-to-person transmission efficiency. Here, we report a genomic analysis of 621 SARS-CoV-2 samples with high-quality sequencing data and 7,540 samples from the GISAID database with consensus sequences. Although recent studies have looked at within-host diversity of COVID-19 patients (Rose et al., 2020; Ramazzotti et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Karamitros et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020) , this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive analysis at a large scale that attempts to identify genomic signatures of SARS-CoV-2 strains that occur within and across individual hosts. Through genomic signature deconvolution, we identify multiple strains that are present in the global population and find evidence of co-existence of distinct strains within hosts.",

As such, we considered a discovery set of 161 high-quality Illumina samples deposited before April 9 th , 2020 and a validation set with the remaining 460 samples deposited before April 22 nd , 2020 ( Figure 1A ). We developed algorithms to deconvolve the bulk sequencing samples in the discovery set and to subsequently find the proportion of the inferred strains in each SRA sample. The inferred strains were validated against 7,540 GISAID consensus sequences deposited before April 15 th , showing that our strains cover a large fraction (94%) of this database.",

Separate epidemiological analyses showed that strains from Clade 3 have a higher average reproduction number compared to the other clades ( Figure S3 ). At the protein-level we found that the missense mutations considered in this study occur primarily on protein surfaces and are non-deleterious ( Figure 3A ). Finally, our deconvolution approach enabled us to look at viral diversity below the consensus level, identifying hosts with strains from distinct clades as well as multiple cases of recombination ( Figure 4 ). Both these phenomena hint at multistrain infections and/or superinfections. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the transmissibility and mutability of specific strains of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, examining the viral composition of COVID-19 patients below the consensus level will enable more precise contact tracing.",

We define a mutation as subclonal if it has a variant allele frequency (VAF) between 0.05 and 0.95 and is supported by at least 5 variant reads. Importantly, a subclonal mutation is only present in a subsets of viral strains within a host and is thus indicative of the presence of multiple strains within that host. On the other hand, a clonal mutation, i.e. a mutation supported by at least 5 variants and a VAF of at least 0.95, is present among all strains within a host. Strikingly, we found that 388/621 samples (62%) contain subclonal mutations and thus are heterogeneous, with 213/621 samples (34%) containing two or more subclonal mutations ( Figure 1B ).",

We found that our k = 25 strains covered 7,096 sequences (94%) in GISAID with varying proportions across countries ( Figure 2B ).

In particular, all strains from Clade 1 contain mutations C8782T and T28144C, which was previously termed the 'L-strain ' (Tang et al., 2020) .

Then we approximated the immunogenicity of a sample by taking the average of the count of binders for all HLA allele types weighted by the HLA frequencies of the country where the sample is from (Gonzalez-Galarza et al., 2019) . We performed the immunogenicity comparison at the clade level in four major countries (USA, UK, Australia and the Netherlands) with the most GISAID sequences and focused on the clades with at least 50 samples. In the USA, Clade 1 and Clade 3 seem to have fewer binders than Clade 0 and Clade 2, which is correlated with the prevalence of the clades. Similar trends can be found also in the UK, Australia, and Netherlands ( Figure S4D ).",

To investigate the impact of missense mutations on protein structure, we searched the protein databank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) and found three solved structures: nsp12 (Yin et al., 2020), nsp15 (Kim et al., 2020) and the S protein (Walls et al., 2020) . We then used HHpred (S\u00f6ding et al., 2005) to build homology models for the remaining SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among these, we were able to identify high-confidence homologous templates for nsp1, nsp2, nsp13, nsp14 and a domain of PL-PRO (1-111). For the remaining proteins, we collected publicly available protein structure predictions by a variety of protein folding algorithms. In particular, we obtained the predicted structures for the M protein [Feig-lab's refined RaptorX model (Heo and Feig, 2020; K\u00e4llberg et al., 2012) ], N protein [Zhang lab's C-I-TASSER model (Zhang et al., 2020) ], nsp6 [Feig-lab's refined AlphaFold model (Heo and Feig, 2020; Jumper et al., 2020; Senior et al., 2020) ], ORF3a [Feig-lab's refined RaptorX model (Heo and Feig, 2020; K\u00e4llberg et al., 2012) ], ORF8 [Feig lab's model (Heo and Feig, 2020) ], and PL- PRO [1260 PRO [ -1945 Feig-lab's refined RaptorX model (Heo and Feig, 2020; K\u00e4llberg et al., 2012) ]. We were able to map 26 missense mutations to these structures, except one mutation on the S protein (R682W) which is not solved. Figure 3A shows mutations on solved structures and high-quality homology models. We found that 24 out of 26 mutations are near or on the surface of these proteins ( Figure 3B ). The impact of 25 surface mutations on the stability of protein structures, calculated with the FoldX forcefield (Delgado et al., 2019) , are very small (i.e. \u2206\u2206G < 3 Kcal/mol), indicating that these mutations are not deleterious and that these amino acid changes with little impact on the protein structure were likely to be transmitted. Among the mutations on solved structures or high-quality models, we found that Strain 1-3's signature includes two mutations on the same protein nsp13 (P504L and Y541C). This protein is a helicase and leads the replication and transcription complex to unwind duplex RNA and DNA, in addition to its function in viral self-reproduction (Yu et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2019) . To investigate the role of the two mutations in nucleic acid binding, we took the homology model of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, which has 100% amino-acid sequence identity with the SARS-CoV nsp13 structure template, and performed docking with double-stranded DNA and singlestranded DNA. Strikingly, although the two surface mutations, P504L and Y541C, are not in direct contact (C-\u03b2 distance \u2248 19 Angstrom), they are likely to jointly coordinate the binding to double-stranded nucleic acid as well as single-stranded nucleic acid ( Figure 3 and Figure S4D ). These results are consistent with the hydrogen/deuterium exchange differences and electrophoretic mobility shift assay performed on SARS-CoV nsp13 (Jia et al., 2019) .",

These samples have at least two mutations from strains belonging to distinct clades such that the sum of their VAFs is more than 1. When this happens, there must be a strain in the sample that harbors both mutations. This is a direct consequence of the pigeon-hole principle. We observed this phenomenon in 16 SRA samples. In addition to recombination, there are several other explanations for the presence of these mutations in the same strain such as parallel evolution, back mutations or sequencing errors. We can rule out sequencing errors due to our stringent criteria for selecting the mutations (see STAR Methods). If the presence of many mutations in a sample need to be attributed to homoplasy (parallel evolution or back mutations) then a single recombination event is a more parsimonious explanation. We considered a sample as having strong evidence of putative recombination if the number of such mutations in the sample is three or more. An example of such a sample, SRR11410536 from the USA, is shown in Figure 4B . This sample has mutations from two separate clades -five mutations from Clade 1 and three mutations from Clade 3. Due to the high VAF values of these mutations (close to 1 for mutations from Clade 1 and more than 0.1 for mutations from Clade 3), we inferred that at least one strain present in this sample must contain all these mutations concurrently. The strain that contains all the mutations from Clade 1 present in this sample is Strain 1-3. One possible scenario is that this sample contains a descendant of Strain 1-3 that has the three additional mutations from Clade 3 due to parallel evolution. However, a more parsimonious explanation would be a single recombination event between Strain 1-3 and a strain that contains the three mutations from Clade 3 present in this sample, such as Strain 3-1 or Strain 3-2. A total of 8 SRA samples show similarly strong evidence of putative recombination (Table S1 ). Viral diversity within a host can arise due to within-host evolution after infection by a single strain, or a single infection event composed of multiple genetically-distinct strains (multi-strain infections) or multiple, separate infection events (superinfections). Figure S5A shows that there are 19 mutations (out of 43 mutations considered in our analysis) that are present subclonally in more than 5 SRA samples. While the shared subclonal mutations could have arisen independently in multiple samples due to parallel evolution, a more parsimonious explanation is the transmission of multiple strains through multi-strain infections and/or superinfections. This concept was first introduced in cancer genomics to test for the presence of complex patterns of seeding in metastasis, such as polyclonal seeding and re-seeding (Brastianos et al., 2015; El-Kebir et al., 2018) . Indeed, our method inferred the co-occurrence of multiple strains in the SRA samples, shown in Figure S5E , which include strains that have high support in the GISAID samples ( Figure 2 ). This observation, together with the 67 multi-clade mixture and recombination samples, point towards multi-strain and/or superinfections occurring in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Fourth, the strains inferred for each infected host can improve the reconstruction of the transmission history using methods that support multiple samples per host and multi-strain infections (De Maio et al., 2018; Sashittal and El-Kebir, 2020) . Finally, we expect more precise contact tracing when one takes within-host diversity into account. shown. (C) In the STRAIN DECONVOLUTION problem, we are given the variant allele frequency (VAF) matrix F , containing the VAF of every mutation in each sample, and a number k of strains to be inferred. Our goal is to infer the genotype matrix B and mixture matrix U such that F \u2248 BU , thus elucidating strains that occur within and across COVID-19 hosts along with their sample-specific proportions. (D) The phylogenetic tree on the 17 strains inferred using the discovery set and validated against the GISAID sequences in the validation set. We identify four distinct clades in the tree (colors) with distinct characteristics in terms of geographical and temporal spread, transmittability and mutability. See also Figures S1 and S2.",

We used the Illumina sequencing samples deposited before April 9 th , 2020 as the discovery dataset to identify strains that occur within and across hosts by solving the STRAIN DECONVOLUTION problem. Specifically, we imposed the following criteria for a sample to be included in the discovery set (i) it must contain at least one mutation that is also present in another sample in the discovery set, (ii) it must have at least one subclonal mutation (i.e. its variant allele frequency greater than 0.05 and less than 0.95) and (iii) it must be from a unique host. After we removed samples that do not pass these criteria, 161 SRA samples with SNVs at 97 positions were kept as the discovery set for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral strains. The validation set is comprised of 460 SRA samples deposited in the SRA database before April 22 nd .

We then ran a sweep on the number of strains k \u2208 {5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50} and solve the STRAIN DECONVOLUTION problem for each k independently with 25 random initializations until convergence. Figure S1D shows the convergence of our method for increasing number of iterations. The improvement of reconstruction error started to be saturated at k = 25 or 30. To be parsimonious, we selected k = 25 and identified 25 strains with 43 of the 97 mutations covered.

Supplementary Data 1 (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University\" (Dong et al., 2020) . These cases are annotated by the country of origin as well. In order to infer the reproduction number for a given clade, we need to find the number of confirmed cases infected with strains of that clade for each day. We approximated this by multiplying the number of confirmed cases on a given day by the proportion of GISAID sequences mapped to some strain of a given clade on that day. The underlying assumption here is that the GISAID sequences have been uniformly sampled from the infected population. Therefore, to avoid sampling errors, we restricted our analysis to 6 countries (Australia, Netherlands, Spain, China, USA and United Kingdom) that have at least 2 clades such that more than 50 GISAID sequences map to a strain from those clades. the infectivity of a person after time s since infection is given by w(s). The function w is known as the infectivity distribution. The reproduction number R 0 (t) at any time t is estimated by the ratio of the number of new infections to the total infectiousness of the infected individuals at time t. The total infectiousness at any time is highly dependent on the infectivity distribution of the disease. In practice it is approximated by distribution of the serial interval, which is the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases.

(B) We show the example of a sample that has a strong evidence for recombination between strains from Clade 1 and Clade 3. The sample has 5 mutations from Clade 1 and 3 mutations from Clade 3. An alternative explanation with no recombination event would require parallel evolution of Strain 1-3 with the three mutations from Clade 3.
