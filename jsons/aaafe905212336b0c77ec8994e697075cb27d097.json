            "text": "Between 28 June 2009 and 31 January 2010, ILI and virologic surveillance in China estimated that around 0.77 million A(H1N1) pdm09 infection visited ILI sentinels (the number of A(H1N1) pdm09 infections that visited ILI sentinels in any given week was estimated as the product of ILI counts and percentage of virologic specimens that were positive for A(H1N1) pdm09). Nationwide serosurvey in China estimated that the number of A(H1N1) pdm09 infections between June 2009 and January 2010 was 207.7 million of whom 50% were symptomatic 1 . These data together suggested that around 0.75% of A(H1N1) pdm09 symptomatic infections sought medical care at ILI sentinels. The ILI surveillance system has not changed substantially and only covers a small fraction of the hospitals in affected regions of China. Specifically, the current ILI sentinel network comprises 554 of 20291 hospitals in China, and crude scaling by hospital counts suggests that 0.75% \u00d7 20291/554 = 27% of A(H1N1)pdm09 symptomatic infections sought medical care , which is a plausible estimate. The proportion of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections that sought medical care was likely to have been higher than assumed here because (i) laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases seemed to have faster and more severe disease progression than A(H1N1)pdm09 and (ii) residents of the highly developed cities of Shanghai and Nanjing were more likely to seek medical care than the general population of China. As such, our estimates of the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections in this method could be interpreted as upper bounds, although the true number of A(H7N9) cases could be even higher if there has been substantial underdetection of cases in some areas. Note that because it was likely that some A(H7N9) symptomatic infections had not sought medical care, our estimates of the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections in this method could be interpreted as lower bounds.",

Online Nanjing Health Statistics (http://www.njh.gov.cn/html/wstj/2013/05/131122040107.shtml) indicated that the daily average number of outpatient visits in all departments among all hospitals in Nanjing was 94,125 in 2012. Because outpatient visits stratified by departments were not available from this database, we assumed that the proportion of outpatient visits in the internal medicine, pediatrics and emergency departments was similar to that in Shanghai, i.e. 40%. The China CDC ILI surveillance database indicated that the daily average number of outpatient visits in the internal medicine, pediatrics and emergency departments in the ILI sentinels in Shanghai and Nanjing were 23,870 and 4,070, respectively, between 1 January and 16 May 2013.",
