The recent application of molecular biological approaches t o the study of mycoviral dsRNAs, and the improvements in DNA-mediated fungal transformation systems, have allowed a clearer understanding of the molecular biology of mycoviruses to emerge. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the genome organization and expression strategies of the yeast L-A virus and the unencapsidated RNA virus associated with hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus. These recent advances in biochemical and molecular characterization of the genomes of fungal viruses and associated satellite dsRNAs as they relate to the biological properties of these viruses and to their interactions with their hosts are the focus of this chapter. 11.

Moreover, they also encode the RNA polymerase protein required for the replication of both the M dsRNA and their own genomic dsRNA. The helper virus dsRNA and M dsRNA are separately packaged in capsids coded for by the helper virus. From the virological point of view, the killer system in each of the yeast and smut fungi is comprised of a totivirus with associated satellite dsRNAs. The monopartite nature of the genome of the helper virus, particularly in the case of the yeast killer system, is well documented, and its structure, organization, and expression strategy have been elucidated in detail. Therefore, the use of the terms \"satellite viruses\" or \"killer viruses with segmented genomes\" to refer to the killer system or to the viruses associated with the killer strains of the yeast and smut is contrary to the accepted terminology, and leads to confusion as to the nature of the genome. In satellite viruses the RNA codes for its own coat protein, whereas in the satellite RNAs the RNA becomes packaged in capsid coded for by the helper virus. Thus, in killer strains, infections with totiviruses are associated with satellite dsRNAs, not satellite viruses. Because the satellite RNAs that encode the killer toxins are not required for the replication of the helper totiviruses, they do not comprise parts of the essential genomes. Therefore, it is inappropriate from the virological point of view to refer to the viruses associated with killer fungi as having segmented or multipartite genomes.

Particles containing one or two molecules of M dsRNA have been isolated from cells, as indicated earlier.

Present evidence supports the following virus assembly model, which is based on the nature of the 170-kDa protein: The ORF2 domain of the 170-kDa protein specifically recognizes and binds to the viral (+) ssRNA. The major coat protein (+) and (-1 strand RNA syntheses take place within the virions.

Both M and X dsRNAs are less than half the size of L-A dsRNA, and depend on it for viral proteins. As in the replication cycle of L-A dsRNA, the i+ ) strand RNA of X or M dsRNAs are packaged and replicated. Because the virions are designed to accommodate one L-A dsRNA molecule per particle, the newly synthesized (+) strand RNAs are not extruded.

Elimination of the internal site reduces the template activity 5t o 10-fold.

However, establishment of an intermolecular hydrogen bonding between these RNAs restored the replication-enhancing activity of the internal site . This finding is consistent with a model in which L-A's RDRP interacts first with the internal site and then with the 3'-end site either by looping or by a local dissociation-reassociation mechanism. Furthermore, it clearly eliminates the anchored tracking and sliding models which require continuity of the RNA molecule between these two cis sites .

In these studies a cDNA fragment comprising the putative frame-shift site in L-A dsRNA was inserted in expression and transcription vectors and tested for its ability to direct frame-shifting in both homologous and heterologous eukaryotic systems a s well as in prokaryotes. Deletion analysis and sitedirected mutagenesis indicated that a sequence of 71 nt (nt 1952-2022) , including both the pseudoknot and slippery sites, is sufficient for frame-shifting. Analysis of the slippery site (G GGU UUA) in L-A dsRNA indicated that any 3 identical bases (including C CC) in the first triplet were sufficient for efficient frame-shifting (Dinman et al., 1991) . This is unlike the model of Jacks et al. (1988a1, which stipulates that X (in the heptamer X XXY YYZ) can only be A, U, or G. Furthermore, as long as base pairing was possible in the nonwobble bases, some frame-shifting was detected. The sequence requirements of the second triplet (U UU) were more stringent. Like the retroviruses, only triplets of A and U yielded efficient frame-shifting, and the identity of the 3 bases was required. Dinman et al. (1991) reasoned that inefficient frame-shifting with C CC or G GG in the second triplet is due to the higher energy required to unpair the tRNA that is properly paired to CCX or GGX rather than to a reluctance to repair in the shifted -1 frame.

In this regard it is of interest to note that, like M dsRNA, a 530-bp deletion mutant (X dsRNA) that is derived entirely from L-A dsRNA requires all of the M A K genes tested.

For example, the KEXl and KEX2 genes, which were shown to be required for the production of the yeast mating pheromone a-factor (Dmochowska et al., 1987; Julius et al., 1984) , have been originally identified because they are essential for the production of active K1 toxin (Wickner and Leibowitz, 1976a) . The KEX2 gene encodes a membrane-bound endopeptidase (Kex2p) specific for cleaving the carboxyl side of pairs of basic amino acid residues (e.g., -Lys-Arg, -Arg-Arg). The KEXl gene encodes a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase (Kexlp) specific for removal of the flanking basic amino acids from the processed intermediates (Dmochowska et al., 1987; Julius et al., 1984) . Thus, studying the yeast killer system has allowed the definition of the components of the protease processing system, the first for any eukaryotes . Detailed analysis of toxin processing in the yeast killer system has also indicated its remarkable similarity to that observed in the maturation of many eukaryotic hormones and neuropeptides.

The calculated sizes of the proteins are 35 and 38 kDa, respectively. Full-length in uitro transcripts of virion M1 or M2 dsRNA can be purified to near-homogeneity by chromatography on oligo(dT1cellulose. Although these transcripts lack a 3'-terminal poly(A) tract, they bind very tightly to oligo(dT)-cellulose or poly(U)-Sepharose due to its internal poly(A) tract (Hannig et al., 1986; . The M28 dsRNA appears to lack such an AU-rich region, since oligo(dT),, could not be used to prime cDNA synthesis from either denatured M28 dsRNA or from in uitro-synthesized transcripts of virion M28 dsRNA (Schmitt and Tipper, 1990) . Both M1 and M2 dsRNAs contain similar hairpin structures at their 5' terminus of (+) strand ( Fig. 11 ) in regions which also include the initiating AUG of the first long ORF . The inability to obtain full-length cDNA clones of M dsRNA is probably due to the presence of such highly stable secondary structure a t the ends of the molecules. In a cell-free system the in uitro transcript of M1 dsRNA or denatured M1 dsRNA prime the synthesis of a 35-kDa polypeptide, denoted preprotoxin (Bostian et al., 1980a; Welsh and Leibowitz, 1982) . Leibowitz et al. (19881, p. 143, courtesy of Marcel Dekker, Inc.] Hussain and Leibowitz (1986) developed a yeast translation system and showed that isolated (+I strand RNA or denatured M1 or dsRNA can be translated in a homologous system to produce preprotoxin. The yeast translation system was subsequently used to study the mechanism of translation initiation and the regulatory signals that may control gene expression a t that stage. Because M1 and M2 dsRNA molecules contain self-complementary sequences near the 5' termini, (+> strand RNA has extensive 5'-terminal stem-loop structures. The presence of such secondary structures has been confirmed by nuclease sensitivity studies . These secondary structures involve the regions surrounding the AUG initiating the first long ORF, which, in the case of M1, encodes the 35-kDa preprotoxin (Bostian et al., 1984) . No such secondary structure occurs around the 5'-proximal AUG in the (+) strand of L-A dsRNA . Because the regions surrounding the 5'-terminal structures of the transcripts of M1 or M2 contain complementary sequences to the 3' termini of the yeast 18 S and 5.8 S rRNA molecules (Fig. 111 , it was proposed that rRNA hybridization to these complementary sites could weaken the stability of the 5'-terminal hairpin, and as a consequence facilitate its function as a translational template (Leibowitz et al., 1988) . Using the elongation inhibitor anisomycin in the yeast in uitro translation system, Leibowitz et al., (1988) demonstrated that the translation initiation complexes can be isolated and the possible role of RNA-RNA base pairing in these complexes may then be tested by cross-linking, an approach previously used with the wheat germ system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 364, "text": "al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 365, "end": 397, "text": "Meskauskas and Citavicius, 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 767, "end": 788, "text": "(Hannig et al., 1986;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 998, "end": 1024, "text": "(Schmitt and Tipper, 1990)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1536, "text": "(Bostian et al., 1980a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1563, "text": "Welsh and Leibowitz, 1982)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1631, "text": "Leibowitz et al.

Assembly of this glucan receptor requires a set of nuclear KRE (killer resistance) genes Meaden et al., 1990) . kre mutants are resistant to K1 toxin, but when kre mutant cells are converted to spheroplasts, they are sensitive to the toxin, suggesting the existence of a second step. Because the killer phenotype allows the selection of resistant mutants with glucan defects, Bussey and co-workers Bussey et al., 1994; Meaden et al., 1990 ) are utilizing this system to explore synthesis of the cell wall receptor. The products of three genes, KREl, KRE5, and KREG, are required for the sequential assembly of (1+6)-p-~-glucan. Although the precise biochemical function of the KRE gene products remains obscure, P-glucan synthesis and assembly are complex and require many proteins in an apparently sequential process that traverses the yeast secretory pathway. Physiological studies of K1 toxin action suggest that the toxin perturbs an energized plasma membrane state, causing ion leakage and subsequent cell death (de la Pena et al., 1981) . By using the patchclamp technique, it has recently been shown that the toxin forms voltage-independent cation channels in sensitive yeast spheroplasts and in artificial liposomes. Such channels are likely to be the basis of toxin action (Martinac et al., 1990) . A possible functional assignment of domains of the K1 killer toxin has been suggested on the basis of the primary structure of the toxin subunits (Bostian et al., 1984) . The a-subunit contains two highly hydrophobic regions (residues 72-91 and 112-127) separated by a short hydrophilic region. This secondary structure suggested that the a-subunit may be responsible for ion channel formation. In contrast, the @-subunit is hydrophilic and lacks potential membrane-spanning regions. Therefore, by analogy t o the abrin and ricin classes of toxins (Olsnes and Phil, 1973) , the P-subunit has been proposed (Bostian et al., 1984) to bind to the (1+6)-p-~-glucan cell wall receptor. Published mutations in the toxin gene often lead to failure to secrete significant levels of toxin, making the analysis of phenotypes difficult (Boone et al., 1986; Sturley et al., 1986) .

Resistance to each toxin is conferred by a nuclear gene for each of the three toxins, and in the case of KP1, but not KP4 and KP6, a cytoplasmic immunity factor (dsRNA of viral satellite origin) may also be involved (Peery et al., 1982; Puhalla, 1968) . The alleles conferring resistance are recessive, indicating that a loss of function or a cellular component can lead to the inability to interact with the toxin . The smut killer system is more complicated than that of the yeast; as many as eight dsRNA segments can occur in an individual killer strain . The dsRNAs are packaged in 43-nm capsids which have a major CP with an estimated size of 75 kDa (Bozarth et al., 1981) . Each killer strain contains one or more representatives of three size classes of dsRNA segments: heavy (HI, medium (MI, and light (L). The original dsRNA patterns described for the three types of killer strains were as follows: P1, with six segments (Hl, H2, M1, M2, M3, and L); P4, with seven segments (H1, H2, H3, H4, M2, M3, and L), and P6, with five segments (H1, H2, M2, M3, and L). Variations in these basic patterns of the smut killer strains have been noted as a result of the loss or addition of specific segments. As a consequence of such instability, some of the new strains isolated proved to be quite useful in mapping viral functions . For example, the P6 strain that is currently in use in a major study involving the KP6 toxin contains only H1, M2, and L dsRNAs . The H dsRNAs encode the CP and are packaged singly. The M segments which code for toxin production may be encapsidated singly or in combinations of multiple segments (Bozarth et al., 1981) .

Additional similarities between p29 and HC-Pro include the occurrence of conserved amino acid sequences around the essential Cys and His residues, the nature of the cleavage dipeptides, and the distances between the essential residues and the cleavage sites. The sequence surrounding the essential Cys residues for both proteases is GYCY, while the consensus sequence flanking the essential His residue of HC-Pro is HVV/LD, and that for p29 is HV-VVD (Fig. 15 ).

Considering the relative organization of the conserved domains within the HYPV-713 and potyvirus-encoded polyproteins (Fig. 141 , Koonin et al. (1991) proposed that HYPV dsRNA might have evolved by rearrangement of a (+ strand RNA potyvirus-like genome. The following events were perceived to have taken place: (1) transposition of the helicase gene; (2) duplication of the sequence encoding the protease domain of the HC; (3) deletion of the sequence encoding the protease domain of the nuclear inclusion protein Nla; (4) deletion of the CP gene; and (5) emergence of the termination codon separating the two ORFs. Because of their intracellular mode of transmission, fungal viruses can dispense with a n extracellular route of infection and the required packaging function. In the absence of a CP, the ratio of the ssRNA genome to the replicative form could have been altered so that the dsRNA form predominated. Because gene module shuffling has been recognized as a major trend in the evolution of (+) strand viruses, Koonin et al. (1991) proposed that a similar process may account for the evolution of a dsRNA virus-like genetic element from a (+ 1 strand RNA virus. Arguments against this proposal would include the fact that the predicted 12.5-kb single-stranded genomic RNA has never been detected in the infected cells.

Two of the S dsRNA species (S2 and S3) contained, within the boundaries of the breakpoint, additional sequence information consisting of 42 or 95 bp that appeared unrelated to the L dsRNA. reasoned that the characteristics of the S1 dsRNA breakpoint are consistent with a copy-choice model for the generation of S dsRNA in which the synthesis of a nascent RNA strand is interrupted, possibly by secondary structure constraints. This is followed by dissociation of the complex, reassociation with a second template, mediated by the sequence homology between the 3' end of the nascent RNA and a region of the template 3' of the breakpoint, and completion of the synthesis of the nascent RNA strand. The internally deleted RNA then serves as a template for subsequent RNA synthesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C.

The influence of M and S dsRNAs on the replication and expression of L dsRNA and their contributions to the hypovirulence phenotype are difficult to assess because of the lack of conventional infectivity assays.

PCR mapping indicated that about 3.5 kbp of each terminus appeared to be conserved intact . Thus, the presence of M dsRNA should not affect the accumulation of ORF A-specified polypeptides, but would be expected to impact on the synthesis and processing of ORF B-specified polypeptides. On the other hand, the accumulation of S dsRNAs may interfere with the synthesis of L and M dsRNAs by outcompeting these dsRNAs for the limited RNA polymerase sites.

This was the first report of virus particles in association with a fungus. Because the nature of the genomes of the viruses involved was not elucidated, and because apparently healthy mushrooms did harbor viruses, earlier infectivity assays were difficult to interpret. Furthermore, precautions against contamination with exogenous spores were not taken. Today, 30 years later, the evidence for viral etiology is stronger, but remains equivocal.

Two major polypeptides of 63 and 66 kDa and a minor one of 129 kDa were detected by SDS-PAGE of the dsRNA-containing fractions of the cesium gradients. Although the nine dsRNAs have unique nucleotide sequences (Harmsen et al., 19891 , three of the segments (Ml, S1, and S2) occur in submolar concentrations and could be satellite dsRNAs (Fig. 17) . The bacilliform particles of the mushroom bacilliform virus (MBV) are not likely to package any of the nine dsRNAs. Highly purified virions of MBV do not contain dsRNA, but rather a 4.4-kb ssRNA that shares no sequence homology with the disease-specific dsRNAs (Romaine and Schlagnhaufer, 1991) . Moreover, MBV has been shown to have a single CP of 24.5 kDa (Tavantzis et al., 1980) . The 25-nm isometric particles, on the other hand, are present in concentrations too low to accommodate the dsRNAs, although it is possible that it encapsidates the three minor dsRNAs. It is noteworthy that the isometric 25-nm particles and the 2.4-kbp dsRNA (L6 segment, Table V and Fig. 17 ) have been reported to occur in healthy tissues (Hicks and Haughton, 1986; Harmsen et al., 1989; Romaine and Schlagnhaufer, 1989) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 201, "text": "Goodin et al.

Examination of the cesium sulfate gradient profile and results of dsRNA and protein analyses of the gradient fractions reveal that at least two broad-density components were resolved: a lighter component of empty capsids and a nucleoprotein component (Goodin et al., 1992) . Judging from the size of the particles (36 nm in diameter), it is highly unlikely that all dsRNAs are packaged together in single particles. More likely, LIV represents a multiparticle system in which the various particle classes have similar densities. Packaging of the dsRNA segments probably occurs by a \"headful-type\" mechanism, in which either various combinations of different dsRNA segments, or single/multiple copies of the individual dsRNAs, dependent on size of segment, are packaged together. The various particle classes are thus predicted to have similar densities, and this is consistent with the results of cesium sulfate density gradient analysis of the purified virions (Goodin et al., 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 158, "text": "(Goodin et al., 19921, it", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 553, "end": 574, "text": "(Goodin et al., 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1285, "text": "(Goodin et al., 1992)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "B.

In the absence of reliable infectivity assays, a molecular approach that combines elucidating the organization and expression strategies of all nine disease-specific dsRNAs of LIV and using transformation vectors to transfer individual viral genes to virus-free host strains may be possible. The recent isolation and characterization of the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase gene from A. bisporus (Harmsen and Wessels, 19941 , and the possible use of the promoter and terminator sequences of this highly expressed gene in constructing transformation vectors, are encouraging in this regard.

The yeast L-A virus is unique among RNA viruses in that template-dependent i n vitro systems are available to examine the intricate details of viral gene expression, replication, and encapsidation. Furthermore, because S. cereuisiae is amenable to genetic manipulation, and the killer phenotype can be easily scored, the yeast killer system is helping t o address questions related to viral interaction with host genes (virus maintenance and antiviral defense mechanisms in eukaryotic cells), protein transport, processing, and secretion, as well as the molecular biology of cell wall synthesis. The isolation of the yeast genes required for viral replication or for antiviral activities has led to the search for counterparts in other systems.

It is anticipated that the information gained from studying the chestnut blight fungus/hypovirus system will be applicable to other systems. The search for totiviruses and associated satellites and killer phenotypes among plant pathogenic fungi should intensify. The strategy of producing transgenic plants in which killer toxins are expressed is currently being pursued as a means of biological control against the smut fungi. If killer systems are found in other plant pathogenic fungi, this strategy should be applicable. Because of recent technological developments in molecular biology and plant transformation and regeneration, the use of molecular approaches for disease control is a reality. At the present time control of plant pathogenic fungi is a formidable task due to the lack of appropriate disease control strategies. In addition to the health hazards and the risks to the environment, the use of fungicides is often cost prohibitive.

M dsRNAs are dependent on the L-A virus for replication and encapsidation. Earlier genetic and biochemical studies have identified at least four types of natural variants of L-A dsRNA (L-A-H, L-A-E, L-A-HN, and L-A-HNB) that carry different combinations of non-Mendelian traits termed [HOKI, [EXLI, \"EX], and [Bl", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "The definitions of[EXL], or excluder of M2 (E), and \"EX], or nonexcluder of M2 (N), are related.

Thus, introducing L-A-E into a strain carrying L-A-H and M2 results in the loss of M2, but introducing L-A-E into a strain having L-A-HN and M2 does not result in loss of M2. showed that L-A-E excludes M2 by lowering the copy number of L-A-H. However, L-A-E does not completely eliminate L-A-H. All wild-type K2 yeast killer strains contain L-A-H and M2 dsRNAs. L-A-H can support M1, and likewise, L-A-HN (the L-A variant present in all K1 wild-type killer strains) can maintain M2, indicating that essentially all L-A variants and M dsRNAs are interchangeable.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "I11 COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PROPERTIES OF PROTEINS PREDICTED FROM NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE OF Leishmania braziliensis VIRUS 1-1 (LRV1-1) AND THE YEAST L-A VIRUS (ScV-L-A)\" ProteinNo. of amino acids Size (kDa) Summarized fromStuart et al.
