Each reaction was prepared using LightCycler 480 Probes Master reaction 51 mix (Roche Diagnostics), 6 \u00b5L of DNA or cDNA template, and target-specific primers and 52 TaqMan probes (Table 2 of main text). Thermocycling began at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 53 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C.

The subscripts L and S refer to the liquid and 188 solid fractions of separated manure, respectively. This mass balance is defined by two equations: 195 To fix this problem, we can rewrite Equations 1 and 2 using two new terms: f L and f S . ",
