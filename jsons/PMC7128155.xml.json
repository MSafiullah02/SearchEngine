They are, along with other peptides with various secondary structures, part of the innate immune system that protects the host in an unspecific manner. The host organism is protected by the interaction of these peptides with the cytoplasmic membranes of micro-organisms, and (in some cases) also by binding bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) (Hancock and Lehrer, 1998). Ultimately, because of problems with increasing microbial resistances towards currently used antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides might be applied as alternative treatments in fighting bacterial infections. Thus, the possible use of antimicrobial peptides as antibiotics is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides target microbe membranes, which differ from membranes of multi-cellular animals. The exterior surface of the bacterial membrane is negatively charged, due to a high proportion of lipids with phosphate head groups. In contrast, the outer leaflet of eukaryotic cells has almost no net charge (Matsuzaki, 1999, Zasloff, 2002). According to the commonly accepted Shai\u2013Matsuzaki\u2013Huang model, the peptides bind to the membrane surface when targeting cell membranes and, after reaching a critical concentration, penetrate the membrane and reach the interior (Brogden, 2005, Jenssen et al., 2006, Shai, 1999, Yang et al., 2000, Zasloff, 2002). Typically, cationic antimicrobial peptides have less than 50 amino acids, an amphipathic character, and are positively charged due to residues such as arginine or lysine. Both the amphipacity and the cationic charge seem to be the crucial properties for the membrane activity and, therefore, the antimicrobial effect of the peptides. Many studies have addressed the killing mechanism of cationic antimicrobial peptides; however, details of the process remain unclear. When a microorganism is attacked by a peptide, the membrane of the target cell is disrupted by pore formation, which leads to collapse of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient and, finally, to cell death (Shai, 1999, Zasloff, 2002). Further action of peptides on intracellular anionic targets during the killing process has been hypothesized (Friedrich et al., 2000) but is yet to be demonstrated.",

            "text": "A particularly rich source of antimicrobial peptides is amphibian skin, where these peptides serve as a first defence mechanism against bacterial infection in this moist environment (Simmaco et al., 2009). Peptidic skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family were among the first to be successfully characterized (Kiss and Michl, 1962). The sequence of the peptide maximin H6 (ILGPVIG TIGNVLGGLL KNL-NH2) was inferred from its cDNA sequence originally isolated from the skin of the toad Bombina maxima (Chinese red-belly toad), where maximin H6 is apparently expressed as part of a precursor protein, together with maximin 7 (Lee et al., 2005). B. maxima has been found to produce a large variety of antimicrobial peptides (Lai et al., 2002b, Lee et al., 2005). Due to its amidated C-terminus, the peptide has an elevated net charge of + 2. The peptides isolated from skin secretions were grouped into two families, maximin and maximin H (Lai et al., 2002b). They are homologous to bombinin and bombinin H, respectively, (isolated from the Bombina species B. orientalis and B. variegata (Gibson et al., 1991, Mangoni et al., 2000, Simmaco et al., 1991)) to which they show structural and high sequential similarities (Lai et al., 2002b). Here, maximin H6 was chosen as an example of cationic \u03b1-helical antimicrobial peptides, as it shows all the typical characteristics of this peptide group; i.e. charge, chain length, amino acid composition and secondary structure. Another important reason for choosing maximin H6 for the present study is its amino acid composition, which is rich in glycine, valine and leucine. These amino acids are relatively affordable in 15N-labeled form, and such isotopically labelled amino acids are necessary for studying the dynamic behaviour of the peptide. Maximin H6 possesses antibacterial and haemolytic activity, as reported for other maximin H peptides (Lai et al., 2002b), and thus can interact with negatively charged and zwitterionic membranes.",

Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was used to mimic an anionic membrane environment, while dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) acted as an uncharged membrane surrogate. The peptide adopts similar \u03b1-helical conformations in its interactions with both detergents, but the structure is more flexible in SDS micelles, as shown by 15N-relaxation measurements. Maximin H6 is bound closer to the micelle surface in SDS compared to DPC, as determined by paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. The helix shows a rotation of \u223c70\u00b0 around its axis between these two membrane mimetics, orienting the consecutive GxxxG motifs found along the backbone further towards the hydrophobic interior. Such an orientation might promote peptide oligomerization in the anionic environment and, thus, could explain the preference of its membrane-lyzing function towards negatively charged membranes.",

Maximin H6 inhibits the growth of E. coli at low peptide concentrations (LC 2.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM) (Table 1\n), which is in accordance with earlier studies of other maximin H peptides (Lai et al., 2002b). Although Lai et al. (Lai et al., 2002b) found that other maximin H peptides have inhibitory effects on gram-positive bacteria this was not true for maximin H6, which shows no detectable activity against B. subtilis and E. caccae (Table 1). Maximin H6 possesses strong haemolytic activity (70% lysis) when assayed against human erythrocytes. This is consistent with the findings for other maximin H peptides lyzing up to 90% of rabbit red blood cells (Lai et al., 2002b). Most naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides do not affect erythrocytes (Shai, 2002), because of their low affinity for zwitterionic membranes, which are the major component of the outer leaflet of red blood cells (Verkleij et al., 1973). However, some cationic peptides still bind and sometimes lyze erythrocytes \u2013probably due to the negatively charged carbohydrate moieties on the cell surface, which consist mainly of glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids (Shai, 2002). The growth of the tested fungal strains of C. parapsilosis and S. cerevisiae was not influenced to any detectable level by maximin H6. According to Shai (Shai, 2002), there is a correlation between the hydrophobicity of the peptide and its ability to self-associate and therefore its antifungal action. Although maximin H6 is hydrophobic and has several Gly residues \u2013 indicating a possible interaction via a GxxxG motif (Unterreitmeier et al., 2007) \u2013 no activity against fungi was found up to peptide concentrations of 1 mM. Thus, of all the organisms tested, maximin H6 only inhibited the growth of gram negative E. coli, and lyzed the relatively fragile erythrocytes. Therefore, maximin H6 is clearly not active against a wide variety of microbes, but is rather specific; probably due to its ability to interact and permeate negatively charged and zwitterionic membranes, with a preference towards simpler bacterial membranes. As most multicellular organisms express cocktails of variously structured antibiotic peptides with a range of inhibition abilities, selectivity for specific microbes was also expected among maximin H peptides.",

Addition of SDS-d\n25 or DPC-d\n38 led to large shift changes, up to concentrations of around 120 mM SDS or 70 mM DPC. Thus, to ensure that all of the peptide is bound to micelles, concentrations of 200 mM SDS or 100 mM DPC were used for all subsequent experiments. The proton, carbon and nitrogen signals of maximin H6 were assigned using TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-13C-HSQC on unlabelled peptide as well as 1H-15N-HSQC and NOESY-1H-15N-HSQC spectra on partially 15N-labelled maximin H6. The 1H-15N-HSQC spectra and fingerprint regions of the TOCSY spectra of maximin H6 in SDS and DPC micelle solutions can be seen in Fig. 1\n. While most resonances have similar chemical shifts in the two systems, indicative of similar three-dimensional structures, the most striking difference is the large difference in the backbone amide protons of Leu2 in the two membrane-mimetics. The corresponding signal is shifted by almost 1 ppm upfield (to lower frequency) in SDS micelles. Backbone amide protons close to the N-terminus are usually found at high frequencies. This is a result of their proximity to the positively charged NH3+ group at the N-terminus. The lower electron density of the NH, especially when it forms an H-bond to the NH3+ group, leads to enhanced chemical shielding and, thus, to higher frequencies. While this is found in neutral DPC micelles (Fig. 1a and b), the shift to lower frequencies in SDS micelles indicates an increased electron density near the N-terminus. We believe that an ionic interaction between the N-terminal NH3+ group with the negatively charged SDS molecules is the reason for this difference in chemical shift. Such an ionic interaction is not possible in the zwitterionic DPC micelles.",

The peptide shows a quite rigid structure between residues 5 and 18 in both micelle systems (high T\n1, low T\n2 and high hetero NOEs) with more flexibility at the N- and C-termini. However, even at the termini, the peptide cannot be described as freely flexible, as such a situation would be characterized by negative {1H}15N-NOEs.

            "text": "To obtain the orientation (tilt and azimuth angles) as well as the immersion depth of maximin H6 in membrane surrogates, we used relaxation enhancements caused by the inert and water-soluble paramagnetic agent Gd(DTPA-BMA) on longitudinal T\n1 relaxation times of NMR detectable signals (Respondek et al., 2007, Zangger et al., 2009). Adding this compound to the solvent renders the environment surrounding the micelles paramagnetic, and leads to relaxation enhancements, which depend on the distance to the surface of the biomolecular assembly (Madl et al., 2009, Madl et al., 2006, Pintacuda and Otting, 2002). Depending on the orientation of an \u03b1-helical peptide, the PREs oscillate with a periodicity of 3.6 residues (Respondek et al., 2007). The azimuth and rotation angles of helical peptides can be obtained from PREs using paramagnetic relaxation wave fitting (Respondek et al., 2007). The corresponding waves of H\u03b1 protons for maximin H6 in DPC and SDS micelles are shown in Fig. 5\n. Only the well-structured helical region from residues Pro4- Gly15 was used for the fitting procedure. While the tilt angles for the peptide in both micelle systems (7\u00b0 in DPC and \u22125\u00b0 in SDS) show orientations basically parallel to the surface, there are significant deviations in the azimuth (rotation) angles. The azimuth angle \u03c1 (the rotation of the first \u03b1-proton of the fitted region) is 80\u00b0 in DPC and 11\u00b0 in SDS micelles. Thus, while in zwitterionic DPC micelle residues G7, N11 and G15 point towards the outside, the helix is rotated by \u223c70\u00b0 in SDS, so that here residues V5, T8 and V12 are furthest away from the hydrophobic interior. Helical-wheel representations corresponding to the obtained azimuth angles (Fig. 6\n) indicate the relative orientation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions as well as the pronounced consecutive GxxxG motif close to the hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic transition. The hydrophobic moment was calculated using the hydrophobicity scales of Wimley and White (Wimley and White, 1996), and is derived from the thermodynamic transfer free energies between water and interface. While the orientation found in DPC micelles is close to what one would expect based on the hydrophobic moment, the orientation in SDS is rotated \u223c70\u00b0 counter-clockwise when viewed from the N-terminus. This places the GxxxG motif further towards the hydrophobic environment, and the hydrophobic side of the peptide is moved slightly closer to the outside of the micelle. GxxxG motifs are involved in transmembrane helix dimerization and oligomerization. They have been found, for example, in the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003, Tamm, 2003), in Alzheimer\u2019s peptides (D\u2019Ursi et al., 2004, Sato et al., 2009), in the SARS coronavirus spike protein transmembrane domain (Arbely et al., 2006), and in the antimicrobial peptide bombinin H2 and H4 (Zangger et al., 2008). Negatively charged SDS micelles are membrane mimetics of prokaryotic cells, and the neutral DPC resembles a situation more similar to eukaryotic cell membranes. Therefore, we believe that the rotation around the helix axis in SDS positions the glycine ridge so that it is more likely to form peptide\u2013peptide interactions. Such peptide aggregation events are necessary for the proposed models of antimicrobial peptide action; i.e., the carpet, barrel-stave or the torroidal pore mechanisms (Shai, 1999). Further insight into the exact mode of binding to a micelle, in particular the immersion depth, can be obtained by the least-squares fitting of all (backbone and sidechain) PREs using the program Parapos (Zangger et al., 2009). We used only the well-structured helical regions (Val5-Asn19) for determining the immersion depths as the first 3\u20134 and last 1 residues show increased flexibility in relaxation measurements. The resulting orientation and location inside their corresponding micelles are shown in Fig. 7\n. Both peptides bind more or less parallel to the surface, and are inserted just below the polar\u2013nonpolar interface. Maximin H6 is found immersed deeper into DPC micelles, probably due to the larger zwitterionic phosphocholine groups compared to the thinner layer of anionic sulphate groups in SDS. Due to the deeper immersion in DPC micelles there is less space available for the \u03b1-helix. This might be the reason for the helix being slightly bent in DPC solution. The positioning of maximin H6 closer to the surface in SDS micelles is also in agreement with its upfield shift of the amide proton of Leu2. The ionic interaction of the positively charged N-terminal NH3+-group (together with the charge of Lys-18) with the negative charge on the outside of the SDS micelles positions the peptide closer to the surface.",

            "text": "Further useful information that can be obtained from PREs in a paramagnetic environment of peptides bound to micelles pertains to their flexibility. Residues near the termini show unusually large PREs (see Supplementary data). This can be explained by the 1/r\n6 averaging of PREs towards smaller nucleus\u2013paramagnetic center distances \u201cr\u201d (Madl et al., 2009). If a specific nucleus spends only a short time close to a paramagnetic center it shows large PREs. In contrast, NOEs that are averaged to small inter-proton distances result in more compact structures. Therefore, differences between the NOE-derived structure of a micelle-bound peptide and PREs in a paramagnetic environment indicate different flexibility. This is confirmed by comparison with our 15N relaxation data. While the PRE data are represented quite well by the paramagnetic relaxation wave in the \u03b1-helical regions, the flexible terminal residues (in particular near the N-terminus) have very high PREs, which cannot be explained by a single NMR conformation. This reduced flexibility in DPC probably results from maximin H6 being immersed deeper into DPC compared to SDS micelles. That might enable the peptide to more readily rotate the GxxxG motif for finding other peptide binding partners in SDS micelles. The dimensions of the peptide\u2013micelle assemblies, as determined by self-diffusion experiments, do not indicate dimerization or formation of larger aggregates. In addition, we did not find any NOEs that do not fit a monomeric structure. Therefore, we have no indication for peptide\u2013peptide interactions in the micelles. However, their behaviour might be different in bacterial or erythrocyte membranes, which exhibit a lower lateral packing density and a more relaxed surface curvature.",

The three-dimensional structures formed in the two in membrane-mimetics are similar. However, in the SDS micelles, the peptide is more flexible and bound closer to the surface, and is rotated by around 70\u00b0 relative to the neutral DPC micelles, thereby orienting a GxxxG further inside the SDS micelle. The location closer to the surface in SDS is likely provided by the interaction of the negatively charged surface with the positive charges of the peptide. Together with a more favourable interaction of the GxxxG motif, this might form the basis for peptide\u2013peptide interactions leading finally to membrane disruption of microbial cell walls by cationic antimicrobial peptides.",
