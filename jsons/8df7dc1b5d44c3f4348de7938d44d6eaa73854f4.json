            "text": "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future. was reported in Iran and other countries, and transmission rate, mortality rate and the clinical manifestation slowly emerged. 5 In Iran on 19 March 2020, a total of 18 407 confirmed cases were reported with an apparent fatality rate of 6.98% ( Figure 1 ). As a result, approximately 0.02% of the Iranian population is affected by coronavirus disease. This index is currently at about 0.01% for China and less than 0.01% for Japan. However, Iran is less affected than Spain and Italy, according to official data from the WHO. and ORF1b (open reading frames) is used for direct production of two polypeptides: polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab), which encodes nonstructural proteins (nsps). 6 ORFs on the one-third of the genome near the 3'terminus encode at least four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins 6, 7 (Figure 2A ). The phylogenetic tree shows that the virus undergoes immunologic pressure and can increase the frequency of mutations in the genetic sequence of coronavirus among people from different countries. This process can increase viral virulence and transmissibility 8 ( Figure 2B ).",

It is possible that other receptors may exist, or another cellular entry mode is utilized such as antibody-dependent enhancement. 13 Many studies related to COVID-19 suggest a protective role of both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in humans. 14, 15 The S protein and the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were the most immunogenic and abundantly expressed proteins during infection. 15 In a study in China, most patients developed lymphopenia and pneumonia with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass opacity changes on a chest CT scan that was gold standard in diagnostic. Other changes that were usually observed in patients of this study included: lymphopenia 1100 \u03bc/L (45%), increased serum IL-6 (58%), and increased C-reactive protein (99%) were detected. Neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia also correlated with disease severity and mortality. 2, 19 To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus, promote the production of type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), which are important for antiviral innate immune responses and able to suppress viral replication and dissemination at an early stage. 22, 23 This process can cause complications such as exhaustion, weakness, and cough in patients. 24 The important point is, for SARS-CoV-2, the response to viral infection by type I IFN is suppressed (Figure 3 ).",

A, The genome structure of the new coronavirus. B, The phylogenetic tree of representatives from different countries killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. 33 The results of a study with 128 cases showed that the number and function of CD8 + T cells were greater than CD4 + T cell responses, 14, 34 although whether the memory T-cell response is sufficient to protect from reinfection needs further study. [34] [35] [36] Furthermore, the virus-specific T cells from the severe infection tended to have a central memory phenotype with a significantly higher frequency of polyfunctional CD4 + T cells with cytokine secretion, for example, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-2, and CD8 + T cells with cytokine secretion, for example, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and degranulated state, as com- should be 88%-90%. Invasive mechanical ventilation is used as a last resort. 44 The results of a recent study with 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is more effective than control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course. 45 In addition, teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the first stage of MERS-coronavirus viral cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved on the SARS-CoV-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus. 46 Recently, tocilizumab, also known as atlizumab, prescribed for two patients with COVID-19 infection in Iran and has shown promising results. This drug is an immunosuppressive humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and mainly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and IL-6 is a cytokine that plays an important role in immune response. 18, 47 More studies F I G U R E 3 Host immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 leads to infection of ACE2 expressing target cells such as alveolar type 2 cells or other unknown target cells. Cells infected by the virus may escape IFN I resulting in uncontrolled viral replication. The recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages is by chemotaxis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The \"CRS\" production-specific Th1/Th17 may cause immunopathologic injury in the lung that leads to pneumonia. B cells or plasma cells produce SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies that may help neutralize viruses. 25 Lymphopenia caused by viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 can occur with three mechanisms: The first mechanism is the reduction of lymphocyte production or impaired lymphopoiesis. The second mechanism is apoptosis and destruction of lymphocytes. The third mechanism that reduces lymphopenia without decreasing production or increasing degradation is lymphocyte redistribution, such as lymphocyte attachment to the vascular endothelium (a phenomenon similar to neutrophil marginalization) that can lead to decrease in circulating lymphocytes with controls and large sample size are needed to evaluate the effect of this drug on the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms.",

On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the latest virus as SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). 2,3 In late 2019, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, a large city in China 4 and then in February 2020, COVID-19",

For RNA virus such as coronavirus, it is known that PAMPs found in replicating viruses in the form of viral genomic ssRNA or double-stranded RNA that are recognized by either the endosomal RNA receptors, TLR8, and TLR7 in ssRNA and the cytosolic RNA sensor, RIG (retinoid-inducible gene)/ MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5). 14,20,21 This recognition event leads to activation of several signaling pathways and ultimately transcription factors, that is, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7 accompanied by their nuclear translocation. NF-\u03baB and AP-1 stimulate the expression of genes encoding many of the molecules required for inflammatory responses, including inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and IL-1) and chemokines (eg, CCL2 and CXCL8).

Recombinant IFN with ribavirin only has limited effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 43 Glucocorticoids are not a routine treatment. In emergency cases, such as SpO2 < 90%, dexamethasone 5-10 mg or methylprednisolone 40-80 mg is given intravenously before transfer.
