Nasopharyngeal swab samples of neonate and mother were collected, and the amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breast milk samples for the presence of COVID\u201019 were also tested, the aim is to provide an assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID\u201019 infection. Although the study analyzed only nine cases pregnant women with confirmed COVID\u201019 pneumonia, and the presence of replicable viruses in the blood of pregnant women was not confirmed, under the emergent circumstances and the limitation of detection methods, these findings are helpful for preventive and clinical practice in China and the world. The article concluded that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID\u201019 pneumonia in late pregnancy, and the clinical characteristics of pregnant women are basically the same as that of ordinary adults. While this conclusion may not be convincing because of the small number of cases, in addition, gestational age at the time of infection and the mode of delivery may affect the prognosis. All the nine cases of pregnancy included in this study were in the third trimester of pregnancy, gestational ages on admission were over 36 weeks and C\u2010sections were adopted, the results in fact revealed the necessity and effectiveness about taking reasonable measures in the early stage of COVID\u201019 infection, even in pregnancy. More data and experience is still needed to be collected for confirming the transmission and clinical characteristics of pregnancy.",

            "text": "Although limited studies suggested that COVID\u201019 infection has no specific effect on late pregnancy, however, the first or second\u2010trimester pregnancy deserves more attention. At different stages of pregnancy, the hormone level and immune status of pregnant women are totally different, which is bound to be closely related to the outcome of infection. In the early pregnancy, the normal immune balance of the mother is challenged by foreign fetal antigens,\n3\n which may appear unstable state. This state will tend to be stable with the gradual adaptation of the mother. With the growth of the fetus, the mother's immune system is constantly adjusting this steadily, so that it can finally reach a good balance in the late pregnancy. Therefore, the maternal immune system in early pregnancy is actually very sensitive, and the fetus is also in an important stage of organ development. External stimulation, especially virus infections (such as rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), may cause serious immune system disorder and internal environment imbalance, which probably lead to disease, abortion for mother or abnormal growth and development for fetus.\n4\n Previous studies have confirmed that the pandemic of viral infection, like H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection\n5\n or SARS 2003,\n6\n was related to the high incidence of maternal and infant complications, such as spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, tracheal intubation, admission to intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is time to predict that these consequences may have happened during the outbreak or may not have been discovered long after the outbreak. It is very necessary to investigate COVID\u201019 infection in the first and second trimester of pregnancy and keep follow\u2010up, these procedures/testing should be started from now and continued till the end of the epidemic for at least 1 year, or even longer. National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on 8 February 2020 about strengthening maternal disease treatment and safe midwifery during the prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia.\n7\n However, there is no recommendation for routine detection and monitoring of early and midterm pregnancy. Given the widespread and a large number of asymptomatic patients with COVID\u201019 infection, such follow ups may need to be further strengthened.",

In the current severe epidemic situation, many \u201cexpectant mothers\u201d in my colleagues still stick to work in their positions, some of them even work in fever clinics and isolation wards, they deserve to be taken care of and supported by policies.
