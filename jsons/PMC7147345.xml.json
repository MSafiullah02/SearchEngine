            "text": "Since the first reports on the inhibitory effect of type I IFN on HIV replication, the obvious suggestion was made that such molecules could be used as therapeutic agents to control the infection [23]. Obstruction of HIV replication by type I IFN appears to occur at different stages of the viral cycle, with effects which may be specific for certain cell types [24]. Thus, the general antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of type I IFN are only partially responsible for their anti-HIV activity. Of particular interest is the fact that monocytes/macrophages respond to type I IFN by upregulating and activating the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), an intracellular enzyme that exerts potent antiretroviral activity [25]. APOBEC3G blocks HIV replication prior to integration of the proviral DNA into the target cell\u2019s genome [26], but its induction by type I IFN is not observed in CD4 T-cell lines [27]. The cell-specific induction pattern of APOBEC3G may partially explain why type I IFN primarily inhibits the assembly and release of HIV in chronically-infected CD4 T cells [24,28], whilst reducing the relative levels of viral RNA and integrated provirus in macrophages [24,29,30]. Recent evidence also suggest that type I IFN may exert anti-HIV activity through inducing tetherin, a molecule which impedes virus release from the cell surface and is antagonized by the HIV accessory protein Vpu [31,32]. The anti-HIV activity of type I IFN has also been confirmed in vivo in the artificial system of SCID mice transplanted with human cell lines or primary leukocytes [33].",

The interaction of HIV with CD4 expressed on pDC is required to allow its endocytosis and subsequent presentation of the viral nucleic acid to endosmal TLR-7 and -9, essential for pDC activation [35]. The peculiar ability of HIV to interact with CD4, combined with the rapid endocytosis of CD4 by pDC, lead to the suggestion that HIV may provide a particularly strong and protracted trigger for pDC [22]. Recognition of HIV RNA by TLR-7 is probably the main route of HIV-induced pDC activation [35,36], but a role for TLR-9 cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "pDC from HIV-infected patients are refractory to in vitro re-stimulation with TLR-7 and -9 ligands or with HIV itself, and the frequency of circulating pDC is reduced in peripheral blood during HIV infection [34]. The dynamics of circulating pDC have been described to follow the changes observed in CD4 count during HIV infection. Thus, circulating pDC decrease during primary HIV infection, and this reduction is partially prevented by early HAART [37]. Efficient HAART treatment also recovers the levels of circulating pDC and their responsiveness to TLR stimulation in chronically HIV-infected patients, but not in patients in whom the CD4 count restoration is impaired [38]. Although these observations suggest an impairment of pDC functionality and type I IFN responses during HIV infection, a number of recent reports outlined how the reduction and apparent hyporesponsiveness of circulating pDC are both consequences of chronic HIV-induced hyperactivation. Plasma levels of type I IFN were described to increase rapidly in macaques upon simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection [39,40]. Abel and colleagues observed that the induction of type I IFN responses occurred early during acute infection and persisted throughout the course of disease [39]. Expression of type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes was observed in different lymphoid tissues, and associated with high tissue SIV RNA rather than control of viral replication [39]. The chronic triggering of pDC may lead to their relocation to lymphoid tissues and to the induction of an apparent refractory status induced through negative feedback [41,42]. These findings reconcile with earlier observations that the levels of type I IFN and type I IFN-regulated genes, including those associated with apoptotic pathways, are increased in peripheral leukocytes and lymphoid tissues from HIV-infected patients [43\u201345]. Therefore, during HIV infection, pDC may be chronically activated rather than hypofunctional, and production of type I IFN chronically induced rather than inhibited. The hypothesis that chronic pDC activation and type I IFN production may play a pivotal role in driving the immune dysfunction observed during HIV infection has brought alternative therapeutic methods to the attention of scientists and clinicians. The possibility that approaches aimed at blocking type I IFN or their signaling pathways may provide an immunologic benefit during HIV infection is supported by animal models showing that the prolonged stimulation of pDC causes dysfunctions similar to those observed in HIV-infected patients [46,47]. The expression of markers of chronic T-cell activation, considered a hallmark of HIV disease progression, may be at least, in part, dependent on HIV-induced type I IFN [48,49], and pDC from SIV natural hosts, which do not develop immunodeficiency and do not show signs of chronic immune activation, produce far less IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to TLR-7 and -9 stimulation compared with human or macaque pDC [50]. Furthermore, recent evidence from a nonhuman primate study shows that early accumulation of pDC at the initial site of infection in the vaginal mucosa drives the affluence of CCR5+ CD4 T cells, which are targets for SIV infection at this site, ultimately favoring the systemic diffusion of the virus [51].",

Mobilization of microbial components from the disrupted gut mucosa may also contribute to activate the innate immune system, as suggested by the direct correlation observed between plasma levels of lipopolysaccaride and IFN-\u03b1 in HIV-infected patients [55].

It is likely that, in vivo, type I IFN have both antiviral and pathogenic consequences at the same time; the key question that still needs to be answered is whether one effect prevails over the other or whether their relative contribution changes in different stages of the disease, and therefore which therapeutic approach is preferable.

Most clinical trials have focused on co-infection with HIV and other viral opportunistic pathogens such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma virus, HCV and HBV. A beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b1 was immediately recognized in the treatment of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in HIV patients in whom the number of circulating CD4 T cells was at least partially preserved [60]. By the early 1990s several independent studies indicated IFN-\u03b1 as an efficient anti-tumor drug in HIV patients with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma who had CD4 counts higher than 200 cells/mm3 (reviewed in [61]). The anti-tumor effect was often associated with a reduction in the circulating levels of HIV p24 antigen (determination of plasma viral RNA by PCR was not yet available), suggesting a partial anti-HIV effect [61]. IFN-\u03b1 has also been successfully used in the treatment of viral hepatitis, associated or not with HIV infection, and pegylated IFN-\u03b1 is still an integral part of the treatment of choice for HBV and HCV (reviewed in [62,63]). Despite this early interest in type I IFN as a therapeutic approach against HIV infection, the fact that their efficacy was limited to immunocompetent patients together with the introduction of azidothymidine first and then HAART have reduced the enthusiasm and dampened the interest for this approach. Of the registered clinical trials on type I IFN therapy for the purpose of treating primarily HIV rather than other opportunistic infections, only four are still active and only two of these are still actively recruiting [202,203]. A recent study on chronically SIV-infected macaques showed that short-term treatment (daily dose for 14 weeks) with pegylated IFN-\u03b12a had no effect on plasma viremia, despite inducing transient increases in the expression of type I IFN-inducible genes [64]. Yet, recent studies on co-infection with GB virus C in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART have shown that the activation of genes associated with the type I IFN pathway correlated with the better prognosis normally observed in these patients [65,66]. These studies suggest that stimulation of the type I IFN system may be beneficial when HIV replication, the principal chronic stimulus for pDC activation, is efficiently suppressed by HAART. In addition, a recent study involving HCV/HIV-co-infected patients showed that administration of pegylated IFN shortly after HAART interruption delayed the rebound of HIV plasma viral load [67].",

However, as of today, only agonists of IFNAR, in the form of recombinant or natural IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are regularly used as therapeutic agents, even when conditions other than HIV infection are considered. The direct stimulation of pDC through TLR agonists, particularly targeting TLR-9 and -7, may provide an alternative to the use of recombinant or natural type I IFN. The potential for the use of TLR-7 and -9 agonists in different clinical indications has been recently reviewed elsewhere [68]. This review will focus specifically on their potential and their limitations as therapeutic agents in HIV infection. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are potent agonists of TLR-9 and induce type I IFN production both in vitro and in vivo\n[69]. The clinical applications for which CpG ODNs are currently being considered involve primarily their use as adjuvants in vaccination strategies, taking advantage of their ability to boost the innate immune response, which in turns favors the development of efficient vaccine-induced adaptive immunity [68]. TLR-7 agonists, such as imiquimod and resiquimod, are commonly used in topically applied cream formulations for the treatment of skin conditions such as virus-induced genital warts [70,71]. However, preparations of both imiquimod and resiquimod for oral administration have been developed and have undergone clinical trials for chronic infections [72].",

            "text": "In the case of HIV infection, CpG ODNs could be considered not only as adjuvants in vaccine-based therapy or prophylaxis, but also as therapeutic agents taking advantage of the antiviral activity of type I IFN. In vivo, CpG ODNs were shown to improve vaccine-induced memory T-cell responses, and their application as adjuvants to improve vaccine-induced T-cell responses represents one of their main prospective clinical applications in the setting of HIV infection [73]. Although of interest, these applications inevitably rely on the delivery of an efficient vaccine, which is still not available for HIV. Whether suboptimal vaccine strategies that have already been investigated can be significantly improved by optimizing the adjuvant with which they are paired remains to be determined. A therapeutic approach can be considered based on the potential type I IFN-mediated anti-HIV activity of CpG ODN, as demonstrated for thymic pDC in vitro\n[74]. CpG ODN were also shown to improve the anti-HIV activity of other effector cells of the innate arm of the immune response. For example, the lysis of infected CD4 T cells by natural killer cells is dependent on type I IFN production by pDC, and is therefore positively affected by CpG ODNs in vitro\n[75]. A similar application has been proposed for the TLR-7 agonist imiquimod, which was tested in a Phase I study for administration to asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, but did not result in a consistent reduction in viral load, despite increasing circulating levels of type I IFN in all treated patients [76]. The question can be raised as to which advantages and disadvantages the administration of TLR-7 and -9 agonists may have compared with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Although the proposed therapeutic ability of molecules that stimulate pDC depends largely on the induction of type I IFN production, this approach may have a broader biological effect than the simple use of recombinant or natural IFN-\u03b1. Thus, by stimulating pDC, TLR-7 and -9 agonists may promote not only the production of type I IFN, but also the maturation of pDC into effector cells with cytotoxic, antigen presenting and migratory ability [36]. In particular, the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 on activated pDC may contribute to their migration to lymph nodes [77], which are important reservoirs for HIV [78]. Although many of the phenotypic and functional changes induced by TLR-7 and -9 agonists in pDC depend themselves on type I IFN signaling, direct stimulation of pDC via TLR-7 or -9 may still provide an anatomic advantage over the simple administration of IFN-\u03b1, in that activated pDC will produce antiviral type I IFN directly in the sites where HIV is actively replicating, whereas the dynamics with which IFN-\u03b1 distributes in lymphoid tissue is hard to predict. On the other hand, chronic HIV infection results in progressive impairment of pDC responsiveness to TLR-7 and -9 stimulation [41], which may undermine the potential efficacy of treatments which target these receptors. This hyporesponsiveness is in part caused by viral proteins, such as gp120-mediated inhibition of TLR-9 activation [79], and in part by the fact that HIV itself is a powerful and persistent stimulus for pDC, causing them to be refractory to further stimulation due to type I IFN-mediated negative feedback [41]. This last observation constitutes a strong criticism to the use of TLR-7 and -9 agonists or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as antiviral treatments of HIV infection: if HIV itself is a stimulus powerful enough to dampen the responsiveness of pDC to external stimulation, why is this not sufficient to exert antiviral effect? Also, in such an overstimulated environment, is it really beneficial to deliver additional pressure to the immune system? The potential risk of pDC overstimulation are epitomized by studies performed on murine models, in which repeated administration of TLR-7 or -9 agonists resulted in severe impairment of immune function [46,47].",

This difference correlates with the absence of AIDS in SIV natural hosts [50], suggesting that in disease-susceptible hosts the chronic activation of pDC and subsequent type I IFN production may play a major role in the exhaustion of the immune system [22]. Concomitantly, the role of type I IFN in raising and sustaining both T-cell and B-cell responses [84\u201387] may directly favor the chronic hyperactivation of adaptive immune responses, repeatedly reported as a main contributor to HIV pathogenesis [81,88\u201390]. Moreover, a topical anti-inflammatory agent, which prevented pDC accumulation in the vaginal mucosa, protected rhesus macaques from SIV infection through the vaginal route [51], underscoring the important role that pDC have in also favoring the recruitment of activated T cells at the site of infection, thus fueling the initial burst of viral replication [51].",

HIV-infected patients were immunized against IFN-\u03b12b in order to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies which would prevent type I IFN signaling. The immunization was efficacious in the Phase I/II studies, and immunized patients showed better preservation of CD4 count and delayed clinical deterioration [93]. In the Phase II/III study that followed, a suboptimal immunization protocol (three oil-adjuvanted injections were used in the Phase II/III trial, compared with six or seven in the Phase I/II study) was used, and production of neutralizing antibodies was induced only in one-third of the enrolled patients [94]. However, patients who responded to immunization with an increase in anti-IFN-\u03b1 antibodies showed a lower rate of disease progression [94]. Owing to the introduction of protease inhibitors in HIV therapy during the period of the trial, more than 60% of the patients enrolled were elected to add these drugs to their regimen, and experienced the marked improvements in clinical progression normally observed with HAART [94]. This change in therapy made it impossible to achieve the expected end points of the study, prompting to halt further follow-up studies [94]. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that interventions aimed at interfering with type I IFN signaling may prove beneficial in the treatment of HIV disease.",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine diffuse through the cell membrane and raise the pH of endocytotic vescicles [97]. Besides being necessary for the life cycle of Plasmodium(hence the antimalaric activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), the acidic pH is also required for processing engulfed pathogen and presenting their antigens [98], as well as exposing nucleic acids to TLR-7 and -9 in pDC [99]. The activation of pDC by HIV, and its consequences on the phenotype and function of T cells, are also sensitive to inhibition by chloroquine [35,36,48\u201350]. Because it is already approved for use in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune disorders such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, chloroquine is probably the drug with the most immediate potential for application to HIV treatment. A Phase II/III trial [209] is already recruiting for testing the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine in HIV-infected patients. Chloroquine presents the additional advantage of having demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HIV replication in vitro\n[100]. Thus, chloroquine may have a beneficial effect on HIV disease by two separate routes: an effect on HIV replication with consequent reduction of the chronic immune-activating viral stimulus, and a direct effect on pDC activation, reducing their responsiveness to HIV and therefore limiting chronic immune activation. Besides the same downsides noted above for other immunoregulatory agents such as TLR-7 and -9 antagonists and anti-IFN-\u03b1 antibodies, the prospect of long-term administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine must take into consideration the well known adverse effects reported for these drugs, some of which are potentially serious such as severe damage to vision, which can occur with chronic use [101].",

            "text": "Production of type I IFN by pDC is part of the normal early innate immune response against viral infections [17,102]. However, during HIV infection, pDC stimulation continues throughout the course of the disease [22,39]. Furthermore, HIV possesses a characteristic feature that distinguishes it from most viruses, in that it engages the target cells via CD4. Blockade of gp120\u2013CD4 interactions inhibits the induction of type I IFN and other pDC-mediated immunoregulatory mechanisms in vitro\n[35,36,103,104]. This interaction can be antagonized in at least two different ways: by using antibodies directed against the HIV envelope protein gp120; or by using a recombinant soluble form of human CD4 (sCD4-Ig) [104]. Both these molecules were tested in the early 1990s for their potential as anti-HIV drugs (Table 1), with particular interest toward sCD4-Ig [105]. However, the limited effect on viral replication (measured as p24 antigen, as HIV RNA measurement by PCR was not yet available) and the almost complete lack of effect on CD4 count [105], rapidly dissipated the enthusiasm over the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Furthermore, the availability of more efficient antiretroviral drugs during the period in which sCD4-Ig was tested, shifted the interest of scientists and clinicians toward more efficient approaches. Nevertheless, extensive studies on the potential of sCD4-Ig as a modulator of the immunologic effects of HIV, rather than viral replication, have never been performed. Thus, such an approach may not have a strong impact on the plasma virus levels, but may prevent or counteract the chronic activation of type I IFN, with important positive consequences on other markers of disease progression, such as T-cell activation and immune function.",

Thus, despite being very efficient in inhibiting pDC activation by HIV, there is no reason to believe that sCD4-Ig may affect the ability of pDC to recognize and produce type I IFN in response to other viruses, leaving the capacity of these cells to initiate an early innate immune response against other opportunistic infections intact. In light of these observations, an approach aimed at specifically blocking the initial interaction of HIV with pDC, using sCD4-Ig or other similar molecules, may be the best therapeutic option to interfere with the type I IFN system. Furthermore, directly inhibiting HIV-mediated pDC activation may affect other pathogenic mechanisms that are not strictly dependent on type I IFN signaling, but require pDC activity. Thus, the expression of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is induced in pDC upon exposure to HIV [48,103], and activation of this mechanism may in turn drive the differentiation of regulatory T cells [106], potentially contributing to the generalized impairment of T-cell responses [107,108].",

However, the advances made in understanding HIV pathogenesis have forced a re-evaluation of the role that type I IFN may have in this disease, underscoring how their chronic production may have deleterious effects on the immune system. This alternative view nourished the interest for therapeutic agents that inhibit type I IFN production or signaling, with the goal of limiting the immunologic damage that they may cause during HIV infection. It is likely that a balance exists between the beneficial antiviral effect and the deleterious consequences of type I IFN, and that the same balance extends to all prospective treatments that affect the pDC/type I IFN system.",

Encouraging results from the ongoing trials in which chloroquine is being tested for HIV infection may open the door not only for testing compounds which are already available, but also for seeking the development of novel therapeutic agents which target the same pathway, for example by inhibiting key molecular components of the TLR-7 and -9 or IFNAR signal transduction pathways.",
