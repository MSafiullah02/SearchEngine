Furthermore, the volume and complexity of knowledge and information are such that unless a reporting structure is overlaid upon it, it may remain meaningless. Knowledge visualisation uses graphical representations to convey organisational knowledge, enabling employees to share and recall relevant knowledge. However, in order to assist organisations to create and transfer knowledge more effectively through knowledge visualisation, the aim of this study is to provide a conceptual knowledge visualisation framework for the transfer of knowledge for organisations. A conceptual knowledge visualisation framework was designed through a systematic literature review process where 15 organisational knowledge visualisation elements were identified. The 15 elements were grouped and presented in a 4-layered, embedded conceptual framework that organisations may apply to their knowledge visualisation efforts. By using such a framework, organisations may optimise learning and improve knowledge and skills of its employees.",

With the evolution of digital technologies, many opportunities are realised through the application of the digital technologies [2, 3] . Some of these include cyber-physical systems where control and monitoring are done by computer-based algorithms e.g. autonomous vehicles, the internet of things creating a connected world e.g. enabling smart cities, cloud computing providing ondemand availability of data storage and computing power and cognitive computing e.g. artificial intelligence [4, 5] . The ability of organisations to apply and optimise Industry 4.0 technologies require digital citizens to have the knowledge and skills to effectively use and apply these digital technologies [6] . Both from a commercial perspective, as well as a knowledge and skill outlook, digital technologies enable two options: firstly, they provide multiple options for an organisation to embrace digital transformation and secondly, they enable a world of visual and experiential learning in order to enhance skills and knowledge [6, 7] .",

Knowledge visualisation on the other hand is not as mature [12, 13] and therefore, lacks a generic set of guidelines [10, 14] . An interconnected field and predecessor of knowledge visualisation is information visualisation and both these fields are utilising our natural abilities to successfully process visual representations. Although both these fields make use of our natural visual abilities, the way of utilising these abilities differ in both fields: Information visualisation intends to examine a large amount of abstract data to obtain new perceptions or to make the data more approachable. Knowledge visualisation, on the other hand, intends to enhance the transfer and creation of knowledge amongst people by providing a richer approach to communicate what they know. While information visualisation assists in improving the retrieval, access and presentation of information from large data sets, knowledge visualisation is mainly concerned with increasing knowledge-intensive communication amongst people [15] .",

Such means should be flexible enough to accommodate changing insights, and facilitate conversations. Such representations facilitate and expedite the creation and transfer of knowledge between people by improving and promoting knowledge processing and comprehension\" [10: 3] .

Information is data with relevance and purpose added, while knowledge comes with insights, framed experiences, intuition, judgement and values and encompasses the scope of understanding and skills that are created by people through cognitive processes [20] . Knowledge can be categorised as either being explicit (has been articulated) or implicit (less tangible, deeply embedded knowledge) [21] . Tacit knowledge, as a dimension of implicit knowledge, is personal and contextspecific, and therefore hard to communicate and formalise [21] . In order to act on information, a person should internalise the information and achieve this by progressing through knowledge conversion processes namely socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation [21] . Socialisation ensures that knowledge is acquired, after which externalisation enables students to express their tacit knowledge (mental models and know-how). Combination is the process of integrating concepts, while internalisation is closely related to learning-by-doing, or experiential learning [21] . This process of knowledge application ensures that knowledge is advanced through practice, guidance, imitation and observation [19] .",

The research studies were screened by applying specific criteria to exclude papers such as studies not associated with the research questions, non-English studies, and opinion-based papers. Duplicate studies retrieved were also removed. During the second stage of the SLR, conducting the review, the selected papers were analysed in detail.

Two elements specifically pointed to the target audience of the knowledge visualisation namely, need and engagement. Audience need indicates key considerations relevant to the target audience such as an individual or a team, while audience engagement points to the audienceknowledge visualisation interaction with specific reference to how the knowledge visualisation enhance and facilitate learning engagement through interaction and experience. The focus of graphical excellence is on usability of the visualisation and ensuring that irrelevant items or decoration do not distract the target audience from the content of the topic. Essence refers to the identification and utilisation of the essentials, as well as their relationships, from a body of knowledge identified for visualisation, while accessibility indicates the relationship the target audience holds with the knowledge subject area, namely ensure that the level of abstraction is aligned to the target audience's prior knowledge of the particular knowledge subject area. The minimisation of the number of concepts in each level of knowledge visualisation points to the simplicity element, and intelligibility focuses on the objective that the knowledge visualisation should not carry ambiguity and that it is easy to understand. Uniformity of visual elements such as colour, symbols, shapes, etc. should be the same for the same kinds of information. Context is about presenting both the detail required for the knowledge visualisation, as well as the overview of where the detailed portion fits in. Context in an organisation highlights the combination of internal and external factors relevant to the organisation that may impact its products, services, business models, operating model, etc. Cohesion is the principle of working together and in the context of knowledge visualisation, it implies that the relationship among knowledge concepts, must be shown clearly. The explanatory power element ensures that knowledge visualisation has both explanatory and descriptive value. Descriptive value gives details and describes the knowledge that the target audience needs to understand, while explanatory value gives the reasons for it. In the organisational context, its application is closely related to whether knowledge recall is required, whether new insights are shared or whether existing knowledge is elaborated upon. By associating knowledge visualisation with familiar real world images, the target audience is enabled to recognise and interpret visuals rather than to have to remember and recall meaning. The legend element provides the information needed for the knowledge visualisation to make sense and assists in explaining meaning and interpretation. The process of transferring knowledge from one part of the organisation to another by organising, creating, capturing or distributing knowledge and ensuring it is available for future users, depicts the knowledge transfer cognitive process elements. The last element, visual integrity, points to the principle that the knowledge visualisation should have uncompromising adherence to underlying knowledge and should not create a false impression or interpretation of that knowledge.",

By applying the conceptual framework analysis [45] and considering the unique features and constructs of the elements defined in Table 1 , we identified 4 impact levels in the organisation as depicted in Table 2 : target audience, design elements, design principles and organisational purpose.",

Design principles depicts the key considerations when designing the knowledge visualisation aligned to the purpose, and aims to establish a good design that is simple to understand, cohesive and explanatory in nature. Employees must be able to easily associate the knowledge visualisation with the organisational purpose and the objective of what needs to be achieved with the knowledge transfer.

Elements impacting the employees in the organisation includes the need of different employees e.g. individuals, functional teams, project teams, etc. Knowledge visualisation must address the need from the particular employee or employee group it is intended for. Related to audience need, is audience engagement as the interaction with the visualised knowledge should enhance and facilitate learning engagement or the employee or employee group. Context and accessibility are also elements that impact the employees engaging with the knowledge visualisation as organisational boundaries and the particular scenario that must be visualised, is a key consideration. Accessibility is a key enabler as this element needs to ensure that an employee can place the knowledge visualisation subject area in context and interpret it within the organisational context. However, the 4 impact levels of the 15 knowledge visualisation elements identified is not standalone and are interrelated. By bearing Table 2 in mind and considering the interrelated nature of the impact levels, an embedded and layered knowledge visualisation framework for organisations may be defined and is depicted in Fig. 1 . Figure 1 illustrates 4 layers with organisational purpose as the inner most layer, followed by design principles, design elements and ultimately target audience. For each layer, the particular elements relevant to that layer are shown. Organisational purpose at the core, impacts greatly on the focus of the knowledge visualisation and each layer contribute further to guide or clarify what is required for the organisation.",
