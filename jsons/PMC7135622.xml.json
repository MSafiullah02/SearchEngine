This permits the accumulation of pathogens and a progressive recharge of the faecal-oral cycle (Coop and Wrigth, 2000). The poor hygiene, together with the accumulation of lambs in the pens (more than 2 lambs/m2), contributes to the contamination of the area and the spreading of the disease (Radostits et al., 1999, Causape et al., 2002).",

A positive relationship was recorded between milk composition and the presence of diarrhoea (Table 1). When large quantities of very rich milk are ingested, the digestive ability of the abomasum is exceeded, and milk clotting is impaired. Partially digested milk proceeds along the small bowel, resulting in high concentration of nutrients, specially lactose, in the gut lumen, withdrawing water from interstitial space and favouring the onset of diarrhoea (Radostits et al., 1999). In addition, due to the climatic conditions of the area, sheep receive more supplements during the lambing period of autumn-winter and they presumably produce richer milk in this season (Izquierdo et al., 2003).",

This low value suggested that the poor immune status observed in the lambs of the experiment might be linked to the low immune levels of their dams and not to FPT. This was confirmed by the positive correlation between the individual levels of gamma globulin in ewes and their lambs. This fact explained that below 1.3 g/dL more farms showed high mortality (Table 1).

This variable had a significant relationship with the number of high and low mortality farms (Table 1) and its origin lies in the positive correlation detected between serum gamma globulin in lambs and serum total protein in ewes. Consequently, the measure of serum total protein in ewes before lambing would be a valuable indicator of the risk of lamb scouring and it would be useful to establish an adequate programme to prevent this condition in the farms of this geographical area.",
