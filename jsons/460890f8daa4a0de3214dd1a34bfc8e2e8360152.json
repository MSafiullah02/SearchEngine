Respirology 2004; 9 : 173-183 Objective: There is so far no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for the coronavirusassociated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We aimed to analyse the outcomes of a standard treatment strategy comprising antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin, a 3-week step-down course of corticosteroids, and the possibility of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue in the event of deterioration. Methodology: This was a prospective cohort study performed at a major public-funded hospital in Hong Kong. Eighty-eight World Health Organisation/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probable cases of SARS (97% laboratory-confirmed) were treated with a standard protocol previously reported. Seventy-one patients treated de novo were analysed in detail with regard to time to clinical stabilization after combination treatment, requirement of additional therapy (pulsed methylprednisolone; assisted ventilation); and final outcomes (recovery, mortality). Results: The mean age was 42. Twenty-one patients (24%) had comorbidities. Three of 71 treated de novo recovered with antibiotics alone. The remaining 68 received combination treatment at a mean of 5.8 days after symptom onset, of whom 30 subsequently required pulsed methylprednisolone rescue (independent predictors: older age and higher LDH) and 18 required assisted ventilation (independent predictors: older age, higher oxygen requirement and creatinine level). Their median time to clinical stabilization was 8.0 days after combination treatment (independent predictor for longer time to stabilization: median age of 41 or above). Common complications were hyperglycaemia (58%), pneumo-mediastinum/thoraces (13%), psychiatric manifestations (7%) and ventilatorassociated pneumonia (2%). One patient (1%) died of SARS-related respiratory failure. All-cause mortality was 3.4%, occurring in patients aged > 65 years only. None of the discharged survivors required continuation of oxygen therapy. Conclusions: This standard treatment protocol resulted in overall satisfactory outcomes.

In comparison, the type, route and dosages of drugs administered have not been uniform in other reported series.

The presenting demographic and clinical characteristics of our patients (Table 1) were similar to or worse than those reported by the larger series in the literature, 5-8 but only one patient received Pentaglobin as additional immunomodulatory agent. Other modalities of experimental treatment (e.g. lopinavir- ritonavir combination, 15 convalescent serum therapy, 16 thymosin-a 1 (SciClone Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Mateo, CA, USA), 17 pentoxyfylline, tumour necrosis factor blocking agents (etanercept (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Madison, NJ, USA) and infliximab), had not been required in other patients because of satisfactory response to the standard protocol. We did not find HbsAg carrier state to be an adverse factor, and lamivudine had not been used for prophylaxis of hepatitis B relapse. 6, 8 We venture to postulate therefore that the differences in outcome between ours and other reported series could possibly be related to differences in the details of treatment interventions given. Although ribavirin had been commonly used in the 2003 SARS outbreak, [5] [6] [7] 9 it is now widely believed that it has no benefits on outcome. 18, 19 We continued to use ribavirin because of the continuing recovery of our patients and because of theoretical benefits from its immunomodulatory activities. 20, 21 Where the drug was given at higher dosages, 7 major adverse effects had occurred without improvement in outcome. We therefore think that ribavirin per se is unlikely to be the reason for the satisfactory outcome in our patients. However, the effect of ribavirin in the present study could not be independently assessed because most patients had received both corticosteroid and ribavirin. The utility of corticosteroids in SARS has also been much debated. Activation of the immune system by acute bacterial or viral infection is known to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids can decrease the release of macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines, 22 and there are anecdotal reports suggesting benefits from high-dose corticosteroids in the management of other viral pneumonitis. [23] [24] [25] [26] Since the dose regimens employed were dissimilar between series, 1,4-9 we believe that differences in timing, dosage and duration of corticosteroid use may account for differences in outcome. 19 Our group commenced methylprednisolone at a mean of 5.8 \u00b1 3.0 days after symptom onset, when clinical criteria we had defined a priori as representing an excessive host response were fulfilled. The pathogenesis of SARS is proposed to comprise three stages, namely viral replication, lung inflammation and fibrosis. 6 Based on this assumption, we speculate that our treatment criteria had enabled our patients to be covered with an anti-inflammatory agent very soon after the onset of immune lung damage. In another series in which a similar combination was started based solely on lack of clinical response to antibiotics after 48 h without explicit radiological criteria, or even earlier if patients had epidemiological history of contact, 8 mortality was 7.9% which the authors stated was an underestimation because of sampling bias. The comparatively higher mortality could have reflected an earlier use of corticosteroid without considering clinical indicators of onset of pulmonary immunopathological damage. If this hypothesis is correct, such timing would possibly be still in the pure viral replicative phase in some of the patients, with the possible risk of further increasing the viral load without corresponding beneficial effect on immunopathological lung damage. While nasopharyngeal aspirate PCR status for SARS-CoV aspirate was a predictor of mortality in another series, 27 there was no relationship between this status and the time to stabilization in our patients. We therefore believe that appropriate timing of steroid commencement could be a more important factor predicting outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 778, "end": 780, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 846, "end": 848, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1248, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1250, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1518, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1522, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1526, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1528, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1594, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1597, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1756, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1759, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2443, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2573, "end": 2577, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2582, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2587, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2592, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2787, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3104, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4176, "end": 4178, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 494, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Experience derived from our protocol development suggests that starting corticosteroids at lower dosages Values are number (%) or mean \u00b1 SD unless stated otherwise. \u2020 Deaths: SARS (aged 74); acute myocardial infarction (aged 67); acute brainstem and cerebellar stroke (aged 72).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Radiological findings illustrating the clinical course of a 42-year-old-male patient (chronic smoker and drinker) responding to the treatment strategies in the protocol.

(c) Due to failure to respond to non-invasive ventilation, intubation and mechanical ventilation was eventually required and had been instituted for 6 days. No ventilator-associated pneumonia was documented. Subcutaneous emphysema can be seen in bilateral axillary tissues on the CXR. Despite the persistence of lung infiltrates, no further pulsed steroid was given because CXR began to improve after his initial course of pulsed steroid therapy. (d) CT thorax after extubation. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are seen. The lung infiltrates consisted mainly of thickened interstitium bilaterally suggestive of early scarring. The patient was prescribed tailing dosages of corticosteroid according to the protocol and continued to improve. (e) The patient began to be weaned off oxygen supplementation at 4 weeks after admission. The infiltrates appear to be different from those in the initial films, being consistent with resolution of lung scars after inflammation or infection. (f ) CXR about 8 weeks after symptom onset.
