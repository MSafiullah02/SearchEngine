Additionally, a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the proportion of children with diarrhea who consulted at a health structure. Model fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model; thus, where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology an ensemble approach can account for that uncertainty. We compare our results across several variants of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates. Model-specific parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We then use Bayesian model averaging to generate ensemble estimates of the current dynamics, including estimates of R0, the burden of infection in the region, as well as the impact of vaccination on both the short-term dynamics and the long-term reduction of rotavirus incidence under varying levels of coverage. The ensemble of models predicts that the current burden of severe rotavirus disease is 2.9 to 4.1% of the population each year and that a 2-dose vaccine schedule achieving 70% coverage could reduce burden by 37-43%.",

            "text": "Observation of rotavirus dynamics and estimation of the burden of rotavirus disease is limited both by non-specific surveillance and under-reporting. The dynamics of rotavirus transmission must often be inferred from non-specific temporal surveillance of diarrheal disease that includes multiple causes. This is analogous to the dynamics of specific influenza strains, which are commonly inferred from non-specific time series surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) that includes infection by multiple influenza strains (influenza A and B), as well as additional viral infections, for example parainfluenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus [35, 10] . In sub-Saharan Africa, the cause of diarrheal disease is often unknown due to a lack of diagnostic capacity [28] . Even when the cause of disease is known, an unknown fraction of cases will occur in the community and never be recorded by the health system, leading to a potentially significant level of under-reporting. Dynamic models in general, and so-called state-space models in particular, have been an important tool in the assessment of disease burden from non-specific or imperfect surveillance [19, 16, 7] . We estimate the burden of rotavirus in the Maradi region of Niger by synthesizing two sources of data. We use hospital surveillance data collected by Epicentre for the incident cases over time, including lab-confirmation to assess the likelilhood that a case of severe diarrhea is caused by rotavirus. In addition, we use a cluster survey of households conducted to estimate the proportion of diarrheal disease cases in the region seeking care. The latter is used to help estimate the reporting rate.",

Thus, the inference about disease burden is conditional on the structure of the underlying dynamic model. For pathogens with well characterized epidemiology, such as measles and influenza, the application of state-space models to infer disease burden and transmission dynamics has become common [19, 9, 7, 38] . The dynamics of rotavirus, which itself comprises multiple strains that result in varying levels of cross-protective immunity to other strains, has been variously described by a suite of different models [32] . Therefore, inference about rotavirus burden is limited both by imperfect surveillance of rotavirus infection and uncertainty about the underlying transmission dynamics. Rather than condition our analysis on any one model, we fit the observed time series to a suite of 5 different model structures and assumptions to account for uncertainty in model parameters as well as the dynamics represented in the models themselves.",

The predicted impact of vaccine introduction may depend both on the efficacy of the vaccine and model structure; for example [32] proposed alternative models for boosting of immunity following sequential exposure to rotavirus. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) [4, 18] allows for the integration of predictions of multiple models, weighted by their posterior support, to generate a single ensemble estimate that accounts for uncertainty in model selection. Here, via BMA, we use the ensemble of fitted models to predict the short-term and long-term impact of vaccination on rotavirus incidence. We then estimate the predicted impact using the vaccine efficacy from two different studies. Our ensemble approach predicts that the current burden of severe rotavirus disease is 2.9 to 4.1% of the population each year and that a 2-dose vaccine schedule achieving 70% coverage could reduce burden by 37-43%.",

The second dose confers additional protection comparable to that conferred by secondary infection. For Model A, where the risk of infection does not decrease based previous number of infections, a separate input parameter is used for the vaccine efficacy. The vaccine efficacy is set to be equal to the predicted efficacy for Models B-E (see supplementary material for details). We study the effect of the vaccine under varying levels of coverage. The short-term effect of vaccination is assessed by looking at incidence over a five year period following introduction of the vaccine. The long-term effect is measured by the yearly reduction in incident cases of Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) measured 20 years after introduction of the vaccine. Field efficacy of a multidose rotavirus vaccination strategy is uncertain. To reflect this uncertainty, we investigate the impact of vaccination using the value of efficacy from two different studies. First based on the results of [24] , for low income countries, we assume a seroconversion rate of 63%. Second, a recent study of a 3-dose vaccination strategy in Niger [20] estimated efficacy of 66.7% with all doses.

[20] reported a lower efficacy from a 3-dose schedule in Niger; this would lower the projected reduction of severe RVGE to 28-33%. Notably, although BMA estimates a total reduction in yearly cases using both the efficacy reported in [24] and [20] , it also predicts higher peaks where more cases are observed than pre-vaccination. This short-term difference in cycle amplitude for these models is a phenomenon anticipated by [33] . Anticipation of this shift in dynamic regime caused by vaccination may be critical to the interpretation of short-term surveillance as the observation of higher peak incidence following the introduction of vaccination may be wrongly interpreted as a failure in the vaccination program.",

Although we used the two dose strategy, by using different value of the efficacy, our study can account for uncertainty in the seroconversion rate. Figures 7-9 are matched to Figures 3-5 in the main paper. Because of the lower seroconversion rate, the projected results were qualitatively similar, quantitatively smaller. Vaccination causes a shift in the age distribution across models (Figure 7) , with a higher proportion of RVGE cases occurring for older children.

Newborns are added to this class at rate \u00b5 and individuals leave this class when maternal immunity wanes with rate \u03b4, where the mean period of maternal immunity is assumed to be 13 weeks (\u03b4 =1  13  ). When maternal immunity wanes children are susceptible to rotavirus infection. In(2), we see that individuals enter the susceptible class when maternal immunity wanes. They become infected at a rate given by the force of infection \u03bb i . After recovery, individuals may reenter the susceptible class at rate \u03c4 , where the mean period of immunity following infection is fixed at one year (\u03c4 = 1/52).Equation (3) models the change in total infections with severe rotavirus. We assume the proportion of infections with severe rotavirus is lower than mild by setting \u03bb s,i = 0.24\u03bb i . Individuals leave the infected with severe rotavirus for a mean period of one week (\u03b3 s = 1) following which they are considered to be recovered.

Therefore the vaccine efficacy for all RVGE isIn practice, first model parameters \u0398 are estimated via MCMC for the models without vaccination.Using the fitted model, the dynamics are then integrated forward at the posterior mean of \u0398 until the periodic solution has been reached. Then, the dynamics are modified to allow for transitions between compartments by vaccination.A.2.1 Projections Based on Vaccine Efficacy from a Recent StudyRecently[20] estimated that 3 doses of vaccine had 66.7% efficacy against severe RVGE among children in Niger. Though we do not explicitly account for 3 doses of vaccine, we can calculate the effective seroconversion rate for our model above that would yield this observed efficacy after a complete sequence of doses. Thus, we set \u03b7 s = .667 and use(5) to calculate the effective seroconversion rate as 49%. Then the vaccine efficacy for all RVGE is \u03b7 m = .515. We estimate the predicted impact of vaccination using different \u03b7 s , \u03b7 m and s values with the same dynamic equations.",
