            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a re\u2010emerging zoonotic flavivirus that is transmitted by mosquitos from birds and/or swine to humans. It contains a single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA (~11 kb, monopartite, linear) genome in a capsid. JEV poses an increasing threat to global health and welfare, with approximately 67, 900 cases reported annually.1, 2, 3 JEV is now spreading to previously unaffected regions, such as Indonesia, Pakistan and northern Australia, due to rapid changes in climate and demography.1, 2 Considerable progress in uncovering the pathogenesis of JE, acute neuroinflammation caused by JEV, has been made in infected patients and murine models.4, 5, 6 The incubation period of JE ranges from 5 to 15 days and the disease is fatal in 25 to 30% of cases, mostly in infants. A high proportion of surviving patients have serious neurological and psychiatric sequelae.3 Hence, JE may have higher mortality than the acute neuroinflammation caused by infection with West Nile virus (WNV), which results in 3\u20135% mortality (1, 100 deaths/29, 000 symptomatic infections).7 Although JEV is thought to infect and kill neurons directly in the central nervous system (CNS), CNS invasion by JEV induces activation of microglia/glia and infiltration of peripheral leucocytes. This leads to indirect neuronal killing via uncontrolled secretion of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines [such as interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) and tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1)] and soluble mediators that can induce neuronal death.8, 9 Therefore, adequate CNS infiltration and activation of peripheral immune cells play an important role in protecting hosts from JE progression without tissue injury.",

This can result in beneficial or detrimental outcomes, depending on the encephalitis context.11, 12, 13 For example, infection of CCR5\u2010deficient mice was uniformly fatal with drastically decreased infiltration of T cells and monocytes in the CNS following WNV infection.14 A similar increase in susceptibility was observed in a homozygous individual with a complete loss\u2010of\u2010function mutation, CCR5\u039432.15 Individual inhibition of CXCR3, CCR2 and CCR5 with corresponding antagonists also produced no changes in viral titre and survival following infection with virulent Semliki Forest virus, whereas simultaneous blockage of CXCR3 and CCR2 resulted in significantly reduced mortality in response to viral encephalitis caused by Semliki Forest virus, rather than an increase in mortality.16\n",

CCR2 is considered critical to CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocyte trafficking and is thought to be expressed on subsets of activated T cells, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells.17 The primary and specific ligand for CCR2 is CCL2, but this receptor can also bind to CCL7 and CCL12/CCL13.10, 17 Trafficking of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes governed by CCR2 appears to have a critical role during viral encephalitis such as WNV infection,18, 19 although whether these cells function to protect or promote pathogenesis is unclear. Indeed, the CCR2\u2013CCL2 axis can provide beneficial or detrimental results, depending on the context of immunopathological diseases caused by sterile and non\u2010sterile stimuli.10, 17 These various results mainly depend on the trafficking of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes, which affects progression of neuroinflammation. Therefore, CCR2\u2010deficient mice showed highly increased susceptibility to neuroinflammation caused by WNV infection with early decreased CNS infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes,18 whereas the recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes exacerbates intracerebral haemorrhage, depending on CCR2.20 CCR2, but not its ligand CCL2, also exhibited an important role in regulating the progression of encephalitis caused by infection with coronavirus via an intracerebral route.21, 22 Collectively, results indicate that the role of the CCR2\u2013CCL2 axis in progression of viral encephalitis is complicated, depending on the context of the viral encephalitis.",

Uncovering the role of CCR2/CCL2 in JE progression may be a prerequisite for developing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies because CCR2/CCL2 blockers remain a possibility in developing therapeutic strategies for immunopathological diseases. In this study, we explored the role of CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 in JE progression following JEV infection. Somewhat surprisingly, CCR2 and its cognate ligand CCL2 differentially regulated JE progression. CCR2\u2010deficient mice showed enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation provided highly increased susceptibility to JE. Subsequently, we investigated pathological features as well as innate NK cell and T\u2010cell adaptive immune responses in CCR2\u2010 and CCL2\u2010ablated mice. Starkly contrasting regulation of JE severity by CCR2 and CCL2 was closely associated with CNS infiltration by peripheral leucocytes, including CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi granulocytes. However, innate NK cell and T\u2010cell immune responses appeared to provide no contribution to JE progression. Our results also revealed that CCL2 produced by leucocytes derived from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) played a dominant role in the CNS accumulation of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes, thereby exacerbating JE progression. These results suggest that blockage of CCR2, but not CCL2, will allow for the development of strategies for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of JE.",

However, the role of CCR2/CCL2 signals in viral encephalitis caused by neurotrophic flaviviruses such as JEV and WNV is not fully elucidated. To investigate the role of CCR2 and its ligand, CCL2, in flavivirus\u2010induced encephalitis, the impact of CCR2 and CCL2 molecules in JE progression were assessed by evaluating the susceptibility of CCR2 KO and CCL2 KO mice to JEV infection. Somewhat surprisingly, CCR2 KO and CCL2 KO mice were observed to induce completely contrasting regulation of JE. While CCR2 KO mice showed increased resistance to JE compared with wild\u2010type C57BL/6 mice (P = 0\u00b71170 for 3\u00b70 \u00d7 107 pfu; P = 0\u00b70526 for 5\u00b70 \u00d7 107 pfu), CCL2 KO mice were highly susceptible to JE (Fig. 1a). Notably, CCL2 ablation resulted in marked increases in mortalities, with 80% and 90% for CCL2 KO versus 40% and 55% for C57BL/6 mice following JEV infection (3\u00b70 \u00d7 107 and 5\u00b70 \u00d7 107 pfu, respectively). Likewise, CCR2 KO mice showed delayed signs of neurological disorder with a lower frequency of occurrence, while CCL2 KO mice displayed more rapid and frequent signs of neurological disorder compared with C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1b). CCL2 KO mice, but not CCR2 KO mice, also showed more apparent loss of body weight depending on infection date (Fig. 1c). Collectively, these results clearly indicate that ablation of CCR2 and its cognate ligand CCL2 differentially affects the outcome of neuroinflammatory disease caused by JEV.",

As expected, CCL2 KO mice showed highly increased expression levels of all tested CC and CXC chemokines except CCL17, whereas CCR2 KO mice showed lower expression levels of chemokines including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7 and CXCL2 following JEV infection (Fig. 5a).

CCL2 KO mice also showed enhanced activity of NK cells upon JEV infection when evaluated by enumeration of NK cells producing IFN\u2010\u03b3 and granzyme B in response to stimulation of PMA plus ionomycin. CCL2 KO mice thereby contained an enhanced total number of NK cells producing IFN\u2010\u03b3 and granzyme B (Fig. 6c,d).

To this end, BM chimeric models of wild\u2010type C57BL/6 and CCL2 KO mice were used. CCL2 produced by myeloid cells derived from HSCs played a dominant role in exacerbating JE progression because CCL2 KO recipients of wild\u2010type C57BL/6 BM donor cells (WT\u2010KO) showed comparable susceptibility to JE with CCL2 KO recipients of CCL2 KO BM donor cells (KO\u2010KO), whereas wild\u2010type C57BL/6 recipients of CCL2 KO BM donor cells (KO\u2010WT) exhibited almost identical resistance to JE as those of the WT\u2010WT BM chimeric model (Fig. 8a).

The results revealed no significant change in the frequency of splenic CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes between four CCL2 KO BM chimeric models (Fig. 9a). Following JEV infection, the frequency of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in the blood of wild\u2010type C57BL/6 recipients of CCL2 KO BM donor cells (KO\u2010WT) showed no significant difference from those of the WT\u2010WT BM chimeric model with higher levels. The WT\u2010KO BM chimeric model showed the lowest frequency of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in blood compared with the levels found in the KO\u2010KO BM chimeric model. Instead, the KO\u2010KO BM chimeric model showed higher frequency of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in blood than other BM chimeric models. With regard to CNS\u2010infiltrated leucocytes, CCL2 KO recipients of wild\u2010type C57BL/6 BM donor cells (WT\u2010KO) showed a markedly higher frequency of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in the brain compared with WT\u2010WT and KO\u2010WT BM chimeric models. The KO\u2010KO BM chimeric model also showed the highest frequency of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in the CNS. The accumulated number of splenic CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes was not changed between CCL2 KO BM chimeric models, whereas WT\u2010KO and KO\u2010KO BM chimeric models contained fewer CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in blood but not fewer CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes (Fig. 9b,c). The WT\u2010KO and KO\u2010KO BM chimeric models showed a high number of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in the CNS compared with WT\u2010WT and KO\u2010WT BM chimeric models (Fig. 9d). Ultimately, these results support that CNS infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes was preferentially mediated by CCL2 produced from leucocytes derived from HSCs, resulting in close association with JE exacerbation.",

Infiltration of the CNS by Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in CCR2\u2010 and CCL2\u2010ablated mice appeared to be coupled to trends of CC and CXC chemokines and chemokine receptor expression.

            "text": "Central nervous system infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes is a typical feature of CNS inflammation caused by sterile and non\u2010sterile insults.29, 42 These cells migrate into the injured brain, where they are believed to differentiate into dendritic cells, macrophages and microglia.19, 29, 30 However, the role of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in immunopathology of the CNS is debatable, depending on the encephalitis context. CNS infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes provides significant damage and destruction to the CNS in several models of CNS diseases,31, 32 whereas CNS infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes plays an important role in conferring protection against neuroinflammation, such as WNV\u2010induced encephalitis.18, 22, 33, 34 Our results clearly favour the former notion because CCR2\u2010ablated mice showed enhanced resistance to JE along with decreased CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes, rather than high susceptibility to JE. In contrast, CCL2\u2010ablated mice contained highly increased CNS infiltration by Ly\u20106Chi monocytes, resulting in markedly increased mortality following JEV infection. The role of CCR2 in regulating Ly\u20106Chi monocyte egression from BM has been critically demonstrated under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.43, 44 Genetic ablation of CCR2 results in severe monocytopenia that provides partial or entire loss of these cells in inflamed tissues, as per the results demonstrated in this study. CCR2\u2010mediated recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes was reported to play a critical role in conferring protection from viral encephalitis caused by WNV,18 which is closely related to members of the Flaviviridae family along with JEV. Also, higher mortality and increased pathogen burden were seen in several pathogen infection models, such as Toxoplasma,45 herpes simplex virus type 246 and coronavirus,21, 22 when Ly\u20106Chi monocytes were depleted. These facts are in contrast with our data showing that CCR2\u2010ablated mice contained no changes in the viral burden of extraneural and neural tissues. However, our results provide a similar conclusion that CCR2\u2010mediated recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes is detrimental to the progression of diseases, such as lung injury caused by influenza virus infection47 and herpes simplex virus encephalitis.48 On the other hand, Ly\u20106Chi monocytes are direct targets for pathogens such as HIV,49\nListeria\n50 and Toxoplasma,45 which suggests that infected monocytes are directly responsible for dissemination of infection in a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 fashion into the CNS, thereby facilitating disease progression. Similarly, CD11b+ Ly\u20106Chi monocytes were observed to facilitate JEV replication.26 Therefore, highly increased levels of viral burden in the CNS of CCL2\u2010ablated mice may be strengthened by elevated CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes.",

            "text": "Our results also indicate that recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes into inflamed sites does not completely depend on the CCR2\u2013CCL2 axis. Indeed, other chemokine receptors and chemokines are probably responsible for recruiting Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in CCL2\u2010ablated mice because chemokine responses can be redundant. CCR2 can bind to CCL7 and CCL12, as well as other chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 and CXCR3, which may participate in the infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes into the CNS.10 In support of this, CCL7 and CCL12 expression was increased in the CNS of CCL2\u2010ablated mice following JEV infection. Hence, these chemokines may be in part responsible for the enhanced CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in CCL2\u2010ablated mice. Paradoxically, transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS is detrimental to CNS diseases caused by intracranial infection with coronavirus, rather than showing a beneficial role in progressing viral encephalitis.51 Even though viral encephalitis is induced in CCL2 transgenic mice through a different virus strain and inoculation route, transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS provides ineffective clearance of the virus and a highly increased mortality, along with increased CNS infiltration of leucocytes. This fact may indicate that CNS infiltration of peripheral leucocytes is coupled to viral burden, no matter how the viral encephalitis is induced. Considering that CCL2 function appears redundant and can be replaced by the activity of other chemokines,10, 17 it was interesting that lacking a single chemokine CCL2 drove the dramatic phenotype of progressing viral encephalitis caused by JEV. The complicated network of chemokine responses in progressing JE remains to be defined at the molecular level to uncover which steps play a critical role in regulating JE.",

            "text": "One interesting finding of this study was that ablation of CCR2 or CCL2 induced accumulation of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in extraneural and neural tissues. Notably, CCL2 ablation appeared to provide more apparent accumulation of Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in the blood and brain. In line with this finding, deficiencies of CCL2 and CCR2 were observed to induce infiltration of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes into inflamed tissues in a few disease models, such as herpetic stromal keratitis46 and arthritis caused by Chikungunya virus.52 Although Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes are a type of innate immune cell involved in immunopathology, their role in viral diseases such as viral encephalitis remains obscure. Because CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes contain myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells that were recently described as a regulatory cell population in various inflammatory reactions,53 it is possible that gradual increases in Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes are involved in the resolution of disease progression. In contrast, dominant infiltration of Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes could exacerbate diseases by preventing replacement of inflammatory monocytes with M2 macrophages that have high efferocytosis activity, as efferocytosis is a key driver of inflammation resolution.54 Our results revealed that CCL2 ablation induces over\u2010expression of CXCL2 (formerly called MIP\u20102), which is a strong chemoattractant for Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes. Conceivably, this over\u2010expression of CXCL2 in the CNS of CCL2\u2010ablated mice is secondary to CNS entry of the infectious virus from the periphery through Ly\u20106Chi monocytes. Therefore, CNS accumulation of CD11b+ Ly\u20106Ghi granulocytes in CCL2\u2010ablated mice is probably a secondary phenomenon caused by over\u2010expression of CXCL2 and depending on viral entry during JE progression. Ultimately, this dysregulated CNS accumulation of peripheral innate immune cells may exacerbate JE progression.",

A similar study demonstrated the dominant role of CCL2 produced by HSC\u2010derived leucocytes in recruiting Ly\u20106Chi monocytes into inflamed sites in mucosal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1.55 CCL2 is secreted by a variety of cell types, including endothelial, fibroblast, epithelial, smooth muscle, mesangial, astrocytic, monocytic, and microglial cells, either constitutively or after induction by oxidative stress, cytokines, or growth factors.41 CCL2 production can also be induced by stimulation with type IFNs (IFN\u2010I) alone through an IFN\u2010responsive element in the CCL2 upstream promoter.56 Hence, pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and IFN\u2010I produced by a facilitated inflammatory reaction in the CNS of CCL2\u2010ablated recipients could affect peripheral leucocytes derived from HSCs. This promotes CCL2 production by HSC\u2010derived leucocytes and subsequently facilitates recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes to the CNS. This speculation is based on results that decipher the detailed pathway to establish orchestrated mobilization of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes through CCL2 produced from HSC\u2010derived leucocytes.55 However, it was interesting that CCL2 produced from tissue\u2010resident cells in the CNS restrict the progression of JE because WT recipients of CCL2 KO BM donor cells (KO\u2010WT) exhibited comparable resistance with the WT\u2010WT BM chimeric model. Considering that CCL2 produced by resident microglia and glia cells causes the recruitment of TNF\u2010 and inducible nitric oxide synthase\u2010expressing macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells,57 it is likely that CCL2 produced by resident cells may contribute to control viral dissemination in the CNS. Collectively, although the detailed role of CCL2 produced from HSC\u2010derived leucocytes in CNS recruitment of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes remains to be defined, our results provide insights into the role of CCL2 produced from HSC\u2010derived leucocytes in exacerbating JE progression.",

Although we did not define why CCR2\u2010ablated mice exhibited reduced T\u2010cell responses, such reduced adaptive T\u2010cell responses may be derived from decreased antigen burden in CCR2\u2010ablated mice. Because NK\u2010cell\u2010depleted mice show changes in viral burden or survival,58 our data support that NK cell responses do not significantly contribute to host survival. This notion is also consistent with the absence of a protective role of NK cells and immune escape from NK cell attack by up\u2010regulation of MHC I in flavivirus infection models.59, 60 Therefore, it is unlikely that IFN\u2010\u03b3 production and cytolytic function by NK cells is dominant in regulating JE progression. Adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses, which require time to develop, are also unlikely to play a role in regulating early viral replication in extraneural and neural tissues. In general, infected CCR2 KO and CCL2 KO mice began showing neurological signs, including paresis and rigidity, from 4 dpi before protective adaptive immune responses are developed. Hence, mice surviving at 7 dpi were used to determine adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses specific for JEV antigen. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the contrasting susceptibility of CCR2\u2010 and CCL2\u2010ablated mice to JE progression probably depends on CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes. However, our data did not provide defined results indicating how the ablation of a single chemokine CCL2 induced highly increased expression of CXC and CC chemokines in the CNS, resulting in CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes and enhanced susceptibility to JE. Although our data showed that CCL2 produced from HSC\u2010derived leucocytes plays an important role in CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes, the detailed cascade pathway to induce CNS infiltration of Ly\u20106Chi monocytes in CCL2\u2010ablated mice remains to be investigated at the molecular and cellular levels.",
