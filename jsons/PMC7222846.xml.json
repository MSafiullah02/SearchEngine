            "text": "Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) is an obligate, intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium and an economically relevant pathogen in poultry and pet birds, where it causes psittacosis/ornithosis, as well as being a human pathogen that causes atypical pneumonia after zoonotic transmission [1]. In the period from 1890 to 1930, human psittacosis outbreaks in Europe and America can all be attributed to contact with sick birds [2]. Later, due to improved knowledge on etiology and epidemiology, as well as the use of antimicrobials in therapy, large outbreaks became rare exceptions. However, what should still not be ignored is that chlamydiosis is still widespread and represents a major factor of economic loss to the poultry industry, as well as a permanent risk for zoonotic transmission to human [3]. Apart from overt clinical manifestations, latent C. psittaci infection can cause recurrent and chronic diseases that have an adverse effect on the production performance of animals. Recently, C. psittaci prevalence in birds has been reported around the world. For example, Dickx found 58.0% prevalence in feral Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Belgium [4]; meanwhile, Cong\u2019s study revealed a high C. psittaci seroprevalence in pet birds, market-sold adult chickens, ducks, and pigeons in north-western China [5,6]. In our previous survey, C. psittaci-specific serum antibodies and antigen were detected in 10.0% and 26.7% of the studied birds, respectively, suggesting that C. psittaci prevalence in Beijing is like that reported in European cities. Moreover, the highly positive antigens in pigeon fanciers suggest that exposure and possible zoonotic transmission of C. psittaci from racing pigeons to humans highlights an ongoing form of transmission [7]. The study of Wang et al. demonstrated the existence (22.22%) of C. psittaci infection in pigeons in northern China [8].",

H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in multiple countries due to the occurrence of virulent strains, resulting in great economic losses, such as reduced egg production and high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens [11]. What is worse is that more human infections with H9N2 have been reported since 2014. In a previous study, the results showed that poultry workers had an overall H9N2 seroprevalence of 1.87% and a seroprevalence of 8.78/1000 person-years, which is significantly higher than those of H7N9 and H5N1 [12]. More importantly, H9N2 has particularly significant implications due to its widespread circulation in domestic poultry, especially in the presence of other coinfecting pathogens. For example, coinfection with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and H9N2 caused more serious synergistic pathogenic effects, and indicates the role of both pathogens as complicating factors in poultry infections [13]. Some researchers have also studied the effect of two major pathogens\u2014namely, H9N2 and avian infectious bronchitis (IBV)\u2014in multiple infections [14].",

However, these two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens, and thus can aggravate diseases. More recently, it was reported that C. psittaci and H9N2 often cause mixed infections in clinic. Our previous study found that C. psittaci infection increases the mortality of avian influenza virus H9N2 by suppressing the host immune response [15]. In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), and Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) contributes to severe pneumonia and a high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, explaining why severe avian airsacculitis is prevalent in the winter season in northern China [16].

The depletion of macrophages from mice prior to infection with Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) and C. psittaci results in increased morbidity and pathogen burdens [17,18]. Macrophage activities may not contribute to pathogen clearance, because C. psittaci is able to survive and deliver to other tissues by using the macrophage as a \u201cvehicle\u201d [19]. Macrophages activated by interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are associated with increased mortality of macrophages, nitric oxide (NO) production, secretions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines [20]. In this study, we illustrate the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11. Based on previous animal studies, we postulate that C. psittaci infection might be beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11 macrophages by impairing the macrophage functions. ",

Moreover, the iNOS expression and enzyme activity, as well as NO concentration, of HD11 cells were significantly reduced compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. In other words, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2 could stimulate HD11 cells to express less iNOS and NO compared to infection with H9N2 alone. In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells than H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Furthermore, both the mRNA expression and cytokine levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly increased at 24 hpi in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group. On the contrary, the Th1 cytokines of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 were significantly increased in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone at the early stage. Later, only TNF-\u03b1 secretions were increased significantly compared to those of the C. psittaci group at 24 hpi.

It also suggested that we should consider primary infection by C. psittaci in any respiratory disease, and should eradicate it during the treatment of avian respiratory disease. In addition, other studies have also reported the role of C. psittaci and H9N2 in the pathogenesis of coinfection. In this sense, coinfection is a common infection of two or more pathogens in the same host. Similar coinfection occurs frequently in human cases. For example, in 1918, in the human influenza virus pandemic, almost all cases of death were caused by bacteria mixed infection, and the additional bacterial infection greatly increased the risk of death [25]. Moreover, the combination of malaria and helminth is prevalent in less-developed countries [26]. Hence, identifying the primary pathogen of the mixed infection has been underestimated due to limited investigation. Traditionally, low pathogenic avian influenza virus triggers primary infection, and then the secondary infection of bacteria follows [27]. Since 2007, the outbreak of avian airsacculitis has been documented by the mixed infection of various pathogens [28].",

            "text": "Macrophages play an important role in innate immunity, such as phagocytosis, antiviral infection, and enhanced immune regulation. Pathogens infect the body and the monocytes after infection of the main target cells. After entering macrophages, Chlamydia can escape immune surveillance and transport to the whole body with macrophages, and thus macrophages act as the delivery system for Chlamydia [19]. Therefore, it is necessary to study how macrophages play a role in the host\u2019s immune response to the pathogen, as well as the pathogenesis of the pathogen, after the study of Chlamydia and H9N2 infection. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and its activity have been shown to be involved in the reaction of L-arginine decomposition into NO and L-citrulline. Endotoxin or cytokines, such as LPS and IFN-\u03b3, can induce chicken macrophages to produce iNOS, and to further produce NO [29]. Our research shows that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly decrease the iNOS expression level and enzyme activity, as well as the NO concentration, of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 or C. psittaci infection alone. However, the potential mechanism is unknown. The monocyte macrophage system has the function of phagocytosis and the killing of pathogens and tumor cells directly. In our study, we found that coinfection induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 infection. All this evidence illustrates the mechanism of macrophage dysfunction post-coinfection or after C. psittaci infection alone. Cytokines secreted by macrophages are also important components of their immune regulation. Here, several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were determined by mRNA expression and ELISA cytokine kits. The role of Th1/Th2 cell cytokines is important in the immune response to chlamydial infection. It appears that the Th1 CD4 cell response plays a dominant role in protective immunity, while Th2 CD4 cytokines (particularly IL-10) play a role in the immunopathology of chlamydial infection. Products of Th2 cells do not facilitate the production of IFN-\u03b3 or inhibit Chlamydia growth [30]. TNF-\u03b1 regulates critical cell functions, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. Macrophages are the major producers of TNF-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to play a pivotal role in orchestrating the cytokine cascade in many inflammatory diseases [31]. Increased TNF-\u03b1 levels have been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease post-infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) [32]. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine known to play a critical role in chronic infections caused by intra-cellular organisms. During chlamydial infection, high IL-10 secretion was shown to be associated with pathogenesis in a mouse model of Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection [33]. In the present study, high TNF-\u03b1 production was induced by coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2, and this might be associated with increasing the increased mortality of the HD11 cells. In our results, the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 were increased significantly in the coinfection groups, suggesting that chlamydial infection mediated the polarization of Th1/Th2 to the Th2 direction. The dominant role of Th2 cytokines hampers immune function, so that pathogens can evade immune surveillance and immune attacks. The Th2 polarization was consistent with our previous data, implying that immune suppression is aggravated post-artificial infection with H9N2 and C. psittaci [15].",

Understanding the mechanisms and effects of coinfection will improve the understanding of the common pathogenicity mechanisms. Since 2007, severe respiratory infections and avian airsacculitis in chickens in many parts of China have been the result of coinfection with bacteria and viruses. The role of viral\u2013bacterial coinfection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received enough attention, and should be emphasized in future investigations. We have established a SPF chicken model of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in vivo. At this point, it is urgent to continue to study cell models of coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. In this study, we did such work and found that infection with C. psittaci will increase the replication of H9N2, decrease the iNOS\u2013NO pathway, and raise the IL-6 and IL-10 expression of HD11 cells by H9N2 infection. At the same time, C. psittaci infection can also reduce the phagocytosis of macrophages. Like the results of previous animal models, we found that C. psittaci can reduce the function of immune cells in many ways, thus aggravating the susceptibility of H9N2. In addition, the further findings of this study are that not only does C. psittaci aggravate H9N2 infection, but also H9N2 can increase the mortality caused by C. psittaci infection.
