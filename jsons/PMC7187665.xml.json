            "text": "Influenza virus infection is a worldwide problem and it is the leading cause of respiratory viral disease in hospitalized patients [1\u20133]. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) recommend the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) for hospitalized adults with influenza [4]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) released guidelines on influenza management in 2018, identifying NAIs as first-line therapy in hospitalized patients regardless of illness duration prior to hospitalization, with no differences between oral oseltamivir therapy, intravenous peramivir therapy, or inhaled zanamivir therapy [5]. While there is a consensus on dosing and duration of treatment for outpatients and high-risk population, management of influenza treatment in hospitalized and severely ill patients is suboptimal. In spite of early initiation of NAIs, mortality rates exceed 25% in primary influenza pneumonia with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Critically ill patients are characterized by a variety of conditions that may alter drug absorption, like altered gastrointestinal motility, and pharmacokinetics, such as the need for renal replacement therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Furthermore, in mechanically ventilated patients, administration of inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated because of reported fatal complications, and oseltamivir has to be administered via nasogastric tube [6]. The IDSA recommends against the routine use of higher doses of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAI drugs for therapy of seasonal influenza [5]. Double oseltamivir dose has been used as salvage therapy in presence of ARF in some settings, but robust data are lacking [7]. Peramivir is the only FDA-approved intravenously administered drug for influenza, but optimal dosing regimen remains controversial [5]. To date, there are no unanimous data on NAI use for the treatment of hospitalized patients because treatment dosing, administration route, and duration are still debated in these patients, who require intensive care admission, and effect on outcomes and safety of different therapies is not clear.",

Furthermore, it is widely accepted that the efficacy of NAI treatment is higher if administered within 48 h from symptoms onset [5]. Nonetheless, given the variety of the population enrolled in the published studies, involving both in- and outpatients, treated with different NAI regimens, no consensus exists on which NAI represents the best option in hospitalized patients with influenza. In a meta-analysis [23] of individual participant data in 29,234 hospitalized patients from 78 studies with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 with infection, NAI therapy was associated with a reduction of mortality in the subgroup of ICU patients, compared with no treatment. Moreover, treatment within 2 days of symptoms onset was associated with a reduction in mortality compared with the late administration. In our SR, time from symptoms onset to NAI treatment was heterogeneous among the included studies, from 48 h to 10 days, with median duration of illness from 2 to 5 days, adding a confounding factor. Standardized RCT protocols might help in reducing controllable variables, to equalize studies conducted in different settings, and further investigate NAI time-efficacy.",

            "text": "Oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir are the NAIs currently available, approved for a variety of indications and formulations by the different regulatory agencies (Table 4). Oral oseltamivir therapy is approved to treat patients with uncomplicated influenza by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA); no information is available on safety and efficacy in hospitalized patients [24]. For severely ill patients, double dose oseltamivir has been used in some settings but robust data on its efficacy are lacking, and guidelines recommend against its use [7]. A recent study [25] among adult patients with pandemic influenza requiring ventilator support concluded that oseltamivir had a good enteric absorption, and the dosage of 75 mg twice daily achieved adequate plasma concentrations, far in excess of those required to inhibit viral neuraminidase activity. Accumulation of oseltamivir in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration lead to 4- to 5-fold increase in plasma levels [26]. If oral or enteral administration of oseltamivir is impossible or its absorption is altered, intravenously administered NAIs might be used. Zanamivir is typically used as inhaled drug in outpatients, but lack of safety in subjects with airway diseases limits its use in hospitalized and mechanically ventilated patients [5]. On the basis of the trial from Marty et al. [14], the EMA approved the use of intravenously administered zanamivir 600 mg twice/daily in complicated influenza [5]; this formulation is not FDA approved and not included in the latest IDSA guidelines. Given the recent introduction, to date there are only a few anecdotical case reports and a small case series of four ICU patients treated with intravenous zanamivir therapy, but they showed a high efficacy and tolerability [27, 28]. Intravenously administered zanamivir could represent a good therapeutic option in severely ill patients with influenza infection, not only when oral or aerosolized antiviral medication cannot be administered but also in the unlikely event of oseltamivir resistance. In these cases, intravenous peramivir therapy might also be considered, but it is only approved for uncomplicated influenza and no consensus has been reached on the appropriate dosing and duration of treatment [5]. A recent SR [19] confronted intravenous peramivir therapy vs oral oseltamivir therapy demonstrating peramivir efficacy in reducing TTCR only in outpatients, with no differences in mortality and length of hospital stay for both in- and outpatients. To date, European guidelines do not include indication for intravenously administered peramivir at dosages different from 600 mg single administration in outpatient settings, while IDSA guidelines suggest to consider administering a multiday dosing regimen, although the optimal regimen is unknown. Finally, laninamivir is approved only in Japan (2010), used as a single dose aerosol in outpatients, with no data available in inpatients [29].",

New drugs are being developed, and studied in severe hospitalized patients: baloxavir marboxil is a novel polymerase inhibitor approved in Japan, the USA, and other countries. Two phase III trials [30, 31] in non-hospitalized patients with placebo found that single dose was superior to placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms, and was superior to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing viral replication. A double-blind RCT (NCT03684044) comparing the combination of oseltamivir and baloxavir marboxil to oseltamivir alone is currently in progress in hospitalized patients.",

We judged that the included studies were generally of low quality based upon the selection bias. The main limitation is the heterogeneity in dosage and comparators that precluded a meta-analysis, as well as and the size of the study population (large RCTs are needed) and the inclusion of clinically diagnosed influenza in two studies. Despite identifying many studies (e.g., trials with outpatients or observational studies), there were few RCTs about hospitalized patients with influenza treated with NAIs. None of the included studies assessed the penetration of antivirals into the lung tissue or analyzed the effect of antiviral concentrations on alveolar viral load. No study involving laninamivir met the inclusion criteria. Finally, only a small percentage of mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia were enrolled, and the impact of viral susceptibility on treatment could not be analyzed because of the scarcity of data. Even if rare, NAI resistance might influence the outcomes of different treatment regimens. Only four out of seven studies analyzed viral strain susceptibility pre-treatment, and six studies conducted a post-treatment analysis, with overall only four new resistances identified. The small numbers did not allow a correlation with clinical outcomes; furthermore, different analysis methods were used, not allowing a standardized comparison. Despite these limitations, our study provides information that is not available in the published literature, being an important strength and having implications for further research. Furthermore, the results were based on RCTs, rather than observational cohort studies, so that it illustrates the need for research in the form of RCTs in the subset of patients with respiratory failure requiring hospitalization or ICU admission, focusing on meaningful pre-defined outcome criteria.",
