            "text": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are polyesters accumulated in microorganisms as intracellular carbon and energy storage material under unbalanced growth conditions (Andreeben et al. 2010). Owing to their biodegradability and physical properties similar to most of the synthetic plastics, PHAs are considered as a green substitute for petroleum-derived plastics. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the first discovered, most common and simplest form of PHA found in bacteria (Lemoigne 1926). The inferior physical properties of PHB such as brittleness, high crystallinity and instability during the melting stage hinder their wide-spread applications (Wang et al. 2013). The copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HV), namely poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is synthesized in bacteria especially when the growth medium contains organic acids (Chen et al. 2011). The superior properties of PHBV such as better thermal behavior, plasticity, toughness and biodegradability make them more attractive in the bioplastic market (Shang et al. 2004).",

The former one is synthesized by the condensation of two acetyl-coenzyme A molecules, and the later one is formed by the condensation of acetyl-coenzyme A and propionyl-coenzyme A molecules (Chen et al. 2011). Therefore, when propionic acid is supplemented in the culture medium constituted for PHB production, it acts as a direct precursor that triggers the formation of 3-HV, in addition to 3-HB. This leads to the copolymer accumulation in bacterial cells. PHBV production in genus Bacillus has been reported previously by supplementing the medium with organic acids (Kumar et al. 2006; G\u00fcng\u00f6rmedi et al. 2014; Moorkoth and Nampoothiri 2016).",

Also, it has been reported that electrospun PHBV nanofibers are ideal for skin tissue engineering applications (Sundaramurthi et al. 2013). Nevertheless, reports are also available on further improvement of PHBV by blending with other polymers such as poly(butylene succinate), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(lactic acid), etc. (Modi et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2017). Among these polymers, PEG lacks toxicity, antigenicity and consequently does not induce any immunogenicity on human cells. Hence PEG has been commonly applied in a wide range of therapeutic formulations, and it will be eliminated from the body through kidneys (Catoni et al. 2013). The blending of PHAs with PEG improves the surface hydrophilicity of the polymer; thereby increases the cell viability and it has been reported to be effective in improving the biocompatibility of PHBV (Shabna et al. 2014; Monnier et al. 2016). Therefore, PHBV-PEG blends can have high application potential in biomedical fields.",

The B. aryabhattai strain PHB10 used in the present study is also an environmental bacterial strain, and it has been reported previously for high levels of PHB accumulation in their cytoplasm (Pillai et al. 2017a). The genome of this strain harbours a short-chain-length PHA-specific polymer synthase gene (phaC) responsible for its PHB biosynthesis (Pillai et al. 2017b). In the present study, the PHBV accumulation property of this bacterium was addressed. In-vitro cytotoxicity studies were also conducted to evaluate the potential of these biopolymers and PEG blends thereof in perspective of their skin graft applications.",

We tested the strain PHB10 for accumulation of the copolymer PHBV, in a culture medium supplemented with propionate and the obtained yield (2.8 g/L, 71% of CDM) was better than the previously reported PHBV content of 1.9 g/L (54% of CDM) and 0.9 g/L (26% of CDM) from other Bacillus spp. as reported by Kumar et al. (2006) and Moorkoth and Nampoothiri (2016) respectively. This study is the first report on PHBV accumulation in a B. aryabhattai strain. The optimum temperature for growth and PHBV accumulation was 31 \u00b0C, which was the same as observed during the PHB production studies with this bacterium (Pillai et al. 2017a). Besides, Masood et al. (2012) and G\u00fcng\u00f6rmedi et al. (2014) have also observed that optimum temperature for growth as well as PHA accumulation was in a temperature range of 30\u201335 \u00b0C. The optimum pH for the copolymer production was 7 and the obtained yield showed a significant decreasing trend towards either side of the pH value, which is in agreement with the previous reports on PHBV accumulation in Bacillus spp. (Moorkoth and Nampoothiri 2016; Masood et al. 2012). The PHB accumulation study in this strain (Pillai et al. 2017a) and the reports on PHBV accumulation in other Bacillus spp. suggested the optimum incubation period of 48 h for maximum polymer yield (G\u00fcng\u00f6rmedi et al. 2014; Moorkoth and Nampoothiri 2016) and hence the incubation period was set as 48 h in all the shake flask experiments.",

The main peaks were corresponding to 3-hydroxybutyric acid methyl ester, pentadecanoic acid methyl ester and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester. The 3-hydroxybutyric acid methyl ester is the monomer methyl ester of 3-HB, whereas the pentadecanoic acid methyl ester and the hexadecanoic acid methyl ester are the trimer and tetramer methyl esters of 3-HV and 3-HB respectively (Bhuwal et al. 2014). These oligomers might have been formed as a result of incomplete digestion of the polymer sample during the methanolysis. The chromatogram of PHBV standard also showed the methyl esters of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and pentadecanoic acid. These observations confirmed the obtained polymer as PHBV. The 1H NMR analysis demonstrated the resonances for the methyl group (\u2013CH3), methylene group (\u2013CH2\u2013) and methine group (\u2013CH\u2013) from both the 3-HB and 3-HV monomer units. The 13C NMR spectrum provided the signals for the methyl (\u2013CH3) groups, methylene (\u2013CH2\u2013) groups, ester (\u2013O\u2013CH\u2013) groups and carbonyl carbon (\u2013C\u2013) atoms from the 3-HB and 3-HV monomers. The chemical shift signals were in agreement with the previous findings of Abd-El-Haleem (2009) and Aramvash et al.

Generally, PHBV has a melting point around 100\u2013150 \u00b0C and is decreased with an increase in the amount of HV in PHBV (Wang et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014). The TGA revealed that the obtained polymer began to lose its mass significantly with an increase in temperature from 220 \u00b0C and degrades completely at around 255 \u00b0C. This thermal behaviour was comparable to the thermal properties of PHBV, as reported by Wang et al. (2013). The observations on the thermal behaviour of the copolymer can be attributed to the higher hydroxyvalerate content in the sample, which may improve its ductility and flexibility (Wang et al. 2013).",

Generally, higher values of PDI were observed for compounds with higher molecular weight, especially in polymers recovered by sodium hypochlorite lysis method (Berger et al. 1989). The polymer showed an elongation at break of 13.30% and tensile strength of 10.3 MPa. Previously, PHBV with very low mol% of 3-HV was reported to be with tensile strength 36.2 MPa and elongation at break 1% (Jost and Miesbauer 2018). The PHBV obtained from the PHB10 was having better mechanical properties than PHBV reported by Kuciel et al. (2019). The values are in a range suitable for tissue engineering applications (Little et al. 2011). Elongation at break represents the capability of a material to resist changes of shape without crack formation. The better elongation at break value recorded here indicates the better elastomeric character of the obtained PHBV. The mechanical properties of PHBV obtained in this study suggest that the polymer contained high 3-HV content.",

To get a more reliable information on cytotoxicity of polymer samples intended for skin graft applications, human keratinocytes which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis could be the ideal target. HaCaT cells are the immortalized human keratinocytes which have been widely applied in the studies related to epidermal homeostasis and its pathophysiology (Seo et al. 2012).

In an earlier study, the PHBV surfaces, when modified with PEG decreased the nonspecific adsorption of proteins from plasma and thereby improved the blood compatibility of implanted materials (Wang et al. 2011). Similar observations of improvement in the biocompatibility of PHB were also reported in Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) fibroblast when blended with PEG (Cheng et al. 2003). Studies on neural-associated olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) in the presence of PHB blended with PEG2kDa also reported improved cell viability, biocompatibility and proliferation (Chan et al. 2011). It is evident from these observations that the PHBV when blended with PEG2kDa, did not affect the normal cell growth and proliferation and hence can be effectively used for skin graft applications.",

This study is the first report on PHBV accumulation in this bacterium. The polymer yield can be improved by optimization of the fermentation conditions. The blending of PHBV with PEG considerably reduced the polymer induced cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells, which is a promising result in terms of skin graft applications. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to study further the potential of PHB/PEG blends in the purview of its biomedical applications.",
