Using unapproved investigational drugs in patients with serious life-threatening diseases outside of clinical trials named expanded access or compassionate use [3]. Both Remdesivir and Favipiravir are currently being studied in Iran, without having USFDA or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval; to our knowledge, Japan provided favipiravir in some extent for compassionate use.",

Thus, extraordinary efforts are made to rescue those patients. Several medications were recommended in the different versions of \u201cIran\u2019s Flowchart for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19\u201d since the beginning of the outbreak including oseltamivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ritonavir, ribavirin, and atazanavir [7]. Also, lots of unjustified other medications such as biologics (tocilizumab), high dose vitamin C, remdesivir and favipiravir are recommended and even prescribed in patients with COVID-19 [8\u201311]. To our knowledge, none of these indications are approved and they are administered as off-label medications.",

Doing so could be in contrast to the physician\u2019s professional commitments because they professionally promised to save patients\u2019 life while not harm. In this viewpoint, we aim at taking a brief look at the common national and international regulations (designed by developed countries) of off-label uses and then stating the ethical challenges of off-label administrations in the COVID-19 outbreak for better perception and responsible implication.

            "text": "Unfortunately, in the COVID-19 outbreak, we are observing the third type of off-label uses which seems to be something in between- a kind of trial and error; we call it pseudo-research. The term pseudo-research was previously used by Bowbrick in marketing in that poor scientific method combined with good experimental technique and generates little value [28]. Likewise, we would like to define pseudo-research as using off-label medications in clinical practice without obtaining the patient\u2019s informed consent, and finally publishing the results of drug efficacy as a research article. From the research point of view, because, there is no proposal, the validity of the method is under question, the results are of little value. This manner could be considered unethical research because the first ethical consideration [29] which is the research validity is not perceived. Furthermore, the patients informed consent is waived without the permission of the ethics committee. Also, the sample size is limited; so, the generalizability of the results is under question. In pseudo-research, the researcher who is the main healthcare provider may have confirmation bias because he would like to obtain positive results following his off-label intervention. The confirmation bias is a kind of cognitive bias and the researcher tries to interpret the data by his assumptions and not based on the scientific evidence. Besides, the designation of the pseudo-research may be based on unjustified objectives; so, logical error forms and transfers to others by paper publication.",

Therefore, two scenarios are possible: spontaneous patients recovery which may account for the effectiveness of the off-label intervention or increasing disease severity which may account for the disease progression. The motivation for publishing the resulted data is very high because it helps the authors to become well-reputed, and the paper could be fast-tracked.",

By this approach, the health system will permit and will audit off-label medication administration under tight regulations and based on enough clinical evidence as well as the mutual trust in between which could be the standard practice.
