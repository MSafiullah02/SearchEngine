The pathophysiological mechanisms of neuromuscular respiratory failure in GBS patients, characterized by bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis [20], differ from those in other critically ill patients. Specifically, bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis induce acute respiratory failure through a combination of poor airway protection, inadequate secretion clearance, and hypoventilation [20]. These entities contribute to a high incidence of respiratory complications, including atelectasis and pneumonia, as a major cause of death [2, 21\u201323]. Early tracheostomy may thus provide potentially effective supportive care as well as a reduction in respiratory complications in GBS patients, with potentially favorable outcomes.",

Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model. The independent variables were: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. We used the propensity scores to derive stabilized weights, which maintains appropriate type I error by preserving the sample size in the pseudo-dataset [38]. To assess the performances before and after stabilized IPTW, we compared the covariates using absolute standardized differences, with differences > 10% regarded as an imbalance between the two groups [39]. Stabilized IPTW estimates the average treatment effects over a marginal distribution of measured covariates in the matched cohort.",

While the decision to place a tracheostomy in critically ill patients generally depends on the expected length of required MV, the clinical course, severity, and duration of respiratory failure in mechanically ventilated patients with GBS are highly diverse [29]. Although several studies have addressed the identification of predictors for prolonged MV in GBS patients [5, 9, 29, 40], only limited data are available to provide guidance for decision-making on early tracheostomy at the time of MV initiation. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the extubation outcome, partly because of the difficulty in evaluating the severity of bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis during endotracheal tube placement [7, 41]. Currently, these uncertainties about the management of respiratory failure in GBS patients pose challenges for decision-making on performance of early tracheostomy.",

Using stabilized IPTW analyses to adjust for multiple covariates until the day of MV initiation, we assumed that all GBS patients requiring MV for more than 1 week were potential candidates for tracheostomy. However, the decision on whether to perform tracheostomy in GBS patients has often been discretionary. To address the possibility that both relatively mild and fatal GBS patients were biased in the no tracheostomy group, we conducted a sensitivity analysis including only those who received tracheostomy.",

The current study using multicenter, real-world data from Japan showed that the median time to tracheostomy was 12 days, and only about 15% of GBS patients who received MV for more than 1 week underwent early tracheostomy within 7 days of MV. However, there was a trend toward early tracheostomy in GBS patients becoming more common during the study period. A similar trend was observed in the USA [45]. This trend may reflect the fact that physicians expect potential clinical benefits from early tracheostomy. We expected that mortality and the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, as one of the major causes of death in GBS, would be reduced in the early tracheostomy group [2, 21\u201323]; however, the current study showed no significant association of early tracheostomy with either of these variables. Furthermore, all other secondary outcomes associated with expected effects of early tracheostomy showed no significant differences. The current sensitivity analysis restricted to patients who underwent tracheostomy did not change the main results. These results may be partly explained by difficulties with pulmonary hygiene under conditions of bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis during the progression phase irrespective of the use of early tracheostomy.",

First, the study had a retrospective observational design, and the assignment of early tracheostomy was not random. Unfortunately, because of data unavailability, the study could not account for pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, ventilator settings, and reintubation events. Although we used stabilized IPTW analyses to control for possible measured confounders, our results may have been biased by unmeasured confounders regarding the severity of GBS-associated respiratory failure and GBS itself. However, time from hospital admission to MV initiation [6], neurological presentations at admission [36], and complications at admission [6, 33, 34] were well balanced between mechanically ventilated patients with GBS with and without early tracheostomy. Second, we could not differentiate between percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and surgical tracheostomy [47]. Moreover, we could not obtain data on tracheostomy-associated complications. Third, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia may have been underestimated, because we identified a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia based on ICD-10 codes [37]. Fourth, it remains unclear whether early tracheostomy was associated with earlier transfer to a nursing or rehabilitation facility [45]. However, length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between the early and non-early tracheostomy groups. Finally, although our sample size included a relatively large number of mechanically ventilated patients with GBS, the study may have been underpowered. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the effects of early tracheostomy on clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated GBS patients.",
