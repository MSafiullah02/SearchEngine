One of these clusters also shows antigenic cross-reactivity and contains the canine coronavirus (CCoV), the swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, the feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). Virus particles are enveloped and contain a non-segmented, positive stranded RNA genome 27\u201332 kb in size (Siddell, 1995, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, encoding two polyproteins leading to the viral replicase formation. Downstream to the ORF1b, there are 8\u201310 small ORFs, expressed through subgenomic mRNAs and coding for the structural proteins S, E, M, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and a number of presumptive non-structural proteins (Luytjes, 1995, Enjuanes et al., 2000a) (Fig. 1\n).",

The small membrane protein (E), recognized recently as a structural component of the coronavirions, has been found to be important for viral envelope assembling (Raamsman et al., 2000). The M protein, the most abundant structural component, is a type III glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a long carboxyl-terminal inner domain (Rottier, 1995). The M protein induces antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization although its function has not yet been fully clarified (Woods et al., 1987).",

            "text": "One of the most interesting aspects of coronavirus replication is the occurrence of high-frequency homologous RNA recombination (Lai et al., 1985, Makino et al., 1986). This process is thought to be mediated by a \u2018copy-choice\u2019 mechanism (Cooper et al., 1974, Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986, Makino et al., 1986). Recombination of coronavirus genomes has been observed in tissue culture (Lai et al., 1985, Makino et al., 1986, Sanchez et al., 1999, Kuo et al., 2000), in animals infected experimentally (Keck et al., 1988), and in embryonated eggs (Kottier et al., 1995). There is also evidence for homologous recombination occurring in mouse hepatitis virus in the field (Kusters et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1993, Jia et al., 1995) and recent findings suggest that it may also be an important factor in the evolution of FCoVs (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Herrewegh et al., 1998, Vennema et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Two FCoV serotypes (I and II) have been demonstrated that are distinguishable readily in vitro by virus neutralization assay (Hohdatsu et al., 1991, Hohdatsu et al., 1992). The FCoV type II strains have a CCoV-like S gene which is thought to provide a growth advantage or a mechanism for escaping from the immune response (de Groot et al., 1987). Comparative sequence analysis of type I and type II FCoV and CCoV genomes suggests that the FCoV type II strains arose from a homologous RNA recombination between CCoV and a type I FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Vennema et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996).",

For this analysis, distance values for the M gene were recalculated by trimming the ectodomain region (i.e. by reducing the sequence stretch analyzed from 835 to 681 bp) which did not allow precise phylogenetic inference because of its high heterogeneity (homoplasy). Trees were rooted by using the porcine TGEV isolate Purdue as an outgroup. To appraise the sensitivity of NEIGHBOR-JOINING to the input order of species, the program was run, in a pilot study, by using either fixed or multiple randomized orders of M sequences and by repeating the process ten times. The resulting trees differed slightly but phylogroups and outliers were identical (trees not shown). Since the randomizing option was time-consuming and did not influence segregation, NEIGHBOR-JOINING trees were produced from a fixed order of bootstrapped sequences only and by using the multiple data set option (100 reiterations). Branch lengths were then calculated from the consensus trees using FITCH-MARGOLIASH. Topologies of trees from all of the genomic regions analyzed were very similar, the major phylogenetic lineages defining the FCoV and CCoV genotypes were delineated clearly and generally supported by high bootstrap values. Irrespective of the genome portion analyzed, the CCoV strains Insavc, S378, 45/93, 257/98, A-2/99, 144/01 and 65/00-30, and FCoV TN406 and UCD1, clustered into different phylogroups.

Segregations were supported by high bootstrap values and statistical significance thus emphasizing the robustness of tree topology (Fig. 3\na). Although the number of samples analyzed was smaller and the bootstrap values were lower than for the M gene, the segregation pattern of Italian samples was observed consistently also when analyzed in pol1b-region D (Fig. 3e). The topology of the trees built with the other genome stretches shown confirmed the presence of typical CCoV strains and CCoVs that could not be assigned to either CCoV or FCoV genotypes, although these samples did not fall within a single branch but were dispersed into smaller clusters and located between the outgroup strain and samples belonging to FCoV genotype (Fig. 3b\u2013d).

            "text": "The main purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of genetic diversity among the CCoVs circulating in Italy and to examine their relationships to strains characterized previously. Although our findings are based on a number of samples that is too small to yield firm conclusions, they provide however evidence that the circulating CCoVs in Italy segregate into two separate groups. Interestingly, in the M and pol1b-region D trees the outlier samples were related closely to each other and formed a single phylogroup. Pairwise genetic distances as estimated from multiple nucleotide alignments of these sequences together with those of other reference isolates readily allowed to distinguish the different genotypes, indicating that the fragments analyzed contained sufficient information to characterize the coronavirus-positive samples. The overall nucleotide divergence, shown in Table 4\n, showed that Italian samples were highly heterogeneous with distance values that were not dissimilar from those found between CCoV and FCoV isolates. The matrix of pairwise genetic distances showed that most Italian samples were closely related to the CCoV genotype but the C27/3, 74/99B, 74/99C, A32/99, 79/99, 259/01 and 107/99 samples clearly differed from the others, as they exhibited high distance values from the other Italian isolates and from the reference genotype CCoV isolates (data not shown) and have been therefore tentatively called FCoV-like CCoVs. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that under natural conditions homologous recombination events between highly homologous coronaviruses, such as CCoV and FCoV, occur very frequently. This means that there is a frequent interspecific circulation of either CCoV to cats or FCoV to dogs since mixed infections are required to give rise to recombination. Where the recombination takes place is unknown, but under experimental conditions cats can be infected with CCoV (Barlough et al., 1984, Stoddart et al., 1988, McArdle et al., 1990, McArdle et al., 1992) and, although it has not been demonstrated that FCoV may infect dogs cannot be ruled out. According to this hypothesis, restricted sites of recombination (i.e. regions of very high nucleotide identity between two highly homologous coronaviruses) may exist in the genome of coronaviruses and these sites may readily undergo template switches. This explanation assumes that coronaviruses of domestic carnivores possess a sort of \u2018dynamic\u2019 genome. However, the presence of numerous synapomorphic (shared\u2013derived) signals allowing segregation of outlier FCoV-like CCoVs samples in a single phylogroup, in the M gene and pol1b-region D is compatible with the idea that these samples diverged at approximately the same time from an ancient common ancestor and subsequently underwent independent evolutions. This hypothesis is also consistent with the appreciable variations detected throughout the fragments of the pol1a and pol1b of FCoV-like CCoVs as compared to typical CCoVs. Considerable nucleotide variations, affecting the reliability of a CCoV diagnostic test (nested-PCR), have been already described in a fragment of the M gene of some CCoV strains (Pratelli et al., 2001b).",

(1995); whereas in the sequence of the transmembrane and of the carboxyl-terminal domains there were only a few scattered substitutions (Fig. 2) and most of the substitutions occurring in the M protein of FCoV-like CCoVs were similar to residues typical of FCoV. Although the major immunological role has been attributed to the S protein, both the amino- and the carboxy-termini of the M protein of coronavirus elicit a strong immune response (Enjuanes et al., 2000a). Therefore, the variations observed in the M protein might confer new functions and/or properties to the virus resulting in survival advantages, such as escape from the immune system.",
