The rapid spread of the disease around the globe which originated from Wuhan city of China, has been declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a new human infecting Betacoronavirus belonging to a large family of zoonotic coronaviruses that are enveloped and single stranded RNA viruses, leading to zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases, also called zoonosis are the diseases that are caused by the organisms/infective agents carried by the animals, transferred from animals to humans resulting in illnesses. They might belong to any class of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. During these interactions, there are numerous ways these sources of infections like Coronaviruses, can be contracted to humans from animals via direct contact, food borne, water borne or vectors, resulting in zoonotic diseases (CDC July 2017). The commonly circulating corona viruses in humans are NL63, -HKU1, -OC43 and HCoV2-229E. Although CoVs can quickly bring mutations, leading to novel CoVs, that could transmit from animals to humans (Velavan and Meyer 2020) .",

A unique deletion of eight amino acids in the virulence factor of the COVID-19 was detected in an isolate from an asymptomatic Japanese patient (Cardenas-Conejo et al. 2020) . Additionally, 42 amino acid signatures in the pp1ab was identified that was only present in . Such studies indicates that COVID-19 might have originated by genetic drift from a bat (bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13) (Cardenas-Conejo et al. 2020; . Genetic drift is a kind of mutation that results from a variation in the gene 4 pool over a period. It generally happens when alleles that are the variants of a gene either increase or decrease randomly with time (Honay et.al 2013) . It's been found that the effect of genetic drift is stronger in small population, that's why even a smaller event may result in larger impacts. The same is true for the pathogenicity of the microorganisms especially viruses, that frequently mutates, and impact of genetic drift is high (Kennedy et al 2018).",

Bats act as the prime reservoir to most of the CoVs, circulating in animals, which are not linked with the human infections. Such viruses have ability to mutate rapidly and transform into a novel CoV that can transmit to humans (de Wit et al. 2016) . (2002), when novel CoVs transmitted from bat to humans, resulted in a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (Luk et al. 2019; Drosten et al. 2003) . In Saudi Arabia (2012) another CoVs were transmitted from camels to humans, known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Luk et al. 2019) . The current 2019 novel SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in China is a Betacoronavirus associated to the lineage B or sarbecovirus, a subgenus. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealed 87 -89% nucleotide similarity with bat SARS-related CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45). The epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 was first announced from Wuhan city of China on 31 st Dec 2019, having a local seafood market as a primary source of the virus. From here the infected humans either symptomatic or asymptomatic carried forward and transmitted the virus by direct contact or respiratory droplets to cities and other countries, which finally led to a pandemic (Zhu et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2020 ).",

Thus, public and social health policies such as avoiding contacting with elderly group would be decided to avoid transfer and keep vulnerable people safe (Kelvin and Halperin, 2020) . There are \"silent patients\" which may stay undiagnosed and are able to propagate the virus to considerable groups of people. It seems that children may not be as susceptible to COVID-19, as adults, and even after contracting the virus, they may remain asymptomatic (Guoqing et al, 2020). milder symptoms compared to adults which is also seen early in outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (Hon et al. 2003; Alfaraj et al. 2019; Kwan et al. 2004; Wang, Yuan, et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020; Chen, Guo, et al. 2020) . Additionally this study is the indication that mild symptoms or absence of severe symptoms in children may lead to misdiagnosis and will lead to skip the required test for SARS-CoV-2 and therefore, asymptomatic children might spread the disease (Guan et al. 2020) . A study has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can be found in feces long after throat and nose swabs test negative. However, the maximum number of SARS-CoV-2 infected children, have been found as a part of family cluster outbreak. This is also in accordance with the previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which reported to have 50-80% and 32% of children, infected by household contact, respectively (Al-Tawfiq, Kattan, and Memish 2016; Wang, Yuan, et al. 2020 ).",

The probable justification could be healthy respiratory tissues due to nonsmoking, less exposure to air pollution, etc. As also seen in previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS in 2003 and 2012, respectively, that the underlying diseases was one of the major causes for the increased rate of death among the adults. The co-occurring diseases could be diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity or any autoimmune disease. Among the adults, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition, which is caused by detrimental immune response (de Wit et al. 2016 ) .The intricate imbalance of the immune system over activates the lungs and hence accumulating fluid in the alveoli. Under normal conditions, RBCs rush into these air sacs to pick up new oxygen, however on inflammation of these alveoli, the RBCs stop functioning, making it difficult to breathe. Therefore, the people with ARDS have higher death risk of coronavirus as seen in SARS coronavirus. This is also one of the reasons that frequency of fatality of COVID-19",

The less effect of COVID-19 on children is not because of vaccines, as there is no significant cross reactivity against SARS-CoV, which indicates that decreased symptoms of SARS-CoV in children may be attributed to other reasons (Yu et al. 2007 ). Thymus gland may play a key role in this regard, as it is active in the childhood than adulthood. It is known that thymus housed mainly T lymphocyte, Sarah et al, (2016) reported that there are plasma cells generated by B lymphocyte which are residing in thymus, they studied the phonemic of these resident cells and their potential protective function against viral infections. It was found that starting from the first year of life, CD138(+) plasma cells begin to accumulate in perivascular space of thymus (PST), where they secrete immunoglobulin G (IgG) without additional activation and secrete IgG1 and IgG3 exclusively, the two main antibodies that able to fix the complement on IgG subclasses (Fig 2) .",

Additionally, thymus has a significant role with its resident plasma cells secreting functional antibodies fixing complements, which highly promote the immunity in the starting of early age. Also, the other possible factors involved in decreased clinical severity in pediatric age group could be less exposure to pollutants and increased incidence of viral upper respiratory tract infections, which may result in better immune response due to cross reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

Many other human cell receptors for HCoVs like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, aminopeptidase N, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and O-acetylated sialic acid, are potential proteins for monoclonal based therapy(Jiang et al. 2014; Barton et al. 2014;Huang et al. 2015) Enveloped viruses, also known as endosomal viruses, which are specialized to fuse through endosomal pathways can be minimized by inhibiting specific protease enzymes. In case of CoVs, papain proteases (PLpro) plays an important role in replication and could be a potential target for therapy. Several PLpro proteases have been reported so far, which differ among the CoVs species, making a narrow spectrum PLpro inhibitors, hence act as a potent antiviral drug against specific CoVs (B\u00e1ez-Santos, John, and Mesecar 2015;Que, Wong, and Yuen 2003;Lee et al. 2015).Another way of reducing fusion of SARS-CoV and human cell, is using chloroquine, which increases the endosomal pH and hence inhibits the infection. Additionally, chloroquine has been reported to interfere via glycosylation of SARS-CoV receptors and also suppresses the entry of virus(Savarino et al. 2006;Wang, Cao, et al. 2020).Inhibitors of enzymes like helicase which brings the unwinding of double stranded RNA during the replication is of great importance in treating the COVID-19. Additionally, Immucillin-A, is an adenosine analog that inhibits polymerase of viral RNA in a variety of viruses like SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, DRACO (double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer) initiates the apoptosis of infected cells by targeting double-stranded RNA of virus, without involving healthy cells can also be considered in treating CoVs(Rider et al. 2011)(Warren et al. 2014;Lundin et al. 2014;Rappe et al. 2018) Various vaccines are in progress against HCoVs for preventing the infection, minimizing severity of disease and viral shedding. Spike glycoprotein S and its receptor-binding domain are the main targets for vaccine development. Nonetheless, CoVs has got the privilege of rapid mutation, which is a challenge in the progress of vaccine development(He et al. 2006;Hashem et al. 2019).",

Treatment with interferon-inducers can decrease the death rate of SARS-CoV at the very earlier stages of the disease. Additionally, interferon-\u03b3 to an interferon-I, as a synergistic combination treatment, may amplify the advantages. At the later stages of the disease, considering the immunopathogenic over-reactions leads to possible cytokine storm. (Shahabi et al, 2020; Kelvin, and Halperin 2020) .",
