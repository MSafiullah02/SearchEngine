Storage methods should be available that prevent gross decline of the agent's activity. 11 The agent should be capable of efficient dissemination. If it cannot be delivered via an aerosol, living vectors (e.g. fleas, mosquitoes or ticks) should be available for dispersal in some form of infected substrate. 12 The agent should be stable during dissemination. If it is to be delivered via an aerosol, it must survive and remain stable in air until it reaches the target population. 13 After delivery, the agent should have low persistence, surviving only for a short time, thereby allowing a prompt occupation of the attacked area by the aggressor's troops Based on the criteria, government agencies such as CDC and the Department of Homeland Security compile and monitor viruses which are known to be dangerous in bio-terrorism. One problem of this approach is that the list is compiled manually, requiring extensive specialized human resources and time. Because the viruses are evolving through mutations, biological or chemical change, some biological substances have the potential to turn into deadly virus through chemical/genetic/biological reaction, there should be an automatic approach to keep track of existing suspicious viruses and to discover new viruses as potential weapons. We expect that it would be very useful to identify those biological substances and take precaution actions or measurements.",

            "text": "The problem of mining implicit knowledge/information from biomedical literature was exemplified by Dr. Swanson's pioneering work on Raynaud disease/fish-oil discovery in 1986 [11] . Back then, the Raynaud disease had no known cause or cure, and the goal of his literature-based discovery was to uncover novel suggestions for how Raynaud disease might be caused, and how it might be treated. He found from biomedical literature that Raynaud disease is a peripheral circulatory disorder aggravated by high platelet aggregation, high blood viscosity and vasoconstriction. In another separate set of literature on fish oils, he found out the ingestion of fish oil can reduce these phenomena. But no single article from both sets in the biomedical literature mentions Raynaud and fish oil together in 1986. Putting these two separate literatures together, Swanson hypothesized that fish oil may be beneficial to people suffering from Raynaud disease [11] [12] . This novel hypothesis was later clinically confirmed by DiGiacomo in 1989 [4] . Later on [10] Dr. Swanson extended his methods to search literature for potential virus. But the biggest limitation of his methods is that, only 3 properties/criteria of a virus are used as search key word and the semantic information is ignored in the search procedure. In this paper, we present a novel biomedical literature mining algorithms based on this philosophy with significant extensions. Our objective is to extend the existing known virus list compiled by CDC to other viruses that might have similar characteristics. We hypothesize, therefore, that viruses that have been researched with respect to the characteristics possessed by existing viruses are leading candidates for extending the virus lists. Our findings are intended as a guide to the virus literature to support further studies that might then lead to appropriate defense and public health measures.",

Our objective is to identify which viruses have been investigated with respect to these properties. The main assumption of the proposed approach is that the more criteria are met by a virus, the more suspicious the virus is a potential candidate for bio-terrorism.

These properties are shown in Figure 2 . Then, we assign each property an importance weight based on domain experts' judgment. For example, it is believed that \"virulence\" as MeSH term is much more important than \"cause\" in searching the potential virus. Therefore, for each search keyword, a weight is given based on the importance; this is the domain knowledge, which may lead to better results to identify suspicious virus. After generating all the possible valid combinations of the properties, CSbVS performs the searches for each combination, retrieving all the relevant documents. Each combination has its importance, which is the sum of the weights of the key words used in the combination. Next CSbVS extracts virus names from the downloaded documents for each search keyword and identifies the novel connection of the virus with these properties. The viruses, as a result of each search combination, have the same importance as the search combination. Based on the importance, all the viruses are ranked. Figure 3 shows the data flow of CSbVS. intersection (e.g., V sk1,2 ) contains the viruses that are commonly found in the original document sets. Therefore, we can guess the viruses in V sk1,2,3 are more suspicious than the viruses in V sk1,2 . Here we assume that a virus has to meet at least two criteria to be considered as a potential virus for bio-terrorism. The combinations that consist of only a single criterion are not considered. STEP 2: Searching every keyword against Medline (PubMed) and download the documents relevant to each search keyword. For better recall and precision, we included \"Viruses\" and \"Human\" as MeSH terms into the combinational search. For example, for the \"Virulence\" search keyword, the complete search keyword against PubMed is the following \"Virulence\"",

After searching every search keyword against Medline and generating all the possible valid combination of search keywords, common virus names are extracted for each combination search. Finally, based on the importance of the combinational search, all the viruses are ranked. Table 3 shows the top 143 suspicious viruses; which included all the 21 viruses identified by Geissler (marked in bold.) Figure 7 shows, the recalls are consistent for the three groups. In other words, Geissler's 21 viruses are equally distributed in our Top 143 virus list. It is very important to note that our system is able to find \"West Nile virus\" and \"SARS Virus\", and ranks them in 2 nd and 50 th respectively. ",
