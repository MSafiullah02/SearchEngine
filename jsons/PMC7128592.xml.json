Physical examination revealed an enlarged abdomen, dehydration (\u223c10%), diffuse muscle wasting, the presence of a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm skin tear on the right hind limb (Fig 1\n) and severe, generalised thinning of the skin with prominent dermal blood vessels (Fig 2\n). Neurological examination revealed abnormal mentation with heavy obtunded mental status, unilateral head tilt, imbalance, ataxia, dysmetria, circling to right side, and ipsilateral proprioceptive deficits and weakness. Head tilt, imbalance, ataxia and circling indicated a vestibular system dysfunction. Obtunded mental status, dysmetria and ipsilateral proprioceptive deficits and weakness could be explained by a CNS central diffuse or multifocal lesion with a major component involving the cerebellum, pons and medulla.12\n",

Feline CNS toxoplasmosis typically causes an encephalitis or meningoencephalitis with a lack of gross lesions. Histological findings are microscopic granulomas with intracellular tachyzoites and mononuclear perivascular cuffing.9 Neurological signs are related to the parasite localisation in the brain.14 In this case histological examination revealed a poorly defined malacic area within the cerebellum and brainstem. Specifically, the lesion comprised all right vestibular nuclei, caudal cerebellar peduncle, extending to the flocculus into the cerebellar folia, and was consistent with necrotising and purulent encephalitis with intralesional free T gondii tachyzoites, and occasional protozoal cysts. These lesions could have been related to the neurological signs of a central vestibular syndrome, specifically for obtunded mental status, dysmetria, circling to the right side and ipsilateral proprioceptive deficit and weakness.",

The cat was FIV and FeLV negative and received no immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppression could have been related to the endogenous increase of cortisol that finally may have been associated with the recrudescent toxoplasmosis. It is demonstrated that glucorticoids at clinical dosages (5 mg/kg body weight of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly weekly) for 4 weeks did not induce oocysts shedding in cats recently or chronically experimentally infected with T gondii.23 Conversely, a high dose of glucorticoids (10\u201380 mg/kg body weight of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly weekly) prolonged oocysts shedding and may lead to reactivation of toxoplasmosis in naturally infected cats.24\n",

The majority of the reports of macroadenoma PDH in cats in the veterinary literature showed no obvious central neurological signs.4, 5, 6, 7 One case has been described as macroadenoma with central neurological signs, but the pituitary gland was larger than the case reported here.3 In our case there was no evidence of mass effect or compression by the pituitary adenoma detectable at CT scan, but there were encephalic lesions (cerebellar malacia, multiple necrosis foci in the brain) due to T gondii tachizoites in the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. In the opinion of the authors it is most probable that the neurological signs of a central vestibular syndrome were due to CNS toxoplasmosis. The authors suggest that in feline HAC associated with central neurological signs, it is important to include in the differential diagnosis infective diseases such as CNS toxoplasmosis.",
