The viral RNA genome encodes three major product groups, designated: gag (group-associated antigen) coding for the major internal structural proteins; pol (polymerase) designating the reverse transcriptase enzyme, ribonuclease H, and a DNA-nicking enzyme to aid integration into the host cell genome; and env (envelope) to produce the envelope glycoproteins gp90 and gp45.52 In addition, there are three short segments of RNA that probably code for smaller viral regulatory proteins. The nonglycosylated structural core proteins are less prone to antigenic variation than are the surface glycoproteins. The most abundant of the core proteins, p26, consistently evokes a strong humoral immune response in most infected horses and is used as the basis for most serologic diagnostic tests for the virus.15., 44., 79. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme unique to retroviruses. It catalyzes the conversion of the viral RNA genome to DNA. This complementary DNA (cDNA) can be inserted into host chromosomal DNA, where it effectively hides from host defense mechanisms, persisting in the horse for the rest of its life.",

Factors influencing the efficiency of transmission include the availability of appropriate vectors, the distance between horses, and the virus titer in the blood of infected horses. Tabanids are more likely to transmit virus than mosquitoes for two reasons. The large mouthparts of tabanids are capable of carrying a much larger quantity of blood (up to 10 nL) than are the small mouthparts of mosquitoes.22 In addition, these large mouthparts inflict much more painful bites than smaller insects. Because flies act only as mechanical vectors in the transmission of EIAV and virus does not live long on the mouthparts of these insects (between 30 minutes and 4 hours),34 effective transmission of virus requires that a fly begin feeding on an infected horse, be interrupted, and immediately fly to an uninfected horse and resume feeding.54 The large mouthparts of horseflies and deerflies inflict painful bites, which horses are likely to interrupt by tail swishing, biting, or other body movements. When a fly is interrupted in the middle of a blood meal, it will immediately seek to complete that meal by rebiting the initial host or by biting a nearby animal. The flight range of horseflies can exceed 4 miles,94., 95. but flies will seek to complete their meal as rapidly as possible on the nearest horse. If the initial host is separated from other animals by a distance of 200 yards or more, the fly is much more likely to resume feeding on the original host than it is to fly the distance required to find a new host.21 These considerations form the basis for many state EIAV regulatory decisions.",

After virus or virus-antibody complexes adsorb to horse erythrocytes, they activate complement via the classical pathway,90., 92. and complement-mediated (intravascular) hemolysis results. Alternatively, extravascular hemolysis may occur as complement-coated erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophage-like cells and neutrophils.91., 92. Bone marrow and splenic macrophages from acutely infected horses contain large amounts of hemosiderin and cellular debris indicative of active erythrophagocytosis.",

This test is at least 95% accurate for diagnosis of EIAV infection and remains the most widely used laboratory test for diagnosis. Most horses seroconvert by AGID within 45 days of infection.16 The Coggins test is performed in a layer of agar in a Petri dish. Soluble EIAV antigen is placed in a central well in the agar plate. Surrounding wells contain either positive or negative control sera or test sera. Soluble reagents diffuse radially from the wells into the agar. This establishes a circular concentration gradient for each reactant. When a zone of optimal proportions of soluble antigen and anti-EIAV antibody is reached, an opaque line of precipitate appears. No line of precipitation forms between wells containing negative serum and soluble antigen. Although the AGID test is considered highly sensitive and specific, there have been a few horses identified that had consistently negative or equivocal results that were subsequently proved to be infected with EIAV by inoculation of seronegative horses with blood from the suspect horse.43., 50., 65., 101.\n",

In 1972, the first year of testing, most positive horses were found in Gulf Coast states where temperature and humidity favor a prolonged vector season. In Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 12.8% of 12,086 horses tested were seropositive. In contrast, only 2.6% of 66,675 horses tested in other states were seropositive. By 1975, the percentage of seropositive tests had diminished to 4.4% and 1.06% in Gulf Coast and other states, respectively. The United States map in\nFigure 2 illustrates that the Gulf Coast region still has the greatest number of positive EIA tests, although the absolute numbers have decreased dramatically since the early years of testing. Of 993,712 EIAV tests reported in the United States between October 1,1990 and September 30, 1991, only 2755 (0.277%) were positive. Arkansas had the largest absolute number of positive tests (494) and the highest percent positive (1.65%).55\n",

Outbreaks of disease still occur30 and may be increasing in some areas because of a decrease in vigilance on the part of horse owners, veterinarians, and others. Owners and veterinarians can voluntarily implement a variety of control measures to decrease the chance of exposure of their horses to infected horses. These measures include1.Require a negative EIAV test prior to purchase of any horse, donkey, or mule.2.Require documentation of a recent negative EIA test prior to permitting entry of any new horse to the premises. If a horse originates from a state with a high incidence of EIAV-positive horses (e.g., Gulf Coast states), this test should probably be dated within 30 days of entry to the farm. If a horse originates from a state with a low incidence of EIAV-positive horses, a test within 6 months to 1 year should be adequate.3.Institute fly control measures wherever possible.4.Encourage officials of any event involving the congregation of large numbers of horses to require a recent negative EIA test for all horses participating.5.Test all horses, donkeys, and mules on the premises at least once a year.6.Do not permit injections of different horses with a common needle. Thoroughly disinfect all surgical instruments, tattoo instruments, and teeth floats after each use.\n",

Its ability to evade host immune defenses by lying dormant in apparently healthy animals and by rapidly changing its antigenic determinants is proving to be a major obstacle to vaccine development. Because most infected horses appear clinically normal and a large proportion of horses in this country remain untested, the virus is not likely to be eradicated in the near future. Yet, for the same reason, because most horses infected with EIAV appear clinically normal, there is a tendency for the horse industry to become complacent in its efforts to control the virus. The cooperation of horse owners, veterinarians, and regulatory officials is necessary to keep the threat of EIA in check in the United States.",
