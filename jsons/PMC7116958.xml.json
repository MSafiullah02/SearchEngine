A poor IAQ, caused by the concentrations of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in the air, may lead to harmful consequences to human health. Various pollutants, such as traffic exhaust, dust, pollen, airborne viruses, and toxic and odorous emissions, may enter indoor areas [3]. Recently, a special mode of pollutant transmission, known as interunit dispersion, has gained popularity. Interunit dispersion illustrates the cross-transmission between apartment units within the same multistory building. This airborne transmission mode is highly risky because of the relatively short dispersion distances and transportation time as compared to other modes like pollutants from special dense sources and traffic exhausts [4].",

Second, outbreaks of acutely infectious diseases or even the ordinary flu season [10] may result in airborne viruses or biological aerosols in the airflow, which poses a great threat to public health. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the mechanism and features of interunit dispersion in the urban environment, is necessary.",

Using the tracer gas technique, they found that the reentry ratio of the exhaust air from a lower unit to the immediate upper unit can reach 7%. Their measurements were conducted under real atmospheric conditions that could represent completely authentic wind and weather situations. However, the results of this study were limited to upward transportation between two vertically adjacent units. The pollutants released from the lower unit may also enter other upper units [15]. In addition, the on-site measurements were accompanied by various uncertainties such as the irregular geometries of the residential buildings.",

First, two opposite airflow directions existed in the middle of the street canyon. The wind flow at heights of 0.75m and 1.05m followed the incoming wind direction for most of the measuring time except at a few points, while the wind flow at heights of 0.15m and 0.45m was in the reverse direction. This reveals a counterclockwise-rotating vortex in the street canyon produced by the freestream flow.

Note that previous studies [44] investigating the ventilation using CFD simulations in street canyons with an aspect ratio of 1:1 revealed different results: the researchers found that the rooms located on the lowest and highest floors showed the best ventilation performance. This paradox may be attributed to two reasons. First, Ai et al. [44] used an integral method to calculate the ventilation rate by integrating the mean velocities at the opening, while this experiment adopted the tracer gas method. This may cause a difference in the ventilation distributions in the street canyon. Second, in reality, irregular fluctuations of the incoming wind may lead to complex airflow in the street canyon. Steady-state CFD simulations were unable to account for the instant fluctuations near the openings at the middle height of the street canyon and underestimated the ventilation rate.",

As per equation (4), the term Rk illustrates the fraction of the tracer gas in the source room that reenters another room. Fig. 12\npresents box charts of the reentry ratios of each room with respect to different source locations. The mean and maximum values of each test are also listed. The statistical results indicated that the Rk of each room varied significantly based on the source room location, and the reentry ratio in the 1:1 street canyon could reach 17.7% in the test of BL2.

The tracer transportation characteristics in the street canyon had large differences from the conditions of an isolated building [4,23,24] or building arrays [25,26].

A series of measurements were performed to investigate the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion. The ventilation rates of the source room were acquired by CO2 constant release, and the interunit tracer gas transmission was quantified by the reentry ratio. The conclusions can be drawn as follows:(1)Based on the weather conditions of the test day, the ventilation performance of the source rooms varied with the room location. The ventilation distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side.(2)The interunit dispersion between rooms in the source building changed significantly with the source room location. Owing to a large and stable vortex constructed by the freestream inside the street canyon, the tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction, and the highest Rk value occurred generally in the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route.(3)The general interunit dispersion between rooms in separate buildings was much smaller than that in the source building. However, owing to highly fluctuating wind conditions, rooms located in separate buildings may occasionally have larger reentry ratios than rooms located in the source building.\n",
