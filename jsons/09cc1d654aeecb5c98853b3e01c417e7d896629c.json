            "text": "The functional importance of the SARS-CoV M pro in the viral life cycle makes it a preferred target for discovering anti-SARS drugs. [4] [5] [6] [7] However, in order to apply rational drug design or virtual screening, information on the structure of the target enzyme is required. Initially, this came from homology models of the SARS-CoV M pro that were constructed on the basis of crystal structures of human CoV (HCoV) 229E M pro and of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) M pro that we had previously determined. 4, 8 The SARS virus enzyme shares about 40% sequence identity with these proteinases of group I coronaviruses. More recently, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV M pro has been determined. [9] [10] [11] As with other CoV M pro s, the molecule comprises three domains (Figure 1 ). Domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) are \u03b2- barrels and together resemble the structure of chymotrypsin, whereas domain III (residues 201-306) consists mainly of \u03b1-helices. The active site, containing a Cys\u2026His catalytic dyad, is located in a cleft between domains I and II. Domains II and III are connected by a long loop (residues 185-200). In vitro experiments demonstrated that deletion of domain III abolished almost completely the proteolytic activities of the main proteinases of TGEV and SARS-CoV. 8, 12 This domain is essential for the dimerization of the M pro , 13 which in turn assures proper orientation of the N-terminal residues of monomer B that play an important role for the catalytic activity of monomer A (and vice versa; see below). 9, 10 In all known crystal structures of coronavirus main proteinases, the enzyme exists as a dimer, 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] and dimerization is also observed in solution at slightly elevated concentrations. 8, [12] [13] [14] The dimer is the enzymatically active species because the specific activity increases linearly with increasing enzyme concentration. 14 ",

            "text": "A special feature first discovered for the SARS-CoV M pro (but most probably present in all coronavirus main proteinases) is that in the monoclinic crystals grown at pH 6.0, the two monomers have different conformations around the S1 substrate-binding site, because the loop 138-145, in particular Phe140, as well as Glu166 undergo dramatic conformational rearrangements. As a result, one protomer exists in an active and the other in an inactive conformation. 9 In the latter, the S1 substrate-binding pocket has hole no longer exists due to the conformational change of residues 138-145. When the crystals are equilibrated at pH 7.6 and 8.0, both monomers are in an active conformation. 9 We have proposed 9,10 that these conformational changes are controlled by the protonation state of His163, an absolutely conserved residue at the bottom of the S1 substratespecificity pocket ( Figure 2 ). This subsite is designed to accommodate the P1-glutamine residue of M pro substrates, with high specificity. No other amino-acid side chain must be accepted in this position, in particular not glutamate (as opposed to glutamine). This is achieved by ensuring that over a broad pH range, His163 is uncharged. Two important interactions made by the imidazole ring are responsible for keeping it in the neutral state: (i), stacking or edge-on-face interaction with the phenyl ring of Phe140 ( Figure 2 , left 586 virtually collapsed as a consequence of the reorientation of Glu166, and the oxyanion panel), and (ii), acceptance by its N\u03b41 atom of a strong hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of the buried Tyr161. This means that only the N\u03b52 atom of His163 can normally carry a proton, and it is this nitrogen that will donate a hydrogen bond to the side chain oxygen of the P1 glutamine residue of the substrate (Figure 2 , right panel). 8 In agreement with this structural interpretation, any replacement of the conserved histidine residue (His162 in this case) abolishes the proteolytic activity of HCoV 229E and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) M pro . 15, 16 Furthermore, FIPV M pro Tyr160 (corresponding to SARS-CoV M pro Tyr161) mutants have their proteolytic activity reduced by a factor of > 30. 15 These observations and the absolute conservation of these residues in the coronavirus main proteinases underline the importance of the uncharged state of His163 in binding the substrate with the required specificity.",

In the crystal structure obtained at pH 7.6, where both subunits are found in the active conformation, 9 His172 forms part of the wall of the subsite, being engaged in a salt-bridge with Glu166. At this pH, the histidine is likely to be positively charged, because pK a values of histidine residues involved in salt-bridges tend to be 2 units higher than those of isolated histidines. 17 The His172...Glu166 ion pair also exists in the active subunit of the dimer at pH 6.0, whereas in the inactive one, His172 loses its partner which moves into the S1 pocket, in order to compensate for the positive charge on the protonated His163 at the bottom of the subsite. Furthermore, at pH 8.0, His172 is likely to be uncharged. As a result, Glu166 is no longer fixed at its position in the wall of the S1 pocket, but tends to be flexible and partly blocks the entry to the S1 pocket. 10 These observations nicely agree with the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV M pro , 10,12 which has its maximum at pH 7.0 and about 50% activity each at pH 6.0 (S1 pocket and oxyanion hole collapsed in one subunit of the dimer) and pH 8.0 (wall of S1 pocket no longer stable due to interruption of His172...Glu166 salt-bridge, Glu166 partly blocking the entry to the S1 site). Therefore, we propose that the bell-shaped pH-activity curve of the SARS-CoV M pro is governed by the protonation of His163 on its low-pH side, and by deprotonation of His172 on its high-pH side. 10 In nice agreement with this, Chou et al. 12 reported that the apparent pK a values characteristic of this curve are 5.7 \u00b1 0.4 and 8.7 \u00b1 0.4. However, they discuss that these may originate from the Glu290...Arg4 ion pair, or from the His41...Cys145 catalytic dyad, both less likely options from our point of view. ",

Because the monoclinic form had one monomer in the active and the other in the inactive form when crystallized at pH 6.0, but both of them in the active conformation after equilibration of the crystals at pH 7.6, it was unclear what to expect for the new crystal forms which were crystallized at pH 5.9 (tetragonal form) and 6.6 (orthorhombic).

In any case, our preliminary analysis shows that the same type of conformational rearrangements occur in this crystal form as was observed in the monoclinic crystals, but an ensemble of inactive and active conformations appear to co-exist at all pH values. In fact, the tetragonal crystals of SARS-CoV M pro , containing < 30% solvent, may be less suited for studying the conformational transition because the molecules are tightly packed and seem to have a contracted substrate-binding site.

In the active conformation of the SARS-CoV M pro dimer, the Nterminus of monomer B (which is the inactive subunit at pH 6.0) was shown to interact with the main chain amide and carbonyl of Phe140 and with the carboxylate of Glu166, both of monomer A. 9 This interaction appears to help shape the substrate-binding site of and determined these crystal structures at 2.0 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. monomer A. On the other hand, the collapsed binding site of monomer B lacks these intermolecular interactions, and as a result, residues 1 and 2 of monomer A are disordered and not seen in the electron density. The same observation was made in our X-ray structures derived from the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal forms 10 : here, both monomers are in the inactive conformation, and accordingly, both N-termini are disordered to the extent that no electron density is seen for residue Ser1. When we determined the first structure of a coronaviral M pro , that of the TGEV enzyme, 8 we saw that residues 1-7 were squeezed in between domain III of its own monomer and domain II of the other monomer in the dimer. The same interactions of this segment, which we later called the N-finger, 9 were seen in HCoV 229E M pro and SARS-CoV M . When we deleted residues 1-5 in the TGEV proteinase, the enzyme was almost totally 8 18 pro proteolytically inactive, but the rather surprising finding was that it still forms a dimer. 18 This result has to be seen in light of the finding by Shi et al. that even isolated domain III of SARS-CoV M pro will dimerize. 13 On the other hand, when Hsu et al. removed only residues 1-3 from the enzyme, it retained 76% of its proteolytic activity. 19 Further, in apparent contradiction to the findings by Chen et al., 18 they found that the \u2206(1-4) SARS-CoV M pro was predominantly monomeric at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml. Whatever the reason for the discrepancy might be, it could well be that while the presence and correct placement of the \"N-finger\" is important, the tip of the finger may not be as essential as thought hitherto. In fact, our MD simulations as well as the X-ray structure obtained from the monoclinic form at pH 7.6 also suggested that the active conformation of monomer A can also be retained without direct interaction with residue Ser1 of monomer B, provided residues 3-7 are in the correct position.",

This is probably of biological significance, because the viral polyproteins (of which the M pro is a domain before self-activation by autocleavage) assemble on the late endosome where local pH tends to be acidic. For designing inhibitors of the M pro , knowledge of the dynamics of the target will be essential. This has been clearly demonstrated in the case of HIV-1 proteinase over the years, where understanding the flexibility of the enzyme did not only turn out to be a prerequisite for designing potent inhibitors but also for explaining many of the observed drug-resistance mutations. Today, HIV proteinase is perhaps the one enzyme best understood in terms of structure and dynamics, and this knowledge is mainly based on several hundred crystal structures, most of them complexes with various inhibitors. In terms of number of crystal structures, HIV-1 proteinase is probably followed by trypsin and lysozyme, but extrapolating from the current research activities, coronavirus main proteinases are likely to catch up.",
