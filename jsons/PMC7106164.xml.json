After measurement (30 seconds), the ratio of 100- and 200-nm beads was calculated. Alternatively, the quantity of particles detected in a fixed timeframe of 30 seconds was determined. The numbers of detected particles in this timeframe were plotted against the dilution factor. Linear regression analysis was performed using Prism (version 3.0, GraphPad Software). The intersample variation was determined by preparing seven individual tubes with identical bead dilutions, after which the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of the number of beads detected in 30 seconds was calculated. The intrasample variation was determined by repeated measurements of the same bead dilution with 30-second time intervals.

For cells and particles larger than 500 nm the amount of light scattered at small angles (0.5\u201315 degrees), i.e., forward scatter (FSC), is commonly used as a rough indication of their size.26 However, particles with sizes near and below the wavelength of light (NPs) scatter proportionally more light at larger angles (15\u2013150 degrees).26, 27, 33 We have used a flow cytometer equipped with a photomultiplier tube detecting forward scattered light at 2\u201325 degrees (wide-angle forward scatter detection). We further increased the sensitivity for small particle detection by increasing the minimum detection angle to 14 degrees, resulting in an increased signal-to-noise ratio.27 In addition, we used fluorescence threshold triggering to discriminate fluorescently labeled particles of interest from noise signals (Supplementary Figure S1 A\u2013D). With this set-up, 100- and 200-nm fluorescent beads could be selectively detected above the fluorescence threshold, and we achieved an unprecedented clear wide-angle FSC-based separation of these bead populations (Supplementary Figure S1 C\u2013D). Light scattered at 90 degrees (side scatter, SSC) has also been used for analysis of small particles.34 However, SSC and backward scatter are more sensitive to changes in the geometry and internal structures of small particles.33 More important, we observed that the resolving power (change in light scatter with particle size) of the wide-angle FSC was greater than that of the SSC (Supplementary Figure S1 E). Based on these findings, we selected wide-angle FSC for relative sizing of nanosized particles.",

To determine whether our flow cytometry-based method can be used to quantify nanosized particles, dilutions of 100-nm beads were mixed with a fixed number of 200-nm beads as a reference and measured. The ratio of detected 100- versus 200-nm beads correlated linearly with the dilution factor (R2 = 0.999) with the predicted slope (Figure 1\n, A), demonstrating that nanosized particles could be accurately quantified at a large range of concentrations. A disadvantage of using reference beads is that they can stick to the biological NPs of interest. Therefore, as an alternative we used a fixed timeframe for quantification (Figure 1, B). An important finding was that the absolute number of measured 100-nm beads deviated < 10% from the specified number of input beads over a large range of concentrations (Figure 1, B), confirming that the complete population of beads was detected above the fluorescence threshold and that noise signals were eliminated. Using this time-based quantification method, the inter- and intrasample variations were 5.3% and 0.6%, respectively.",

Virions were 100 \u00b1 30 nm (corroborating previous data32), and liposome preparations I and II were 95 \u00b1 26 nm and 123 \u00b1 45 nm, respectively (Figure 2\n, C, G). Using our flow cytometry approach, CFSE-labeled mouse hepatitis coronavirus could be clearly discerned based on fluorescence, and the wide-angle FSC level was in the range of the 100-nm fluorescent beads (Figure 2, A, B). In addition, the calcein-labeled liposomes were clearly detected above the fluorescence threshold (Figure 2, D, E), and the largest liposome preparation showed a slightly increased wide-angle FSC level. In comparison with 100-nm beads and the virions, the liposomes displayed a relatively low wide-angle FSC value (Figure 2, F). This finding is most likely due to the low refractive index of these liposome preparations, indicating that particle composition also influences wide-angle FSC levels. Although the light scattering values cannot be used for absolute sizing, we conclude that wide-angle FSC can be used for approximate sizing, as well as for relative sizing of nanosized membrane particles and vesicles with a comparable composition.",

This finding can be explained either by T cell-induced secretion of DC exosomes30 and/or the additional presence of T cell exosomes.36 To discriminate between T cell- and DC-derived exosomes, DC exosomes were in addition to PKH67 also selectively labeled with fluorescently labeled antibodies against MHC class II (MHCII). MHCII is incorporated into DC exosomes30, 37 but is absent on mouse T cells and T cell-derived exosomes. MHCII stained vesicles were detected in those sucrose fractions containing DC exosomes (Figure 5, B), with signals well above isotype control antibody staining (Figure 5, B, C). The MHCII staining levels of DC exosomes were variable. Vesicles floating at a relative high density (1.18 g/mL) contained the highest amount of MHCII (Figure 5, B). Besides MHCII-positive exosomes, MHCII-negative vesicles also were observed (Figure 5, C). This suggests that DC can also secrete vesicles that contain little or no MHCII. Exosomes derived from murine T cells were all negative for MHCII (Figure 5, C). In DC-T cell co-culture supernatants, both MHCII-positive and MHCII-negative populations of exosomes were found (Figure 5, C). In comparison with DC cultures, the relative amount of MHCII-negative exosomes was increased in DC-T cell co-cultures, indicating a contribution of T cell exosomes.",

For the larger membrane vesicles in human blood (> 300 nm), FSC-based flow cytometric analysis appeared to be a reproducible method for high-throughput, multiparameter analysis at the particle level.23, 24, 25\n,\n39 However, the majority of secreted membrane vesicles in body fluids are in the nanoscale size range (50\u2013100 nm),19 which cannot be visualized by conventional FSC-based analysis.23, 24, 25 Techniques that allow phenotypic analysis of individual nanosized membrane vesicles, including immunoelectron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, preclude analysis of large numbers of vesicles needed to study their quantity and heterogeneity.3, 19 Recently, NTA has been described as a method to analyze cell-derived membrane vesicles.21 Although NTA is a powerful method for size analysis, quantitative measurements are less precise in samples containing differently sized vesicles21 and the number of parameters that can be analyzed simultaneously is limited. These limitations pose a disadvantage for the analysis of biological fluids containing many different types of cellular membrane vesicles. We here described a novel flow cytometry-based method allowing simultaneous high-throughput quantitative analysis and multiple-parameter phenotyping of individual nanosized membrane vesicles. This methodology proved suitable for the accurate and absolute quantification of nanosized particles over a wide range of concentrations, setting the stage for its applicability in biomarker analysis. Importantly, we demonstrated that antibody-mediated detection of multiple specific proteins on individual membrane vesicles allowed discrimination of phenotypically different vesicle subsets.",

            "text": "Several features of the selected high-end flow cytometer contributed to the high sensitivity of fluorescence and light scatter detection. First, the selected BD Influx flow cytometer, like some other new generation flow cytometers,23 uses wide-angle FSC instead of the conventional FSC (< 15 degrees) to improve small-particle detection. Second, the BD Influx is fitted with a high-performance photomultiplier tube instead of a photodiode (used in other flow cytometers) for detection of FSC signals. Third, we used fluorescence threshold triggering, which was crucial to distinguish nanosized fluorescently labeled particles of interest from noise signals with overlapping light scattering properties. Importantly, the sensitivity by which the BD Influx detected fluorescently labeled membrane vesicles above the threshold was higher in comparison with other flow cytometers, such as the BD FACSCanto II and the Beckman Coulter Gallios, making it better suited for accurate quantification and characterization of complete vesicle populations. Because our method is based on both optimized wide-angle FSC detection and fluorescence thresholding, the exact lower detection limit for the described technology not only depends on the size of the particles but also on the brightness of labeling, allowing the detection of the entire population above the fluorescence threshold. There are two important advantages of using a labeling method for indiscriminative detection of the entire membrane vesicle population above the fluorescence threshold. First, particles of interest can be accurately quantified because all noise signals are eliminated. Second, by combining the general fluorescent labeling with labeling for a specific marker, vesicle subsets can be identified and related to the entire membrane vesicle population. To analyze fluorescently labeled membrane vesicles, removal of unbound soluble and aggregated dye is very important. Simple washing by sedimentation through ultracentrifugation was not efficient to remove dye aggregates, which appeared above the fluorescence threshold with scatter levels just below those of 100-nm beads. Density gradient ultracentrifugation was therefore crucial to separate the vesicles from unbound dye and simultaneously allowed the identification of membrane vesicles subsets with distinct buoyant densities.",
