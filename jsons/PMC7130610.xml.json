The manufacturing process of SDPP involves several biosecurity features including collection only from healthy animals at commercial abattoirs under competent authorities inspection, pooled blood which contains antibodies with neutralizing capacity against a variety of pathogens, spray-drying at 80 \u00baC throughout its substance, and extended storage time at controlled temperature (Bl\u00e1zquez et al., 2017, 2018). However as technology develops, additional redundant safety features should be investigated that follows the recommendations of several international agencies (EMEA, 1996; WHO, 2004).",

Furthermore, the presence and possible transmission of other potential contaminating agents of importance for the swine industry, such as Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), Swine Influenza A virus (SIV), Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Swine rotavirus A (RVA), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Border disease virus (BDV), Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Salmonella enterica were evaluated.",

By the intraperitoneal route, the main route of absorption of an inoculated material is through the mesenteric blood vessels, which drain into the portal vein and pass through the liver (Lukas et al., 1971). In consequence, a certain amount of the injected liquid may pass directly across the diaphragm through small lacunae and into the thoracic lymph (Abu-Hijleh et al., 1995) and then to systemic circulation.

However, UV irradiation with the SurePure Turbulator system at 3000 J/L or more was enough to avoid transmission of any of the tested viruses to the animals. The irradiation at 3000 J/L was chosen as the level of irradiation for liquid plasma that is used commercially by a specialized blood plasma producer. The opaqueness of a liquid can limit the penetration of UV-C irradiation and therefore affect the efficiency of pathogen inactivation (Matak et al., 2005; Groenewald et al., 2013). However, if sufficient turbulence is introduced into the liquid, all material is exposed to the surface of the UV source therefore overcoming the limited penetration of the UV irradiation (Alberini et al., 2015). The Sure Pure Turbulator (EP-1255444B1) is designed to create turbulent flow and has been successfully used to pasteurize opaque liquids like fruit juices, wine (Keyser et al., 2008; Fredericks et al., 2011) and milk (Donaghy et al., 2009). In addition, in case of animal plasma, a UV dose of 3000 J/L has been demonstrated to have no effect on the functionality of proteins present in SDPP (Polo et al., 2015; Cottingim et al., 2017).",
