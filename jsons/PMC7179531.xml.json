Data extraction for each study was done according to a standardized form designed by us to capture and record all relevant information required for analysis. For each study, 2 reviewers extracted the data independently, cross-checked with each other and resolved disagreements through discussion. For all included studies, the following information was recorded: author, year of publication, country, number of patients, number of respiratory virus species detected, viral detection method, specimen collected for viral detection, number of patients with viral infections and number of patients with mixed infections by viruses and other pathogens.",

Statistical heterogeneity was tested with Cochran's \u03c72 and quantified with the I2 statistic (30-60% for moderate heterogeneity; 50-90% for substantial heterogeneity; 75-100% for considerable heterogeneity) [10]. In order to reduce the heterogeneity across studies and perform further analysis, a subgroup analysis was required. We further investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by metaregression analysis. Factors examined individually in univariable models were the sample type used for viral detection (by comparing a lower respiratory tract specimen with an upper respiratory tract specimen), time span of patient enrollment, geographical region, number of viral species detected and number of viral detection methods. We did all analyses in Stata (version 12.1, StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex., USA) with the commands \u2018metan\u2019 (for random-effects meta-analysis), \u2018metareg\u2019 (for metaregression) and \u2018metainf\u2019 (for sensitivity analysis).",

The quality score of those 23 reports is listed in table 1. Ten of the 23 reports achieved a score \u22657, and the other 13 reports scored between 4 and 6. Of the 23 reports, 2 were conducted in adult outpatients with CAP [11, 12], 17 in adult inpatients with CAP [7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and 4 in both outpatients and inpatients with CAP [29, 30, 31, 32].

The random-effects combined incidence was 22.4% (95% CI = 19.0-25.7, I2 = 91.8%). Considering the high level of heterogeneity, we further conducted a subgroup analysis for the separate calculation of combined incidences according to the types of patients (inpatients, outpatients and mixed patients), time span of patient enrollment (1 year vs. >1 year), economic level of the countries (developed vs. developing countries), PCR methods (routine PCR vs. real-time PCR) or according to the region where each report was conducted (Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, America and the Middle East), as shown in table 2. The combined incidence of respiratory viruses was 10.2% (95% CI = 7.3-13.1, I2 = 0%) in outpatients [11, 12], 22.7% (95% = 19.0-26.4, I2 = 90.8%) in inpatients [7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32] and 27.7% (95% = 16.4-39.0, I2 = 94.7%) in mixed patients [29, 30]. In the subgroup analysis according to regions, the combined incidence was highest in the Middle East (32%, 95% CI = 27-38, I2 = 0%) [21, 23] and lowest in Southeast Asia (16.6%, 95% CI = 10.5-22.8, I2 = 85.1%) [11, 12, 15, 19, 32]. The combined incidence was 24.3% (95% CI = 20.3-28.3, I2 = 92.7%) and 15.8% (95% CI = 10.4-21.3, I2 = 84.2%) in developed countries and developing countries, respectively. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the time span of the studies, the combined incidence of respiratory viruses in the studies covering 1 year and >1 year was 23.6% (95% CI = 22.1-25.1, I2 = 92.6%) and 24.3% (95% CI = 22.5-26.2, I2 = 96.9%), respectively. In addition, considering that real-time PCR is more sensitive than routine PCR, which might lead to the significant heterogeneity in our study, we further performed a subgroup analysis stratified by PCR methods (routine PCR vs. real-time PCR). The combined incidence of respiratory viruses was 20.9% (95% CI = 17.1-24.6, I2 = 89.2%) in studies using routine PCR and 24.7% (95% CI = 18.1-31.3, I2 = 94.3%) in studies using real-time PCR.",

Additionally, we did a sensitivity analysis and found that the study by Cilloniz et al. [20] might have contributed to the heterogeneity. However, the recombined incidence of respiratory viruses after omission of that study was 23.0% (95% CI = 19.7-26.3, I2 = 90.5%), which was similar to the combined incidence before omission.",

As shown in figure 3, the incidence estimates of coinfections ranged from 3 to 28%; heterogeneity was considerable (\u03c72 = 200.9, p < 0.0001, I2 = 91.5%). The combined overall incidence of coinfections of respiratory viruses with other pathogens (mainly bacteria) was 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0, I2 = 91.5%). Due to the high level of heterogeneity, the subgroup analysis was performed according to the patient types, economic level of the countries and regions where the studies were performed, as mentioned above.

Since only 1 study provided the incidence of coinfections in outpatients with CAP [12], a combined estimate was not performed. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the time span of the studies, the combined incidence of respiratory viruses in the studies covering 1 year and >1 year was 12.5% (95% CI = 9.2-15.7, I2 = 91.3%) and 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0, I2 = 94.1%), respectively.

At present, there is a lack of quantitative syntheses of studies regarding the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP worldwide. Our main finding is that respiratory viruses contribute to approximately 1/5 infections in adult patients presenting with CAP, highlighting their role in the pathogenesis of CAP. Furthermore, the influenza virus is the most frequent respiratory viral etiology in adult patients with CAP.",

Moreover, the combined incidence of viral infections mixed with other pathogens (mainly bacteria) is 12% in our study, constituting more than half of the total viral infections in adult patients with CAP. Evidence from several studies illustrated that viral infections made hosts susceptible to secondary bacterial infections because mucosal barriers in the respiratory tracts were impaired during previous viral infections [33, 34], which led to the bacterial invasions becoming more facile. There is evidence as well, although sparse, suggesting that mixed viral-bacterial infections would generate a severer inflammatory status and clinical presentation than individual bacterial or viral infections [24, 26, 35]. Severe fatal pneumonia can be caused by concomitant infection with the influenza virus and Staphylococcus aureus in both children and adults [36, 37, 38]. Moreover, in 1 pneumonia study focused on adults, rhinovirus-pneumococcal coinfections correlated with severe pneumonia and raised mortality [24, 26, 35]. Therefore, our results would be helpful for clinicians to better recognize the burden of viral infections and mixed viral-bacterial infections on adult patients presenting with CAP.",

Influenza vaccination has been previously proven to be efficient in preventing influenza viral infections especially during a pandemic influenza period [43]. Furthermore, several studies which enrolled patients with a chronic lung disease indicated that an influenza vaccination significantly reduced the incidence of pneumonia or acute exacerbations in those patients [44]. Therefore, a regular and routine influenza vaccination of patients with chronic lung disease would be needed to lower the burden of pneumonia caused by the influenza virus. Moreover, newly developed anti-influenza virus drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir), which have established roles in the early treatment of influenza infections through reducing the median time to the resolution of the symptoms and the risk of pneumonia [45], provided an efficient weapon for clinicians to manage patients with viral pneumonia caused by the influenza virus.",

However, conventional virological diagnostic techniques such as serology, immunofluorescence and culture have been underestimating the contribution of viruses to the pathogenesis of CAP [46, 47], especially in adult patients, due to their low sensitivity and narrow application. Owing to the development of more rapid and sensitive detection methods (PCR and real-time PCR), the viral diagnosis is largely improved, particularly through the combined application of these methods with conventional detection techniques [7]. Lots of previous studies evaluating the role of respiratory viruses in adult patients with CAP have been reported; nevertheless, there are discrepancies in the detection methods used for viral diagnosis across those studies. Therefore, we only included studies applying sensitive detection techniques (PCR and real-time PCR) for viral diagnosis in our further meta-analysis to reduce possible heterogeneity along with obtaining quantitative syntheses of original data.",

Our following heterogeneity analyses generated 1 potentially important finding, namely that lower respiratory tract specimens were associated with higher overall viral incidence. This may be because the molecular detection of the virus in lower respiratory tract specimens was more sensitive than the one in upper respiratory tract specimens. The potential implication of this result is that the presence of viral nucleic acids, detected by PCR of lower respiratory tract samples, implies stronger evidence of the infection by virus. However, no relation was identified between the incidence of coinfection and the lower respiratory tract specimens, which might be explainable. As we could speculate, discrepancies of both bacterial diagnostic and viral detection would lead to a significant heterogeneity of the incidence of coinfection. Caution is necessary when combined incidence estimates are used due to the significant heterogeneity, and further surveys are required for the standardization of the specimen collection, specimen quality, PCR primers and PCR reaction conditions during respiratory viral etiology diagnosis.",
