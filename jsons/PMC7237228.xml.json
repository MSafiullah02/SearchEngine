            "text": "Dr. Takuo Aoyagi, a Japanese Bioengineer, whose pioneering work in 1974 led to the invention of modern first commercially available pulse oximeter, a life-saving device that clips on a finger and shows the level of oxygen in blood, died on April 18, 2020, at Tokyo, at the age of 84. Hanning and Alexander William described the monitoring of the oxygen saturation as the \u201cthe greatest advance in patient monitoring since echocardiography\u201d [1]. Introduction of pulse oximetry coincided with a 90% reduction in anesthesia-related fatalities. According to Dr. V Courtney Broaddus, Professor Emeritus of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, apart from the 4 vital signs\u2014temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate, pulse oximeter has become the \u201cfifth\u201d vital sign for oxygen saturation monitoring. The discovery of pulse oximeter by Takuo Aoyagi culminated a century of efforts to prevent the 1885 euphoric high-altitude hypoxic death of Zenith balloonists and fighter pilots in World War 1. In an essay about Dr. Aayogi, John W Severinghaus, Professor Emeritus of Anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco commented in 2007 that Dr. Aayogi \u2018s \u201cdream\u201d has been to detect oxygen saturation levels without having to draw blood.",

The inspiration behind Takuo Aayogi\u2019s discovery in his own words was \u201cI read a report on an interview with Dr Yashio Ogino, Founder of Nihon Kohden Corporation in a newspaper.

He concluded that the variation of the tissue arterial blood volume may be useful for obtaining a signal depending only on pulse characteristics of arterial blood, which may be used for measuring arterial oxygen saturation [2]. While many companies sell oximeter today, \u201call of today\u2019s oximeter are based on Mr. Aoyagi \u2018s original principles of pulse oximetry\u201d according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which awarded Dr. Aoyagi its IEEE medal for innovation in health care technology in 2015. He was the first Japanese person to receive the award and IEEE declared that his research had led to \u201ca fortyfold reduction in death rates in anesthesia.\u201d Nihon Kohden applied for a Japanese patent for its pulse oximeter in 1974 and it was granted in 1979. Aoyagi was awarded with the 2013 Gravenstein award from the Society of Technology in Anesthesia. The University of Tokyo gave Aoyagi a doctorate in Engineering in 1993. In 2002, he received a Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan, given in recognition of achievements in the arts and academics.",

Severinghaus concluded that Takuo Aoyagi\u2019s invention was serendipitous [3]. Unfortunately, the business Dr. Aoyagi worked for did not recognize the potential of his invention and other companies eventually produced the pulse oximeter. By then, however, Dr. Aoyagi had been transferred to another project. The concept behind pulse oximetry had been \u201cdenied\u201d by a skeptical supervisor at Nihon Kohden, Dr. Aoyagi recalled, and he was kept from working on the device until 1985. Competitors such as Minolta had made refinements that helped make the pulse oximeter popular. Without their work, he wrote in a personal essay, \u201cthe idea might be buried.\u201d In 2007, World Health Organization included pulse oximetry as an essential component of its surgical safety checklist for reducing complications. The Chairman of Board, Nihon Kohden Corporation Kazuo Ogino finally concluded \u201cDr Aoyagi invented one of the most important technologies for patient safety.\u201d The role of pulse oximeter in the current coronavirus pandemic has been undoubtedly on the top. \u201cGreatness in science often, as here, comes from the well-prepared mind turning a chance observation into a major discovery,\u201d Severinghaus wrote about Aoyagi. In his obituary, Nihon Kohden Corporation present President H. Ogino mentions \u201cThe invention of the pulse oximeter is a feat that will go down in the history of the world.\u201d",
