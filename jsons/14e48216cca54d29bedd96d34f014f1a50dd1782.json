A daunting situation is unfolding within Venezuela, which deserves immediate international attention. Almost 2 years ago, after the collapse of health-care services and multiple concurrent re-emerging diseases outbreaks, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the ongoing recommendation that travellers should avoid all non-essential travel to Venezuela. 2 The arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is therefore a major challenge for the country's already fragile systems.",

Estimates from the National Survey of Venezuelan Hospitals 4 and the non-governmental Venezuelan Defence for Epidemiology Network 1 place the number of critical care beds at approximately 720 nationwide.",
