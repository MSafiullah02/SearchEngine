Besides, increasing pneumonias associated with stroke are admitted to the study hospital, which is the largest comprehensive hospital in Henan. Patients from the local and surrounding five provinces will stay in our hospital, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of patients of pneumonias associated with stroke. However, the current situation of severe patients in respiratory medicine includes the particularity of the disease, insufficient cooperation of professional teams, and poor management cohesion. The final result is that patients have to stay in hospital for a long time and have a high rate of reexamination. High mortality rate, high average hospitalization cost and low satisfaction of patients\u2019 family members need comprehensive management model to improve treatment efficiency and quality.",

This integrated management model addressed three essential problems. First, this intervention could shorten the hospitalization stay, which eased the pressure of hospital and doctor. Besides, for the family of patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, the economic burden was decreased. Finally, what should be highlighted in this study was that the integrated management model could improve the treatment effect of patients with severe SAP, which provided a more feasible method to more patients with severe SAP.",

Medical and nursing staff possess extraordinary professionalism. Furthermore, adequate source of patients could be obtained. The management model was easy to be accepted by stakeholders and had a high retention rate: the national health insurance policy had been significantly improved, the reasonable diagnosis of patients was guaranteed by important policy documents in the hospital, the cooperation of relevant departments and the compliance of patients is good. In addition, by consulting the cost of some patients and estimating the number of days in hospital, the average cost of hospitalization of patients after intervention is lower than that of non-intervention group.",

Furthermore, the integrated management model would require that each patient is managed by the same physician-in-charge, in order to ensure the continuity of the patient\u2019s treatment and help improve the satisfaction rate. Finally, if a professional respiratory treatment team is established, which is consisted of senior respiratory physicians and several respiratory rehabilitation technicians, it can provide more evidence about how the treatment effect of integrated management model could be maintained or raised in the long term. It is worth noting that these staff receive experience unified training. They participate in the whole process of the critical respiratory support, sub-critical pulmonary early rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation in the rehabilitation wards. Through the above-mentioned measures, the smooth implementation of the integrated model could be ensured.",

Pulmonary ventilation and/or ventilation function is decreased in patients with severe SAP. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen was lower than the normal range, with or without an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide. These suggested that these patients had respiratory dysfunction, which showed the importance of rehabilitation in decreasing mortality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay [16]. Hence, this should be assessed and intervened with pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as possible [17]. Pulmonary rehabilitation [18], especially early intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, is an important link in the respiratory management of patients. For critical patients with mechanical ventilation [19, 20], patients with inadequate nutritional support [21], or patients with myasthenia induced by hormones and other drugs [22, 23] as the use of a home ventilator increases, patients with long-term ventilator support and some patients with long-term ventilator support caused by difficult weaning have significant surrounding skeletal muscle atrophy [24, 25]. Hence, intensive pulmonary rehabilitation is helpful in improving their condition and shortening the weaning process.",
