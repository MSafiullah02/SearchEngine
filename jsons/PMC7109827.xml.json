For what appeared initially as a mere infection of the respiratory tract like a common cold, the death toll was alarming, and many lives of health-care workers were claimed. With vigilant public health controls and strict preventive measures on further spread within the hospital environment, the epidemic was brought under control. The concern over this global outbreak brought together scientists from all over the world, and with their joint effort, the SARS virus, a novel coronavirus, was isolated, and subsequently the full genomic sequences of the SARS virus were determined [2\u20134]. Although a lot had been learned about the epidemiology, mode of spread, and certain aspects of the pathogenesis, a number of SARS-related complications are still waiting to be studied.",

In addition, other organs were also infected and damaged by the SARS virus. The targets included the lymphocytes, the epithelium of the distal tubules of the kidney, and the submucosal lymphoid complex of the gut, the spleen, and the lymph nodes [7, 8]. However, only sporadic information is available regarding the involvement of reproductive organs in SARS patients [9, 10]. Because it is known that viruses such as HIV, HBV, and mumps can enter the testis and cause viral orchitis and, in some instances, result in male infertility and testicular tumor [11], we investigated the possible damage of the testis in SARS patients and the effects of SARS on spermatogenesis.",

Spermatogenesis dysfunction in male AIDS patients is invariably reported. The major changes include germ cell depletion, presence of Sertoli cell-only pattern, interstitial inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, peritubular fibrosis associated with tubular hyalinization, and thickening of the tubular wall [19\u201321]. Orchitis caused by mumps virus mainly develops in adult patients [22]. The virus attacks the testis directly, destroying the testicular parenchyma, causing degeneration of germ cells, exudation of leukocytes, and deposition of collagen [23, 24]. Apart from HIV and mumps virus, other viruses, such as Hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and Papilloma virus, were also reported to cause viral orchitis [9]. SARS is a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. We report here that the SARS virus causes orchitis.",

Persistent high fever leads to changes in testicular temperature, contributing to germ cell degeneration and destruction. Previous studies reported that high temperature resulted in meiotic germ cell apoptosis [25]. High fever was also thought to play an important role in mumps orchitis [26]. High fever in SARS might have an indirect effect on testicular dysfunction. However, temperature might not be the only reason. In the control group, there was a case (C03) with lasting high fever, and this testis demonstrated mild fibrosis and congestion with no obvious germ cell loss or leukocyte infiltration. In addition, the treatment of SARS with steroids could also have affected spermatogenesis. Glucocorticoid had been used in five cases (except S05) and it had been reported to induce rat Leydig cell apoptosis [27]. In this study, we did not find an obvious increase of apoptotic Leydig cell in the six SARS cases (P > 0.05 compared with control). Instead, we found mild Leydig cell hyperplasia in some cases. The testis of case S05, who did not take steroids, also displayed changes of orchitis, as did another five SARS cases. Glucocorticoid should not induce leukocyte infiltration and is routinely used to treat orchitis to suppress inflammation. This indicates that steroid treatment might not be the cause for orchitis in SARS, at least not for case S05.",

These findings suggest that viruses might act indirectly via changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis.

We investigated the possibility of direct SARS virus infection in the testis in all six cases by using the ISH method. None showed positive staining. Conflicting reports exist concerning direct infection of testes by the SARS virus. In the study of Zhao et al. [9], it was reported that SARS coronaviruses were detected in testicular epithelial cells and Leydig cells by electron microscopy combined with ISH. However, in another study by Ding et al. [10], testis was negative for the SARS virus, and infections of the heart, the spleen, and the lymph nodes were not established either, yet the spleen and the lymph nodes were reported as being main targets by other groups [7]. Hence, it appears that the SARS virus can infect and damage multiple organs, but direct infection of the testis could not be ascertained at this time.",

These cells could affect the function of Leydig cells and then production of testosterone, damage the blood-testis barrier, and destroy the seminiferous epithelium directly. More important, these cells and their products, inflammatory cytokines, may activate the autoimmune response and autoantibody development within the tubules. Previous studies demonstrated the deposits of IgG in germinal epithelium, the basement membrane, interstitium, vascular endothelium, and degenerated germ cells in experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) [35, 36], and it was reported that serum IgG was increased in SARS patients [37]. In our study, we observed extensive IgG precipitation in the seminiferous epithelium, including in some degenerated germ cells and Sertoli cells.

Although the number of cases in this study is limited, the data indicate that SARS infection affected the testes significantly. Like orchitis associated with HIV, mumps, and HBV, several possible mechanisms may be involved in causing testicular damages in SARS patients. Virus does not only cause orchitis, but also leads to sterility and increased incidence of testicular tumor [15\u201317]. This is particularly important for SARS patients, as most of them are males in the age range of 20\u201350 yr. Therefore, SARS orchitis should be a significant concern when evaluating the prognosis of SARS.
