Today that number is estimated at 8\u00b72 million.3 AIDS is a preventable disease. The survey finds an absence of alarm in the business sector which, if true, bodes poorly for success in controlling this epidemic.",

The urgency of robust public-private partnering is clear in the Asia-Pacific region, where the threat of new human infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, challenge systems that have not received adequate investment to scale-up to successfully meet these new threats. The economics of intervention by the private sector are not always self-evident. Much depends on the ability of the public sector to induce private firms to act for the common good. Market incentives, such as tax breaks and subsidies, can lower the cost of training and help businesses provide information and education for workers. The reduction in duties and taxes on imports of equipment and reagents could reduce drug costs. The cornerstone of partnership is for each sector to understand the needs and motivations of the other.",
