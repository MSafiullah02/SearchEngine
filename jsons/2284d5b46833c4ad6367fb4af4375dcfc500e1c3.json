This controller was assembled in-house. The oxygen flow rate was manually adjusted to assist in maintaining DO at the required percent of air saturation, and the agitation rate was routinely 65 rpm. Inoculum was prepared from 250 mL spinner flasks. The pH was controlled to above 6.3 by carbon dioxide. Base was not used to maintain pH, thus there was no change in osmolarity. For continuous culture, a glassblown-jacketed spinner flask was constructed and was quite successful as a low-volume cell-growth bioreactor. Temperature was maintained at 28\u00b0C using a circulating water bath (VWR). The top was covered by a rubber stopper (No. 10) drilled with seven holes for stirring, media inlet and outlet, gas flow, sampling, level control, and vent. The agitation system was comprised of a glass rod and stir bar, driven by a magnetic stirrer (Bellco, NJ).

IBDV is a member of the Birnaviridae family whose genome consists of two segments of double-stranded RNA. Presently, the principle method of controlling IBDV infection in young chickens is by vaccination with an avirulent strain of IBDV or by the transfer of high levels of maternal antibody to breeder hens.* Recently, virulent strains that are antigentically different from previously established IBDVs have been isolated from vaccinated flocks on the Delmarva peninsula.

Although the baculovirus expression system has proven quite successful for use in laboratories, its use as an industrial expression system has yet to occur, although products for human use are in clinical trials. Briefly, the system entails replacing the gene for the AcNPV coat protein, polyhedrin, with the gene for the protein of interest. This coat protein is not required for the replication and maintenance of the virus in cell culture due to its biphasic life cycle. About three days after infection with a recombinant virus, the protein of interest is expressed instead of polyhedrin, which would normally constitute the majority of the total cellular protein. The system is attractive because it is nonpathogenic towards humans, and it involves the in virro propagation of cells for which technology has advanced due to previous mammalian and hybridoma culturing techniques. It provides for an abundant supply of the protein of interest in part due to the strong polyhedrin promoter and also because insect cell lines reported to date provide for glycosylation and other posttranslational processing. In addition, the construction of recombinant baculoviruses has become simplified due to commercial expression kits. Several general articles, manuals, and review articles have been published that describe both the expression system'\" and novel process engineering aspects.%\" In this work, we subdivide the entire bioprocess into three key areas: (1) metabolism of infected cells and specific heterologous protein yield; (2) bioreactor configuration and high cell density continuous culture; and (3) integration of expression and product separation. In each of the RESULTS subsections, we briefly review the recent literature as well as present our efforts to understand and advance these areas.",

            "text": "Hundreds of laboratories have expressed heterologous proteins using recombinant AcNPV and Sf-9 or Bm-5 cell lines, yet only several laboratories have focused attention on maximizing yield by examining cellular functions during the growth and expression phases. Factors such as MOI, timing of infection, and cell density have been well documented. For example, Neutra et al. l 2 examined the effects of reactor volume, infection timing, MOI, and cell density on P-galactosidase production in shake flasks. King et al. 13 found that low MOI was favorable for a temperaturesensitive baculovirus. Conversely, for a more typical baculovirus with polyhedrin promoter control and an rCD4 product, Lazarte et aLt4 found high MOI was most favorable. Perhaps these systems differed by changes in cell metabolism that resulted from medium condition and infection temperature. In the Lazarte et a1.I4 study, fresh medium added at infection tripled the yield. Indeed, several groups have demonstrated that infected cells retain significant metabolic activity, and this is essential for producing the recombinant protein. Caron et al. noted that postinfection cell physiology was critical and suggested that different growth and production medias might be required. Zhang et a1. 16 noted that for Bm-5 cells, serum concentrations for optimal growth were different than for viral production. Additionally, Kamen et al. \"quantified differences in principal nutrients and waste products during the growth and production phases.",

Likewise, Scott et a1.2\" reported a significant increase in protein yield by maintaining dissolved oxygen tension at 50% of saturation. However, at high cell densities, maintaining oxygen was not sufficient for increasing yield.

Virus infection was performed for the fermentor without DO control by adding 15 mL virus solution (MOI 5) at 91 hours, after the cells had attained a concentration of 6.15 x lo5 cells/mL. This MOI and cell density were chosen so that other factors, such as nutrient depletion, were eliminated and differences due to oxygen level were discernible. Shortly after infection, the DO dropped to zero and remained zero for another 90 hours. The viable cell concentration remained near 6.55 x l@ cells/mL and then started to decrease simultaneously with an increase in DO after 190 hours (FIG. 3a) . The onset of cell lysis, however, is marked by both the increment in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and decrement in cell viability near 150 hours (FIG. 3b) .

The increased demand in oxygen immediately following infection was met in this experiment, and the DO was maintained above 10% and averaged 35% for the remainder of the experiment. The continuous addition of oxygen likely provided the requirement for continued cell growth.

The epoxide hydrolase activity reached 0.044 U/mL, which was 200% higher than in the oxygen-uncontrolled experiment. The specific productivity increased by 100% as well. This increase in protein synthesis is accomplished only by continued glucose uptake after infection. In the uncontrolled experiment, infected cells consumed little glucose (-1 mM) after the DO dropped to zero.

We have used azocasein to investigate the appearance of alkaline proteases that may breakdown the product, particularly if allowed to follow in the separation and purification processes. 29 In another fermentor experiment, we controlled the dissolved oxygen to 50% and infected cells (MOI 5) by the addition of virus stock solution when the cell density was about 1 . 2~1 0~ cells/mL. This lower cell density was chosen in order to avoid other cellular stress effects (for example, nutrient starvation). The cells (FIG. 6) kept growing after viral infection due to a low MO121-30 for a period of 40 hours and then the viable cell density decreased later due to a secondary infection. The total cell density decreased due to cell lysis, and the viability was 20% at cell harvest. Two recombinant protein activities and the total specific protease activity are also shown. In this system, P-galactosidase expression is under promoter P10 control; epoxide hydrolase (EH) is our desired recombinant product and is under the polyhedrin promoter control. 0-galactosidase is a cytoplasmic protein and will be liberated to the medium during expression and lysis. However, EH is membrane bound and not released to the medium. Expression of both proteins (FIG. 6) started simultaneously. The P-galactosidase activity increased until 79 hpi, was constant for a short time, and then decreased by 12% until harvest. On the other hand, EH increased more slowly initially, remained constant for 20 hours and increased slowly by 20% until harvest. The specific protease activity was shown to increase dramatically starting at about 70 hpi. This time just corresponds to the reduction of P-galactosidase activity and the slowdown in EH production. We should note that the viability was near 70% at this moment. Inasmuch as the viability was high and.there was no nutrient limitation (not shown), there was no apparent reason for cells to stop producing recombinant protein. The protease (measured as specific activity in the cell pellet) increased at least 15-fold even when considering partial loss from cell lysis. We also measured proteolytic activity in supernatant, and no increment was found, which suggests that the proteolytic activity was either associated with the cell membrane or was too dilute to detect in the supernatant. Although there is no specific connection between the protease activity and the shift in protein activities (P-gal, EH), the coincident timing warrants further consideration. Because it is unlikely that protease inhibitors will be used in a commercial process, the specific nature and timing of this proteolytic activity is significant. Hence, characterization of the identity and consequences of this and other proteases is under investigation.",
