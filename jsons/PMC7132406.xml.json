AOM management generally involves adequate analgesics with an optional observation period for 48\u201372 h [5]. Thereafter, antibiotic treatment or, in the case of recurrent infections, antibiotic prophylaxis or ventilation tube insertion are considered [5], [8], [9]. In contrast, for OME disease, medical intervention is appropriate only if persistent clinical benefits can be achieved in the absence of spontaneous resolution. Therefore, healthy children with OME are observed for at least 3 months before medical intervention is considered, in which case surgical treatment involving the insertion of ventilation tubes or adenoidectomy is feasible [3], [10]. Vaccination against OM diseases is currently very limited, being directed against very few bacterial OM pathogens, and only one of the viral OM pathogens, i.e. the influenza vaccine. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is primarily directed against pneumococcal invasive disease, whereas the introduction of vaccination only reduced the overall OM incidence by 6\u20139% due to serotype or pathogen replacement [11]. However, herd immunity may induce a further decline in OM incidence, in line with nasopharyngeal colonization studies 3 years after the introduction of the vaccine [12], [13].",

Colonization of the nasopharynx with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis (the three most important bacterial pathogens associated with OM disease) at an early stage, has been shown to predispose children for development of rAOM [14]. In addition, OM-prone children have increased carriage rates of these bacterial pathogens compared to healthy controls [15], [16]. In AOM, S. pneumoniae is the most frequently detected pathogen in middle ear fluid, followed by non-typeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis\n[17], [18], [19]. However, H. influenzae tends to predominate in COME, followed in a lesser extent by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis\n[20]. In general, bacteria have been found less frequently in the middle ear of children suffering from COME compared to AOM (approximately 30% versus 70%, respectively) [17].",

Recurrent AOM was defined as 3 or more episodes of AOM in the last 6 months or 4 episodes in the last 12 months [28]. The COME patient population consisted of children who had experienced a period of persistent OM with effusion lasting longer than 3 months. RAOM or COME diagnosis was made by an otolaryngologist in routine clinical practice based upon signs, symptoms, otoscopy and audiometry including tympanometry. Patients with a history of malignancy, organ transplantation or immune deficiency were excluded from participation, as well as patients with recent elective ear surgery or systemic infectious diseases. Children with AOM and/or fever (T\n \u2265 38 \u00b0C) at the time of ventilation tube insertion were rescheduled for the procedure. Adenoidectomy performed in the same surgical setting was not considered to be an exclusion criterion. Patient characteristics and risk factors were acquired using a questionnaire, collected at the day of ventilation tube insertion.

Importantly, the bacterial pathogens that were detected in the middle ear fluids of our cohorts tended to be genetically identical (using MLST) to those isolates cultured from the nasopharynx (80\u2013100%), a finding that correlates with previously published data. Studies investigating the genetic relatedness of bacteria obtained from different locations of the upper respiratory tract, and within a single patient are scarce. Various approaches to determine the genetic relatedness of nasopharyngeal and OM isolates have been described, however MLST was only used once, a technique that is considered to be the gold standard regarding bacterial genotyping [42], [43], [44].",

Co-infection of rhinovirus and enterovirus was found in the middle ear, but not in the nasopharynx. Co-occurrence of these viruses has been previously described by Rezes et al., who found rhinovirus in middle ear fluid in 4.8% of the 17 children, enterovirus in 23.8% and both rhino- and enterovirus in 14.3% [46]. Nevertheless, in our study the co-occurrence of multiple viruses in middle ear fluid or in the nasopharynx was rare. In the nasopharynx of our OM patients we found a single virus in 46% and 2 viruses in 9%, in contrast to healthy children as described by Bogaert et al. [47]. They found two or more viruses in the majority of the virus positive nasopharyngeal samples, in 96 children up to two years of age [47]. In our cohort only 15% of the children under the age of 2 had maximal two viruses in the nasopharynx. This finding suggests that in symptomatic children suffering from OM one virus is predominant in the nasopharynx, whereas in healthy children more viruses can be present without clinical significance.",

Influenza A and S. pneumoniae, RSV and H. influenzae are two examples of viral-bacterial interaction investigated in both animal models and human studies [50]. To our knowledge this is the first report describing a highly significant association for the co-occurrence of bacteria and virus in the nasopharynx of rAOM and COME patients. More specifically, nasopharyngeal co-colonization of rhinoviruses with either S. pneumoniae, or H. influenzae, was statistically significant. Pitkaranta et al. observed a positive correlation between the presence of S. pneumoniae or M. catarrhalis and rhinovirus in the nasopharynx, but not of H. influenzae and rhinovirus [45]. However, the authors focused on nasopharyngeal samples of OM-prone children, and exclusion criteria for their study were either recent or expected ventilation tube insertion and COME diagnosis [45]. In the present study, no association between the co-occurrence of these viruses and bacteria was observed in middle ear fluids for both rAOM and COME cohorts, likely caused by the relatively low number of bacteria detected in middle ear fluid. In addition, since viruses can predispose to bacterial super-infection, it is possible that they are already cleared from the middle ear cavity at the time of surgery.",
