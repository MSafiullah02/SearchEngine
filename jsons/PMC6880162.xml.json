MERS-CoV continues to infect humans in the Middle East, and four additional human CoVs (HCoVs), HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, continue to circulate globally and cause respiratory disease (3\u20136). The continued circulation in bat populations of SARS- and MERS- like CoVs that can replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells further demonstrates the potential for CoVs to emerge and cause severe disease in the future (7\u201310). While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks have been controlled, largely through public health measures (11\u201313), the potential for future outbreaks highlights the need for safe and effective therapeutics to combat CoV infections. There are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccines for any human CoV infection. Previous efforts to treat CoV infections with existing antivirals did not conclusively benefit clinical outcomes; thus, the current standard of care remains mostly supportive (14\u201316).",

            "text": "Several targets for direct-acting antivirals are being investigated to treat CoV infections (17\u201319). Because the viral replication machinery performs an essential role in genome replication, therapeutics approved to treat multiple different viral infections are aimed at this target (20). Many approved antivirals are classified as nucleoside analogues, compounds that mimic natural nucleosides to inhibit viral replication (21). Inhibition by nucleoside analogues can be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms. Common mechanisms of action include incorporation of the analogue by the viral polymerase to induce premature termination of strand synthesis and loss of essential genetic information through mutagenesis (22\u201325). A previous study reported that the nucleoside analogues ribavirin (RBV) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) did not potently inhibit CoVs, and this finding was attributed to the proofreading capabilities of the viral 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) (26). Recent reports have demonstrated the inhibition of wild-type (WT) CoVs by nucleoside analogues such as galidesivir (BCX4430) and remdesivir (GS-5734) (27\u201329). While these compounds have shown efficacy against CoVs, administration of multiple compounds simultaneously may be required to effectively treat CoV infections and control the emergence of drug resistance, as has been demonstrated for other viral infections (30).",

NHC treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in viral titers for MHV (Fig. 2A) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2B). This inhibition resulted in 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 0.17 \u03bcM for MHV (Fig. 2C) and 0.56 \u03bcM for MERS-CoV (Fig. 2D). We detected negligible changes in DBT-9 cell viability out to 200 \u03bcM (Fig. 2E) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values above 10 \u03bcM in Vero cells (Fig. 2F). The antiviral activity was not due to cytotoxicity, as the selectivity indexes were >1,000 for MHV and >20 for MERS-CoV. Together, these results confirm potent inhibition of \u03b2-CoVs by NHC.",

We added 16 \u03bcM (\u223c100 times the EC50) NHC at the indicated times pre- or postinfection (p.i.) of cells with WT MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell and quantified viral replication after a single infectious cycle. Compared to the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) control, NHC significantly inhibited MHV replication when added at or before 6 h postinfection (Fig. 3A), suggesting that NHC acts at early stages of the viral replication cycle. We next determined the effect of NHC on MHV RNA levels and compared it to the effect on the infectious-virus titer. RNA levels were reduced by approximately 10-fold at the highest tested concentration of NHC in both MHV-infected cell monolayers (Fig. 3B) and supernatants (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the viral titer was reduced up to 5,000-fold at this concentration. We therefore calculated the ratio of infectious virus per viral RNA genome copy number normalized to the untreated control (specific infectivity) after NHC treatment and found that the specific infectivity of WT MHV was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with increasing concentrations of NHC (Fig. 3D). Together, these data are consistent with a mutagenic mechanism of NHC anti-CoV activity.",

Our data demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mutations present at low frequencies (<5% of the viral population) across the genome after treatment with increasing concentrations of NHC (Fig. 4A to C). Further analysis of the types of mutations introduced by NHC revealed an increase in the total number of transition mutations with increasing NHC concentrations (Fig. 4D to F). The relative proportions of G:A and C:U transitions among all observed mutations were increased by 13 to 15% in the presence of 2 \u03bcM NHC and 36 to 40% in the presence of 4 \u03bcM NHC compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 4G and H). Conversely, the relative proportions of A:G and U:C transitions decreased with increasing NHC concentrations compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 4G and H). Together, these results demonstrate that NHC treatment during a single round of WT MHV infection causes predominantly G:A and C:U transition mutations that are detectable at low frequencies across the genome.

Therefore, we tested the sensitivity of ExoN(\u2212) MHV to NHC inhibition. Our results indicate that NHC decreases the titers of both WT and ExoN(\u2212) MHV in a dose-dependent manner but that ExoN(\u2212) MHV demonstrates a statistically significant increase in sensitivity to NHC inhibition compared to WT MHV (Fig. 5A). However, this difference is reflected in only a modest decrease in the EC90 (approximately 2-fold) for ExoN(\u2212) MHV (0.72 \u03bcM) compared to WT MHV (1.59 \u03bcM) (Fig. 5B).

We found that the lineage 1 (MHV p30.1) viral population showed no change in sensitivity to NHC compared to WT MHV (Fig. 6A). However, lineage 2 (MHV p30.2) showed a decrease in sensitivity to NHC inhibition in a titer reduction assay, especially at higher concentrations of compound. We observed a modest (approximately 2-fold) increase in EC90 values for MHV NHC passage viruses (WT MHV, EC90 = 1.53 \u03bcM; MHV p30.1, EC90 = 2.61 \u03bcM; MHV p30.2, EC90 = 2.41 \u03bcM) (Fig. 6B). This suggests that MHV passage resulted in minimal resistance to NHC. We next sought to determine if passaging WT MHV in the presence of NHC altered the replication capacities of these viruses. We found that both lineages showed a delay in replication but ultimately reached peak titers similar to that of WT MHV (Fig. 6C). This delay in replication suggests that MHV p30 is less fit than WT MHV.",

Both lineages passaged in the presence NHC had accumulated over 100 consensus mutations distributed across the genomes (Fig. 6D and E; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). In comparison, a previous study reported that WT MHV accumulated only 23 total mutations after 250 passages in the absence of drug (38). Further analysis of the p30 MHV mutational profile demonstrated that slightly more of the total mutations in both lineages were synonymous changes that did not result in an amino acid change as opposed to nonsynonymous changes, which did alter the amino acid sequence (Fig. 6F; see Table S1). Additionally, the vast majority of mutations in both lineages were transition mutations resulting in a purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine change (Fig. 6G). Both lineages contained only two transversion mutations resulting in a purine-to-pyrimidine or pyrimidine-to-purine change. Though all possible transition mutation types were detected in both viral-lineage populations, the majority in both passage lineages were G:A transitions (Fig. 6H), which is consistent with the MHV NGS data (Fig. 4). To determine if the mutational profile at p30 was consistent with an earlier passage, we analyzed the whole genomes of both lineages 1 and 2 at p19. Both lineages demonstrated fewer mutations at p19 than at p30, but the profiles of synonymous versus nonsynonymous changes and the transition mutations were similar (see Fig. S1 and Table S2 in the supplemental material).",

As with MHV, we passaged two lineages of MERS-CoV 30 times in the presence of increasing concentrations of NHC and tested the sensitivities of the lineages to inhibition by NHC. Compared to WT MERS-CoV passaged in the absence of drug, both MERS-CoV NHC p30.1 and p30.2 exhibited decreased sensitivity to NHC inhibition (Fig. 7A). This correlated with modestly increased EC90 values for the passage lineages (WT MERS-CoV, EC90 = 1.31 \u03bcM; MERS-CoV p30.1, EC90 = 3.04 \u03bcM; MERS-CoV p30.2, EC90 = 2.12 \u03bcM) (Fig. 7B), corresponding to approximately 2-fold resistance. Similar to MHV, we observed no substantial shift in the dose-response curve for MERS-CoV, indicating minimal acquired resistance. NHC p30 viruses replicated similarly to WT p30 MERS-CoV (Fig. 7C). We sequenced both lineages of the MERS-CoV p30 population and detected 27 consensus mutations in MERS-CoV NHC p30.1 (Fig. 7D; see Table S3 in the supplemental material) and 41 consensus mutations in MERS-CoV NHC p30.2 (Fig. 7E; see Table S3) that were randomly distributed across the genome. Both MERS-CoV NHC p30.1 and MERS-CoV NHC p30.2 accumulated nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations in roughly equal proportions (Fig. 7F). As in MHV, the mutations detected in MERS-CoV p30 lineages were predominantly transition mutations (Fig. 7G). Further analysis of these mutations revealed that the predominant type of transition was lineage dependent. The majority of transition mutations in MERS-CoV NHC p30.1 were G:A transitions, as was observed in both p30 MHV lineages, whereas MERS-CoV NHC p30.2 contained similar numbers of each type (Fig. 7H). These results indicate that MERS-CoV can achieve low-level resistance to NHC and that development of resistance is associated with the accumulation of multiple transition mutations. Together, our data suggest NHC acts as a mutagen and that it poses a high genetic barrier to resistance for \u03b2-CoVs.",

More recently, the antiviral properties of the compound have been reported for multiple RNA viruses, including chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, norovirus, influenza A and B viruses, and Ebola virus (31\u201336). NHC has also been shown to potently inhibit SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 (43, 44), suggesting potential utility in treating CoV infections (17). Based on previous studies, NHC appears to primarily inhibit viral replication by mutagenesis (31, 34). Serial passaging in the presence of NHC led to low-level resistance for VEEV, but no detectable resistance for RSV, IAV, or bovine viral diarrhea virus, indicating a high barrier to resistance (31, 34, 36). Consistent with the previous studies, we demonstrated that NHC is mutagenic in CoVs and that serial passaging yields low-level, approximately 2-fold resistance. Low-level resistance has also been observed for remdesivir, another nucleoside analogue that potently inhibits CoVs. Approximately 6-fold resistance to remdesivir is conferred by two mutations in the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (37). This study further expands the known antiviral spectrum of NHC to include MHV and MERS-CoV, two genetically divergent \u03b2-CoVs, and supports NHC development as a broad-spectrum CoV antiviral.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that viruses lacking ExoN proofreading activity [ExoN(\u2212) viruses] are more sensitive to inhibition by nucleoside analogues, especially RBV and 5-FU (26, 37, 38, 45). This increased sensitivity has been attributed to the inability of ExoN(\u2212) viruses to efficiently remove incorrect nucleosides (46). However, we observed a minimal change in NHC sensitivity between WT MHV and ExoN(\u2212) MHV, especially by EC90. This suggests that NHC interacts with the CoV replicase differently than other previously tested nucleoside analogues. One explanation is that NHC may evade removal by the proofreading ExoN. Studies investigating nucleosides that inhibit DNA viruses have suggested an inability of the viral exonuclease to efficiently excise some nucleoside analogues (47, 48). Further, a previous study suggested that the T4 DNA exonuclease activity was incapable of removing NHC (49). While the SARS-CoV ExoN efficiently removes 3\u2032-terminal mismatches regardless of type (46, 50), the effect of NHC on this activity has not been investigated. Interestingly, mismatches readily observed during single-nucleotide elongation by the SARS-CoV polymerase in the absence of drugs correspond to mismatches that would lead to the G:A and C:U transitions observed after NHC treatment (46). This suggests that the CoV polymerase could be naturally more prone to make these types of errors, which are then magnified by NHC. This could lead to a scenario where ExoN cannot prevent dipping below the error threshold, ultimately resulting in lethal mutagenesis and similar inhibition of both WT MHV and ExoN(\u2212) MHV (51).",

Thus, another explanation for the unique potency of NHC in the presence of an active proofreading ExoN is that it may inhibit viral replication by additional mechanisms beyond mutagenesis. Indeed, previous reports have suggested that NHC may also interfere with the RNA secondary structure or virion release to cause inhibition (31, 36). Further, exogenous C or U in the presence of NHC could rescue viral replication in HCV, chikungunya virus, RSV, and influenza A virus (32, 34, 36), indicating that NHC competes with exogenous nucleosides at some stage prior to viral inhibition. These results raise the possibility that NHC could inhibit a process that results in similar inhibition of these viruses by a mechanism unrelated to ExoN. Thus, future studies will be important to investigate the role of proofreading in NHC inhibition of CoVs to shed light on the intricacies of NHC inhibition of the CoV replication complex.",

            "text": "The decrease in specific infectivity, along with the accumulation of transitions across the CoV genome, supports a mutagenic mechanism of action for NHC in CoVs. NHC resistance in CoVs was modest and difficult to achieve, as we obtained approximately 2-fold resistance after 30 passages. Resistance was associated with multiple mutations. Interestingly, MERS-CoV accumulated fewer mutations over 30 passages than MHV. While differences in viral mutation rates could be the driver of this difference, previous studies have suggested that MHV does not have a higher mutation rate than MERS-CoV (54\u201356). The differences in mutation accumulation between MHV and MERS-CoV may be a product of different passage conditions. While MHV was passaged with a consistent transfer volume, MERS-CoV passage volumes were adjusted over time to sustain viral replication under escalating selection for drug resistance. The constant-volume passaging conditions may have more severely bottlenecked MHV populations and fixed more mutations in the genome than the variable-volume passaging conditions applied to MERS-CoV (57). Alternatively, this difference could also reflect a difference in mutational robustness of the MHV and MERS-CoV genomes, though this proposition needs to be investigated further (58, 59). While a portion of the mutations that accumulated during passage likely contribute to NHC resistance, mutations in proteins dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, such as ns2 and nsp2, may be merely tolerated because of their limited effect on viral fitness in the context of our passage conditions (60\u201362). Few common mutations arose in both MHV and MERS-CoV passage series (see Tables S1 to S3), suggesting that multiple pathways to low-level NHC resistance exist in CoVs. Interestingly, for both MHV and MERS-CoV, the p30 lineage that demonstrated a greater change in sensitivity to NHC was the lineage that had fewer overall mutations (Fig. 6 and 7). Both MHV passage lineages replicated less well than WT MHV, suggesting that the accumulation of mutations during passage may negatively impact viral fitness and the ability of MHV to evolve robust resistance to NHC. Further, the MHV lineage that did not result in changed sensitivity to NHC by p30 (MHV p30.1) had fewer mutations present at consensus by p19 than the other lineage (see Fig. S1). Thus, it is possible that the accumulation of deleterious mutations counteracts the potential benefits of resistance mutations (63). If this is the case, mutations promoting NHC resistance would need to arise early during passage to help mitigate the accumulation of excess deleterious mutations. Alternatively, the inability to evade inhibition by NHC may lead to the accumulation of a greater number of NHC-associated transitions and ultimately a higher mutational burden that may impact viral fitness (64, 65). Together, our results support the hypothesis that establishment of resistance to NHC in CoVs requires a delicate balance of resistance-promoting mutations, viral fitness, and accumulation of deleterious mutations. Thus, defining the roles of individual NHC resistance-associated mutations will be an important goal for future studies. Overall, our results support further development of NHC as a broad-spectrum antiviral for treatment of CoV infections and contribute new insights into important aspects of CoV replication.",
