Italy, where a higher number of cases than in any other European country has been described in the first weeks of the epidemic, was different from many other countries in distributing and administering large numbers of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 tests, which were immediately provided free of charge (like all medical treatments and drugs, thanks to the public health system) after the first recognized case, in Lombardy, on February 20. Thus, in reality, the high rate of infection in Italy soon after the identification of the first case only reflected the high local rate of detection of a virus already spread over all Europe. Unfortunately, in several countries, such as Germany, France, UK, and United States, very few tests have been conducted at the beginning of the epidemic, so the real extent was initially missing. In some cases, tests are expensive, and it seems very unlikely testing will ever be free. Coupled with the fact that, in some countries, depending on the circumstances or on the type of job, workers do not have paid sick (or quarantine) leave, it is also likely that people who are asymptomatic or slightly sick, but infectious, will continue to go to work and will infect others. Clearly, this does not help in containing the Covid\u201019 epidemic. Most countries are now coping very heavily with the virus, and evidence has emerged that the virus is circulating within local communities so that border\u2010based travel restrictions are now no longer able to control its unpleasant arrival.",

Similarly, in different parts of the world, a relevant number of scientific and nonscientific meetings are now being canceled. Moreover, several prestigious research centers and universities are prohibiting their members and employees not only from traveling to \u201cdangerous\u201d countries but also from participating in any sort of domestic or international meeting, for 60 days at least.

However, in the last decades, there has been an increased spillover of viruses from natural hosts (like the bat) to intermediate hosts (like market civets and dromedary camels) and then to humans, likely because of human activities, including modern agricultural practices and urbanization. Coronaviruses are broadly distributed in humans and in other mammals, and there are at least seven viruses that have been able to pass from animals to humans, crossing the species barriers and infecting humans 7. Some of them are, however, relatively innocuous and cause the common cold, while those quoted here below are extremely dangerous for human health as they are highly pathogenic, able to be readily transmitted from human to human, and able to spread to multiple continents in a very short time. Thus, to cope with this epidemic, and to substantially contribute to the fight against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we have to learn the lesson derived from two recent outbreaks caused by two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

SARS affected 17 countries and, during an epidemic of a few months, caused 774 deaths of 8,096 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases 9. The second was due to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\u2010CoV that, in 2012, was first described in a man in Saudi Arabia 10. MERS has been found in 27 countries and is still present in many of them because of the continuing introduction from dromedary camels. Until last November 2019, MERS has caused 858 deaths of 2,494 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases 11. The present epidemic due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a much higher number of cases. As of the middle of March, there are over 100,000 confirmed cases all over the world, with over 3,500 deaths (for a continuous update, see https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n12).",

Currently, very limited information is available on the host innate immune status of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients and regard the description of increased total neutrophils, reduced total lymphocytes, and increased serum levels of IL\u20106 and of C\u2010reactive protein, which suggest a strong inflammatory response. This is indeed evidenced by reports detecting abnormally high plasma levels of innate cytokines such as IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101A, and TNF\u03b1 or of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL\u20102, IL\u20107, IL\u201010, G\u2010CSF, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101A, and TNF\u03b1). Furthermore, mortality is higher in patients with elevated levels of IL\u20106 14. The overall picture is similar to what happens during SARS and MERS and underlines the fact that leukocyte alterations and a cytokine storm that initiates a viral sepsis could be important in the pathogenesis of Covid\u201019. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, as of middle of March 2020 no data have been published on the specific cellular immune response to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The first data on changes in lymphocyte populations in patients severely affected by Covid\u201019 indicate a low T cells count, an increase in na\u00efve helper T cells and a decrease in memory helper T cells 15. Thus, the immunopathogenesis of this disease is still largely unknown. However, several groups, including ours, are now investigating different molecular, cellular and immunological aspects. Confirming this previous report 15, Figure 1 shows our most recent data, related to the distribution of different subpopulations of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from four aged patients in the symptomatic phase of the infection.",

Which are the protective factors, and which are the biomarkers that clinicians could use to predict, and eventually modify, the course of the disease? Assuming that the scant, available data are reliable, why do children seem to develop a milder form of Covid\u201019, similar to what was described in the case of SARS? Can the immaturity of the immune system protect against immune\u2010mediated damages that could occur during Covid\u201019? Which assays are useful to monitor the efficacy of an antiviral therapy?
