Only GI, GII, and GIV NoVs infect humans, with GII strains being the most prevalent worldwide (Green, 2007). NoVs genetically similar to human NoVs have been recently found in carnivores (Martella et al., 2007, Martella et al., 2008, Pinto et al., 2012, Soma et al., 2014, Summa et al., 2012), raising public health concerns of potential cross-species transmission due to the strict social interactions between humans and pets. Interestingly, significant sequence variation has been found across different canine/feline NoV strains identified to date, allowing the classification of at least 4 genotypes from three distinct genogroups, i.e. GIV.2, GVI.1 and GVI.2 and GVII (Table 1\n).",

Since then, canine NoVs have been reported in several countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia (Azevedo et al., 2012, Mesquita et al., 2010, Mesquita and Nascimento, 2012a, Mesquita and Nascimento, 2012b, Ntafis et al., 2010, Soma et al., 2014, Tse et al., 2012) but the pathogenic role of NoVs in dogs has not been demonstrated firmly. The prevalence of canine NoV in dogs with clinical signs of gastroenteritis has been estimated to vary from 2.1% (Martella et al., 2009) to 40% (Mesquita et al., 2010). A study in the US identified canine NoV at a prevalence of 11% in canine diarrhea samples (Azevedo et al., 2012). Canine NoV has also been detected in healthy dogs (Mesquita et al., 2010), a pattern that is commonly observed in human NoV infections (Ozawa et al., 2007). Serological investigations have confirmed the presence of NoV-specific antibodies in dogs, with various prevalence rates. In a small serological survey in Italy, antibodies to GIV.2 NoV were identified in 5% of the dogs (Di Martino et al., 2010). In a study in UK, antibodies specific for different NoV genotypes were identified in 38.1% of samples collected between 1999 and 2001 and 60.1% of samples collected in 2012\u20132013 (Caddy et al., 2013). A European-wide serological investigation revealed antibodies to GVI.2 NoV in 36% of the analysed dogs (Mesquita et al., 2014).",

Sequence editing and multiple alignments were carried out with the Geneious software package version 9.1.6 (Biomatters Ltd., New Zealand). Genome sequences of NoVs strains were retrieved from GenBank and aligned using Clustal W (Larkin et al., 2007).

In previous molecular investigations canine NoVs have been detected in diarrheic stool samples with a prevalence rate ranging from 2.2% (Martella et al., 2009), to 11.0% (Azevedo et al., 2012) and to 40% (Mesquita et al., 2010). Canine NoVs have also been detected in healthy dogs with a prevalence of 9.0% (Mesquita et al., 2010). Accordingly, the pathogenic role of these viruses in dog enteritis is not firmly established yet. The prevalence rate of 4.4% observed in this study was lower than those reported in the US and Portugal (Azevedo et al., 2012, Mesquita et al., 2010), although different primer sets were used in the various studies. In our investigation, we preferred using broadly reactive primers designed to amplify all the CVs, p289-p290 (Jiang et al., 1999), and subsequently a set of broadly reactive primers able to amplify the majority of NoV strains, JV12Y-JV13I (Vennema et al., 2002). This algorithm, while allowing us to identify genetically diverse NoV strains, was likely less sensitive than other RT-PCR assays based on specific primers. The majority of the NoV-positive samples were identified in the Italian collection of samples (11/239, 4.6%), whilst 2 NoV-positive samples were identified in the Spanish collection (2/26, 7.6%). Mixed infections were identified but they were not unexpected as this eventuality is not infrequent. A limit of our study was surely the non-homogenous size of the sample collections, chiefly the small number of samples analysed for the non-Italian sample collections. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of NoV in dogs in Spain.",

In the full-length VP1 capsid gene (ORF1), two strains (FD53/2007/ITA and 63.15/2015/ITA) were characterized as GVI.2, whilst strain FD210/2007/ITA was characterized as GVI.1. A fourth strain, 5010/2009/ITA, although segregating within genogroup GVI, was more diverse genetically in the VP1 and could not be classified into any established GVI genotypes. According to Zheng's classification (Zheng et al., 2006), the canine NoV strains 63.15/2015/ITA and FD53/2007/ITA were classified together with the canine strain C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and the feline strain TE/77-13/ITA, as a genotype 2 (> 85% pairwise aa identity inter genotypes), within the genogroup GVI (> 55% pairwise aa identity inter-genogroups). The canine strain 5010/2009/ITA was also classified into genogroup GVI, but the aa identity to its closest relatives (the canine GVI.1 strains Bari/91/2007/ITA and FD210/2007/ITA) and the GVI feline strain M49-1/2012/JPN was lower (75.5\u201381.6% aa) than the 85% pairwise aa identity cut-off, proposed to discriminate between different NoV genotypes. Thereby, strain 5010/2009/ITA was tentatively classified as a third genotype (GVI.3) within the genogroup VI. Interestingly, in our analysis the canine GVI.1 strains FD210/2007/ITA, Bari/91/2007/ITA and 5010/2009/ITA appeared equally distant from the feline NoV strain M49-1/2012/JPN (75.5\u201380.4% aa). This feline strain (GenBank accession number LC011950) is registered in NCBI sequence database as a GVI.1 strain, although it does not fit the criteria for being assigned to this genotype and it was tentatively proposed as a fourth GVI genotype, GVI.4 (Table 1, Table 3; Fig. 1).",

GII NoV have been found in human and pigs, although porcine NoVs belong to different genotypes (GII.11, GII.18 and GII.19) (Wang et al., 2005). GIII NoV infect ruminants, with genotypes GIII.1 and GIII.2 (Liu et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2007) being identified in cattle and genotype GIII.3 in sheep (Wolf et al., 2009). However, circulation of NoVs strains belonging to the same genotype in different host species seems rather uncommon. By converse, it seems clear that carnivores (canids and felids) may be infected by NoV strains with the same capsid or polymerase (pol) types (Table 1). Binding of human NoVs to human tissues seems to be mediated by antigens of the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) family and therefore to be genetically determined (Marionneau et al., 2002). Likewise, binding of GIV.2 and GVI NoVs in dog tissues seems mediated by antigens of the HBGA family (Caddy et al., 2014). Interestingly, virus-like particles (VLPs) of seven different human NoV genotypes (GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, and GII.12) were also found to bind to canine gastrointestinal tissues (Caddy et al., 2015) and human NoV strains of genotypes GII.4 and GII.12 were detected from infected dogs (Summa et al., 2012). Whether dogs and cats share similar HBGAs that can be used as attachment factors by NoV could be hypothesized. Alternatively, carnivore HBGAs could be more \u201cpermissive\u201d, i.e. they could allow binding of NoVs of different genotypes. Regardless, this intriguing phenomenon could be a key factor explaining the apparent genetic diversity of carnivore NoVs.",

The canine strains 63.15/2015/ITA, and FD53/2007/ITA possessed a pol gene of the same lineage as the canine NoV strain GVI.2/C33/Viseu/2007/PRT (pol c), whilst strain FD210/2007/ITA shared the same lineage (pol b) as the canine NoV strains GVI.1/Bari/91/2007/ITA, GIV.2/170/2007/ITA and GIV.2/Thessaloniki/30/2008/GRC (Fig. 1; Table 1). A unique lineage (pol a) was formed by feline NoVs of genogroup GIV and GVI and by the lion NoV strain GIV.2/Pistoia/2006/ITA. Interestingly, inconsistencies were observed between the pol- and capsid-based phylogenies, which are suggestive of potential recombination events (Table 1). This phenomenon has been reported repeatedly when studying NoVs from carnivores (Di Martino et al., 2016, Martella et al., 2009, Takano et al., 2015). The canine NoV strain Bari/91/2007/ITA, resembles GIV.2 NoVs in its pol gene (pol b) whilst it possesses a GVI.1 capsid (Martella et al., 2009). The feline NoV strain, M49-1/2012/JPN possesses a GIV.2 pol (pol a), and a GVI capsid (Takano et al., 2015), whilst the feline strain TE/77-13/2013/ITA possesses a GIV.2 pol (pol a) and a GVI.2 capsid (Di Martino et al., 2016). In all the cases, the recombination site was located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap, a region highly conserved across all NoV sequences (Bull et al., 2005). RNA recombination is a major force driving viral evolution (Worobey and Holmes, 1999, Lai, 1992). Recombination in viruses may substantially affect phylogenetic groupings, confusing molecular epidemiologic studies, and also can have major implications in vaccine design (Bull et al., 2005). A recombinant NoV can be defined as a strain that clusters with 2 distinct groups of NoV strains when 2 different regions (normally the capsid and polymerase) of the genome are subjected to phylogenetic analysis (Bull et al., 2005). Accordingly, analysis of the diagnostic regions located on the RdRp cannot be used to characterize unequivocally these animal NoVs and a definitive characterization should rely on the ORF2 as proposed for humans NoVs strains (Kroneman et al., 2013).",

These studies are important as they allow us to obtain information on the genetic diversity of viruses, a step that is propaedeutic to the development of accurate diagnostic tools and necessary for the understanding of viral evolution. Analysis of NoVs identified in carnivores thus far is unveiling a marked genetic diversity and suggests that the evolution of canine and feline NoV is tightly intermingled. This could have implications when enacting prophylaxis measures in animal populations (such as humane shelters, kennels or breeding facilities), as cats and dogs may be infected by a number of common pathogens (Decaro et al., 2010, Di Martino et al., 2009, Di Martino et al., 2016, Martella et al., 2002, Pratelli et al., 2003). Finally, as some animal viruses may be transmitted to humans, generating new threats for human health, defining a baseline of the genetic diversity on animal viruses is important, to understand better and readily identify the origin of novel human viruses.",
