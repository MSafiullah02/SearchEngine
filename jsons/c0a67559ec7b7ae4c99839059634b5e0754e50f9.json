Because EpCs cover the body surfaces, they represent a primary site of host \u2194 microbe interaction. Of importance are mucosal surfaces prone to contact with pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes, which requires that immune recognition principles have to be tightly controlled to avoid uncontrolled permanent activation. To be an effective physical first barrier of defense against invading infectious pathogens, EpCs, all intensely equipped with PRMs such as TLRs and NLRs, have evolved innate immune antimicrobial functions able to secrete local antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins [1] (for antimicrobial peptides, see Part VI, Sect. 23.4) . Epithelial barriers are not only responsible for the sequestration of microorganisms and their inactivation but also exert homeostatic functions. Remarkably, EpCs possess an intrinsic capacity to survive despite continuous exposure to considerable amounts of microorganisms in the environment that are potentially toxic to host cells, suggesting that some homeostatic forces link antimicrobial strategies to mechanisms that control tissue integrity. In fact, evidence has already been reviewed in support of microbial factors in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues [2] .",

In fact, there is growing evidence suggesting that innate immune mechanisms in cells of the oral mucosa represent an effective first-line defense against pathogens that enter and contaminate the oral cavity on a daily basis. Gingival epithelium accounts for a robust innate immune defense system that works in many ways for the protection of underlying connective tissue. First, it provides a physical barrier which does not allow microbes to invade while enabling selective transaction with the oral environment. Second, upon interaction with microbes, it secretes cytokines as well as chemokines to activate the influx of neutrophils and other immune cells into the sulcular area [11, 12] . Third, the gingival epithelium has been found to be a source of antimicrobial peptides which are crucial for an effective innate immune humoral defense response [13] . Cells of the gingival epithelium are equipped with various PRMs including TLRs [12, 14] and NLRs such as NLRP3 that forms the inflammasome [15, 16] . Again, when uncontrolled, MAMP/DAMP-induced, PRM-mediated innate immune responses of cells of the oral cavity may cause pathologies in the form of gingivitis and periodontitis which may result in chronic periodontal diseases [17] .",

The cell layer not only forms a sizeable mechanical barrier but is also predisposed as a sentinel system to detect pathogens and non-pathogenic toxic agents entering via the airways. To rapidly initiate an acute innate immune inflammatory defense response in these circumstances, the airway epithelium is equipped with a variety of PRMs, in particular, TLRs that are able to recognize MAMPs and/or DAMPs [18] [19] [20] [21] . In addition to TLRs, cytosolic NLRs have also been shown to be involved in airway epithelium activation. For example, in human lung epithelium, expression of NOD1 and lower expression of NOD2 was detected in resting human BEAS-2B cells (an immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line), suggesting that PRM-bearing airway EpCs are essential contributors to innate mucosal immunity and provide a variety of antimicrobial effectors [22] . Of particular relevance is the NLRP3 receptor that upon activation by DAMPs is capable of forming an inflammasome, thereby contributing to lung inflammation. For example, novel data have shown the presence and functional activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the DAMP cristobalite silica in human lung EpCs that may contribute to lung diseases [23] (for silica particles as exogenous DAMPs, see Part IV, Sect. 15.2.4). Thus, via recognition of MAMPs and/ or DAMPs by PRMs, bronchial EpCs play a critical role in the regulation of pulmonary tissue homeostasis by the modulation of numerous molecules, from antioxidants and lipid mediators to growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines [24] .",

These cells operate as critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration [29, 30] .",

Indeed, several studies have shown that uterine and cervico-vaginal EpCs-besides macrophages and DCs-execute immunological functions by expressing PRMs such as TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs. However, the mechanism by which these cells work together is still limited [63] [64] [65] . In fact, given the nascent state of knowledge concerning this important area, it is clear that more studies are needed to provide valuable insights into immunobiology of uterine and cervico-vaginal EpCs.",

They are significant contributors to innate mucosal immunity and generate various sophisticated antimicrobial defense mechanisms including the formation of a tight barrier and the secretion of antimicrobial substances. EpCs functionally express multiple PRMs to provide these active defense mechanisms. Notably, mucosal surfaces are prone to contact with pathogenic as well as commensal non-pathogenic microbes, and therefore, immune recognition principles must be strictly regulated to avoid uncontrolled permanent activation. Indeed, these balancing mechanisms are probably due to the pathogen-induced emission of DAMPs which are recognized by EpCs together with MAMPs on the one hand and a result of MAMP recognition alone in the presence of commensals on the other hand. But this has to be proven in future experiments. As also stressed elsewhere [66] , deciphering these mechanisms will provide essential understanding to how mucosal tissues maintain health and activate immunity, as well as how pathogens promote disease.",

This view has been challenged by data illustrating extensive phenotypic heterogeneity among fibroblasts from different tissues and a given tissue under various physiologic conditions. For example, as reviewed [69] , lung fibroblasts have been demonstrated to be heterogeneous in cell surface marker expression as well as in their levels of collagen production. Cardiac fibroblasts were shown to be well-established as key regulators of ECM turnover in the context of myocardial remodelling and fibrosis. Also, periodontal fibroblasts also are characterized by heterogeneity based on morphology, glycogen pools, and collagen production. Further, fibroblasts from different anatomic sites have been found to possess distinct transcriptional patterns. Under appropriate stimulation, for example, mediated by DAMPs, quiescent fibroblasts can acquire an active synthetic, contractile phenotype and express several SMC markers (i.e., myofibroblasts) which are not exclusive to fibroblasts. On the other hand, human hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts show the biologic characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells [69, 70] .",

Traditionally, fibroblasts are defined as local resident cells of mesenchymal origin. The mesenchymal cells that form the fibroblast population are believed to be derived from a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This transition process is a form of cell plasticity in which EpCs lose their special molecular markers and acquire mesenchymal phenotypes associated with expression of proteins of fibroblasts [70, 71] . A similar process, called endothelialmesenchymal transition (EndMT) has also been reported. The EndMT is a fundamental cellular mechanism that regulates embryonic development and diseases such as cancer and fibrosis. Recent developments in biomedical research have shown remarkable potential to harness the EMT process for tissue engineering and regeneration [72, 73] . In addition, another source of fibroblasts refers to circulating fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes that are derived from bone marrow stem cells [74] . Finally, so-called pericytes have been suggested to contribute to the adult interstitial fibroblast population able to synthesize collagen as well [75] .",

For example, receptor activation on cardiac fibroblasts by DAMPs has been shown to be coupled to altered cellular function including changes in proliferation, migration, myofibroblast transdifferentiation, ECM turnover, and production of fibrotic and inflammatory paracrine factors which directly impact on the heart's ability to respond to injury [68] . Moreover, investigations on human gingival fibroblasts revealed clear The mesenchymal cells that form the fibroblast population derive from processes called epithelial-to-mesenchymal and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The processes are discussed to result from a collective series of DAMP-induced transcriptional and post-translational events that cause epithelial and endothelial cells to take on mesenchymal features, thus allowing the cells to separate from the tissue context and gain motility.

This is good news, but there is again bad news: uncontrolled excessive and/or permanent activation of myofibroblasts by DAMPs may lead to excessive ECM and collagen production during their proliferation, thereby replacing regular organ structure (see also Part VIII, Sect. 36.4). These events result in functional impairment and scar formation, which may further trigger persistent fibrogenesis and fibrosis. In fact, myofibroblasts are regarded as a significant type of effector cells in organ fibrosis that, aside from secreting copious amounts of ECM proteins, provide signalling molecules to drive fibrosis. Myofibroblasts also mediate the mechano-regulation of fibrotic matrix remodelling via contraction of their stress fibers [70, 81] . As a matter of fact, several life-threatening/lethal chronic human diseases are due to such an overshooting organ fibrosis-as described in more detail in Volume 2.",

To handle such challenges, the sessile cells such as ECs and VSMCs but also adventitial cells, equipped with various PRMs to sense MAMPs and/ or DAMPs, are capable of mounting robust innate immune responses and also recruiting mobile cells such as macrophages and DCs to a site of attack. This results in the creation of an acute inflammatory milieu in the vessel wall aimed at curing the vascular injury concerned. In the following, a few remarks are made on innate vascular cells, that is, vessel wall-residing cells and mobile vascular macrophages and DCs.",

            "text": "Endothelial cells serve as the interface between circulating blood and surrounding tissues. As estimated, the average human adult apparently contains over one trillion ECs that cover a surface area in excess of 1 million cm 2 and altogether weigh ~1 kg [82, 83] . Endothelial cells dynamically regulate the vascular barrier, modulate vasomotor tone, play central roles in coagulation and hemostasis, and, in addition, are critically involved in the movement of leukocytes between the bloodstream and extravascular tissues ( Fig. 9 .2) [84, 85] . Moreover, ECs-as VSMCs-play a dominant role in DAMP-induced angiogenesis following vascular injury but unfortunately, on the other hand, are also required for the growth of some tumors and atherosclerosis, among other pathologies. Of note, ECs are increasingly appreciated as key members of the whole family of cells of innate immune cells that are actively involved in defense responses of healthy arteries to infectious and sterile injury [86, 87] . Accordingly, ECs typically express PRRs including members of the TLR family (Refs. [84, [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] ) as well as the NLR and RLR families (Refs. [84, [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] ). Engagement of endothelial PRRs with MAMPs and/or DAMPs was shown to up-regulate the secretion of specific cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and, in addition, to increase the binding of neutrophils to the endothelium (Refs. [84, 90, [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] ).",

As executed at various locations of the body, phagocytosing vascular macrophages can participate in debris removal and efferocytosis (see Part VI, Sect. 22.6.3), and evidence has been presented that they can mediate cytotoxic functions in the vessel wall as well. Notably, defective efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis is regarded as a significant promoter of atherosclerotic plaques progression [121] . Importantly, there is another mechanism of atherosclerosis progression: macrophages engulf the deposited normal and modified lipoproteins, transforming them into cholesterol-laden foam cells. Foam cells, known as characteristic cells involved in atherosclerosis, persist in plaques and promote disease progression through several mechanisms including contribution to plaque instability [127] .",

Sessile resident vascular DCs have been observed in the intima of atherosclerosis-prone vascular regions exposed to disturbed blood flow patterns. In experiments on mice, several phenotypically and functionally distinct vascular DC subsets including cDCs and pDCs have been described [128] . Similar to mice, in humans, DCs can be detected in the arterial intima of healthy young individuals, and increased numbers of DCs have been observed in atherosclerotic lesions [129] . Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the different DC subsets awaits further investigations. Human vascular DCs are mainly found in the plaque shoulder and ruptureprone regions as well as in marginal parts of the plaque core. The majority of DCs in advanced plaques appears to be activated as revealed by the expression of costimulatory molecules which allow them to stimulate autoreactive T cells [129] .

Ironically, when the vascular insults turn out to be too severe or occur chronic-repetitively and persistently, this primarily beneficial protective function of vascular cells shifts to the contrary, namely, chronic inflammation associated with overshooting repair mechanisms (VSMC proliferation!), which drive lifethreatening atherosclerotic processes. In fact, atherosclerosis as a chronic disease is characterized by two fundamental hallmarks: innate immune-mediated inflammation and lipid retention. Accumulating evidence suggests that ECs, VSMCs, adventitial cells, and-perhaps most importantly-vascular DCs and macrophages are predominantly involved in atherogenesis. Pattern recognition molecules such as TLRs, NLRs, and RLHs have been identified as an essential link between the immune system and cardiovascular disease development. In fact, there is rapidly growing evidence indicating that DAMPs \u2194 PRMs interactions contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis and its concomitant diseases. Although much has been discovered about TLR activation in cellular components of the cardiovascular system, the roles that individual members of the TLR, NLR, and RLH family have in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases and associated clinical practice remain undefined.

Chronic mechanical injury or excessive levels of ROS may damage chondrocytes or even result in their death associated with the release of DAMPs [135, 136] . So it is not surprising that these cells are also equipped with various PRMs including TLRs that can sense DAMPs to initiate inflammatory responses [136, 137] . In fact, mature chondrocytes express TLR1 and TLR2 and may react to cartilage matrix/chondrocyte-derived DAMPs. This interaction may lead to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines which stimulate further TLRs and expression of inducible DAMPs such as cytokines, thereby establishing a vicious circle. Apart from a role of TLRs, there is first evidence suggesting that the recognition receptor RAGE when stimulated by the DAMP S100A4 (for S100 proteins, also compare Part IV, Sects. 12.2.4.2 and 14.2.2.4) can activate human articular chondrocytes, thereby promoting joint inflammation [138, 139] .",

As mentioned above, as vital bone-resorbing cells, they play a pivotal role in skeletal development and adult bone remodelling. They also participate in the pathogenesis of various human bone diseases. Osteoclasts differentiate from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation of two essential factors, the M-CSF and receptor activation of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) [146] . The close relationship of osteoclast function to responses of the innate immune system has already been recognized. Thus, there is growing evidence suggesting that DAMP-induced activation of PRM-bearing cells of the innate immune system may be involved in osteoclast formation [147, 148] . In particular, DAMP-triggered activation of TLR5 has been shown to activate RANKL and osteoclast formation and therefore represents a potential key factor in inflammation-induced bone erosions in diseases like RA, reactive arthritis, and periodontitis [149] . These data are of interest regarding the observation that TLR5 can be activated by endogenous ligands produced in inflamed RA synovium and, thus, may reflect a first clue that TLR5 may play a crucial role in inflammatory bone loss seen in a wide range of autoimmune and infectious diseases [149, 150] .",

However, in recent years, this view has dramatically changed following insight into the metabolic and immunological functions of preadipocytes and adipocytes. Today, it is well-established that adipose tissue is an active metabolic tissue that is composed of many functionally and developmentally distinct cell types, including the \"stromal vascular fraction\"-a heterogeneous mixture of mesenchymal, endothelial, and hematopoietic cell types, however, the metabolic core being the adipocyte. In obese individuals, adipose tissue consists of ~50% of total body mass and, thus, represents a significant compartment of the innate immune system capable of influencing systemic inflammation. Of note, the continuous extensive expansion of adipose tissue during obesity steadily increases its ability to act as an immunological tissue that can switch from controlled to uncontrolled systemic inflammation associated with considerable pathologies [153] [154] [155] . Modern classification of adipocytes encompasses three primary types-white, brown, and beige-with distinct origins, anatomic distributions, and homeostatic functions. White adipose tissue has long been recognized as the main energy reservoir derived from food intake. White adipose tissue, composed of adipocytes that are held together by a poorly vascularized and innervated connective tissue, stores dietary energy in a highly concentrated form as triglyceride, mostly in a single large lipid droplet. In periods of caloric need, these triglycerides can be rapidly hydrolyzed by lipases (a process known as lipolysis), and the resulting free fatty acids are then released and transported to other tissues to be oxidized in mitochondria as an energy source. However, the WAT is not only a site of an energy reservoir but also acts as an active metabolic organ that can secrete specific bioactive molecules that have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions. Some of these secreted molecules function as a variety of adipokines as well as pro-and anti-inflammatory proteins (e.g., TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and adiponectin and IL-10, respectively) [155] [156] [157] [158] .",

Also, it could be demonstrated that TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 protein co-localized with adiponectin in human adipocytes, with TLR4 exhibiting the highest immunohistochemical expression [159] [160] [161] . It is also worthwhile to briefly mention here that the dual activation of TLR4 in adipocytes by LPS and fatty acids represents a molecular gate that connects innate immunity with metabolism [153] . Potential DAMPs in adipose tissue released by dying adipocytes or individual lipids are thus present in increased concentrations in obesity [162] . It is therefore of high interest to identify what PRRs mediate the link between obesity and adipose tissue inflammation.

Previously, the term \"immune cells\" was restricted to mobile and versatile cells such as DCs, macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes; however, presently, we are learning about an entire family of cells with different functions. We may distinguish cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, mobile circulating cells, sessile cells, resident tissue cells, and so on. Ultimately, a whole organism-a body-is designed as a \"defense machinery\" with different body parts and tissues having distinct functions and exerting different mechanisms of defense. In this context, Matzinger [163] concludes: \"In their own defense, tissues send a panoply of signals that initiate immunity and guide the choice of effector class. Th1-Th2 and Treg is far too simple a representation of the breathtaking variety of the resulting responses.\" Moreover, all those innate immune cells are committed to rapidly recognizing both infective and sterile inciting insults, aimed at mediating essential mechanisms of elimination of the inciting agent (e.g., pathogens) as well as-if necessary-facilitating and preparing subsequent acquired/adaptive immune responses. As also discussed elsewhere [164] , numerous intricate interactions among the various innate cells take place that finally guarantee protective immunity. Thus, rather than acting as isolated sensory and effector cells, innate immune cells are in constant communication and collaboration with each other, locally and distally. These interactions are critically important for the efficient control of both infectious and sterile injuries.",
