            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by airflow limitation and is a progressive disease that is not fully reversible 1. The World Health Organization has predicted that COPD will be the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030 2, 3. Tissues from patients with COPD are characterized by chronic inflammation, mucus metaplasia, alveolar destruction and structural cell apoptosis 4. Inflammation is an important factor in the development of COPD 5. Inflammation in patients may be causally related to emphysema or other pathological alterations in the lungs and worsens with disease progression 6, 7. Pulmonary inflammation might have an adverse impact on various extrapulmonary organs, such as blood vessels and the heart 8, 9, 10. During the progression of pulmonary inflammation in COPD, both the innate immune and adaptive immune systems are involved. However, their specific mechanisms are still elusive. This is particularly true for the innate immune system, whose role is unknown during the inflammation response in COPD.",

Its role in the airways involves the detection of pathogen\u2010 or damage\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors (RLRs) 11. Latent infection of adenoviruses in childhood can promote chronic inflammation and thus gradually lead to COPD 12. Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of viruses can cause exacerbation of the disease 13, 14. Compared with exacerbation due to other causes, viral\u2010induced COPD exacerbation is more severe, lasts longer and is associated with airway and systemic inflammatory responses 15, 16. RLRs are newly discovered pattern recognition receptors, which play a critical role in the elimination of viral infections 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. RLRs include RIG\u2010I, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA\u20105) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) 23, 24, 25. These RLRs localize within the cytoplasm. When viral RNA binds to the C\u2010terminal regulatory domain of RIG\u2010I or MDA\u20105, it can initiate a signaling cascade leading to activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF\u20103, which are needed to turn on transcription of interferons (IFNs) 26, 27, 28. The LGP2 lacks a caspase activation and recruitment domain and incapable of interferon production 29.",

In this study, we assessed the expression of RIG\u2010I and MDA\u20105 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchial tissue of COPD patients. We demonstrate that COPD patients have significantly different expression levels of RLRs and inflammatory cytokines, thus may define a critical role for RLRs in COPD airway inflammation.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in 25 COPD patients and 15 non\u2010COPD control subjects was performed by infusing 50 mL of sterile sodium chloride in either the middle or lingula lobe. The diagnosis of COPD was made according to the guidelines of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. All subjects were in a stable condition at the time of the study, and all control subjects have normal lung function. Exclusion criteria included a current or recent (past month) respiratory tract infection, exacerbation of respiratory disease or a course of oral steroids or antibiotics in the previous month.

Structural cells, especially epithelial cells, endothelium and fibroblasts, take part in the airway inflammation. Patients with COPD are more susceptible to viral infections, and up to one half of cases of COPD exacerbations are associated with viral infections 16, 34. An epidemiology survey illustrates that viral infection is the main cause of COPD exacerbation, and the top four causes are rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus 13.",

In contrast, MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs through detection of dsRNA replication intermediates and genomic dsRNAs, and likely detects positive\u2010strand and dsRNA viruses including RV and reoviruses 38, 39, 40. An epidemiological survey has illustrated that RV, a positive and single\u2010stranded RNA virus, is responsible for the majority of virus\u2010induced COPD exacerbation 13, 34. In COPD patients, RV infection causes a rapid decline in lung function. Recent studies by Wang and colleagues provide evidence that MDA\u20105, but not RIG\u2010I, is responsible for recognizing RV, and subsequently activates the signaling pathways, causing an exaggerated inflammatory response in COPD patients, with increased levels of IL\u20108, IL\u20106, CXCL1, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 41.

These results are consistent with previously reported increases in systemic and airway cytokine in COPD patients 42. However, we show for the first time that the basal level of MDA\u20105 is elevated in the bronchial mucosa and PBMCs from patients with COPD. Our data implies that the exaggerated inflammatory response to RV infection in COPD patients may be associated with the high level of MDA\u20105 in airway epithelial cells. Excess MDA\u20105 in COPD patients activated by RV could lead to induction of a \u2018cytokine flood\u2019.

There was no significant correlation between the mRNA levels of MDA\u20105 in bronchial biopsy and FEV1 %pred, which may have been due to the small number of bronchial biopsies samples in this study or the particular cell types present. As we all know, the major cell type in PBMCs are lymphocytes and monocytes, while the major cell type in bronchial biopsies samples is epithelial cells. As the lymphocytes and monocytes are a critical component in the immune system to fight infection and adapt to intruders, the MDA\u20105 produced in these cells can induce higher inflammatory response than in epithelial cells, which may lead to different correlation between bronchial biopsy and PBMCs.",
