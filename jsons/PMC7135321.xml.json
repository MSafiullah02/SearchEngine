However, most investigations have used animals, and treatment in human beings has mainly focused on the most severe cases. Treatment with anti-influenza virus antibodies has not yet been shown safe and effective for use in non-pregnant people.1 It will probably be even longer before such treatment options would be considered for pregnant women since additional safety studies would need to be done, and pregnant women and their health-care providers might be reluctant to use new treatments, even if proven safe and effective.",

Frequent hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, staying home and away from others when sick, and avoiding contact with people sick with influenza-like illness are basic steps that can help decrease the likelihood of influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Owing to the increased risk of severe disease and death, once influenza is suspected in a pregnant woman, appropriate antiviral therapy should be started promptly, ideally within 48 h when the benefit is expected to be the greatest. Although there are known side-effects of antiviral therapy, as pointed out by Burioni and colleagues, the benefits of antiviral therapy outweigh potential risks for pregnant women.",

We agree that experience with managing pregnant women during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome probably helped prepare them and others for this current influenza pandemic2 and that there is much for us to learn from the experiences and successes of others.",
