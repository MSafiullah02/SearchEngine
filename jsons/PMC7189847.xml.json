A crosstalk between S1 and S2 then activates the pre-fusion conformation, activating S2 itself. The S1 subunit can be further divided into four core domains: S1a, S1b, S1c and S1d.",

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 share 77.5% similarity in the amino acid sequence of S1. As mentioned above, viral entry in the host requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, which involve S protein cleavage in S1 and S2 subunits where the S2 subunit allows the fusion of viral and cellular membranes; the S protein of SARS-CoV engages ACE-2 as the \u201centry-receptor\u201d (Li et al., 2003) and employs the cellular serine-protease TMPRSS2 for S-priming (Glowacka et al., 2011). Due to the high percentage identity of amino-acid sequence between SARS-CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV2 S-protein, it is highly possible that both SARS viruses use the same serine-protease. The linking to ACE-2 for virus entry infection shows \u201chigh efficiency\u201d in its function and this is a possibly a major factor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 high transmissibility (Li et al., 2005). Is also possible that a TMPRSS2-inhibitor, approved for clinical use, blocks entry of the virus and constitutes a treatment option (Hoffmann et al., 2020).",

During this research, we have used the Hill function formalism to illustrate the ligand-protein binding process. Details are provided in section 3. ACE-2, on the host cell membrane, is usually connected to another protein called B0AT1. SARS-CoV2 infection begins with the initial formation of a hetero trimer consisting of the RBD domain of the S1 subunit, from ACE-2 protein (in its PD domain) and B0AT1 protein. For future research, this trimeric complex can be explored and manipulated. A study conducted by (Wrapp et al., 2020) suggests that ACE-2 must dimerise to become activate, resulting in two PD homo-dimer domains capable of binding the SARS-CoV2 S protein and forming a trimer. Furthermore, they reported that SARS-CoV2 protein S forms trimers with two of the RBD domains: one facing upwards and one facing downwards. This structure is presented in Fig. 2.",

            "text": "Researchers around the world are making every effort to develop a vaccine against the virus, for example a recent study reported the dependence of \u201cSARS-CoV-2 cell entry\u201d on ACE2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The molecular bond between SARS-CoV2 spike protein and ACE2 looks similar to that of the SARS-CoV, but there are some differences in the precise amino acids used to bind SARS-CoV2 to that ACE2 receptor compared to SARS-CoV. Most likely the high affinity, probably derived from such small variations of 2019-nCoV S protein for human ACE2, may contribute to the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human to human (Wrapp et al., 2020). Recently (Wang et al., 2020), have discussed the possibility of using a monoclonal antibody as an antiviral therapy: i.e. \u201c47D11\u201d antibody that targets the trimeric complex involving glycoprotein S. In this research, tests performed by the ELISA cross-reactivity system with S1-SARS-S hybridomas in supernatant indicated four types of hybridomas showing a cross reactivity with S1 subunits. Among these hybridomas, the one called 47D11 showed neutralization activity for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 and targeted the RBD domain of S1b. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2020) showed that 47D11 has a greater affinity for the ectodomain of the S (Secto) protein of SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV2, despite the antigen being present in equimolar amounts. This bond, however, does not compete with the binding of S1b with ACE-2.47D11 is included among the monoclonal antibodies that can inactivate the \u201cS-protein\u201d of SARS-CoV2 by preventing the formation of the pre-fusion structure (Walls et al., 2019). A further structural analysis has shown that \u201cS1b\u201d core domain can be divided into a core subdomain of about 338\u2013506 amino acids and a receptor-binding subdomain of about 438\u2013498 amino acids; the latter consists of a \u201cloop\u201d protruding from the \u03b2-sheet structure of the core subdomain. Currently, the inhibition mechanism operated by 47D11 is not understood. Thus in this review we investigate through a quantitative mathematical model, the possible existence of a \u201ccooperative binding\u201d that CoViD-19 shows in the infection process as described above. Our hypothesis is supported by the need for activation of the infection system by the virus, given by the particular molecular kinetics that leads to the formation of the \u201cinfection trimer\u201d given by the viral S1 protein and the ACE-2 receptor complex. Some studies have shown the possibility of an analysis in this sense conducted through the \u201cHill function\u201d and have shown a \u201cpositive cooperativity\u201d in the case of infection of para-flu viruses that act by binding with a Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase Receptor (Tappert et al., 2013). The interaction, demonstrated by 47D11 monoclonal antibody, does not affect the bond between the protein S and ACE-2 but has affinity with the RBD domain of the same protein S, suggesting that there is a \u201cfacilitation\u201d implying an amplification of the process that, in turn, causes an increase in the infection capacity. In Section 2 the background and the development of the model are described, whereas Section 3 discusses the facts linked with the novel virus onset. The conclusions and future work are provided after the discussion.",
