The great variety of antibodies, as well as their high specificity and affinity for antigens, makes it possible to use these molecules for purposes other than passive protection against diseases. Indeed, antibodies are one of the favourite tools of biologists and are extensively used for various in vivo and in vitro diagnostics. Antibodies may also have natural enzymatic activities, which can be optimized by mutations [1]. These antibodies, known as abzymes, might become a new source of enzymes. Furthermore, antibodies could be used to manage environmental pollution by neutralizing toxic substances [2].",

For example, the administration of recombinant antibodies can be used to protect patients against respiratory syncytial virus infection [3]. Such an approach is particularly attractive when no vaccines or antibiotics are available or when the pathogens have become resistant to antibiotics [4]. Interestingly, not only IgG but complete recombinant chimaeric IgA can also be used to inactivate pathogens in patients [5]. Antibodies can also mediate protection against intracellular pathogens [6]. In this respect, they could provide a major line of defence against biological attack by terrorists [4], particularly as they can be kept as a powder and easily self-injected in case of attack.",

Grams of antibodies per litre of milk have been repeatedly obtained. Optimization of vectors and, particularly, the use of gene insulators will allow increased and more predictable production of antibodies in milk [45]. Recent work has shown that loci are bordered by DNA regions insulating their genes from those of the neighbouring loci. The known insulators contain silencers preventing cross-talk between genes of neighbouring loci, chromatin openers to give free access to the transcription machinery, and enhancers [46]. One insulator from the chicken \u03b2-globin locus allowed most if not all transgenic lines to express foreign genes under the control of a ubiquitous promoter [47] and a milk protein gene promoter (S Rival-Gervier, unpublished results). Interestingly, long genomic DNA fragments containing two independent milk protein genes (\u03b1-lactalbumin and whey acidic protein) allowed the highly efficient expression of these genes in transgenic mice 48., 49., 50.. These data strongly suggest that the long DNA fragments contained insulators, which can be associated to gene constructs to optimize their expression in milk. Although CHO cells have a more limited production capacity, they could still provide a cheaper production system than goat milk for quantities ranging from 10 to 50 kg per year [51].",

The reality is more subtle: it is possible to breed animals in conditions where they are not subjected to infections [52\u2022\u2022]. Animals can be bred that are not contaminated by prions and the presence of prions in purified proteins can be detected. In the future, animals with an inactive prion protein gene could be available. One species, the rabbit, is known to transmit only rare and minor diseases to humans. Moreover, this animal is not susceptible to prion diseases and may prove useful for antibody production in the future.",

Domestic transgenic plants and animals can be maintained in already defined standard conditions and their levels of production are very stable. Milk secretion is essentially constant for weeks or months (depending on the species) and the same is true for the secretion of recombinant proteins in milk. In cell culture, protein glycosylation is known to be dependent on CHO metabolism, which is variable according to culture conditions 24\u2022., 31.. By contrast, the metabolism of the mammary cell is much more stable and the glycosylation of the recombinant protein secreted in milk is constant for weeks or months. Lines of transgenic plants and animals can be preserved using well-known techniques. Seeds and milk can be easily stored until it is time to purify the antibodies without any loss of activity.",

Furthermore, transgenic plants are acknowledged to disseminate their genes in neighbouring fields in an uncontrolled manner. This phenomenon is expected to have a negligible impact for agriculture in most cases. The situation is quite different for pharmaceutical-producing plants. These environmental problems are expected to be solved using systems to control plant reproduction. Such problems are unlikely to be encountered with farm animals, which are kept in enclosed areas. Biological fluids, other than milk, from transgenic animals can theoretically be the source of pharmaceutical proteins [53]. Among these systems, egg white from transgenic chickens appears the most attractive [54] (see also Update). At present, the production of antibodies in milk is more technically mature than other systems using transgenic animals, including chickens [54] or plants [27].",
