For these reasons, several such proteins, among them cyanovirin-N (Boyd et al., 1997) and scytovirin (Bokesch et al., 2003), have been under active development as topical antiviral therapeutics. Most recently, another potent antiviral lectin, griffithsin, was isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., collected from the waters off New Zealand (Mori et al., 2005). Griffithsin was shown to inhibit the cytopathic effects of different isolates of HIV-1 at concentrations as low as 43 pM (Mori et al., 2005), and its binding to viral envelope glycoproteins was shown to be directly dependent on their glycosylation states. These properties make griffithsin a promising potential candidate for development as a future pharmaceutical agent.",

More careful analysis of the sequence of griffithsin indicates that this protein belongs to a diverse family of \u03b2-prism-I (or jacalin-related) lectins (Raval et al., 2004) and shares structural characteristics with proteins such as jacalin (Aucouturier et al., 1987), artocarpin (Jeyaprakash et al., 2004), and heltuba (Bourne et al., 1999) (\nFigure 1A). However, sequence identity between griffithsin and any of these other proteins is less than 30% (Mori et al., 2005) (see also Figure 1A). Thus, structural details, particularly of the carbohydrate binding site(s), cannot be readily modeled, necessitating solution of an experimental structure. We report here the structures of griffithsin in three crystal forms, with and without bound carbohydrate molecules.",

            "text": "The structure of griffithsin was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) with selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein produced in E. coli and was refined at high resolution with material grown in plants. Three different crystal forms of griffithsin were studied (\nTable 1). The fold of griffithsin corresponds to the well-known \u03b2-prism motif (Chothia and Murzin, 1993), found mainly in a variety of lectins but also in some other proteins (Shimizu and Morikawa, 1996). The motif consists of three repeats of an antiparallel four-stranded \u03b2 sheet that form a triangular prism. However, unlike other lectins whose sequences are compared in Figure 1A, griffithsin forms an intimate dimer (\nFigure 2) in which the first two \u03b2 strands of one chain (consisting of 18 residues located at its N terminus) are associated with ten strands of the other chain (and vice versa). That arrangement is unique among the family members that have been described so far and is seen in all crystal forms of griffithsin, despite the presence of a significant nonnative N-terminal extension in one of them. Thus, griffithsin can be described as a domain-swapped dimer, although it is not clear whether a corresponding monomeric forms does (or even could) exist. A considerable distance between the residues A18 and B19 (10.5 \u00c5 between their C\u03b1 atoms) is much larger than a corresponding distance in the domain-swapped proteins that have been shown to exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, such as, for example, another antiviral lectin, cyanovirn-N (Yang et al., 1999). In our previous study that utilized size-exclusion chromatography, griffithsin was shown to exist as a homodimer in solution (Giomarelli et al., 2006).",

However, in griffithsin, these sequences are found in loops connecting the first and fourth strand of each sheet rather than in interdomain linkers and are very well ordered. As discussed below, the main chain amide of the last residue of each of these sequences participates in creation of a ligand binding site, and the strict conservation of this sequence may be related to the presence of three monosaccharide binding sites on each molecule of griffithsin.",

However, the six principal sites are arranged in two groups of three, one on molecule A and the other on molecule B, and are very similar in both structures. The only significant difference is that whereas the electron density in the lower-resolution structure (\nFigure 4) could be interpreted as resulting from the presence of exclusively \u03b1 mannose, clear indications of the presence of an admixture of \u03b2 mannose are seen in the atomic-resolution structure.

Crystals of the His-tagged griffithsin contained only a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, whereas both crystal forms grown from the plant-expressed material contained two. However, only the latter crystals diffracted to atomic (or at least near-atomic) resolution, both in the presence and absence of bound carbohydrate. In all crystals that did not contain bound carbohydrate, the binding sites exhibited considerable disorder, with even the side chains of the strictly conserved tyrosines 28, 68, and 110 showing significant flexibility. The presence of carbohydrates, whether soaked in or cocrystallized, stabilized the binding sites and significantly lowered the temperature factors of the residues involved in their binding.",

These include its unusual domain-swapped dimeric structure, its three repeated domains, and its six independent binding sites for monosaccharides. The antiviral lectin cyanovirin-N has previously been reported to form domain-swapped dimers but they differed from the griffithsin dimers in that half of the each molecule was involved in swapping, rather than two \u03b2 strands out of 12. Both monomers and dimers of cyanovirin-N could be isolated, whereas we have seen no indications of the existence of griffithsin in a monomeric form. In addition, only four carbohydrate binding sites are present in each dimer of cyanovirin-N, rather than six in griffithsin.",

            "text": "The presence of three almost identical domains in each molecule of griffithsin is a unique adaptation of the \u03b2-prism-I family and an advance in our knowledge of the structural complexity of this group of lectins. The other structurally closely related lectins (Figures 1A and 3) contain either a single carbohydrate binding site, or at most two such sites, in each molecule. Although griffithsin shares structural homology with many mannose- or N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectins, its reported biological activity against HIV was >1000-fold better than those previously reported for several monosaccharide-specific lectins (Charan et al., 2000). Of those lectins most closely related to griffithsin, only jacalin has been previously reported to exhibit anti-HIV activity (Corbeau et al., 1995). Jacalin was, however, found to be relatively weak in its anti-HIV activity, not reaching an EC50 level at a high dose of 10 \u03bcg/ml (227 nM) (O'Keefe et al., 1997) in the same whole-cell assay system in which griffithsin displayed an EC50 = 43 pM (Mori et al., 2005). The source of this enhanced potency and, presumably, higher affinity for HIV envelope glycoproteins, is of considerable interest. An explanation is suggested from the structure of griffithsin, which offers no less than six separate binding sites for mannose in a compact domain-swapped dimer. The enhanced binding potential for the high-mannose oligosaccharides present on the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 to be gained from this multivalency is significant. The sites on each monomer are much closer than in the lectins that belong to the \u03b2-prism-II family, presumably allowing tighter binding of complex carbohydrates. Similar enhancement was seen in previous studies on the anti-HIV protein cyanovirin-N, which detailed the increased relative binding affinity, due to multivalent interactions, of this domain-swapped dimer for high mannose oligosaccharides (Shenoy et al., 2002). Initial attempts at the crystallization of griffithsin with larger oligosaccharides have shown signs that similar multivalent binding to these carbohydrate structures occurs with griffithsin, leading to rapid precipitation of the complexes (data not shown).",

It was previously speculated that griffithsin, due to its more promiscuous carbohydrate binding, might be active against viruses such as the coronavirus responsible for the recent SARS outbreak (Mori et al., 2005). This prediction was based on the ability of griffithsin to bind a broader spectrum of oligosaccharide structures than other antiviral lectins such as cyanovirin-N (Bolmstedt et al., 2001) and scytovirin (Adams et al., 2004). This prediction has proved to be true as recent data from anti-SARS assays has shown that griffithsin is indeed active against this virus at nanomolar concentrations, while both cyanovirin-N and scytovirin were inactive (data not shown). Whether or not this protein will prove to have any clinical utility as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of viral infections remains to be answered, but its unique structure and interactions with carbohydrates, in addition to its unusual potency against HIV, provide ample justification for continued study.",

However, enzymatic removal of the tag proved to be impractical and thus the crystallized protein consisted of 138 amino acids, rather than the 121 that are present in plant-expressed griffithsin. Isomorphous crystals were grown for both the plant-expressed protein as defined above and for a similarly produced SeMet derivative.",

The latter program built 123 out of 138 residues expected in this construct, with only a single one-residue break at Asn67. That residue as well as one residue each on the N and C termini were added with the program O (Jones and Kjeldgaard, 1997) during subsequent refinement and rebuilding. The structure was refined with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) utilizing data extending to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1). The resulting model contains all 121 residues expected in the structure of authentic griffithsin, as well as additional five residues derived from the N-terminal extension. The rest of the N-terminal extension, including the His-tag, was found to be disordered.",

Crystals belonged to space group P21 (Table 1) and diffracted to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution on the home source described above and to 0.9 \u00c5 on a synchrotron. Full data sets were collected on two crystals of the complex. A complete data set extending to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution was collected on the home source from crystal 1. High-resolution data were collected at the synchrotron to a nominal resolution of 0.9 \u00c5 from crystal 2, but since that crystal suffered from the presence of considerable ice rings, these data were merged with another low-resolution data set collected on crystal 1, this time on the synchrotron. Data from these two crystals were scaled together with HKL2000 package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997), retaining reflections extending only to 0.94 \u00c5. The structure that utilized home data was solved with PHASER (Storoni et al., 2004) by using the orthorhombic structure of unliganded griffithsin and was refined with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997).
