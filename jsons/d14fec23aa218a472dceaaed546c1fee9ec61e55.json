As at 31 December 1994 the international captive population was 1218 animals of which 880 (72'%) were captive-bred and 338 (28%) were wild-caught. The steady increase in the captive population is a result of captive breeding, co-operative captive-management programmes and importation from the wild. Of facilities holding Cheetah 26% (96) have bred the species, 15\"/1, of which have bred continuously producing 63% (n= 1580) of all cubs born in captivity. Although the number of facilities breeding Cheetah has increased, in 1994 only 10'% of them reported successful reproduction. The N, has increased gradually and in 1994 was equivalent to 17% of the captive population. Of 1564 animals that have been imported, c. 20% (n = 308) have reproduced and in 1994 155 have living descendants in the captive population. Except for a few East African Cheetah Acinonyx jubutus ruinryi all of the imported animals are the southern African subspecies Acinonyx jubutus juhutus. There has been an increase in the number of subspecific hybrids in the captive population and between 1990 and 1994 28 hybrids produced 24'X) (190) of cubs.

After the age of 2 years there is a clear demarcation between the age of death for wild-caught animals and captive-bred animals. The combined incidence of infant mortality in captive-born animals between 1956 and 1994 was 21% at 1 month and 28% at 6 6 months of age.

Infant mortality varied widely among institutions (0-100%) and also between years ( Table 2 ). The high incidence of infant mortality may be the result of an ancestral genetic homogenization event that purged large portions of genetic variation from the species (O'Brien et al., 1985 (O'Brien et al., , 1987 Menotti-Raymond & O'Brien, 1993) and captive husbandry problems (Lindburg, 1991; Caro, 1993; Laurenson, 1993; Lindburg et al., 1993) .
