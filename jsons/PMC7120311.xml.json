This pragmatic approach is apparently well adapted to critically ill patients but it nowadays appears as too simple. As evoked in introduction section, in ICU patients, \u201csecondary\u201d chronic PH is frequently observed as a final consequence of chronic diseases as left ventricle failure (post capillary chronic PH), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 1973, primary PH referred to PH with no obvious cardiovascular or pulmonary cause. It was further demonstrated that \u201cprimary\u201d PH was a complex and non-homogeneous group of diseases that could be primary (idiopathic), but also associated with various diseases ranging from connective tissue disease or cirrhosis to drug toxicity or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therefore, the risk of the original classification was to under-diagnose rare causes of PH that needs a specific treatment. Then, a more complex classification was proposed in 1998 (Evian classification [7]) and updated in 2003 (Venice classification [8]) and 2008 (Dana point classification, published in 2009 [5]). The actual classification (Dana point) is shown in Table 1. The three main evolutions of the new classification were (1) to stop the use of primary/secondary HP classification, (2) to separate PH from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), (3) to separate PAH from veno-occlusive pulmonary disease and/or hemagiomatosis [4, 5, 9]. The evolution of clinical classification of PH during the 3 past decades is summarized in Table 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH = Class 1) refers to a heterogeneous group of non-cardiac, non-pulmonary diseases characterized by a chronic PH. The main causes of PAH are: idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, associated (HIV infection, connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, chronic hemolytic anemia) and persistent PH of the newborn. In this classification, pulmonary hypertension refers to a PH due to an obvious pulmonary or cardiac cause. The three mains causes of PH are cardiac (severe congestive left heart failure, Class 2), pulmonary (COPD, Class 3) and thromboembolic (Class 4) (Table 1). A fourth cause of PH is proliferative diseases as hematologic diseases, storage diseases or anatomical obstruction of pulmonary vessels by fibrosis or tumor (Class 5). These four PH classes represent the \u201csecondary\u201d PH of the original classification. Finally, an intermediate class (Class 1\u2032) is a direct pulmonary vessels disease called pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and/or capillary hemangiomatosis. The diagnosis of PVOD may be difficult because since it can mimics left ventricle failure.\n",

            "text": "Pulmonary artery hypertension is characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary artery resistances and chronic right ventricle failure. Chronic right heart failure is the main prognostic factor of PAH. The prevalence is probably underestimated because of the poor specificity of clinical signs. In a population of patients evaluated by echocardiography for dyspnea, the prevalence of PH was about 10 %. On the population of patients with PH echocardiographic signs, about 80 % had left heart failure, 10 % had chronic pulmonary disease and hypoxia, 4 % had PAH, 0.6 % had thromboembolic disease [10]. The prevalence of PAH ranges from 15 to 50/million adult population [11]. Idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is the most common cause of PAH. In a population of patient with documented PAH, 39.2 % of patients has IPAH and 3.9 % had family history of PAH. In the subgroup of associated PAH, 15.3 % had connective tissue disease, 11.3 % had congenital heart disease, 10.4 % had portal hypertension, 9.5 % had anorexigen-associated PAH and 6.2 % had HIV infection [12]. Pulmonary artery hypertension is a severe and insidious disease. The non-specific signs of PAH are associated with a delayed diagnosis that worsens prognosis. Before 2000, there were few specific treatment and few specialized teams for PAH care. At that time, the mean survival time was low (2.8 years following diagnosis) with survival rates of 68, 48, and 34 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively [1]. Since the introduction of specific vasodilators (in particular epoprostenol) and specialized teams, the prognosis significantly improved as the reported survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 87.8, 76.3, and 62.8 % in USA registry and 87, 76 and 67 % in the French registry, respectively [1, 13]. If these results are encouraging, the prognosis remains severe, especially when ICU admission is required. In ICU, the prognostic of PH or PAH is considered as poor but few data are available. Therefore, no strong recommendation for PH or PAH treatment in ICU patients can be done [14, 15]. In a population of 82 septic ICU patients with history of PH mainly due to pulmonary disease, the mortality was related to the severity of PH. In mild, moderate or severe PH, the mortality was 28, 67 and 80 %, respectively [16]. Therefore, in patients with end-stage PH in whom all available treatment options have been exhausted, limitations on advanced treatment and/or ICU admission should be discussed [15].",

As numerous chronic severe diseases, PAH mechanisms are multiple, complex and not well identified [5]. Genetic factors have been identified in PAH. Heritable PAH represents less than 10 % of cases. Heritable PAH is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance. Mutations of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) receptors genes were identified as responsible of heritable but also sporadic cases. In particular, mutations of bone morphogenetic protein recepetor-2 (BMPR2) or activin-like receptor 1 (ALK-1) were shown to be associated with PAH and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, respectively (Class 1, 2, Table 1).

Data obtained from the French national registry published in 2006 shows the following characteristics [12]. The female/male sex ratio is 1.9. The mean age is 50 \u00b1 15 years. Body mass index (BMI) is usually normal. A BMI above 30 is observed in 15 % of the cases, similar to the adult French population. The delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is 27 months. A majority (75 %) of patients had severe symptoms at presentation, with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV (class I = 1 %, class II: 24 %). Exercise capacity is tested through a 6-minute walk test, which was abnormal (329 \u00b1 109 m) in most patients. The six-minute walk distance is correlated with NYHA functional class.",

            "text": "Because patients with PAH admitted in ICU are usually at advanced stage of the disease, echocardiography findings are usually easy to diagnose. The first difficulty is to separate acute from chronic PH. In case of acute PH, sPAP value is rarely more than 40 mm Hg. Above such value, RV cannot compensate acute afterload increase and right cardiac output (CO) decreases. The subsequent low CO limits the sPAP increase, which rarely reaches more than 40\u201345 mm Hg. The consequence of acute RV failure is a rapid (few hours) dilation of RV. As pericardium is not distensible in a short period of time, the biventricular volume is constant. Therefore, the hemodynamic consequence of acute RV dilation is LV compression, which limits LV filling and subsequently worsens low cardiac output. For those reasons, when a sPAP value is more than 40 mm Hg, a chronic PH is likely. In chronic PH, the simplest way to assess sPAP is to record tricuspid regurgitation (TR) flow on a four-chamber apical view (Table 3). The maximal velocity of TR is correlated to the pressure gradient between pulmonary artery and RV (Table 3). This approach can also be applied to pulmonary regurgitation that require a trained operator. Pulmonary regurgitation flow allows evaluation of mean and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (Table 3). The sum of right atrial pressure or central venous pressure (RAP, CVP) value and right ventriculo-arterial gradient represent sPAP (Table 3). Evaluation of RAP value by TTE is summarized in Table 4. A semiquantitative approach of sPAP can be done on the basis of gradient only (Table 3). The acceleration time of pulmonary ejection flow allows a semi-quantitative assessment of sPAP for trained operators when TR is not recordable. (Table 3)\n\n",

The normal value of TAPSE is 16\u201325 mm. A TAPSE value inferior to 15 mm is of poor prognosis [5]. This index represents the maximal anterior systolic displacement of tricuspid annulus. This simple and reproducible index is correlated with RV ejection fraction (RVEF). An analogous method could be applied to tissue Doppler at the lateral tricuspid annulus. The maximal velocity of S (systolic) wave recorded by tissue Doppler at the lateral tricuspid annulus is correlated to RVEF.

This molecule improved the 6-minute walk distance both in patients who were receiving no other treatment for the disease and in those who were receiving endothelin-receptor antagonists or prostanoids. There were significant improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance, NT-proBNP levels, WHO functional class, time to clinical worsening, and dyspnea score [26]. Encouraging results were also recently reported with riociguat in case of thromboembolic PH [27]. In the past, most studies involving the therapies listed in Table 8 were short-term trial with exercise capacity as a primary end point. Macitentan is a new oral dual (ETA and ETB) Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA). Recently, the phase III SERAPHIN trial enrolled a total of 742 patients comparing placebo to Macitentan 3 mg and Macitentan 10 mg in a long-term trial. It is the largest PAH prospective study to date. In this study, Macitentan significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [28].\n",

Low doses (5 mcg/Kg/min) decrease PVR and PAP and moderately increase cardiac output. Higher doses are not recommended as they induce tachycardia without decreasing RVP. Systemic vasodilation is frequently observed in decompensated PH, due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This phenomenon can be worsened by sepsis. Systemic vasodilation is characterized by low diastolic pressure, which is the main determinant of coronary pressure. Therefore, a low diastolic pressure (>40\u201350 mm Hg) [31] may induce functional myocardial ischemia that may worsen RV function. In this case, Norepinephrine is the agent of choice since it induces systemic vasoconstriction without alteration of coronary blood flow. The objective of MAP is classical, 65\u201375 mm Hg [32].
