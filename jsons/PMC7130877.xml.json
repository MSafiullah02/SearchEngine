Unfortunately, year 2018 witnessed six outbreaks of the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens.1\n,\n2 Nipah virus, complicated by the lack of treatment strategies, has the potential to cause an epidemic crisis in the near future. Recent EBOLA crisis has highlighted the need for coordinated and better preparedness to tackle these possible and inevitable public health \u2018tsunamis.\u2019 Pandemic Emergency Finance Facility\u22122017,3 World Bank initiative for expediting funds to the crisis hit countries acknowledge rapid mobilization of resources for effective containment of these outbreaks. Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is another international initiative worth mentioning here.4 It is a collective and colligative effort in the field of expedited vaccine development and distribution. After its formal beginning in 2017 (World Economic Forum meeting, Davos), CEPI has been able to secure significant funding toward its objectives. Their commitment is shown by the fact that they have already invited the proposal for vaccine development pertaining to the WHO priority list, starting with three pathogens: Nipah virus, MERS-CoV, and Lassa virus.",
