            "text": "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory syndrome that resembles pneumonia. The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multiclass classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNet-Large displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures. This article also added the visual explanation to illustrate the basis of model classification and perception of COVID-19 in CXR images.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause severe illness to the human being. The first known severe epidemic is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2003, whereas the second outbreak began in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , began as an outbreak from epicentre Wuhan, Peoples Republic of China in late December 2019, and till April 15, 2020, it caused 1,996,681 infections and 127,590 deaths worldwide [1] . The coronavirus (COVID- 19) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO on January 30, 2020 [2] . On March 11, as the number of COVID-19 cases has increased thirteen times apart from China with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared this a pandemic [3] . Globally, many researchers of medicine, clinical and artificial intelligence areas are trying hard to mobilize preventive action plans for COVID-19 with identified research priorities. Since this disease is highly contagious, the most desirable preventive measure is to identify the infected people to control the spread. Unfortunately, there is no well-known treatment available to cure COVID-19, therefore the identified infected person must be kept in isolation to break the transmission chain as this patient may become the source of community transfer. Till now, the testing kit is the only available option for diagnosis of COVID-19. Unavailability of testing kits due to excessive demand all over the world is a severe problem in the mission against this pandemic. Though several healthcare organizations are claiming for successful development of testing kits, there is a huge gap in demand and supply. The healthcare agencies have accelerated the rate of development of low-cost testing kits, but the inability to diagnose at early-stage and due to exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, medical professionals are bound to rely on other diagnostic measures.",

Although chest CT is a more effective imaging technique for lungrelated disease diagnosis; CXR is preferred because it is widely available, faster and cheaper than CT. Since COVID-19 infection attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, hence X-rays images can be used to analyse the lungs to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes [5] . Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID-19 and distinguish it from other forms of flu and pneumonia is crucial.",

In this area, advancement in computing infrastructure makes it possible to deploy the deep learning techniques for complex medical image analysis tasks. Recent works have shown that the chest X-rays of patients suffering from COVID-19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography [7] . For medical image analysis; deep learning techniques, specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are very effective and efficient in feature extraction and learning, hence becoming the most popular choice among researchers [8] . CNNs have been successfully deployed in the analysis of video endoscopy [9] and CT images, and also used for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia via chest Xray images [10] , [11] . Chouhan et al. [12] proposed a transfer learning based deep network approach pre-trained on ImageNet for pneumonia detection. Xianghong et al. [13] proposed a customized VGG16 model for lung regions identification to classify different types of pneumonia. Later, Ronneburger et al. [14] demonstrated the effectiveness of image augmentation with CNN in the presence of a small set of images. In the area of biomedical image classification, Rajpurkar et al. [15] proposed a dense CNN with 121layers to detect several pathologies including pneumonia using chest Xrays. Lakhani et al. [16] obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 in pneumonia detection using AlexNet and GoogLeNet along with image augmentation. Recently, several deeplearning based COVID19 detection techniques have been proposed [17] , [18] , [19] . Linda et al. [17] introduced a deep CNN, named COVIDNet for the detection of COVID19 cases from the chest Xray images. Shuai et al.

            "text": "Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, many companies at the global level around the world embraced a flurry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solutions to detect COVID-19 on chest X-ray scans. It is evident that deep learning tools are effectively used to screen mild cases, triage new infections, and monitor disease advancements. This way of diagnosis can reduce the growing burden on radiologists, and also supplant standard nucleic acid tests as the primary diagnostic tool for coronavirus infection. It is also reported that a swab test needs isolation for testing procedure whereas chest X-ray based detection can be easily manageable. Kermany et al. [24] proposed CXR image-based deep learning model to detect pneumonia and classify other diseases using different medical datasets with testing accuracy of 92.80%. In another similar research, Stephen et al. [25] illustrated an efficient deep learning approach for pneumonia classification by using four convolutional layers and two dense layers in addition to classical image augmentation and achieved 93.73% testing accuracy. Later, Saraiva et al. [26] experimented convolutional neural networks to classify images of childhood pneumonia by using a deep learning model with seven convolutional layers along with three dense layers while achieving 95.30% testing accuracy. Liang and Zheng [27] demonstrated a transfer learning method with a deep residual network for pediatric pneumonia diagnosis with 49 convolutional layers and two dense layers and achieved 96.70% testing accuracy. In similar research, Wu et al. [28] focused on convolutional deep neural learning networks and random forest to propose a pneumonia prediction using CXR images and achieved 97% testing accuracy.",

This research highlights that the Resnet18 outperformed among other deep transfer models in combination with GAN. Further, Sethy et al.

Deep features from CXR images have been extracted and support vect or machine (SVM) classifier is used to measure accuracy, false positive rate, F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) and kappa. It is found that ResNet50 in combination with SVM is statistically superior when compared to other models. Later, Bukhari et al.

[22] from multiple resources available at public domains without infringing patients confidentiality ( Fig.1(b) ). It is claimed that this dataset can help to identify characteristics of COVID-19 in contrast to other types of pneumonia; therefore it can play a major role in predicting survival rate. The dataset includes the statistics up to March 25, 2020 consisting of 5 types of pneumonia such as SARSr-CoV-2 or COVID-19, SARSr-CoV-1 or SARS, Streptococcus spp., Pneumocystis spp. and ARDS with following attributes: patient ID, offset, sex, age, finding, survival, view, modality, date, location, filename, doi, url, license, clinical notes, and other notes. Another dataset utilized in this study is published under RSNA pneumonia detection challenge is a subset of 30,000 examinations taken from the NIH CXR14 dataset [23] . Out of 30,000 selected images, 15,000 examinations had positive cases of pneumonia and from the remaining 15000 cases, 7500 cases had no findings and other 7500 cases had symptoms other than pneumonia. All these images are annotated by a group of experts including radiologists in two stages. A sample image is shown in Fig.  1(c) . This dataset has been published in two stages. In Stage one, 25,684 training images were considered to test 1,000 images. Later in stage two 1000 testing samples were added to the training set to form the dataset of 26,684 training images and a new set of 3,000 radiographs were introduced for the test.",

Later, this base model was refined by introducing the batch normalization and established as the inception-v2 [41] . In further iterations, additional factorisation was introduced and released as the inception-v3. It is one of the pre-trained models to perform two types of specific tasks: dimensionality reduction using CNN and classification using fully-connected and softmax layers. Since it is originally trained on over a million images consisting of 1,000 classes of ImageNet, its head layers can be retrained for the generated dataset using historical knowledge to reduce the extensive training and computational power. Later, Inception-ResNet-v2 was proposed by Szegedy et al. [42] . This hybrid model is a combination of residual connections and a recent version of Inception architecture. It is intended to train very deep convolutional models by the additive merging of signals, both for image recognition and object detection.

It works on the concept of reuse, in which each layer receives inputs from all previous layers and yields a condensed model to pass its own feature-maps to all subsequent layers. This makes the network thinner and compact with the fewer number of channels, while improving variation in the input of subsequent layers, and becomes easy to train and highly parameter efficient. Google Brain research team proposed NAS-Net model based on reinforcement learning search methods [44] . It creates search space by factoring the network into cells and further dividing it into a number of blocks. Each block is supported by a set of popular operations in CNN models with various kernel size e.g: convolutions, max pooling, average pooling, dilated convolution, depth-wise separable convolutions etc. In this article, the trials of training the deep learning classification models, initiates with the baseline residual network that is composed of five residual blocks [52] , defined by two convolutions whose rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation is concatenated with the input of the first convolution layer, followed by max-pooling and instance normalization, except the final output layer which uses softmax activation function. Later, transfer learning is utilized on the state-of-the-art architectures discussed in Table 2 to utilize the pre-trained models while fine tuning the head layers to serve the purpose of classifying the COVID-19 samples, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . This follows by enabling the four head layers of the network to adjust its trainable parameters along with the addition of fully connected layers, accompanied with the softmax activation function at the output or decision layer.

For instance, fine-tuned NASNetLarge architecture is considered to generate LIME explanations for some samples taken from the test set, whereas class activation maps tend to present the patterns learned by the model for classification of samples as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 8 presents the LIME technique applied to three samples belonging to three distinct classes as COVID-19, other types of pneumonia, and normal cases.

Each trained model was evaluated using benchmark performance metrics e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, area under curve, speci- ficity, and F1 score under four different scenarios concerned with imbalanced learning and classification strategy. With extensive trials, it was observed that models achieve different scores in different scenarios, among which NASNetLarge displayed better performance. The visual representation based on local interpretable model agnostic explanations is utilized to understand the basis of prediction of the model. As an extension to this work more deep learning models and preprocessing techniques can be explored to achieve better results.",
