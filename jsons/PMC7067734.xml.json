Observational studies found that adrenaline was effective at achieving a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short term survival, but there was uncertainty about its effects on long-term survival and survival with a favourable neurological outcome [2]. The PARAMEDIC2 study was a large randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial which evaluated the effect of standard dose adrenaline (1 mg every 3\u20135 min) in adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [3]. The trial found that adrenaline increased ROSC and survival to 30 days/hospital discharge but did not find evidence of improved survival with a favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge.",

One possible explanation for the failure of adrenaline to improve neurological outcomes may be if treatment is administered too late after the onset of cardiac arrest. This hypothesis is supported by animal studies [6\u20138] and observational studies of cardiac arrest both in- and out-of-hospital [9, 10], which suggest better outcomes the earlier that adrenaline is administered. However, the findings of observational studies need to be interpreted with caution because of likely confounding. Resuscitation time bias occurs when interventions are given during the treatment of cardiac arrest (e.g. tracheal intubation, drug administration) [11]. As outcomes are worse the longer the duration of a cardiac arrest, late administration of the intervention is biased by the fact that the duration of cardiac arrest has been longer.",

Trial packs and their contents were identical in appearance and carried a unique identification number. In all other respects identical paramedic resuscitation protocols were followed [13].",

The adjusted analyses were corrected for pre-specified covariates [12] which included age, gender, aetiology (medical, traumatic, drowning, drug overdose, electrocution, asphyxial), initial rhythm (VF, pulseless VT, AED shockable, asystole, PEA/EMD, bradycardia, AED non-shockable), witness type (EMS, bystander) and bystander CPR (yes, no). For the adjusted models, initially, multivariable fractional polynomial models were fitted to determine best fit of model, as there was no reason to assume a constant proportional change in the odds ratio over time. Three transformations of the time variable were assessed: linear, first and second degree power transformations (e.g. time, timea and timea + timeb, respectively, where a and b are powers). Model fits were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). The smallest AIC indicated the best fit model. In the case of the linear model being the best fit model, the treatment effects over time were further assessed using logistic regression. The risk difference represents the difference averaged over time in the incidence of the outcome between the two interventions (having adjusted out the effect of the important covariates).",

This underlies the phenomenon known as resuscitation time bias, whereby interventions given early after the onset of cardiac arrest appear to be beneficial relative to late interventions, but the better outcomes are in fact related to earlier treatment [11, 19]. The randomised design of the PARAMEDIC2 study removes the influence of resuscitation time bias, allowing an unbiased assessment of changes in treatment effect over time. The study reaffirms that during cardiac arrest, any traditional time-to intervention analyses are likely to be severely biased. It highlights the importance of more sophisticated statistical analyses of observational data which can partly deal with this problem [11, 20].",

In a rat model of cardiac arrest Angelos et al. found no difference between placebo and adrenaline in the rate of ROSC in cardiac arrests of very short duration (less than 2 min) [21]. As the duration of cardiac arrest increased, adrenaline played an increasingly important role in restoring ROSC. These findings are consistent with the 3-phase cardiac arrest model described by Weisfeldt and Becker which reflects the time sensitive changes in metabolic and physiological profiles the longer the duration of a cardiac arrest. In this model, vasopressors are recommended during the later circulatory and metabolic phases (> 4 min) [22]. At a cellular level this can be explained as within minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest, myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels decrease, leading to the disruption of normal myocardial cellular homeostasis [6]. Unlike the heart, the brain is more sensitive to tissue ischaemia as it has no myoglobin oxygen stores [23, 24]. Furthermore, CPR and vasopressors may be less effective at restoring mitochondrial function in the brain than it is at restoring cardiac mitochondrial performance [25].",

This is longer than the interval during in-hospital cardiac arrest (average 3 min) [9, 10] and during the majority of animal cardiac arrest models (average 9.5 min) [26]. The timing is similar to a systematic review of time to drug administration across 17 studies [19.4 min (95% CI 12.8\u201325.9)] [27] and with more recent studies (range 13\u201324 min) [28\u201331]. This analysis of time to treatment shows that the shorter the time to treatment, whether treatment was adrenaline or placebo, is associated with the best outcomes. Current treatment algorithms recommend that CPR is started (and if indicated defibrillation) before adrenaline is administered. This finding is, therefore, probably related to a shorter duration of low or no flow time after the onset of cardiac arrest. The later administration of adrenaline increases the chances of ROSC relative to placebo but without incremental improvement in longer term outcomes. This discordance may in part explain improved ROSC, but smaller effects on long-term survival and minimal influence on favourable neurological outcome.",

Hayashi noted both improved survival and better neurological outcomes in those who received adrenaline within 10 min of cardiac arrest [32]. The present study suggests that very early adrenaline does not increase the rates of ROSC in patients with an initially shockable rhythm.",

The pragmatic nature of the trial, embedded within National Health Service Ambulance Services, increased generalisability to similar settings. Although defined a priori, analysis of time to drug administration was not the primary intent of the PARAMEDIC2 study. As such, the results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. The study pooled EMS-witnessed and bystander witnessed cardiac arrests as there were insufficient numbers to analyse separately. For the sub-group analysis according to rhythm, patients were analysed in groups according to their initial presenting rhythm. This does not account for any subsequent rhythm transitions. The relatively few patients with an initial shockable mean the findings need to be interpreted cautiously. Post-resuscitation care treatments (targeted temperature management, haemodynamic and ventilator management, percutaneous coronary intervention, prognostication) were recommended but were not strictly protocolised or monitored. It is possible that different approaches to post-resuscitation care may have influenced longer term outcomes. Alternative dosing regimens such as higher or lower doses, use of a continuous infusion, may have produced different results. Finally, the findings of worse outcomes overall with later interventions should be considered when designing and estimating sample sizes in future trials.",
