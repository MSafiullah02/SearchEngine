We investigated the dynamics of virion movement from a medium toward the interior of insect cells and established a mechanistic model that shows an excellent fit to experimental results. It also makes possible a description of the viral dynamics on the cell surface. A novel measurement method was used to distinguish between infected cells that carry virions on their surfaces, cells that carry virions in their interior, and those carrying virions both inside and on their surface. The maximum number of virions carried by a cell: 55 viruses/cell, and the time required for viral internalization, 0.8 \u210e , are reported. This information is particularly useful for assessing the infection efficacy and the required number of virions needed to infect a given cell population. Although our model specifically concerns the infection process of Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus, it describes general features of viral infection. Some of the model features may eventually be applicable in the studies towards palliation of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "The baculovirus (BV) expression vector system (BEVS) is of great interest for the production of recombinant proteins in a wide range of fields-from basic science research to the development of biomedical applications and the production of bio-insecticides [1] [2] [3] [4] . The production of recombinant proteins in BEVS is greatly affected by the characteristics and kinetics of the viral infection process-including, for instance, the multiplicity of infection (MOI), time of infection (TOI), cell cycle, cell line selection, and culture state [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , but the early events of viral infection, such as the attachment of virions to their receptors and the kinetics of their entry into the cell, are still not entirely understood. This gap hampers the development of efficient and specific genetically engineered proteins and gene therapy vectors based on BVa goal that has lately gained much interest [1] [2] [3] [4] 8] . Since baculovirus was used for efficient gene transfer to mammalian cells in the 1990s [16] [17] , several effective baculovirus-based gene therapy vectors had been created and tested, demonstrating favorable therapeutic efficacy in laboratory and preclinical phase studies [18] [19] [20] [21] . Although the entry processes and the mechanisms involving BVs infection of insect cells or transduction of mammalian cells remain poorly understood, it has been shown that a similar mechanism may mediate GP64 binding to permissive host cells [22] [23] [24] and that BVs enter insect and mammalian cells through a clathrin-mediated endocytosis [25] [26] . Thus, comprehensively characterizing the kinetics underlying the early steps of BVs infection of insect cells is crucial both for improving the production of recombinant proteins in insect cells and for designing therapy vectors and enhancing gene transduction efficacy in therapeutic studies.",

It also does not address the effectiveness of infection, which may vary depending on the elapsed storage time, mainly due to viral aggregation within the viral stocks [31, 32] . As we used the same storage time in all experiments, particle aggregation did not affect the measured results. Consequently, we disregarded storage time in our model. Based on detailed and accurate measurements, our model enhances our understanding of the early BV infection process and can be potentially extended to describe the early stages of other infection processes, such as gene delivery by viruses in mammalian cells. It also provides a basis for modelling the production of foreign proteins. The present model is a first step towards the longterm goal of establishing a more elaborated model of the production process, aimed at saving time, manpower, and physical resources.",

Since the internalization time for each specific virus-host system is expected to be a characteristic constant, it seems that viral vectors with shorter internalization times would have some advantages in gene therapy, since they enter host cells more rapidly while the cells are robust. Therefore, the estimation of the internalization time for any potential virus-host combinations may be very important.

Two types of measurements were done on each sample, rendering different readings.Figure 2shows diagrammatically which cells are detected in each reading. AcV1, conjugated with a fluorescent PE AcV1-PE), was used specifically against the GP64 envelope glycoprotein of the BVs, thereby labeling attached and, in the case of permeabilized cells, internalized viruses[44]. The infected cells were then distinguished from uninfected cells using FCM analysis. A cell was considered \"infected\" once the first virion attached to its surface. Thus, we identified infected cells by their high antibody fluorescence, while all other cells were considered to be uninfected (and are not distinguishable from the \"dark cells\" described in the text). The results of the FCM measurements of the concentrations of infected cells were analyzed by CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CABD) and interpreted using the subtraction method[45].The samples were taken along time from cultures infected with MOIs of 114, 219, or 421 BVs/cell (see \"Infection\" above), and these samples were placed into 5-mL tubes by centrifugation (5 min at 1200 rpm).

The results for , which are within the range of time usually observed in cell infection processes, confirm our assumption that can be related to as a constant. The fact that all examined MOIs render the same indicates that the internalization process is a property dependent on biological processes occurring on the cell surface and in its interior regardless of the virus concentration in the medium.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the monoclonal antibody AcV1 is used to label GP64 in order to distinguish between infected and uninfected cells at different stages of virion attachment/internalization using FCM. We used MOIs of 114, 219, and 421. The maximum number of virions that can attach to a cell, N, which is crucial for planning a highMOI process, was evaluated for Autographa californica and found to be 55. In general, N is a significant reference for investigating the required dosage of the viruses in gene therapy schemes. The virus-host dependent constant is an important characteristic of the internalization process. Some variables, such as , and ( ), in our model have great significance in describing the kinetics of processes like protein production and gene therapy by baculovirus vectors. The mathematical solution of our model shows a satisfactory fit to the experimental measurements of virion removal from the medium and the concentration profiles of the infected cells and explains the dynamics of first stage in cell infection. An FCM-mediated comparison of the infection dynamics with and without cell permeabilization enabled us to distinguish between the rate of virion attachment and the rate of internalization. We mathematically obtained an adequate approximation of the dynamic behavior of the virions on the surface of the cells and presented their transit rate profiles. A simplifying approximation of a constant cell concentration allowed us to obtain a closed-form solution for the profile of attached virions, which may be used to render a considerable simplification in the calculations. The proposed mechanistic approach may inspire modeling of other virus-cell systems independent of infection efficiency.

For suspension cultures, the Sf9 cells were incubated at 100 rpm in triplicate in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 60 mL of cell suspension and supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Pluronic F-68 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Wild-type Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (wt AcMNPV, CCTCC GDV114) was kindly provided by Professor Qi Yipeng (Wuhan University, China). Cells from the T-flasks were transferred to suspension cultures in Erlenmeyer flasks to decrease the lag phase in subsequent stages. When the cells in the pre-culture of the first Erlenmeyer flask reached the late exponential phase (after approximately 96\u210e, depending on the initial cell density), the cultures were transferred to 12 Erlenmeyer flasks (control, i.e., mock-infected, and three different MOIs, all in triplicates) and diluted with fresh medium to a cell concentration of approximately 1.2\u00d710 6 cells/mL. After 12\u210e, these new cell cultures were considered to be in their early exponential phases, reaching a density of approximately 1.7\u00d710 6 cells/mL. At this point, the cultures were infected with MOIs of 114, 219, or 421 BVs per cell.",

In our experimental results we found a small difference between the three MOIs, with a standard deviation lower than 5% for a mean N of 55, which may be considered as experimentally acceptable. Thus, we suggest using =55 for Autographa californica at any MOI. When this model is applied to anti-tumor therapy with baculovirus vectors, N would be the basis for calculating the upper limit of viral concentration required to deliver a foreign gene to target cells. The optimal dosage per cell should be between zero and N. The desired dose per cell (MOI) can be defined as that which maximizes the expectancy of treated cells with minimal costs.",
