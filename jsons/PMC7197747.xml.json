            "text": "In recent years, viruses have been increasingly recognized as an important cause of foodborne diseases. The viruses most frequently reported as involved in foodborne outbreaks are the human noroviruses (NoVs) and hepatitis A virus (Friesema et al. 2009; Koopmans 2009; Westrell et al. 2010). Other viruses such as rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, astrovirus, Aichi virus, sapovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and adenovirus can also be transmitted by food, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the list of foodborne viruses may be even longer (Greening 2006; Duizer and Koopmans 2008; FAO/WHO 2008). Most recognized viruses transmitted by foods are nonenveloped small spheres (around 30 nm in diameter) with single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA genomes. The primary mode of transmission is person\u2010to\u2010person spread, but indirect transmission via faecally contaminated food is common.",

These viruses represent different families that are shed via faeces or respiratory secretions and because of this, might ultimately contaminate foods via food handler related contamination. Only, human NoV and poliovirus have been confirmed to be transmitted by foods and/or water. Foodborne transmission of adenoviruses is considered likely (Duizer and Koopmans 2008) and the serotype 5 strain is interesting because it can be detected in respiratory excretions as well as faeces and has a different genome structure than the small RNA viruses (Rosario et al. 2006). Adenovirus is a nonenveloped virus, approximately 80 nm in diameter with a double\u2010stranded DNA genome. We also evaluated the thermal stability of parechovirus, which causes a mild gastrointestinal illness in young children (Benschop et al. 2008).",

As the oropharynx is a common replication site for many respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (Lieberman et al. 2009) infection resulting from ingestion, while not considered likely, cannot be excluded. Furthermore, a relatively high thermostability for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses has been shown (Thomas and Swayne 2007) and foodborne transmission has been suggested (Duizer and Koopmans 2008). However, influenza A viruses are much larger (around 300 nm), do have an envelope and a different genome (negative strands RNA) than the common foodborne viruses. Temperatures of 56 and 73\u00b0C for different time intervals were evaluated because these are commonly used in cooking and pasteurization processes (Cannon et al. 2006; Isbarn et al. 2007).",

The simplest reduction pattern involves a constant reduction rate, with a log\u2010linear decrease in virus numbers (i.e. monophasic reduction) (Chick 1908). Alternatively, the initial population of viruses in the sample can consist of several viral fractions and/or several different experimental circumstances, with each fraction displaying a particular reduction rate. For example, when two such rates are observed, then the reduction is biphasic (de Roda Husman et al. 2009). Alternatively, the reduction rate(s) need not be constant over time, but may continuously change under progressing treatment. This situation is modelled with the Weibull model (van Boekel 2002). By applying statistical modelling, hypothesis can be tested regarding constant or variable inactivation rates or the presence of mixture virus populations to support data interpretation in terms of intervention measures.",

Models (2) and (3) are non\u2010nested, and therefore, model selection was based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Parameter values were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the respective models. Zero\u2010counts were included as censored observations, with contributions to the total likelihood based on the cumulative density function using a detection limit of a single infectious virus. Parameter uncertainty was assessed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling using the Metropolis and Hastings algorithm (Gilks et al. 1996). The time to the first log10 reduction (TFL\u2010value) was estimated by solving t from Eqns. (1\u20133) using the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters.

TFL\u2010values at 73\u00b0C ranked (from highest to lowest) as MNV1 > influenza A (H1N1) virus > adenovirus type 5 > parechovirus 1 > poliovirus Sabin 1 and varied between 14 s for poliovirus Sabin 1 to 64 s for MNV1. Based on infectivity reduction after 3 min at 73\u00b0C in DMEM, thermal stability of the tested viruses rank as parechovirus 1 > MNV1 > influenza A (H1N1) virus > adenovirus type 5 > poliovirus Sabin 1 with nearly 4 log10 reduction for parechovirus 1 to complete inactivation (>4 log10 reduction) for all the other tested viruses (Fig. 1c).",

In our comparisons, we assumed that TFL reduction values represent the inactivation of the most sensitive viral fraction in the suspension, that is, the monodispersed fraction. Based on TFL reduction values at 56\u00b0C, the two representatives of the Picornaviridae (poliovirus and parechovirus) showed very different thermostabilities, while the nonenveloped adenovirus was less thermostable than the enveloped and larger influenza virus. The relatively high thermal stability of highly pathogenic influenza virus has been previously reported for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (Thomas and Swayne 2007) and may thus be an important characteristic of influenza A viruses in general. Additionally, a recent study (Sauerbrei and Wutzler 2009) also showed that the reduction in poliovirus Sabin 1 by heat (dry) was faster than that of the enveloped bovine viral diarrhoea virus and vaccinia virus. These results suggest that the viral envelope may have less impact on thermal stability of viruses than previously thought (Richards 1999; Baert et al. 2008; Sauerbrei and Wutzler 2009). This suggests that some enveloped viruses may remain infectious throughout the food chain if only mild heat treatment is performed.",

Parechovirus is a recently discovered virus of the family Picronaviridae and found to be associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory syndromes similar to human enteroviruses (Stanway and Hyypia 1999; van der Sanden et al. 2008). The monodispersed virus fraction showed the highest thermostability of the viruses tested at 56\u00b0C, a relatively rapid reduction in a large fraction of the virus at 73\u00b0C, but inactivation was still incomplete after 3 min at 73\u00b0C (Fig. 1a,c), indicating the potential presence of a highly stable fraction. For parechovirus, we found that limited reductions in infectious viruses were concomitant with relatively high reductions in RT\u2010PCRU. This might suggest that the RNA of the large fraction of noninfectious viruses, as present in all viral stocks (Jaykus 1997), is more sensitive to breakdown than the RNA of infectious viruses. Overall, parechovirus was the most thermostable of all viruses tested. While its transmission by foodborne routes has not yet been reported, the fact that they are shed in faeces, replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and are relatively heat stable warrants further investigation of their role in foodborne illness.",

When enteric viruses are found on foods, it is usually the result of faecal contamination. This low level of contamination was chosen because we expected that by adding 1% stool the levels of viral aggregation would already increase significantly, thereby decreasing the magnitude of the most sensitive (monodispersed) viral fraction. Additionally, very low levels of interfering substances have been shown to have a profound impact on chemical inactivation of viruses in suspensions (Young and Sharp 1977; Mattle et al. 2011). In most cases in our study, the TFL\u2010values were not significantly affected by the presence of 1% stool, which is consistent with the assumption that TFL\u2010values represent the inactivation of the most sensitive (monodispersed) virus fraction. Apparently, 1% stool in suspension is not enough to cause aggregation of such a large fraction (>90%) of the viruses that the TFL is affected. Overall, we conclude that 1% stool is not a significant interfering substance for assessing the thermo stabilities of the viruses we tested.",

At 56\u00b0C, the time\u2010dependent reduction in the nonenveloped viruses was best modelled using the Weibull model. Most of the data for the 73\u00b0C showed monophasic inactivation kinetics, although two of the nine virus condition combinations demonstrated nonmonophasic kinetics. When inactivation occurs in two or more phases, as is suggested by the biphasic and Weibull models, viral infectivity loss is not constant over time, but rather changes under progressing treatment. At 56\u00b0C, the shape of the inactivation curves for adenovirus, poliovirus and MNV1 were characterized by a rapid initial drop in the infectivity, followed by tailing caused by diminishing reduction rates as time increased (Fig. 1a,b; P < 1 Table 1). On the other hand, a shoulder was observed for parechovirus at 56\u00b0C and MNV at 73\u00b0C (P > 1). The presence of tails and shoulders (and hence biphasic inactivation kinetics) tends to indicate the presence of viral fractions having different native thermal stability. The most likely cause of this phenomenon would be that some of the viral suspension presents itself as single or monodispersed virions, while other parts of the suspension consist of aggregated viruses. The monodispersed fraction would be considered more heat labile and should theoretically show monophasic (log linear) reduction. On the other hand, the aggregated virus fraction will display a higher thermostability, depending upon the degree of aggregation, among other factors. This phenomenon has been described for MS2 bacteriophage (Langlet et al. 2007). Interestingly, for the enveloped influenza A (H1N1) virus, a monophasic model provided the best fit at both 56 and 73\u00b0C, indicating the constant rate of reduction over time and apparent limited heterogeneity of viral fractions.",
