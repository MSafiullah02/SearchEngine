The caller, so concerned about her mother\u2019s health, had failed to notice she herself had a fever and cough for the past few days. Her mother\u2019s symptoms sounded stable, I assured her, but her own condition was dangerous. I pleaded for her to go to the emergency room for evaluation for breathing support. As she agreed and disconnected, I went on to the next caller.",

Many of the tools we have traditionally used to \u201csupport breathing\u201d have been limited in supply, and even when available, BIPAP, CPAP, and HFNC are all considered to be highly aerosolizing procedures to be limited in use as they put others at risk for contracting COVID. Without these options, we are often left with two extremes: nasal cannula and non-rebreather facemasks versus intubation.",

While intubation has its clear benefits of prolonging life, especially in scenarios with reversible illness, it has significant risks that we rarely talk about with our patients. It is difficult to discuss the possible long-term consequences of intubation because frankly we cannot predict if these complications will occur for each patient. We do not know who will require increased pressures or FiO2, resulting in sustained lung injuries. We do not know who will breathe asynchronously with the ventilator, thus requiring increasing doses of sedatives. We do not know who will simply die from their underlying illness, despite mechanical ventilation. We do not know who will survive to extubation, only to ultimately succumb to pneumonia or urosepsis while undergoing rehabilitation. All of these unknowns often result in doctors uncomfortable in talking about risks and benefits of intubation with their patients until it is clear that the patient has progressed to a point of needing respiratory support. And there is, inherently, never a right moment to have this conversation.",

Patients often require a prolonged intubation of 10\u201314 days, and patients who are older, have cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), diabetes, or malignancy have worse outcomes.1, 2 Evidence from the China CDC shows that in Wuhan, 49% of critically ill patients died.2 Looking specifically at those intubated, data published from China shows small numbers of intubations with alarming mortality rates. Yang et al. show a mortality rate of 19 out of 21 intubated patients.3 Zhou et al. show 31 of 32 intubated patients dying prior to discharge.1 In the largest study by Guan et al., all 25 intubated patients died.4 For many in the United States, patients who have died while intubated have been alone and without visitors.5 For those that do survive, the risk of cachexia and a prolonged recovery is almost inevitable.",
