            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and diarrhoea are the most common and economically important diseases in calves. Various micro-organisms have been shown to be involved in BRD together with predisposing factors (van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2000, Thomas et al., 2002, H\u00e4rtel et al., 2004, H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006). The most important viral agents are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine corona virus (BCV), bovine adenovirus (BAV) and bovine herpes virus 1, the causative agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Finland is free of IBR (Nuotio et al., 2006) and BVD is very rare (Rikula et al., 2005). Thus far, Mycoplasma bovis has not been detected in Finnish cattle, and the last case of bovine tuberculosis (M. bovis) occurred in 1982. Moreover, prophylactic use of antibiotics is rare. Diseased animals are mostly treated individually, although a vaccine containing killed RSV, PIV3 and Mannheimia haemolytica was introduced after this study. This favourable disease situation provides excellent possibilities for investigating the epidemiology of certain respiratory pathogens in calves.",

A limited number of reports exist describing the etiology of BRD in all-in all-out calf-rearing units. There is also a shortage of knowledge of co-occurrence of bacteria, mycoplasmas and viruses in other than autopsied calves. Rearing of coeval calves in large groups in an all-in all-out system has increased during the last few years in Finland. Calves originating from several dairy farms are transported into a specialized calf-rearing unit at 1\u20133 weeks of age. There they are housed in group pens typically containing 20\u201350 calves. At the age of 3.5\u20135.5 months, the entire group is moved into a specialized beef-rearing unit. The all-in all-out system enables efficient cleaning and disinfection procedures between rearing groups. On the other hand, mixing of calves from different farms exposes the animals to a heavy infection load, including microbes to which their dams do not have colostral antibodies. BRD is the most common and severe disease in calf-rearing herds.",

Both conventional bacteriological methods and PCR detection were used to detect bacterial pathogens, including mycoplasmas (M. bovis, M. bovirhinis, M. dispar) and Ureaplasma diversum, and PCR detection was used for viruses (RSV, PIV3, BAV, BCV) in the lower respiratory tract. In addition, serological diagnostics was possible since this study was conducted prior to the introduction of a killed vaccine against a subset of bovine respiratory pathogens.",

The units were compartmentalized and the incoming air was taken from an outdoor or an animal-free area. The median herd size in the compartments was 36.5 (range 13\u201380) calves. The calves were housed in large group pens of 9\u201351 (median 26.5) calves. The calves were fed with milk replacement either ad libitum by artificial teats (24 herds) or by an automatic milk-feeding system (16 herds). Acidified milk replacement was used in 32 herds.

M. bovis was not found in this study, has never been isolated in the Finnish cattle population, and mastitis caused by M. bovis has not been reported in Finland. In a herd with endemic pneumonia every other 5-day-old dairy calf has been shown to shed mycoplasma (Stipkovits et al., 2001), and infected cattle can shed mycoplasma via the respiratory tract for months or even years (Nicholas and Ayling, 2003).

These findings support the opinion that P. multocida be classified as an opportunistic pathogen. Although commonly isolated, it is not considered to be a primary causative agent of respiratory disease in calves (Maheswaran et al., 2002). However, knowledge of the pathogenesis and level of genetic diversity of bovine P. multocida isolates is scant. Davies et al. (2004) found only limited genetic diversity among bovine P. multocida isolates originating mainly from clinical cases of pneumonia and mastitis. They suggested that the small number of P. multocida clones containing the majority of isolates have increased capacity to cause disease. We detected P. multocida in 26% of TBL samples from calves without clinical signs of respiratory disease. It would be interesting to analyse the genetic similarity of P. multocida isolates from TBL samples of healthy and pneumonic calves.",

H. somni has not been an uncommon finding in autopsied pneumonic calves in rearing herds in Finland during the last 5 years. These cases, however, have represented fatal respiratory disease, which was rarely seen in our study, explaining the low prevalence of H. somni observed.",

Maternal antibodies may persist for months and their decline depends on many factors, e.g. infectious pressure (Kimman et al., 1987, van der Poel et al., 1999, Fulton et al., 2004; Step et al., 2005). Commercial antibody ELISAs detect mainly IgG1 antibodies, which compose the majority of maternally derived antibodies in calves. In case of BCV, RSV and PIV3, the change in OD values of paired samples was statistically higher in calves with PCR-positive TBL samples than in PCR-negative calves. Significant rises in OD values were seen even though the primary samples were positive according to the cut-off value set by the manufacturer. For this reason, a two-fold rise in OD values was defined as seroconversion in cases where already the first sample was positive. For example, in a herd with one animal shedding RSV, all animals were seropositive for RSV in the first sampling. In the second sampling, four animals had a significant rise and others only a minor change in the OD value.",

Maternal antibodies are known to suppress the humoral response to RSV (Kimman et al., 1987, Uttenthal et al., 2000). This phenomenon was seen in some of the herds. For instance, in a herd where four animals shed RSV, nine animals were seropositive and only one seronegative in the first sampling. In the second sampling, the only seronegative animal seroconverted, and OD values decreased for other animals, one animal becoming seronegative. However, in the majority of herds, seroconversion was observed in several calves. In conclusion, paired samples from several calves should be tested by serology to obtain reliable results of infection status of a single calf-rearing herd. The benefits of PCR include its speed and the ease of interpreting results. However, the virus secretion period is often short, which makes optimal sampling time crucial.",

(2000) found using antigen capture ELISA that 7.3% of feedlot cattle shed BCV via the respiratory tract. Much higher overall shedding rates in feedlots have been observed: 84% nasal and 96% faecal shedding using RT-PCR (Hasoksuz et al., 2002), and 46% and 52%, respectively, using antigen capture ELISA (Cho et al., 2001a). The shedding rates changed over time; shedding peak occurred on day 4 post-arrival and shedding ceased by day 21 (Cho et al., 2001b, Hasoksuz et al., 2002). However, little is known about shedding rates in calves. In experimental infection, BCV could be detected by RT-PCR in nasal samples taken 3\u20134 days post-infection, and the shedding lasted for 2\u201310 days (Cho et al., 2001a, Cho et al., 2001b). The sampling time seems to be critical for the detection of virus, since nine herds were defined as infected according to serological findings, but no virus was detected by PCR. The shedding of BCV in faeces was found in four herds without respiratory shedding or seroconversion in the herd. Faecal shedding of BCV in calves with no clinical signs of diarrhoea should be investigated since subclinically infected animals are a possible source of exposure for uninfected animals.",
