Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, even under optimal conditions of critical care. It is the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units1. The hospital case-fatality rate of severe sepsis patients has been estimated at approximately 25%, while close to 50% of septic shock patients die2. Most importantly, the incidence of sepsis has risen by nearly 30% in the past decade3. Because sepsis can be induced by different microorganisms, vaccine development is difficult to impossible. Moreover, the abuse of antibiotics in the hospital setting has induced drug resistance in common pathogens. Therefore, despite enormous advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis, drug treatment remains largely ineffective. The identification, validation, and development of more effective drug treatments is extremely important.",

Gram-negative bacteria are the leading cause of infection in both hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, and is itself the biggest player in induction of this antibacterial immune response7. LPS induces inflammation by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 on the host cell surface. Upon activation of this receptor, the adaptor protein MyD88 is recruited to the receptor, which in turn triggers a cascade of signaling events that leads to the transcription of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. A subsequent series of downstream pro-inflammatory reactions leads to the expression of cytokines, chemokines, stress-responsive proteins, and other inflammatory elements8.",

Furthermore, studies have shown that rolipram markedly restrains carrageenan-induced acute inflammatory responses in mice13. Both human and animal experiments have shown that rolipram is also an effective antidepressant, indicating significant bioavailability and effectiveness in the blood14,15. However, rolipram has never been studied as a sepsis treatment. We therefore hypothesized, based on preliminary results, that rolipram may protect mice from E. coli induced septic shock and E. coli derived LPS resultant massive inflammatory response. Our findings indicate that rolipram may protect mice from sepsis and septic shock-like symptoms induced by E. coli, CLP, or E. coli derived LPS, through inhibition of the NF-\u03baB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. Rolipram is already approved and in use for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in the United States. As a result, if rolipram is shown to be a viable sepsis treatment in future experiments, significant time and money that would otherwise be spent on the drug-discovery process may be avoided altogether.",

First, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with rolipram or vehicle 6 hr before E. coli injection. In the absence of rolipram, 62% of infected mice died within 60 hr of E. coli injection (Fig. 1A). In contrast, injection with rolipram resulted in 15% mortality over 7 days, suggesting that rolipram pretreatment can prevent E. coli -induced septic shock in mice. Pretreat the CLP model mice can also significant improve the mice survival rate, from 44% to 69% (Fig. 1B). To confirm the protective effect of rolipram both in E. coli-induced and CLP-induced septic mice, we assessed the role of rolipram in mouse sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from E. coli. Mice were i.p. injected with rolipram 1 hr before LPS injection. In the absence of rolipram, 73% of endotoxic mice died within 48 hr of LPS injection, but 100% mice survival in the rolipram pretreated group (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that rolipram may have a protective effect in sepsis.",

Renal tissue H&E staining (Fig. 4B) clearly showed normal structure and morphology in glomeruli, renal tubules, and renal tubular epithelial cells in control mice.

Rolipram inhibited levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT), creatinine (Cr), and brain natriuretic peptide (BUN) in serum.

            "text": "Sepsis is induced by a dysregulated innate immune reaction, leading to a harmful host response to pathogens. This is includes excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b216,17, as well as other inflammatory mediators. These molecules can in turn trigger secondary inflammatory processes, leading to inflammatory pathology and life-threatening organ damage. Proteins that induce the migration of inflammatory cells into tissue are also upregulated. We have found that rolipram inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by the administration of LPS, leading to the suppression of excessive inflammatory responses, cell adhesion and migration, and the further sequelae of shock and multiple organ failure in the mouse host. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction and injury are the main mechanisms of patient shock and death. Therefore, sepsis treatment guidelines consider multi-organ dysfunction a key point of attack in sepsis treatment18. It has previously been reported that rolipram significantly decreased hyperoxia-induced neutrophil numbers in BALF and inhibits IL-6 and MCP-1 transcription in rat lungs19. Rolipram also alleviates pulmonary edema and reduces neutrophil numbers in BALF during chlorine-induced mouse shock20. Our results go further in showing that rolipram inhibits pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration in alveoli, and protein concentrations and neutrophil numbers in BALF. Liver and kidney function is also improved, indicating that rolipram can prevent LPS-induced multi-organ failure. The exact mechanism by which rolipram controls the inflammatory cascade, thereby preventing shock and multiple organ failure in the host, is unknown. However, it is known that the NF-\u03baB pathway is crucial in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression. Nuclear translocation activates the transcription and expression of a variety of cytokines and adhesion molecules, all of which are closely associated with inflammation and the immune response21. The NF-\u03baB family, including p65 (RelA), p50/p105 (NF-\u03baB1), p52/p100 (NF-\u03baB2), RelB, and c-Rel, exist in the cytoplasm in homo- or heterodimers that can bind with I\u03baB. During conditions of stimulation by LPS or other pro-inflammatory factors, I\u03baB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates I\u03baB, leading to NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and further activation of inflammatory genes22. It has been confirmed that toll-like receptor 4 -NF\u03baB signaling plays a key role in acute lung injury23. Our studies show that LPS activates NF-\u03baB and its signaling pathways, while rolipram restrains activation. This indicates that the NF-\u03baB may be part of the mechanism by which rolipram exerts its effects.",

As a conserved signaling cascade, the MAPK pathway exists in almost all eukaryotic cells. MAPKs can regulate target protein function through phosphorylation, thus participating in cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and function. MAPK signaling is activated through three levels, including MAP3K, MAPKK, and MAPK. At present, four MAPK signaling pathways have been identified: ERK1/2, ERK5, p38 MAPK, and JNK24. It has been found that rolipram promotes the maturation of glial progenitor cells and regeneration of myelin through enhancement of ERK phosphorylation25. Studies have also found that rolipram restrains bone cancer pain through inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway in the bone marrow, suppressing neuron-stellate cell activation26. In addition, rolipram can inhibit LPS-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in J774 cells13. However, the role of rolipram on phosphorylation of the MAPK downstream signaling pathways has not yet been reported. Our results indicated that rolipram suppresses LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in lung tissue, suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway \u2013 as well as NF-\u03baB \u2013 may mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of rolipram.",

Blood samples and organs were collected at 24 hr after LPS injection. Data represent mean and SD of at least three independent experiments, performed in triplicate. Comparisons between two groups were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s T-tests. *Represents p < 0.05 vs. control, #represents p < 0.05 vs. LPS alone.",

(A) Rolipram inhibits LPS-induced NF-\u03baB/p65 nuclear translocation in lung tissue. Mice received vehicle or rolipram (10 mg/kg i.p.) 1 hr after LPS (15 mg/kg i.p.) injected. Lungs were collected for immunofluorescence staining 3 hr after LPS injection. (B) Rolipram decreased LPS-induced NF-\u03baB/p65 phosphorylation in lung tissue. Mice received vehicle or rolipram (10 mg/kg i.p.) 1 hr after LPS (15 mg/kg i.p.) injection. Lung tissues were collected 3 hr after injection for Western blot. The phosphorylated NF-\u03baB/p65 chemiluminescent signal was quantified and normalized to total NF-\u03baB/p65. Phosphorylated NF-\u03baB/p65 is expressed in arbitrary units. LPS-stimulated cells were set as 100%, and other values are taken from said setting. (C\u2013E) Mice received vehicle or rolipram (10 mg/kg i.p.) 1 hr before LPS (15 mg/kg i.p.) injection. Lungs were collected at 3 hr after injection. The chemiluminescent signal was quantified; phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were normalized against total ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylated protein levels are expressed in arbitrary units. LPS-stimulated cells were set at 100%, and other values relate to that setting. Data represent the mean and SD of at least three independent experiments, performed in triplicate. Significant differences between more than two groups were performed using ANOVA. Comparisons between two groups were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s T-tests. *Represents p < 0.05 vs. control, #represents p < 0.05 vs. LPS alone.",
