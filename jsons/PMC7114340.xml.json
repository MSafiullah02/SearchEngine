This was followed at the beginning of 2003 by worldwide spreading of the infection. The SARS-causing agent was identified as a coronavirus (CoV), probably of animal origin. The SARS outbreak was brought under control after 6 months except for a few sporadic cases diagnosed in the following months (Peiris et al., 2004). However, since until today the source of the virus is unknown and the virus may still exist in animals, there remains the risk of a new outbreak.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with a single positive-stranded genome. The genome of the SARS CoV comprises 29,751 nucleotides and contains 15 partly overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The ORFs 1a and 1b encode the viral transcriptase. Four other ORFs are assigned to viral structural proteins, the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003). In infected cells, the nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant of the viral proteins (He et al., 2004). In the virion, nucleoprotein molecules associate with viral RNA forming the helical nucleocapsid (Davies et al., 1981, Nelson et al., 2000). The protein contains both nuclear localisation and export signals (Rowland et al., 2005, Timani et al., 2005, You et al., 2005) suggesting shuttling of the protein between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartment in virus-infected cells. Electron microscopy, conventional immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses demonstrate that the N protein is located in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, in cells transfected with expression plasmids that contain the nucleoprotein gene, the N protein was observed in the nucleus (Chang et al., 2004, Ksiazek et al., 2003, You et al., 2005). Moreover, nucleolar localisation of the SARS nucleoprotein in transfected cells was reported (Li et al., 2005). However, inconsistent data were obtained with respect to the presence of the N protein in the nucleus of virus-infected cells with some studies seeing no evidence of nuclear localisation (Qinfen et al., 2004, Rowland et al., 2005, Timani et al., 2005, You et al., 2005).",

With human sera, major antigenic sites have been assigned to the central and C-terminal part of the nucleocapsid protein (Wang et al., 2003). Further analysis indicated that the majority of human sera recognise conformational epitopes (Chen et al., 2004), but precise amino acid sequences of conformational epitopes have not yet been determined.",

It is highly basic enabling it to interact with acidic genomic RNA (Rota et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2003). The structure of an N-terminal portion of the nucleoprotein (amino acid residues 45\u2013181) of the virus comprising a putative RNA-binding domain has been analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The protein fragment consists of a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet. An additional \u03b2-hairpin connects \u03b22 and \u03b23. The \u03b23-strand contains the amino acid sequence FYYLGTGP that is conserved among all coronaviruses (Huang et al., 2004). The structure of the central and C-terminal portions of the protein has been less well-characterized. Computer modelling by Tang et al. (2005) identified a region around amino acids 250\u2013360 that exhibits a distinctively ordered structure. In addition, there is a lysine-rich region (amino acids 362\u2013390) of unknown function possibly involved in RNA-binding (He et al., 2004) or nuclear localisation (Wang et al., 2003).",

To generate carboxyterminally truncated N proteins, the N gene was cut by endonuclease digestion to produce fusion proteins containing the N protein amino acids (aa) 1\u201369 (N69), 1\u2013120 (N120), or 1\u2013213 (N213). The recombinant nucleocapsid protein (molecular weight: \u223c46 kDa) was expressed in E. coli as a complete \u223c90 kDa fusion protein (N-MBP) of N together with the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) and as carboxyterminally truncated N-MBP proteins after induction with 0.3 mM IPTG at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. As control, the pMALc2X vector was used for expression of the \u223c51 kDa MBP. The bacterial pellets were solubilised and sonicated in column buffer (2% 1 M Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2% 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% 1 M NaN3, 0.07% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). By exploiting the high affinity of MBP for maltose, the proteins were purified and concentrated with amylose resin solution (New England BioLabs, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using bovine \u03b3-globulin as standard. The purified N-MBP fusion protein was used for immunisation of mice and in immunological analyses.",

The large area stained and the strong fluorescence signal indicates synthesis of large amounts of this protein in the infected cell. The granular structure of the stained area indicates that the nucleoprotein is associated with virus particles or nucleocapsids packaged in cytoplasmic vesicles and is not diffusing freely in the cytoplasm. This corresponds well with the demonstration of SARS virus nucleocapsid particles in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in virus morphogenesis matrix vesicae (VMMV) as well as virus particles fully assembled in the smooth vesicles from the Golgi apparatus (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Qinfen et al., 2004). The nucleoprotein of other coronaviruses has been located in both cytoplasm and nucleus with a predilection for the nucleolus (Hiscox et al., 2001, Wurm et al., 2001). Moreover, the SARS CoV N protein contains putative nuclear localisation and export regions (Chang et al., 2004, Marra et al., 2003, Rowland et al., 2005, Timani et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2003, You et al., 2005) suggesting nuclear shuttling. Nuclear localisation of the SARS N protein has been observed with transfected cells (Chang et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005, You et al., 2005). However, in virus-infected cells, the findings by different research groups regarding the nuclear localisation of the N protein were consistent with the retention of the N protein in the cytoplasm (Rowland et al., 2005, Timani et al., 2005, You et al., 2005). Moreover, the study of Rowland and colleagues demonstrated that the lysine-rich domain covered by aa 369\u2013389 lacked nuclear transport activity (Rowland et al., 2005).",

In fact, these peptides contained two epitopes recognised by four of the mAbs in this study. However, an additional five epitope peptides recognised by the antibodies were only partially or not represented by the predicted peptides. Similarly, computer modelling by the method of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar predicted 16 antigenic peptides in the central and C-terminal part of the N protein (He et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2003). A comparison of the peptide sequences with the epitopes identified in this study showed that none of the epitopes associated with a B-cell immune response contained any of the 16 peptides predicted in the semi-empirical model. This indicates that the specificity of the B-cell response to SARS nucleoprotein in mice is poorly amenable to predictions based on hydrophobicity analysis.",

In contrast, the structure of the central and C-terminal part of the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein has not yet been clarified. Identification of conformational epitopes in the C-terminal area permits postulations on the protein configuration. For instance, to be accessible to the antibodies, the epitope sequences must not be covered by other parts of the molecule. Furthermore, comparison with predictions of the tertiary structure (Wang et al., 2003) indicates that the converging amino acids 286\u2013295, 316\u2013325, 360\u2013370 recognised by antibody 6D11C1 are located in or close to different helical sequences. Moreover, a major conformational epitope in this area provides experimental evidence for the highly ordered structure of the region around aa 250\u2013360 that has been previously predicted (Tang et al., 2005). Biochemical studies demonstrate that aa 270\u2013370 comprise a dimerisation domain of the nucleoprotein (Yu et al., 2005) which is analogous to a dimerisation domain in the nucleoprotein of other coronaviruses (Fan et al., 2005). Recent crystal structure analysis of this region in both the SARS coronavirus (Yu et al., 2006) and of the structural homolog in infectious bronchitis virus (Jayaram et al., 2006) demonstrate that epitope residues aa 316\u2013325 and 360\u2013370 recognised by antibody 6D11C1 are in close proximity in the monomeric form of the N protein. In contrast, aa 286\u2013295, which represent part of the antibody epitope, are distantly located. Dimerisation of the protein results in juxtaposition of aa 286\u2013295 of one nucleoprotein molecule to aa 316\u2013325 and 360\u2013370 of the second peptide molecule. Thus, the epitope identified independently supports the structural analysis results reported by Jayaram et al. (2006) and Yu et al. (2006) and suggests that the monoclonal antibody 6D11C1 cross-links two nucleocapsid protein molecules. It would be interesting to examine whether cross-linkage of SARS nucleoprotein dimers by the monoclonal antibody affects infectivity of the virus.",
