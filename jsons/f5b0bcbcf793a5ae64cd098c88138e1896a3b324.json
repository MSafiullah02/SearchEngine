Nevertheless, the particular underlying mechanisms of these exuberant 52 inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown and there is a need 53 to expand our knowledge of the host's response. In this context, several recent omics-based 54 approaches, including in vivo and in vitro transcriptional profiling studies, have highlighted 55 specific aspects of the signature of infection that could contribute to COVID-19 (Blanco-Melo 56 et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020; Messina et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020). Blanco-Melo and 57 colleagues, using transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, have notably 58 shown that the SARS-CoV-2 infection signature was defined by low levels of Type I and III 59 interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6 (Blanco-Melo et 60 al., 2020).",

            "text": "It is now well known that superinfections of bacterial/fungal origin can affect the course and 63 severity of respiratory viral infections. For example, the co-pathogenesis of viruses and 64 bacteria into the lung has been extensively studied, notably in the context of influenza 65 superinfection by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae (Bosch et al., 2013; McCullers, 2014; 66 Morens et al., 2008; Paget and Trottein, 2019). To date, there are limited data available on 67 superinfections associated with COVID-19, though superinfections were reported in 10%-20% 68 of SARS-CoV-2-infected adults admitted to Wuhan hospitals through the end of January 2020, 69 and notably in 50%-100% of those who died (Zhou et al., 2020). In intensive care units, COVID-70 19 patients are at high risk of developing secondary infections, including fungal infections e.g. 71 4 invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Lescure et al., 2020). Indeed, a recent study on the French 72 COVID-19 cohort reported that 33% of critically ill COVID-19 patients also showed invasive 73 aspergillosis (Alanio et al., 2020). However, while the reasons for increased vulnerability to 74 Aspergillus in COVID-19 patients remain undetermined, the putative contribution of Aspergillus 75 to SARS-CoV-2 related lung inflammation and COVID-19 pathophysiology also constitutes a 76 major unanswered question. 77 78 To better understand the biological impact of superinfection in the SARS-CoV-2 context we 79 sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus 80 that of a SARS-CoV-2 + Aspergillus superinfection. To reach this goal, we established a model 81 of SARS-CoV-2 infection and superinfection in reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE), 82 based on previously published works (Nicolas de Lamballerie et al., 2019; Pizzorno et al., 2019, 83 2020). Our analysis reveals that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong 84 deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, however, it 85 also highlights unique transcriptional footprints of the SARS-CoV-2 + Aspergillus 86 superinfection that provide valuable insight for the understanding not only of Aspergillus-87 associated COVID-19 but also for the management of severe forms of aspergillosis. 88 89 90 RESULTS 91 92 In order to identify similarities and differences between the host response to SARS-CoV-2 93 simple infection and Aspergillus superinfection, we sought to investigate the transcriptome of 94 human respiratory epithelial cells during infection, in comparison with non-infected cells. Aware 95 of the inherent limitations of experimental models using cell lines, we set up a model of 96 infection/superinfection in a physiological model of reconstituted human airway epithelium 97 (HAE). Developed from biopsies of nasal or bronchial cells differentiated in the air/liquid 98 interphase, these HAE models, that we previously used with different respiratory viruses 99 including SARS-CoV-2 (Nicolas de Lamballerie et al., 2019; Pizzorno et al., 2019, 2020) 100 reproduce with high fidelity most of the main structural, functional and innate immune features 101 of the human respiratory epithelium that play a central role during infection, hence constituting 102 an interesting surrogate to study airway disease mechanisms. We infected nasal or bronchial 103 HAE with SARS-CoV-2, and superinfection with Aspergillus was performed at 48 hours post-104 infection (hpi), which we had previously defined as the peak of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in 105 the HAE model (Pizzorno et al., 2020). Mock-infected, infected (CoV) and superinfected 106 samples (CoV+Asp) were harvested at 72 hpi (24 h after superinfection) to perform mRNA-",

In the 117 context of CoV+Asp superinfection, the number of DEGs was notably higher, with 2979 and 118 3235 genes in nasal and bronchial HAE, respectively (Extended data. File 1). Interestingly, 119 there was an important overlap between CoV infection and CoV+Asp superinfection 120 associated DEGs in both nasal and bronchial models. As illustrated in the Venn diagrams (Fig. 121 1C), more than 96% (nasal HAE) and 99% (bronchial HAE) of DEGs of the CoV signature 122 were also part of the CoV+Asp signature.

Interestingly, functional 131 enrichments specific to CoV infection or CoV+Asp superinfection were also highlighted. For 132 example, CoV infection but no superinfection induced the upregulation of a gene cluster 133 involved in Type I interferon pathway (Fig. 1D) . Conversely, gene clusters harboring terms 134 associated with epithelium physiology and cilium movements (regulation of cellular component 135 movements, cell projection assembly, intraflagellar transport) but also with intra and extra-136 cellular signaling (post-translational protein phosphorylation, protein localization to 137 extracellular membrane, peptide secretion) were exclusively enriched in the context of 138 CoV+Asp superinfection (Fig. 1D) .

Interestingly, IFN-\u03bb has 252 been identified as a critical regulator of neutrophil activation to prevent fungal infection such 253 as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis(Espinosa et al., 2017). Our data suggest a divergence 254 between type I and type III interferon responses, with enhanced activation of the latter in the 255 context of fungal superinfection. This characteristic response could be associated with increased neutrophil activation as an important first line of adaptive defense against these two the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in line with currently available clinical data from COVID-261 19 patients, which generally present high levels of circulating neutrophils(Chen et al., 2020;    262Qin et al., 2020). These observations support an important role of neutrophil recruitment in the 263 response to COVID-19, more particularly in the context of fungal superinfection with an 264 exacerbation of pro-inflammatory response. In that sense, the upregulation of key genes 265 belonging to the IL-10 pathway observed in our analysis(Fig. 2C), previously demonstrated to 266 play a deleterious role in innate resistance to systemic aspergillosis(Clemons et al., 2000),267constitutes an illustration of how such \"enhanced\" state of inflammation could contribute to 268 increase severity.269 270In conclusion, our transcriptional profiling approach revealed unique features of the SARS-271CoV-2 + Aspergillus superinfection signature, characterized on one side by an \"enhanced\"272 version of that induced by SARS-CoV infection, but also by specific changes on respiratory 273 tissue physiology, a distinct regulation of type I and type III interferons, and an over-induction 274 of inflammatory response. While we acknowledge that it would be rather bold to make a 275 statement on the possible severity associated with Aspergillus superinfection in a pre-existing 276 COVID-19 pathological context based solely on our results, our observations suggest that the 277 immunomodulation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection could establish a favorable context for 278 the development of severe forms of aspergillosis .This could constitute an important aspect to 279 be considered for the immunological follow-up of COVID-19 patients with aspergillosis.

The 302 BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain used in this study was isolated directly 303 from a patient sample as described elsewhere (Pizzorno et al., 2020). Viral stocks were 304 prepared and quantified in Vero E6 cells (TCID50/mL). Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16404) was 305 quantified on maltose extract agar plates (CFU/ml). was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, ref 74104) with DNase 309 treatment, following the manufacturer's instruction. 500 \u03bcg total RNA was used to prepare 310 polyA-enriched RNA-seq libraries using the KAPA mRNA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche, ref. 311 KK8581/KK8581). Those libraries were prepared separately for each sample with 11 312 amplification cycles, then all libraries were equimolar-pooled before sequencing. Paired-end 313 sequencing (2\u00d7100bp) was performed with Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform on a 314 SP flowcell (Illumina, ref: 20040326).",
