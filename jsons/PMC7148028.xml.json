Despite the increasing use of the Web to search for health-related information, there may exist inequalities in access to health information [6]. Users with low levels of health literacy can struggle to satisfy their information needs because health-related information usually contains medico-scientific expressions that are not easily understandable [13]. The gap between lay and medico-scientific terminologies limits this access and can be assisted through query modification techniques [10]. There is evidence that multilingual query suggestions in lay and medico-scientific terminologies improve health information retrieval by laypeople [9].",

In English, the use of WSD helps to reduce the processing time because fewer atoms are retrieved and, therefore, less processing is needed afterward. The CHV/UMLS-preferred are the fastest methods since they only need to identify the concept and retrieve the corresponding CHV/UMLS-preferred expression.\n",

The best method to suggest lay queries is the one that uses the CHV-preferred expressions (the most familiar ones) to substitute the identified concepts. The best method to suggest medico-scientific suggestions uses UMLS-preferred expressions. These methods are better in the relevance and understandability but are also better in generation time.
