In both hypothetical scenarios, a correct diagnosis was assumed to be made within an hour upon admission. In one scenario, the impact of reduced time\u2010to\u2010diagnosis on in\u2010hospital resource utilization and associated costs was modeled (scenario 1), whereas the second model took into account reduced hospital stay as well (scenario 2). Patients presenting at the out\u2010patient clinic were distinguished from those presenting at the emergency department. A Markov model was constructed to reflect the in\u2010hospital routing of patients, distinguishing seven specific states (Figure 1). In each scenario, patients started at the outpatient clinic or the emergency department (state 1). They could either remain in that state, be discharged (ie, not hospitalized, state 7), or they could be hospitalized, in isolated care (state 2) or not (state 3). In both cases, their infection status was unknown. From state 2 they could either remain in that state, or progress to the state \u201cisolated care, infectious state established/need for isolated care confirmed\u201d (state 4), progress to the state \u201cnot isolated care, infectious state established/need for isolated care disconfirmed\u201d (ie no influenza or RSV detected, state 5), or progress to state 6 (\u201cnot isolated care, infectious state is known, absence of isolation confirmed\u201d).
