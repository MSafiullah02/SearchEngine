Bioaerosols, such as pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungal spores, are associated with infectious diseases, allergies, and asthma [2,[5], [6], [7]]. For example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, which have recently killed hundreds of people in East Asia, are transmitted by direct inhalation of contaminated bioaerosols [8]. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the bioaerosol concentration within indoor air be less than 500 CFU/m3\nair [9,10].",

A major reason for the slow pace of development is the difficulty of determining the concentration and type of bioaerosols in the air stream [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Bioaerosols are typically detected by first collecting them in a liquid or on a surface and analyzing the collected particles using culture-based techniques, biochemical assays (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14,[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Recently, the development of real-time detection systems for microorganisms in liquid medium has made considerable progress [14,[21], [22], [23]]; however, the performance of bioaerosol sampling systems with regard to biological stability, particle collection efficiency, and particle enrichment is still insufficient for use as a real-time system. In addition, integration of the bioaerosol sampling system and the detection system, including rapid and stable sample transfer, would be desirable for continuous real-time monitoring of bioaerosols.",

Tan et al. developed an automated electrostatic sampler that involves collection of bioaerosols in a liquid reservoir and their delivery to sensing devices [24]. Liu et al. and other researchers described an airborne pathogen direct analysis system based on microfluidic enrichment [[11], [12], [13]]; however, these systems require prolonged sampling for enrichment. A novel bioaerosol sampling system, the MicroSampler, based on two-phase fluid control in a microchip can be used with a real-time bioaerosol sensor [25]; however, due to the low throughput, adequate sampling is difficult in the presence of bioaerosol concentrations < 500 CFU/m3\nair.",

Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341) were used as the test airborne microorganisms. These Gram-positive bacteria are commonly found in indoor environments and on human skin [31,32], and are used widely in bioaerosol research [21,[33], [34], [35]]. In particular, S. epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen and is the most common source of infections on indwelling medical devices [36]. The bacteria were incubated in nutrient broth (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Upon reaching an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, bacterial suspensions were harvested by centrifugation (5000 \u00d7 g, 10 min), washed three times with sterilized deionized water (SDW) and diluted with 20 mL of SDW. Subsequently, a 30 mL aliquot (\u223c 108 colony forming units (CFU)/mL) was poured into the nebulizer.",

The drag force of the fluid on the particle is proportional to the cube of the particle size, whereas the force between the particle and the wall is proportional to the particle size. Therefore, if fine aerosols directly adhere to the cyclone wall, there is no way to remove the particles, resulting in sampling loss [41]. The influence of air flow on a liquid film can be expressed by the modified Webber number, Wem. This can be conceived of as a measure of the relative importance of the inertia of a fluid compared to its surface tension [25]:(2)Wem=\u03c1l\u2219Ua2\u2219tl\u03c3lwhere \u03c1l is the liquid density, tl is the thickness of the liquid film and \u03c3l is the surface tension of the liquid.",

For the reasons mentioned above, the air flow rate was set at > 12 L/min and the liquid drainage flow rate was limited to 12 mL/h to attain an enrichment ratio of > 104. Within the cyclone the surface of the thin liquid film rapidly evaporates due to the high air flow rate; therefore, if the liquid supply flow rate was lower than or equal to the drainage flow rate, a stable liquid film would not be formed and the liquid would split into multiple streams (Fig. 2\n(a)(i); supplied liquid flow rate (Qs) = 9 mL/h, drainage liquid flow rate (Qd) = 10 mL/h).

The total collection efficiency of both bioaerosols was > 99% (Fig. 5(c2)). Next, the microbial recovery of bioaerosols sampled by the ARBSW system was assessed. A comparative test was conducted with the conventional verified bioaerosol sampler, called BioSampler, which has a collection efficiency of > 90% for bioaerosol sizes of > 0.5 \u03bcm and a microbial recovery of > 99%. According to the BioSampler\u2019s operational manual, 12.5 L/min of air enters 20 mL of sampling liquid in a reservoir and the enrichment of the collected particles is proportional to the sampling time (typically 20 min to reduce the desiccation effect) [25,[37], [38], [39]]. In contrast, the ARBSW system maintains a high particle enrichment ratio regardless of the sampling time, due to the constant air-to-liquid flow rate ratio (\u223c 1.4 \u00d7 105; use of the continuous entered air flow (16 L/min) and drainage liquid flow (7 mL/h)). Therefore, if there is no biological or physical loss in the ARBSW system, the concentration of microbes captured by the ARBSW during 20 min is theoretically \u223c 11-fold higher than that of the BioSampler under the same environmental conditions. Fig. 5(d) shows photographs of colonies of S. epidermidis and M. luteus after collection. The sampling time was 20 min and the TANC of test bacterial bioaerosols was kept constant at \u223c 100 particles/cm3\nair. The colony concentrations of S. epidermidis (460 \u00b1 24.1 CFU/mL) and M. luteus (338 \u00b1 19.5 CFU/mL) sampled by the ARBSW system were \u223c 11.2- and \u223c 10.6-fold higher than those by the BioSampler, which were 41 \u00b1 6.0 and 32 \u00b1 3.5 CFU/mL, respectively. These values correspond to the theoretical predictions. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the relative microbial recovery of S. epidermidis and M. luteus using the ARBSW system was 102 \u00b1 4.2% and 96 \u00b1 5.4%, respectively (those of the BioSampler were fixed at 100%), showing that the ARBSW system has comparable microbial recovery to the BioSampler.",

Fig. 6(b) shows the TANC and colony concentration of the bioaerosols at 1-min intervals during the test. APS showed that the TANC rapidly increased from 0 to 1.6 particles/cm3\nair during the first nebulization, and decreased to 0.4 particles/cm3\nair after 1-min of nebulization. After 2 min of nebulization, the TANC was < 0.1 particles/cm3\nair, indicating removal of > 90% of bioaerosols. The colony concentration increased to 0.24 CFU/cm3\nair during the nebulization and decreased to 0.06 CFU/cm3\nair within 1 min. After 2 min of nebulization, the concentration was < 0.01 CFU/cm3\nair. In the second nebulization, the TANC increased from 0 to 1.2 particles/cm3\nair and the colony concentration increased from 0 to 0.2 CFU/cm3\nair.

This system has superior particle collection and particle transfer efficiency into a liquid medium. Compared with a conventional bioaerosol sampler, the ARBSW system enables marked particle enrichment and stable microbial recovery. Furthermore, the ARBSW not only has an excellent sampling performance with rapid responsivity, but is also suitable for the real-time monitoring of bioaerosols in real-world environments. The continuous liquid-based particle sampling used by the ARBSW system, when integrated with a real-time particle analysis system (e.g., microfluidic flow cytometer), enables continuous quantitative characterization of airborne microorganisms and facilitates analysis of the physicochemical and biological properties of bioaerosols, for example using markers for specific aptamers or antibodies.",
