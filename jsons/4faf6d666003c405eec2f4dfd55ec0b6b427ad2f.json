Driven principally by buman and mouse studies, comparative MHC projects among other mammalian species offer certain advantages in connecting MHC genome characters to natural situations. We have studied the MHC in the domestic cat and in several wild species of Felidae. Our observations affirm dass I and class II homology vi/ith other mammalian orders, derivative gene duplications during the Felidae radiation, abundant persistent transspecies allele polymorphism, recombination-derived amino acid motifs, and inverted ratios of non-synonymous to silent substitutions in the MHC peptide-binding regions, consistent with overdominant selection in dass I and II genes. MHC diversity as quantified in population studies is a powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction for several endangered species including cheetahs, Asiatic lions, Florida panthers and tigers. In two cases (Florida panther and cbeetah), reduced MHC variation may be contributing to uniform population sensitivity to emerging infectious pathogens. The Felidae species, nearly all endangered and monitored for conservation concerns, have allowed a glimpse of species adaptation, mediated by MHC divergence, using comparative inferences drawn from human and mouse models.",

A half century of research into the biology and functioning of the group of genetically clustered loci called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has resolved a rich and intricate genomic system upon which immune defenses depend, exposing patterns and processes of immune coadaptation by mammalian hosts to invading parasites.

The mammalian MHC encodes two categories of cell stn^face giycoproteins (class I and II) which transport and present peptides from invading parasites or microbes to the T-cell receptors of immune cells (6) (7) (8) . Class I products, non-covalently associated with p2-microglobuhn, are expressed on the surface of all somatic cells. They capture 8-10 amino acid-long peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to presenting these on cell surfaces to CD8-positive. CD4negative cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Class II molecules are het\u1ebd rodimers of a and p chains (i.e. products of DRA and DRB genes), expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as B celk, dendritic cells, and macrophages. They load 12-24 amino acid-long peptides from endosomes and present these to CD4-positive, CD8-negative T-helper cells, which respond by releasing cytokines and stimtilating both humoral antibody production by B cells and cytotoxic T-cell proliferation.",

Further, nucleotide sequences of single MHC alleles differ at multiple nucleotide positions (up to 100 substitutions between HLA-B alleles), rendering the MHC the most extremely polymorphic gene cluster described. A relatively slow spontaneous mutation rate plus the identification of patchwork display of amino acid motifs among MHC class I and II alleles lends support to the interpretation that gene conversion is an equivalent or greater source of novel alleles than is mutation for some MHC loci (10) (11) (12) (13) . The identification of near identical peptide motifs among related species (e.g. human, gorilla or chimpanzee) alleles has been interpreted as evidence that much of the variation present today originated in common ancestors of the great apes or earlier (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) .",

Zinkernagel and Doherty suggested 25 years ago that MHC diversity may function as an intrinsic monitor of self-recognition (MHC restriction) in presenting parasitic peptides lo T cells (7, 22, 23) . Thus, individuals who could maximize their peptide recognition potential, itself limited by MHC allele recognition repertoire, would be more likely to survive outbreaks of lethal pathogens than those with fewer specificities. Strong support for that inference was the demonstration that nucleotide substitutions between MHC class 1 and between class II alleles were predominantly nonsynonymous (codon altering) for residues in the peptide-binding region (PBR) (also called the antigen recognition site), while synonymous substitutions were far more common among the other regions of the molecule not involved in peptide recognition (24) (25) (26) (27) . These observations were interpreted as evidence for positive selective pressures favoring increased diversity (and antigen recognition) within the PBR. but purifying selection limiting amino acid-changing substitutions for the rest of the MHC molecule.",

Proposed alternative selective pressures (e.g. maternal-fetal incompatibility, assortive mate choice mediated by olfaction genes, some of which are included within the MHC) (35) (36) (37) (38) are difficult to reconcile with the selective drive to increased codon alteration in the PBR, and not in the other portion of class I and class II genes (24) . Finally, a role for MHC allele-specific inflnence in pathogen sensitivity has been observed in a few cases (avian Marek's disease, human malaria, and bovine immunodeficiency virus) (39-4-2), and MHC homozygosity has been implicated Ln accelerating two human infectious diseases (hepatitis B and AIDS) (43, 43a) . As many articles in this volume detail, the vertebrate MHC has enormous diversity, handed down from ancestral species adaptations that protected their progenitors from the ravages of historic epidemics, the footprints of which we encounter today in genomes of living species. To extend these inferences to a group with considerable biological background and information, we began to study the MHC organization and allelic diversity in domestic cats (Felis CQtus) and their wild relatives. The domestic cat offers some special advantages for such an approach (44, 45) . First, there are over 60 million cats in the U S. (compared to 50 million dogs) and the veterinary community offers a vast resource for ascertainment of hereditary, immunological, and infectious diseases. Deadly viral pathogens have been described, including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a coronavirus (46); feline leukemia/sarcoma virus (PeLV/FeSV), an oncogenic retrovirus (47); feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a lentivirus causing feline AIDS (48) ; and others for which diagnostic, immunologic, and therapeutic reagents are developed (3). Feral domestic cats are distributed throughout the world and have adapted to human environments as well as any carnivore except domestic dogs. Finally, a moderate resolution genetic map of the cat has been developed (including comparative anchor loci and hypervariable microsateliite markers) which by comparative mapping displays striking homology to the more \"gene-dense\" human and mouse gene maps (45, 49) .",

Studies on Felidae evolution, systematics and conservation have led to the assembly of skeletons, pelts, and blood and tissue cell lines from individuals of each species allowing an in-depth look at genomic divergence within a relatively recent evolutionary period (51) (52) (53) . Because many wild cats are both charismatic and highly endangered, populations are monitored closely for ecological studies (54-56) and more recently for chnical health including infectious disease (50, (57) (58) (59) .

Briefly, the modern Felidae can be considered as eight groups of phylogenetically related species. Monophyletic clustering of these species using mitochondrial DNA sequences, allozymes, albumin immunoiogical distance, Y chromosome sequences, and other methods affirm these groupings (52, 53, 60) . The first and oldest group includes eight South American cat species related to the ocelots and margays, species which migrated into South America when the Panama isthmus joined North and South Americas 2-5 MYBP The second group, including Mediterranean small cat species closely related to the African/European wildcat, the domestic cat's closest ancestor, diverged 8-10 milhon years ago. The remaining groups of middle and large-sized cats began divergence 5-8 MYBP and led to the great cats, genus Panthera, which began its speciation events 2-5 MYBP. For scale consider that all 3 7 cat species emerged in a 12-15 million year period, the same time frame that separated the three African great ape species (gorilla, chimps, and man) from the single Asian great ape species, orang utan.

The mouse DP region includes mainly pseudogenes and the DR (I-E) region is non-functional in mouse strains due to a deletion of the promoter region, a premature termination codon, and a defect in RNA processing of Ea. Mole rats, also rodents, are reported to use DP class II genes exclusively (75).",

Phylogenetic analysis ofthe 61 DRB variable regions revealed five monophyletic clusters or clades (Fig. 3) . The five cluster lineage is itself monophyletic witb respect to the canid DRB genes, indicating that cat MHC evolution has proceeded in a cumulative divergence since the separation of arctoid (dog-like) andfeloid (cat-like) carnivores. In five cats, three alleles of a single phylogenetic lineage were observed, suggesting rather recent duphcation of the DRB loci after the evolutionary establishment of monophyly.. In general, clade monophyly and locus duplication might be expected to correlate, unless duplication is so recent (as noted here) that locus-specific divergence has not accumulated sufficient divergence to be apparent.",

Consistent with the observation in the human and monse comparisons, an analysis of the relative rate of synonymous vs nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution within the PBR versus tbe residual residues of domestic cat cDNA transcripts show nearly double the incidence of non-synonymous (codon-altering) variants among the PBR residues (Fig. SA) . By contrast, synonymous (or silent) substitutions are more common in the non-PBR regions. The same discrepancy (i.e. an excess of non-synonymons substitution in the PBR) is observed when feline class II DRB alleles are compared. The domestic cat then pro-vides the third mammalian species where the pattern is affirmed: dn>>d, in PBR. but ds>>dnin the remainder ofthe region. In Fig. 5 , a consistent excess of non-synonym ons substitutions within, but not outside, the PBR was apparent for comparisons within two other species (ocelot and margay) as well as between feline species MHC genes (class I and II). The simplest interpretation for the pattern would be that natural selection has acted to preserve PBR amino acid sequence variation in both MHC class I and class II genes, likely in response to ancient epidemics. Sites outside the PBR which confer structure, assembly, and recognition of common antigen features are constrained from amino acid changes by purifying selection, as is observed in most other genes, while synonymous mutations occur at a steady rate similar to selectively neutral regions. This overdominance hypothesis, which favors heterozygote advantage, has been presented and supported cogendy based on similar data in human and mouse (10, (24) (25) (26) (27) .",

A comparison of class I sequence diversity among three species (70) from separate evolutionary lineages of Fehdae (Fig. 1) revealed that the extent of allele sequence diversity within outbred species was comparable to the extent of diversity among the species. Thus, nucleotide sequence similarity between class I gene transcripts was 93% for cheetah, 93-99% for ocelot, 92-100% for domestic cat, and 90-95% when compared between species. Further, only 13% of all Felidae nucleotide variation observed was species specific. The equivalence of the quantity of variation within and among cat species, plus the paucity of species-specific variation, suggests that the majority of variation preceded species origins and has been transmitted en bloc to modern species from their ancestors.",

Yuhki, E. Eizirit, W Johnson. S. J. O'Brien, manuscript submitted). When DRB sequences from five nondomestic Felidae species (Geoffroy's cat, Iriomote cat, tigrina, ocelot, margay) were analyzed phylogenetically, their sequences were never identical to domestic cat sequences but in most cases they clustered closely within one of the five monophyletic clades described by domestic cat DRB (Figs 3 & 6 ). This suggests that moderate mutation or recombinatiou-mediated divergence has occurred since speciation, but in the framework of much older clade reorganizations, dating to the Miocene or Ohgocene. An extensive phylogenetic analysis of DRB genes from sympatric ocelot and margay species sampled across their range in South and Central America revealed that both species retain the domestic cat DRB2, 3, and S clade variants, but lack the DRBl and DRB4. Ocelots revealed 111 alleles (in 35 individuals. Table 1) and showed a clade (DRB7) while margay (69 alleles from 26 individuals) showed a new species-specific clade, DRB6 (N. Yuhki, E. Eizirik, W Johnson, S. J. O'Brien, manuscript submitted) . If we consider the time elapsed since these two species shared a common ancestor (about 4-6 MYBP), then a DRB clade has emerged every 4^6 million years, about the time estimated for two new carnivore species to emerge (77) . If dade formation coincides roughly with gene duplication, such calculations are valuable in monitoring the selective forces which influence genome and MHC evolutionary processes.",

MHC monototony in cheetahs was affirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies of class I probes (84) plus by a reduction in DRB allele diversity detected, 20-fold less than in outbred species such as domestic cats or ocelots ( Table 1 ). The cheetah's MHC allehc homogenization was correlated with reduction in genome-wide allele variation in multiple non-MHC loci as well (81) (82) (83) . The interpretation of such genomic uniformity indicates that population-wide MHC variation in the ancestors of modern cheetahs was lost through an historic population bottleneck or series of bottlenecks which caused shedding of endemic species diversity during a near extinction event. Modern cheetahs carry the risk today of species-wide hypersensitivity to emerging infectious disease. The risk was reahzed in multiple fatal outbreaks of FIPV (a virus with low morbidity in domestic cats) which decimated several captive cheetah colonies (83, 85) . That free-ranging cheetahs survive at all today is probably due to their solitary territoriality, limiting the spread of lethal pathogens (55). Nevertheless, the cheetah's natural history revealed hy relative monomorphism at the MHC is a chilling example of the perils of abrupt loss of population variation following a population botdeneck.",

This means that in the near future MHC and other loci in cat species can be tested explicitly for association with disease resistance. Given the panoply of disease outbreaks known in cats (e.g. FIPV in cheetahs, FIV in several species, FeLV in domestic cats, canine distemper virus in hons and otbers), the genetic approaches are now approachable, due to new advances and tools in each of tbe areas. For the first time, we have the opportunity to test complex ecological hypotheses about population survival, an important step toward identifying the genetic adaptations that lead to species formation.

DNA, DOB) plus the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and low molecular mass poiypeptide (LMP) genes within 4,000 kb of chromosome 6p2l.3 (Fig. 2). Additional non-histocompatibility loci are foimd in both class I (ptubulin, S, HSR, MOG, olfactory receptor gene homologs) and class 11 (DMA, DMB, RING3) regions. The class III regions, located between class I and II, include genes ofthe complement system and other genes as well. There appear to he at least two functional class I cat loci based on the presence of three or four distinct cDNA transcripts found in single individuals(69,70).",
