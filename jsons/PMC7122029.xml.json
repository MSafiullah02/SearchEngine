Infection ensues when conidia (spores) are inhaled into the respiratory tract of a susceptible host. Nosocomial Aspergillus infections are often traced to hospital construction. Depending almost entirely on the immune response of the host, a wide spectrum of infections can occur. Although less common than candidiasis, Aspergillus infections are life threatening in immunosuppressed patients. Several forms of aspergillosis, specifically chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and sino-orbital aspergillosis, appear to occur more often in older adults (8, 9).",

Growth in culture of opportunistic fungi is rarely difficult; cultures are usually positive within a few days. The major complicating issue is that organisms as ubiquitous in the environment as Aspergillus or Rhizopus can easily contaminate specimens. Therefore, growth in culture must be carefully assessed as to whether it truly reflects infection (13). Confounding the diagnosis of candidiasis is the fact that Candida are normal flora in the GI and genitourinary (GU) tracts and on skin, and thus, growth from samples taken from non-sterile body sites often means only colonization. However, growth of Candida from blood or normally sterile body fluids is obviously significant. In contrast to the other opportunists, C. neoformans is neither common in the environment nor part of the normal flora, and thus growth of this organism in culture always reflects infection.",
