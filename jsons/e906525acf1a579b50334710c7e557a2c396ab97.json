Fear is often adaptive, protecting the animal from harm. However, at times fear can become maladaptive; it may be overwhelming (panic attack), irrational (phobia) or out of context. Fear-related behaviours mostly originate in the amygdala and are modulated via the autonomic nerve system. The autonomic and somatic signs (Table 2 .2) vary depending on the stimulus and its intensity; however, they can be grouped into defensive non-action (e.g. freezing, passiveness and hyper-attentiveness) or defensive action (e.g. flight or fight). The fear response is modulated primarily by noradrenalin both in the CNS and peripherally. In addition, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a role in fear-related behaviours in the amygdala. Ageing can lead to changes in fear responses in animals as a result of a decreased ability to cope with different triggers. For example, a dog with reduced hearing or vision and degenerative joint disease is not capable of avoiding a fearful situation as in the past and as a result may attack or freeze.

In dogs and cats, primary intracranial tumours are more common, while metastatic neoplasias (hemangiosarcoma, carcinomas or multicentric lymphoma) remain on the differential diagnosis list. Brain tumours are often classified according to the cell lineage they originate from (meninges, glial cells, choroid plexus cells, lymphocytes, ependymal cells, etc.) or based on the circumferential location of the tumour in relation to the brain (extra-axial, intraaxial or intraventricular). In both dogs and cats, the most common intracranial tumours are meningiomas and typically present as single extra-axial masses, while the most common intra-axial tumours are gliomas (astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, glioblastoma). Round cell tumours such as lymphoma or histiocytic sarcoma can present with an intra-axial, intraventricular or extra-axial localisation (Dickinson 2014) . The mechanisms of injury to the brain are multiple and depend on the size, growth and location of the tumour: direct invasion of the brain tissue and loss of function, ischaemia, focal compression, oedema formation and increased intracranial pressure, alteration of the balance of neurotransmitters, but also biochemical and immunological derangements.

It is not uncommon to diagnose a sizeable mass in the light of relatively subtle signs, as the brain is able to compensate for substantial changes in pressure and volume before the compensation mechanisms are exhausted. Behavioural changes are common and do not infrequently precede the development of neurological deficits that will make a forebrain neurolocalisation more obvious. As an example, the most common clinical signs in a study of pituitary macroadenoma were mentation (depression, stupor) and behavioural changes (pacing, disorientation, circling, head pressing, aggression). Behavioural changes can also be the only clinical complaint. Masses affecting the limbic system, association areas (such as the frontal lobe and parieto-temporal junction) or the ascending reticular activating system are likely to produce behavioural changes with or without any obvious neurological deficits (Berns et al. 2015) . The changes that can be seen include the development of fearful or aggressive behaviour or conversely the development of an attention-seeking behaviour in a previously fearful animal. Cats can be seen hiding more in unusual places or can be found stuck in a corner of a room. Head pressing or compulsively circling to one side only will raise the suspicion towards a significant intracranial lesion, with the former signs being suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. House soiling can also precede the development of more worrisome neurological signs and could be exacerbated by the presence of a concurrent endocrinopathy causing PU/PD (hyperadrenocorticism, central diabetes insipidus or acromegaly due to a secreting pituitary tumour). Raised intracranial pressure can also lead to clinical signs of pain including vocalisation, aggression, lethargy and head pressing behaviours (Madison et al. 2015) . A history of seizure is a specific sign for a forebrain lesion and can be seen in the absence of neurological deficits despite the presence of a substantial lesion. Neurological deficits will vary depending on the location and size of the mass and can suggest a focal or multifocal pathology.

The results of the MRI scan need to be interpreted in conjunction with the index of suspicion and additional tests. If the MRI scan is normal, then CSF is collected. Patients affected by CDS can have a normal brain MRI or evidence of brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement.

Consequently, MRI findings of brain atrophy are not diagnostic of CDS but are compatible with it (Ettinger and Feldman 2009 ). Differential diagnosis for brain atrophy on MRI includes CDS; degenerative storage diseases, in particular ceroid lipofuscinosis; congenital portosystemic shunt; chronic or repeated metabolic/toxic disturbances, for example, chronic hypoglycaemia; eosinophilic meningoencephalitis; Neospora infection; and chronic repetitive traumatic brain injury (Fig. 2.3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1109, "end": 1135, "text": "(Ettinger and Feldman 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1487, "end": 1497, "text": "(Fig. 2.3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Advanced Imaging"}, {"text": "MRI changes compatible with CDS:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Advanced Imaging"}, {"text": "\u2022 Normal MRI \u2022 Ventricular system dilation \u2022 Cortical atrophy-prominent sulci \u2022 Narrowing of the interthalamic adhesion", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Advanced Imaging"}, {"text": "The next step consists in performing a CSF analysis to rule out neoplastic or inflammatory conditions.
