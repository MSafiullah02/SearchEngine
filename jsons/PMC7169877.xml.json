This pathway is not only responsible for the destruction of the microbe\u2010containing vacuoles but also of pathogens that have gained access to the cytoplasm by either entering the cells or escaping the phagolysosomal pathway 4, 20. ATG proteins also participate in microbe clearance through a mechanism distinct from classical autophagy. LC3\u2010associated phagocytosis (LAP) is a process by which components of the ATG machinery directly modify the phagosomal membrane to assist and enhance degradation of phagocytosed elements 21, 22 (Figure 2). Sanjuan and co\u2010workers 23 were the first to demonstrate that TLR signaling mediates the rapid recruitment of LC3 to phagosomes. They observed that macrophages fed with either zymosan (a TLR2 agonist), Escherichia coli or latex beads coated with TLR agonists such as Pam3CSK4 (a TLR1/2 agonist) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS; a TLR4 agonist) recruit LC3 to the phagosomal membrane. The LC3 recruitment concurred with enhanced degradation of the phagocytosed cargo by a more rapid and extensive acidification of the phagosomal compartment 23. Localized TLR signaling at this site was necessary for LAP because no association of LC3 with phagosomes was observed in tlr2 knockout macrophages. Recruitment of LC3 to phagosomes requires ATG5 and ATG7 as well as the PtdIns3K complex 23, with BECLIN1 associating prior to LC3. In contrast to canonical autophagy, LAP does not depend on ULK1 and it is not affected by rapamycin, chloroquine or starvation 23, 24. The absence of double\u2010membrane structures surrounding the engulfed material morphologically also distinguishes LC3\u2010positive phagosomes from autophagosomes 23.",

This intracellular bacterium escapes phagosomes upon endocytosis using a type III secretion system and replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cells. An initial study investigating the interaction between B. pseudomallei and autophagy suggested a possible role of autophagosomes in reducing intracellular bacterial survival in phagocytic and non\u2010phagocytic cells 25. Later, however, ultrastructural evidences have revealed that B. pseudomallei is subjected to LAP rather than to conventional autophagy and that the previously observed colocalization of LC3 with bacteria must result from the recruitment of LC3 onto phagosomal membranes. In particular, electron microscopy (EM) analyses showed that although numerous autophagosomes were found in the cytoplasm of infected cells, they did not contain bacteria 26. In contrast B. pseudomallei was either surrounded by a single membrane or was found free in the cytoplasm.",

Surprisingly, heat\u2010killed B. pseudomallei display diminished recruitment of LC3 to phagosomes, indicating that live bacteria and signaling routes other than TLR activation might be involved in LAP induction 26. Nevertheless, LAP and efficient killing of B. pseudomallei also require BECLIN1 and are enhanced by starvation and rapamycin treatments 27. Surprisingly, BECLIN1 knockdown does not affect LAP in rapamycin\u2010treated cells raising new questions about the possible existence of either different LC3 pools or a BECLIN1\u2010independent LAP [in analogy to BECLIN1\u2010independent autophagy 28] as well as alternative mechanisms for the PtdIns3P synthesis on phagosomal membranes.

This type of modification of the endocytic compartments can also assist in the removal of apoptotic, necrotic or entotic cells. Dying cells have to be cleared from the extracellular milieu to avoid inflammatory and autoimmune reactions. Specific receptors on phagocytes recognize phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), which is normally absent on the surface of healthy cells but gets exposed after apoptosis or necrosis 30. Engagement of PtdSer and TIM4 is responsible for the engulfment of apoptotic or necrotic bodies and by a yet unidentified pathway, triggers the LAP of the dead cell bodies 24. Entosis is a novel form of non\u2010apoptotic cell death where an epithelial cell engulfs a living cell, which is then degraded in the lysosome 31. Similar to apoptotic and necrotic cell disposal, the limiting membranes of endosomes containing entotic cells rapidly recruit LC3 32. Both entosis and clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells depend on ATG5 and ATG7 as well as on the presence of the components of the PtdIns3K complex, such as VPS34 and BECLIN1, on the limiting membrane of the compartment 24, 32. In contrast to classical autophagy, components of the ULK complex, including ULK1 or FIP200, are not required for LAP progression.

A feature of several autoimmune diseases is the phagocytosis of host DNA associated with antibodies by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This leads to the activation of TLR9 that in turn induces the pathogenic secretion of type I interferons. TLR9 is an ER\u2010resident transmembrane protein, which has to relocate to the endolysosomal system in order to be proteolytically processed into the active form. The new data reveal that the DNA\u2010antibody complexes induce LAP, which results in the colocalization of LC3 and TLR9 in phagosomes 34. These events require ATG5, ATG7 and PtdIns3K activity but not the component of the ULK complex such as ULK1, ATG13 and FIP200 34. Collectively, these observations show that LAP plays a key role in the establishment of the so\u2010called TRL9\u2010positive interferon signaling compartments. The relevance of LAP in this process is elicited by the fact that this pathway is required for IFN\u2010\u03b1 secretion in response to DNA\u2010antibody complexes.",

This phenomenon has also been encountered in osteoclasts, specialized multinucleated cells of myeloid origin responsible for bone resorption. There is a fine balance between bone formation and resorption in order to maintain skeletal integrity (subject to growth and mechanical constraints), mineral homeostasis (calcium and phosphate levels) and the bone marrow environment 35. Osteoclasts hence play an essential role in maintaining the bone tissue homeostasis. These cells are adjacent to the bone and an actin ring seals their bone\u2010apposed membrane. The formation of the actin ring is regulated by microtubules and the small GTPase CDC42. The generated delimitated extracellular space is referred to as the resorptive organelle and the limiting membrane develops into a ruffled border increasing the surface through which ions, mainly protons and chloride, are pumped into the resorptive organelle in order to degrade the mineral matrix. In addition, lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin K and collagenase digest the organic components of the bone upon delivery into the resorptive organelle through the fusion of osteoclast secretory lysosomes with the ruffled border 36.",

In particular, LC3B localizes at the bone\u2010apposed membrane in association with the actin ring but is not present on secretory lysosomes, indicating an essential and direct role for LC3\u2010II in the process 38 (Figure 2). This observation has led to the hypothesis that LC3\u2010II\u2010decorated membranes promote fusion with secretory lysosomes in analogy with the role of LC3 in LAP. More recently, it has been shown that LC3 associates with microtubules in proximity of the actin ring and regulates CDC42 37. These data thus suggest that the pool of LC3\u2010II at the ruffled border could be a structural and/or a functional link between CDC42 microtubules, which are known to be essential for the initiation of the actin ring formation.",

They belong to the order of the Nidovirales and to the family of the Coronaviridae 48. After entry, they induce the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) to which they target their replication and transcription complex 49. The exact source of DMVs membranes still remains elusive although several lines of evidence, including ultrastructural studies 50, support an ER origin. A possible role for autophagy in the generation of DMVs was proposed as the morphology of their double\u2010lipid bilayers is reminiscent of autophagosomes 51. However, conflicting results on the recruitment of LC3 onto DMVs membranes and the requirement of ATG5 for virus replication led to some confusion 52, 53, 54, 55. The issue was clarified by a series of experiments showing that MHV probably hijacks LC3\u2010I\u2010positive EDEMosome membranes 45 (Figure 2). Thus, similarly to EDEMosomes, MHV replication requires LC3 (in its non\u2010lipidated form, i.e. LC3\u2010I) but not an intact autophagy pathway. LC3\u2010I is non\u2010covalently associated to the MHV\u2010induced DMVs, which are distinct from the LC3\u2010II\u2010positive autophagosomes, and knockdown of LC3A and LC3B or SEL1L severely impairs MHV replication. Moreover, while the DMVs lack conventional ER protein markers, they contain EDEM1 and OS\u20109. Together these lines of evidence have led to the hypothesis that CoV usurp the ERAD tuning pathway in order to form the DMVs essential for their replication 45. Whether the CoV exploit the totality or part of the ERAD tuning machinery and how these viruses generate DMVs from single membrane vesicles, e.g. the EDEMosomes, remains to be understood.",

The probable unspecific and pleiotropic effects of these treatments, which might be responsible for the C. trachomatis growth impairment, later discredited these results. Still, localization of endogenous LC3 at the periphery of the inclusions indicated the engagement of autophagy. Pachikara and colleagues 61 were the first to suggest that C. trachomatis had a more subtle interplay with the autophagy as neither the induction of this pathway by starvation or rapamycin, nor its inhibition upon ATG5 knockout had an effect on chlamydial life cycle. This notion was confirmed through the precise characterization of LC3 recruitment onto the inclusion membrane 62. Similarly to the ERAD tuning, only the LC3\u2010I form of endogenous LC3 decorated the inclusions whereas GFP\u2010LC3 failed to be recruited onto them (Figure 2). Moreover LC3 knockdown decreased bacterial progeny as well as inclusion size and infectivity. Interestingly LC3 and its interaction partners, the microtubule\u2010associated protein 1A and 1B (MAP1), colocalize with the bacterial inclusions situated in proximity of the Golgi at late time points during infection but not with the inclusions dispersed in the cytoplasm shortly after infection. Together with the observation that LC3 and MAP1 required microtubules to associate with the inclusion, these results suggest that the probable function of LC3 in C. trachomatis life cycle is mediating the relocalization of the inclusion in a microtubule\u2010dependent manner.

Activated macrophages, however, can limit replication, kill and clear this pathogen through two independent mechanisms 68. The first involves the activation of autophagy by CD40\u2010CD40L signaling while the second mechanism entails the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced disruption and stripping of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, followed by the clearance of the damaged parasite and membranous debris.

In particular, T. gondii\u2010infected atg5\u2010deficient macrophages exposed to IFN\u2010\u03b3/LPS display intact parasitophorous vacuoles and they are consequently unable to clear the invading parasites 69. It appears that the lack of ATG5 hinders the rapid recruitment of IIGP1 onto the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. IIGP1 is instead found on intracellular vesicles, thus leading to the hypothesis of an impairment of this protein trafficking to the T. gondii vacuole in absence of ATG5. The involvement of autophagy in this process was excluded mostly through EM examinations, which failed to detect membrane structures resembling autophagosomes in proximity of the parasitophorous vacuole 69. While the cellular localization of LC3 in the atg5 knockout and control cells has not been investigated in this study, an earlier report revealed accumulations of LC3 onto disrupted parasitophorous vacuoles in the vicinity of intense IIGP1 signals in T. gondii\u2010infected, IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010stimulated astrocytes 70.

Recently, Lee et al. 78 have identified another function of ATG7 in response to metabolic stresses that is autophagy\u2010independent. Nutrient deprivation stimulates the exit from the cell division cycle, in particular from the S\u2010phase. ATG7 is required for this exit from the S\u2010phase but also to efficiently express the cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitor (CDI) p21CDKN1A\n78, which prevents cell cycle progression. This unconventional role of ATG7 is autophagy\u2010independent because it does not require the E1\u2010like conjugation activity of this protein. Moreover neither BECLIN1 knockdown or atg5\n\u2212/\u2212 knockout cells display abnormal exit from the S\u2010phase upon nutrient starvation. The role of ATG7 in the cell cycle arrest relies on its ability to bind to p53 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The association between ATG7 and p53 is enhanced by metabolic stresses and together with p53, ATG7 binds to the promoter of p21CDKN1A gene inducing its expression (Figure 3D). Conversely, in the absence of ATG7, p53 induces the expression of pro\u2010apoptotic genes, which eventually trigger cell death pathways. atg7\n\u2212/\u2212 knockout cells also showed increased radical oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser20, which are features indicating an activation of the DNA damage response pathway that eventually leads to a p53\u2010mediated cell death 79. Indeed genetic blocking of the DNA damage response mediated by the ROS\u2010CHK2\u2010p53 pathway was beneficial for the survival of the atg7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice.

BECLIN1 was the first ATG protein that linked autophagy with tumor development as mono\u2010allelic loss of BECLIN1 can be observed in many tumors 81. Loss of BECLIN1 in tumor cells is accompanied with chromosomal instability and centrosomal abnormalities 82, 83. During mitosis BECLIN1 localizes to the kinetochore complex in a microtubule\u2010dependent manner and it binds ZWINT\u20101 at this location (Figure 3C). ZWINT\u20101 is a component of the KNL\u20101/MIS12/NDC80 (KMN) complex, which mediates the interaction between the kinetochore and microtubules 84. Acting downstream of the KMN complex, BECLIN1 participates in the association of the kinetochore proteins and the subsequent anchoring of microtubules to the kinetochore (Figure 3C). As a result, depletion of BECLIN1 causes a defect in the kinetochore protein assembling, misalignment of chromosomes and a general block in mitotic progression. This novel mitosis\u2010specific function of BECLIN1 is independent of its function in autophagy or as a component of the PdtIns3K complex because downregulation of components of the PtdIns3K complex such as VPS34, VPS15 and UVRAG, or other ATG proteins including ATG5 or LC3 did not have negative effects on mitosis progression 82. Moreover the depletion of these proteins did not alter the cellular levels of the kinetochore proteins or BECLIN1 subcellular distribution during mitosis 82. Thus, in addition to its involvement in autophagy, one possibility could be that BECLIN1 controls tumor development and progression by also regulating chromosomal congressing during mitosis. This could, at least in part, explain why BECLIN1 is the mostly frequently ATG gene found altered in cancers and possibly why its knockout is embryonically lethal in mice while the ablation of most of the other ATG genes is not.",

Yousefi and colleagues 85 have reported that a truncated form of this protein is involved in promoting apoptotic cell death. Apoptotic stimuli, like the CD95 ligand or anticancer drugs stimulate the activation of calpains, calcium\u2010dependent non\u2010lysosomal cysteine proteases, which also cleave full\u2010length ATG5 (33 kDa) at threonine 193 (Figure 3A). The resulting 24 kDa truncated form of ATG5 associates with mitochondria and triggers cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase 3 activation through a still unknown mechanism. In addition to its translocation onto mitochondria, truncated ATG5 binds to BCL\u2010XL in apoptotic cells, and thereby it possibly blocks its anti\u2010apoptotic activity. Importantly, the overexpression of truncated ATG5 does not stimulate autophagy, which suggests that the truncated and the full\u2010length ATG5 forms have separate biological roles. The involvement of autophagy in promoting cell death is a very controversial topic but recent reports support the notion that autophagy is in general not a cause for cell death 86, 87. Unconventional functions of ATG proteins, in contrast, may well promote and/or contribute to cell death. Thus, the function of the ATG5 can switch from being required for protective autophagy towards triggering apoptosis. Moreover the processing of ATG5 could also have inhibitory effect on autophagy by depleting the pool of this protein involved in this pathway thus further enhancing cell death. Similarly to ATG5, BECLIN 1 processing by caspase 3 also appears to generate a fragment with pro\u2010apoptotic properties 88, 89.",

This has somehow biased the investigation of the cellular functions of the ATG proteins, but studies on their role particularly in immunity and infections have been fundamental in revealing that they are key components in other pathways as well. The emerging picture is that ATG proteins are part of these processes sometimes as the only component of the ATG machinery and sometimes together with their functional ATG gene cluster 19. Posttranslational modifications, such as lipidation, conjugation to other proteins and proteolytic processing, appear to be central in regulating and coordinating the different functions of each ATG gene products. A clear example of this multitask versatility is LC3 (Figure 2). Its lipidation and targeting to autophagosomal membranes require all ATG functional gene clusters 93. While the exact function of lipidated LC3 (LC3\u2010II) remains to be determined, its molecular characteristics are very likely exploited in LAP, establishment of the ruffled borders by osteoclasts (Figure 2), and possibly for trafficking though the Golgi apparatus 94, 95. Not surprisingly, the factors mediating the formation of LC3\u2010II, including the ATG12 conjugation system, are also involved in these processes. In contrast, the functions of LC3\u2010I in the ERAD tuning, the formation of coronaviral DMVs and subcellular redistribution of Chlamydia inclusions appear to implicate none of the other ATG components but rather the ability of this protein to interact with microtubules, at least in the context of the two infections 18, 62, 96. The fact that LC3\u2010I and LC3\u2010II have very divers molecular features and probably interact with different sets of partners is also underlined by the observation that tagging of LC3 at its N\u2010terminus is not interfering with the functions of LC3\u2010II but abolishes those of LC3\u2010I 12, 23, 38, 42, 45, 62.",

Historically the atg5\u2010 and atg7\u2010knockout mice were the first the first generated atg gene knockout animals 76, 77, and as a result they were pivotal in revealing the unconventional functions of these two genes and the two ubiquitin\u2010like systems. Mouse models that lack most of the other ATG genes are now available, and they will also be a key tool to shed light into the physiological roles of the ATG proteins beyond autophagy. Nonetheless, a current certitude is that the role of autophagy cannot be exclusively assessed by depleting one single ATG protein or even a few of them that belong to the same functional group (Figure 1B). Thus, while most of the researchers are not yet familiar with the unconventional functions of the ATG genes; their discovery has already influenced our experimental approach to study autophagy.",

            "text": "Figure 1: \nThe mechanism of canonical autophagy and the conventional functions of the ATG proteins. A) The mechanism of autophagy. Upon induction, the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis entail the formation of the phagophore through the orchestrated action of the ULK complex, the PtdIns3K complex and other factors including ATG9, VMP1, AMBRA1, DFCP1 and the WIPI proteins. Subsequently the ATG12 and LC3 conjugation systems are key in mediating the expansion and nucleation of the phagophore into an autophagosome, an event that allows the sequestration of the cargo targeted for degradation. Once complete, autophagosomes first fuse with endosomal compartments to mature into amphisomes before fusing with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Resident hydrolases (indicated with scissors) consume the autophagosomal cargo and internal vesicles into metabolites (amino acids, sugars, nucleotides and other basic molecules), which are subsequently transported into the cytoplasm by permeases and possibly other transporters (depicted as small violet pipes), where they are used as either a source of energy or as building blocks for the synthesis of new macromolecules. B) The key autophagy proteins and their organization in functional gene clusters. The ULK complex and the autophagy\u2010specific class III PtdIns3K complex, plus other factors, are involved in the initiation of autophagosome biogenesis (highlighted in red in panel A) whereas the ATG12\u2010 and LC3\u2010conjugation systems are mostly involved in the phagophore elongation (highlighted in violet in panel A). While the yeast homologues of the ATG2A, ATG9A and WIPI are interacting, there is no evidence this also holds true for their mammalian counterparts. Moreover, there are no indications that DFCP1 associate with these components. The yeast homologs of the mammalian ATGs proteins are indicated in between brackets. Adapted from 4.",

After post\u2010translational processing by ATG4, LC3\u2010I is covalently linked to PE to generate LC3\u2010II through the action of two ubiquitin\u2010like conjugation systems. The formation of lipidated LC3 is essential for autophagosome formation by mediating the expansion of the phagophore. LC3\u2010II is also involved in LAP as well as the specialized secretion by osteoclasts, which is essential for the establishment of the ruffled borders for bone resorption. The role of LC3\u2010II in these two latter pathways is unclear, but its localization and function do not require an intact ATG machinery. Precursor LC3\u2010I is also carrying out cellular functions, which do not appear to involve most of the other ATG proteins. LC3\u2010I is recruited together with MAP1 proteins onto Chlamydia inclusions and allows the redistribution of these bacteria\u2010containing compartments in proximity of the Golgi through its interaction with the microtubules. LC3\u2010I is also associated with the surface of the EDEMosomes via its interaction with the protein cargo receptor Sel1L. The role of LC3\u2010I in the ERAD tuning pathway remains unknown, but it could act as an adaptor for either a protein vesicle coat or the cytoskeleton network. Viruses, such as MHV and EAV, hijack this transport route to generate their replicative DMVs, which are also decorated with LC3\u2010I (red arrow). LC3\u2010I is essential for both the ERAD tuning and the replication of these viruses. In this latter context, LC3\u2010I could mediate the microtubule\u2010dependent subcellular redistribution of DMVs.",

            "text": "Figure 3: \nThe unconventional roles of\nATG\nproteins in cell death and cell division and proliferation. A) Apoptotic stimuli activate calpains and one of the substrates of these proteases is ATG5. The resulting 24 kDa truncated form of ATG5 (24K\u2010ATG5) associates with mitochondria and triggers cytochrome c release through a still unknown mechanism, thus participating to the initiation of the cell death programs. B) ATG12 participates in apoptosis at least in two distinct ways. First, it can become part of the ATG12\u2010ATG3 conjugate, which plays an important role in controlling mitochondria homeostasis and sensitizes cells to apoptosis triggered by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. The ATG12\u2010ATG3 conjugate is also stimulated upon vaccinia virus infection and it is required for the life cycle of this virus (red arrow). Second and independently from its capacity to be covalently linked to ATG5 or ATG3, ATG12 stimulates mitochondrial apoptosis through its binding and inhibition of the anti\u2010apoptotic function of the members of the BCL\u20102 protein family. C) During mitosis BECLIN1 associates with ZWINT\u20101 and mediates the interaction between the kinetochore and microtubules, a key event in cell division. Depletion of BECLIN1 causes a defect in the kinetochore protein assembling, misalignment of chromosomes and a general block in mitotic progression. D) Upon metabolic stress, ATG7 is found associated with p53 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The nuclear complex positively regulates the expression of genes mediating the cell cycle arrest. It remains to be determined whether the nuclear ATG7\u2010p53 pool results from the translocation into the nucleus of the subpopulation of this complex formed in the cytoplasm (dashed arrow).",
