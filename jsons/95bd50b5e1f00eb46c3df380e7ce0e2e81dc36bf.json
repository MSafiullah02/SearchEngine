Equine ontogeny reveals that the essential features of a mature immune system are established by about IS weeks while the foetus is maintained within its sterile environment (Penyman, McGuire and Torbeck 1980) . The maturity of the equine foetal immune response has been shown by the production of antibody to antigenic challenge in uter-o with live attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis vaccine or xenogeneic erythrocytes (Morgan, Bryans and Mock 1975; Mock, Morgan, Jochin and Lock 1978) . Recent studies have shown that high levels of antibody and specific cellular immune responses can be generated to protein antigens by immunisation of the equine foetus (Hannant et ul 1991b) . The potential of mature immune responses in the equine foetus could explain the occasional finding of pathogen-specific antibody in foetal circulation or in foetuses aborted for non-infectious reasons (Whitwell, Bowen and Hannant 1991) .",

This source of passive immunity combined with physical barriers to infection and other non-specific (innate) immunological responses i s generally sufficient to allow the foal to survive and develop specific primary immunological responses during the first few weeks of life. However, passively acquired and actively achieved immunological mechanisms of the young foal are not always sufficient to prevent infectious agents becoming established in an otherwise healthy individual.

Classification of equine immunoglobulins has been rather conflicting over succeeding years but current consensus supports the designation of seven antigenically distinct groups.

This is important to understand because these are the sites where effective immune responses must function if infection and systemic spread is to be prevented. There is accumulating evidence that both humoral and cellular immune responses are stimulated in horses after natural and experimental infection with respiratory pathogens. What is not clear. however, i s the role played by each type of immune response in protection. A common finding is that a particular antibody response is generated after infection and the progressive increase in circulating antibody often coincides with a reduction in the clinical signs of disease. It is very tempting to infer that the antibody has neutralised the progressing infection and sometimes (unfortunately) it is assumed that the antibody so-generated will protect the horse from further infection. Clearly, this rationale is faulty and takes no account of the contribution of other types of antibody (eg secreted directly from the respiratory mucosal surfaces) or cellular immune responses.",

            "text": "It is now becoming apparent that a number of alternative routes exist in an infected cell for processing and degrading microbial antigens that affect markedly the immune responses that are generated (Weiss and Bogen 1991) . For example, it is a common premise that infection by a pathogen stimulates much higher levels of immunity than exposure to inactivated antigens. The levels of cytotoxic effector and memory lymphocytes are much higher after infection exposure to influenza A viruses than after immunisation with inactivated whole virus, which is in turn more effective at stimulating immunity than virus subunit antigens (Askonas, McMichael and Webster 1982) . The gradation in immunity produced is largely a function of the method by which virus antigens are processed and delivered to T lymphocytes. Details of antigen processing and the stimulation of immune effector cells can be found in Momson's review (p 6). In brief, infection with live virus usually results in endogenous processing of viral antigens and stimulation of MHC class-I restricted cytotoxic effector cells that bear the CD8+ surface marker phenotype. The outcome of this interaction is cytolytic damage to the infected target cell (Randall and Souberbielle 1990) . Exogenous processing of microbial antigens (eg by phagocytosis of virionsbacteria or partially degraded antigens) usually results in the stimulation of responding T cells, which are restricted by the MHC class-I1 elements of the processing cell. Lymphocytes that show class-I1 restriction express surface markers of the CD4+ type that are phenotypic of helper T cells (Gay et a1 1987) and are important for local amplification of cellular and humoral immune responses and for stimulation of memory lymphocytes.",

The severity of clinical signs and levels of nasopharyngeal shedding of virus are related to the infectious virus dose. This provides a good controlled experimental system for evaluating immune responses. Early information about the duration of natural immunity or the immunity stimulated by experimental infection with equine influenza viruses suggested that high levels of antibody were required for protection (Rouse and Ditchfield 1970; Kumanomido and Akyama 1975) . These findings were in accord with the studies on vaccine-induced immunity (Kumanomido and Akiyama 1975; Mumford et a1 1983) . In contrast, re-challenge experiments in ponies previously infected with influenza showed that recently exposed animals with high levels of antibody and ponies with low levels of antibody, which had been infected up to 62 weeks previously, were protected (Hannant et a1 1988a) . These observations highlight an important difference between infectioninduced immunity and that provided by conventional inactivated v i m vaccines where clinical immunity correlates strongly with levels of circulating antibody to the virus haemagglutinin (Wood et a1 1983; Mumford et a1 1983; Mumford, Wood, Folkers and Schild 1988) . Similar findings have been made with human influenza where potent immunity to re-infection is established after natural or experimentally-induced primary infection (Johnson et a1 1986) , which can last for several years. In fact, Ada and Jones (1986) suggested that T cell memory to human influenza could be maintained for 10 years or more. However, when considering the duration of immunity, it is important to differentiate between the demonstration of immunological memory by in vitro tests and the immunologically mediated protection from second infection shown in primed individuals.",

A well-developed mucosal immune system has been described in horses (Mair, Batten, Stokes and Bourne 1987a) and antibody has been detected in respiratory secretions of clinically normal horses (Mair, Stokes and Bourne 1987b) . It has been difficult to ascribe functional significance to nasopharyngeal antibody in equine influenza because although it is stimulated by infection (Rouse and Ditchfield 1970; Kumanomida and Akyama 1975) , there is no direct evidence to show that local antibody is protective in isolation from high background levels of serum antibody. The independence of local and circulating antibody responses to equine influenza can be inferred from their different kinetics. However, animals that were protected from infection did not show unusually high levels of nasal antibody pre-challenge, although they did show local antibody memory (Hannant, Jessett, ONeill and Mumford 1989) . It is difficult to assess the importance of locally produced antibody in sites where tissue inflammation is a feature of infection and transudation of serum antibody is likely to occur (Wagner et a1 1987) . Local antibody production in the equine nasopharynx accounts for 15 to 60 per cent of the total antibody recovered from nasal wash samples after influenza infection and, as with other species, IgA is the isotype with the longest duration (Hannant et a1 1989) .",

The existence of the common mucosal immune system in horses provides an alternative method for stimulating respiratory mucosal antibody independent of systemic (serum) antibody. It is well documented that the intestine responds to antigenic challenge by production of IgA-committed precursor B cells from the Peyer's patches and that these cells migrate via the efferent intestinal lymph and the thoracic duct to the blood stream (Bienenstock, McDermott, Befus and O'Neill 1978) . Antigen-specific precursor cells leave the circulation and return to the intestine and other mucosal sites such as the respiratory and reproductive tracts (Pahud and Mach 1972; Widders, Stokes, David and Bourne 1985) . Specific targeting of mucosal immunity should be improved by enhancing the uptake of antigen into mucosal associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) and this can be achieved by the use of a receptor mediated uptake system based on cholera toxin.",

Hannant, T. O'Neill and J. A. Mumford, unpublished data) . Similar results were obtained with direct application of virus toxin conjugates intranasally and studies are now in progress to measure the virus neutralising activity of locally induced antibody. Some recent work shows that the adjuvant effect of cholera toxin is not affected by the individual or strain variation of the immunised animal. Therefore, it has great potential as a vaccine adjuvant in genetically diverse animals such as horses (Hirabayashi et a/ 1991) . Stimulation of the immune responses at the first site of virus infection would appear to be a logical approach to the design of immunoprophylactic agents. The technique has wide application and theoretically, can be used with any infectious agent that invades mucosal surfaces. This may be particularly useful for agents such as Stwptocmws equi where protection from infection seems to be related to local rather than systemic immunity (Galan and Timoney 1985a. b ).",

These 'hybrid' viruses have the capacity to attach to and infect equine cells but virus replication is much reduced. However, the reassortant virus will survive long enough to stimulate an immune response to the equine virus antigens and it is hoped that this will protect from challenge infection with native equine virus. This technique has proved valuable in animal models where significant resistance to rechallenge with native virus has been demonstrated (Murphy et a/ 1982) .

Type 1 (EHV-I) is associated with respiratory disease, abortion and neurological conditions that can vary from incoordination to paralysis (Allen and Bryans 1986) , whereas type 4 (EHV-4) is mainly associated with respiratory disease (Patel, Edington and Mumford 1982) . Horses experience first infection at a young age (Bryans 1969) and can suffer repeated exposures/infections throughout their lives. It is generally considered that immunity to infection is short-lived but the height and duration of immune responses increase after re-infection (Doll 1961) . A major problem with EHV-I is that serum neutralising antibody does not protect from re-infection (Mumford et a/ 1987 ) and, although specific components of cellular and local (respiratory tract) immunity develop after infection, their relation to protection is unknown. If natural infection is so ineffective, it is a major research problem to design immunoprophylactic measures to combat EHV-I.",

By the time this article appears, antibodies will be available to identify a variety of equine lymphocyte subsets including the description of CD4 and CD8 markers. This is a very exciting time for researchers in equine immunology because it will soon be possible not only to differentiate the major types of equine lymphocytes, but to purify particular cells for detailed functional studies. For example, monoclonal antibodies to equine CD markers can be used to kill or inhibit the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes in vitro (O'Brien, Holmes, Duffus and Lunn 1991) .

Briefly, the viral genes coding for most of the important virus envelope glycoproteins have been isolated and the gene products are being expressed in bacteria or as recombinant glycoproteins using vaccinia virus. Many of these studies have been carried out through international collaborations between the UK, Ireland, USA and Australia. Part of this collaboration has been to examine the equine cellular immune response to one particular EHV-I glycoprotein in great detail. A study is underway to dissect the equine T helper lymphocyte responses to very small fragments (peptides) of this glycoprotein to identify the dominant peptidedpeptide combinations. Because the gene and the glycoprotein sequences are now known, it has been possible to synthesise multiple peptides that encompass all the proteins contained within the entire glycoprotein molecule. These peptides have been prepared in Kentucky and shipped to Newmarket where detailed studies on equine T lymphocyte responses are underway. Because studies in molecular biology and immunology are expensive and many researchers share the same broad objectives, the important research on EHV-I will be of a similar collaborative nature.",

Bacterial virulence is thought to be associated with the M-like protein that stimulates formation of antibodies in affected animals (Woolcock 1974) . Studies on the equine immune response to S. equi have shown that resistance to infection appears to be independent of the levels of bactericidal antibody in the serum (Galan and Timoney 1985a ) but is related to the level of mucosal pharyngeal immune responses to the protein antigens of S. equi. Existing vaccines for strangles comprise killed organisms or extracts presumed to be rich in M-like protein, but they afford little protection, mainly because high levels of serum antibody are stimulated but pharyngeal mucosal immune responses are not (Galan and Timoney 1985a; Timoney and Eggers 1985) .",

A novel approach using recombinant DNA technology has been to develop avirulent strains of Salmonella to carry heterologous antigens for stimulating mucosal immunity (Dougan, Hormaeche and Maskell 1987) . After oral administration, S. typhirnuriurn is known to invade and proliferate in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which leads to the development of immune responses at other mucosal sites (Bienenstock et a/ 1978). Thus, the equine common mucosal immune system can be exploited in much the same way as for inactivated virus vaccines (see above). Avirulent strains of S. typhirnuriurn that contain the M protein gene of S. equi (Galan, Timoney and Curtis 1988) have been prepared. These bacteria express high levels of M protein in culture and experiments are in progress to study their potential as immunogens in horses. Safety aspects will be important here because S. equi M protein is involved in the pathogenesis of purpura haemorrhagica (Galan and Timoney 1985b) . Therefore, it is important that the new vaccines stimulate protective immunity against strangles without increasing the risk of immune-complex-related diseases associated with M protein.",

However, several leads from medical research and experimental animal studies should be followed up to develop both rapid serological diagnostic tests and effective vaccines. Serology is used routinely to diagnose S. pneurnoniae serotypes in man (Gillespie 1989 ) and capsular antigens may be detected in the serum and urine of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia by a serotype-specific latex agglutination test (O'Neill et a1 1989) . Serological diagnosis of S. pneurnoniue has been reported only rarely in horses (Mackintosh eta/ 1988) . Current research is directed toward development of tests suitable for serosurveys of the prevalence of S. pneurnoniue in Thoroughbreds (J. Wood and D. Hannant, unpublished data) . This information will help to identify the frequency of asymptomatic persistent carriers. High levels of antibody to CPS correlate with protection in other species (Gillespie 1989) . but there is no evidence that respiratory tract antibody protects from infection with S. pneurnoniae, although mucosal immunity is important in protection from S. equi (above) and other streptococcal infections (Czerkisky et a/ 1989) . Therefore, it appears that the generation and duration of antibody responses to CPS offer the best first approach to targeting effective vaccines for S . pneurnoniue in horses, particularly as the important cellular immune responses seem to be related to the regulation of antibody to CPS.",

The respiratory route of infection is the most likely to cause the progressive pulmonary lesions associated with R. equi pneumonia in foals . Zink, Yager, Prescott and Fernando (1987) suggested that R. equi causes pneumonia in foals by persistent intracellular infection of alveolar macrophages. Pneumonia induced by R. equi is usually restricted to foals, but older horses that are immunocompromised or suffering concurrent infections also can be affected. Neither healthy adult horses (Yager 1987) nor foals as young as three weeks of age (Machang'u and Prescott 1991) Several attempts have been made to protect foals from R. equi infection using inactivated bacteria or bacterial extracts as vaccines.",

Initially it would appear that live attenuated vaccines or recombinant viral/bacterial vaccines offer the best chances for stimulating strong immune responses. These responses should be of the same levels as those achieved by natural infection, but should occur without the associated pathological damage. Although this scenario is attractive, there are a number of fundamental and applied problems that may delay the universal adoption of this type of technology. Firstly, a large amount of basic research needs to be done to identify the important antigens that should be expressed in the recombinant vaccine vectors. Moreover, the immune responses stimulated should be the ones already identified as being important in protection or recovery. We have already seen that generation of high levels of circulating antibody may have little relevance to generation of immunity. Secondly, once a desired antigen(s) has been targetted as being appropriate for expression in a recombinant vaccine system, it is important to know that the vector will be acceptable in the target species. With the Thoroughbred horse, the side reactions associated with the use of vaccinia or other pox virus vectors may limit the usefulness of these techniques. One problem is that of the possible severe reactions to secondaryhooster injections. Because the immune response to vaccinia virus is very strong, it is feared that immunity to vaccinia virus within the equine population will increase and that there would be inappropriate reactions to second injections. Therefore, the recombinant vaccine would need to be good enough to stimulate long-term immunity after a single vaccination.",

Does this mean that these vaccines need to be polyvalent, carry all anticipated antigens and produce life-long immunity after one inoculation? Some recent studies with experimental animals show that pre-existing immunity to vaccinia virus is detrimental to protection from influenza (Andrew 1989 ) and herpes simplex virus (Rooney ef al 1988) induced by vaccinia recombinant vaccines. The former study also showed the inverse relationship between the level of pre-existing immunity to the viral vector at the time of immunisation and the level of protection induced by the recombinant vaccine.",
