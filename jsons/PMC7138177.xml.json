            "text": "Understanding the nature of science (NOS), especially the key features of the scientific endeavour, has long been regarded as a major component of science literacy and an important objective of science curricula in many countries (e.g. American Association for the Advancement of Science 1993; Council of Ministers of Education 1997; Millar and Osborne 1998)1 However, it has been consistently reported that many students, and even many teachers, do not possess adequate NOS understanding (Lederman 1992; Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman 2000; Moss et al. 2001; Finson 2002). While there have been many attempts to improve teachers\u2019 understanding of NOS, Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman (2000) report that little success has been achieved. Their critical review suggests that \u2018approaches that utilise elements from history and philosophy of science and/or direct instruction on NOS are more effective in achieving that end than approaches that utilise science process-skills instruction or non-reflective inquiry-based activities\u2019 (p. 694). The authors also point out that while there might be compelling theoretical arguments to support the effectiveness of history of science and philosophy of science in improving learners\u2019 NOS conceptions, further empirical research is essential. Among research efforts in this direction, Irwin (2000) demonstrates encouraging results with a group of 14-year-old students by integrating substantial amounts of historical material into the topic of Atoms and the Periodic Table. Lin and Chen (2002) also provide empirical evidence of positive impact on understanding of NOS among a group of prospective chemistry teachers by integrating historical cases into a pre-service teacher education programme.",

(2004) have investigated the effectiveness of promoting NOS understanding among high school students and pre-service teachers by providing the authentic research experience of working with practicing scientists. Results show that better understanding of NOS and the nature of scientific inquiry do not necessarily result from doing science per se (Bell et al. 2003). There also need to be frequent opportunities for reflection on NOS in the context of that authentic scientific research experience through journal writing and seminars (Schwartz et al. 2004). In their recent comparison of the epistemic beliefs of chemistry students and research chemists, Samarapungavan et al. (2006) come to the broadly similar conclusion that apprenticeship experiences are no automatic guarantee of epistemic development in students. They suggest that engaging students and expert researchers in conversation and reflection on epistemic issues related to research work will have a greater chance of success.",

            "text": "While apprenticeship or internship experiences offer enormous potential for enhancing NOS understanding, they create major logistical problems\u2014especially in East Asian classrooms, where class size is routinely about 40, and may be as high as 50 or 60. Our response has been to present students with insight into authentic scientific practice through the development of a case study of contemporary scientific practice. A detailed review of 17 experimental studies of context-based or STS-oriented approaches at secondary school level by Bennett et al. (2007) indicates that such approaches have positive impact on students\u2019 understanding of scientific concepts and attitudes to science and school science, especially when attention focuses on recent scientific research and innovations. While none of these studies focused specifically on NOS understanding, there is good reason to anticipate similarly favourable learning outcomes with respect to learning about science and scientific inquiry. Indeed, there are compelling arguments that critical consideration of socioscientific issues provides an ideal forum for students to deploy and develop their NOS understanding (Sadler 2004; Sadler and Zeidler 2005; Zeidler et al. 2005), especially when the issues are controversial (Kolstoe 2000; Oulton et al. 2004) or have strong personal relevance (Ryder 2002). Khishfe and Lederman (2006) remind us that although locating NOS teaching within controversial topics (in their case, discussion of global warming) can be effective, the essential requirement, as in internship and apprenticeship approaches, is that NOS teaching is both explicit and supportive of critical reflection. The case study described here focuses on an episode that was intensely personal for our students and had many controversial aspects. Moreover, the learning materials were designed to draw explicit attention to important NOS items and to encourage reflection.",

This occurred immediately after the WHO became aware of the seriousness of the epidemic.We knew that it was a race against time, so we had to find very quickly the pathogen, the causative agent for this disease.

We will show a video clip showing that immediately following the announcement on 18 March 2003 by a group of scientists from Hong Kong and Germany that the virus causing SARS was paramyxovirus, other research groups around the world quickly announced that they had also found evidence that paramyxovirus was the causative agent of SARS. However, only a few days later, on 22 March 2003, another group of researchers in Hong Kong announced that further evidence showed that coronavirus, rather than paramyxovirus, is the causative agent of SARS. Immediately after this announcement, several laboratories, including Rotterdam, Frankfurt and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, also confirmed the coronavirus theory. This episode illustrates the theory-laden nature of observation and shows how scientists\u2019 expectations or predictions influence what they see and how they interpret the data.

Disagreements and arguments among scientists are common and an inevitable stage in the journey towards more established and well-accepted scientific knowledge.

Researchers were assigned different tasks. Some were in charge of data collection, e.g. some studied the anamesis such as when the patient got infected, when the patient was hospitalised and when the patient got his first fever. Some were responsible for cultivating the virus. Some were responsible for studying the gene of the cultivated virus and extracting the RNA. Another group then turned the RNA to DNA. The next group would then sequence the DNA, whereas another group analysed the sequence.Research in molecular biology often involves the deployment of skills and expertise in a series of highly focused areas. Dr. KT illustrated it using an analogy with shoe-making. In the old days, the whole shoe was produced by a shoe-maker, but in modern times each stage of production is completed by a group of workers who then pass it on to the next group along the production line. The scale of research in molecular biology has grown so much that it has become almost impossible for a researcher to be skilful in all tasks. Thus collaboration within a research team is essential. To be successful, scientists also need to be aware of work done by other groups and be willing to use it to advance their own thinking.",

            "text": "One of the most pervasive myths of science is the notion that a common series of steps is adopted by all research scientists in all situations (McComas 1998). This is probably a direct consequence of the \u2018scientific method\u2019 occupying such a prominent position in the introductory chapters of science textbooks encountered by students at the very outset of their formal learning in science. Many students and teachers consider that making a hypothesis is an essential component of this stepwise generation of scientific knowledge (Watson et al. 1999). However, the interview with Prof. DL concerning the decoding of the genomic sequence of the SARS-coronavirus provided a clear counter example:After we knew that coronavirus was the causative agent of SARS, we did the sequencing, and no hypothesis was needed during this process, we just sequenced it\u2026 Right, like the human genome project which sequences our three billion base pairs, it\u2019s not hypothesis-driven.This type of knowledge generation without making hypotheses is increasingly common in newer fields of science such as molecular biology. With recent advances in technology, most of the tedious data collection is now done by high-speed computers, and data collection which previously took months to complete now only takes minutes. The much reduced data generation time makes meticulous hypothesizing and theorizing before actual experimenting less important than in the past. Scientific investigations in which data are obtained first and then interesting problems are identified by \u2018data mining\u2019 have become much more common in recent years.",

This interview episode reinforces the point that competition among scientists, particularly from different research groups, is a significant aspect of science and should no longer be ignored in the school curriculum. Indeed, many of the scientists we interviewed mentioned that their greatest pressure and concern in their research work comes from the limitations of resources and funding that might compromise their capacity to compete with other research groups. Some Hong Kong scientists expressed frustration about the huge difference in the number of genomic sequencers between their laboratories and the laboratories in Canada that announced the first sequence of SARS-coronavirus.",

The crucial point is that the Hong Kong team\u2019s data conflicted with the data accumulated by the highly prestigious Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of United States.Around 10 p.m., it was the last base pair...my research students didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026 In the US sequence, the first base pair of the head was an \u201cA\u201d, but ours started with a \u201cT\u201d. \u2026my students asked me if we should put an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cT\u201d. When that student asked me, I thought of one thing, this was one of the best chances for me to share with my students one of the important points, that is \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d. I stopped everyone in the team from working and asked them what we should do as the CDC sequence started with an \u201cA\u201d and ours started with a \u201cT\u201d. No one answered, as Hong Kong students are usually shy\u2026 So I told them to take out all the raw data, and we not only did a duplicate or a triplicate\u2026 Over and over again, we found that it was a \u201cT\u201d, so I said, \u201cDo we still have any doubt about whether to put an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cT\u201d?\u201d. And one student was really funny, he said, \u201cFred, CDC could not be wrong.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t care much about whether CDC could be wrong or not, our research confirmed over and over again that we started with a \u201cT\u201d instead of an \u201cA\u201d, so we should enter a \u201cT\u201d instead of an \u201cA\u201d.\u201d At about 11:30 p.m., we uploaded our sequence.This decision of Dr. FL\u2019s group to hold firmly to their own data instead of suppressing them in favour of what the prevailing authority claimed is enormously valuable in emphasizing to learners the importance of scientists being honest and not submitting to authority. Several of the video interviews with scientists included in our instructional package reveal other desirable attributes for scientists, including being meticulous, organised, sensitive to the need to collect and record data accurately, and being aware of the theory-laden nature of observations and interpretation of data.",

For example, the unprecedented decision of the Hong Kong government to suspend all schools when many parents sought to prevent their children from being infected by keeping them at home. Another unprecedented government decision was made in response to medical statisticians identifying an alarmingly high infection rate among residents in a particular residential building (Amoy Gardens). The decision was taken to isolate the building and move all residents to a rural camp site to permit a thorough and unimpeded examination of the building. The sale of civet cats was banned after researchers announced evidence which pointed to civet cats as the source of the original SARS cases in Guangdong province. When Dr. RC was talking about the data leading to the ban on eating civet cats, she put particular emphasis on the social impact of research findings. The data [including early SARS patients were mostly restaurant workers who handle wild animals and serve exotic food like civet cats; civet cats carried a coronavirus almost identical to human coronavirus] directly affected the business of merchants selling exotic animals. These people may not even have learnt science at all in their life but their lives have been heavily affected by science.Sadly, there were also some occasions when scientific research on SARS was impeded by political decisions. In mainland China, in a misguided effort to prevent widespread panic, strenuous efforts were made to conceal the true extent of the epidemic. When Dr Jiang Yanyong exposed the cover-up in a letter to a Beijing television station and Time magazine, he was arrested and detained. Dr. AC commented on this incident as follows:In Mainland China, when the government said there were no cases of SARS at the beginning of the epidemic\u2026 how could the scientists in China do research on samples collected from the SARS patients there if there were no cases?... Certainly scientific research is oftentimes controlled by the will of the government.\n",

Rather, NOS is as tentative as scientific knowledge itself (Lederman 1995). We suggest that teachers, curriculum planners and science educators engage in reconsideration of the aspects of NOS included in the school science curriculum in order to reflect more fully the practice of science in the 21st century. In particular, we would like to see much more emphasis on the need to combine and coordinate expertise in diverse scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups, the significance of affective issues and funding constraints on the conduct of research, and the complex interactions within the social, cultural and political milieu in which scientific practice is located.",
