These viral particles are obligatory in nature, which cannot replicate on their own, hence depends upon the host cellular machinery to reproduce and increase viral particles [1]. A virion is a complete functional virus that includes the genetic material, the envelope, the protein part capsid, and the membrane proteins that allow the virus to infect living tissue, bind to its host cells and gain the access [2]. Viruses can infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, some viruses have strict host specificity which can infect only single species, while other viruses have broad host ranges and can infect numerous species. The viral particles are submicron in size with size range of 50\u2013200 nm, which cannot be observed under normal microscope [3,4].",

            "text": "Corona viruses (CoVs) are the largest group of viruses that can infect mammals and various other species. The name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is derived from Latin, where the meaning is \u201ccrown\u201d or \u201cwreath\u201d. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions that have a lipid envelope studded with club-shaped fringe projections creating an image resembling solar corona [5]. These viruses belong to the order Nidovirales which include the family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. The Orthocoronavirinae are further subdivided into four groups based on the genera that include the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta CoVs. The viruses from nidovirales order possess a 5\u2032 capped, enveloped, non-segmented, single-strand positive-sense RNA viruses with unusually large RNA genome\u223c30 kb with typical sizes ranging from 80 to 120 nm [6]. These viruses are generally characterized by their spikes that protrude from their surface and follow unique replication strategy [7]. The RNA genome in CoVs is composed of six to ten open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase proteins and four main structural proteins that include spike, membrane protein, envelope protein, and nucleocapsid proteins, all of which are encoded within the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome. Where the spike proteins are involved in the viral entry and in determining host range, both membrane and envelope proteins are crucial for virus assembly. Besides, some CoVs also contain a gene which encodes hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which is a glycoprotein of approximately 60\u201365 kDa. This enzyme possesses an acetyl-esterase activity that disrupts sialic acid receptors that present in the host cell surface and help in the invasion and attachment that enhance the infectious properties of the virion. However, the more precise function of HE is still enigmatic [8,9]. The presence of helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is a distinct feature of CoVs, which is infrequent among positive-sense RNA viruses, but far more usual for negative-sense RNA viruses [10]. CoVs infect a substantial number of species and cause wide diseases such as pneumonia, hepatitis, enteritis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis, reproductive diseases, sialodacryoadenitis, polyserositis, and various other disorders [11]. The first member of CoV strain was identified in poultry flocks that caused infectious bronchitis and it was reported in 1930s [12].",

Later, HCoV-OC43 type was identified, which was thought to be responsible for 5 to 30% of human respiratory tract infections in infants, and older adults and immunocompromised individuals [13,14]. Almost 40 years later, in November 2002, a newly emerged CoV was identified as the causative reason for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and named as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It represents the first human-human transmissible pandemic disease in the 21st century. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this ailment as \u201ca worldwide health threat.\u201d The outbreak of SARS started in the southern People's Republic of China, where 5300 people were infected and killed 349 nationwide [15]. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV has no genetic relatedness to any known human CoVs known by that time [16]. SARS-CoV was eradicated from the human population by global public health response. Thereafter, the other human CoV viruses including, HCoV-NL63 and HCoVHKU1 were identified in 2004 and 2005 [11]. On the other side, another lethal zoonotic beta CoV was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and named as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) which is different from SARS-CoV, which was responsible for 858 deaths out of total 2494 confirmed cases in 27 countries according to the WHO [17]. In late December 2019, the world has witnessed another deadliest outbreak for the first time in Wuhan, China, as cluster of pneumonia cases and various degrees of respiratory illness with unknown etiology and it was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, first called as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and it was renamed as SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of its close resemblance with 2002 SARS-CoV, the disease it caused was termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [18], which had become pandemic and evolved all around the globe and spread to >203 countries and territories, by strong human-human community transmission. For the viral entry into target cells both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use similar mechanism as both of these viruses contain variable receptor-binding domain (RBD) that bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. The SARS-CoV-2 was suspected to have originated from bats and pangolins [19]. The different human CoV strains and associated diseases are listed in Table 1\n.",

S1 has a RBD which constitutes 394 glutamine residues and this is recognized by lysine 31 residues on the human ACE2 receptor that determines the cellular tropism and virus-host range, while S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. After receptor binding, S protein is subjected to enzymatic modification by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which is present at the vicinity of ACE2, induces conformational changes and fuses with the plasma membrane or enter by endocytosis [22]. The HE protein facilitates the cell entry of S protein through the mucosa [5]. For the SARS-CoV-2 entry through endocytosis, Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve), Two-pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2), and cathepsin L are considered crucial. The availability of proteases in the host such as furin, TMPRSS2, trypsin, cathepsins and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) cleave spike proteins that largely determine whether CoVs enter cells through plasma membrane or endocytosis [25].",

Highly acidic endosomal pH is needed for the fusion and eventually uncoating of the envelope [25]. Further, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm and translates into two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab that encode non-structural proteins, and form replication-transcription complex (RTC) [26]. Continuously the polymerase produces a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs and finally translates into relevant viral proteins. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi together assemble the newly formed genomic RNA, envelope, nucleocapsid and glycoproteins in vesicles thereby the virion fuses with the plasma membrane to release outside the cell. The envelope protein E has conserved the functional features, such as ion-channels and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) which is required to induce virulence [27]. The virus can infect ACE2-bearing cells in organs such as lung, esophagus, mouth, heart, intestines, bladder, and kidney [28](Fig. 3\n).",

            "text": "The phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 implicate that origin could be zoonotic probably from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan that has played a role in the early spreading but this observation remains uncertain, as the first documented patient was not linked to this Seafood market [19]. Hence, the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 is still ambiguous. Li et al., studied the molecular dating estimate by bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method based on the genomic sequences, It was estimated that the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year, respectively [32,33]. Recent pieces of evidence suggest that bats could be the possible primary reservoir but its origin is still under debate [34]. A study by Roujian Lu et al., performed next-generation sequencing from BAL or throat swab from nine patient samples and found interesting observations that the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences exhibited >99\u00b798% sequence similarity among different patient samples tested, which shows that the smaller degree of diversification. They also found an 88% similarity to bat derived SARS like CoVs including bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Interestingly, this study also compared the similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where it was observed a 79 and 50% similarity which indicates that these viruses are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, in late December Wuhan bat species were in hibernation and were not available for sale in the seafood market. This report also speculates that the initial original reservoir might be the bats transmitted to the intermediate host which were found in the market, where human is the terminal host [35]. On the other hand, Zhou et al. reported a genome sequencing of bat CoV RaTG13, and found 96.2% similarity compared with SARS-CoV-2, although its spike diverges in the RBD, hence pointed that the bats could be the natural host or reservoir [36]. Another group of researchers found evidence of CoV by genomic sequencing in dead Malayan pangolins and named it as Pangolin-CoV and found that 91.02% similarity to SARS-CoV-2, and 90.55% with Bat CoV RaTG13, have provided evidence based on serological, virological, and histopathology, and also found that there is a close relation with RBD of S1 protein and of SARS-CoV-2 which is important to interact with the ACE2 protein and indicate that pangolins could be the natural reservoirs [37]. Besides, the systematic comparison and analysis approach predicted the possibilities that the interaction between the key amino acids of S protein and ACE2 indicates that other than pangolins, snakes, and turtles could also be the potential intermediate hosts in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans [38]. Furthermore, Huang et al. have shown that the spike protein in bat CoV RaTGl3 showed 97.43% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that this might be the closest strain and pangolin is the most possible intermediate reservoir to humans. Their findings propose the aptitude for evolution with higher chances of homologous recombination between bat and pangolin CoVs and emerged as SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus with mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes [39,40]. Although differences arise in the observations, these evidences would be helpful to unravel the origin and probable intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. The origin of virus and various evidences has been described in Table 2\n.",

If the R0 is less than one the existing infection causes less than one infection, in such cases the spread declines and disappears. If R0 value equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. If R0 is >1, each existing infection may spread on an average more than one individual which may lead to dramatic increase in transmission and may result in epidemic [45]. The R0 value of SARS was ranging from 1 and 2.75, while the R0 of MERS-CoV was <1. The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China was estimated to be in the range of 2.24 to 3.58 in the early phases [46]. Steven Sanche et al. found that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be 5.7 [47]. Data from six different studies estimated that R0 could range from 1.5 to 6.49, with an average of 4.2. However, WHO estimates R0 from 1.4 to 2.5 [48]. COVID-19 affected people patients serum show SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid viral load (RNAaemia) [49] and exhibits the symptoms which include fever, coughing, sneezing, throat pain, anorexia, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting dyspnea, the other characteristics most commonly exhibited are prolonged prothrombin time and lymphopenia. However, there are documented additional fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and incidence of grand-glass opacities (an area of increased attenuation in the lung on computed tomography (CT) with preserved bronchial and vascular markings in the periphery of the lungs with haziness overlying an area of the lung) [50] in some cases which lead to increased mortality rate [51]. Recent evidence suggest that 97.5% of infected individuals develop symptoms within 11.5 days and the median incubation period to develop symptoms was estimated to be 5.1 days and 101 out of every 10,000 cases were found to develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine [52].",

            "text": "Cytokine storm refers to an aberrant or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines that lead to acute inflammation and pyrexia, which begins at a local site and spreads throughout the body via the systemic circulation. The previous out breaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have witnessed acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS and death which is accompanied by rapid virus replication that led to excessive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm [54]. Similarly, now in COVID-19 outbreak, elevated cytokine levels are observed in critically ill patients. A case report by Chen et al., has observed a markedly higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-2R, and IL-6, with remarkable reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, nearly in all 11 severe cases tested as compared to 10 moderate cases. The reduction in T lymphocyte number may further reduce the production of IFN-\u03b3 [55]. These findings are in line with Pederson et al. and Diao et al. which demonstrated that the depletion of T cells and dysfunction in COVID-19, which can be implicated with the cytokine storm through the activation of highly inflammatory macrophages that produce the inflammatory cytokines and may dampen adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, an increase in the inflammatory indicators such as D-dimer and procalcitonin were found [56,57]. Based on the clinical data by Hui Li many critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical sepsis symptoms such as cold extremities, shock weak peripheral pulses and severe metabolic acidosis and hypothesized that the viral sepsis could be one of the critical clinical manifestations in cytokine storm. However, very little is known about the involvement of Toll like receptors (TLR) [58]. In another case study, the COVID-19 patients plasma samples were analyzed for cytokines by multiplex assay, where IL-1\u03b2, IL-7, IL-10, IL-8, IL-9, basic FGF, IL1-RA, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, MCP-1, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3 were found to be elevated in both (Intensive care unit) ICU and non-ICU patients, while no apparent changes were found in the levels of IL-15, IL12p70, IL-5, Eotaxin, and RANTES when compared to healthy adults. On the other side, the higher plasma levels of IL-7, IL-2, IL-10, GSCF, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and IP-10 were observed in ICU patients in comparison with non-ICU patients. This data suggest that the disease severity might be through the involvement of cytokine storm with SARS-CoV-2 infected critically ill patients [53]. Another case series was on 138 hospitalized patients, where the symptoms are consistent with the previously mentioned case report, all of the 138 patients showed bilateral involvement, critical illness was seen in older patients with co-morbidities. Apart from these symptoms, prolonged prothrombin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in 80 and 55 patients, respectively. Another observation was a gradual increase in blood urea, creatinine levels, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts before death. The other major complications during hospitalization are shock, arrhythmia, ARDS, and acute kidney injury [59]. Chen and colleagues based on a retrospective, single-center study on 99 cases [20], subsequently, Qian and colleagues reported that in 67.03% infected patients had multilobe infiltration in 53.85% patient population and an elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was seen, further in 15.39% patients elevated levels of procalcitonin was detected. Interestingly, in one case report COVID-19 had been detected from the rectal swab, who suffered from abdominal symptoms but tested twice negative by throat swab [60]. Therefore, along with the antiviral therapy it may be crucial to use anti- inflammatory agents in treating COVID-19 patients. Theoretically, corticosteroids may suppress lung inflammation, and they have been prescribed in 72.2% of ICU patients [61] but its efficacy in treating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is still controversial as the concerns centered around their short-and long-term adverse effects as well as promotion of viral rebound and ARDS [62].Therefore, it is important to identify the cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanism behind the cytokine storm. It would also be important to elucidate the role of anti-inflammatory agents against SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation.",

Avoiding mass gatherings in enclosed spaces, maintaining the distance of at least 1 m from any person with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing, sneezing); wearing a medical mask for an adequate level of protection combined with hand hygiene frequently by using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is recommended. The people who develop a febrile illness or respiratory symptoms at any point during the quarantine period should be treated and managed as a suspected case of COVID-19 [64]. Healthcare personnel must use the personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 or FFP2 standard masks, gowns, gloves, eye protection shields to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing the care [65].",

Combination of Losartan and Lisinopril did not affect the ACE2 activity compared with Losartan alone, but on other side, ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed with Losartan alone [69]. Thus there is a lack of correlation between up and down expression of ACE2 mRNA with ACE2 activity. However, there is a debate on the use of RAS and ACE inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infections and few clinical trials are going on for the usage of Losartan among patients who have not previously administered with RAS inhibitors and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177) [70,71]. The selective ACE2 inhibitor DX600 might show beneficial results in SARS-CoV-2 infections; however its clinical significance in COVID19 has not evaluated [72]. Further, in one promising study, circulating recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein upon intravenous administration produced significant blockade of initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infections by preventing the binding of viral spike protein onto cell host cell surface ACE2 receptors [73].",

            "text": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the class of quinoline derivatives and widely used to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale [74]. It is the active constituent of the bark of Cinchona (Cinchona officinalis) plant. Apart from malaria, it can be used to treat amebiasis [75] and other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis [76] and lupus erythematosus syndrome [77]. Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit the heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemozoin. Plasmodium species continue to accumulate toxic heme, killing the parasite and exhibits antimalarial activity [78]. Whereas the antiviral activity of chloroquine is exerted by diffusing into the host cells and accumulating in endosomes, lysosomes and Galgi complexes, where it is converted into protonated form, then this moiety is deposited in organelles and further involve in raising the surrounding pH [79]. The raised pH in endosomes and lysosomes prevent viral fusion and inhibits the viral entry by endocytosis into the cells [80]. ACE2 is the target receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for viral fusion, however, chloroquine does not affect the ACE2 levels but downregulated the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 [79,81,82]. Insufficient glycosylation of ACE2 offers inefficiency to bind with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins and inhibits viral fusion [82]. Hu et al. demonstrated that Chloroquine inhibited the endocytosis mediated cell uptake of SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) [83]. In the field of Nanomedicine, Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been used extensively to understand the mechanism of Nanoparticles uptake into cells. It was used as inhibitor of Nanoparticles uptake via endocytosis pathway. Similar kind of viral particle entry through endocytosis route is proposed to be inhibited by Chloroquine [83]. The combination of Chloroquine or its derivative hydroxychloroquine with drugs like Remdesivir or Azithromycin demonstrated to produce beneficial effects against this novel virus. However, its use in SARS-CoV-2 therapy has not been approved by US FDA and there are multiple clinical trials going on to evaluate the efficacy of Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (NCT04328272, NCT04323631, NCT04315896, NCT04318444, NCT04318015, NCT04303507, NCT04321278, NCT04322123, NCT04325893, and NCT04261517). Apart from therapeutic benefits, Chloroquine exerts various side effects such as fever, chills, loss of appetite, blurred vision and insomnia [84]. Additionally, few reports indicated that Chloroquine exerts proarrhythmic effects by increasing the QT interval in the ECG patterns and decreasing the heart rate [85]. This drug cannot be indicated for the patients who suffer from retinopathy and porphyria [86,87]. Based on the promising evidences, Chloroquine may become suitable drug for SARS-CoV-2 disease. Further, to improve the efficacy, Hydroxychloroquine may be used in place of Chloroquine. There were reports suggested the superior antiviral effects of Hydroxychloroquine compared to Chloroquine with better safety profiles [88]. Further, the combinational approach along with other antiviral drugs may be designed to evaluate the efficacy. Other antimalarial drugs such as Artesunate and Artemisone found to be effective against human cytomegaloviruses, but effect of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 needs to be evaluated [89,90]. Moreover, the severe inflammatory cytokine storm observed in multiple organs may be curtailed by Chloroquine due to its immunomodulatory effects.",

It shows antibacterial activity by binding to bacterial 50s ribosomal subunit and represses the protein synthesis. It is commonly used in the treatment of pneumonia, sinusitis, lyme disease, skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases [91]. Apart from antibacterial activity, Azithromycin has antiviral activity observed in bronchial epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus, where it increased the production of interferon-stimulated genes [92]. Additionally, its antiviral activity was reported against Zika virus in human glial cells, where it prevented the virus induced alterations in fetal brain [93]. Also, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was found to be effective in SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia, where this combination significantly decreased the virus load and involved in the elimination of virus [94]. Energetics based modeling suggests that this drug combination might show the effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complex. Recently Pfizer has reported the necessary data of azithromycin for SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials (NCT04321278) [95]. Another antibiotic and anti-tuberculosis drug Carrimycin being tested to treat the SARS-CoV-2 patients, currently, it is under clinical trials (NCT04286503), however, its safety and efficacy need to be established in COVID-19 patients.",

It is also found to be effective in treating single-stranded RNA viruses such as pneumovirus, Lassa fever virus, Junin virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and the CoVs [105,106]. Remdesivir exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity and showed beneficial results in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV induced respiratory infections. It has been recommended to administer to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in United States of America, Europe, and Japan, where physicians found the beneficial results [107]. But it is not yet approved by the drug regulators for treating the patients who are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Gilead has started the clinical trials for the potential treatment of COVID-19 [108]. Remdesivir is a prodrug and is metabolised to its active form GS-441524, which is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [109]. It interferes with the viral RNA polymerase activity and further inhibits the viral exoribonuclease involved in proofreading and ultimately causes the deprivation of viral RNA production [110]. Remdesivir was tested in clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, where it exhibited significant antiviral activity. Further, it was also tested in combination with Chloroquine and found to be effective against COVID-19 [79]. However, the data available is limited on Remdesivir and further studies need to be conducted to prove its essential role in treating COVID-19 along with its drug-drug interactions and contraindications.",

It is also found to be effective in SARS-CoV and also tested in SARS-CoV-2 in combination with corticosteroids [124,125]. Interferon alfacon-1 shows antiviral activity by binding to interferon receptors type 1 including IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. Further, it initiates the dimerization and activates the Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) phosphorylation. The signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2) bind to the phosphorylated IFNAR and initiate the expression of immunomodulators and antiviral protein expression including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase (2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS) [126].

Zhongyu Zhu et al. tested the human monoclonal antibody m396 for treating the SARS-CoV, which competes with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2 and inhibits the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE2 [133]. Chunyan Wang and coworkers tested human monoclonal antibody 47D11 on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains, where it binds with conserved epitope present on the spike RBD and further it cross-neutralized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and this mode of action is independent to receptor binding inhibition [134]. Anjeanette Roberts and colleagues developed monoclonal antibody MAb 201 and tested on the golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection, where it inhibited the viral replication and decreased the interstitial pneumonitis [135]. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible due to interaction of spike protein with human ACE2, thus spike protein is the main target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Various neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are tested against SARS-CoV including 80R, CR3014, CR3022, m396, B1, 201, 68, 1F8, and 5E9, these antibodies might play an important therapeutic role in SARS-CoV-2 infections [136].

The active constituent of turmeric, Curcumin exhibits wider pharmacological activities such as anti-bacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti-diabetic properties. Curcumin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 level and suppressed the cytokine storm in Ebola virus infected experimental models [141]. Additionally, Curcumin also inhibited the SARS-CoV replication and the effective concentration (EC50 value) was found to be around 10 \u03bcM and also acted as a protease inhibitor [142]. Thus it might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections, where intravenous (i.v.) route of administration in suitable formulation form may enhance the better bioavailability. Similarly, a thorough search across all the natural products needs to be evaluated for their direct antiviral effects and their potential role in controlling severe inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 induced pneumonia.",

Methanolic extract of neem leaves exhibited antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 infections by inhibiting HSV-1 glycoprotein mediated viral fusion and polykaryocytes [143]. Nimbolide is an active constituent of Neem tree explored as a pharmacological modulator in treating various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases [144]. TNF-\u03b1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in activation of various signaling cascade and this cytokine might be playing role in respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 mediated pneumonia. Nimbolide is found to be TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor and also suppresses the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-\u03baB and HDAC-3 and inhibited the cytokine storm observed in ARDS experimental model [145]. Thus it might show beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections by direct antiviral activity or indirect supportive therapy by controlling the inflammatory cytokine storm. This natural product may have clinical significance in inflammation associated with viral diseases. The other natural product Withaferin A is isolated from Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and widely used to treat various diseases such as cancer, fibrosis, and inflammatory disorders. It has shown the antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex virus 1 and 2 [146], which may show plausible effects against COVID-19.",

Apart from the antioxidant effects, Vitamin C involved in chemotaxis, phagocytosis and increases the reactive oxygen species to kill the microorganisms and also acts as an antibacterial agent. It also protects cells by clearing the non-functional organelles by apoptosis mechanisms. Also, it involved in proliferation and differentiation of B- and T-cells, which play a pivotal role in immune mediated reactions [155]. Recent scientific reports suggest that vitamin C inhibits the LPS induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression ad reduced the MDA levels and increased the GSH levels and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent [156]. Additionally, Vitamin C inhibits the lung fibrosis by reducing the IL-17 secretion and induced SOD levels [157]. Vitamin C also has a direct virucidal effect at higher concentrations and decreased the virus load of Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected cells [158,159]. In general, vitamin C is considered as strong immune booster and must able to protect wide array of microbial infections. However, some reports suggest that \u22651 g per day vitamin C supplementation had no significant effect on common cold incidence. But, some evidence infers that vitamin C could have moderate preventive effects in low dietary intake groups or acute physical stress suffering people [160]. Based on the anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, Vitamin C infusion was tried in SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia patients and numerous clinical trials (NCT04323514, NCT04264533, NCT03680274, and NCT04326725) are ongoing for its therapeutic usage.",

Vaccines are prepared from dead or inactivated microorganisms or purified products derived from the respective organisms. Vaccines are available as prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents. Apart from the traditional live attenuating method, Novavax is constructing the recombinant vaccine, where the antigens stably expressed from the spike protein in baculovirus system [160]. In this method, they are isolating the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is involved to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and this sequence is pasted into the genome of a bacterium or yeast, where it will produce the large quantity of protein of interest. The mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-COV-2 was developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the clinical trials. Here, the mRNA vaccine is injected to the people through intra muscular route, where the immunogens are produced in human cells instead of recombinant system and exhibit the higher immunocompatibility [162]. In this mRNA vaccine system, the uridines are modified into pseudouridines in order to prevent the immune-mediated reactions exerted by toll-like receptors such as TLR7 and TLR8, where they recognize the uridines and further activate the interferon response [163,164]. This vaccine strategy is currently under phase I clinical trials, where they are working on two objectives, the first objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity measured by ELISA to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57 [165]. However, it will take some more time to evaluate its full efficacy and safety potential before it is allowed for patient application by regulatory bodies. Similar type mRNA vaccine BNT162 was developed by BioNTech and Pfizer against COVID-19, which is under the clinical trials [166].",

This vaccine strategy has given significant results in preclinical studies, now they have received the approval to initiate clinical trials and Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing on [168].",

The tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is primarily used to prevent tuberculosis [170] and other diseases such as leprosy [171] and Buruli ulcers [172]. The recent epidemiological study suggests that universal BCG vaccination might play an important role in controlling the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The SARS-CoV-2 affected countries mortality is different in various countries; it may be due to temperature, elder population, humidity, cultural differences, migration, and health systems. New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) scientists proposed that the countries that do not opt the universal BCG vaccination were affected mainly by SARS-CoV-2 infections such as Italy, Netherlands, and USA etc. as compared to the counties who follow the universal BCG vaccination [173]. BCG vaccination offers broad-spectrum activity against the prevention of respiratory infections and it might reduce the SARS-CoV-2 oriented mortalities. Currently, Australia, Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) have started the clinical trials first on the front line health workers [174]. If it works effectively in SARS-CoV-2, it will be a game-changer in vaccine research in the current overwhelming situation.",

Meijuan Zheng et al. reported that CD8+ T-cells and NK cells were significantly decreased, while NKG2A expression was dramatically increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [178]. NK cells recognize the NKG2D, which is an activating receptor of NK cells involved in clearing the virus infected cells. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) exhibit an important role in modifying the NK cells and play an essential role in cell-based immunotherapy for treating cancer and viral diseases [179]. Actually, NK cells have shorter half-life and their activity was improved by IL-15 super agonist (sIL-15/IL-15R\u0251 chimeric protein) upto 20 times more and ultimately increases the target cytotoxicity [180]. In general Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) neutralizes the CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity [181]. Chongqing Public Health Medical Center has constructed and prepared the universal off-the-shelf IL-15 super agonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. This developed vaccine system inhibited expression of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and suppressed the NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2. Additionally, IL-15 super agonist enhances the NK cells activity and CRS is prevented by GM-CSF neutralizing scFv. Further, ACE2 CAR-NK cells inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection safely and effectively. These advanced targeted cell therapy strategies need to be evaluated under controlled clinical trials, which is already initiated currently (NCT04280224 and NCT04324996).Apart from the above mentioned pharmacological interventions, few more drugs are illustrated in Table 9\nabout their anti-SARS-CoV and anti-MERS-CoV activity.",

In particular, the human CoVs were found to cause mild respiratory diseases. In November 2002, SARS-CoV infection was emerged in Guangdong Province of China, identified to be fatal resulting in ARDS, which became a pandemic in 37 countries with over 8000 reported cases and 800 deaths [182]. This deadly SARS virus was found to be originated from horseshoe bats that transmitted to pangolins before reaching humans [183]. At that time no specific drugs or vaccines were available and only preventive measures were implemented to limit the transmission rate by maintaining social distance, quarantine, travel restrictions, patient isolation. In 2012, another zoonotic CoV were identified from Saudi Arabia postulated to have originated from the dromedary camels which infected 2494 people and 858 deaths were reported [184], In late December 2019, a recent global outbreak, a novel CoV strain has been evolved which is linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China with the symptoms varying from mild respiratory illness and pneumonia in most of the patients, to fatal consequences that progresses to ARDS by the induction of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.43 million cases of COVID-19 has been confirmed worldwide, and this pandemic is rapidly escalating all around the globe and most of the countries implemented the most restrictive mass quarantines that led to severe global socioeconomic disruption which has become the greatest concern of WHO [185]. As of now, there are no specific approved drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 and currently, physicians are using the repurposing drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Azithromycine, Dexamethasone, Acetaminophen etc., and they are showing plausible results, however more studies are required for specific use against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, immune boosters such as Vitamin C, Zinc and other natural products are suggested in preventing the viral infections. Additionally, scientists are developing the new antiviral drugs and vaccines, and few are under the clinical trials. Apart from traditional drug therapy, medical practitioners are transfusing the convalescent plasma to rescue the critically ill patients with successful outcome in viral load reduction; Also, MSCs were effective for treatment with encouraging improvement with fewer side effects. Thus there is a lot of scope to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; there is a need for vigorous effort on the vaccine development and exploration of potential antiviral treatment regimens. Simultaneously, the primary and intermediate host and mechanism of its cross-species spread and human interface needs to be investigated. Owing to the fact that new CoV viruses will continue to evolve on the basis of their ability to undergo frequent recombination's of their genomes, mutations, the propensity to infect multiple species and the increasing human-animal interface, the strict legislations should be made to prohibit the consumption and farming of terrestrial wild animals to prevent the future outbreaks.",
