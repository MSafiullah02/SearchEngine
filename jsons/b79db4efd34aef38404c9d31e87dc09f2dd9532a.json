Parasites and pathogens of wildlife can threaten biodiversity, infect humans and domestic animals, and cause significant economic losses, providing incentives to manage wildlife diseases. Recent insights from disease ecology have helped transform our understanding of infectious disease dynamics and yielded new strategies to better manage wildlife diseases. Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large-scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems. 2. To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer-reviewed WDM literature. 3. While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40 years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory. 4. Some theoretical concepts such as density-dependent transmission have been commonly applied, whereas emerging concepts such as pathogen evolutionary responses to management, biodiversity-disease relationships and within-host parasite interactions have not yet been fully integrated as management considerations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Theory-based disease management can meet the needs of both academics and managers by testing disease ecology theory and improving disease interventions. Theoretical concepts that have received limited attention to date in wildlife disease management could provide a basis for improving management and advancing disease ecology in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "population density decreased due to disease, contact rates would become too low for transmission to continue; thus, pathogens would be extirpated before host populations (Anderson & May 1979) . However, disease-induced declines and extinctions of wildlife resulting from small population sizes, reservoir hosts, host switching and heterogeneity in contact rates, susceptibility and transmission within and among populations have forced a re-evaluation of this perspective (de Castro & Bolker 2005) . For example, when contact rates among individuals do not depend on host density, pathogens are more likely to drive populations to extinction because transmission continues as host populations are reduced, as seen with Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii (Boitard 1841) facial tumour disease where transmission appears to be related to mating behaviours (McCallum 2012) .

Disease outbreaks are often caused by novel pathogens or the appearance of known pathogens in new hosts. Often, details of host-pathogen interactions are unknown. By combining limited information with general principles of disease ecology (Table 1) Theory is often refined by evaluating competing hypotheses. Therefore, adaptive management is one way to integrate theory and management, especially if multiple management hypotheses can be tested (Holling 1978) . Differentiation among competing hypotheses is synonymous with identifying optimal management in this framework. Thus, monitoring the effects of disease interventions on prevalence, virulence and host vital rates can help to estimate model parameters including transmission and recovery rates and help in evaluating management outcomes. When agencies have limited flexibility in decisionmaking, thus precluding adaptive management, the best available theoretical and system-specific knowledge can at least produce a 'best guess' management strategy (Gregory, Ohlson & Arvai 2006) . Failed management is still valuable in this framework because outcomes can be compared to predictions from competing models of disease dynamics that can be selectively eliminated, as with Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (McDonald-Madden et al. 2010 ). This approach produces mechanistic insights that might be missed if management strategies are characterized simply as effective or ineffective based on management outcomes. If many groups apply adaptive management separately in similar systems without communicating, generalities that benefit management and disease ecology may remain elusive. Systematic reviews, invaluable to biomedicine, can help establish which interventions are effective and explain heterogeneity in effectiveness with a standardized meta-analytic approach.

Misapplication of theory at an inappropriate scale, or in a system that does not meet necessary assumptions, could cause undesired consequences. For instance, an assumption of broad-scale culling as a disease management intervention is that pathogen transmissions scale positively with host population density. However, density-dependent changes in social behaviour can alter dispersal patterns that violate this assumption, increasing transmission, as seen with bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and European badgers Meles meles (Linnaeus 1758) (Woodroffe et al. 2006) . Work in the badger-TB system has refined our understanding of the effects of culling on social animals. However, one could argue that if culling-induced dispersal had been discovered in another disease system, the unintended increase in TB transmission to cattle following badger culling might have been avoided. Unfortunately, had this been the case, the applicability of the social perturbation-transmission increase phenomenon to the badger-TB system would have remained uncertain. This underscores the value of moving beyond a case studydominated paradigm, towards a rigorous and empirically verified contingency-based understanding of theory applicability to disease management.

Field interventions can test concepts of unknown generality in wildlife disease systems. This is particularly important for management because interventions such as culling are justified on the basis of host density thresholds for disease persistence, which depend on host life-history, seasonality and population dynamics(Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005;Altizer et al. 2006; Fig. 3).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "We thank Y.P.
