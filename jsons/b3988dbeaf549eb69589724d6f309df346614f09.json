Historically, cryopreservation of stem cell graft has been done only for a small fraction of allo-HCT due to concerns around negative impact of freezing and thawing on the viability of hematopoietic stem cells and function of donor lymphocytes (1) . Previous retrospective studies comparing allo-HCT outcomes of cryopreserved versus freshly infused peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft from matched donors have shown comparable survival outcomes but marginally delayed neutrophil and platelet engraftment with cryopreservation (1, 2) . Some of these studies have shown increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) at least with matched sibling donor but results were not consistent with matched unrelated donor grafts (2) (3) (4) . In absence of a prospective randomized study, the question of, 'Can a cryopreserved graft replace the freshly-infused graft in allo-HCT without compromising the outcomes?' The current study showed comparable survival outcomes between cryopreserved (n= 274) and",

There was some suggestion of decreased risk for chronic GvHD and lower disease-free survival among the recipients of cryopreserved graft. The study did not detect any difference in overall survival however, sample size might be a limiting factor. Previous studies have shown reduced viability, proliferation and cytokine release capacity of donor lymphocytes after cryopreserved. Impaired alloreactivity of graft T cell due to cryopreservation may be a reason for reduced chronic GvHD incidence but higher risk for disease relapse. Natural Killer (NK) cells (CD56+) appear to have low tolerance to freezing and thawing process compared to other mononuclear cells (8) . This becomes important given delayed NK-cell reconstitution/maturation seen with PTCy (9). It could be another potential explanation for increased risk of disease relapse with cryopreserved graft, but this needs to be studied systemically. Type of cryopreservation media also appears to impact T cell viability which needs to further validated if cryopreservation becomes routine practice in the future (10) . The authors have correctly pointed out several limitations of the analysis, most importantly the lack of information about the reason for cryopreservation in individual patients. Additionally, immune reconstitution, surrogate markers of cell viability before and after cryopreservation and the influence of cryopreservation strategies require further study (10) .",

Travel restrictions, donor availability, blood product shortage and strained health care system secondary to COVID-19 pandemic have forced us to re-evaluate the current model of allo-HCT. In face of these challenges, both the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)(11) and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (12) are strongly recommending cryopreservation of all unrelated donor grafts and some centers have moved to cryopreserve all related donor grafts. Thus, we welcome these data on cryopreserved grafts. There are several advantages of cryopreservation apart from logistical simplicity. Cryopreservation allows assurance that an adequate cell dose is available from an older or lower body mass related donor before conditioning regimen is started. It allows additional period of donor monitoring in case of exposure to a communicable disease such as COVID-19 before graft is infused. Cryopreservation may facilitate allocating a fraction of cells for storage for future donor lymphocyte infusion assuming pre-specified cell count thresholds are met (13) .",

The largest uncertainty pertains to whether the delayed cryopreservation after significant travel will be detrimental for unrelated donor grafts. Couriers chaperoning unrelated grafts may face unpredictable delays due to transportation challenges during COVID-19 as grafts are chaperoned by a courier. This study included few unrelated grafts 56 (20%) which were not separately analyzed. Each day of delay of cryopreservation reduced viability by 5% for umbilical cords (14) . In one study showing significant engraftment failures, all failures occurred in patients receiving unrelated donor PBSC (9/25) as opposed to 0 of 8 receiving related PBSC grafts (15) . Apart from risks of infusion reaction from dimethyl sulfoxide, potential loss of cell dose from washing, routine cryopreservation is costly and may put further strain on stem cell processing facilities. Invariably, a few cryopreserved grafts will not be infused due to recipient related issues, which leaves the donor exposed to unnecessary health risks.",

We thank authors for doing this timely study as the results are rapidly applicable in the current era of COVID-19.

In this issue, Hamdani et al. analyzed the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry to compare the outcomes of cryopreserved versus freshly infused stem cell graft(5). The study was limited to patients who received post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and majority of the patients received a PBSC graft from a haploidentical related donor. PTCy has emerged as universal GvHD prophylaxis platform across the donor types with outcomes comparable to standard calcineurin inhibitor-based prophylaxis(6). The use of PTCy is rapidly increasing across the globe due to favorable graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) free survival in haploidentical and matched donor settings combined with relatively low cost and ease of administration(7).",
