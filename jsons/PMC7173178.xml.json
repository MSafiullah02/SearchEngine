Although MPA 1 occurred to be the first antibiotic isolated in pure and crystalline form, further studies were not continued for a long time [5].",

In literature were reported amide MPA analogs bearing glycine [22], [23], [24] alanine [22] valine, glutamic acid, leucine and phenylalanine [3] moieties as potential anticancer and immunosupressive agents. In order to obtain an amide bond between the MPA molecule and the amino acid, a very large amount of condensing agents was checked, for example: 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) with pyridine, N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) with NMM O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) with N-methylomorpholine (NMM) or method of mixed anhydrides (isobutyl chloroformate). Unfortunately, none of the above methods occurred to be effective, since low conversion of substrates or difficulties with purification of target amides [3]. EDCI (1-ethyl-3-(3\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) was successfully used as a condensing reagent in the presence of DMAP without any racemization suppressant in the synthesis of optically active amino acid derivatives, where amino group of chiral amino acid is acylated [25], [26], [27]. This method proved to be suitable for the synthesis of most of compounds 11\u201317. Amino acid MPA derivatives 11\u201317 were obtained by means of a condensation reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) acting as a base in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Scheme 1\n).",

In case of compound 17 the inhibition of K. pneumoniae was comparable to the control effect of ampicillin (128 \u03bcg/ml). The MIC50 for this compound is at MIC50 of MPA. The MIC50 for compound 15 is lower than MIC50 of MPA. For the remaining bacteria there is no clear activity (at the concentration limit). Compounds 11, 12, 13, 15, 26, 31, 32 exhibited the greatest activity against S. aureus, but the MSSA strain was more sensitive than MRSA. In case of analog 21, for S. aureus MSSA, the inhibitory force (MIC50 = 8 \u03bcg/ml) is significant if compared to MPA (MIC50 \u00bb 187.5 \u03bcg/ml), which causes very poor growth inhibition. In case of K. pneumoniae for compounds 11, 12, 14 MIC50 is equal to 256 \u03bcg/ml (concentration limit) and is higher than for MPA (MIC50 = 128 \u03bcg/ml). These modifications do not affect the improvement of antibacterial activity for this bacterium. Conversely, compounds 15 and 26, 31, 32 indicated lower MIC, (MIC50 = 64, 16, 32, 32 \u03bcg/ml respectively) and show enhanced antimicrobial effects compared to MPA. By analyzing the results it can be concluded that MPA modifications such as 11, 12, 15, 26, 31, 32 are promising for S. aureus, while 15, 26, 31, 32 modifications are promising for K. pneumoniae. There was no bacteriostatic effect of the tested compounds on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The remaining compounds 18\u201323 caused very poor growth inhibition (<10% control) or no inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria. The bactericidal effect was not found for any MPA derivative. Compounds 17\u201323 exhibit poor activity against all groups of microorganisms, no susceptibility was observed.",
