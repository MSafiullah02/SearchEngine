Since the end of 2019, Chinese authorities have reported a cluster of human pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China (Wang et al., 2020), and the disease was designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These cases showed symptoms such as fever and dyspnea and were diagnosed as viral pneumonia (Tan et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). Whole-genome sequencing results showed that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus that was initially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Wu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially designated the virus SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020), although many virologists argue that HCoV-19 is more appropriate (Jiang et al., 2020). As of February 24, 2020, 79,331 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO globally, with 77,262 cases in China, including 2,595 deaths (https://www.who.int/). In addition, 29 other countries have confirmed imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (https://www.who.int/), raising great public health concerns worldwide.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of large and enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes (Lai et al., 2007, Lu and Liu, 2012). The viruses can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and deltaCoVs (Woo et al., 2009; https://talk.ictvonline.org/). Previously identified human CoVs that cause human disease include the alphaCoVs hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2015, Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009). Both alphaCoVs and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause self-limiting common cold-like illnesses (Chiu et al., 2005, Gorse et al., 2009, Jean et al., 2013, Jev\u0161nik et al., 2012). However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection can result in life-threatening disease and have pandemic potential. During 2002\u20132003, SARS-CoV initially emerged in China and swiftly spread to other parts of the world, causing more than 8,000 infections and approximately 800 related deaths worldwide (WHO, 2004). In 2012, MERS-CoV was first identified in the Middle East and then spread to other countries (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Zaki et al., 2012). As of November 2019, a total of 2,494 MERS cases with 858 related deaths have been recorded in 27 countries globally (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Notably, new cases of MERS-CoV infecting humans are still being reported (https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic pathogens originating from animals. Detailed investigations indicate that SARS-CoV is transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans (Azhar et al., 2014, Ge et al., 2013, Guan et al., 2003). The source of SARS-CoV-2, however, is still under investigation but linked to a wet animal market (Zhu et al., 2020, The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team and Li, 2020).",

            "text": "Virus infections initiate with binding of viral particles to host surface cellular receptors. Receptor recognition is therefore an important determinant of the cell and tissue tropism of a virus. In addition, the gain of function of a virus to bind to the receptor counterparts in other species is also a prerequisite for inter-species transmission (Lu et al., 2015). Interestingly, with the exception of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1, both of which have been shown to engage sugars for cell attachment (Li et al., 2005), the other human CoVs recognize proteinaceous peptidases as receptors. HCoV-229E binds to human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) (Li et al., 2019), and MERS-CoV interacts with human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4 or hCD26) (Lu et al., 2013, Raj et al., 2013). Although they belong to different genera, SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for virus entry (Hofmann et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2009). After the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese scientists promptly determined that SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes hACE2 for cell entry (Zhou et al., 2020).",

We subsequently solved a 2.5-\u00c5 crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD in complex with hACE2, which reveals a receptor-binding mode similar overall to that observed for the SARS-CoV RBD (SARS-RBD). However, SARS-CoV-2-CTD forms more atomic interactions with hACE2 than SARS-RBD, which correlates with data showing higher affinity for receptor binding. Notably, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as murine polyclonal antisera against SARS-S1/RBD were unable to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the previously developed SARS-RBD-based vaccine candidates are unlikely to be of any clinical benefit for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. Taken together, these data shed light on viral entry and pathogenesis and will hopefully inspire new targeted treatments for this emerging pathogen.",

These strong polar contacts include the SARS-CoV-2-CTD residue A475 interacting with hACE2 residue S19, N487 with Q24 (Figures 2C and S3\nA), E484 with K31, and Y453 with H34 (Figures 2D and S3B). Residue K417, located in helix \u03b13 of the CTD core subdomain, was shown to contribute ionic interactions with hACE2 D30 (Figures 2D and S3B). Notably, the bulged loops in SARS-CoV-2-CTD, the \u03b11\u2019/\u03b21\u2019 loop and \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2019 loop, properly position several residues (G446, Y449, G496, Q498, T500, and G502) in close proximity with hACE2 amino acids D38, Y41, Q42, K353, and D355, forming a concentration of H-bonds (Figures 2E and S3C). Further virus-receptor contacts include SARS-CoV-2-CTD Y489 and F486 packing against hACE2 residues F28, L79, M82, and Y83, forming a small patch of hydrophobic interactions at the interface (Figures 2C and S3A). Overall, the virus-receptor engagement is dominated by polar contacts mediated by the hydrophilic residues. In support of this hypothesis, a single K353A mutation was sufficient to abolish these interactions (Figure S2L).",

Consistent with this high degree of similarity, the soluble SARS-RBD blocks the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 ligand with hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures S2J and S2K). Further detailed comparison of the receptor binding interface between the two viruses reveals that, among the 24 residues in hACE2 that make vdw contacts with either CTD, 15 amino acids display more contacts with the SARS-CoV-2-CTD (Table 2). The SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding interface also has more residues than SARS-RBD (21 versus 17) that directly interact with hACE2, forming more vdw contacts (288 versus 213) as well as H-bonds (16 versus 11) (Tables 2 and S1). Consistently, SARS-CoV-2-CTD in complex with hACE2 buries larger surface areas than SARS-RBD (1773 \u00c52 versus 1686 \u00c52).",

To test this hypothesis, we performed real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. The mFc-tagged S-domain proteins were captured by anti-mouse IgG (mIgG) antibodies that were immobilized on the chip and tested for binding with gradient concentrations of the soluble ectodomain proteins of hACE2 and hCD26. As assay controls, SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD were found to readily interact with their respective canonical receptors (Figures 4A and 4D). SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD bound to hACE2 but not to hCD26 (Figures 4E, 4F, 4I, and 4J). The recorded binding profiles revealed typical slow-on/slow-off kinetics, as observed with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding to hACE2 were calculated to be 94.6 \u00b1 6.5 nM and 133.3 \u00b1 5.6 nM, respectively. These values represent ~4-fold higher binding affinities than that observed for the SARS-RBD engaging the same receptor, which was determined to be 408.7 \u00b1 11.1 nM (Figure 4). Taken together, the increased atomic interactions between the hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding region leads to ~4-fold higher binding affinity compared with the SARS-RBD.",

In light of the determinant role of SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD in receptor recognition (Li et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005, Lu et al., 2013, Raj et al., 2013), the majority of neutralizing antibodies have been shown to target the RBD, exerting neutralization activity by disrupting virus/receptor engagement (Du et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2016). We therefore further prepared murine polyclonal antibodies against SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD. These two viral RBDs share very limited sequence identity and exhibit distinct structural characteristics in the RBD external subdomain that mediates receptor binding (Li et al., 2005, Lu et al., 2013). In the positive control, anti-SARS-RBD antibodies, but not anti-MERS-RBD antibodies, potently bound to cells expressing SARS-CoV S, as expected (Figures 5C and 5D). Nonetheless, neither of the antibody preparations bound to SARS-CoV-2 S (Figures 5E and 5F). In agreement with this observation, although SARS-CoV-2-CTD is structurally similar to the SARS-RBD structures (Figure 3), the electrostatic surface potential maps of these proteins were different (Figure 5G and 5H), which might explain the differing immunogenicity of the two ligands. Therefore, the results highlight distinct epitope features between SARS-RBD and SARS-CoV-2-CTD, although both can engage hACE2.",

The complex structures of hCoV-NL63 CTD and SARS-RBD bound to hACE2 have been reported previously (Li et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2009). Although hCoV-NL63 CTD and SARS-RBD are structurally distinct, the two viral ligands recognize and engage sterically overlapping sites in the receptor (Li, 2015). The complex structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD together with hACE2 reveals that the majority of binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 also overlap the SARS-CoV binding site.

Our crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD/hACE2 is well superimposed with the cryo-EM structure, with an RMSD of 1.019 \u00c5 over 722 pairs of C\u03b1 atoms.

Further structure alignments show that the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-CTD in the complex also fits well with its counterparts in the cryo-EM structures, with RMSDs of 0.724 \u00c5 (exposed state) and 0.742 \u00c5 (buried states) related to PDB: 6VSB and 0.632 \u00c5 (exposed state) and 0.622 \u00c5 (buried state) related to PDB: 6VYB, respectively.

The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been reported to contribute to priming of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use was able to block entry.

However, the binding sites for the other three mAbs (B30A38, A50A1A1, and C31A12), which were generated using SARS-CoV S1 as the immunogen, remain elusive. Consistently, a recently published paper also reported similar results showing that three SARS-RBD-directed mAbs, S230, m396, and 80R, were unable to bind to SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020). Furthermore, we also demonstrate that polyclonal antisera directed against SARS-RBD do not recognize the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Delineating this cross-species transmission route could be highly instructive for disease control. Nevertheless, the natural host and the intermediate adaptive animal, if any, for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. The structural information for SARS-CoV-2-CTD and hACE2 shown in this study should shed light on the viral inter-species transmission route by characterizing the interactions between S and hACE2 of different species in the future.",
