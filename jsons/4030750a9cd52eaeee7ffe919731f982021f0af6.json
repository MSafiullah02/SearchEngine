Although it shows a high mortality rate in humans, currently there is no licensed therapeutic. During the recent epidemic in West Africa, it was demonstrated that administration of antimalarial medication containing amodiaquine significantly lowered mortality rate of patients infected with the virus. Here, in order to improve its antiviral activity, a series of amodiaquine derivatives were synthesized and tested for Ebola virus infection. We found that multiple compounds were more potent than amodiaquine. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the two independent parts, which are the alkyl chains extending from the aminomethyl group and a halogen bonded to the quinoline ring, were keys for enhancing antiviral potency without increasing toxicity. When these modifications were combined, the antiviral efficacy could be further improved with the selectivity indexes being over 10-times higher than amodiaquine. Mechanistic evaluation demonstrated that the potent derivatives blocked host cell entry of Ebola virus, like the parental amodiaquine.

Similar to the parental drugs in these cases, Table 3 The chemical structures of the 2nd series of amodiaquine derivatives and antiviral activities against EBOV-GFP. Y. Sakurai et al. Antiviral Research 160 (2018) 175-182 amodiaquine has a history as a medication in clinic and also showed a small but significant clinical benefit to patients infected with EBOV (Gignoux et al., 2016) . Therefore, derivatization of amodiaquine appeared to be a reasonable process in order to discover promising therapeutics against Ebola virus disease. Our results demonstrated that this approach has a potential to work for this disease indication. Our SAR analyses demonstrated that the alkyl chain extending from the aminomethyl group was one of the key modification target for increasing the anti-EBOV activity. Such modifications were reported to assists in drug accumulation in vacuolar compartments (Parhizgar and Tahghighi, 2017) , suggesting that efficient and appropriate localization of the amodiaquine derivatives in infected cells is an important factor for its anti-EBOV activity. Indeed, amodiaquine and chloroquine in mammalian cells accumulate much less than in malaria parasites (Hawley et al., 1996) , a desirable property as an anti-malarial but not useful for an antiviral. Consequently, the antiviral potency of these 4aminoquinolines is much less than its reported anti-malarial activity, with an IC 50 in the ten nanomolar range (O'Neill et al., 2003; Hocart et al., 2011) . However, our study showed that extension of the alkyl chains of amodiaquine could improve the anti-EBOV potency by 7-fold, suggesting that the modification appeared to improve the efficacy of compound accumulation in host mammalian cells. In addition, the alkyl chain of amodiaquine is important for in vivo drug kinetics because it is a target of metabolism by CYP2C8, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, and potentially affects the circulation half-lives of the compounds and their kinetics inside the cells (Backman et al., 2016) . Although this metabolism may not be critical for amodiaquine because the major metabolite, desethyl-amodiaquine, still has a similar anti-EBOV activity, metabolic forms of our derivatives and their antiviral potency are unknown and will need to be investigated. Moreover, as amodiaquine induces rare but serious liver injury, which was suggested to be caused by P450-mediated drug metabolism, these modifications may also affect toxicity of the derivatives in vivo and will need verification (Shimizu et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 443, "text": "(Balint, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 671, "end": 692, "text": "(Parker et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 693, "end": 712, "text": "Olson et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 713, "end": 735, "text": "McMullan et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1090, "text": "Sakurai et al.

Halogen substitution or insertion has been a commonly used technique for drug development (Hernandes et al., 2010) . Such modification generally affects the interaction between the compound and the target by mechanisms such as steric effects and the formation of halogen bonds, which strength is proportional to electronegativity of the halogen. Interestingly, our SAR analysis revealed that the electronegativity of the halogens inversely corresponded to anti-EBOV potency, suggesting that the effect of the halogen substitutions seemed to depend on steric effects, in which larger halogens could efficiently occupy the space in the target. Although the inhibitory mechanism of Fig. 2 . Amodiaquine and its derivatives inhibit glycoprotein-dependent entry of EBOV. To address the effects of compounds on virus entry into the cell, pseudotyped viruses bearing the glycoprotein of (A) EBOV or (B) VSV and encoding a firefly luciferase reporter were used. Huh7 cells were treated with the indicated doses of each compound and challenged with either pseudotyped virus.

Each data set is representative of two independent experiments. amodiaquine is unclear, our data suggest that the anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine appears to have a molecular target, which is important for EBOV infection, or accumulates in a cell compartment required for EBOV to access. Moreover, our mechanistic assay indicated that the molecular target or the compartment, if any, is specific to EBOV entry step as VSV entry was comparatively resistant to the compound treatment.
