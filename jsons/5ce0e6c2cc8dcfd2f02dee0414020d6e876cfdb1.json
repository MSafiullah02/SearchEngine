The World Health Organization attributed the super spreading phenomenon to the lack of stringent infection control measures in hospitals during the early days of the epidemic (2) , but this does not explain some of the SSEs identified so far, for example, the Amoy Gardens outbreak (3, 4) . At least two separate SSEs have been identified in the Hong Kong epidemic (3, 5) , and five have been identified in the Singapore epidemic (6) .

The effective reproduction number, R t , is defined as the number of infections caused by each new case occurring at time t. Epidemic decay results when the effective reproduction number is maintained below one (7). Riley et al. (8) and Lipsitch et al. (9) concluded that a single infectious case of SARS would infect 2.7 or three secondary cases without any control measures, based on the Hong Kong and Singapore data, respectively. The SSE phenomena were also reported for other diseases, such as measles (10) , rubella, laryngeal tuberculosis, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever (11) .

This was done using the information on daily admission or daily onset of symptoms, the distribution of the incubation period, and the distribution of the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission. We used mathematical and statistical models to build on the relations among the various parameters. Analyzing the daily number of infected cases would allow us to capture the occurrence of SSEs in an epidemic. In an SSE, the number of infected cases would exceed the expected numbers derived from the number of infectious individuals in the community and the infection rate. We estimated the number of infected cases due to the SSEs by subtracting the expected number of infected cases if no SSE occurred from the estimated total number of infected cases. We further explored the relations between the daily number of symptomatic cases and the daily number of infected cases and tried to identify the group(s) of symptomatic individuals who were most likely to be infectious.

The daily admission distribution, q j , was the probability of admission on the jth day after becoming symptomatic. The most reliable data on the reported daily probability of incubation, p j , and the daily probability of admission, q j , were probably those from Donnelly et al.

It was expected that errors would be introduced when applying these data to other regions or countries, in particular the distribution of waiting time from symptom onset to hospital admission, which might be affected significantly by local conditions. Fortunately, both equation 2 and the daily probability of admission were not used for analyzing the Singapore data, as the daily distribution of individuals with onset of symptoms was available (6) .

Plotting the daily number of newly infected cases allowed us to identify peaks or aggregates of infections that would suggest SSEs. The good agreement between our predicted infection peaks and the reported occurrence of all seven SSEs in Hong Kong and Singapore suggested some underlying but not yet fully understood mechanisms of disease transmission. The possibility of predicting the likely exposure time also helps in environmental studies to identify the environmental conditions at the time of infection. We predicted several additional SSEs that had not been identified and reported. It might be worthwhile to document and investigate these unidentified SSEs retrospectively by reviewing relevant medical records and epidemiologic investigation reports. It is not known whether the larger number of infected cases per SSE in Hong Kong when compared with Singapore (table 1) was due to differences in the effectiveness of or variations in the choice of disease control measures or due to other factors, such as a higher population density in Hong Kong and other environmental factors. Interestingly, the average infection rate per day of general spreaders for the entire epidemic period in Hong Kong was also significantly greater than that in Singapore (0.23 compared with 0.14). According to our estimations, SSEs played a very important role in the SARS epidemic, being responsible for nearly three fourths of the infections in Hong Kong and Singapore. This has important public health implications. If our model is valid, the control of SARS epidemics would be directly governed by the ability to prevent/control the SSEs. One super spreader or SSE could ignite a whole new outbreak if the mechanisms of an SSE or effective control strategies are not identified.",

Our results strongly suggest that the daily number of new infections did not depend on the total number of symptomatic cases, as only a very small proportion of the symptomatic individuals were infectious. We do not know exactly what makes a super spreader different from other infected individ-uals, but our results suggested that late admission to a hospital (more than 4 days) after symptom onset could be partly responsible for the occurrence of SSEs, especially during the early phase of the epidemic, since patients admitted late would have developed a high viral load. This agrees with the results of a study of SSEs in Beijing, where the efficiency of SARS transmission increases at a later stage of the illness (24). Peiris et al. (25) found that the viral load increased after the onset of symptoms and peaked at around day 10. The World Health Organization's consensus document on the SARS epidemiology (23) noted that, in the data from Singapore, few secondary cases occurred when symptomatic cases were isolated within 5 days of illness onset.

The super spreading phenomena of Ebola were suspected to be due to a larger number of \"contacts\" of the super spreaders or some inherent differences in the virus-host relations, such as, perhaps, a more virulent virus strain or higher levels of viral shedding (11) . The great variability in the numbers of infected cases among the seven identified super spreaders in SARS epidemics in Singapore and Hong Kong suggested that some epidemiologic and environmental factors could have contributed to the infection. For the outbreak at Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, it has been suggested that the environmental control systems (drainage system and aerosol flows) were responsible for amplifying the virus sources and for transmitting the virus to a large number of people (3). In the case of the Prince of Wales Hospital, the use of a nebulized bronchodilator was believed to be an important factor that increased the droplet loading surrounding the index patient (5) . However, new studies suggest the possible roles of airborne virus-laden aerosols and the ventilation system design (26) . These two examples suggest the possible roles of the environment in amplifying viral sources in SSEs and further support our hypothesis that an SSE is also determined by environmental factors. Hence, proper environmental and ventilation design would be very important in controlling future SSE-based SARS coronavirus transmissions.",

After the strict isolation measures were imple-mented in Hong Kong and Singapore, the reported date of admission would be equivalent to the date of isolation, although some limited hospital-acquired infection might still occur. In Hong Kong, the community infection constituted a much higher proportion of the total number of cases than in Singapore. The impact of the infectivity period assumption on the analyses for Hong Kong might be smaller than the impact on those for Singapore. The simple mathematical model for determining the occurrence of SSEs can be used to determine the key parameters of SSEs during any potential future SARS epidemics. In practice, such a simple model needs to be combined with studies on transmission dynamics, which provide essential data on the infection rate of the general spreaders. The accuracy of the prediction of SSE occurrence depends on the accuracy of the input data, that is, the distribution of the daily number of individuals admitted to hospitals (or becoming symptomatic), the daily probability of symptom onset after being infected, and the daily probability of being admitted to hospitals after developing symptoms. This means that various hypotheses derived from our analyses remain to be confirmed by further epidemiologic and clinical studies.",

The second peak (March 20-21) corresponded to the outbreak of SARS in the Amoy Gardens (figure 3, part A). The third peak coincided with the peak in hospital admission of cases in Hong Kong (figure 2, part A). There appeared to be synchronized occurrences of infection peaks in both the general community and among health-care workers in Hong Kong (visible only in the derived time series of infections and not in the observed series of admissions), and there were certain days with no predicted infected cases. Another 3-4 smaller aggregates of cases were discerned following the three major peaks. For Amoy Gardens, a single peak stood out around March 20 (figure 3, part A), with another aggregate of infected cases around April 4.
