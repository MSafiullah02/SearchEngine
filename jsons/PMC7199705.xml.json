On 3/10/20, the hospital recommended all non-essential outpatient visits, including oncology, be stopped or done via telemedicine. Over approximately 2.5 weeks, they started to reallocate patient space to make room for COVID-19 patients and maximize available staff. In oncology, this was accomplished by sending inpatient oncology patients to other hospitals in the health system with less COVID-19 patient volume and converting outpatient space into inpatient space. Distribution of patients throughout the health system was done through hospital administration and patient referral patterns, but the largest numbers were seen at the XXXXXXXXXXX Hospital, a tertiary center where there was the highest capacity for intensive care unit beds. By 4/2/20, inpatient oncology patients were being put into outpatient infusion rooms in our cancer center that were equipped with oxygen, vacuum and fluids to accommodate inpatients. Elective outpatient surgeries were stopped on 3/10/20, and all non-emergent operations, including oncologic surgery, were stopped on 3/20/20.",

Five radiation therapists (12%) were quarantined during that period: 1 for travelling to a level 2 high risk country as defined by CDC, 2 for exposures to infected or high risk individuals, 1 home with symptoms, and 1 tested positive. No therapists were shfited to work elsewhere in the hospital. No therapists went on disability or FMLA. Two physics staff members (1%) were quarantined without testing. In the administrative staff, a total of 10 were out of work due to quarantine or illness (21%). The attending staff was fully present on site until 3/17/20 when a decision was made to move to attendings working exclusively remotely with at least one doctor on site serving as \u201cdoc of the day\u201d. Consults and follow ups were hereby done via Telemedicine. Non-urgent follow-up appointments were deferred. On Treatment Visits (OTVs) were done via Telemedicine or in person, depending on the clinical need and physician preference. If a patient needed to be seen by a physician, it was staffed by the \u201cdoc of the day\u201d or on site-resident. By 4/1/20, 90% of OTVs were done via Telemedicine. One attending physician (5%) contracted the virus (community acquired) on 3/17/20 and was quarantined for 13 days, but the physician had minimal symptoms and continued to work full-time remotely.

On 3/27/20, the ACGME released a Guidance Statement allowing for a temporary release of program requirements allowing residents to be moved to services outside of their designated program to deal with the pandemic. Strict rules were set forth regulating how the redistribution could be done. Knowing that residents from radiation oncology would likely be temporarily transferred into COVID related clinical environments like internal medicine or emergency medicine, residents were allowed to privately express to the program director any reason that he or she could not be deployed such as pre-existing medical conditions or living situations where they could not expose those at home to potential COVID infection. By 3/29/20, 7 of 11 residents (64%) were deployed throughout the health system, 6 in non-radiation oncology capacities. Re-distribution was done by request from other departments after a list of available residents was provided to them. During this month, one resident (9%) self-quarantined with symptoms for 7 days, and the rest remained on active duty.

The census was reduced by delaying treatments when possible, changing to a more hypofractionated radiation schedule, or completing treatment as scheduled. Active redistribution started on 3/25/20 (Table 1\n). Decisions were made by individual clinicians with oversight of the chairman. Patients were also transferred from high volume COVID-19 centers to less COVID intense areas to allow for more rapid decrease in patient numbers at high COVID-19 sites. The census, broken down by disease site, is shown in Figure 3\n. There was a median reduction of 30% for all disease sites except for breast and gynecology which had slight increases in patients.

The changes were a result of emerging data on the virus and fears of shortages as the surge developed. Initially, patients were not required to wear masks in the department or during treatment. Staff wore surgical masks and gloves from 3/1/20 onward for suspected patients and after 3/16/20 for all patients. Once the directive was received that staff were required to wear masks for clinical patient care, we encouraged all patients to wear masks. We were not able to provide masks for all patients (unless symptomatic) but the majority of patients were able to acquire masks on the outside. In late March, the hospital advised providing masks to patients and hence all patients were masked during their time in the department and whilst undergoing treatment. On 4/1/20, the hospital recommended N95 use for all patient encounters, including patients not suspected of COVID-19. Gowns were only used for known COVID-19 positive patients.

Additionally, as patients continue to need radiation treatment, it may create an excessive number of patients down the road which the system may struggle to handle in the face of a decreased workforce.

The directives from the hospital would change daily, sometimes hourly, and controlling the message in the department was critical to calming fears and avoiding rumors from developing. In particular, reassuring staff regarding the availability of adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to perform their job was extremely important and a major factor in alleviating anxiety for the staff. We specifically requested department leaders not send out mass e-mails without approval from the Chair to avoid inadvertent conflicting information and communication overload. Also, letting the staff know that it is true we are scaling back, and might even close certain parts of our service temporarily, helped to provide full disclosure to deal with tough situation. For instance, the residency program director tried to meet with the residents via phone or teleconferencing several times a week to share any new information. When the highly anticipated redeployment came, everyone was better prepared to deal with it. There is talk of attending physicians being deployed, as well as nursing and administrative staff in the weeks ahead, and being open about it makes the discussion easier.",

The degree of separation between providers in the department and someone who has COVID-19, and then dies from COVID-19, rapidly closes. Everyone is on edge and concerned about their patients and the well-being of their loved ones. Knowing that the department is all working for one clear goal, to care for our fellow citizens, whether they have COVID-19, cancer, or neither, has held the department together and gives us purpose to continue this fight unto the next month. We hope that our experience will help other departments across the country prepare for their own fights.",
