The announcement was met with both relief and consternation in the academic medicine community, as medical students, educators, and residency program directors weighed the implications of significantly altering the scoring on a key assessment of students\u2019 basic science knowledge.2\u20134",

When FSMB and NBME made the announcement to change Step 1 scoring to pass/fail, they created a unilateral change to the USMLE, at least for the short term. That change resulted in student anxiety about Step 1 shifting to bigger questions: What will program directors use instead of Step 1 scores? How will students distinguish themselves if they are interested in a competitive specialty, if they are from a newer or less well-known medical school, or if they are a graduate of a non-U.S. medical school?",
