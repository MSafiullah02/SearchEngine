            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by the eponymous coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), is an emerging zoonotic disease that was first isolated in 2012 from a human case in Saudi Arabia (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012). Subsequent investigations pointed to dromedary camels as the putative source of human infections (Azhar et al., 2014; Al Hammadi et al., 2015; Farag et al., 2015). The early implication of livestock (and dromedary camels in particular, Haagmans et al., 2014) in MERS\u2010CoV transmission rapidly led to a number of experimental and field studies that aimed to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of this virus in animal hosts (Adney et al., 2014; Alagaili et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2015; Reusken et al., 2013). These studies have led to the consensus that dromedary camels are the natural reservoir. They have furthermore provided some insight about the host and geographical range of the virus and have suggested some epidemiological characteristics, including the clinical picture and age distribution in dromedary camels (Wernery, Lau, & Woo, 2017). The evidence base that builds from these experimental and field studies provides the foundation for more complex epidemiological analyses, including statistical and mathematical modelling, risk assessments and meta\u2010analyses. Rigorous, detailed epidemiological data based on pragmatic research questions are crucial to these analyses and ultimately for sound policy and health interventions.",

            "text": "In the 6 years since the discovery of MERS\u2010CoV, several reviews have been published that have described key advances in understanding the virus in animal populations, and identified research gaps, such as the zoonotic modes of transmission (Arabi et al., 2017; Mackay & Arden, 2015; Mohd, et al., 2016). However, no formal mapping of the literature has yet been attempted. Scoping reviews provide the means to summarize and communicate findings, evaluate the existing body of literature and identify research gaps in a way that is replicable and minimizes bias (Levac, Colquhoun, & O'Brien, 2010). High\u2010impact emerging diseases, upon which there is typically a high degree of research activity in a short amount of time, could benefit from early and iterative synthesis research. Formal scoping reviews and/or systematic reviews can provide improved clarity for targeting research needs and therefore improve the effective and efficient use of limited resources. A scoping review of the MERS\u2010CoV animal literature will generate a detailed map of epidemiological and experimental knowledge, assess the suitability of the evidence for systematic review and chart outcomes for informing disease transmission models.",

Conference proceedings, and government and university websites in the Middle East were hand searched for citations on 11 September 2017. Two citations were added from searching conference proceedings. Although government and university websites in the Middle East were searched for reports and academic theses, no records were found. This could be due to language differences, as many of the websites were in Arabic and the search was conducted using online translation utilities. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) publishes reports of notifiable and reportable diseases that have been submitted by national governments. MERS\u2010CoV reports were accessed through the Food and Agriculture Organization's disease event database, EMPRES\u2010i, on 11 September 2017 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2014)).",

Other types of study designs included case reports, outbreak investigations and field sampling for diagnostic test validation or phylogenetic analysis. Experimental studies consisted of challenge and vaccine experiments. Two of the seven challenge experiments included a component that examined transmission to susceptible hosts.

            "text": "The aim of this scoping review was to identify and characterize the literature that explored MERS\u2010CoV in animal hosts. Field studies have provided compelling evidence that dromedary camels act as the reservoir host for MERS\u2010CoV. Experimental evidence has confirmed the susceptibility of dromedary camels and provided key details regarding the course of infection in camelids (Table 3). A challenge and transmission study conducted on goats suggests they may act as dead\u2010end hosts; however, this has not been demonstrated in the field. One experimental study provided evidence that pigs may also act as a host for MERS\u2010CoV (Table 3); however, the production range of domestic pigs does not overlap with camelids and is unlikely to be a risk factor where the disease is currently endemic. Bats present a unique challenge in determining their role in the ecology of MERS\u2010CoV. Although a study of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) demonstrates the potential of this species as a host, field sampling of bats has found a single fragment of MERS\u2010CoV RNA from a faecal sample of an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforates; Table 3). The immunology of bats presents a unique challenge in drawing conclusions regarding their role as a MERS\u2010CoV host (Brook & Dobson, 2015). While all known zoonotic transmission events have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula (World Health Organization, 2018), dromedary camels are raised across Africa and South Asia, and it is evident that the virus is also circulating in dromedary camels across their production range in these regions (Figure 2). While no autochtonous human cases of MERS\u2010CoV have been reported from African countries, the endemnicity of the virus in dromedary camel populations presents on the one hand a public health risk, and on the other, an opportunity for better understanding reservoir dynamics. African countries are underrepresented in the published body of literature, with only one\u2010fifth of the observational studies in this review conducted there. Likewise, only one study was published from the South Asia region (Saqib et al., 2017), which has a large dromedary camel population. Camel raising varies between the Middle East and other regions, and further epidemiological research coupled with anthropological and value chain studies that reflect these differences would potentially enhance our understanding of the risks for zoonotic spillover and how they differ across the regions.",

Study results suggested heterogeneity around these values, especially with respect to the prevalence of infection, with point prevalence estimates ranging from zero to almost 90%. Nine studies provided variability estimates (e.g., confidence intervals) around at least one prevalence value, indicating additional post hoc calculations would be required to assess the precision of prevalence estimates. Two studies presented results of multivariable models, which can help explain apparent variability in prevalence by identifying risk factors for infection and other determinants of virus activity. Dromedary sampling strategy within studies was often not reported (n = 30), reported as census sampling of a single group (e.g., case study, outbreak investigation) (n = 30), or convenience (n = 4), rather than random (n = 2), indicating that the majority of studies were not designed to be generalizable to a target population. An understanding of how MERS\u2010CoV fluctuates within and between host populations cannot be extracted from these data. It is recommended that future research uses existing evidence on MERS\u2010CoV in animal populations to inform sample size calculations, sampling strategies and research questions in order to improve on the strength of the evidence and address more sophisticated study objectives.",

The dynamics of immunity (e.g., duration of immunity) inform intervention strategies such as vaccination, as well as research questions such as the structure of disease transmission models. Longitudinal studies have been used to infer that natural infection in dromedaries confers either waning or partial immunity to MERS\u2010CoV (Ali, Shehata, et al., 2017; Hemida et al., 2017; Hemida, Perera, et al., 2014). One experimental study demonstrated partial immunity following natural infection in alpacas (Adney, Bielefeldt\u2010Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016). Longitudinal field studies may be capturing second infections or persistently infected camels with intermittent shedding. Examples of both exist among coronaviruses (Dowell & Ho, 2004; Isaacs, Flowers, Clarke, Valman, & MacNaughton, 1983), and the duration of natural immunity, and if or how reinfection differs from first infection are important characteristics to know. Molecular epidemiologic analyses, longer\u2010term field studies or experimental studies may help to answer these questions.",
