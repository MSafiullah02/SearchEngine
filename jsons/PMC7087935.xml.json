As of February 17th, 2020, 70,636 confirmed cases and 1772 death cases have been documented in China. 2019-nCoV also targets the respiratory tract and shares many similar clinical symptoms with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [3]. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, and dry cough, followed always by anorexia, myalgia, dyspnea, and so on [4\u20138]. Lymphopenia and prolonged prothrombin time are also the most common characteristics [4\u20136].",

            "text": "In addition, as cardiologists, we are also concerned about whether patients with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk for 2019-nCoV, and whether new coronavirus infections have an impact on the cardiovascular system. Previous studies have shown a relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and SARS and MERS [9\u201311]. A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV cases showed that diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in about 50% of the patients and cardiac diseases are present in 30% of the cases [11]. Diabetes was seen as an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS [9]. With the spread of 2019-nCoV and increase of the cases, more and more 2019-nCoV infected individuals exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardia-cerebrovascular disease. In Chen\u2019s study of 99 cases, 40% patients had cardia-cerebrovascular disease [6], and in Huang\u2019s study of 41 cases, 20% patients had diabetes [4]. These cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities might render them more susceptible to poor prognosis. Given the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV, an updated meta-analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by integrating the published studies is urgently warranted. Accordingly, the present analysis will not only identify the cardiovascular epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection with greater precision but also unravel the impact of the infection on the cardiac injury.",

We used the I2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity: 25%, 50%, and 75% represented low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively.

Thus, it is necessary for us to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and metabolic diseases in COVID-19. The present systematic analysis summarized the data from all of the five studies of COVID-19. The results demonstrated that the overall proportion of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were, respectively, 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%. According to Summary of the 2018 report on cardiovascular diseases in China, the morbidities of the hypertension and diabetes were, respectively, 23.2% and 10.9%, and there were about 13 million of cerebrovascular disease patients and 11 million of cardiovascular patients [21]. Therefore, comparing the data to the report, we did not find that people with hypertension and diabetes were more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population, even slightly lower. However, comparing the general population, the incidence of cardia-cerebrovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 is obviously much higher.",

So the relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and COVID-19-induced death cannot be determined. But what is assuredly is that patients with hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases or diabetes are more likely to develop severe/ICU cases after 2019-nCoV infection. The overall proportion of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. Although the difference of diseases in the meta-analysis is not statistical, the RR value is about 2.21, and we consider this might because of the sample size of included studies and the algorithm adopts the random effect model which is a more conservative approach.

In Chen\u2019s report, the first death was a 61-year old man with no previous chronic underlying disease. After he was admitted by ICU, he had developed severe respiratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis, and then experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead [6]. This case reminded us that patients with a novel coronavirus might develop acute cardiac injury. And further analysis indicates us that the incidence of myocardial injury is much higher in ICU/severe patients, about 13 folds more than non-ICU/cardiac patients. And furthermore, the observation also reminded us that patients with COVID-19 associated with unstable angina or STEMI have poor cardiac reserve, lower tolerance to severe pneumonia, and are more likely to develop cardiac insufficiency, leading to deterioration. According to the information released by Shanghai health commission, the first COVID-19 death in Shanghai was a patient 88 years old, with a serious history of hypertension, cardiac dysfunction. The analysis of death causes suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction, and in the course of its onset, the 2019 nCoV infection is only the inducement.",

According to Oudit\u2019s study, SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% of autopsied human heart samples from SARS-CoV infected patients during the Toronto SARS outbreak [22]. And they also confirmed that pulmonary infection with the human SARS-CoV in mice led to an ACE2-dependent myocardial infection [22]. ACE2 is an important target for SARS-CoV [23], and molecular modelling has shown high structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV [24]. ACE2 expression is highly tissue-specific, mainly expressed in the cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal systems, with a small amount expressed in lung cells. Therefore, in addition to coronaviruses causing pneumonia through ACE2 receptors in lung epithelial cells, we also need to pay attention to possible viral effects on myocardial tissue. Second, hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury. In Huang\u2019s study, 32% COVID-19 patients had various degree of hypoxaemia and need required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support. In Chen\u2019s study, up to 76% of patients require oxygen therapy. Due to severe 2019-nCoV infection, the pneumonia may cause significant gas exchange obstruction, leading to hypoxaemia, which significantly reduces the energy supply by cell metabolism, and increases anaerobic fermentation, causing intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals to destroy the phospholipid layer of cell membrane. Meanwhile, hypoxia-induced influx of calcium ions also leads to injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Third, Huang\u2019s study noted that high concentration of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10 and MCP-1 could be detected in patients infected with 2019-nCoV, which might lead to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses [4]. Furthermore, they also found that ICU patients had much higher concentrations of inflammatory factors than those non-ICU patients, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [4]. In addition, repeated floods of catecholamines due to anxiety and the side effects of medication can also lead to myocardial damage.",
