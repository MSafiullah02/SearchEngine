COVID-19 was initially understood as pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Now, after the reporting of a great number of mild and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 (the so-called iceberg phenomenon that is common for most infectious diseases) and the institution of RT-PCR as a diagnostic standard, radiological examination seems less important as a diagnostic tool than it used to be. Pneumonia is often considered a leading life-threatening risk for children.2 Radiological evidence is crucial in assessing organ damage, as indicated by the presence of pneumonia when COVID-19 progresses from mild or asymptomatic to severe. This potential for rapid disease progression justifies the definition of the moderate clinical type, which is mainly defined by the presence of mild pneumonia.",

Bilateral pneumonia was often associated with a higher white blood cell count, suggesting mixed infections. Right-lobe pneumonia persisted after 1 month of follow-up, but left-lobe pneumonia did not. Although only a small proportion of paediatric patients progress to severe illness or become critically ill, and COVID-19 pneumonia seems milder than H1N1 pneumonia,3 the outcome is often serious once patients with COVID-19 enter a severe condition. Among the three patients in our follow-up cohort who had severe disease, one patient died and one became critically ill.",

Additionally, from the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of chest CT scans appears to be higher than that of RT-PCR.4 Digital radiology might be a suitable choice to reduce the amount of radiation exposure to children. We agree that radiological examinations might not be necessary when looking after a large number of patients, where radiological examinations are not available, or when patients can be diagnosed with mild COVID-19 by an experienced clinician. Nevertheless, using CT scans to diagnose pneumonia helps to define moderate disease severity, provides valuable information about outcome, and increases the accuracy and sensitivity of screening.",

Furthermore, a more clinically based diagnosis of pneumonia requires experienced clinicians, and the wheezing, abnormal breath sounds, and snoring in Buonsenso's definition might result from mixed infections or be present intermittently.",
