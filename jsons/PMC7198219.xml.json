In computer vision, image descriptors describe elementary characteristics such as shape, color, texture or motion of images, which are visual features of images [1,2].",

Some descriptors such as HOG, LBP, SURF and SIFT have been proposed, so far [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. These descriptors are usually used in Machine Learning for pattern recognition and feature extraction [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. Each of these descriptors has disadvantages, like large dimension of feature vector and considering only certain features such as texture. To overcome these problems, an efficient image descriptor is presented in this research. This descriptor is created using combination of HOG, LBP and improved AlexNet CNN. Furthermore, for dimension reduction the PCA has been applied. When the proposed descriptor is used for image classification and CBIR, it provides benefits which are divided into following items: \u2022Higher accuracy and mAP compare with other works;\u2022Overcoming the problem of high dimension descriptors such as HOG;\u2022Sensitivity to intra-class as well as inter-class variety;\u2022High performance on imbalanced databases.\n",

For instance [20], has suggested a method that image features are extracted using the HOG and SURF descriptors, then the features of each descriptor are sent to convolutional layers, and the feature vectors with 1 \u00d7 2016 and 1 \u00d7 1024 dimensions are created. After that, these features are combined and their dimension is reduced by Fully Connected (FC) layers and eventually are used for classification.

Combining the LBP with HOG descriptor, improves the performance of detection considerably on some datasets [15,23].3)The HOG descriptor is computed on a dense grid of uniformly spaced cells and for improving the accuracy, uses overlapping local contrast normalization. The advantages of this descriptor is that it executes on local cells which is invariant to geometric and photometric transformation, except for object orientation [4,24].4)The improved AlexNet CNN detects the important and high level features automatically without any human supervision [21].\n",

Thus, extending the proposed method on CAD system can be a target for future researches.
