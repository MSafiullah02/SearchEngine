Each transducer consists of a sinusoidal wire embedded in an elastic self-adherent material ( Fig. 14.1 ). This allows the transducers to be applied to any chest or abdominal shape and size. One band is usually placed at nipple level ( R ch ) and the other approximately 1 cm above the umbilicus ( R ab ). These wires are connected to an electronic oscillator that generates a sine wave of 20 mV at 300 kHz. Stretch and relaxation of the bands produce variations in the electrical self-inductance within the wire and, thus, frequency (Adams 1996 ) . The RIP unit demodulates the frequency change to produce an analogue voltage waveform representing the changes in rib cage and abdominal volume in real time (Ohms Law). The inductance within the wires increases linearly as a function of cross-sectional area in curvedshaped objects (Watson et al. 1988 ; Martinot-Lagarde et al. 1988 ; Brazelton et al. 1999a ). The output of RIP is reliable within the frequency range of both conventional and high-frequency ventilator rates (Brazelton et al. 1999a , b ; Boynton et al. 1989 ) .

QDC allows derivation of the proportionality constant, k , in Eq. 14.2 . The relative contribution of each compartment to the overall voltage change is estimated by selecting a series of breaths of similar tidal volume. This is achieved by excluding all breaths greater than one standard deviation (SD) of the mean \u0394 R ch and \u0394 R ab value. The constant k is then estimated as SD( R ch )/SD( R ab ) (Sackner et al. 1989 ) . QDC has been shown to generate acceptable agreement with pneumotachograph measurement of tidal volume in term newborn infants (Adams 1996 ) and piglet models of surfactant-defi cient lung disease (Markhorst et al. 2006 ) . The reliability of RIP calibration is best when measurements are immediately pre-ceded by calibration and tend to deteriorate with time. RIP calibration accuracy decreases with severity of lung disease. In vitro, the phase deviation in the transducer outputs, and thus the stability of the proportionality factor, increases in a linear fashion at frequencies above 10 Hz (Boynton et al. 1989 ) . The accuracy of this process is also directly related to the number of breaths analysed (Brown et al. 1998 ) .",

In these circumstances, changes in relative volume can be expressed as a ratio to the tidal volume during the QDC period. This is useful during non-invasive ventilation (Courtney et al. 2001 ) and high-frequency ventilation (Markhorst et al. 2006 ; Habib et al. 2002 ; Weber et al. 2000 ; Markhorst and van Genderingen 2004 ; Copnell et al. 2009 ; Hoellering et al. 2008 ; Tingay et al. 2006 Tingay et al. , 2007a . After QDC, a modern RIP device has been found to have a mean relative measurement bias of \u22122.0 (SD 9 %) during short periods of high-frequency ventilation (HFV) in a piglet model of paediatric lung disease (Markhorst et al. 2006 ; Markhorst and van Genderingen 2004 ) . This error is less than common commercially available pneumotachographs (Scalfaro et al. 2001 ; Roske et al. 1998 ). This study also demonstrated that a k factor of 1.0 was reasonable for most paediatric lung disease states, overcoming some of the diffi culties associated with QDC during high-rate, low tidal volume ventilation.",

Identifi cation of lung overdistension during sequential increases in P aw was possible in the healthy and surfactant-depleted piglet lung using RIP-derived static compliance (Weber et al. 2000 ) . In both lung models, the relationship between applied P aw and compliance fi tted a second-order sigmoidal model of the pressurevolume relationship (Venegas et al. 1998 ) , with the P aw resulting in overdistension translating to the upper infl ection point of the sigmoid curve, suggesting that RIP could be used to describe the infl ation limb of the pressure-volume relationship (Weber et al. 2000 ) .

Mapping the volumetric response to recruitment is diffi cult at the bedside, and clinicians are limited to resorting to indirect indicators of lung volume, such as oxygenation. In a piglet model of paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (Brazelton et al. 2001 ) and term and preterm lambs (Gothberg et al. 2001 ) , RIP has been used to demonstrate lung volume recruitment, hysteresis and subsequent optimal P aw on the defl ation limb of the pressure-volume relationship of the lung. In both these studies, critical points within the pressure-volume relationship, including total lung capacity, were identifi able. RIP can also demonstrate improvement in the hysteresis of the lung after administration of exogenous surfactant (Gothberg et al. 2001 ) .",

For the fi rst time, lung recruitment, hysteresis and the closing pressure of the lung could be identifi ed during HFV in infants. In addition, a direct relationship between oxygenation and lung volume was confi rmed. This study demonstrated that uncalibrated RIP could be reliably used over prolonged periods (up to 3 h) to track \u0394EELV. Subsequently, the authors were able to demonstrate that RIP could determine the time when stable EELV had been achieved after a pressure change (Tingay et al. 2005 ).",

Despite the increasingly popularity of non-invasive modes of ventilation to treat neonatal and paediatric lung disease, a strategy to defi ne optimal continuous distending pressure (CDP) remains elusive. Interestingly, the use of RIP to measure EELV during CPAP is limited to two studies in preterm infants (Courtney et al. 2001 ; Elgellab et al. 2001 ) . In both studies, RIP was able to track the relationship between PEEP and EELV during a series of PEEP changes from 0 to 8 cm H 2 O. One study measured relative \u0394EELV using the RIPdetermined V T value as a unit of volume (Elgellab et al. 2001 ) . The other calibrated the RIP signal to the pneumotachograph V T during a brief period of spontaneous breathing through a face mask (Courtney et al. 2001 ), a technique that has been validated previously (Brooks et al. 1997 ). Both calibration techniques would be clinically reproducible. The results of both these studies suggest that RIP may be useful in determining the optimal CDP during CPAP (Fig. 14.6 ).",

Since then, RIP has been used extensively to assess tidal volume, thoraco-abdominal asynchrony and work of breathing in infants (Str\u00f6mberg et al. 1993 ; Courtney et al. 2001 ; Habib et al. 2002 ; Dolfi n et al. 1982 ; Tabachnik et al. 1981 ; Stefano et al. 1986 ; Adams and Zabaleta 1993a , b , 1994 ) . These initial studies demonstrated the accuracy of RIP in measurement of V T , in calibrated and uncalibrated modes, even over long periods of time (Brooks et al. 1997 ) . The accuracy of RIP compared favourably with impedance sensors and strain gauges (Adams and Zabaleta 1993b ) . Apart from a direct measure of tidal volume, RIP allows the potential to assess the respiratory effort and pattern over time. As RIP is a measure of chest wall and abdominal movement, detection of apnoea is possible (Brooks et al. 1997 ; Weese-Mayer et al. 2000 ) . During spontaneous breathing, knowledge of the synchrony of the abdominal and thoracic compartments is important as the summated signal constitutes the measured tidal volume. If the two compartments are out of phase (paradoxical breathing), there is the potential for the summated time course signal to indicate no tidal ventilation ( Fig. 14.7 ) . Such states of signifi cant asynchrony of thoracoabdominal motion signify poor lung mechanics and lead to signifi cant diaphragmatic work and fatigue (Musante et al. 2001 ; Schulze et al. 2001 ; Guslits et al. 1987 ).",

RIP has been used to identify improved tidal volume, thoraco-abdominal synchrony and chest wall displacement after transition to proportional assist ventilation from CPAP (Musante et al. 2001 ) . RIP has been shown to be a reliable alternative to pneumotachography in driving ventilator synchronisation during conventional mechanical ventilation in animal models of the normal and diseased paediatric lung . The accuracy of the RIP bands was depended on a reliable calibration of the contribution of each band to the summated signal. This accuracy diminished signifi cantly after body movement, limiting the use of the summated signal for prolonged mechanical ventilation periods in ICU. Schulze et al. have proposed that the use of the abdominal band alone would overcome these diffi culties and offer the advantage of being a leak-and dead-space-free method of determining spontaneous respiratory effort ).",

During these situations, RIP is likely to be a better indicator of tidal volume change in the thorax. Assessment of V T during HFV is problematic. Pneumotachographic measures at the airway opening provide an accurate trend of HFV V T in vitro (Scalfaro et al. 2001 ), but do not correspond with the volumetric changes measurable at the chest wall. The accuracy of pneumotachography during HFV in humans has not been confi rmed (Zimova-Herknerova and Plavka 2006 ); thus, it should be considered at best a proxy for tidal changes more distally in the tracheobronchial tree. In contrast, RIP is a direct measure of chest wall movement during HFV and likely to be a better representative of tidal volume. In an animal model of paediatric acute lung injury, RIP tidal amplitudes could be accurately measured and altered accordingly with changing PEEP and compliance (Markhorst et al. 2005 (Markhorst et al. , 2006 . RIP tidal amplitude could then be used to identify overdistension during HFV. A similar relationship between volume state of the lung and RIPderived V T has been found in human infants receiving HFV (Fig. 14.5 ) (Tingay 2013 ) . In this study, the RIP-derived V T response approximated that of V T measured by pneumotachograph (Tingay 2008 ).",

Compared to pneumotachography, RIP shows good agreement as a measure of V T during CPAP and spontaneous ventilation in preterm infants (Bar-Yishay et al. 2003 ; Brown et al. 1998 ). Unlike face mask pneumotachography, RIP offers the ability to monitor tidal ventilation without signifi cant disruption and can determine the synchrony of ventilation using the phase angle between the chest and abdominal tidal signals, sometimes expressed as a laboured breathing index (LBI). RIP has been used to demonstrate the effect of alterations in continuous distending pressure on tidal breathing patterns in preterm infants receiving CPAP. A higher pressure (maximum 8 cm H 2 O) resulted in a better V T and thoraco-abdominal synchrony and lower LBI, suggesting less work of breathing (Elgellab et al. 2001 ). Courtney and co-workers also demonstrated an association between increased respiratory rate and greater phase angle with CPAP delivered via nasal cannulae compared with short binasal prongs (Courtney et al. 2001 ). These small studies suggest that RIP may be useful as a monitoring device during CPAP.",

Furthermore, change in inductance measured by RIP is linearly related to total thoracic volume rather than gas volume per se. We have noted that RIP detects blood volume change within the chest during intravenous administration of fl uid boluses (Authors unpublished data). Early RIP systems were also susceptible to signifi cant thermal drift, limiting the capacity to accurately monitor \u0394EELV (Bhatia et al. 2010 ) . Some modern RIP devices require up to 60 mins to achieve signal stability in a stable ambient temperature (Tingay 2008 ; Bhatia et al. 2010 ), but thereafter, signal stability is excellent and, in many cases, better than pneumotachographs (Markhorst et al. 2006 ; Brazelton et al. 2001 ; Tingay 2008 ). Drift appears to be less of an issue in newer RIP systems (Bhatia et al. 2010 ) . The disease state of the lung may also affect the drift of the RIP signal.

Valuable insights have been gained both from experimental studies in animal models of lung disease and from ventilated humans, most of whom have been adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . In view of the radiation hazard, CT imaging specifi cally for delineation of patterns of aeration has not been performed in any systematic way in ventilated neonates, infants or children, but much of the data obtained in adult humans has direct relevance to even the smallest ventilated subject. The key observations made using CT imaging of the diseased lung are sum-marised in Table 14 .1 and discussed further below. A seminal observation from axial CT imaging in ARDS was that, in the face of relatively diffuse opacifi cation on plain X-ray, lung densities are inhomogeneously distributed on axial CT slices (Fig. 14.9 ) (Gattinoni et al. 1986 . It is now clear that ARDS is a patchy disease which includes areas of opacifi cation and consolidation interspersed with regions in which relatively normal lung architecture and aeration remain. It is presumed that ARDS in infancy and childhood, as well as a number of neonatal lung diseases (including meconium aspiration syndrome), are similar morphologically. This has implications for the type of ventilation strategy to be used and its potential effectiveness, particularly if there are large areas of consolidation resistant to reinfl ation that are in juxtaposition with areas of relatively unaffected lung prone to hyperinfl ation.",

The densities have been classed as diffuse, lobar or patchy (Puybasset et al. 2000 ) , with the diffuse pattern being associated with a greater response to recruitment (Constantin et al. 2010 ) . The pattern of lung densities has also been recognised to differ based on whether the lung disease is pulmonary or non-pulmonary in origin (Pelosi et al. 2003 ) . In the latter case, the major impairment of compliance involves the chest wall, including the diaphragm, which may be subjected to signifi cant limitation of movement in cases of abdominal sepsis or trauma (Pelosi et al. 2003 ) . Not surprisingly, supra-diaphragmatic lung regions are most prone to atelectasis when there is diaphragmatic splinting of this type. Examples in childhood are a preterm infant with necrotising enterocolitis or a child with acute pancreatitis, but again no systematic CT imaging studies have been performed.",

CT imaging has shown that dependent atelectasis occurs in the normal lung under anaesthesia (Brismar et al. 1985 ) and can be identifi ed in the full-term newborn with panalveolar disease (Fig. 14.11 ). Lung regions affected by dependent atelectasis are potentially recruitable with ventilatory manoeuvres, and this form of atelectasis can be counteracted by the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (Gattinoni et al. 1993 ) . For overcoming the effects of superimposed pressure in the most dependent regions, theoretical considerations would suggest that a PEEP level (in cm H 2 O) equivalent to the anteroposterior diameter of the chest (in cm) is required. This estimate assumes a highly diseased lung with a gas to tissue ratio close to zero (Hickling 2001 ) .",

This is chiefl y because of concerns regarding radiation exposure (Mayo et al. 2003 ) , although, with the advent of low-dose thin-section CT, the radiation dose may be 5-10 % of that with conventional CT imaging. Other limitations are lack of availability of CT scanning time and the diffi culties and risks of transfer of ventilated neonatal and paediatric subjects to the CT scanning suite. For these reasons, it is unlikely that CT imaging will become widely used as a tool for evaluating regional lung infl ation in this group. As discussed elsewhere in this text, there is potential for electrical impedance tomography to give similar information at the bedside of a ventilated subject, and experience with this form of imaging is growing (Frerichs et al. 2001a ).",

Given the relative lack of fat and other hydrogen-bound complexes in the lung, there is a direct relationship between proton density and lung water content. Studies in experimental animals (Schmidt et al. 1986 ; Viard et al. 2008 ) , as well as human adults (Mayo et al. 1995 ) and preterm infants (Adams et al. 2002 ) , have confi rmed that MR imaging can quantify the water content of the lung and indicate its distribution. A measurable increase in water content has been demonstrated in animals with experimental pulmonary oedema (Schmidt et al. 1986 ). Gravityrelated maldistribution of lung water, with higher water content in the dependent regions, has been observed on MR imaging (Adams et al. 2002 ) . Clearance of lung liquid after birth has been measured in preterm lambs using the technique (Viard et al. 2008 ) . A single report from a neonatal unit with an onsite MR imaging suite has provided information on the lung water content and distribution in the term and preterm newborn (Adams et al. 2002 ) . The lungs of preterm infants showed considerably greater water content than their term counterparts and a more obvious sternovertebral gradient in water distribution (Fig. 14.15 ). Rapid redistribution of the density gradient occurred after turning prone, and lung water appeared to be more uniform in prone position than when supine (Adams et al. 2002 ) .",

Supra-diaphragmatic axial CT images in a 5 kg piglet with lung injury after repeated saline lavage. Areas of non-aerated lung (+100 to \u2212100 HU) are traced in blue, and areas of hyperinfl ation (\u2212900 to \u22121,000 HU) in red. At a PEEP of 6 cm H 2 O, 53 % of the voxels are non-aerated, and only 0.15 % are hyperinfl ated. After a tidal infl ation to a PIP of 28 cm H 2 O, very little non-aerated lung remains (2 %), but there is demonstrably more hyperinfl ation (2.5 % of all voxels). Ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cm H 2 O results in considerable improvement in end-expiratory collapse (22 % nonaerated), with minimal effect on hyperinfl ation (0.43 %) scanning is used quite extensively for diagnostic imaging of suspected pulmonary malignancy. In the research laboratory, PET techniques have been applied in experimental animals for the estimation of regional lung perfusion and water content (Schuster and Howard 1994 ; Richard et al. 2002 ) and for the evaluation of pulmonary infl ammation and ventilator-induced lung injury (Kirpalani et al. 1997 ; Monkman et al. 2004 ; Costa et al. 2010 ) . These latter studies used 18 fl uorodeoxyglucose, a tracer that is taken up into neutrophils and thus preferentially localises in areas of infl ammation, including in the lung parenchyma. In newborn piglets, a clear increase in tracer uptake by the lung has been noted after injurious ventilation compared to controls with normal lungs (Kirpalani et al. 1997 ) . Increased tracer uptake was seen in ventilated sheep with endotoxaemia to be localised to regions that were both aerated and perfused (Costa et al. 2010 ) , suggesting that factors beyond gas distribution alone contribute to regional neutrophilic infl ammation during lung injury with associated endotoxaemia.",

The non-invasive and radiation-free method of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has recently been proposed as a possible future monitoring tool in this indication. EIT allows the assessment of regional lung ventilation and of changes in regional lung volumes based on the measurement of electrical properties of the lung tissue. EIT has no known hazards and can be applied at the bedside. However, EIT has not been used routinely in a clinical setting, thus, its usefulness still has to be proved. Several small clinical studies in neonatal and paediatric patients indicate the potential of EIT monitoring. To establish the method as a routine medical examination tool, further development of the EIT hardware and software is necessary. Defi nition of the most adequate EIT examination procedures providing measures suitable for clinical decision-making and optimising the ventilator therapy is the other prerequisite.",

These currents have an amplitude of only a few mA and a frequency in the range of approximately 10 kHz-1 MHz. The currents are applied between adjacent pairs of electrodes in most of the EIT systems. The current-carrying electrode pairs are cyclically activated, and the current injection rotates around the body. During each application of electrical current, the resulting potential differences are measured between all other passive electrode pairs. The voltage distribution developed on the surface of the chest is determined by the internal distribution of electrical resistances within the chest and its shape. Also in the case of voltage measurement, adjacent electrodes are preferentially used. With the described 16-electrode arrangement and pattern of rotating current application and voltage measurement, a total of 208 voltage values are acquired during each scan cycle. The maximum EIT scan rate is rather high. With up to 50-60 scans/s, it is much higher than in other, classical radiological tomographic methods, like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The resulting potential differences are measured at all passive electrode pairs during each current application. The process of current applications and acquisitions of potential differences rotates around the chest at high rates",

The calculated impedance values are then converted to a two-dimensional, cross-sectional EIT scan in an either grey or colour scale. This process of generation of impedance distribution images from the measured potential differences and known excitation currents is called image reconstruction (Barber 1990 ; Morucci and Marsili 1996 ) . The generation of EIT scans is not easy. This is fi rst of all related to the fact that the human body is a three-dimensional object. Electrical currents applied through the electrodes at the boundary of the chest are not confi ned to the two-dimensional transverse plane, defi ned by the electrode array. The currents also fl ow into more distant regions, and their pathways are not known. This means that EIT scans always refl ect not only the impedance distribution in the studied plane but are also affected by tissues lying outside of the measurement plane, although with lower sensitivity. Another point is that the currents tend to penetrate less into the deeper chest regions. Therefore, the spatial resolution also tends to be poorer in the centre than at the chest periphery.",

The fi rst approach aims at depicting the distribution of absolute values of electrical impedance within the chest. Although such images have already been obtained in vivo, their quality was rather poor. This is mainly because these images are very sensitive to EIT data collection errors and require the knowledge of the shape of the body. The same limitations also apply to the second approach, which tries to differentiate the tissues based on their varying response to electrical currents of different frequencies. The most frequently used approach is the third one, in which changes or differences in electrical impedance are determined and converted to EIT scans. The advantages of this approach are that errors tend to cancel and the uncertainties about the body shape do not affect the image quality. The calculated impedance changes are often normalised by relating them to a reference state of impedance. This is, for instance, done when the so-called weighted backprojection (Barber 1990 ) is used, which has been the most often used method of EIT image reconstruction in in vivo EIT imaging so far. All EIT scans shown in the fi gures in this chapter have been generated using this type of image reconstruction.",

Figure 14 .17 illustrates this capability of EIT by showing the regional tracings of EIT data in three image pixels. These tracings reveal the typical ventilationrelated variation of the EIT signal as well as the Regional EIT data Fig. 14.17 Chest EIT scans and regional EIT tracings. During an EIT examination, a series of EIT scans is acquired showing the instantaneous distribution of electrical impedance changes in the chest cross-section relative to a reference state ( top left ). In this example, the reference impedance distribution corresponded to the average impedance distribution during a 20-s long phase of mechanical ventilation. Thus, the EIT scans show higher regional impedance values at higher regional lung volumes ( light tones ), lower values at lower volumes ( dark tones ) or minimum changes when the regional lung volumes were close to the reference volumes. The tracing of global EIT data ( bottom left ) was generated by summing up all 912 image pixel values of relative impedance change (rel.\u0394 Z ) in each scan of the acquired series and plotting them as a function of time. An increase in impedance values occurs during inspiration, a fall in impedance is observed during expiration. The light grey circles and the dotted arrows indicate at which moment of the respiratory cycle; the four EIT scans were obtained. The tracings of regional EIT data ( right ) originate from three image pixels shown as small squares in the EIT scans. The top tracing is a plot of a time series of local relative impedance change obtained in pixel 1 which was located in an anterior region of the chest. Thus, the signal contains impedance changes related to ventilation superimposed on which are the more frequent changes synchronous with the heart rate. The middle tracing originates from the pixel 2 located at the edge of the left lung region showing predominantly the ventilation-related impedance changes.",

The infant suffered from posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus and was studied in the operating room prior to surgery during continuous positive pressure ventilation with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cm H 2 O. The respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min, the inspiration/expiration ratio was 1/1 and the fraction of inspired O 2 23 %) heart beat synchronous variation detectable especially in the heart region. The excellent time resolution of EIT with high scan rates allows even more frequent events to be tracked, like the very small and rapid air volume oscillations during high-frequency oscillation ventilation. Thus, the regional pixel tracings of EIT data contain valuable compressed information on different aspects of the lung function which can be addressed and evaluated using various functional evaluation approaches. Functional EIT imaging allows the generation of the so-called functional EIT scans from the series of individual EIT scans which provide condensed and separate information on one selected aspect of the lung function, e.g. the spatial distribution of lung volume changes or tidal volumes, as will be described in the next text section. A series of individual EIT scans containing hundreds or even thousands of scans may serve as a basis for generation of several types of functional EIT scans. For instance, the functional EIT scan in Fig. 14. 18 was generated from the 20-s series of 500 EIT scans shown in Fig. 14.17 and characterises the ventilation distribution in the chest cross section during this EIT examination.",

The changes in aeration may be spatially inhomogeneous, and it is the advantage of EIT that it can track these aeration changes on a regional level. For instance, an increase in regional electrical impedance in the dependent lung regions after an increase in PEEP may indicate alveolar recruitment. Merely a small increase in impedance in the nondependent regions with a pronounced effect in other regions may hint at possible local overdistension. Figure 14 .19 illustrates the potential of EIT in tracking regional lung volumes in another exam- Rel.\u0394Z The examination was performed in a 10-week-old preterm infant with a body weight of 2,500 g and a length of 44 cm. The data was acquired in a neonatal intensive care unit during postoperative weaning from mechanical ventilation after orchiopexy. The infant was ventilated in an assisted mode with synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation ( SIMV ). The respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, the inspiration/expiration ratio was 1/5.2, positive end-expiratory pressure 3 cm H 2 O, peak inspiratory pressure 24 cm H 2 O and the fraction of inspired O 2 21 %. During the initial phase of the examination, highlighted by the fi rst light grey area, the EIT signal refl ects the typical lung volume changes occurring in the lungs during SIMV: the four large defl ections represent the larger ventilator-induced breaths, the smaller defl ections in between originate from the smaller spontaneous tidal breaths. During the subsequent short apnoea, the impedance values fall to a new end-expiratory level due to loss in lung volume, followed by threecontrolled ventilator-induced breaths during continuous positive pressure ventilation ( CPPV ), highlighted by the second light grey area . The small and rapid impedance signal fl uctuations, discernible especially during the apnoeic and CPPV phases, are synchronous with the heart rate of 152 beats/min. The three images at the top of the fi gure are functional EIT scans showing the distribution of tidal volumes: the left two of these scans were generated from the SIMV phase and provide the distribution of both ventilator-induced and spontaneous breaths, and the right image shows the tidal volume distribution during CPPV. Of note is the more pronounced ventilation of anterior lung regions during fully controlled ventilation without spontaneous breathing activity. The fi ve functional scans on the right show the changes in regional lung volume at different phases of the EIT examination compared with the lowest volume at end-expiration during CPPV ple. This EIT examination was performed in a ventilated infant during weaning and shows the loss in lung volume after temporary cessation of spontaneous breathing activity during assisted ventilation. The lowest level of lung aeration was noted at end-expiration after the spontaneous breathing had ceased. Functional EIT scans can be generated which visualise the instantaneous level of aeration at different time points of the examination.",

The differences between the regional peak and trough values of the EIT signal are representative of regional tidal volumes. If these regional differences between the maximum and minimum impedance values are calculated from one or more respiratory cycles in each image pixel, they may be converted in another type of a functional EIT scan showing the distribution of tidal volume in the chest cross-section. The distribution of tidal volume is infl uenced by the type of ventilation (spontaneous vs. mechanical), body position and gravity and by the local mechanical properties of the lung tissue which may be nonhomogeneously altered by lung pathology. Figure 14 .19 shows how the tidal volume distribution may vary even within a very short time interval. In the course of this EIT examination, which was already referred to in the above text, the studied infant was ventilated in an assisted mode of ventilation. Ventilation was accomplished by ventilator-induced breaths in combination with spontaneous breathing activity. The functional EIT scans of tidal volume distribution generated from this phase of the EIT examination show that the regional tidal volumes were smaller during the spontaneous than ventilator-induced breaths; nevertheless, their spatial distribution was similar. An interesting phenomenon is revealed when the distribution of the ventilator-induced tidal volumes is compared between this phase and the phase when the infant ceased to breathe spontaneously. A more pro-nounced distribution of the tidal volume to the nondependent anterior regions was found in the latter phase indicating that a spatial redistribution of tidal volume had occurred when the mechanical breaths were applied at a lower end-expiratory lung volume.",

            "text": "It was explained in the above text that functional EIT scans of various types can be generated from the same EIT examination by application of various evaluation steps and procedures. Figure 14 .19 provided an example in which functional EIT scans showing the tidal volume distribution and regional lung volume changes relative to the lowest end-expiratory volume were obtained from the same EIT data by different analysis. The interpretation of multiple functional EIT scans may offer a deeper insight into the regional lung function. Even more detailed understanding could be obtained if functional EIT information is extracted from examinations performed during predefi ned manoeuvres, for instance, during a PEEP trial (Frerichs et al. 2003a ; Meier et al. 2008 ) . The high scan rates achievable during EIT examinations allow an assessment of rapid dynamic phenomena in the regional lung function. Therefore, not only the above-mentioned regional lung volume changes and tidal volumes can be measured but also the dynamics of regional lung fi lling and emptying described (Frerichs et al. 2001b ) . For instance, progressive fi lling of lung regions characterised by an increasing rate of impedance change may occur during tidal lung recruitment or degressive fi lling with a decreasing rate of impedance change may arise from overinfl ation (Hinz et al. 2007 ). A regional time delay in an increase in impedance during lung infl ation (Wrigge et al. 2008 ) may be a sign of airway collapse with delayed opening of the affected lung units. Regional tracings of the EIT signal registered after a stepwise change in airway pressure may be used to calculate the distribution of regional time constants.",

This way of presentation is suitable if rapid information on the spatial distribution of a chosen relevant lung function measure is needed. (2) Alternatively, the relevant EIT lung function measure can be calculated in meaningful pulmonary regions of interest (Pulletz et al. 2008 ; Victorino et al. 2004 ; Zhao et al. 2009 ) and used in its numeric form, for instance, to follow regional changes in lung function over time.

Until 2009, less than 20 EIT studies have been conducted in this patient group, mostly in rather small numbers of patients. The number of experimental and clinical studies in adults is much higher. Many of these studies possess a high degree of relevance for EIT application in the neonatal/paediatric fi eld. EIT studies in neonates and infants have mostly been motivated by two goals. The fi rst one was to utilise the full non-invasiveness and lack of radiation of this new examination method to study such phenomena in the lung function which were previously not accessible to other established medical modalities or not ethically justifi ed. EIT enabled regional analysis of lung function in preterm infants or neonates. Even lung healthy babies could be examined by EIT during undisturbed spontaneous breathing. Since very little is known about the regional lung function in patients of this age group, EIT was able to provide valuable information on the ventilation distribution under a variety of conditions. For instance, the signifi cant effects of body and head position and the infl uence of the respiratory pattern (e.g. respiratory rate, sighs) on the spatial distribution of ventilation were established (Frerichs et al. 2003b ; Heinrich et al. 2006 ) . Furthermore, the differences in regional ventilation between preterm and term neonates could be addressed (Riedel et al. 2009 ). The specifi c features of the neonatal ventilation distribution pattern have been studied and compared with adults (Dunlop et al. 2006 ; Schibler et al. 2009 ; Smallwood et al. 1999 ) . A few studies have been performed in neonates with the aim of determining the effect of maturational changes on the lung electrical properties, showing that increased alveolisation is associated with higher electrical impedance of the lung tissue (Brown et al. 2002a , b ) .",

EIT was applied to determine the effects of changed ventilator settings or therapeutic procedures (surfactant administration, suctioning) on regional lung function. These studies were performed in neonatal and paediatric intensive care units and provided the fi rst evidence that useful feedback information can be generated by EIT at the bedside. The studied infant patients were followed by EIT during spontaneous breathing and different modes of mechanical ventilation (e.g. non-invasive and invasive ventilation in fully controlled conventional and high-frequency oscillation modes or assisted ventilation). It has been demonstrated that the immediate effects of changing PEEP, peak inspiratory pressure, inspiration-to-expiration time ratio and fraction of inspired O 2 on the spatial distribution of ventilation were discernible (Frerichs et al. 2001a ). Long-term monitoring of several days duration was also successfully accomplished to study regional lung ventilation in a critically ill neonate before and after cardiac surgery (Frerichs et al. 1999b ). It has also been shown that rapid, regionally heterogeneous derecruitment induced by suctioning can be detected by EIT in children suffering from ARDS (Wolf et al. 2007 ). Finally, regional end-expiratory lung volumes were determined by EIT in ventilated infants with respiratory failure due to a respiratory syncytial virus infection (Kneyber et al. 2009 ).",

To obtain this kind of information, no radiation exposure is necessary; there exist no known hazards. After the application of EIT electrodes on the chest, continuous EIT scanning can easily be performed and interrupted any time.",

Although continuous technological development and use of more advanced image reconstruction procedures can be expected to improve the EIT image quality, image resolutions as known in conventional chest radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging will never be possible (Seagar et al. 1987 ). However, it has to be pointed out that EIT is not intended to be recommended as a sole imaging method. A meaningful combination of patient examinations using conventional imaging modalities, providing excellent anatomical information, and EIT, providing functional information, should be aspired. The conventional methods will make intermittent information on lung morphology available; EIT will offer continuous monitoring of lung function.",

Many of the intriguing data obtained by this method in ventilated neonates and infants were merely small observational studies, in part, simple case reports. This means that EIT must be applied in larger groups of patients with clearly defi ned goals and outcome measures. One of the most important objectives should be the defi nition of appropriate procedures for standardised EIT examination of patients. Such procedures should provide relevant EIT measures suitable for clinical decisionmaking and optimisation of ventilator therapy. Since EIT has the perspective of becoming a broadly used monitoring tool at the bedside, it will be operated by the medical personnel and not only by a few specialists, as is the case today. Therefore, factors like practicability of application and user friendliness of EIT data acquisition and evaluation will also play an important role in the clinical implementation of this technology.",

This perspective is based on (1) the clinical need for improved patient monitoring, (2) several positive characteristics of this technology which are superior to other existing imaging modalities and (3) promising fi ndings of hitherto existing EIT studies. The present interest in EIT is mainly driven by the increasing knowledge of possible detrimental effects of mechanical ventilation. If EIT monitoring succeeds to be established in a clinical setting, then it may provide online feedback on regional lung function and its changes in response to modifi ed ventilator settings and other therapeutic procedures. This may facilitate individually optimised mechanical ventilation and minimise the incidence of ventilator-induced lung injury.",
