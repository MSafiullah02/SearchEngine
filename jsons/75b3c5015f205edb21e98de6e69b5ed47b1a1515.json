All symptoms and medical histories were self-reported and limited by patient recall, health literacy (including younger children who may not have been able to adequately identify or describe symptoms), and availability of home thermometers. Symptoms prior to enrollment were collected retrospectively, and thus timelines for specific symptoms are not available. Because symptom ascertainment and SARS-CoV-2 testing were conducted at enrollment, any subsequent symptom development or detection of viral RNA that could affect PPVs for specific symptoms were not captured in this analysis. Prior reports have indicated that some symptoms, including the classic symptoms of fever and shortness of breath, may not present until later in the illness course. 13 Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 infection within this population, the PPV identified in this analysis may not be representative of all clinical encounters. Finally, the sample size was small and was not powered for detecting differences among subpopulations, and resulted in wide overlapping confidence intervals for the reported PPVs.",

            "text": "and April 2020, CDC, in partnership with Wisconsin Department of Health Services and local health departments in Milwaukee County, conducted a household study that included known COVID-19 index cases and their household members. This investigation provided an opportunity to identify household COVID-19 cases and describe their symptom profiles, including loss of taste and smell. This investigation ascertained symptoms prior to diagnosis for household contacts of COVID-19 index cases, similar to how patients might present in a clinical setting early in the course of illness. We enrolled 90 participants from 26 households, including 26 index cases and 64 household members. Overall, 48 (53%) study participants were male; 69 (77%) were adults \u2265 18 years old; 41 (46%) were black non-Hispanic/Latino, 37 (41%) were white non-Hispanic/Latino, and 12 (13%) were other races/ethnicities. Preexisting medical conditions were reported by 39 (43%) participants, including asthma or reactive airway disease (n=13), hypertension (n=10), and diabetes (n=8). Upon enrollment, 16/64 (25%) household contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a total of 42/90 (47%) COVID-19 cases. Median time from symptom onset to enrollment for index cases and symptomatic household cases was 14.5 days [interquartile range (IQR): 10.0-19.0] and 7.0 days (IQR 5.0-7.5), respectively.",

All participants completed questionnaires assessing basic demographic information, medical history, symptoms since the household index case's disease onset, and other epidemiological information. A parent or legal guardian assisted in completing questionnaires for children <18 years. At enrollment, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from all participants; to fulfill a secondary objective of this investigation, nasal self-collect (NSC) swabs were also collected from index cases and household members with classic symptoms of COVID-19 infection.Swabs were tested by the City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. 14 Any participant having a SARS-CoV-2-positive NP swab collected in the 10 days prior to enrollment (26 index cases and 2 household contacts) or a SARS-CoV-2-positive NP or NSC swab collected at enrollment was classified as a COVID-19 case. Prevalence of symptoms among cases was compared descriptively. Bivariate analyses of demographic variables, medical history, and symptoms of reported loss of taste and/or smell were computed using two-tailed Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. To calculate the positive predictive value and 95% CIs of individual symptoms for COVID-19 among household contacts, we used any PCR-positive swab as the gold standard for diagnosis..
