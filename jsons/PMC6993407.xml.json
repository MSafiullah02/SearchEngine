However, higher level of resistance against meropenem was documented in Taiwan (73.2%) [41] and Saudi (81.8%) [42]. The relatively lower proportion resistance against meropenem in the present study might be linked with the nonexistence of meropenem prescription practice in the study hospital. In contrast, lower level of resistance against meropenem was reported in Uganda (14%) [26] and Turkey (20.4%) [40]. This could be due to variation in the availability of meropenem in each localities, prescription difference, misuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics.",
