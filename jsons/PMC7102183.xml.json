It also stimulates the migration and morphogenesis of those cells as reported in the previous in vitro studies.4, 5 Yaekashiwa et al6 demonstrated that continuous systemic injection of recombinant HGF suppressed pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in the mice model. HGF had significant effect when it was administered simultaneously or subsequently to bleomycin treatment.6 Although these studies suggested the therapeutic potential of recombinant HGF for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the feasibility of HGF gene transfer has not been fully explored. When delivered to the lung in vivo, in addition to the innate immune response or nonspecific inflammation, cellular and humoral immune responses are especially critical issues in the use of viral vectors. Furthermore, pathologically abnormal lungs present disease-specific barriers that can limit gene transfer.7",

On the other hand, serious concerns regarding the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and induction of the host immune response limit their clinical desirability. When a retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer was used, an antihypertensive gene was transmitted to the offspring and integrated into its genome.8 In liver-directed clinical gene therapy, adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer induced fulminant hepatic failure that lead to mortality.9 Adenoassociate virus (AAV) vector have been found to be efficient for transducing nonproliferating cells and is considered to be nonpathogenic. Gene delivery by AAV vector also appears to be the least immunogenic of the viral vector systems. However, a major problem associated with the use of AAV vector has been the difficulty in producing large quantities of high-titer stock.",

Limited fundamental therapeutic options are available to date.1 A number of animal models and therapeutic agents were developed to explore the possibility of a new fundamental strategy against pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin-induced pneumopathy is a well-established model of pulmonary fibrosis. Acute toxicity of bleomycin is characterized as the DNA damage of pulmonary tissue, which results in apoptosis.2 As found in bleomycin-treated mice,27 Fas expression in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells and upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression are also found in clinical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients.28 Furthermore, an activation of apoptotic pathway was found in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),29 or other experimental models, such as lipopolysaccharide,30, 31 hyperoxia,32, 33 asbestos,34 and ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury,35 Thus, apoptosis is a common feature found in both clinical and experimental models of lung injury. Following the acute toxicity of bleomycin, immunological mechanisms by T cells, its cytokines and natural killer cells also concern the progression of lung fibrosis.3, 36, 37 In concurrence with these processes, extravasation of plasma through hyperpermeable vasculatures and injured alveolar walls occurs and tissue factor triggers the coagulation cascade, leading to fibrin deposition.38 Fibrin matrix serves as a scaffold in which fibroblasts migrate and induce collagen deposition.",

            "text": "From the therapeutic point of view, suppressions of apoptosis and fibrinogenesis are critical in prevention of the onset and progression of lung fibrosis. As HGF has both antiapoptotic and fibrinolytic potential as described above, HGF is one of the ideal therapeutic agents for lung fibrosis. Yaekashiwa et al6 reported that systemic injection of recombinant HGF suppressed pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in a mice model. Although their study suggested the therapeutic potential of HGF for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, relatively high dose and continuous administration of recombinant HGF were required to induce those therapeutic effects. Since HGF has a short half-life (T1/2 3\u20135 min), HGF gene therapy would be desirable from a clinical point of view.",

            "text": "In current clinical gene therapy, viral vector-mediated gene transfer is the most popular gene delivery system. However, in the use of adenoviral vector or retroviral vector, serious concerns regarding the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and induction of the host immune response limit their clinical desirability. With regard to newly developed AAV vector, it has been found to be efficient for transducing nonproliferating cells and is considered to be nonpathogenic. Gene delivery by AAV vector also appears to be less immunogenic. However, a major problem associated with the use of AAV vector has been the difficulty in producing large quantities of high-titer stock. Therefore, we previously explored the in vivo nonviral gene transfer systems, such as particle delivery using gene gun10, 11, 12 and electroporation using pulse generator,13 to avoid these viral vector related problems.8, 9 In the gene gun-mediated gene transfer to the mice liver, gene expression was observed even on day 1 and persisted for 2\u20135 weeks, and exclusive in the gene gun bombarded area.10 With a regard to in vivo electroporation, we investigated the feasibility of HGF gene transfer via the portal vein in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced rat liver fibrosis. HGF gene transfer attenuated the fibrotic change and prolonged the survival of DMN rats, and also reduced the apoptotic cell death.13 However, these nonviral gene transfer methods also induced infiltration of inflammatory cells and mechanical damage in the site of gene transfer. On the other hand, in vivo lung-targeting gene therapy has been challenging due to the physical extracellular barriers, such as mucus, mucociliary clearance and glycocalyx proteins, and the innate or adaptive immunological systems.7 Preclinical and clinical studies of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggested that current levels of gene expression were too low to achieve clinical benefit. Repetitive administrations of viral vectors were also limited by the formation of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, almost all previous studies including the lung-directed one used the diseased organ as a target site to induce efficient transgene expression locally. However, we should avoid putting the diseased organ at risk as the targets of gene transfer. Therefore, in this study, we selected the skeletal muscle as a gene transfer site using nonviral in vivo electroporation system to avoid these problems in lung gene therapy.",

Concerning the survival analysis of bleomycin-injected mice, Hattori et al42 reported the significant improvement of the survival rate of the mice deleted for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene compared with that of wild-type mice. They suggested that the protective effect of PAI deletion could be attributed to the accelerated clearance of fibrin matrices. Their result emphasized the importance of fibrinogenesis suppression.
