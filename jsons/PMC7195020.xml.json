            "text": "In this study, we will use a 3-group parallel (1:1:1), single-blind design (see Fig. 1\n). We will recruit and enroll 300 individuals with chronic pain, with a low back pain problem experienced as a primary or secondary pain condition in the past 6-months. Participants will be randomly assigned to eight, 1.5 h, group Zoom videoconference sessions of CT, MM, or AS. Mechanism and outcome variables will be assessed twice daily during the 2-week baseline, 4-week treatment period, and 4-week post-treatment epoch via random cue-elicited EMA; physical activity level will be monitored during these time epochs via daily monitoring using ActiGraph technology. Follow-up assessments of mechanism and outcome variables will be conducted at 3- and 6-months post-treatment. The primary endpoint for the primary study aim (Aim 1) is the post-treatment pain interference score, operationalized as an average of pain interference ratings made on the twice-daily diaries during the first four days after treatment. The endpoint for the secondary study aim (Aim 2) is the post-treatment score at 28 days follow-up, as operationalized as the average of pain interference ratings on the diaries from the final four days of the immediate post-treatment follow-up period. All study procedures were piloted and developed in preliminary work by the investigative team. Specifically germane to this proposal, we have conducted numerous clinical trials examining psychological interventions based on the techniques investigated in this study for CLBP and other pain conditions [[19], [20], [21], [22]], including telehealth assessment and treatment delivery [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27]]. We have also published multiple studies examining treatment mechanisms and have a great deal of experience in implementing EMA, with compliance rates exceeding 85% [14,15,21,[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]]. This study is pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03687762). The trial protocol follows Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [49]. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.",

The b coefficient in this model represents the effect of early treatment change in the mechanism variable on subsequent late treatment change in outcome. A significant b coefficient would support Hypothesis 1a for that mechanism variable. Significant a1 or a2 coefficients, indicating between-treatment condition differences in early changes in mechanism variables, would support Hypothesis 1c (the Specific Mechanisms Model). Post-hoc analyses would then be performed to determine which treatment resulted in greater changes in the mechanism variable being examined. If both the a1 and a2 coefficients are not statistically significant, this would be consistent with Hypothesis 1b (i.e., the Shared Mechanisms Model) for that mechanism variable.",
