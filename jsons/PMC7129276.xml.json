They have been proven to be effective in preventing infections that previously had high morbidity and mortality. An example of this is the eradication of small pox, which was mainly attributed to successful vaccination programs. Preventing a high burden disease has since proven to be a cost effective measure and, as such, vaccines have become a part of multiple national health programs. These promising results led to the development of more and more vaccines and to the study of its applicability in other fields such as cancer prevention and treatment.",

It has also been shown that the autoimmune reaction elicited by an infectious agent can be effective in treating cancer. An example of this is that bladder administration of BCG (bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin) has been shown to be effective against superficial bladder cancer development [28].

The quantities of aluminum to which infants, in their first year of age are exposed, have been considered safe by the FDA. However the scientific basis for this recommendation does not take into account aluminum persistence in the body. The concern about aluminum in dietary intake has been reinforced by the Food and Agriculture (FAO) WHO Expert Committee, which lowered the provisional tolerable weekly intake of aluminum from 7 mg/kg/bw (490 mg/week, for an average 70 kg human) to 1 mg/kg/bw (70 mg/week) [61].",

Out of these 119 cases, 33 were classified as PM, 85 as DM and an only one as a sIBM. DM has been reported after almost any vaccine, however only a few studies have attempted to clarify the possible relationship between DM and vaccination. PM is a frequent misdiagnosed disorder. Some reports have associated previous immunization, especially hepatitis B vaccine with PM [250]. Despite being recently differentiated from other IIM, sIBM has already been related to HBV vaccine [250]. Some vaccines associated with myositis are MMR vaccine, smallpox vaccine, Poliomyelitis (IPV), diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, influenza, HPV and BCG [250].",
