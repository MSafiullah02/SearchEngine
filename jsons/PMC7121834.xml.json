As the earlier adoption in commercial sector revealed their privacy harming aspects and resulting public concerns towards the indiscriminate use of personal data by industries [21, 33], it is imperative to address the potential benefits on health of public and risks to individuals liberties of Big Data and Web 2.0 applications/technologies.

Across age groups, Internet usage showed the steepest increase among seniors, climbing from 14% in 2000 to 58% in 2015. Driving this change is the widespread use of smartphones, which are owned by nearly two-thirds of adults in 2015 in developed nations, and undergoing rapid uptake in developing nations [52, 53]. In addition, the socioeconomic difference in the use of SNS appears to be absent in the U.S. [54], which suggests the equitable quality of health promotion through this channel.",

Unlike screening test which are typically performed with informed participation, predictive algorithms can secretly profile millions of social media users without awareness of those who are targeted.

Simply focusing on unidirectional communications ignoring the interactivity, tailoring, and peer engagement is likely to add little value over traditional communication channels. Efforts should be allocated towards leveraging the user-centric features of participatory applications to meet heterogeneous needs of population subgroups, and the tailored messaging should encourage informed decision-making for people with varying language, cultural background, disability, health and technological literacy and numeracy [101\u2013103]. With the media-rich feature of the Internet, messages can be conveyed by the combination of images and video for the latter users for enhanced uptake [45].",
