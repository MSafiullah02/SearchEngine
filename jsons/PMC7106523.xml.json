Cardiovirus A contains two serotypes of Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), which are well known causes of myocarditis in animals. Human infections with EMCV were recently diagnosed using isolation and serology, but no human case of myocarditis due to EMCV has been identified [1]. The Cardiovirus B species includes Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus, which is known to cause encephalitis and myocarditis [2], Thera virus, Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus and the recent described human virus; Saffold virus (SAFV).",

In addition to the positive findings in respiratory specimens and stool samples, SAFV has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and the myocardium, indicating an invasive potential [6], [7]. In the first study, SAFV was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of two children \u22644 years of age, one of which died without preexisting symptoms. In this child, SAFV was also detected in a myocardial biopsy. In the second study, 10 myocardial biopsies were tested, and one was positive in a nested PCR assay, but not in real-time PCR. However, no histopathological alteration could be demonstrated in the myocardium of either of the two cases. In our study, we found SAFV in the respiratory secretion, blood and myocardial tissue of a child and histological evidence of inflammation in two related organs (heart and lungs). This combination is novel and may point to a role of SAFV in organ-related diseases.",

            "text": "The histological alterations in the myocardium and lung tissue primarily consisted of lymphocytes, which is suggestive of an infection of viral origin. The inflammatory changes in the myocardium were less pronounced than the changes in the lungs. Myocarditis is known to be a condition that causes both focal and diffuse inflammation, and even a small lesion may have a significant clinical impact [10]. The presence of viremia and the detection of SAFV in respiratory secretion and myocardium combined with the absence of other detectable pathogens in the myocardium, made SAFV plausible as a causative agent of the inflammatory changes. The low concentration of SAFV in the myocardium compared to blood and respiratory secretion may have been caused by the use of FFPE myocardial tissue as there is a known decreased sensitivity of virus detection in FFPE tissue. This may also be a likely explanation for the negative result of SAFV analysis on FFPE lung tissue. However, a higher concentration of viral RNA in the myocardium compared to lung tissue is also a possibility. The possibility of detecting RNA targets in postmortem tissue samples depends on several parameters including postmortem interval, fixation time, pH in fixation solution, and RNA extraction method [11]. In this study, we could detect a control RNA target in more than 90% of the study samples suggesting a reasonable RNA detection sensitivity and integrity in our FFPE material. Other studies have established that FFPE tissue material is usable for reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis of virus and messenger RNA, although the analytical sensitivity is reduced when compared to the use of matched frozen tissue material [12].",

Future studies preferably using unfixed material should establish the presence of the virus inside the infected myocytes. Another limitation is the age of the study cohort varying from 3 weeks to 77 years, with the mean being 34.7 years. Thirteen cases were below the age of 5 years. In prior studies as well as in this study, SAFV has mainly been detected in different compartments of young children, indicating that infection with SAFV occurs early in life [10], [13], [14].
