            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in February 2003, caused by the deadly coronavirus, affected 3547 individuals, resulting in 182 deaths by April 2003 [1]. In recent history, numerous emerging and re-emerging viruses have caused widespread human disease and deaths, raising worldwide fears. The most well-known examples are the avian influenza H5N1 virus in 1997, the H7N9 virus in 2013, and the swine influenza H1N1 virus in 2009\u20132010. Although the transmission modes of viruses are diverse, wastewater is recognized as an important source of contaminated microbial aerosols and liquid. Given the importance of this factor in virus transmission [2], a number of research projects have focused on developing highly effective inactivation/separation water treatment techniques [3], [4]. However, virus are submicroscopic particles. As such, the conventional filtration methods are generally less effective; furthermore, biofouling also leads to extra operational costs [5]. When considering UV and chlorination inactivation techniques, a number of pathogens, particularly some virus species, are naturally resistant to such traditional treatments [6], [7]. In addition, the formations of toxic and potential carcinogenic by-products are also drawbacks of chlorine treatment [8], [9], [10]. Ozone disinfection has been considered as an effective alternative [11]; however, disadvantages, such as its toxic and corrosive characteristics, also hinder its practical application [12].",

Nevertheless, PC inactivation of adenovirus has not been previously attempted, despite being indicated in the \u201cDrinking Water Contaminant Candidate List\u201d [17] because of their prevalent potential health risks and important role for water epidemiology [18], [19], [20]. Moreover, adenoviruses are highly resistant to common treatments when compared to other viral pathogens of concern in wastewater and drinking water [21], [22], due to their DNA\u2019s double-stranded nature [23].",

In this study, we investigate the application of PC and PEC-based bactericidal techniques in the presence of halides to for inactivation of replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRADS). The specific study scope was to systematically evaluate and quantitatively compare the virucidal performance of PC and PEC treatment of RDRADS in the presence and absence of halides such as Cl\u2212 and Br\u2212, using RDRADS encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The infectivity of the RDRADS can be accurately and conveniently determined using this method, because the virus encodes a GFP gene that can be expressed in host cells [28].",

The virus concentrated with the centrifuge was finally diluted with sterilized H2O to a desired concentration for the experiment.

For the PEC degradation experiments, a 0.1 M NaNO3 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte, and a voltammograph (cv-27, BAS) was used for electrochemical control. Potential and current signals were monitored using a Macintosh computer (7220/200) coupled with a Maclab 400 interface (AD Instruments). A suspended solution containing a known number of RDRADS and 0.1 M of NaNO3 prepared in sterilized tubes on a super clean bench was continuously injected into the cell via a precision pump during the inactivation process. The inactivation time of each sample was controlled by adjusting the flow rate. A sufficient volume of the inactivation sample was collected for further analysis after the system reached its steady-state. A 0.1 M NaNO3 solution was used to clean the cell between the two sample injections. The samples collected after PEC treatment were analyzed the infectivity by green fluorescence of PK15 (pig kidney) cells. For assaying virus infectivity, 100 \u03bcl samples were added into 80% confluent PK15 cell monolayer (Fig. S1) in 48-well plates.",

Fig. 6\nshows the photocurrent responses obtained from 0.1 M NaNO3 solution and 0.1 M NaNO3 solution containing Br\u2212 or Cl\u2212 at a given concentration. In the absence of X\u2212, the photocurrent is originated from the photocatalytic oxidation of water, which is directly proportional to the production rate of AOSs [24], [32]. An increase in halide ions concentration leads to an increase in the photocurrent. The net photocurrent increase results from the photocatalytic oxidation of halides, which should be directly proportional to the production rate of X-based viricides (e.g., X\u2022/X2\n\u2022\u2212, X2, HOX/XO\u2212) [26].",

However, which of the X-based viricides (e.g., X\u2022/X2\n\u2022\u2212, X2, HOX/XO\u2212) generated from photocatalytic oxidation of X\u2212 need to be further discussed. Considering the relatively low standard potentials of Cl2/Cl\u2212 and Br2/Br\u2212 (+1.36 and +1.087 V, respectively), it is unlikely that these halogen species are the main contributors to the enhancement inactivation efficiency. Moreover, the standard potentials of HOCl/Cl\u2212 and HOBr/Br\u2212 are +1.63 and +1.33 V, respectively. Although the oxidation power of these species are not high, they should be sufficient to cause damage to the capsid of nonenveloped viruses (such as adenovirus), whose capsid is composed of protein polypeptides. Also, HOX prefers to react with amino acids with an amino group side chains [38], and is particular effective to inactivate proteins containing sulfhydryl groups [38]. Therefore, HOX could play an important role in the damage of the protein capsid of RDRADS.",

It should be noted that X\u2212 serves as an electron mediator during the photocatalytic inactivation process [26]. It is photocatalytically oxidized at the illuminated TiO2 surface to form the reactive species and regenerated when reacting with virus (see Eq. (2)).

The results confirm that the virucidal efficiency can be enhanced in presence of a low concentration of halides and further enhanced by applying photoelectrocatalysis. The PEC-Br treatment shows the best virucidal performance, capable of completely inactivating a \u223c1000 TCID50 RDRADS population within 31.7 s. The superior virucidal performances of PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased production of AOSs and X-based viricides, and prolonged lifetime of h+ for direct inactivation. The findings of this work confirm that new forms of active species generated in situ via a PC or PEC process are effective for not only bacteria, but also viruses. In theory, the proposed method can be used to kill other types of viruses and to decompose organic pollutants.",
