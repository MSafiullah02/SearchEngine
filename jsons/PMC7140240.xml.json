Nevertheless, IO scholars have paid little attention to the implications that a crisis may have for the specific roles of IOs in such circumstances, and even less so from the organisation\u2019s point of view. This gap can be partly explained by a lack of interaction between the IO and crisis management (CM) literature.",

At the same time, we surmise that the centralisation notion developed in the CM literature cannot be readily applied to an IO situation because of differences between the domestic and international spheres. Domestically, an implementing agency is separate from and, ultimately, accountable to the government, whereas internationally, an IO and its executive agency (the secretariat) are partly constituted by and accountable to many different member states.",

We thus start from the premise that all IOs, irrespective of their relative policy autonomy, are kept on a short leash by their owners (member states), which makes member states likely to centralise decision-making within an IO when events on the ground seem to threaten the basic arrangement between member states and the IO. However, we learn from the CM literature that there are good reasons to expect crisis management to deviate from everyday organisational life because of uncertainty, urgency and threats to core values, which require the ability to engage in swift \u2013 but decentralised \u2013 decision-making. Moreover, crises are valuable objects of study from an organisational and institutional perspective due to their ability to alter organisational processes and power structures (Boin et al.\n2005).",

Inspired by both the CM and IO literatures, this article presents a comparative case analysis based on actors\u2019 time perceptions and their precrisis institutional legal frameworks. These issues are explored by focusing on three crisis incidents, which all displayed significant transborder characteristics and, to varying degrees, international crisis management roles were played by IOs: the European Union (EU) during the 1990s BSE scandal, the WHO during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemics, and the UN during the protracted crisis between 1993 and 1996 in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region. This article is structured as follows: after examining key conceptual issues, we discuss the lack of mutual interest in the IO and CM literatures by defining and comparing key concepts in each area. Subsequently, we theorise about the conditions under which centralisation of decision-making occurs in the context of an IO\u2019s involvement in a transborder crisis and how this centralisation affects the IO\u2019s position. This section is followed by an analysis of the three cases. The article concludes by presenting a research agenda for the field of IO crisis management.",

There is a long-standing tradition among IO scholars of assessing the role that IOs play in managing conflicts between states. However, IO scholars remain largely ignorant of the growing body of expertise in crisis management, although they often employ the term international crisis (without always addressing the concept of a crisis). Similarly, IOs have been of limited interest to CM researchers, who have so far focused on managing single crises within one nation, policy sector or organisation (Weick and Sutcliffe 2007). A discrete interest in the transboundary nature of crises and crisis management has been developed recently (Rhinard et al.\n2006; Boin 2009; Boin et al.\n2013; Galaz et al.\n2011) without the influence of the IO literature. This interest may be explained by CM\u2019s dominant managerial perspective, which directs researchers towards management issues within a specific, confined organisation or nation-state.",

            "text": "Although frequently used, the term international crisis is difficult to define. First, its conceptualisation differs in the IO and CM literatures: whereas the CM literature adopts predominantly a subjectivist notion of crisis, the IO literature uses mostly objectivist definitions. In the latter, the researcher seeks to determine the extent to which a social system is on the verge of collapse (cf. Brecher and Wilkenfeld 2000: 4\u20135). In contrast, when applying a subjectivist notion, the researcher uses actors\u2019 crisis perceptions as the point of departure (Hermann 1969). Classical CM definitions describe crises as events that are perceived to threaten actors\u2019 high-priority goals, to restrict the amount of time available, and to surprise members of the decision unit (ibid.: 413). Similar criteria tend to characterise later definitions in which surprise is often exchanged for substantial uncertainty (Rosenthal et al.\n1989). In contrast, it seems that IO scholars use mostly an objectivist notion of crisis linking important international events with potential threats that they pose to local, regional or global stability. Both conceptualisations contribute to crisis studies in different ways; the subjectivist notion of crisis, however, is better suited to studying bureaucratic dynamics within IOs. It allows for the possibility that an IO perceives a situation not only as a threat to its global stakeholders but also as a potential threat to, or opportunity for, the IO itself.",

What constitutes a crisis may also vary over time: high interest rates on Italian government bonds posed a problem for the Berlusconi government in November 2011 but not for the succeeding government 1 month later. Moreover, some actors perceive a crisis as an opportunity to further their interests rather than as a threat. It is thus essential to understand how crises are framed and to be alert to who benefits from these various frames.",

Disaster often refers to crises whose origins are natural causes, such as earthquakes and typhoons. Emergency in the CM literature most often refers to routine incidents predominantly taking place in the blue light emergency sector. For the purposes of this article, all situations are relevant to the extent that various actors define them as crises. At the same time, emergencies and disasters pose different challenges to IOs than do, for example, inter- and intrastate violent conflicts, and may thus have a different effect on an IO\u2019s autonomy.",

            "text": "Fourth, the conceptualisation of time differs in the CM and IO literatures. Within the CM literature, time perspectives are usually determined by (perceptions of) the crisis event and, thus, they relate to well-defined and narrow points in time. Crisis managers are portrayed as following clearly structured sequential processes based on problem detection, management and aftermath reform (Boin et al.\n2005). This CM focus on the management of acute situations is mirrored by the neglect of long-term and structural effects. As a result, there is little interest in complex and long-term crisis events that involve many actors and move through different phases. This sequential time perspective is poorly suited to long-term issues such as the involvement of the UN in various conflicts, which have been the focus of IO research. Given the increased involvement of IOs in crisis management today, it is vital that both intellectual traditions open up to one another. In this article, we take up one potential bridge between these literatures: the centralisation of decision-making and its effect on IO autonomy. In exploring the notion of centralisation from the CM literature, which largely builds on public administration and organisational theories, this paper is part of the so-called \u2018administrative turn\u2019 in IO studies in which IOs are understood as compounded organisations in which both formal and informal processes and practices impact the actions undertaken (Ness and Brechin 1988; Trondal et al.\n2010).",

            "text": "The CM literature has a rich tradition of addressing a multitude of organisational and societal crisis-related issues, such as sense making, decision-making, leadership and coordination. A classic debate amongst CM scholars concerns the trade-offs between centralised and decentralised responses to crises (cf. Pollitt 2009). At heart, crises are political events dominated by power struggles and politicisation (Boin et al.\n2005). How these battles play out depends on organisational and leadership dynamics. The commonly held position, especially in the field of security studies, has been that crises tend to centralise leadership at the highest organisational level (Hermann 1963). Centralisation is most often explained by the logic that the greater the threat, in terms of uncertainty and perceived political prizes, the stronger the incentives for political control (Rosenthal et al.\n1991). From an accountability perspective, citizens tend to demand that their leaders step up in critical situations (Boin and \u2019t Hart 2003). Centralisation usually takes place through the establishment of small groups, consisting of top-level politicians, advisers or managers, which shortens the lines of authority and information to ensure a swift response (Holsti 1972; Paige 1968; Lagadec 1990; Hermann 1963).",

This is so because centralisation risks creating information and decision-making bottlenecks based on cognitive and time limitations within the top managerial groups (\u2019t Hart et al.\n1993). According to Weick (1988), a centralised crisis management system runs the risk of neglecting individuals and agencies with relevant expertise and of diminishing problem-solving capacities. To overcome the structural weaknesses inherent in centralised responses and to ensure speed and flexibility, decentralisation tends to take place at the operational level (Dinan et al.\n2006). Decentralised responses also provide decision-makers with advantages from a political strategic perspective because they provide governments with the best of both worlds: if the response is successful, the government can claim credit, but if not, it can distance itself from the response (ibid.). As previously noted, there is a lack of research exploring the notion of centralisation in an IO context. Based on a theoretical analysis of the European Union, Boin et al. (2014) argue that there is no best model for handling transboundary crises; rather, a certain degree of decentralisation ought to be combined with elements of centralisation to lead agencies.",

(1993), crisis decision-making patterns can be understood through the effects of three variables: the degree of the perceived time pressure, the operational versus strategic levels of decision-making, and the precrisis organisational structure. Time pressure is expected to have an impact: when decision-makers perceive high time pressure, this leads to the adaption of organisational structures into ad hoc centralised responses. However, low time pressure allows for more formal and pre-planned responses. Time pressure is also felt differently at the operational and strategic levels. At the operational level, time pressure is felt more directly, requiring instant responses, whereas at the strategic level, decision-makers tend to be more concerned with the long-term effects of events. Finally, the precrisis structure impacts centralisation and decentralisation: mechanistic pre-existing structures characterised by routine-oriented bureaucratic hierarchy and formal chains of command and communication tend to centralise responses, whereas pragmatic pre-existing structures, such as matrix or project organisations, tend to be characterised by informal decentralisation or strategic evasion.",

Examining centralisation and decentralisation in an IO context, we base our analysis on the notions of time pressure and the pre-existing organisational structures, as described above. It should thus be noted that a crisis in an IO context differs from a national crisis. Translating discussions from the CM literature into an IO context is thus not unproblematic. First, in an IO context, it is not immediately clear what centralisation entails: as observed above, CM scholars study crises within the context of a sovereign state. One important difference is that, in a national context, the central government presumably has the authority and capacity to overrule operational units during a crisis. Centralisation thus usually indicates the concentration of authority in the hands of the political and administrative elite. In an IO context, no clear authority exists. Thus, in an IO context, centralisation may involve the concentration of authority in the hands of the highest administrative level (usually the secretary general) of the organisation or in member states. In this article, we conceptualise decentralisation as providing IOs with more autonomy, while centralisation involves member states dominating decision-making. We will explain IO autonomy in detail below.",

In the CM literature, agency is often used for depicting organisational units in the public sphere that are responsible for specific tasks, like the EU agencies such as Europol (cf. Groenleer 2009). This is how we use the term agent in this contribution. In the IR literature, however, agency refers to the debate whether specific actors in world politics actually matter, in the sense that their behaviour is purposeful and has a causal effect in international relations. In this context, agency presumes that actors are able to formulate preferences and enjoy the capabilities to act freely, although within constraints (Wendt 1987). This notion dovetails with CM\u2019s notion of autonomy, which refers to the capacity to manage one\u2019s own affairs. An autonomous agent, however, is not fully independent and is still constrained, legally or politically. Autonomy may refer to an agent\u2019s decision-making competencies and to the degree to which it is exempt from constraints to use these competencies (Busuioc et al.\n2011: 850\u2013851; Groenleer 2009: 29\u201339; Verhoest et al.\n2004: 107\u2013108).

Cox and Jacobson 1973). Two approaches exist to defining an IO. In the first approach, IOs contain both member states and an international secretariat. The UN Security Council (UNSC) is powerful when at least nine members endorse a resolution and the five permanent member states (China, France, Russia, the UK and the USA) abstain or vote in favour. Although we may investigate the role of the UN Secretary General, nothing is accomplished without the consent of the most powerful member states. From this perspective, a powerful European Union (EU) suggests that strong EU policies require the consent of its most powerful member states, particularly France and Germany. During the early years of the financial crisis, all European eyes were directed at the so-called \u2018Merkozy tandem\u2019 of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, without whom progress was not expected. In this conception, member states that found and participate in an IO determine its autonomy.",

Reinalda and Verbeek 1998: 3\u20134; Suvarierol et al.\n2013). From this perspective, member states, although legal constituents of any IO, are part of the environment in which the secretariat must operate. This environment also includes the formal and informal norms guiding the policy area of which the IO is part. As we shall see below, these norms may strengthen or hinder an IO\u2019s autonomy.

Although nation-states have always sought to influence IOs through nationals who work for the international secretariat (cf. Weiss 1982), the loyalty of international civil servants to the IO has become an accepted international norm. Similar rules apply to European civil servants, although that picture is effectively more complicated: although they enjoy the same status, some European bureaucrats serve the Council (and thus, member states) whereas others serve supranational institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Court of Justice or the European Central Bank. In principle, IO secretariats possess autonomy. Under certain conditions, IOs may convince member states to accept policies that conflict with their narrow interests. However, IOs may be punished if they are persistently perceived as hindering the major powers. Punishment can come in many forms: member states may block reappointment, seek to redefine a secretariat\u2019s mission, or withhold funding.",

            "text": "In walking this tight rope, the leaders of IOs must also take into account various formal and informal norms. These norms may both hinder and help them. The propensity for autonomy thus varies across IOs, and the autonomy of supranational institutions such as the Commission \u2018depends crucially on the efficacy, and [\u2026] [this varies] from institution to institution \u2013 as well from issue-area to issue-area and over time \u2013, leading to various patterns of supranational autonomy\u2019 (Pollack 1997: 101). From this perspective, IO autonomy refers to the capacity for autonomy from member states and to the formulation of interests that are neutral or impartial as regards member states (Barnett and Finnemore 2004). From a principal agent perspective, IOs have the best opportunities to exhibit autonomy when they possess an information advantage over member states, when they act in an environment wherein member states can be played against one another, and when they are favoured by decision-making procedures (Reinalda and Verbeek 2004: 23). According to Barnett and Finnemore (1999, 2004), IOs can have four types of authority, i.e. delegated, legal, expert and moral. Legal authority underscores the weight of procedures and rules, which helps IOs appear independent, technocratic and value neutral. Taken together, these aspects provide an image of decision-making as impersonal and free of ideological and political considerations. Furthermore, IOs derive authority from the fact that they are established with certain mandates and expectations by their member states. This fact feeds into their moral authority, which is derived from the fact that IOs are typically created to protect and act in the interest of the common good and thus stand above politics. IOs operate in environments of formal and informal norms, which impact their authority (cf. Joachim et al.\n2007).",

For most IOs, impartiality (or neutrality) and integrity are fundamental norms (cf. Terry 2002). These norms are nested in the general international regime governing the UN, which centred on the sovereignty of states and noninterference in domestic affairs during the Cold War. These norms are a double-edged sword. If handled well, norms can serve as an IO leader\u2019s weapon to find his or her way through the minefield of major member states\u2019 interests. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld initially succeeded in making his mark by framing the UN neutrality as connected to promoting international peace. During the 1956 Suez crisis, this framing enabled him to create the neutral United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), contributing to de-escalation of the conflict (Lyon 2007: 128\u2013130). However, if major proponents of IOs operate in such a way that they can be accused of taking sides or engaging in corruption, they will damage the IOs\u2019 reputations and effectiveness (Kille 2007: 12\u201313). Changes in the overall regime have granted top UN officials more leeway to navigate the minefield of neutrality and impartiality. The end of the Cold War ended the tendency of the major powers to judge the UN\u2019s behaviour primarily in terms of East\u2013West competition. Additionally, partly in response to the mass killings in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s, it has become acceptable for the international community to interfere in domestic affairs in cases of extreme atrocities (Bellamy 2010). Although state sovereignty remains the cornerstone of the global framework, new norms have made it easier for top UN officials to take sides and have rendered it more difficult for states to fight them simply by accusing them of partiality.",

The case selection was based on differences in two independent variables: the degree of the perceived time pressure and the organisational precrisis structure.\nTime pressure: Time pressure is related to the acuteness of a crisis, i.e. the immediacy and severity with which its transborder consequences take effect. The more acute a crisis, the more limited the time available to respond and, thus, the higher the time pressure perceived by IOs. The SARS crisis thus counts as the case with the highest time pressure, as SARS was a lethal, previously unknown virus, which spread from Hong Kong to 37 different countries in a matter of weeks. The Mad Cow Disease crisis is a case with a medium level of the perceived time pressure, as the disease was known and there were few human cases despite its infectiousness. Finally, the Rwandan crisis is a case of low time pressure because the refugee problem increased slowly over years. The CM literature expects centralisation to occur when the perceived time pressure is high (\u2019t Hart et al.\n1993). We would thus expect the greatest centralisation to occur in the WHO case and the least in the Rwanda case. The IO literature suggests that under high time pressure member states are more restrictive of secretariats and thus reduce their relative autonomy, and vice versa. Autonomy displayed by the UN in Rwanda is thus expected to be greater than autonomy displayed by the WHO in the SARS case.\nOrganisational pre\ncrisis structure. The IOs were selected on the basis of differences in the institutional legal framework within which they have to operate. The European Commission operates within the strongest framework because the Commission possesses exclusive competency within the areas of health and food security and is embedded in a strong and codified system of enforcement. At the other extreme, we find the UN Security Council, which formally makes binding decisions but depends on consensus among its permanent members for decisions and on individual UN member states for enforcement. The WHO occupies a middle position: it has certain specific policymaking competencies but no legal system for reinforcement. We expect IOs to demonstrate more autonomy when the legal framework entails more formal competencies. The European Commission is thus expected to display the highest level of autonomy and the UN General Secretariat the lowest (Table 1). \n\n",

First pillar issues are jointly governed by the EU institutions in terms of member states (through the Council), the Commission and the European Parliament. The Commission looks after the common European interest and is the only body allowed to initiate new legislation and ensure its implementation. The Commission is divided into several Directorates General (DG), each responsible for a certain policy area. Moreover, every DG includes a number of committees consisting of national experts who play important roles in decision-making. The committees serve as a link between the Council and the Commission and provide forums for negotiation. There are three types of executive committees: consultative (which can consult on issues), administrative (which can block decisions) and prescriptive (which have the power to approve decisions). If a crisis occurs in the agricultural sector, the main actors will be member states, representative veterinarians in the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC), and the Commission (unless stated otherwise, the empirical data are derived from Gr\u00f6nvall 2000).",

On March 20, 1996, the British government announced that experts had likely discovered a new variant of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jacobs Disease (CJD) in ten people. This announcement caused great turmoil because experts could not rule out that the victims had been infected with human BSE by consuming BSE-infected beef. Panic spread across Europe following the announcement, triggering governments to ban British beef and beef products.

Which conditions affected the Commission\u2019s position? First, perceiving the issue as an exclusively British problem, the Commission missed the opportunity to frame the issue early in the process and thus mould the EU response. Instead, the Commission followed its everyday decision-making procedures, which meant utilising its expert committees to examine new information before proceeding to formulate a proposal to the SVC. According to the treaties, decisions by member states must be approved by the Commission. In this case, the UK did not inform the Commission before its public announcement, bypassing the Commission as did the other member states when they decided unilaterally to ban British beef. The Commission became involved only when other member states implemented unilateral import bans that breached the EU legislation. Member states thus bypassed the very institution created to manage transborder health safety problems within the EU. Member states declared that the concerns about health and safety expressed by their citizens had prompted them to act unilaterally. Regardless of the reasons, national action precluded a common approach. The effects were disturbance of the common market, irritation within the EU because the BSE scare spilled over into other health areas and economic effects, because many other countries halted imports from all EU member states.",

To avoid additional political bargaining in the Council, the Commission must propose a policy that it knows will prevail in the SVC. To avoid losing credibility, the Commission tends to avoid proposing measures that are undesirable to member states (Demmke 1998). A crisis reinforces this pattern because the Commission risks losing valuable time if it presents a proposal to the SVC that it knows will be dismissed. Because time is a limited resource during crises, the Commission might be more apt to take on an arena role during these times. Interestingly, although the BSE issue involved technical expertise, the Commission could not profit from its technical advantage: member states\u2019 political considerations dominated the decision-making process. In the more technically oriented SVC, national delegates received political instructions from their respective national governments. Nevertheless, the gelatine issue demonstrates that the Commission has a better chance of influencing member states when their preferences are unclear and the crisis is marked by uncertainty (cf. Pollack 1997).",

Thus, the WHO is not an implementing autonomy but has been accorded directing and coordinating authority. Consequently, during the SARS crisis, the WHO focused on coordinating global efforts aimed at identifying and containing SARS. The organisation is divided into six regional offices coordinated from its Geneva headquarters. The WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) constitute the most important standardised and legally binding measures for disease coordination and identification. Discussions about reforming the IHR had been ongoing since 1996, and a new system was formally launched in 2000. In the revised IHR, the WHO has been given a mandate to collect information proactively, including information from nongovernmental sources, instead of waiting passively for governments to provide it. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) is an important mechanism for information exchange within the IHR, spanning 120 public health institutions around the world. Drawing from various online sources, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), which is maintained by Health Canada, constitutes another important source of information. However, a major limitation of the IHR was that it only required countries to report outbreaks of cholera, yellow fever and the plague.",

On 2 April, the WHO announced the most sensitive, country-specific travel recommendations, namely, for Hong Kong and Guangdong (other travel advisories involved Beijing; Shanxi Province; Toronto; Tinjan; Inner Mongolia; Taipei, Taiwan; and Heibei Province). This announcement forced China into action, beginning national reporting and allowing a WHO team to enter the country. The team expressed grave concerns about the capacity of the Chinese health care system and its ability to engage in contact tracing and reporting. Even more worrying were rumours of systematic underreporting of cases by major hospitals in China. Finally, on 9 April, the bubble burst when a physician reported the true number of cases at Beijing\u2019s No. 309 hospital. This revelation forced China to reverse its course and adopt a policy of transparency. In Canada, the hardest-hit country outside of Asia, the response was hampered by lack of resources and poor leadership, communication and coordination (Markel and Stoney 2011). On 23 April, the WHO added Toronto, Beijing and China\u2019s Shanxi Province to its travel advisory. Canada heavily criticised this travel advice, and Canadian politicians and public health officials travelled to Geneva to urge the WHO to lift the travel advisory, arguing that the criteria for issuing travel bans were arbitrary and imposed without proper warnings (Canada Health 2003).

Furthermore, the DKPO belittled Dallaire\u2019s warnings, judging them as coming from a newcomer to peacekeeping (Barnett 2002: 87). Moreover, focusing on its assignment of peacekeeping (rather than peace enforcement), the DPKO interpreted the violence as representing a civil war rather than genocide.

The consequence of this frame was that every refugee was considered a victim. This frame also reinforced the norm of impartiality in the IO\u2019s behaviour. This served the UNHCR well in paving the way for decentralisation in which its main task was to provide humanitarian assistance. Adopting a humanitarian frame, however, implied embracing the norm of neutrality and ignoring the political dimensions of the refuge crisis in the Great Lakes region.

As expected, the highest levels of member state centralisation and the lowest level of IO autonomy were found in the UN case. Our expectation was met in the first phase of the Rwanda case, with the UNAMIR becoming dependent on the UN member states\u2019 interests, particularly those of France and the United States. However, when the definition of the Rwandan situation shifted from civil war to a humanitarian crisis, the UN increased its power through the UNHCR. A similar pattern can be seen in the EU case, when the Commission was outmanoeuvred by member states in the first phase of the crisis. During the second phase of the crisis, in connection with the gelatine issue, the Commission demonstrated a more independent role made possible by its skilful use of, and agenda setting in, the EU expert committees. Hence, our analysis suggests that although the legal institutional framework provides important cues for the decision-making dynamics, additional information is needed to understand IO autonomy during times of crisis.",

These expectations were not met because the case with the greatest time pressure \u2013 the WHO during the SARS crisis \u2013 illustrated the highest levels of IO autonomy. This reverse effect can be explained by the fact that situations characterised by high levels of time pressure and uncertainty create opportunities for IOs to play roles when member states lack adequate knowledge and solutions to the problems at hand, as discussed in more detail below. Moreover, the case with the least time pressure \u2013 the first phase of the Rwandan case \u2013 illustrates the highest level of member state influence. That case shows how actors in New York chose not to interpret the UN reports of increased violence on the ground as an impending genocide, which would have prompted an acute response. Rather, member states (joined by the UN Secretariat) actively sought to avoid involvement in Rwanda based on the events in Somalia the year before. The case that came closest to matching our expectations was the BSE crisis when member states sidestepped the Commission due to its slow response to what member states perceived as an acute problem. Interestingly, time pressure seems to impact IO autonomy, although in the opposite direction than expected, that is, higher time pressure increases the room available for IO autonomy. As seen from the discussion above, differences in outcomes could not be fully explained by the extent of time pressure or the institutional legal framework. In the following, based on our empirical findings, we present two additional propositions regarding the relation between IOs and their member states during times of crisis.",

            "text": "Based on our finding that the UN possesses the least autonomy and the WHO the greatest, we conclude that IOs that address politically sensitive issues, the so-called political IOs, are more likely to be closely watched and controlled than are the so-called technical, expertise-oriented IOs (such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the World Maritime Organisation, and the World Health Organisation). Although a technical issue may conceal important state and other interests, technical IOs are more likely to avoid open political conflict. This does not mean that these organisations are immune from member state criticism or interference. For example, the WHO was heavily criticised for its management of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. Its description of the influenza as a pandemic despite its relatively mild symptoms led to accusations of hidden political motives. However, their crucial positions within a web of technical expertise most often provide technical IOs with a source of influence vis-\u00e0-vis their member states (Barnett and Finnemore 1999, 2004; Skj\u00e6rseth and Wettestad 2010). This, we argue, is especially true during times of crisis when urgent measures are requested in a previously unknown area requiring a specific type of expertise. This ad hoc delegation of power to expert-driven IOs is enhanced by the increased levels of uncertainty inherent in a crisis, which relates both to the nature of the problem and to the policy options available. Uncertainty provides technical and expert-oriented IOs with more space to define the problem and identify potential solutions. This occurred when the Commission took the lead on the issue of gelatine due to the lack of consensus amongst member states. Similarly, the WHO\u2019s newly developed assessment capacity, built upon its nongovernmental resources and its extensive network of expertise, were effectively applied during the outbreak and further strengthened the WHO\u2019s independence from member states. Interestingly, China\u2019s initial noncompliance served to underline the risks inherent in relying upon member states\u2019 goodwill. The SARS case suggests that the WHO managed not only to maintain its mandate but also expand it in the midst of the crisis, taking on the role of government critic and assessor. Thus, decentralisation with regard to the WHO can largely be explained by its status as an independent expert autonomy working for the common good in fighting the outbreak (cf. Terry 2002; Kille 2007). At the same time, such a status would most probably not have been granted to the organisation without the time pressure.",

For example, during the first phase of the Rwandan case, UNAMIR interpreted evolving events as technical and downplayed genocide. Headquarters, however, feared a member state backlash against the UN as a whole and chose not to consider the available local expertise. Based on the discussion above and the results of the empirical study, the assumption here is that IOs\u2019 influence increases in times when addressing the crisis situation requires specific technical expertise that is possessed by or can be accessed by the IOs. That IOs with technical expertise can create more autonomy during times of crisis is foremost demonstrated by the SARS case, wherein the WHO not only had a strong influence in managing the crisis but also succeeded in strengthening its mandate.",

The empirical analysis shows that the better IOs are at framing the situation in accordance with neutrality and impartiality, the more the response is to be decentralised in their favour. For example, in the Rwandan case, the UNPK had internalised a specific definition of violent conflict in Africa based on stereotypical views and a basic notion of peacekeeping (rather than peace enforcement), which ensured that it would act as a neutral party between warring groups rather than as an organisation open to the possibility of mass killings. In the Great Lakes case, the UN framed the situation as a humanitarian crisis, which allowed the UNHCR to classify all Rwandans as refugees and provide them with legal and physical protection, thus allowing the Rwandan army to reorganise within the refugee camps and effectively establish control over the refugees, provoking a Rwandan invasion of Zaire. Interestingly, the dominant UN frame (a product of centralisation and routine) then granted autonomy to the UN organisations on the ground that maintained the routines that effectively helped continue the conflict. Impartiality was also an important ingredient in the WHO\u2019s framing of the SARS situation, albeit cast in a technical light, as the IO was perceived as the actor possessing the most cutting-edge knowledge on how to cope with the situation and benefit all member states.",

However, this framing effort failed because the Commission entered the process long after member states had formulated their preferences and because the frame it proposed was perceived as favouring the British. This episode stresses the importance of timing to successful IO framing efforts.",
