            "text": "Across Latin America, increasing access to mental health care has become a priority. Management of common mental disorders is shifting to primary care, and community mental health centers (CMHCs) are being established to treat severe needs. In urban migrant communities on the outskirts of Trujillo, Peru, five new CMHCs have been built to treat complex mental health concerns, partially in response to high rates of domestic violence and child maltreatment. However, psychologists have no training in the treatment of interpersonal trauma. This study sought to determine the utility of such a training and identify areas for cultural adaptation. Six focus groups were conducted with CMHC psychologists. Findings revealed that, while a culturally-adapted training in trauma-focused treatment is desired, sociocultural barriers to ensuring the physical and psychological safety of the service user must be considered, as well as provider barriers including short treatment packages, insufficient physical infrastructure, and unstable work conditions.",

            "text": "Recent global mental health initiatives seeking to increase access to services in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) have centered on shifting the identification and management of mild to moderate mental health problems to the primary health care (PHC) system, while communitybased psychologists take on a more supervisory and capacity building role. Simultaneously, the care of people with more complex and severe mental health problems is moving out of institutionalized settings and into community mental health as part of the deinstitutionalization of mental health care (Eaton et al. 2011; Kakuma et al. 2011; Patel et al. 2018 ). One such region making significant advances over the last decade in increasing access to mental health care is Andean South America (Pan American Health Organization 2013). Peru, for example, passed Law 29,889 in 2012, which sought to close the existing treatment gap (estimated at 70-85% countrywide) by reducing psychiatric hospital beds, increasing the capacity of the PHC system to screen and treat common mental disorders, and establishing a community mental health center (CMHC) system. However, nearly 90% of the new mental health budget was dedicated to task-shifting at the PHC level, with limited finances remaining for training, development, and implementation at the CMHC level (Toyama et al. 2017) . Capacity building initiatives are needed to help community-based psychologists develop skills in evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address complex mental health needs; without such efforts, a reduction in illness prevalence rate is unlikely (Jorm et al. 2017 ; Thornicroft et al. 2017) .",

Forty percent of Trujillo's inhabitants are rural to urban migrants from the northern Andes who moved to the coast in search of work, education, or fleeing civil unrest associated with the Shining Path movement and government response. Migrants settled into shanty-town districts on the outskirts of the city (Naranjo Morales 2007); five of the six newly introduced CMHCs in Trujillo are in these districts. While this is promising for increasing access to mental health treatment, the psychologists serving these centers have not received training on the mental health needs of the migrant communities, which are marked by alarmingly high rates of familial violence and child maltreatment. Some of the highest documented rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual abuse in all of Latin America can be found in the Trujillo migrant communities (Kohrt BK et al. 2015) . This region also reports high rates of child abuse, with nearly 11,000 cases reported in just one migrant district between 2007-2014 (Defensor\u00eda Municipal del Ni\u00f1o y el Adolescente de la Municipalidad Provincial de Trujillo 2014).",

Interpersonal trauma can be defined as a response to danger or threat of danger caused directly or indirectly by other people; examples include IPV, sexual abuse or assault, rape, and sex trafficking (Briere and Scott 2014) . Complex trauma can be defined as exposure to multiple traumatic events of an invasive and interpersonal nature that results in emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal impairment (National Child Traumatic Stress Network 2018) . Complex trauma often begins in childhood, is often perpetrated by caregivers or trusted adults, and significantly disrupts attachment relationships. This type of trauma has been linked to high rates of revictimization and self-harm behaviors, reduced productivity, functional impairment, and increased overall healthcare costs (Briere and Scott 2014) . Attending to interpersonal trauma is imperative for the developmental potential of the next generation; a 2015 study conducted within one of the Trujillo migrant communities found a relationship between a mother's experience of IPV and impaired cognitive and psychosocial development in children (Kohrt BK et al. 2015) .",

However, there are few studies on cultural adaptations of trauma-focused EBPs for the Latinx community, and no studies have been conducted in Latin America (Rivera 2008) . Thus, prior to developing a training, the research team sought to: (1) understand the new CMHC system, (2) identify the type of trauma experienced by service users, (3) understand how trauma is defined and treated by local psychologists, and (4) identify sociocultural barriers to treatment that mitigate the use of certain therapeutic approaches.",

The Mental Health Department granted permission to recruit the psychologists for the study and expressed interest in a CMHC-wide training. Four regions in Northern Peru were targeted for the study: El Porvenir, Alto Trujillo, Florencia de Mora, and Viru. These regions have a high number of migrant families and are historically underserved by the government, with poor educational and health infrastructure (Naranjo Morales 2007). Four of the five CMHCs agreed to participate; the fifth was undergoing significant staff turnover and had no active psychologists. Given that one of the primary motivating factors for the training was related to high rates of IPV and child abuse, the only domestic violence center serving the urban migrant community and the one residential center for children removed from their home for reasons of neglect, abuse, or abandonment were also contacted and agreed to participate. Six focus groups were conducted with fifteen psychologists. Each mental health center comprised its own focus group, with two to four psychologists per group. Groups met on one occasion and lasted 45-90 min.",

All focus groups highlighted how nearly all service users have experienced a trauma, with most traumas starting in childhood and being interpersonal in nature, such as physical, verbal, or sexual abuse, neglect, and forced labor. The most frequent words mentioned were abuse, sexual, physical, child, father, infancy, assault, neglect, and disasters. Grandfather, uncle, stepfather, and neighbor were also mentioned frequently. Cycles of violence and intergenerational trauma were mentioned by more than half of participants, as exemplified by Psychologist 11: Several psychologists stated that environmental triggers of trauma in the migrant communities made hyperarousal especially pernicious at certain times of the day and days of the week. The typical informal sector work week in Peru is Monday through Saturday, thus starting Saturday evening through Monday morning the men in the community \"come home.\" This coming home is tied to increased alcohol use and increased instances of IPV and child abuse (Kohrt BA et al. 2015; Kohrt BK et al. 2015) . In addition, a lack of street lighting in the communities coinciding with the time of day that men leave work makes it difficult for women to identify who is coming towards them, causing increased hypervigilance at sundown. These triggers are mentioned below by Psychologists 5 and 3 respectively. The effect of trauma on services users was described as leaving them \"\u2026never at peace\" (Psychologist 7). The most commonly reported impacts were related to selfworth, identity, and goals (mentioned by 13 of the 15 psychologists) while the second most common was a decrease in interpersonal functioning (mentioned by 10 of the 15 psychologists). The belief that trauma changes your neurobiology, and that the brain and body are deeply implicated both in the experience of and treatment for trauma, was mentioned in each focus group. Only two psychologists mentioned that trauma affects a person's ability to experience, identify, and regulate emotions. The impact of trauma on one's identity can be seen in the quote below from Psychologist 7. Given that many initial traumas were perpetrated by family members, deep feelings of mistrust of parental figures was noted, as well as anger towards the nonoffending caregiver for not protecting the survivor. Many psychologists stated that this contributes to clients entering unhealthy relationships characterized by power and control. Every focus group mentioned blame and shame, stating that it was incredibly common for the service user to believe they caused their own trauma. Women carrying blame as part of living in a misogynistic society was mentioned frequently, and the fact that the system reiterates this blame was a significant barrier to treatment. One psychologist (Psychologist 6) stated, \"shame and blame are the strongest weapons that society has against women.\"",

Improved self-worth was often reflected in hygiene and dress, with most psychologists describing how the service users would suddenly start \"arreglandose\" or getting dressed and made up, as described below by Psychologist 8. Improved social and interpersonal functioning was the second most common theme related to a client overcoming trauma, which included improved parenting abilities and readiness for romantic relationships. Signs of neurocognitive and behavioral recovery were also mentioned, including the ability to talk about the trauma in the past tense, reduced physiological response to triggers, reduced avoidance, and viewing their trauma as part of their story, but not as their identity. Several psychologists raised ideas regarding what could protect communities from developing symptoms following a traumatic event. Specifically, a connection with nature, living in a community with less urban crowding, and a strong faith in God were seen as factors buffering against traumatic stress.",

Specifically, it is common in these areas for children to be left alone with older siblings, cousins, neighbors, or non-blood relatives (e.g. step-fathers) while primary caregivers are working. Combined with a lack of education about sexual health and rights, high alcohol use amongst men, and machismo, this can often lead to young girls, and at times boys, being Connected to this barrier were factors related to urban migration and overcrowding. As discussed previously, many service users in this region are from the northern Andes of Peru, where there is a higher percentage of indigenous persons, a tendency for more conservative beliefs, and a norm of not verbalizing individual suffering if it will affect familial well-being. When these families migrate to urban areas, they are constrained to small spaces with no physical barriers between rooms due to economic limitations and government squatting policies. The combination of these sociocultural and physical factors can increase risk for interpersonal abuse, as explained by Psychologist 15. In addition, psychologists working primarily with women in situations of violence stated that the lack of collaboration and \"misogynist tendencies\" by the police compromised their ability to provide patients with the physical safety and support needed to be able to engage in meaningful therapeutic work. These psychologists reported that their female service users do not feel they can report partner violence or refuse sex. Psychologist 9 describes how women are restricted from financial independence, which can trap them in situations of violence. This systemic machismo meant that many women were ambivalent about reporting abuse, which could lead to episodes of verbal hostility against providers by the women or their families. Insufficient enforcement of laws and policies to protect clients was mentioned frequently; while laws against IPV and child maltreatment exist, the process is lengthy and often interrupted by strikes, administration changes, or other bureaucratic procedures. Blaming of the survivor by the police or court system was also frequently discussed as a barrier to helping their clients attain safety, justice, and peace of mind, as exemplified below by Psychologists 13 and 8 respectively.

This included the fact that most psychologists were on government contracts that had to be renewed annually; each year there was potential that they could be let go. This lack of stability made it difficult for them to advocate for their clients' needs. Budget cuts or misuse of funds by ministry officials sometimes meant that psychologists were forced to take unpaid, month-long vacations when money ran out, leaving only 1-2 of the staff psychologists active; active psychologists were expected to pick up their colleagues' caseloads, exacerbating the workload burden. The Ministry of Health also demanded remarkably high caseloads, with some individuals required to see 16 patients in a seven-hour shift. This was not the case across centers; other psychologists were able to provide 40-60-min sessions, but this inconsistency resulted in significant frustration amongst psychologists interviewed. Psychologists also reported that the Ministry of Health dictated how many sessions a client could have, which often meant treatment was discontinued before it was really completed. This is described below by Psychologist 2. Physical infrastructure of the mental health centers was also mentioned frequently as a barrier to care. Psychologists mentioned how they often share offices, at times attending to service users simultaneously. Offices are often loud, and other staff or service users will knock or interrupt sessions.",

Going against the cultural grain meant at times having to give up relationships or sacrifice close family ties, as described below by Psychologists 9 and 7 respectively. Finally, a lack of training in trauma-focused therapies was mentioned as a barrier to effective treatment, as was access to curriculum appropriate for their context and culture. In terms of desired training, psychologists reported wanting to learn specific techniques for treating trauma and related symptomatology.

Given the feedback in the focus groups, physical safety is not something that psychologists will be able to assume when someone presents for treatment. Many psychologists spoke about barriers to safety, including a lenient justice system, a misogynistic culture of blaming women by the police and other authorities, and economic dependence on the perpetrators, all of which reduce the likelihood that violence and abuse will be reported or prosecuted. In addition, the presence of intergenerational trauma nested within these sociocultural dynamics can result in mothers disbelieving their children's report of interfamilial abuse due to the potential for their own re-experiencing, limiting their ability to act as protectors of child survivors. Similarly, a primary goal of this phase is to reduce the fear and autonomic arousal one experiences when faced with trauma triggers. However, in this environment, some hypervigilance could be adaptive. Thus, necessary training considerations include how to help the client attain physical safety without justice system involvement and different treatment targets if the perpetrator continues to have contact with the survivor.",

Cultural taboos in Andean Peru around discussing sexuality openly will require consideration around how to best provide education on a person's rights without violating cultural norms; this should be done in consultation with local churches, education centers, and mental health professionals. Similarly, one of the surprising findings from the domestic violence center focus group was that once the staff themselves learned more about gender role stereotypes as a mechanism of power and control, they struggled to fit in with their families and began to have conflict with partners. One psychologist even left her church and divorced her husband. While none of the psychologists regretted these decisions, given the stigma around both receiving and providing mental health care, it will be important to address relationships and sexuality in a way that does not ostracize the service users or service providers from their support systems.",

The first barrier is related to the community mental health treatment packages. The treatments identified in the literature range from eight sessions to multi-year treatment, with the majority clustering around 12--24 sessions in addition to some type of skills group or peer support group, especially in the case of complex trauma. In the target region for this capacity building project, only patients with severe mental illness (SMI) diagnoses would be able to attend that many sessions; those presenting specifically for violence and maltreatment are typically only provided with five sessions. While some centers appear to have flexibility in asking for another treatment \"package,\" this was not universal. We may consider discussing each phase of treatment as its own package, with the goal of increasing client retention by encouraging initial commitment to smaller numbers of sessions while developing safety and stability.",

            "text": "Further, two factors related to the mental health practitioners themselves should be considered based on the findings of this study. First, several responses within the focus groups suggested the presence of mental health stigma within providers, especially toward migrants from Andean Peru. Recent literature suggests that many mental health professionals, especially in low-resource contexts, endorse beliefs that clients with mental illness are dangerous, difficult to treat, and incapable of productivity or autonomy (Corrigan et al. 2014; Cusack et al. 2016 ). Such beliefs have been found to negatively affect mental health access, the quality of treatment, and therapeutic outcome (Lauber et al. 2006) . Higher levels of stigma have also been tied to higher levels of staff burnout, and recent work examining mental health integration into medical settings in LMICs have found trainings to be less effective when provider stigma is not directly targeted (Gibb et al. 2010; Kohrt et al. 2018 ). Thus, it will be important within our capacity building model to intentionally measure and aim to reduce provider stigma. Second, individuals working with complex trauma understandably experience high rates of compassion fatigue and are susceptible to secondary trauma, with this phenomena being even more likely for service providers embedded within systems that fail to protect the survivor as was commonly cited in the focus groups (Craig and Sprang 2010) . A handful of psychologists also spoke about their own trauma, history of violence, and \"personal problems\" as inhibiting their ability to serve this population, thus specific discussion around strategies for managing compassion fatigue and secondary trauma should be included.",

However, given that our goal is to create a training that is as grounded in the target community as possible, limiting participants to those serving the urban migrant community was prioritized over a larger sample size of mental health professionals in Trujillo in general. Another important limitation is related to foreigner status and privilege. Many parts of Peru are marked by colorism, with a tendency to view lighter-skinned individuals, and individuals from the Northern hemisphere, as having more authority and education (Golash-Boza 2010; Norwood 2013 ). This may have affected the way the primary author was perceived, which may have altered the responses provided within the focus groups. Further, in an attempt to increase access to EBPs for psychologists in this region, it is important to acknowledge that the literature for trauma is disproportionately conducted in high-income countries, thus our attempt to embed a training into this framework will be undoubtedly biased by western views of scientific evidence and efficacious treatment. It is our hope that the use of participatory methods and intentional crosscultural adaptation techniques will help mitigate some of these limitations.",

The new community mental health system in Northern Peru provides an exciting opportunity for capacity building of service providers, while high rates of complex and interpersonal trauma, and lack of training in this area, suggest that focusing on trauma is an important initial capacity building target. While a phase model can be used, it will require significant sociocultural and contextual adaptations, and authors must iteratively consider how their own privilege and background shape the training content and evaluation of success. The next step of this study is to design the capacity building model, which will be completed in close collaboration with cultural informants and local providers, and will be approved by the local Ministry of Health prior to the training.",

Thus, it will be important in the future to turn attention towards preventative measures related to gender-based violence (GBV). Research on reducing GBV states that changing attitudes is crucial towards changing behaviors, and recommend two primary prevention types: (1) small group, participatory workshops that build prosocial skills, encourage personal reflection and debate, and promote collective action, and (2) \"edutainment\" efforts that focus on radio, theater, and tv campaigns (Ellsberg et al. 2015; Heise 2011 ). There are a handful of programs, including Program H/Program M in Brazil, and Stepping Stones in South Africa, that have been successfully integrated these types of programs into the public school system and community. Both programs have been effective in helping boys and young men shift strict gender attitudes that contribute to gender-based violence, and preliminary findings also show a moderate reduction in GBV (Barker et al. 2010; Gibbs et al. 2015; Ricardo et al. 2010) . A consideration of how similar programs could be used in Peru is an important future direction.",
