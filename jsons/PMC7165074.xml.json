Times such as these bring to mind early scientists, who, through systematic doubt, created a foundation from which truth could be ascertained. Rene Descartes, asserted, \u201cje pense, donc je suis\u201d (I think therefore I am). Essentially, doubting our existence served as a basis to establish a reality of mind. How profound, yet remarkably simple. Yet so much routine, like the well-played grooves of an old vinyl record, invariably leads to habitualization, harmonious comfort that in our current world is terribly dangerous.",

It was a rule out, but that did not matter, as I was forced to start from yet another reminder of my BA in philosophy, the tabula rasa, i.e. Locke\u2019s theory that humans are at birth a clean slate. We had to rethink the entirety of the conventional operative approach given how little has been established regarding risk, in the setting of COVID-19 and its transmission [1]. Our consent had to be verbal, as paper was a potential vector, if you will, of unknown infection. The patient had to be both draped and masked for transport, dressed as if traveling to a morgue, thus requiring continuous reinforcement of life.",

We chose to perform the case laparoscopically, thus minimizing peri- and post-operative narcotics and exposures, in a patient already a respiratory cripple due to comorbidity, for whom a stoma was ultimately necessary given that newly diagnosed carcinomatosis was causing acute obstruction. However, despite diligent suctioning and filtration, this itself was a risk as it has been suggested that aerosols and plumes secondary to laparoscopy are a potential, if not greater, source of transmission [3].",
