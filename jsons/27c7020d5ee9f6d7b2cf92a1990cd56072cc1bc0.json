We used a simple epidemic model to evaluate how contact tracing might enable modification of current physical distancing restrictions. Testing and tracing coverage need to exceed 50% in order for contact tracing to reduce transmission by at least 10%. With 90% testing and tracing as well as high isolation and quarantine efficacy, contact tracing could reduce overall transmission by >45%, which would allow for partial loosening of physical distancing measures. Benefits of contact tracing could be enhanced by testing all contacts rather than only those with symptoms and by policies to support high adherence to voluntary isolation and quarantine.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Guidelines for contact tracing call for identifying and monitoring individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed positive cases, facilitation of testing for symptomatic contacts, and counseling and follow-up to encourage voluntary self-isolation, quarantine and symptom monitoring. 10, 11 Several previous papers have considered the role of contact tracing for containment of COVID-19, [12] [13] [14] [15] but important questions remain about potential impact given uncertainty around the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of voluntary isolation and quarantine. As decision-makers look toward relaxing current physical distancing measures, there is an urgent need to quantify the degree to which contact tracing programs could allow for partial loosening of restrictions while maintaining control over resurgent infection.",

Under these parameters, containment would be possible if relaxed physical distancing measures on their own could maintain Rt below 1.67, because the further reduction by a factor of 0.6 due to contact tracing would bring Rt below 1.0.

Another potential benefit of testing asymptomatic contacts, not captured in our model, is that negative test results could reduce the number of people needing to quarantine presumptively or could reduce the duration of quarantine, which might produce positive health and economic impacts. 24 For contact tracing to be most effective, broadening testing guidelines to include asymptomatic contacts will be important once testing capacity bottlenecks are addressed. The benefits of contact tracing also depend substantially on levels of adherence to isolation and quarantine among traced cases, which could be enhanced through policies such as providing voluntary out-of-home accommodations and income replacement.",

Many uncertainties persist, including the extent of asymptomatic prevalence and transmission.
