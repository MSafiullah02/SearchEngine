            "text": "In recent years, new types of interactive analytical dashboard features have emerged for operational decision support systems (DSS). Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment , including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-ofthe-loop syndrome.

Dashboards and their underlying features have become an essential approach to addressing this challenge [4] . Negash and Gray [5] describe dashboards as one of the most effective analysis tools. As the interaction between operational decision-makers and decision support systems (DSS) largely occurs via graphical user interfaces (GUIs) [3] , the design and implemented features of a dashboard are of specific importance for the effectiveness of a DSS, particularly at the operational level [4] . Over the years, research has proposed several possible solution types. A first research direction focuses on reporting current operations to inform operational decision-makers [3] . Such dashboards are rather static by nature and do not interact with the user. Static dashboards focus on visual features, which attempt to Echoing this concern, a second research direction complements static dashboards with functional features [6] . Functional features refer indirectly to visualization but define what the dashboard is capable of doing [4] . The aim is to create interactive dashboards that involve users during data analysis. Scientific articles in this stream suggest that individuals should drill down, roll up, or filter information, or are automatically alerted to business situations [7] . Such involvement appears to support users' comprehension of the complex nature of the data. However, obtaining this understanding comes at the expense of cognitive effort and time required to process the data manually, which might lead to delayed decisions or errors [8] .",

Such dashboards recognize the limits of low human involvement with static dashboards, the high human involvement with interactive dashboards, and value the introduction of interactive analytical features [10] . The idea is to solve optimization problems automatically via computational approaches in the backend (analytical component) but to (still) involve the individual in the optimization process via the GUI (interactive component) [11] . Implementations range from robust trial-and-error to more advanced approaches such as interactive multi-objective optimization [12] . Yigitbasioglu and Velcu [4] and Pauwels et al. [9] argue that the promise of interactive analytical features such as a what-if analysis is unrealized in current dashboard solutions for operational DSS.

For instance, Wu and Acharya [27] outlined a basic GUI design in the context of metal ingot casting. In addition, another study by Zhang [28] visualized large amounts of managerial data for evaluating its feasibility. There is a need to understand how planners effectively use dashboards because planning is not a static, one-time activity but rather requires continuous adaption of vast data amounts.

However, such dashboards do not involve the user in the data visualization process and have issues with handling complex and multidimensional data [6] . Interactive dashboards can be considered a step toward directly involving the user in the analysis process. Interactive dashboards consider not only visual features, but also introduce functional features such as point and click interactivity [4] . These capabilities allow operational decisionmakers to enable more elaborate analyses [6] . Addressing the impediments of static dashboards, they are used to establish a better understanding of the complex nature of data, which can also foster decisionmaking. However, the benefits of interactivity could increase the users' cognitive effort and required manual analysis time, increasing the probability of delayed decisions or (even) errors [8] .",

The underlying reasoning is that a better SA can increase the control and handling of the system by the individual and thus contribute to task performance. Studies confirmed this relationship in different domains (e.g., automotive, military, or aviation). A decrease of SA is often correlated with reduced task performance, representing the most critical cause of aviation disasters in a review of over 200 incidents [57] .

Their ages ranged from 20 to 34 years, with an average age of 24.1 years. We used students as a proxy for dashboard users in APS. We relied on students because similar laboratory experiments have shown that students are an appropriate population not normally biased by real-world experiences [60] . Second, the costs (e.g., financial compensation, physically presence at the campus) to incentivize students to take part in the experiment are relatively low. In turn, one of the main limitations of relying on professionals in experiments is that it is problematic to incentivize them [59] . Third, APS represents a challenging, complex, and cognitivedemanding task. IS students have learned the abilities or knowledge to apply it in complex contexts. Hence, these students seem to fulfill the necessary prerequisite for conducting the experimental task. In this line, we concur with the review by Katok [59] that students can perform as good as professionals do. Bolton et al. [61] confirmed this conclusion in a carefully executed experiment. Fourth, to account for the lack of system experience, we applied different techniques to prepare participants for using the dashboard (e.g., personal support, training tasks, small groups, help button). Because both dashboards participants committed 2.5 errors on average, it appears that they had no difficulties in using them. Lastly, we discussed our study with two production planners and followed their experienced advice regarding several aspects, that is, how to assess the degree of SA and performance or how to design both dashboard types and determine appropriate areas of interest (AoI).",

Different components (e.g., bicycle handlebar, bell, lamp, reflectors, tire, chair) were available for each bicycle. Hereby, the amount of available components or which component was required for which bicycle could differ. Per planning week, only a limited amount of components was available. In addition, for each product, the minimal amount of planned customer demands of all planning weeks was offered. Customer demands represented the basis for the calculation of needed components per planning week. In total, four planning weeks had to be planned by the participants so that all constraints were met and the total revenue was maximized. Three parameters were critical to generate an effective production plan: (i) the number of available components, (ii) the number of products to be produced (demand), and (iii) information about which component is linked to which product. Both designs shared the same APS process and objective to create an optimal production plan solving a planning problem within the given constraints. Both plans comprised initial states and planning restrictions. The initial state was characterized by a set of raw data that did not comply with the planning restrictions. For each plan, all decision packages shared the same complexity. The initial raw data for both plans only differed in their conditions, such as component numbers or weekly demand. We introduced constraints to ensure that users could execute the tasks within an appropriate amount of time: component shortage represented the only restriction for planning, whereas human and machine resources were assumed unrestricted.

These findings illustrate the danger for operational decision-makers of trusting the system results implicitly or (even) of \"overtrust\", leading to potentially adverse effects such as an out-ofthe-loop problem [53] . With increasing simulation abilities, operational decision-makers can become less aware and slower acting in recognizing problems on their own. Thus, if problems require manual intervention, further time is necessary to comprehend \"what is going on\", which sets boundaries on a quick problem resolution. Following this argumentation, eye-tracking studies [64] confirmed that continuous use of simulation reduces individuals' cognitive skill set because such skills rapidly deteriorate in the absence of practice. These effects can lead to an increasing tool dependence and problems when the underlying optimization model or procedures are not implemented, trained, or tested for the current situation [11] .",

This design trend accounts for the challenges decision-makers are facing at the operational level. For instance, they must make increasingly business-critical decisions in a shorter period with exponentially growing amounts of data. In such situations, operational decision-makers experience increasingly high mental workload in their attempt to process data with their own working memory [8]a rather limited, laggard, and error-prone resource [66] . Over the long term, this design trend drives continuously reducing the human level of authority in the optimization process.

One issue refers to the difficulty of constructing an optimization model that accounts for all aspects of the real problem (i.e., diversity/ number of constraints). In other cases, the problem is not completely specified due to a lack of context knowledge or must be (over-)simplified to be appropriate for the computational optimization approach. Other issues relate to the optimization procedure, which might not be appropriately parameterized before leveraging the system under real circumstances. Furthermore, the performance of the optimization method might not fit the real user requirements. Thus, the importance of having more realistic optimization models and more efficient optimization procedures is indisputable;",

Such a trend endorses a higher interaction of operational decision-makers with interactive analytical dashboards. The underlying reasoning is to realize an effective human-computer interaction but simultaneously consider the cognitive abilities of individuals. Our analyses showed that the degree of SA human beings possess defines a relevant factor in such a system design. One promising design attempt might be to introduce a periodic SA audit to increase the cognitive engagement of an operational decision-maker. Gaze-aware feedback could implement such an audit. This technique has already shown promising improvements in operational decision-makers' visual scanning behavior. Sharma J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [67] revealed that gaze-aware feedback showed beneficial effects for both a teacher's visual attention allocation and students' gain in knowledge in an e-learning context. However, despite the promising results using eye-tracking data to assess participants' SA, our analysis raised (at least) partial concerns concerning the validity of eye-tracking data to predict the number of errors.",

Further, it entails downstream effects on the human ability to make informed decisions. We created a model that relates a what-if analysis to support SA that, in turn, would positively affect task performance. We conducted one large-scale laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking and SAGAT data, to study this model from a holistic viewpoint.",

We also reported that the implementation of a what-if analysis is not cost-free and can trigger adverse effects such as a loss of SA. This finding confirms the notion of the out-of-the-loop syndrome applying in the APS context and extends it to the dashboard feature level. In addition, our correlation analyses indicated the expected link of SA to task performance. Although multiple studies have shown the relevance of SA for decision-making, we illustrated that low task performance could result from good SA and vice versa. Thus, we believe that other influencing variables could be involved in converting SA into successful performance that require further assessment. However, how SA is assessed is also fundamental because correlations within both dashboard alternatives differed according to the measurements concerning the link of SA to task performance. The SAGAT scores confirmed this relationship for both alternatives, whereas the eye-tracking data showed significant correlations only for the interactive analytical design. We, therefore, provided evidence that using SAGAT seems most appropriate.",

Such features (still) involve the operational decision-maker in the optimization process via the GUI (interactive component). Computational approaches and software tools solve the optimization problem in the backend (analytical component). Any optimization system contains an optimization model and optimization procedures to solve an optimization problem automatically. An optimization model describes an approximation of a real-world problem. Usually, it includes the definition of the objectives, decision variables, and constraints of the optimization problem. The problem data define the values of the parameter of the optimization model when the optimization problem is triggered. In turn, the optimization procedure solves the problem instances directly linked to the optimization problem by issuing either candidate solutions or intermediate results. An intermediate result is not necessarily a solution and refers to information obtained during this optimization process. Candidate solutions are final solutions to an optimization problem [11]. Interactive optimization systems involve the user at some point in time, allowing him or her to modify the outcomes of the optimization system significantly. These systems leverage user feedback from the presented candidate solutions and intermediate results to adjust either the optimization model or the optimization procedures via a preference model. The preference model contains the preference information obtained from the user feedback [12]. Common examples of a preference model represent weight values in an objective function or heuristic information for the optimization procedure. The user can refer to different interactive analytical features to offer various forms of feedback to the produced candidate solution or intermediate results. The user feedback can consist of adjustments of parameter values leveraging interactive multi-objective optimization. In an interactive evolutionary algorithm, the user can choose the most promising solution from a set of alternatives. Trial-and-error features are used for both modifying the optimization model and optimization procedures. The first approach corresponds to a what-if analysis in which the user modifies the data, constraints, or objectives of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fthe optimization problem, whereas the optimization system offers a solution for evaluating these adjustments. In the second case, users modify some parameter values in an optimization procedure.",

First, our analyses indicated that the interactive analytical dashboard showed significantly higher task performance. This result confirms the value of interactive analytical dashboards and encourages the trend toward introducing interactive analytical features for operational decision-making. We showed that a what-if analysis has the potential to direct participants to the most critical pieces of information such as bottleneck components that require immediate attention. Obstacles to the what-if analysis included a lack of knowledge of operational decision-makers of the current planning situation, which, in turn, resulted in a lower degree of SA (compared with the interactive design). However, our results indicated that if the underlying optimization model and optimization procedure can account for the planning situation (as in our experiment), high-performance outcomes can be possible even in the absence of high participant SA levels. When a planner searches for optimization potential by identifying bottleneck components within production data, the optimization system leads the participant to certain areas of interest. Such focusing, by definition, removes awareness of the ongoing production context, decreasing the overall SA. In conclusion, these cases appear beneficial for task performance as long as the employed optimization model and optimization procedures behind the what-if analysis are capable of addressing the occurring situation.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Second, our analyses revealed that the introduction of interactive analytical features is not cost-free.",
