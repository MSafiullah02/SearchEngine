The oxidized form of graphene, or graphene oxide (GO, Fig. 1), has been extensively explored in both basic and biomedical research largely because of its good biocompatibility, colloidal dispersibility in aqueous solution, flexible surface chemistry, amphiphilicity, and superior fluorescence quenching capability (Loh et al., 2010; Morales-Narvaez et al., 2012). Studies have demonstrated that the GO surface may interact through pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions (Park et al., 2013) with various biomolecules, including thrombin (Chang et al., 2010), dopamine (Wang et al., 2009), nucleic acids (Lu et al., 2009), peptides (Wang et al., 2011a), proteins (Mu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012), and lipids (Frost et al., 2012).",

Additionally, the fluorescence quenching property of GO leads to a wide range of active research and development of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors (Wang et al., 2010). The nano-sized GO (nGO, 50\u2013300 nm) has been engineered, often by tuning GO preparation conditions, for use in intracellular delivery (Luo et al., 2010; Pan et al., 2011). The mechanism underlying GO cellular uptake remains to be determined; however, endocytosis appears to be involved in the process. Versatile covalent functionalization can be achieved through hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups present on the GO surface to enhance its physiochemical, electrochemical, or biological properties depending on the application (Huang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Various GO-based enzymatic activity assay systems have been developed to target nucleases (Lee and Min, 2012), methyltransferases (Lee et al., 2011), and caspases (Wang et al., 2011b). Here, we focus on the first reported GO-based enzyme activity assay, namely the GO-based helicase activity assay (GOHA), and its use in identifying helicase nsP13 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV, SCV) (Jang et al., 2010). SARS is a viral respiratory disease in humans characterized by flu-like symptoms and high mortality rates. SCV helicases have been recognized as a primary target for direct-acting antiviral agents against SARS (Huang et al., 2008). The GOHA platform relies on the preferential binding of GO to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the quenching of DNA-conjugated fluorescent dyes when the GO and dyes are present in close proximity. Strong adsorption of single-stranded nucleotides to GO is mediated by pi-pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings in the exposed bases that constitute single-stranded nucleotides and the sp2 hybridized hexagonal structure of GO (Liu et al., 2008; Varghese et al., 2009). Contrary to ssDNA, dsDNA cannot interact with GO because the bases of dsDNA are located inside the double helix within the negatively charged phosphate backbone (He et al., 2010). Unwinding of dsDNA is initiated by addition of SCV helicases to a mixture of fluorescence-labeled substrate dsDNA and GO. As the helicase reaction proceeds, the fluorescence intensity decreases due to the energy transfer-mediated quenching that occurs upon binding of unwound ssDNA to the GO surface (Fig. 1). The GOHA platform is a good example of a GO-based enzymatic biosensor due to its highly selective adsorption to ssDNA and exceptionally high fluorescence quenching ability. Further application of GOHA for more pathophysiological relevance has been extensively studied including a robust and cost-effective drug discovery platform.",

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to severe liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma (Choo et al., 1989; Francesco et al., 2005). At present, a combination of PEG-conjugated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin is routinely prescribed for treating hepatitis C infection. Interferon-\u03b1 is an immune booster and ribavirin is a nucleoside-mimicking derivative that causes lethal mutations in the virus during RNA replication and indirectly contributes to sustaining the immune response against HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3. However, this pharmacological intervention has showed only limited efficacy with significant side effects, including hemolytic anemia, depression, and fatigue. Frequent genetic mutations in HCV and drug resistance also significantly limit the effectiveness of current hepatitis treatments. For higher therapeutic efficacy, new drugs have been anticipated to target more genetically conserved proteins of HCV such as proteases. Direct-acting antiviral agents targeting the non-structural protein 3-4A serine protease (NS3-4A) (Lee et al., 2012) and non-structural protein 5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B RdRp) (Farnik and Zeuzem, 2012) in the viral replication cycle have been reported to be more effective than conventional therapy. Two inhibitors of the NS3-4A protease, telaprevir (Vertex) and boceprevir (Merck), were recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating HCV infection.",

Some assay methods have contributed significantly to unveiling the helicase reaction mechanism at the molecular level. However, according to the NIH screen data (Mukherjee et al., 2012), some antiviral candidates identified by currently available helicase assays exhibited poor activity in cell-based analysis and even turned out to interfere with the assay itself and produced false positives.",

Briefly, mGOHA employs SCV helicase and HCV NS3 helicase in a single mixed solution with DNA substrates labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes, Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The substrates were designed to selectively recognize each helicase to ensure orthogonal reactivity. Approximately 10,000 small molecules underwent a high-throughput screen using the mGOHA platform to identify potent inhibitors of target helicases (Fig. 3). After the primary and secondary screens, five inhibitors specific to each helicase and five inhibitors active towards both helicases were identified. The inhibitors exhibited 50\u2013500 \u03bcM of IC50 values on target helicases. Furthermore, most directly inhibited the ATPase activity of the target helicase. Among the five compounds identified as HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors, two compounds showed a considerable inhibitory effect on HCV gene replication following infection of the human liver cell line Huh-7. Collectively, mGOHA was demonstrated to be a successful high-throughput screening method that yields highly potent antiviral candidates without interfering with the assay itself and producing false positives. This novel assay also overcame the limitations of existing assay methods by providing reliable, reproducible, real-time quantitative monitoring of helicase activity.",
