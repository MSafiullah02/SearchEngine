            "text": "suggested that PTG describes the positive changes experienced by people as a result of their cognitive efforts to deal with challenging circumstances. Growth occurs when people in the aftermath of trauma engage in a deliberate cognitive restructuring of reality, by changing their life narrative to include a better understanding of the self, the others, and the world (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996) . (Lau et al., 2006) . In the research of Lau et al. (2006) , although a high percentage of people experienced feelings of worry, helplessness, isolation, irritation, sleeping problems and many other negative mental health effects during the SARS outbreak, for a proportion of people, SARS was also considered a chance for positive outcomes. They experienced 'social growth', as they reported greater care about their family members' feelings, were more likely to be spending time together and considered their friends more supportive. They also achieved 'personal growth', as they were spending more time to relaxand they adopted a healthier lifestyle. Also, they learnt to be grateful and appreciate their health, family, friends and everyday life, all of which are aspects of 'spiritual growth' (Lau et al., 2006 ",
