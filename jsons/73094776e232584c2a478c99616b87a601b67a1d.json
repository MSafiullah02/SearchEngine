In this regard, as intensivists, we would like to share some thoughts on how applied physiology might relate to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (pneumonitis).",

It appears that at the initial stage, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia induces high permeability type pulmonary oedema with a large capillary leak syndrome and a significant venous admixture (poorly aerated-perfused lung regions) concomitant with a loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction (Euler-Liljestrand mechanism) (2). Thus, the observed benefit after intubation and positive pressure MV, at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, does not seem to be related to the usual recruitment of lung volume but mainly to a decrease in venous return, right ventricular output, transpulmonary blood flow and finally intrapulmonary shunt (3, 4) . The positive impact of reverse Trendelenburg positioning on SaO2 values, in selected patients, can be spectacular.",

The present condition generates large areas of true pulmonary shunt (non-aerated/perfused lung regions), that further worsen oxygenation, decrease respiratory compliance and may require a higher PEEP, a lower tidal volume, prone positioning, neuromuscular blocking agents and, for the worst cases, VV-ECMO. Obviously, this second phenotype, more typical of classical ARDS, will need a longer MV period.",

However, when capillary hydrostatic pressure is low or normal as observed in high permeability type pulmonary oedema, a medication like almitrine bismesylate, that promotes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (6), may improve hypoxemia resulting from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Indeed, there are several studies indicating that upon intravenous administration, almitrine is effective in human ARDS by increasing arterial PO2 if the rise in pulmonary artery pressure is adequately supported by the right ventricle and cardiac output does not fall (7) .",

The present approach seems rational in a situation where we are facing terrible challenges in the provision of ICU beds and ventilators (9) .
