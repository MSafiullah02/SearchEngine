Classically, the potential for pathogen persistence within a host population has been defined by the critical community size, which is the number of susceptible individuals necessary to maintain unbroken chains of transmission within a population more often than not (Bartlett 1960). However, more recent studies have shown that the relationship between host population size and pathogen persistence may be modified by other processes, such as spatial structure [e.g. phocine distemper virus (Swinton et al. 1998)] and indirect transmission via vectors [e.g. plague (Buhnerkempe et al. 2011b)] or environmental reservoirs [e.g. avian influenza (Breban et al. 2009; Rohani et al. 2009)]. Similarly, chronic shedding of the pathogen by a subset of infected hosts may allow for pathogen persistence (Monack, Mueller & Falkow 2004), but parsing the role of chronic shedding remains a challenge in disease ecology (Buhnerkempe et al. 2015; Plowright et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Although some pathogens such as hepatitis B virus (Edmunds et al. 1993) nearly always result in long\u2010term infections, there is greater uncertainty regarding the role of chronic shedding in persistence of pathogens that can cause either acute, clinical illness or chronic, asymptomatic infection [e.g. feline coronavirus in cats (Foley et al. 1997), Leptospira spp. in domestic animals (Adler & de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma 2010) and Salmonella Typhi in humans (Gonzalez\u2010Escobedo, Marshall & Gunn 2011)]. Such pathogens can cause conspicuous short\u2010term outbreaks that are dominated by acute infections and are often followed by refractory periods where observable infection is rare and disease fadeout is more likely; these refractory periods are also known as inter\u2010epidemic troughs (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005; Grassly & Fraser 2006). In these scenarios, chronic shedders could act as an endogenous bridging mechanism between outbreaks [i.e. infection persists without being reintroduced (Buhnerkempe et al. 2011b)]. However, detecting and assessing the role of chronic shedding using population surveillance data are hampered by several challenges \u2013 time\u2010scale of surveillance, low prevalence and/or intensity of chronic shedding, case underreporting and interacting signals of epidemic drivers (Plowright et al. 2016).",

Thus, the duration of surveillance is likely to have profound effects on any inference made (Buhnerkempe et al. 2015; Lessler et al. 2015), especially about chronic shedding. Additionally, chronic shedders may have reduced infection loads leading to lower pathogen\u2010shedding intensities (Leonard et al. 1992; Pathak et al. 2010), or, for many host\u2013pathogen systems, most hosts experiencing acute illness recover and eliminate the pathogen rather than becoming chronic shedders (Monack, Mueller & Falkow 2004; Pathak et al. 2010). Either common, low\u2010intensity chronic shedders or rare, high\u2010intensity chronic shedders may have subtle but significant impacts on disease dynamics and management, but distinguishing between these scenarios is problematic. These inference problems are exacerbated by the universal problem of incomplete case reporting. Asymptomatic cases, whether acute or chronic, will be underreported in conventional data streams that rely on detection using obvious signs of infection (Lessler et al. 2015). Without observing these individuals directly, signatures of chronic shedding may be detected via their influence on patterns of overtly ill individuals.",

            "text": "Short\u2010term epidemic drivers can further complicate inference about the presence of chronic shedders and their role in persistence. Specifically, seasonal transmission and contact patterns have been recognized as important drivers of seasonal outbreaks (Altizer et al. 2006; Grassly & Fraser 2006). Similarly, seasonal reproduction can drive outbreaks and affect pathogen persistence through pulsed recruitment of new susceptible individuals (Peel et al. 2014). The focus on short\u2010term outbreak mechanisms, however, largely ignores the mechanisms that operate during inter\u2010epidemic troughs to enable pathogen persistence. Interactions between short\u2010term drivers, such as seasonal transmission and susceptible recruitment, and long\u2010term drivers, such as chronic carriage, will be key to understanding persistence (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005; Breban et al. 2009; Rohani et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2013). Discerning the signal of chronic shedders operating in inter\u2010epidemic troughs from epidemic drivers operating through multiple epidemic cycles remains a challenge in wildlife systems [(Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005; Buhnerkempe et al. 2015), although research has progressed on the related problem of environmental reservoirs (Breban et al. 2009; Rohani et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2013)].",

            "text": "As a case study in addressing the above challenges, we use leptospirosis in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). Leptospirosis, caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira that are transmitted primarily via urinary shedding (either directly or indirectly through environmental contamination), is a disease of global concern and affects most mammals including humans (Levett 2001; Bharti et al. 2003). In 1970, Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona was identified as the cause of a large stranding event in California sea lions where high numbers of sick or dead sea lions were observed on the coast of California and Oregon (McIlhattan et al. 1971; Vedros et al. 1971). Surveillance in stranded sea lions has revealed yearly leptospirosis outbreaks occurring between July and December since at least 1984 (Fig. 1; Gulland et al. 1996; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007). These outbreaks follow shortly after the recruitment of susceptible yearlings to the coastal population, which occurs following weaning in the spring, and coincide with altered mixing patterns linked to seasonal migrations in late summer and fall (Fig. S1, Supporting Information; Gulland et al. 1996; Zuerner et al. 2009). Genetic analyses of circulating Leptospira strains have revealed that strains isolated from California sea lions are distinct from other known strains of L. interrogans serovar Pomona, indicating that repeated spillovers from other hosts are unlikely to have driven such patterns and that Leptospira has persisted enzootically in this population for at least 30 years (Zuerner & Alt 2009). The mechanisms underlying this enzootic persistence are unclear, but chronic shedding has been hypothesized as important (Gulland et al. 1996; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007). Shedding by asymptomatic individuals has been demonstrated, and this shedding can last for 12 weeks and potentially longer (Dierauf et al. 1985; Prager et al. 2013, 2015). With asymptomatic shedders, a long history of disease surveillance, and seasonality in both transmission and susceptible recruitment, the sea lion/leptospirosis system provides a unique opportunity to assess chronic shedding as a mechanism of pathogen persistence in wildlife, and to highlight challenges researchers may face conducting similar assessments in other systems.",

We show that chronic shedding can enable Leptospira persistence within this host population, but the ability to detect signatures of chronic shedding is complicated by the time\u2010scale of surveillance data and trade\u2010offs among duration, prevalence and intensity of chronic shedding. Finally, we show how seasonal susceptible recruitment and seasonal transmission combine with chronic shedding to create observed seasonal patterns in incidence. To do this, we use knowledge of sea lion demography and Leptospira biology to build mechanistic models of pathogen spread. We fit these models to leptospirosis surveillance data from stranded sea lions using recent advances in model fitting for partially observed incidence time series (Ionides et al. 2015) and use simulations to study persistence.",

            "text": "We used stranding data collected by The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC, Sausalito, CA, USA) from 1984 to 2012 (collection methods described elsewhere; Gulland et al. 1996; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007). The TMMC stranding range includes the central and northern California coast (Fig. S2). This range is determined by jurisdictional boundaries (counties in California) rather than by animal distribution, and it covers the central portion of the migratory range of a genetically distinct population of California sea lions, the Pacific Temperate population, that extends from the US\u2013Mexico border into Canada and Alaska (Fig. S2; Schramm et al. 2009). The Pacific Temperate population of California sea lions give birth and breed on the California Channel Islands in June and July. Adult females then nurse a pup for 10\u201312 months and remain associated with the rookery islands throughout the year (Fig. S1). Although some juveniles (i.e. yearlings to 4 years old) remain around rookery islands, most males and non\u2010breeding females this age migrate north to the central California coast in fall and overwinter there. Subadult and adult males migrate north from the rookeries following the breeding season and overwinter in coastal waters from central California to British Columbia, returning south in the spring. Thus, juveniles and non\u2010nursing adult females are the age classes primarily found in the TMMC stranding range outside the breeding season, with subadult and adult males passing through the range in the autumn and spring on their north and south migrations.",

            "text": "Infection with L. interrogans serovar Pomona in this population exhibits clear, yearly outbreaks in the fall during northward migration, typically peaking from July to December. Evidence of leptospirosis is rarely observed outside this outbreak season, including in animals returning from north of the TMMC stranding range in the spring (Figs S1 and S2; Gulland et al. 1996; Greig, Gulland & Kreuder 2005; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007) or in pups and females inhabiting the rookery islands year\u2010round south of the stranding range (Figs S1 and S2; R.L. DeLong, unpublished data); available data thus indicate that seasonality in leptospirosis\u2010induced strandings reflects the true seasonality of infection in this system. In addition, leptospirosis outbreaks have exhibited clear 3\u20135 year cycles that are reflected in data from stranded sea lions (Gulland et al. 1996; Greig, Gulland & Kreuder 2005; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007). Changes in climatic and oceanographic conditions, such as El Ni\u00f1o events, impact sea lion demography (Weise, Costa & Kudela 2006; Melin et al. 2010, 2012) and may also impact the survival of leptospires (Johnson & Harris 1967). The impacts of changing environmental conditions on both sea lions and Leptospira are expected to alter periodicity in the system (Gulland et al. 1996). Deviations from the regular cyclic pattern are particularly noteworthy during the late 1990s (around the historically strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997\u20131998) when relatively large outbreaks were observed annually for several years (Fig. 1). Because we are focused on intrinsic disease drivers, large environmental perturbations may obscure signals of these drivers and are beyond the scope of this study. Hence, we focused on four 2\u00b75\u2010year eras in the stranding record that are typical of the regular cyclic pattern \u2013 an isolated large outbreak (i.e. not preceded by another large outbreak) followed by two smaller outbreaks (1984\u20131987, 1988\u20131991, 1991\u20131994 and 2004\u20132007; Fig. 1). Here, the large first outbreak depletes the susceptible pool, increasing the likelihood of post\u2010epidemic fadeout and maximizing the potential to detect signatures of chronic shedders as a persistence mechanism. Weekly data for all stranding eras began on 17 June of the first year specified to fully capture the initial outbreak for each stranding era.

We assumed acute infection lasted 2 weeks on average [i.e. the mean total residence time in I\n1, I\n2, I\n3 and I\n4 described by a \u0393(4, 4\u03b3) distribution], which was consistent with the duration of clinical disease seen in stranded sea lions (Dierauf et al. 1985; Prager et al. 2015). Alternative assumptions of 1\u2010 or 3\u2010week acute infectious periods did not change qualitative model results (Figs S3 and S4). After the acute infection phase, a proportion of individuals, \u03c1, became chronically infected, while the rest recovered. Chronic shedders recovered and ceased shedding at rate \u03b4. We assumed that chronic shedders suffered no disease\u2010induced mortality, in line with current understanding of leptospirosis in other maintenance hosts (Ellis 2015) and the observation of asymptomatic shedders amongst both wild\u2010caught and stranded sea lions (Prager et al. 2013, 2015). We assumed that immunity against the same serovar was lifelong (Adler & de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma 2010; Evangelista & Coburn 2010).",

Because pups on the rookery islands are (almost) never observed to be infected and yearlings frequently strand due to leptospirosis (Greig, Gulland & Kreuder 2005), we assumed that recruitment into the susceptible class occurred during the period from March to May when pups wean and leave the rookery islands, with susceptible recruitment set to zero for the rest of the year (Table 1; Fig. S1; Melin et al. 2000). Demographic parameters were estimated using survival and reproduction data from a long\u2010term mark\u2013resight study using branded California sea lions [(Melin et al. 2012); Table 1]. We estimated the natural mortality rate, \u03bc, from the complement of yearly survival probability, averaged over age\u2010 and sex\u2010based differences using the stable age\u2010distribution for the population, and converted to a rate assuming exponential waiting times (Table 1). Again using the stable age\u2010distribution, we calculated the average per capita birth rate from age\u2010specific yearly natality estimates; because we assume susceptible recruitment occurs following weaning, we corrected for pup mortality before weaning to determine the annual susceptible recruitment rate. This annual rate was rescaled to account for the duration of the susceptible recruitment window to arrive at the per capita susceptible recruitment rate during the weaning period, b\n1 (Table 1).",

The recognition that inference about population dynamics depends on the time\u2010scale of observation has gained traction in conservation biology and ecology more generally (Hastings 2010; Buhnerkempe et al. 2011a) but is not yet widely appreciated in disease ecology. We postulate that this is largely due to a historical focus on the basic reproduction number, R\n0 (the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a wholly susceptible population), which is typically estimated during initial invasion of a population or at a long\u2010term steady state. R\n0 alone is ill\u2010suited to address the non\u2010equilibrium dynamics occurring in inter\u2010epidemic troughs that operate on intermediate time\u2010scales and ultimately govern pathogen persistence (Grassly & Fraser 2006).

Wild captures of apparently healthy California sea lions during a leptospirosis outbreak revealed that 39% of individuals were asymptomatic shedders, suggesting the possibility of relatively common chronic shedding (Prager et al. 2013). However, surveys to detect changes in the proportions of symptomatic and asymptomatic shedders across seasons are needed to understand how fluctuations in the prevalence of chronic shedding impact persistence. Additionally, the best model fits indicated that mean chronic durations of a year or more were needed to promote persistence (Fig. 4). This relatively long\u2010lived infection is consistent with existing data, where sea lions were observed shedding leptospires for at least 12 weeks (Prager et al. 2015) or 22 weeks (Dierauf et al. 1985); however, the intensity and intermittency of chronic shedding are unknown for sea lions and most other species (Ellis 2015). In this study, the reduced transmission coefficient for chronic shedders can represent either low\u2010intensity, constant shedding or intermittent shedding following acute infection, but studies employing quantitative PCR approaches are needed to differentiate these scenarios in sea lions. As a point of comparison, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Brazil exhibit 84\u201388% prevalence of chronic shedding of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, shedding consistently and at relatively high levels, almost exclusively without symptoms (Costa et al. 2015). These traits align Norway rats with the classical \u2018maintenance host\u2019 paradigm for Leptospira. Our findings suggest that California sea lions, by exhibiting dramatic outbreaks, high morbidity and mortality, and probably lower prevalence of chronic shedding, represent a different class of \u2018maintenance hosts\u2019 that still can enable population persistence of Leptospira.",

Models without seasonal susceptible recruitment generally could not be differentiated from the full model, indicating that pulsed susceptible introduction plays a smaller role in outbreak dynamics (Fig. 5; Tables S1\u2013S4). The relatively tight window for susceptible recruitment in our system is expected to increase the amplitude of oscillations in prevalence, and increase disease fadeout as a result (Peel et al. 2014). However, the long life span of sea lions (c. 17 years for males and 20 for females) may combine with the potential for extended duration of chronic shedding to mute the impact of the susceptible pulse on the expected oscillatory behaviour (Peel et al. 2014). We also assumed susceptible recruitment was associated with springtime weaning when pups join the coastal population. Individual variation in weaning time (Melin et al. 2000) or when pups first become at risk of leptospirosis could impact assessment of the role of seasonal susceptible recruitment.",

The probability of persistence was similar in the full model and models lacking either of the short\u2010term drivers, further implicating chronic shedding as the principal driver of persistence (Tables S1\u2013S4). Overall, our findings show that seasonal transmission is the predominant driver of seasonality in outbreaks of leptospirosis in California sea lions, while chronic shedding provides the bridge over periods when transmission was generally low (Fig. 2). We modelled seasonal transmission phenomenologically without a specific mechanistic underpinning, but seasonal transmission is likely to be governed by migration patterns, geographic differences in haul\u2010out substrates, and animal density and mixing patterns at haul\u2010outs (Riedman 1990; Zuerner et al. 2009), all acting in concert with environmental changes. However, characterizing seasonality in this system is potentially limited by stranding data that only covers a portion of the migratory range of this population (Fig. S2). Despite this potential limitation, we believe that the stranding data reflect true seasonality in the system given that the major age classes affected by leptospirosis [juveniles and subadults (Greig, Gulland & Kreuder 2005; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007)] remain within the TMMC stranding range following the outbreak season. Additionally, there is no evidence of different seasonal signatures outside the TMMC stranding range, including (i) extremely rare signs of current or recent infection amongst older age classes during their southward migration from north of the stranding range and (ii) extremely rare evidence of infection in pups in the US population (R.L. DeLong, unpublished data) that inhabit the rookery islands south of the stranding range year\u2010round. These observations support the assumption that persistence via continuous chains of transmission between acutely infected individuals to the north or south of the TMMC stranding range is unlikely. However, because migration patterns and leptospirosis prevalence differ between age and sex classes (Dierauf et al. 1985; Gulland et al. 1996; Greig, Gulland & Kreuder 2005; Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007), future field and modelling studies that account for sea lion demographic structure could elucidate the mechanisms underlying seasonal transmission.",

In our system, the disease mortality rate, \u03b1, and the probability of observing a dying sea lion as a strand, p\nobs, together determine the probability that a new infection will be observed. Identifiability concerns between disease mortality and the observation probability make it difficult to tease apart the specific determinants of case observation (Fig. S9), but the combination of these two parameters yields a consistent probability of an infection resulting in an observed stranding event (3\u00b73 to 6\u00b73 of every 1000 infections stranding and being observed; Fig. S9). Because of the simplicity of our model, precise estimates of this probability are unlikely to be accurate, but qualitatively, we find that total incidence may be at least two orders of magnitude greater than the observed strandings. We did not explore potential seasonal variation in the probability of observing a strand, which could arise from seasonality in human visits to coastal sites or from sea lion migratory patterns that cause seasonal variation in the proportion of the population found within the TMMC range. However, seroprevalence data suggest that, at least during major outbreak years, Leptospira infection is likely widespread in the California sea lion population off the coast of the US, representing a significant reservoir of this zoonotic pathogen in the California coastal ecosystem (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2007).",

Environmental transmission also has a relatively small influence during outbreaks but even low levels of environmental contamination can serve to generate secondary outbreaks (Breban et al. 2009; Rohani et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2013). Environmental contamination can also play a role in the transmission of Leptospira (Levett 2001; Adler & de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma 2010), and Leptospira DNA has been detected in urine\u2010contaminated sand around stranded pinnipeds (Cameron et al. 2008). We did not account for this mode of transmission in the current model, but the long\u2010term viability of leptospires detected at haul\u2010out sites remains an open question (Cameron et al. 2008). In addition, persistence in wildlife disease systems can be achieved by spillover from alternate host reservoirs (Haydon et al. 2002). Pathogenic Leptospira is known to infect many mammal species (Levett 2001; Adler & de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma 2010). This potential persistence mechanism was not incorporated in our model, because genetic typing of L. interrogans serovar Pomona has shown that all strains isolated from California sea lions are distinct from strains previously isolated from terrestrial species (Zuerner & Alt 2009). Our group and others are actively seeking to characterize Leptospira strains in the California coastal ecosystem, which will strengthen (or overturn) the evidence for no external reservoir, but existing evidence indicates that spillover from alternative hosts does not play an important role in disease dynamics in this sea lion population. Finally, transmission from spatially distinct subpopulations can support pathogen persistence. Sea lions in the California coastal ecosystem are thought to be a genetically distinct population that migrates through the TMMC stranding range during the year (Schramm et al. 2009). Evidence of Leptospira infection has been reported in another population of California sea lions further south on the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula (Schramm et al. 2009), which may encounter our study population during its migration (particularly older males, which are likely to migrate northward following the breeding season). Currently available data on Leptospira diagnostics in the Baja population show different serologic response profiles (potentially indicating a different infecting strain) and demographic infection patterns (including evidence of infection in pups) that do not resemble patterns seen in our study population (Avalos\u2010T\u00e9llez et al. 2016). Further research is needed to identify the infecting strain in the Mexican population and to investigate possible connectivity or epidemiological interactions between these populations, to determine whether spatial coupling may contribute to pathogen persistence in this system.",

However, changes in transmissibility of Leptospira may also underlie variability in outbreak size with climatic and oceanographic conditions, such as El Ni\u00f1o events, potentially impacting sea lion condition or contact patterns (Weise, Costa & Kudela 2006) or survival of leptospires in the environment (Johnson & Harris 1967).

Models CSR (solid black line), CS (dotted red line) and CR (dashed blue line) were compared. Because of the importance of chronic infection over longer surveillance durations (Fig. 3), all models were fit with 2\u00b75 years of stranding data. Preferred models for each dataset, as determined by Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Tables S1\u2013S4), are shown above each panel. Simulations began on 17 June, and axis ticks marking the years occur on this date.",
