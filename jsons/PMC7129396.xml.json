For example, recent comprehensive influenza studies from Hong Kong have documented a burden of disease that is as high or higher than in the USA, despite the fact that Hong Kong is nearly always more warm and more humid.7 In addition, marked annual variations in incidence persist, even in areas where many spend summers in air-conditioned spaces, and similar strains of virus appear almost simultaneously across vast stretches of oceans in areas of similar latitude around the globe.15, 16 This latter feature has been particularly difficult to explain, leading some authorities to throw up their hands, and at least one investigator to propose the trans-Pacific migration of aerosolised virus on high-altitude trade winds.15, 17, 18\n",

Recent findings of patients with chronic airways disease who were PCR-positive in all seasons have raised the novel possibility that RSV establishes a state of low-level presence in the population, emerging in epidemic form when conditions are right.21 Such a mechanism for seasonal recurrence is not widely accepted for human RSV disease, but there is some evidence from the annual re-emergence of bovine RSV in closed cattle herds that chronic low-level infections might be responsible for the persistence of the viruses in these herds through the off-season.22, 23 Conditions promoting the annual re-emergence of RSV might include climatic conditions, behaviour changes such as crowding, a susceptible birth cohort, or a seasonal physiological increase in host susceptibility.20, 21\n",
