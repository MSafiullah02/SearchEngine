            "text": "The role of respiratory infections during the Hajj is nevertheless of importance, independent of the emergence of MERS\u2010CoV: respiratory illness was the leading cause of hospital admissions at the Hajj 28. A review on available cross\u2010sectional studies revealed an estimated 20% to 80% of upper respiratory tract infection among Hajj pilgrims, with influenza and rhinoviruses as the most common viral agent 29. This is in line with findings from the above\u2010mentioned studies on MERS\u2010CoV in Hajj pilgrims: in the study by Benkouiten et al. 17\n, the most commonly detected virus before, during and at the end of the Hajj was HRV in 5 of 165 (3.0%), 19 of 70 (27.1%) and 13 of 154 (8.4%), respectively. A significantly higher number of viral infections during and at the end of the Hajj were seen with 27 of 70 (38.6%) individuals positive for at least one respiratory virus during the Hajj and 17 of 154 (11.0%) pilgrims positive at the end of the Hajj compared to 8 of 165 (4.8%) pilgrims who were positive before their departure from France to KSA. 17. This suggests a probable rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses among pilgrims during their stay. Benkouiten et al. 17 report the detection of FLU A during the Hajj in 6 of 70 (8.6%) pilgrims, but did not detect FLU A at the end of the Hajj. In contrast, we found 1.3% of pilgrims positive for FLU A upon return to Ghana. In contrast to our data, Benkouiten reported only a few RSV infections with a positive finding for RSV in only 1 of 70 (1.4%) pilgrim during the Hajj. Despite the slightly different sampling time point (upon departure in KSA and after return to Ghana), further reasons for the differences between studies may be the small number reported in the cohorts, with only 165, 70 and 154 pilgrims in the French study 17 versus our cohort of 839 individuals. The different ethnic and geographic background of the cohort and therefore a different pre\u2010existing immunity may also account for the observed differences. There may also have been a difference between the seasons (2012 Hajj season versus 2013 Hajj season). Notably, in a follow\u2010up study performed during the 2013 Hajj season, the same group reported a higher prevalence of influenza than previously found, with 10 of 129 pilgrims testing positive for influenza viral RNA (8 influenza A (H3N2), 1 for influenza A (H1N1), 1 for influenza B). Furthermore, a high rate of respiratory symptoms was found with 117 of 129 (90.7%) of pilgrims reporting respiratory symptoms while still in KSA and 55 of 129 (78.6%) in the 3\u20135 weeks after their return 19, but no other respiratory viruses were screened for in the study.",

            "text": "Our data support the findings from earlier studies on lack of MERS\u2010CoV infections in returning pilgrims during the 2013 Hajj season. However, in the light of the rapidly increasing number of MERS\u2010CoV cases in early 2014 (more than 800 documented cases thus far) and the upcoming 2015 Hajj season, further surveillance is necessary to confirm the absence of MERS\u2010CoV transmission in the 2015 pilgrimage cohort. This is of utmost importance considering the severe overcrowding situations during these mass gatherings. In developing countries with limited resources for molecular diagnostics and a diverse spectrum of febrile aetiologies, early detection of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients will remain a challenge.",
