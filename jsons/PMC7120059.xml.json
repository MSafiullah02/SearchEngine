            "text": "Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a\nBetacoronavirus-1 in the lineage A (betacoronavirus A1) that was identified at the end of the last century [1]. ECoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus and is closely related to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), bovine coronavirus(BCoV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). ECoV was first isolated in North Carolina, USA, from the feces of a diarrheic foal in 1999 (ECoV-NC99) [2]. Multiple ECoV outbreaks have recently been reported in Japan [3, 4] and in the USA [5]. Major clinical signs observed were anorexia, fever, lethargy, leukopenia, and diarrhea, and unspecific discrete symptoms that do not lend to rapid diagnosis. ECoV was mainly detected in fecal samples from horses and less frequently in respiratory secretions [5\u20137]. A small number of animals with signs of encephalopathic disease have also been observed during these outbreaks [8].",

A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a non- PCR-based nucleic acid amplification assay, has been recently developed for the detection of ECoV in fecal samples [10]. ECoV was also identified by molecular methods in feces and respiratory samples of foals with and without enteric disease [2, 11, 12]. Real-time RT-PCR assays can enable a prompt identification of ECoV in respiratory and fecal samples of horses who were at the early stage of disease onset [5, 6].",

(a) Amplification plot of normalized fluorescence intensity versus number of PCR cycles. The X-axis represents the cycle number of the quantitative \u201cM qRT-PCR\u201d assay and the Y-axis, the normalized fluorescence intensity. (b) Standard curve for quantitative analysis of ECoV. The threshold cycle (Ct) is the number of PCR cycles requires for the fluorescent intensity of the reaction to predefine the threshold. The Ct is inversely proportional to the concentration of the input target (from 3 \u00d7 1010 to 3 \u00d7 105 copy per ml). A linear quantitative detection range with a correlation coefficient (R\n2) of 0.997 was obtained with an efficiency of 63 %",
