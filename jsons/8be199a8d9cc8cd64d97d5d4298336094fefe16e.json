These technologies have been used in vaccine research, which can be summarized using the term \"vaccinomics.\" These omics technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics analysis form the core of \"systems vaccinology.\" Omics technologies provide powerful methods in vaccine target identification. The genomics-based reverse vaccinology starts with predicting vaccine protein candidates through in silico bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences. The VIOLIN Vaxign vaccine design program (http://www.violinet.org/vaxign) is the first web-based vaccine target prediction software based on the reverse vaccinology strategy. Systematic transcriptomics and proteomics analyses facilitate rational vaccine target identification by detesting genome-wide gene expression profiles. Immunomics is the study of the set of antigens recognized by host immune systems and has also been used for efficient vaccine target prediction. With the large amount of omics data available, it is necessary to integrate various vaccine data using ontologies, including the Gene Ontology (GO) and Vaccine Ontology (VO), for more efficient vaccine target prediction and assessment. All these omics technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics analysis methods for a systems biology-based vaccine target prediction strategy.

Infectious diseases are a major source of mortality, contributing to 26% of global human mortality in 2001 [Becker et al., 2006] . Cancer, allergy, and autoimmune diseases also cause significant mortality and morbidity in human and animal victims. Vaccine immunization induces strong host immune responses to the administrated antigen and provides a long-term protection against a disease. However, an effective and safe vaccine for many deadly diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria, still does not exist. New approaches toward efficient vaccine target identification and vaccine development are desired.",

With the availability of large amounts of genome sequences, high-throughput-omics technologies-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunomics, and other omics approaches-have been invented. Advance bioinformatics approaches have also been developed to support the analysis of large amounts of omics data at differing levels, ranging from gene annotation, data normalization, significant gene expression detection, function enrichment, to pathway analysis. These omic and bioinformatic technologies enable the testing and screening of millions of possible vaccine candidates and vaccine-induced host immune targets in real time.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is an emerging and revolutionary vaccine development approach that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences. Predicted proteins are selected based on desirable attributes. Reverse vaccinology was first applied to the development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults [Pizza et al., 2000] . The complete MenB genome was screened using bioinformatics algorithms for open reading frames coding for putative surfaceexposed or secreted proteins, which are susceptible to antibody recognition and therefore the most suitable vaccine candidates. Out of approximately 600 novel vaccine candidates, 350 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and 28 were found to elicit protective antibody response. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered over the previous 40 years by conventional methods [Pizza et al., 2000] . Derived from the first reverse vaccinology attempt, Bexsero, a multicomponent, broadcoverage MenB vaccine, was developed. Following the generation of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data on Bexsero, Novartis submitted a Marketing Authorization Application in late 2010 to the European Medicines Agency for the use of Bexsero in humans [Althoff and Gassenbach, 2010] . This milestone occurred approximately 10 years after the first reverse vaccinology publication, representing a huge success in vaccine research and development (R&D).",

            "text": "Besides identifying secreted or outer membrane proteins, many more reverse vaccinology criteria have been developed since its first application report in 2000 described above. For example, when an outer membrane protein contains more than one transmembrane helix, the recombinant protein is often difficult to clone and purify [Pizza et al., 2000] . Therefore, the number of transmembrane domains of a protein can be used as a filtering criterion. Another criterion is the selection of bacterial adhesins that are responsible for adherence, colonization, and invasion of microbes to host cells [Sachdeva et al., 2005] . With the availability of multiple genomes sequenced for pathogens, it is also possible to run comparative genomics analyses to identify vaccine targets shared by many pathogenic organisms. These conserved proteins can be used to induce protection against multiple pathogenic strains. It is also important to compare sequence similarities between vaccine protein candidates and host proteome. A pathogen protein homologous to a host protein may induce an autoimmune disease or immune tolerance. The traditional immunoinformatics approaches for prediction immune epitopes can also be used for screening protective antigens [He et al., 2010b] .",

DNA microarrays can be hybridized with complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from messenger RNA isolated from microorganisms grown in vitro or in vivo under different growth conditions. RNA-seq, also called \"Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing,\" is a technique that uses high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA contents. The next-generation sequencing has deep coverage and base-level resolution and does not require the prior knowledge of the genome sequence [Pinto et al., 2011] . The genes that are differentially transcribed in response to alternation in environmental variables in wild type or gene mutant microbes can be measured. It is important to find out what genes are expressed during host infection. Those genes that are expressed during disease represent most likely protective vaccine targets.",

            "text": "One challenge in vaccine target identification is the difficulty in experimental verification. The gold standard in vaccine target validation is a vaccinationchallenge experiment, which tests if a vaccine immunization is able to induce protection against challenge of an infection with virulent pathogen in vivo. However, such experiments are often expensive and difficult to perform, especially for deadly pathogens (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that do not have ideal small animal models that mimic human pathogenesis mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to identify an immune response that correlates well with protection. For many diseases, an ideal immune response that correlates with protection has not been found. Omics approaches can be used to identify host gene signatures that correlate and even predict protective immunity. For example, to identify early gene signatures induced in humans vaccinated with the attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D, two studies have examined total peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from human volunteers at different time points following vaccination with YF17D [Gaucher et al., 2008; Querec et al., 2009] . Microarrays were used to determine early effects (3 and 7 days postvaccination) of the vaccination on gene expression. A group of transcription factors, including IRF7, STAT2, and ETS2, functions as key regulators of the early immune response to YF17D vaccination [Gaucher et al., 2008] . A list of gene signatures (e.g., EIF2AK4 and TNFRSF17), which correlate with the magnitude of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses and antibody titers, has also been identified and verified [Querec et al., 2009] . These gene signature profiles may serve as correlates of protection and be used in high-throughput screening of vaccine targets.",

These vaccines are targeted for over 20 animal species (e.g., human, cattle, and fish) against over 100 pathogens. Each vaccine is classified in VO using a logically defined, structured ontological hierarchy. As a vaccine knowledge base, VO also stores terms related to other vaccine-associated information, including different vaccine components (e.g., protective antigens and vaccine adjuvants) and vaccine-induced immune responses. Semantic relations between these terms are also included in VO to represent existing knowledge. These representations, written in the Web Ontology Language, can be parseable and readable by computer programs. VO has been used to model the meta-analysis of vaccine protection investigation [Brinkman et al., 2010; Todd et al., 2012] . VO can also be used to improve the indexing and literature mining of vaccine articles for analysis of Brucella gene-vaccine interaction networks [Xiang and He, 2009b; Hur et al., 2010] and discovery of IFN-g and vaccine-associated gene networks [Ozgur et al., 2010] .

For example, analysis of manually curated vaccine target data available in existing databases provides a powerful way for vaccine target prediction. As part of the VIOLIN vaccine database and analysis system [Xiang et al., 2008] , Protegen is a webbased database that contains over 600 protective antigen information [Yang et al., 2011] . These antigens are also collected in the VO. Protective antigens are targeted by host acquired immunity and able to induce protection against infectious diseases. To identify features enriched in protective protein antigens, 201 protective protein antigens from Gram-negative bacteria and 69 protective protein antigens from Gram-positive bacteria collected in Protegen were analyzed [He and Xiang, 2012] . Of the protective antigens in Grampositive bacteria, 64% are extracellular or cell wall proteins and 48% of protective antigens in Gram-negative bacteria belong to extracellular or outer membrane proteins. Over 40% protective bacterial antigens are adhesins or adhesin-like proteins. Many conserved motifs, including Autotransporter and TonB domains, are enriched in protective bacterial antigens. A predictive method based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm has a performance of 92% true positive rate of sequence-based protection. However, this SVMbased method has poor performance in differentiating true negative from false negative results [He and Xiang, 2012] . Overall, this study is pioneer in identifying specific patterns in protective antigens and computationally predicting protective antigens.",
