Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables with a non-normal distribution, and the Fisher exact test to compare proportions. We further analyzed the risk factors associated with poor outcome by means of a logistic regression model that included those variables found to be statistically significant at the univariate level or those deemed clinically relevant. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Seventeen independent variables were initially selected based on clinical judgment and published literature. Prior to model fitting, cluster analysis was used to reduce the number of candidate variables. Backward selection with a type I error rate of 0.05 was used to reach a final reduced model containing three predictor variables. Discrimination of the final model was quantified via a C Index (ROC area). All statistical tests were 2-tailed and the threshold of statistical significance was p < 0.05.

No statistically significant differences between active smokers (18.8% in the good outcome group vs. 26.2% in the poor outcome group) or ex-smokers (23.4% in the good outcome group vs. 23.8% in the poor outcome group) were observed. In the favorable outcome group, 181 of the cases (95.3%) presented complete recovery of the episode and nine patients (4.7%) presented sequelae, while in the poor outcome group only 25 of the cases (59.5%) presented complete recovery and five cases (11.9%) presented sequelae. Twelve patients died during hospitalization. Thirty-day related mortality was 0.5% in the good outcome group vs. 23.8% in the poor outcome group (p < 0.0001).",

This wide range of indications, although similar to other series, precludes a correct assessment of steroid therapy as a poor prognostic factor. The potential benefit of steroid therapy in patients with influenza virus infection with risk factors for poor outcome should be further studied.",

Since a complete blood count is an easily accessible test, we believe that it should be the cornerstone in the screening of a possible underlying HPS secondary to influenza virus infection. If severe cytopenias were observed, we consider that a systematic determination of ferritin, triglycerides and fibrinogen levels would be beneficial. In the case of abnormal levels of any of these three HPS markers, determination of NK cell activity and soluble IL-2 receptor concentration should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.",
