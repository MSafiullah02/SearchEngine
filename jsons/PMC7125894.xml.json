Empirical studies have provided some theoretical foundations for psychobehavioral responses during past outbreaks of respiratory infections (Leppin and Aro, 2009). Psychobehavioral responses during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks showed a positive association between anxiety level and personal protective behaviors (Seto et al., 2003, Leung et al., 2005). Behavioral responses to an outbreak were also found to be influenced by public perceptions of risk and severity (Lau et al., 2007, Leppin and Aro, 2009) and reported cases of infection (Leung et al., 2005).",

The first death was reported 2 weeks after the commencement of this study, and increased steadily to a peak of 40 deaths in week 6, before a rapid decline. The local media intensely covered the official number of deaths related to 2009 H1N1 influenza released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia during this period. There were increases in all types of fears and avoidance behaviors from week 4 onwards, in concordance with the escalating number of reported deaths, before declining after the peak deaths reported in week 6 (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2). This was particularly noticeable in those expressing fear of visiting hospitals and fear of eating out. Similar trends were observed during the SARS outbreak, whereby anxiety levels closely mirrored the daily number of new cases and were strongly associated with the intensity of the outbreak (Leung et al., 2005).",

The health protective behaviors of covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands regularly, and adopting healthy lifestyles appeared consistently high from week 2 to week 6 of the survey (Fig. 1.3). Declining trends were observed in the latter two as the number of deaths decreased after week 6. The apparent reduction in some avoidance behaviors as the number of deaths declined may indicate a decrease in risk perception, with consequent decline in the adoption of preventive measures (Lau et al., 2007, Leppin and Aro, 2009). The proportions wearing masks, staying at home and taking preventive medicine increased with the number of reported deaths, and despite a decline after the peak weekly deaths, remained at a higher level at the end of the study when compared to the beginning. Our data indicate that reported deaths due to the H1N1 influenza pandemic influenced public's health-protective behaviors. As such, health authorities and media should stress to the public to continuously adopt healthy behaviors to prevent infection even if the number of reported deaths decreases.",
