As a consequence of the 1952 Copenhagen poliomyelitis epidemic [3, 4] , hospitals started to create the first areas specifically designed and adapted to provide intense support for failing organ systems. The introduction of this new branch of medical science (both physiological and technological), quickly required the development of a new setting for these skills, and the subsequent creation of a designated area in the hospital, known today as the intensive care unit (ICU). Subsequent to this, many different individuals, including Vladimir Negovsky, Peter Safar, Max Harry Weil amongst others, created the science of reanimatology [5, 6] . These pioneers, together with subsequent generations of clinicians and nurses, have continued to develop new knowledge and skills as well as the technology required to transform this diverse series of competencies into an integrated package of care, now known as the art and science of intensive care medicine [7] .",

This concentration enables optimal care and management of patients to be provided. There is reasonable evidence now that demonstrates that the care of critically ill patients by intensivists and critical care trained nurses can improve many patient related out-comes as well as using the available resources more efficiently. These improved outcomes include a reduced rate of nosocomial infections, decreased complications, reduced length of ICU stays, and decreased mortality. If these resources are not concentrated, rather spread evenly throughout the hospital, with a couple of beds on each ward, then this 'improvement by quantity' is reduced with a less efficient use of resources and a decreased level of care being delivered to the patients.",

The location chosen for the ICU, however, commonly reflects the need for geographic proximity to the more acute areas, such as the emergency department and operating rooms. In addition, there needs to be some thought towards colocation with diagnostic facilities such as the availability of a computed tomography (CT) scanner and the availability of a 24-hour seven-day-a-week functioning laboratory. Most ICUs today have facilities and equipment located within the unit to perform the immediate analysis of arterial blood gas samples and some basic biochemistry and hematology tests. Since most situations in intensive care medicine are critically time-dependent, the successful provision of care is reliant on good relationships and communication between the ICU and the other services and departments of the hospital. This is also required to optimize the timing of admission and discharge of patients to, and from, the ICU.",

A higher level of vigilance of recently discharged patients is necessary to identify and prevent any subsequent deterioration early. Failure to do so can compromise the patient and reverse any benefits that the ICU initially provided [9, 10] . Another risk to the recovering intensive care patient is inappropriate early discharge to the ward, due to lack of beds or time constraints [11] , and although this is controversial [12, 13] , it has been demonstrated that there is scope for improvement [14] . This need for an effective interface between the ICU and the other departments of the hospital has not only physical and architectural implications: it also has a crucial impact on human resource factors, both outside and inside the ICU. These include stress management, professionalism in facing and coping with rotating working patterns [15] , and fatigue [16, 17] .",

These professionals are also more and more involved in the management of unstable patients outside the ICU [18 -21] in a movement called by Ken Hillman \"critical care without walls\" [21] . In the United States, the situation is slightly different, with a significant number of ICUs still using the so-called open model [22] . In this system, care and therapy are often supervised by nurses and younger physicians (with occasional mandatory or optional consultation with an intensive care professional), but under the direction and orientation of a primary physician, paradoxically a system that the literature suggests provides less effective care [23] .",

The obvious implication of this is that it is vital to ensure that capacity is reserved for only those most likely to benefit from it. There is, therefore, a significant responsibility for the intensivist to triage patients appropriately so that those most likely to benefit are admitted, and those less likely to, are not. Often, however, the situation is more complex. ICU is but one part of the patient journey that takes in many differing parts of the hospital together with multiple professional consultations and interventions. ICU admission criteria must, therefore, be able to cope with not just the sick emergency patient but often also the elective patient whose admission has been planned even before hospital admission.",

Usually, several objective and subjective factors -both ICU related and patient-related -have an impact on this decision, such as the number of beds available, the admission diagnosis, the severity of illness, age and operative status [25] .

According to consensus definitions, a discharge decision should be taken \"when a patient's physiologic status has stabilized and the need for ICU monitoring and care is no longer necessary\" [26] . However, this issue is more complex than it seems at first glance. Since the 1980s, many published outcome studies have presented data on vital status at ICU discharge and also at hospital discharge. Consequently, it has become clear that a significant number of patients either deteriorated or died following ICU discharge but before leaving the hospital (the so-called post-ICU mortality or occult mortality). Several published studies have raised attention to the magnitude of this phenomenon, which can be as high as 36.7 % of all deaths [40] . Some patients deteriorate and then need to be re-admitted to the ICU often soon after ICU discharge [41 -44] , again a common phenomenon carrying a large associated mortality [45] .",

In the early 2000s, it was estimated that intensive care beds represented 13.4 % of all hospital beds in the USA, costing upwards of $55.5 billion, accounting for 13.3 % of all hospital costs and 0.56 % of the gross domestic product (GDP). In the last few years, the panorama has changed [46] , with the number of intensive care beds, days (as a percentage of the total hospital days) and occupancy rates continuing to increase. Also, the costs per day of intensive care medicine have increased by 30.4 % with a corresponding increase in the annual costs associated with this specialty of 44.2 %; in 2005, this represented 13.4 % of hospital costs, 4.1 % of national health expenditure, and 0.66 % of the GDP, If we add to this number other costs incurred by caring for patients with critical illness the overall number accounts for 1 % of the GDP in the USA. In Europe, despite the fact that the heterogeneity is much greater across countries [47] or even inside the same country [48] , the mean costs per intensive care bed per year could be as low as 30,990 euro or as high as between 225,000 to 471,330 euro in the UK (depending on the level of care) [48] , similar to those in Germany [49] . Despite the fact that these numbers are consistently lower than the numbers presented in the USA, pressure on the economy remains an issue.",

            "text": "This panorama is likely to change, due to the increasing age of the population, with the increasing prevalence of comorbid diseases, together with significant advances in medical science. These factors when combined result in the application of more complex and costly procedures to an increasing fragile population, in which complications will have greater consequences due to the increasingly narrow cost-effective margin of a significant number of interventions. As a direct consequence of these changes, there has been a shift from the almost exclusive presentation in medical conferences and medical journals of new devices and drugs to an increasing discussion of topics that 15 years ago would not have been accepted in a large major conference, or would rarely have been heard. Examples are the increasing efforts put on patient safety [50 -52] , detection and prevention of adverse events [53 -56] , and cultural changes regarding patient safety and error management [57 -61] . A major example of these changes in priorities and culture was the signature by more than 80 Scientific Societies, industry representatives and patient representatives of the Declaration of Vienna, during the last Annual Congress of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, a public call for attention and action to these issues [51] . This declaration was just a first step in an ongoing-process that includes the public presentation of a revised version of the structural norms for European ICUs [62] and the revision of mandatory indicators for ICU evaluation. Benchmarking and other methods of comparative evaluation of the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of ICUs will have a growing impact in the decisions made by purchasers of intensive care [63, 64] In the future, maximization of the volume-outcome relationship will certainly lead to the fusion (or the closure) of small ICUs [65 -69] and to the re-arrangement of existing ICUs and services into large networks, trained and evaluated for organizational performance and not just for clinical performance [70] . New drugs and devices will be subjected to ever greater scrutiny before utilization, with the quality of the trials in which they proved their efficacy (and cost-efficacy) being more highly scrutinized for adverse events than previously, and clearly separating practice guidelines and clinical orientations from industry campaigns [71, 72] . We will certainly have new tools and devices, new drugs and interventions [73] , but we cannot just sit and wait for a magic bullet to appear, we must be proactive in applying existing (and new) interventions to decrease mortality [74] , which translate evidence into practice [75] .",
