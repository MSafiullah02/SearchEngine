            "text": "Since emerging from Wuhan, China in late 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , has infected over 3.2 million individuals worldwide and nearly 1 million in the United States (as of 04/29/2020). 1, 2 Despite the institution of measures designed to \"flatten the curve\", COVID-19 has claimed the lives of > 225,000 individuals worldwide and > 60,000 individuals in the United States alone (as of 04/29/2020). 2 Of note, mortality estimates in some of the hardest hit regions have already or may need to be revised to account for a spike in sudden deaths occurring at home. 3, 4 Although most of these deaths are likely directly attributable to COVID-19 (e.g. pulseless electrical activity/respiratory arrests), many of the same regions within the United States have also seen the outpatient prescription volume of COVID-19-direct, heart-corrected QT interval prolonging drug(s), specifically hydroxychloroquine, rise by as much as 22,700% compared to the same time period (03/15-31) in 2019. 5 Importantly, recent studies have shown that between 11% and 25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had QTc values rise above the critical 500 ms threshold. 6, 7 As a result, a substantial number of COVID-19 patients, prescribed these so-called \"corona cocktails\", may be at increased risk of developing drug-induced long QT syndrome (DI-LQTS) which could deteriorate into drug-induced torsades de pointes (DI-TdP), or worse, druginduced sudden cardiac death (DI-SCD). 8, 9 Therefore, it stands to reason that the same phenomenon (DI-LQTS/DI-TdP) that has already halted one chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine clinical trial 7 and led the Food and Drug Administration to caution against the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital setting/clinical trial 10 could also be contributing, at least in small part, to the increase in sudden deaths observed in some COVID-19",

[13] [14] [15] [16] Given the potential of p.Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A to exacerbate outcome-related health disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic, this review was assembled to raise awareness of the multiple mechanism(s) whereby the pro-arrhythmic p.Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A common variant may increase risk for VA/SCD amongst those of African descent as well as the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors for mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

[21] [22] [23] Of note, in an adjusted Cox regression model, the mortality risk associated with elevated cardiac biomarkers/acute cardiac injury was more significant than age and high-risk co-morbid conditions such as chronic obstructive/fibrotic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and a pre-existing history of cardiovascular disease. 23, 24 In addition, life-threatening VAs (e.g. ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation) have been documented in ~6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and appear to be driven by underlying myocardial injury. 25 Proposed mechanisms of acute myocardial injury and resulting VA risk in patients with COVID-19 include i) direct SARS-CoV-2 myocardial infection (e.g. myocarditis), ii) myocardial stress induced by hypoxemic respiratory failure, and/or iii) an exaggerated immune response that results in high levels of circulating cytokines [i.e. interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, etc.] directly injuring cardiomyocytes (Figure 1) . [25] [26] [27] Notably, IL-6 may prolong the ventricular action potential via modulation of cardiac ion channel expression/function. 27 Under normal physiological circumstances, Na v 1.5 cardiac sodium channels conduct tiny amount of persistent/late sodium current that contributes minimally to the maintenance of the action potential plateau (i.e. \u2264 0.5% of peak I Na ). 28 However, in the setting of hypoxia, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and LQT3-causative SCN5A gain-of-function variants, the relative contribution of late sodium current can increase up to ten-fold to 4%-5% of peak I Na . 16, 20, 28, 29 In turn, this \"pathologic\" late sodium current can prolong ventricular action potential duration (APD) and predispose to VA/SCD.",

As succinctly outlined in recent work by Lazzerini et al 27 , the exaggerated immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically elevation of IL-6, likely increases arrhythmia risk via i) modulation of cardiac ion channel expression/function leading to APD prolongation (e.g. direct IL-6-mediated blockade of hERG/K v 11.1 potassium channels), ii) cardiac sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and iii) inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of some QTc-prolonging drugs (e.g. IL-6 and CYP3A4; Figure 1 ). The latter effect of IL-6 is particularly important given that a number of COVID-19 pharmacotherapies (e.g. hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir) under investigation and/or in use clinically are known to prolong the QTc and pre-dispose to DI-TdP/DI-SCD ( Table 2) . 8, 30 Taken together, these data suggest that 1 in 13 African Americans may be at substantially increased risk for potentially lethal VAs, most notably DI-TdP, during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the perfect storm of i) intrinsic genetic-susceptibility (i.e. p.Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A), ii) modifiable environmental risk factors (e.g. electrolyte abnormalities and concurrent QTcprolonging drug use), and iii) COVID-19-specific risk factors (e.g. profound hypoxemia and cytokine storm; Figure 1 ). Whether population-specific genetic risk factors such as p.Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A are contributing to the spike in sudden deaths and racial health disparities observed in COVID-19 epicenters remains to be proven and given the lack of banked DNA in these epicenters, this speculation may not even be testable.",
