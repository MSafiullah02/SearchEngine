A fundamental class of nonequilibrium phenomena is the absorbing-state phase transition (APT) [1,2,4] that occurs when the system has accessible states where the dynamics remains permanently stuck, strongly violating detailed balance and thus implying the absence of equilibrium counterparts. One of the characteristic features of APTs is the interplay between the propagation and annihilation of particles that can represent hosts for an infectious disease, microorganisms, molecules in catalytic reactions, etc. When the ratio between propagation and annihilation is below a threshold, the density \u03c1 of active particles vanishes and an APT takes place.",

From the epidemiological viewpoint, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model is canonical [7]. In SIS, the cure is the same as in CP, but the infection is transmitted at a rate \u03bb to each healthy neighbor of an infected vertex, while in CP the infection rate is divided by the vertex degree. On lattices, SIS and the CP have the same critical behavior belonging to the directed percolation (DP) universality class [4]. However, the nature of the phase transition of these models are different on complex networks with power-law (PL) degree distributions given by P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3, where P(k) is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of the network connects to other k vertices. While CP exhibits a transition at a finite threshold that involves the collective activation of the entire network [8], the transition of the SIS model occurs at a threshold that goes to zero in the thermodynamical limit and is triggered by the mutual reactivation of hubs (vertices with very large degree) [8,9].",

Even for simple dynamical processes most of the exact results are bounds [11] and analytical approximations based on mean-field theories are generically used to quantitatively predict the behavior of such processes on networks [10,11]. Dynamical correlations play an important role irrespective of the infinite dimensionality of networks [30\u201332] and mean-field theories are approximations that call for complementary analysis based on computer simulations. For example, the existence of localized epidemic phases [17,18,33,34] and the slow subcritical dynamics due to rare (locally supercritical) regions [20,33,35,36] on networks with PL degree distribution have recently been discussed, grounded on simulations. Notice that localization is related to metastability at subcritical phases [35] and can play an important role in the quasistationarity of the dynamical process.",

Moreover, standard dynamic methods for simulations of APTs as, e.g., spreading or decay simulations [4], are not effective in complex networks due to the small-world property [29] that makes the dynamics to probe the network finiteness very quickly. An alternative is to consider the so-called quasistationary (QS) state where the original dynamics is perturbed to skip the absorbing state in a such way that this perturbation becomes irrelevant in the infinite-size limit for all intensive quantities of interest and a finite-size scaling (FSS) technique provides the correct thermodynamical limit as well as the critical exponents associated with the APT [1,4].",

We permit states with n=0 being visited but it returns to the previous active state with rate 1. The source term in Eq. (2) becomes F=(\u03b41,n\u2212\u03b40,n)P0*. The QS distribution is given by\n(7)P\u00afn=limt\u2192\u221ePn*.For n=0, Eq. (2) simplifies to\n(8)dP0*dt=P1*\u2212P0*.In the QS regime we have P\u00af1=P\u00af0. To calculate the time between two visits to the absorbing state, the epidemic lifespan, consider a discrete dynamics of time step \u03c40=1, the mean time that the system lasts in the absorbing state. The system is or is not in a state n=0 with probabilities P\u00af0 and 1\u2212P\u00af0, respectively. If the system is active in step s=0, the probability that it stays active for s steps corresponds to stay in a state n>0 for s\u22121 steps and returns to n=0 at step s, which is given by Qs=(1\u2212P\u00af0)s\u22121P\u00af0.

Notice that this time differs from that of the SQS method since it is the average time to visit the absorbing state starting from a single infected vertex and not from an arbitrary QS state, as discussed in Sec. II A. Thus its scaling properties are different. Lets us consider a spreading process on a lattice of dimension d. The probability that the dynamics is active at time t starting with a single infected vertex is Ps and, at the critical point, this quantity scales as Ps\u223ct\u2212\u03b4exp(\u2212t/ts)\n[4] where the finite size of the lattice is probed at a characteristic time ts\u223cNz*\n[4], being N=Ld the number of sites33It is more convenient to consider the number of sites rather than the system length since we aim at networks. of the lattice of length L. So, the average time between two visits to the absorbing state is given by\n(10)\u03c4a=\u222b0\u221etdP0dtdt=\u222b0\u221ePsdt\u223cNz*(1\u2212\u03b4)for d smaller than the upper critical dimension dc=4 for which \u03b4<1\n[4]. The last integral is obtained with Eq. (4) and an integration by parts and was evaluated using the saddle-point method. Above the upper critical dimension, corresponding to the mean-field level that we are mainly interested in, we have \u03b4=1 and ts\u223cN1/2\n[47,48]. Evaluating the integral for \u03b4=1, we find \u03c4a increasing logarithmically with the system size.",

Infected vertices spread activity through the network by direct susceptible contacts. An infected vertex i transmits the infection to each of its susceptible nearest neighbors with a rate \u03bb/ki, in which \u03bb is the control parameter. In turn, infected vertices become spontaneously susceptible with rate 1 fixing the time unit. In SIS model, the infection rate is \u03bb for each edge connecting infected and susceptible vertices irrespective of their degrees while the healing process is the same of CP. So, one can easily realize that the state \u03c3i=0 for all vertices is absorbing in both models. The limit between persistence and extinction of activity is delimited by a critical value \u03bbc of the control parameter.

Note that for all curves shown, \u03c4a diverges approximately at the same position \u03bbp where the peaks of the susceptibility \u03c7 curves are located. Using the lifespan \u03c4a as an order parameter is not possible due to its divergence in the active phase. Hence, we consider the integrated autocorrelation time in the next subsection.

In RBC, the probability of returning to the absorbing configuration in the next step after the epidemic is restarted is pabs=1/(1+\u03bbck), where k is the degree of the vertex where the activity ended and returned subsequently. Since the pre-absorbing state will, with large probability, be in a vertex of low degree, which represents the great majority of vertices in the network, and remembering that \u03bbc(N)\u21920 as N\u2192\u221e, the probability that the system falls back into the absorbing state in the next step goes to 1. In the HR method, the particle returns to a vertex of degree k=kc\u223cmin[N1/2,N1/(\u03b3\u22121)] such that \u03bbc(N)k\u226b1 and the probability to produce an outbreak with n>1 infected vertices goes to 1. So this qualitatively explain why HR is similar to SQS rather than RBC since the long-term regime of SQS is constituted by a large number of configurations with n\u226b1, many of them neighboring the hubs and increasing the chance of their reactivation. Note that in the CP dynamics, the system returns to the absorbing state with probability pabs=1/(1+\u03bbc)<1/2 irrespective of the vertex degree and a new outbreak with n>1 has a finite probability to happen in both RBC and HR. The autocorrelation is insensitive to this detail and provides the same FSS scaling exponents for all methods.",

[18,36]. These outliers generate localized metastable patches that can be independently activated, manifested as multiple peaks in the susceptibility of the SIS model on large networks simulated with the SQS method [18,30,42,54]. Susceptibility curves comparing the different methods for the same network realization are shown in Fig. 8. A remarkable difference is that the peak observed at small \u03bb in SQS curves, which is due to the activity localized in the most connected vertex of the network [18,42], is not observed in the RBC but is in the HR method. The secondary peaks are associated to the lifespan divergence [18]. The SQS and HR methods are equivalent. The activation of the most connected vertex is not captured by RBC method but it is for the other two methods. A smearing of the transition [36,59,60] in SQS and HR methods is more evident than in the case \u03b3=2.7. As expected, above the epidemic threshold, the methods become equivalent since the absorbing state was never visited in the simulations. It is worth mentioning that the multiple transitions are not artifacts of the SQS simulations, and are also observed with the HR and RBC methods.\n",

In these approaches a perturbation of the original dynamics, which is negligible in the thermodynamical limit of the active phase, is introduced. We investigated distinct QS methods: The SQS has sampling constrained to active configurations; the RBC, where the dynamics returns to the configuration that it was immediately prior the visit to the absorbing state; the HR method, where the epidemic is restarted in one of the most connected vertices of the network; and a weak external field (WEF) that introduces spontaneous infection.
