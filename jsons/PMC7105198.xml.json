            "text": "Zoonotic diseases comprise a significant and increasing proportion of all emerging human infectious diseases, and most of them originate from wildlife (Kruse et al., 2004, Jones et al., 2008). Two mammalian orders, Rodentia (rodents) and Chiroptera (bats), represent the most relevant potential sources of new zoonoses (Calisher et al., 2006, Meerburg et al., 2009, Smith and Wang, 2013). The Rodentia is the single largest order of mammals. There are more than 2000 living species of rodents, which comprise \u223c40% of all mammalian species, including mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, voles, chinchillas, chipmunks, gophers, muskrats, gerbils, woodchucks, and many others (Huchon et al., 2002). Despite their great species diversity, all rodents share a common feature \u2013 a single pair of continuously growing incisors, which are used to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Rodents are native on all continents except Antarctica, and they show a wide range of lifestyles, ranging from terrestrial, subterranean, arboreal, to aquatic habitats (Wolff and Sherman, 2007).",

            "text": "Rodents are common hosts for pathogens that transmit diseases to humans and domestic animals because of their properties of close association with humans, large social group size, intense social interaction, high population density and widespread geographic distribution. Since the Middle Ages, rodents have been known to contribute to human diseases, as black rats were associated with the spread of the plague (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). However, rodents are also a threat to public health in modern times. They have been implicated as reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens, such as viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo, and Lassa) and hantaviruses (Hantaan, Dobrava, and Sin Nombre) (Enria and Pinheiro, 2000, Goeijenbier et al., 2013). Also, global climate change and continued urbanization have led to increased problems with rodent-associated zoonoses (Mills et al., 2010). Recent metagenomic studies have identified a wide diversity of novel viruses in rodents from families/genera that contain important human pathogens, including new species/variants of picornaviruses, hepaciviruses and sapoviruses (Firth et al., 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to enhance our knowledge of the virome diversity in rodents to facilitate future prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases.",

            "text": "Bats are the second most diverse mammalian orders on the earth, with more than 1200 living species identified worldwide (Altringham, 2011). The importance of bats as natural hosts for several important viral agents, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, has been established (Calisher et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2007, Ge et al., 2013, Smith and Wang, 2013, Munster et al., 2016). Due to the wide-scale microbial surveillance programs conducted and novel high-throughput detection methods developed in recent years, there are a plethora of newly identified viruses in both rodents and bats. Our group already constructed the first database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir) in 2014 (Chen et al., 2014). In this study, we present a newly established DRodVir database for a thorough and modern understanding of rodent-associated viral zoonoses (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/). Moreover, we used the information from two sister databases to perform a comparative analysis on the virome diversities of the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.",

            "text": "DRodVir is a sequence-centric database, since molecular methods are now commonly used in virus detection and functional analysis. To retrieve all available sequences of rodent-associated viruses from the public domain, we first performed exhaustive searches in both the PubMed and Nucleotide databases of NCBI using a group of keywords pertaining to rodents. Then, the retrieved GenBank records were downloaded to a local system and parsed by an in-house BioPerl script to generate human-readable tables of the metadata, including the sampling time, location, rodent species, specimen type (e.g., feces, blood, or tissues), and viral detection method (e.g., PCR or metagenomics), for further review. For published sequences, additional meta information was extracted from the related literature using manual curation. As the DRodVir database focuses on natural rodent-associated mammal viruses that are most relevant to emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, the following filter criteria are employed to exclude unrelated records: i) samples derived from animals other than rodents; ii) sequences of phages; iii) insect or plant viruses; iv) laboratory-cultured viruses in model rodents. Taxonomic information of all viruses and rodents was derived from the Taxonomy database of NCBI. In addition, we collected information concerning the viruses (e.g., genome architecture, average size and virus graphics) and the rodents (e.g., common names and known geographic ranges) from the ViralZone databases (Masson et al., 2013) and the ICUN Red List (www.iucnredlist.org), respectively. Moreover, the established phylogenetic relationships between different rodent families from a previous study were carefully incorporated into the database (Meredith et al., 2011).",

In addition, the \u2018browse by region\u2019 submenu allows the users to easily summarize the current research efforts conducted on rodent-associated viruses for any countries or continents (Fig. 1D). All three submenus are organized as hierarchical and expandable trees and can be easily switched on/off by single click on the title bar. Each branch of the trees in the submenus provides a direct link to individual tab in the main content panel, which presents a uniform sortable grid that includes brief information of the viruses, specimens, associated rodents, determined sequences and related literature (Fig. 1A). Each line of the table can be further expanded by double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, GenBank accession number(s), sequence submission date, submitters and their affiliations. A clickable linear map is available for each full-length viral sequence to highlight the genome architecture of the virus (Fig. 1A). For brevity, the table provides up to 100 records by default. Handy toolbar is available for users to page up/down if more records exist, or alternatively, turn off paging to force to display all records within a single table.

The text search engine allows the extraction of virus/rodent/specimen/sequence information from the database using either a simple query for a quick start or combined search patterns for advanced usages. The search results are organized into an individual high-performance grid in the content panel as aforementioned. To facilitate online data analysis, two visualization tools are integrated into the result table: i) a statistical pie chart is available with a single click on the column title of virus family, rodent species/family, sample type and sampling country (Fig. 2B); ii) a global map with indicative markers is provided for the column of sampling country to better illustrate the geographic distribution of the rodent-associated viruses (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/DRodVir/main.cgi?func=map). In addition, the result table and the related sequences can be easily downloaded as Excel and FASTA files respectively for further offline analyses. To bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists, the information concerning the rodents including common names, known distribution and phylogenetic relationships of rodents is also available and searchable in the DRodVir database (Fig. 2C). The BLAST sequence similarity search form enables the users to submit their own sequences for homology comparison among all known rodent-associated viruses. Moreover, an automatic pipeline for multiple sequence alignment and online phylogenetic tree construction is offered to facilitate follow-up sequence analysis. Detailed step-by-step instruction of all aforementioned usages of the DRodVir database is available in the online help page (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/howto.htm).",

Given that there is nearly twice the number of living rodent species as bat species, the current investigation efforts cover only \u223c9% of the rodent species but \u223c21% of the bat species.

Therefore, a better understanding of the virome diversity in either host requires the investigation efforts to cover as many countries as possible. Indeed, the current studies already include countries from all six continents. Thus far, the coverage of countries in most continents is far from comprehensive (Fig. 3C). Although the species diversity of rodents/bats in different countries is different and the current efforts in most countries could not cover all resident host species, further investigations dedicated to those unexplored regions of each continent are essential for our understanding of virome diversity in both rodents and bats.",

This could be a reflection of particular public concerns on some well-known zoonotic viruses carried by rodents or bats. For example, \u223c52% of the rodent-associated viruses currently identified were from family Bunyaviridae (mostly are Hantaviruses), whereas \u223c41% of the bat-associated viruses reported so far were from family Rhabdoviridae (mostly are Lyssaviruses). Nevertheless, the biased data may also be a helpful measure for the potential distribution range of each viral family in the hosts. For instance, viruses from the family Bunyaviridae are the most widely distributed viruses among rodent-associated viruses, which have been detected in 109 rodent species from 64 countries worldwide (Fig. 3B). However, although the current data of viruses from the family Coronaviridae (i.e., coronavirus) in bats are less than half of those from family Rhabdoviridae, coronaviruses were surprisingly identified in 121 bat species from 39 countries, which makes them the most widely distributed bat-associated viruses thus far (Fig. 3B). Because the causative agents of both SARS and MERS pandemics are coronaviruses, their widespread occurrence in bats further highlights their potential threats to public health. Also, the current data show that viruses from some other families such as Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Arenaviridae, and Picornaviridae are broadly distributed in terms of host species (rodents and/or bats) and geography (Fig. 3B). Therefore, these viral families should be the hotspots for future studies dedicated to the prevention and control of zoonotic viral diseases.",
