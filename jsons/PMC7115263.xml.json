When double gloves were worn with PPE and the inner glove was removed last, significantly fewer participants transferred virus to their hands, and significantly fewer viruses were transferred to participants\u2019 hands compared to when single gloves were worn and removed first. The difference in virus transfer to the inner glove and hands from double-gloving suggests that the inner gloves receive much of the virus transferred from contaminated PPE items, reducing the amount reaching the surface of the hands. The finding that viruses on PPE transfer to hands is consistent with previous studies using model viruses11 and fluorescent tracers.15 This transfer poses an increased risk of self-inoculation, environmental contamination, or transfer of virus to others if an HCW touches his or her face, surfaces, objects, or other patients without first performing hand hygiene.",

However, observations of participants\u2019 actions in this simulation of PPE use and removal suggest that a multistep removal protocol might not be an optimal approach. Although the participants in this study were given an opportunity to read the CDC PPE removal protocol poster and ask questions, and the poster was in front of them at all times for reference, most participants still made some type of error during removal. These errors, including handing PPE by touching the front areas (eg, handling N95 respirator by the front instead of the straps), are targeted by the CDC protocol because they are likely to result in hand contamination. In practice, HCWs are unlikely to have the protocol in front of them each time they need to remove PPE. Achieving adherence to the protocol may require multiple educational messages and feedback techniques targeting each item of PPE, making it a complex undertaking and not necessarily an efficient use of resources if some elements of the protocol are not actually protective.",

For example, the significant difference in contamination levels observed for gown removal suggests that this may be a high-risk point in the PPE removal process. The gown has a large surface area for contamination to spread across, as well as a large surface area for which the wearer to accidentally come in contact with during removal. Observations of participants making gown removal errors showed a tendency for the participant to remove the gown in a manner typical of the way in which one would remove a piece of clothing worn on the torso, rather than by grabbing the neckline and pulling it off inside out. These findings suggest that gown removal could be targeted as a high-risk point in PPE removal. This point could be addressed using messages targeting one specific action (eg, always grab the gown by the neck), rather than multiple steps, all of which might not have protective effects.",

Double-gloving has some drawbacks, including greater cost due to the use of twice as many gloves, the extra time required to don extra gloves, and issues with HCWs\u2019 perception of impaired sensitivity and dexterity during double-gloving.16, 17 An alternative targeted measure might be to encourage HCWs to double-glove during certain high-risk situations that are likely to result in heavily contaminated PPE, such as droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures like intubation that require gowns and respirators and have previously been observed to carry infection risks.4\n",

According to the CDC protocol, hand hygiene should immediately follow each incidence of PPE removal. Little data are available on hand hygiene compliance specifically after removal of PPE. No study has found that glove use reduces hand hygiene compliance compared with situations in which gloves are not worn,18 but research has shown that HCWs\u2019 general hand hygiene compliance is suboptimal. One multicenter study found a compliance rate of 36% in non-ICU settings, which increased to only 50% after intervention19; another study found a rate of 32% before interventions designed to increase compliance, increasing to 63% after these interventions.20 The risk of hand contamination during PPE removal underscores the crucial need to reinforce messages about the importance of hand hygiene when PPE is worn. Analyses of factors that contribute to the success of hand hygiene interventions suggest that incorporating \u201cvicarious experience\u201d and \u201cintroduction of experiential elements\u201d as part of educational efforts can improve compliance.21 Simulations such as the one used in the present study demonstrate how these types of virus transfers can occur during real-world use.

            "text": "Transfer of virus to the scrubs worn beneath PPE occurred at similarly high frequencies during both the single-gloving and double-gloving phases of the study. The amount of virus transferred to scrubs did not differ significantly in the 2 study phases, and transfer to scrubs occurred in the absence of detectable hand contamination (data not shown). Contamination of the clothing worn under PPE may occur when an item of PPE, such as the gown, contacts the scrubs during removal. This can occur even in the absence of transfer of virus to hands. Our findings suggest that double-gloving did not affect the transfer of virus to scrubs. In this study, the most likely cause of the greater contamination of scrub shirts was accidental contact between shirts and hands or gowns. Although according to protocol, the gown should be grasped by the neckline and pulled off inside out, this still provides an opportunity for the hands or gloves to come in contact with the gown\u2019s fabric, especially near the neck and shoulders. This study was not designed to determine whether penetration of viruses through gown material, in contrast to direct contact with the outside of contaminated PPE items, might be a factor in the contamination of scrubs. The contamination of scrubs observed here suggests that the potential risks posed by handling scrubs that have been worn during patient care, as well as wearing them outside the health care facility after work, merit further examination. Further research is needed to explore the need for measures to prevent the transmission of viruses via contaminated clothing after PPE use.",

Nonetheless, they suggest that the PPE removal protocol itself has little or no effect on the transfer of virus to HCWs\u2019 hands. If the currently recommended removal protocol still results in virus transfer, then double-gloving can provide an alternative technique to decrease the risk of hand contamination during PPE removal. Whether or not double-gloving is used, reinforcing the importance of hand hygiene after PPE removal is vital. Even if effective removal protocols can be formulated, the errors in adhering to the removal protocol observed in this study suggest that a single behavioral change message, such as the wearing of a second pair of gloves in high-risk situations, or a message targeting the importance of hand hygiene specifically after PPE removal, may be simpler than trying to achieve universal adherence to a multistep removal protocol that is then followed by hand hygiene.",

The order in which the single-gloving and double-gloving techniques were tested was the same for all participants (double-gloving first, followed by single-gloving). Because this was a pilot study, we decided that all participants should perform exactly the same activities in exactly the same order. This introduced the possibility that participant fatigue could affect the single-gloving phase. However, we found more errors in PPE removal during the double-gloving phase, suggesting that fatigue may have no affect on errors during the removal process. Future studies should incorporate random assignment of the order of activities to address participant fatigue as a potential variable.",

This method of application allows for precise targeting of the parts of PPE that are contaminated; however, it might not accurately simulate the patterns of virus deposition that would result from aerosol transmission of virus from a patient to a HCW\u2019s PPE.

Although it may provide greater protection against contamination during PPE removal, double-gloving promoted as part of routine barrier precautions still must be accompanied by an emphasis on hand hygiene. This pilot study suggests that double-gloving can reduce the risks of viral contamination of HCWs\u2019 hands during removal of PPE after patient care activities. The double-gloving technique is a promising alternative that should be explored in larger controlled studies of PPE removal and virus transfer risks.",
