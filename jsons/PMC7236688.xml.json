Early presenting symptoms of the virus frequently include fever, non-productive cough and fatigue and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms and anosmia [[2], [3], [4]]. A well-characterized subset of the population contracts the infection with indiscernible symptoms. The average incubation period has been reported to last 14 days, with a median presentation of five days [5,6]. There have been some reports of patients remaining infectious for over 20 days from symptom onset [5]. Without widespread testing, quantification of this asymptomatic group in the pandemic is nearly impossible to determine [6].",

It is believed that up-regulation of ACE2 during infection combined with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or thiazolidinediones can potentially predispose patients to a myriad of complications including, cardiac arrest, impaired ventilation, and death [7]. In addition, current research has found increased mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities including older age, obesity, existing pulmonary diagnoses, and diabetes [[6], [7], [8]]. Additionally, hypertension may also be associated with an increased risk of both contracting symptomatic COVID-19 and hospitalization [7]. Currently, patients contracting the virus have a mortality rate between 4-7% which is nearly four times that of the influenza virus [2,4]. This close contact disease is spread via respiratory droplets which can enter the respiratory tract via mucosae or conjunctiva [8,9]. Transmission can also occur through fomites within the immediate environment of an infected person [8].",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends all individuals wear a simple mask when in public and to limit touching their face to prevent viral transmission [13]. The mask should cover the nose and mouth to prevent a contagion from infecting others with a compromised immune system. The CDC currently recommends a N95 mask be utilized for known positive COVID-19 patients [3,13]. Social distancing, which is currently defined as maintaining a distance of six feet from others, should continue among staff and patients. Rearranging waiting room seats, limiting the number of patients, coordinating x-ray time slots and terminal cleaning of all essential equipment is required to comply with social distancing regulations set forth by the CDC to help prevent the spread of the virus [13].",

There are a number of regulatory and compliance matters specific to virtual healthcare at the federal and state levels, as well as payer specific rules [16,17].

A recent retrospective cohort study from China summarized their early operative outcomes on this population [22]. Their findings are consistent with current thoughts suggesting that older individuals with multiple co-morbidities are at higher risk of complications. Surgery on these patients, like a high-energy trauma patient, seems to initiate a \u201csecond-hit\u201d phenomenon that can induce a systemic inflammatory response. Operating on a patient with COVID-19 can have grave consequences with nearly 44% requiring ICU care after surgery and a mortality rate up to 20% [22]. As surgeons, we will need to maintain open communication between the other members of the medical team to provide coordinated care for our patients. The ability to consistently and promptly identify SARS-CoV-2 carriers will further help to navigate this pandemic.
