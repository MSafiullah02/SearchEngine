Apart from providing information about SARS, the campaign also included dissemination of precautionary measures, such as urging people to wear face masks, to pay more attention to personal hygiene, and to enhance their physical well\u2010being. Hong Kong residents began to adopt some of these precautionary measures. The most common ones included wearing face masks in the street and at work, seeking information and monitoring up\u2010to\u2010date news about SARS, and avoiding crowded areas (see Cheng, 2004).",

Population surveys (Chow, 2003; Lam et al., 2003; Tang & Wong, 2003) showed that about 70% of respondents in Hong Kong expressed concerns about the SARS outbreak. However, only half of the respondents worried that they might be infected by SARS (Tang & Wong, 2003). There were also individual differences in coping responses to prevent a SARS infection. Around 20% of respondents reported that they would avoid going to shopping malls, and about the same percentage reported that they would dine out less often (Chow, 2003). Approximately 30% of the respondents reported that they would adopt the preventive measures recommended by the Department of Health (e.g., wearing face masks, cleansing hands after sneezing). About 80% of the respondents thought that face masks were unnecessary, and 15% said that they would not wear a mask under any circumstances.",

It is noteworthy that these surveys were conducted in the period between March 17 and March 22, that is, before the occurrence of a mass infection at a housing estate in Hong Kong on March 28. As shown in another population survey conducted between March 29 and April 2 (Lam et al., 2003), immediately after the mass infection was reported, around 90% of respondents reported that they had adopted the preventive measures, and almost all the respondents (98%) reported having worn a face mask.

First, although people may be facing the same dread and unknown health risk, not all of them experience the same extent of anxiety or adopt the same number of coping strategies. Considerable individual differences in anxiety and coping responses are seen. Second, although individual differences in anxiety and coping responses can be major in certain circumstances, they can also be minimal in others (e.g., after the mass infection). Third, survey findings obtained at different time points showed that coping responses may change drastically after the occurrence of certain critical events, thus indicating that coping responses can fluctuate across situations and over time.",

In the state\u2010trait theories of anxiety (Cattell, 1963; Spielberger, 1972), anxiety is conceptualized as a complex construct that comprises both a transitory state and a personality trait. The transitory state, or as it is more commonly termed, state anxiety, refers to a condition that varies in strength over time. State anxiety is evoked in situations perceived by individuals as threatening. The amount of state anxiety experienced is a function of the extent of perceived threat. The personality trait, or as it is more commonly termed, trait anxiety, refers to individual differences in proneness to experience state anxiety in threatening situations. Such anxiety\u2010proneness is relatively stable over time. The state\u2010trait theories of anxiety related individual differences in anxiety to personality dispositions. Trait anxiety is proposed as a predictor of state anxiety. Compared to individuals lower in trait anxiety, individuals higher in trait anxiety are speculated to experience greater state anxiety in threatening situations.",

The construct of coping has been considered an important mediator that accounts for the stress\u2010anxiety relationship (e.g., Folkman & Lazarus, 1988; Krohne, 1986). In the transaction theory of coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), coping is considered as an ongoing process that occurs within the interface of changing personal and situational demands. Coping is conceptualized as a state\u2010like, situation\u2010specific response for meeting the unique demands of distinct stressful situations. This theory provides a detailed account of how individuals change their behaviors when handling different types of situations. Situation\u2010specific coping is proposed to play a role in mitigating anxiety in the coping process.",

Lazarus and Folkman (1984) put forward a goodness\u2010of\u2010fit hypothesis in their theory to explain coping efficacy. Effective coping involves a good \u201cfit\u201d or match between situational characteristics and the nature of coping strategies. Individuals who deploy coping strategies that meet specific situational demands are said to experience adaptive outcomes in stressful encounters. Because the environment is ever changing, the construct of coping flexibility (see e.g., Cheng, 2003; Watanabe, Iwanaga, & Ozeki, 2002) was proposed to reflect situation\u2010appropriate coping in changing times. Coping flexibility is conceptualized as the ability to distinguish among different situations and to switch strategies to meet changing situational demands (see e.g., Cheng, 2001; Schwartz & Daltroy, 1999). The construct has been found to be inversely related to anxiety (e.g., Kaluza, 2000; Lester, Smart, & Baum, 1994; Mattlin, Wethington, & Kessler, 1990; Watanabe et al., 2002). Individuals who are more flexible in coping, compared to those who are less flexible in coping, tend to experience less anxiety across stressful situations.",

People had no idea what the disease was and how to cope with it. Such ambiguities may have given rise to considerable individual differences in feelings toward the disease and ways of preventing it. At Time 2, a mass infection had broken out in a housing estate at almost the same time. A person with chronic renal disease, believed to be the \u201csuperspreader,\u201d spread the disease to hundreds of residents in a building block. The nature of the ambiguous, stressful context quickly turned into an imminent danger. Alarmed by mass infection in the community, people were almost unanimous in actively adopting coping strategies to avoid contracting SARS. At Time 3, a hoaxer further aroused panic by hijacking the design of a major newspaper Web site. The hoaxer posted a bogus news item that Hong Kong would soon be declared an infected region and be sealed off from the rest of the world. Such a rumor quickly spread around the city, causing panic\u2010stricken people to mob stores to buy necessities. While the influence of this anxiety\u2010arousing rumor was attenuated, another anxiety\u2010provoking event emerged shortly after that. At Time 4, the number of death cases had grown rapidly. Within the week, death cases were reported every day, the highest being five for a particular day. Deaths were no longer confined to the elderly and people with serious illnesses, but also involved healthy young adults, thus further adding to the mystery of SARS.",

In personality psychology, the trait approach and the person\u2010situation interactionist approach are two major theoretical paradigms explicating individual differences in behaviors. Trait theories (e.g., Allport, 1961; Cattell, 1967) propose that individuals are predisposed to a particular personality trait or style, which remains largely stable across situations. Person\u2010situation interactionist theories (e.g., Magnusson, 1974; Mischel, 1977) maintain that personality characteristics are manifested in some situations but not in others. These two approaches to personality may each have made unique contributions to the literature. Stable personality traits may be useful in predicting behavioral tendency. Situation\u2010specific behaviors may provide a detailed account of how individuals react to the specific demands of situations. Consistent with this notion, the present results suggest that both personality traits and situation\u2010specific behaviors can predict anxiety responses in a real\u2010life stressful context. An integrative approach may be beneficial in addressing the confluence of these perspectives by including both stable personality style and situation\u2010driven responses in the study of behaviors. The understanding of behaviors may be enhanced by an analysis of these two types of factors.",

Although it is possible to analyze longitudinal data using repeated measures analytical methods, HLM offers several unique advantages over these traditional methods. First, HLM allows an analysis of variables with distinct initial statuses for different individuals as well as linear and quadratic changes with random effects. However, the initial status, linear change, and quadratic change are set at the same point for all individuals in repeated measures analytical methods.",

The present results have demonstrated the effects of both time\u2010invariant (trait anxiety) and time\u2010varying (avoidance and personal hygiene practice) variables on changes in state anxiety over time. Thus, HLM seems to be more appropriate for testing both types of variables. In addition, with the inclusion of time\u2010invariant variables (e.g., trait anxiety) as moderators in the HLM, researchers can examine how these personality traits contribute to linear and quadratic changes of a dependent variable. Thus, stable traits are hypothesized as moderators of the different relationships for the dynamic time\u2010dependent variables. In short, HLM provides a conceptual orientation and a flexible set of statistical techniques for analyzing both stable personality traits and dynamic situation\u2010specific behaviors. This method is recommended for researchers who are interested in examining both trait and situation\u2010specific behaviors.",

In coping research, coping includes not only behavioral coping but also cognitive coping. It is possible that some participants may have adopted cognitive and behavioral strategies other than those listed in the questionnaire developed for this study. Further studies examining the integrative approach should expand the scope of psychological responses by including cognitive and behavioral coping strategies.",

The sample size issue is complicated in HLM because there are two levels of sample size: (a) number of measurement occasions at level 1, and (b) number of participants at level 2. Raudenbush and Liu (2000) suggested a trade\u2010off between sample sizes at different levels. Increasing the number of measurement occasions at level 1 can reduce the number of participants at level 2 provided that the same power is required to detect the changes across time. Maxwell (2000) also demonstrated how statistical power increases dramatically when more time\u2010points are added to the design.
