Host germ line-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) generated by invading pathogens, such as lipids, lipoproteins, proteins and nucleic acids. Among these PAMPs, recognition of pathogen-derived nucleic acids is a general strategy used by host cells to detect infectious agents, a subject of intense study in past decades.",

Viral RNAs are typically recognized by two classes of PRRs, membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). While TLRs such as TLR3 recognize viral RNA in the endosome of certain immune cells, RLRs, including RIG-I and MDA5, are essential for the recognition of cytosolic viral RNA in most cell types [1]. Upon recognition of viral RNAs, RIG-I and MDA5 are recruited to the mitochondrial adaptor protein VISA (also known as MAVS, IPS-1, and Cardif) [2], [3], [4], [5], which triggers a series of signaling cascades that lead to the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. Activated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB work synergistically to induce the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, leading to innate antiviral responses.",

            "text": "The presence of DNA in endosome or the cytosol is also a danger signal for the innate immune system. These DNA molecules, including exogenous DNA derived from invading pathogens and endogenous inappropriately aggregated self-DNA, can be recognized by DNA sensing systems to initiate innate immune responses [6], [7], [8]. Compared to the well-studied RNA-induced innate immune responses, our understanding of DNA-triggered signaling is relatively limited. Exhilaratingly, the discovery of many DNA sensors and downstream adaptors, especially the discovery of MITA, has shed new light on cytosolic DNA-triggered signaling pathways. Using expression cloning, several groups independently identified MITA (Mediator of IRF3 Activation, also known as STING, MPYS, ERIS and TMEM173) as a critical mediator of the innate immune response to cytosolic nucleic acid ligands [9], [10], [11], [12]. Subsequently, a series of studies have established the essential roles of MITA in innate immune responses to DNA viruses [9], [13], [14], [15], some RNA viruses [9], [10], [11], [16], [17], retroviruses [18], [19], bacteria [9], [13], [20], [21], [22] and protozoan parasites [23]. Additionally, MITA has a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases triggered by recognition of self-DNA that inappropriately accumulates in the cytoplasm [6], [24], which has been reviewed elsewhere [25]. Although most studies have focused on nucleic acid-triggered signaling, MITA has also been proposed to sense virus-cell membrane fusion events [26].",

Homologs in other species, including Sus scrofa, Bos Taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus, Drosophila, and Danio rerio, also exhibit high sequence similarity [11], [27], [28], [29]. MITA contains four transmembrane motifs in the N-terminus (aa1-137), which predominantly anchors itself in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and partially in the mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) [9], [10], [11], [13]. The C-terminal domain (CTD, aa138-379) extends into the cytosol to bind the cytosolic CDNs and recruits downstream factors (Fig. 1\n). Among tissues surveyed, MITA showed high expression in the heart, spleen, peripheral leukocytes, placenta and lung, and moderate expression in the thymus, small intestines, liver and kidney, but almost undetectable expression in the brain, skeletal muscle and colon. Among transformed cell lines, MITA is highly expressed in THP-1, U937, L929 and Raw264.7 cells, making them sensitive to DNA stimulation, but is poorly expressed in HEK293T, HeLa, and Huh-7 cells [11], [30]. This expression pattern suggests that MITA might function in the immune system.",

TLR9 is known to recognize CpG-DNA in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and transduce signals through the adaptor protein MyD88 to induce type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines [36], [37]. Genetic evidence suggests that DAI is not required for the sensing of cytosolic DNA in the cell types examined, including mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages from DAI-deficient mice [38]. RNA polymerase III only responds to AT-rich dsDNA and signals through the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway [39]. DDX41 was reported to sense cytosolic DNA in human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), BMDCs and monocytes. DDX41 binds to poly(dA:dT) or HSV-1 DNA via its DEADc domain, resulting in its interaction with MITA and activation of TBK1 [15]. Another reported DNA sensor, IFI16, can bind to both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), leading to IFN production and inflammation through MITA- and ASC-mediated pathways, respectively [40]. LSm14A, a member of the LSm family involved in RNA processing in the processing bodies, has recently been demonstrated as a sensor of viral nucleic acids [41]. LSm14A can bind to poly(I:C), poly(dA:dT) and viral DNA. Depletion of LSm14A markedly reduces both SeV- and HSV-1-induced IFN-\u03b2, suggesting that LSm14A mediates innate immune responses to both RNA and DNA viruses [41]. It has also been reported that MITA can associate with both ssDNA and dsDNA, thereby directly acting as a DNA sensor [42]. However, none of these candidates seems to be a universally required DNA sensor for detecting viral DNA in distinct cell types or at the animal level.",

Expression analysis showed that the expression of murine cGAS was high in Raw264.7 cells and BMDMs, but low in immortalized MEFs, suggesting a role for cGAS in the immune system. Genetic studies suggested that cGAS is required for the responses to all the DNA or DNA viruses examined, including HA-DNA, E. coli DNA, poly(dA:dT), ISD, HAV-1 and VACA, to induce type I IFNs in primary fibroblasts, macrophages, and DCs [46]. Additionally, cGAS is required for innate immune control of DNA virus in mice, such as HSV-1, MHV68 and vaccinia virus [46], [47]. A recent study established cGAS as the dominant cytosolic DNA sensor responsible for the detection of internalized adenovirus [48]. Furthermore, cGAS is essential for retrovirus-triggered innate immune responses by sensing reverse-transcribed DNA [18]. Based on these advances, cGAS seems to be a general sensor of cytosolic DNA in most immune cells [47].",

Furthermore, genetic studies suggested that MITA deficiency rendered MEFs highly susceptible to VSV, but less susceptibility was observed in BMDCs or BMDMs, implicating MITA is involved in innate antiviral response in specific cell types to certain RNA viruses [9]. In vivo, MITA-deficient mice were defective in type I IFN production and highly susceptible to lethal infection with VSV but not encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [13].

Specifically, the C-terminus of MITA (aa341-379) is required and sufficient for interactions with TBK1 and IRF3 that facilitate IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 [62]. Crystal structures of MITA also suggest the role of the MITA C-terminus in mediating protein interactions [53], [54]. Approximately 40 residues at the C-terminus of MITA could not be modeled in crystal structures, suggesting that the C-terminus of MITA is highly flexible and most likely protrudes from the concave cavity to interact with downstream proteins, such as TBK1 and IRF3 [53], [54]. Surprisingly, a truncated MITA protein that only contained aa139-344 could strongly interact with TBK1 in the presence of c-di-GMP, suggesting the presence of an additional TBK1 binding region of MITA [54]. However, another group found that MITA did not directly facilitate the activation of IRF3 by TBK1 in an in vitro kinase assay because TBK1 alone was sufficient to phosphorylate IRF3. This discrepancy most likely resulted from the use of excess protein in vitro [47].",

However, purified MITA in solution exists as a dimer, and crystallography studies showed that the CTD of MITA exists as a symmetrical V-shaped dimer both in the presence and absence of a ligand [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58]. There are at least two possible reasons for this discrepancy. Most likely, MITA exists as a weak dimer under physiological conditions, which is easily disturbed by the conditions used for normal detection methods. Upstream activators or ligand binding can strengthen MITA dimerization, thereby making it easier to detect the dimeric form of MITA. This hypothesis is supported by a report that c-di-GMP binds to the MITA dimer interface in a perfectly symmetrical manner, thereby acting as a \u2018glue\u2019 to reinforce MITA homodimer by increasing the dimer interface area [53]. Alternatively, it remains possible that dimerization of MITA is signal-induced.",

First, Brefeldin A, known to cause disassembly of the Golgi complex [66], blocked MITA trafficking, indicating that Golgi apparatuses are involved in the translocation of MITA. Second, in the presence of dsDNA, MITA co-localized with the early endosome marker early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and the recycling endosome marker transferrin receptor (TFR) [13]. Third, upon ISD stimulation, MITA associates with Sec5, a component of exocysts that is involved in vesicle trafficking. Depletion of Sec5 impairs the function of MITA, suggesting that exocysts are involved in MITA-mediated signal transduction [9], [13]. Finally, HSV-1 infection causes MITA to predominantly associate with microsomes, complexes of continuous membranes that include the ER, Golgi and transport vesicles [13]. In summary, DNA stimulation causes MITA to translocate from the ER via the Golgi apparatuses to vesicles in the perinuclear region, where it forms punctate structures.",

However, electron microscopy analyses revealed that MITA-containing puncta induced by dsDNA stimulation did not exhibit the morphological characteristics of autophagosomes, suggesting that the puncta may represent a unique membrane structure. Another study proposed that this puncta is an endo/lysosome [13]. However, it has also been shown that MITA does not localize to endosomes or lysosomes after dsDNA stimulation [65].

The cleavage site of MITA was mapped to LRR96/G, which is not conserved in mouse MITA and render it resistant to NS2B3 cleavage [77].

Many studies have confirmed that MITA is important in RNA virus-triggered signaling and MITA is targeted by various viruses for immune evasion. It has also been established that MITA is essential for innate immune responses against DNA-producing pathogens, including DNA viruses, retroviruses, bacteria, and parasites. Thus, additional studies of differential regulation of MITA-mediated signaling in response to RNA and DNA, and the crosstalks between these pathways will benefit our understanding of mechanisms of innate immune responses. The identification of cGAS as a critical DNA sensor and CDNs (including c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP and cGAMP) as direct ligands of MITA significantly advanced our understanding of DNA sensing and signaling. Nevertheless, it will also be necessary to clarify and confirm the role of other DNA sensors using more rigorous strategies, including a determination of the relationships of other sensors with cGAS. Additionally, the mechanisms of MITA activation remain obscure, as the crystallography studies did not provide evidence of ligand-induced conformational changes coupled to downstream signaling. The crystallization of full-length MITA associated with ligands or downstream components could be critical for further uncovering the mechanisms of MITA-mediated signal transduction. Another important question is how MITA mediates NF-\u03baB activation, a critical event in innate immunity. It will be interesting to investigate whether NF-\u03baB activation is also associated with formation of punctate structures. Furthermore, given the different responses in mouse and human cells, the functions of murine and human MITA might not be completely similar; discrepancies could result from critical amino acid changes, differential regulation by viruses, or other mechanisms [9], [10], [13], [45], [52]. Resolving these issues will contribute to our understanding of innate immune responses, and provide clues for drug and vaccine development against infectious and autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Schematic presentation of MITA structure. Human MITA contains four N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domains, which anchor itself in ER, mitochondria (MT) and mitochodria-associated membrane (MAM). Its C-terminal domain (CTD) hangs in the cytosol, which is responsible for CDN binding and recruitment of downstream components including TBK1 and IRF3. The CTD also contains a dimerization domain (DD) and a flexible C-terminal tail (CTT). MITA is post-translationally modified with K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination by the indicated E3 ubiquitin ligases and with phosphorylation (P) by the indicated kinases.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: MITA-mediated signaling pathways in response to cytosolic nucleic acids. MITA is involved in both RNA and DNA pathogen-triggered signaling. MITA functions downstream of RIG-I and VISA in response to infection by some RNA viruses, leading to activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, which induces type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. It is likely that mitochondria- or MAM-associated MITA is involved in this process. DNA from pathogens such as DNA viruses, bacteria and parasites can be detected by cGAS, which synthesizes noncanonical cGAMP that subsequently binds to ER-localized MITA to initiate downstream signaling. Cytosolic DNA can also be detected by other DNA sensors to activate MITA, but whether cGAS is involved in these processes has not been determined. Bacteria can also trigger innate immune defense by secreting c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP that directly bind to MITA. Retroviruses generate cDNA during reverse transcription that can also be sensed by cGAS, which then produces cGAMP to activate MITA. Furthermore, aberrantly aggregated self-DNA can also trigger innate immune responses in a MITA-dependent manner, but whether cGAS or other DNA sensors are involved remains unclear. Upon binding to CDNs or activation by upstream DNA sensors, MITA traffics to the perinuclear region and forms punctate structures that contain IRF3 and TBK1, facilitating TBK1-IRF3 interactions and phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1. Activated IRF3 collaborates with NF-\u03baB to induce type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. However, the molecular mechanism that links MITA to NF-\u03baB activation remains unclear. Additionally, MITA can recruit STAT6 to the ER upon virus infection, leading to TBK1-dependent phosphorylation, dimerization and subsequent translocation of STAT6 into the nucleus where it induces transcription of CCL2, CCL20 and CCL26. MAM, mitochondria associated membrane; Puncta, perinuclear punctate structure; MITA, also known as STING, MPYS, ERIS and TMEM173; VISA, also known as MAVS, IPS-1 and Cardif.",
