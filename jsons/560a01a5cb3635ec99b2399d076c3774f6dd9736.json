We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite-mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.",

Mathematical models of single-host, single-parasite systems suggest that horizontally transmitted parasites will be lost if host populations decline below a critical threshold density (Anderson & May 1992) . For several reasons, however, parasiteinduced extinction are more probable in situations involving multihost parasites and frequency-dependent transmission and when in concert with other drivers of extinction (de Castro & Bolker 2005) . First, many parasites can infect multiple species, and high prevalence in alternative hosts coupled with cross-species transmission can lead to parasite-induced declines in species that would normally be unable to maintain the parasite (Gog et al. 2002; Fenton & Pedersen 2005) . In carnivores, for example, several near extinctions have been caused by generalist parasites transmitted to populations of threatened species (Woodroffe 1999; Lafferty & Gerber 2002) . Second, the transmission of some parasites, such as sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, may be decoupled from host population density (Getz & Pickering 1983) ; these parasites can therefore continue to spread even as host populations decline (Boots & Sasaki 2003) . Finally, many threatened mammals are predisposed to extinction risk because their populations are fragmented and small and they have low genetic variability (Woodroffe 1999; Altizer et al. 2003) . These factors can increase host sus-ceptibility and exposure to infectious diseases (Lyles & Dobson 1993) , or infectious diseases might represent an additional factor that increases stochastic extinction risk (McCallum & Dobson 1995) .",

Only 3.7% of 833 known species extinctions have been attributed in part or directly to infectious disease.

We further predicted that parasites reported to cause population declines in threatened mammals would have broad host ranges and be transmitted via biting arthropods, contaminated food or water, or other indirect routes that are decoupled from direct host contact. Finally, we investigated sampling gaps and potential biases in the degree to which Conservation Biology Volume 21, No. 5, 2007 parasites have been identified as risk factors for threatened mammals. Relative to other threatened hosts, we tested whether mammal species identified as threatened by parasites were better studied in terms of infectious diseases, had higher levels of parasitism overall, or possessed host traits that might facilitate parasite establishment, including higher population density, greater body mass, or larger geographic ranges.",

For each mammal species for which data were available (n = 4864), we recorded threat status as nonthreatened (least concern), near threatened, and threatened (conservation-dependent, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, and extinct in the wild). Independent of host threat status, we also recorded mammal species or subspecies for which parasites have been identified as a major cause of threat based on summary documentation in the IUCN Red List for \"major threats.\" Identification of a major threat is based on two classifications: \"invasive alien species -pathogens/parasites\" (threat 2.4), and \"changes in native species dynamics -pathogens/parasites\" (threat 8.5). For many species, key information regarding the causes of endangerment is available only in detailed reports that are not accessible via on-line searches of the IUCN Red List (Clavero & Garcia-Berthou 2005) . This can lead to missing records and potential systematic biases if, for example, some types of species have summary documentation available, whereas others do not. This is unlikely to be a problem in our data set, however, because summary documentation on cause of threat was specified for 73% of threatened species and included species from each of the major mammal clades.",

For another 14 mammals, the IUCN Species Assessment Accounts discussed disease as a general cause of concern, but no specific parasites were identified or the assessment was based on predicted disease risk. For six mammal species (11%), the published literature provided no evidence that the species had been studied for infectious diseases, and IUCN Species Assessment Accounts provided no specific details on the parasite-related threats.",

            "text": "Wild mammals are a well-studied taxonomic group that is currently experiencing a wave of extinctions (Purvis Cardillo et al. 2005) . It has become increasingly clear that infectious diseases represent an emerging cause of population declines and extinctions in threatened mammal species (Daszak et al. 2000; Lafferty & Gerber 2002; Smith et al. 2006 ). Our results demonstrate that several host and parasite characteristics are important for predicting infectious disease risks for threatened mammal. First, the majority (88%) of mammals identified as threatened by parasites were from just two taxonomic orders: artiodactyls and carnivores. Within these clades, host families with the greatest frequency of species threatened by parasites also included all major groups of domesticated livestock and companion animals (including dogs, cats, goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs). By comparison, no bats (0.0% of 1024) and only one rodent species (<0.01% of 2041) were identified as being threatened by parasites. One explanation for this pattern is that close phylogenetic relationships with domesticated mammals, which are globally distributed and maintained at high densities, can intensify the risk of cross-species transmission to related wildlife species. Given that parasites are more likely to be shared or to jump between closely related host species (Brooks & McLennan 1991) and that over 80% of livestock and domesticated carnivore parasites can also infect wildlife (Cleaveland et al. 2001) , it is not surprising that species in these lineages suffer more heavily from infectious diseases.",

These parasites included well-known agents such as foot-andmouth disease virus, morbilliviruses that cause canine distemper and rinderpest, and bacteria that cause bovine tuberculosis and anthrax (Table 1) . Counter to expectations, 75% of parasites identified as threatening were transmitted by close contact, rather than by arthropod vectors or contact with contaminated soil or water. Although previous studies have highlighted the characteristics of parasites that pose significant health risk to humans and animals Gog et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2005) , our study represents the first to evaluate these factors in the context of extinction risk. Consistent with these studies Woolhouse et al. 2001 ), we found that viruses, due to their typically wide host ranges and high mutation rates (Domingo & Holland 1994) , are most likely to threaten mammals. This is further supported by our finding that ssRNA viruses, which have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses (Drake et al. 1998) , comprised over 70% of the viruses identified as causing declines in threatened mammals.",

This pattern was particularly striking for helminths, which represent the greatest diversity of parasites of wild mammals (Nunn et al. 2003; Ezenwa et al. 2006; Lindenfors et al. 2007 ). One explanation is that many helminth infections cause sublethal fitness effects or cyclical changes in host abundance, both of which are difficult to quantify in wild mammal populations (Hudson et al. 1998) . When combined with other parasites or environmental stressors, helminths could pose significant conservation threats. For example, population declines in bighorn sheep (Ovis candadensis) may have been caused by interactions between stress, lungworm infection (Protostrongylus spp.), and bacteria (Pastuerella spp.), which lead to pneumonia outbreaks that resulted in high mortality and low reproductive success (Forrester 1971; Jones & Worley 1994) . Further investigation of the effects of helminths and other macroparasites is needed to understand their role in mammalian extinction risk.",

We did not have historical data to distinguish between these cases. Nevertheless, within the subset of threatened species, we predicted that vulnerability to pathogenmediated declines would be correlated with traits known to increase parasite transmission or species richness (e.g., large body size, high population density; Nunn et al. 2003; Cardillo et al. 2005) . Similarly, species threatened by parasites may have been better studied for parasites than other threatened mammals. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that mammals identified as threatened by parasites were better studied for infectious disease, had higher threatened by parasites (IUCN 2006) , which is consistent with a recent review of parasite-mediated extinction risk across plants and animals (Smith et al. 2006) . One contributing factor could be a lack of accessible information on infectious diseases in threatened mammal populations. Published studies of parasite infections in natural populations were available for <40% of the world's most threatened primates, carnivores, and artiodactyls. Furthermore, over 25% of the mammals classified as threatened by parasites by the IUCN had little or no published information concerning the effects of disease on wild populations. For example, an Australian marsupial (the Dibbler [Parantechinus apicalis]) was identified as threatened by parasites, but literature searches revealed instead that a plant pathogen (Phytopthora cinnamomi) was negatively affecting native plants in its preferred habitat (Friend 2004) . For West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus) and marine otters (Lontra felina), infectious disease was perceived to be a future risk even though no current parasite-mediated declines have been reported.",

            "text": "Our results provide optimism that strategies can be employed to reduce the risk of parasite-mediated wildlife declines. Vaccination of domesticated animal reservoirs could be an effective control strategy for minimizing the transmission of pathogens to wildlife hosts (Lafferty & Gerber 2002) . Outbreaks caused by many of the reported parasites resulted from direct contact with domesticated animals, in some cases from infections that would not have spread or persisted in wildlife in the absence of domesticated animals. As one example, rinderpest virus declined dramatically in wild populations of African bovids following the widespread vaccination of domesticated cattle (Plowright 1982) . A campaign is currently underway in the Serengeti ecosystem to immunize domesticated dogs against rabies, canine distemper, and parvovirus, with the goal to reduce disease outbreaks in lions, African wild dogs, and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) (Cleaveland et al. 2000 (Cleaveland et al. , 2003 . Alternative strategies could focus on minimizing contacts between domestic animal reservoir hosts and endangered wildlife species (Woodroffe 1999) , particularly because our results suggest that close contact is a major route of transmission for these harmful parasites. Minimizing cross-species contact could be accomplished through physical barriers that reduce the potential for close contact or by limiting temporal overlap in the use of water resources or grazing habitats. These strategies have been effective in reducing bighorn sheep epidemics, specifically through the construction of buffer zones between agricultural areas and ranges of bighorn sheep ( Jessup et al. 1991 ( Jessup et al. , 1995 .",

Efforts to provide a more comprehensive view of the role of parasites in wildlife extinction risk will require increased collaboration among wildlife ecologists, veterinary workers, and conservation organizations. Characteristics of threatening parasites highlight the possibility that future control strategies targeted at reducing cross-species transmission of high-risk parasites, either by vaccination or by limiting contact with domestic animals, may significantly reduce the risk of parasite-mediated wildlife declines.",
