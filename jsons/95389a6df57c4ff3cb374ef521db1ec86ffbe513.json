Respiratory failure has many causes and can come on abruptly (acute respiratory failure), when the underlying cause progresses rapidly, or slowly (chronic respiratory failure), when it is associated over months or even years with a progressive underlying process. Triggering causes of ARF in advanced aged patients are especially acute heart decompensation, severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), and pulmonary embolism. Pneumothorax, lung cancer, severe sepsis, and acute asthma were less frequent (<5%) [2] .",
