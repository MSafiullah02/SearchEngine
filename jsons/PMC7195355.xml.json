The virus is given name Coronavirus due to the similarity of its spike protein to the crown (Latin corona) [3]. SARS CoV-2 virus belongs to group IV Coronaviruses and is the member of the order Nidoviriales, Family Coronaviridae, Subfamily Coronavirinae, and Genus Betacoronavirus [4]. The virus genome is a ~30 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA that encodes structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. The virion is enveloped and spherical with a diameter of 60\u2013140 nm and with the spike length of 9\u201312 nm. The phylogenetic study suggested a closer relation of this virus to bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-CoVZC45 than to human SARS [5]. The early cases reported infection in people after attending the seafood and animal market, thereby suggesting the animal to human transmission of the virus. The later cases indicated the sustained human to human transmission of SARS CoV-2 [6], [7]. Human to human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and fomites. The primary site of infection is in epithelial cells of respiratory or enteric tracts while secondary sites are kidney and heart though in question [8]. Currently, there is no cure for the COVID-19, and clinicians are solely depending upon the drugs that could provide symptomatic relief. The clinical trials are performed using drugs that have been known to treat other viral infections/related diseases.",

The drugs or therapeutic materials are likely to be effective in the COVID-19 treatment if they either block the entry of the viral particles to cells or block the intracellular viral components [9]. The latter property plays one of the important roles in halting the propagation of viruses from infected cells while blocking the virus particles at the extracellular site inhibits the cell infection. Many factors define the effectiveness of the drug molecules, including their sustainability in the environment and cell penetration capacity.",

To ensure the effective internalization of the potential drugs with demonstrated activity against the viral protease, polymerase, and RNA, serum albumin could be used as an excellent delivery vehicle. Serum albumin is a multifunctional protein known to interact with a range of exogenous and endogenous compounds. It is predominately present in the extracellular space, with high concentration being reported in the skin, guts, muscles, fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural), and secretions such as sweat, tear, milk, and saliva [10]. The well-known fact about albumin is that there is a complex relationship between the inflammation and albumin level in the extracellular matrix under various physiological and pathological conditions [11], [12], [13]. The earlier studies indicated that the stressed and inflamed cells increase the uptake of albumin [11], [12], [13].",
