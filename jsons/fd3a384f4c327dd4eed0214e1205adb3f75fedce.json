Topographical features include acinar cells, which contain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysozyme-and lactoferrin-positive zymogen granules (ZG), and synthesize and secrete secretory component (SC); myoepithelial cells, which are adjacent to acinar cells and surrounded by a basement membrane (BM); interstitial plasma cells, which are the primary lymphoid cell and produce principally IgA, but also some IgG, IgM or IgD; T helper (T H ) and suppressor (T S ) cells, which are distributed throughout the interstitium, the intercellular spaces between acinar or ductal cells, and the periductular lymphoid aggregates; B cells (B), OKT6 + Langerhans-type dendritic cells (DC), and OKM1 + monocyte-macrophages are predominantly located in periductular lymphoid aggregates, which most often appear as primary follicles without germinal center formation and may be active in antigen processing; and unlabelled, darkened cells, which refer to circulating T or B lymphocytes, which may originate in other mucosal tissues (e.g., intestinal Peyer's patch) and, if not retained locally, possibly exit the lacrimal gland through lymphatic channels to regional cervical or preauricular lymph nodes. Immunoglobulin A is secreted by plasma cells, bound by SC on the acinar cell basolateral membrane, transported in distinct vesicles, and released at the apical surface as S-IgA into tear-containing lumina. (This figure has been reproduced and published courtesy of Ophthalmology 1988; 95: 100-109.) stitial regions, and within small, periductular, lymphoid aggregates. The distribution of T cells varies topographically by subclass, which include CD8 + suppressor/cytotoxic and CD4 + helper T cells, which have a helper:suppressor ratio of approximately 0.5. Minor populations of lacrimal immunocytes include surface Ig-bearing B cells, Langerhans-type dendritic cells, monocyte-macrophages, and activated, IL-2positive T cells, which occur almost exclusively in periductular foci, appearing as primary follicles without germinal centers (Wieczorek et al., 1988; Dua et al., 1994; Pepose et al., 1996) . Lacrimal glands of rats, rabbits, and mice share the immune features of the human gland (see Table 86 .1).",

Lacrimal acinar cells produce lysozyme, lactoferrin, and \u03b2lysin, which have antibacterial properties. Lysozyme is a bacteriolytic enzyme that makes up 40% of tear protein Gillette et al., 1981) . Although its existence in tears has been debated (Janssen et al., 1984) , the nonlysozyme factor \u03b2-lysin is also bacteriolytic (Ford et al., 1976) . Lactoferrin makes up 25% of the protein in human tears and has several functions. It enhances the function of NK cells, it deprives bacteria of iron, and it inhibits the formation of biologically active complement by inhibiting the formation of C3 convertase (Arnold et al., 1982; Kijlstra et al., 1983; Kievits and Kijlstra, 1985; Mestecky and McGhee, 1987; Caccavo et al., 2002) . Lacrimal glands also produce and secrete into the tears antimicrobial peptides including defensins (Haynes et al., 1998) . Many additional molecules including growth factors and cytokines related to ocular surface health are produced in the lacrimal gland and have been identified in tears. The immunologic characteristics of human accessory lacrimal tissue appear to be identical to those of the major lacrimal gland (Gillette et al., , 1981 Sacks et al., 1986) .",

The conjunctiva has been postulated to possess a system of specific immune defense in the form of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (Chandler and Gillette, 1983 ). MALT consists of arrangements of lymphatic cells located in and closely beneath the epithelium, which function to detect antigen and induce immune responses by the direct action of the lymphatic cells or by the secretion of soluble antibodies (Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992) . The presence of conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) has been uncertain. In some animal species, components of MALT were described in conjunctiva, showing species-specific differences (Axelrod and Chandler, 1979; Franklin and Remus, 1984; Latkovic, 1989; Ruskell, 1995; Knop and Knop, 1996; Chodosh et al., 1998a Chodosh et al., , 1998b Chodosh and Kennedy, 2002) .

(1998 , \u2022 Recent thymic emigrants, suppressor/cytotoxic, helper, 2001 ; Sullivan et al. (1998) Knop and Knop (2000) analyzed whole mounts of normal human conjunctival sacs and determined the associated lymphoid tissue contains all the components necessary for an immune response and that expression of IgA and secretory component indicates that conjunctiva belongs to the mucosal immune system. Lymphoid tissue was mainly observed in the palpebral conjunctiva, more pronounced in the upper lid than the lower. Diffuse lymphoid tissue of lymphocytes (predominantly T cells) and plasma cells (most of which were IgA + ) formed a thin layer in the lamina propria of all the conjunctival sacs. The overlying epithelium produced secretory component. In three-fifths of the specimens, organized follicular accumulations having a lenticular shape, composed of B lymphocytes, and covered by a lymphoepithelium were embedded in the diffuse lymphoid layer. High endothelial venules were present in all types of lymphoid tissue (Knop and Knop, 1996 , 2000 . Unlike the M cell containing follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) covering Peyer's patches, no differences between the appearance of microvilli of conjunctival FAE and that of nonfollicle-associated epithelium were noted by transmission electron microscopy in 13 mammalian species (Chodosh et al., 1998b; Chodosh and Kennedy, 2002) . Despite the apparent ubiquity of conjunctival lymphoid follicles in rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs, sheep, cows, rhesus monkeys, baboons, owl monkeys, bush baby monkeys, and humans, few or no lymphoid tissues were identified in mice or rats (Setzer et al., 1987; Chodosh et al., 1998b) , although MALT has recently been demonstrated in nictitating membranes of mice (Sakimoto et al., 2002) . Similar lymphoid tissue was also observed inside the lacrimal drainage system and has been termed lacrimal drainageassociated lymphoid tissue (LDALT) (Knop and Knop, 2001) . The presence of organized CALT appears to be related to antigenic exposure, as evidenced by the rapid increase in conjunctival lymphoid tissue in early youth and a reduced amount under germfree conditions (McMaster et al., 1967) . CALT and LDALT appear to be regularly present and to belong to the common mucosal immune system and to the secretory immune system. Together with the lacrimal gland, they may form a functional unit connected by tear flow, lymphocyte migration, and probably the neural reflex arc, and play a major role in preserving ocular surface integrity (Knop and Knop, 2000; Rolando and Zierhut, 2001; Knop and Knop, 2001) . In addition, the conjunctiva contains the immunologic capacity for antigen processing, cell-mediated immunity, and hypersensitivity responses Chandler and Gillette, 1983; Hann et al., 1985; Sacks et al., 1986; Cornell-Bell et al., 1986; Abelson and Smith, 1991; Montgomery and Whittum-Hudson, 1996) .",

            "text": "Although the conjunctiva and the cornea are similarly exposed to the outside environment, the defensive mechanisms of the two tissues are fundamentally different. Whereas the conjunctiva is a highly reactive tissue that is protected by a potent immune system, the cornea is relatively unreactive, with the immune system repressed to some extent to avoid inflammatory reactions that could compromise the cornea's transparency. Defense is aided by cell polarity, tight cell junctions, and continual replacement of the epithelium. The epithelium produces very high levels of membrane-bound complement inhibitors, PAI-2, and has the ability to produce alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antiproteinase, thereby reducing the risk of autologous cell damage (Sack et al., 2001) . The cornea also produces very high levels of antioxidants (Rose et al., 1998) that may protect the ocular surface from reactive oxygen species produced by activated PMN cells. The cornea possesses interstitial IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE, which appear to originate from serum, diffuse from the limbal to central regions, and require extended time periods (e.g., months) for complete turnover (Allansmith and McClellan, 1975; Verhagen et al., 1990; Pleyer et al., 1996) . SC is not produced by the \"normal\" avascular corneal epithelium or stroma . The peripheral cornea, which is in close contact to the conjunctival vasculature, may also contain Langerhans cells and macrophages (Pleyer et al., 1996) . Although early studies determined that lymphocytes and differentiated Langerhans cells are essentially absent from the normal central cornea (Allansmith et al., 1978; Seto et al., 1987) , recent studies using immunohistochemical confocal microscopic analyses of rodent corneal whole mounts have demonstrated the presence of small numbers of CD3 + T cells (both CD4 + and CD8 + ), macrophages, and dendritic cells (Langerhans cells), but no B cells, in the peripheral cornea and limbus (Yang et al., 1998) . In addition to these peripheral cells, a novel MHC class II-negative population of resident corneal Langerhans-type dendritic cells has been identified in the central cornea (Hamrah et al., 2002) . The corneal stroma is endowed with at least three bone marrow-derived dendritic cell subsets (Hamrah et al., 2003) as well as a novel macrophage population (Brissette-Storkus et al., 2002) . In inflammation these dendritic cells become activated, as evidenced by expression of B7 costimulatory markers, and following corneal transplantation, express MHC class II and migrate to the draining lymph nodes (Liu et al., 2002b; Hamrah et al., 2003) . These findings refute the tenet that the cornea is immune privileged because of lack of resident lymphoreticular cells or because of antigenic sequestration from systemic immunity. Membrane-bound or soluble chemotactic factors, locally produced in the periphery, prevent Langerhans cell migration from the limbus unless a stronger stimulus (e.g., IL-1) is produced. IL-1\u03b2 is secreted by corneal epithelial cells in response to IFN\u03b3 or bacterial infection (Wakefield and Lloyd, 1992) . Further, normal keratocytes express MHC class II molecules in response to inflammation, suggesting that keratocytes collaborate with APC in antigen presentation to T cells, leading to activation of the humoral response, cell-mediated immunity, and inflammation (Niederkorn, 1990) . During inflammation, macrophages and neutrophils extravasate from the vasculature and generate cytokines including TGF-\u03b2 IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b2 that facilitate T-cell and B-cell differentiation and activation. Cytokines produced by immune cells and keratocytes exacerbate the inflammatory response, complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and angiogenesis. To counter the cytotoxic damage that may ensue from inflammation, the cornea protects itself by producing TGF-\u03b2 which suppresses cell-mediated immune responses, and Fas-L, which prevents cell-mediated damage to the epithelial cells (Sack et al., 2001) .",

These functions are extremely dependent upon the stability, tonicity, and composition of the tear film structure, the actual architecture of which is not totally resolved. Classically, the tear film has been considered to include an underlying mucin foundation, a middle aqueous component, and an overlying lipid layer (Holly, 1987; Whitcher, 1987; Dartt, 1992) . Recently, a two-layered structure with an underlying aqueous-mucin gel, in which the mucins have a decreasing gradient of concentration from the epithelium to the surface, and an overlying lipid layer, has been proposed (Dilly, 1994) . The thickness of the tear film is also under discussion (Rolando and Zierhut, 2001) . There is evidence that the mucous layer of the film could be as thick as 30 \u03bcm, but a thinner film has also been hypothesized. Recent evidence suggests a 3 \u03bcm thickness for the tear film (King-Smith et al., 2000) . Alteration, deficiency, or loss of the tear film may significantly increase the susceptibility to ocular surface desiccation and infection, corneal ulceration and perforation, and marked visual impairment and blindness (Lamberts, 1983; Whitcher, 1987; Lubniewski and Nelson, 1990; Lemp and Marquardt, 1992; Lemp, 1995) .",

The major mucin species is MUC5AC, present in a variety of molecular sizes and glycoforms (Gipson and Inatomi, 1998; Jumblatt et al., 1999) . The corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells produce a mucinlike glycoprotein (MUC1) at the apical surfaces that constitutes a glycocalyx, which binds loosely to the mucin layer (Gipson and Inatomi, 1998) . This transmembrane mucin facilitates tear film spreading and ocular surface wetting and prevents adherence of foreign debris, cells, or pathogens to the ocular surface. The mucins account for the viscoelastic properties of the tear film, maintaining the dioptic integrity in the interblink period, and minimize the trauma to the ocular surface during blinking (Dilly, 1985; Tiffany, 1994) . There is evidence that S-IgA and small, basically charged tear proteins such as lysozyme accumulate in the ocular mucin layer (Chao et al., 1990; Bogart et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Specific immunity at the ocular surface is mediated primarily through the action of IgA antibodies, which are the predominant immunoglobulin in tears of humans and experimental animals, occur almost entirely in polymeric form, and originate primarily from local production in lacrimal gland plasma cells (Chao et al., 1980; Janssen and van Bijsterveld, 1983; Sullivan and Allansmith, 1984; Peppard and Montgomery, 1987) . In humans, tear IgA is distributed almost equally among IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses (Delacroix et al., 1982) . Most tear IgA appears to be bound to, and transported by, SC, which is synthesized and secreted by lacrimal epithelial cells (Franklin et al., 1973; Gudmundsson et al., 1985; Hann et al., 1989 Hann et al., , 1991 Kelleher et al., 1991; Sullivan et al., 1998) and is present in the tear film as an S-IgA conjugate or as free SC. In addition, although tear Ig levels do not appear to display diurnal rhythms, IgA concentrations may be exceedingly high after prolonged closure of the eyelids (Sack et al., 2000 (Sack et al., , 2001 . S-IgA has significant function in antigen-antibody clearance from the tear film. S-IgA or free SC can agglutinate antigen-IgG complexes (Sack et al., 2002) . Further, PMN cells have an S-IgA receptor and it appears that S-IgA can opsonize bacteria for PMN cell processing (Sibille et al., 1987; Nikolova and Russell, 1995) . S-IgA can also stimulate effector functions in eosinophils (Motegi and Kita, 1998) . Antigen-IgA complexes will not ordinarily activate complement, and, therefore, S-IgA is considered anti-inflammatory in nature (Nikolova et al., 1994) . The role of S-IgA may not be essential in antimicrobial defense because an SC knockout mouse does not exhibit a greater frequency of serious ocular or other mucosal infections . However, lack of J chain inhibits transepithelial transport of IgA and abrogates the development of intestinal antitoxic protection in knockout mice (Lycke et al., 1999) .",

The major sources of the tear aqueous layer are lacrimal and accessory gland secretions.These secretions are derived from two independent processes: a slow constitutive ongoing secretion, consisting of almost exclusively secretory IgA and smaller amounts of free SC, and an inducible neurologically controlled lacrimal secretion. Although complex, the inducible lacrimal secretion consists of predominantly three proteins-lysozyme, lactoferrin, and tear-specific lipocalins, each of which exhibits anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (Sack et al., 2001) .",

The major features of the mucosal immune network, including the relevance of the mucosal system in immune defense, are detailed in a number of publications Childers et al., 1989) , including this volume. The conjunctiva, lacrimal drainage apparatus, and the lacrimal glands fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the common mucosal immune system. As detailed previously, conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) in humans and many species functions as an antigen-sampling and, along with its draining lymph nodes, an immune inductive tissue. Also, the conjunctiva may serve as a mucosal immune effector site (Franklin and Remus, 1984; Franklin, 1989; Knop, 1996, 2000) . The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) also receives antigen after application to the conjunctival sac (Carr et al., 1996; Ridley Lathers et al., 1998) . In contrast, the lacrimal gland functions as a mucosal effector tissue, receiving antigen-stimulated, IgA-committed B cells after antigen stimulation in the intestinal Peyer's patches or other mucosal inductive sites (Franklin et al., 1985) . It contains IgA-secreting plasma cells, which are responsible for the majority of S-IgA released into the tear fluid.",

In addition, definitive ocular immune responses, as well as accumulation of Ig-containing cells in lacrimal tissue (Jackson and Mestecky, 1981; Allansmith et al., 1987) , may be stimulated by antigenic challenge to other sites, including subconjunctival, intracorneal, intravitreal, intranasal, oral, intrabronchial, gastric, intraduodenal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intradermal, or intramuscular routes. The nature (e.g., antibody isotype), extent, and kinetics of these immune reactions appear to be dependent upon the form (e.g., live versus inactivated microorganisms; strain), concentration, route, duration, and frequency of antigen administration. Potential immune responses may be augmented, intermittent, suppressed, or absent, as reviewed in Montgomery and Whittum-Hudson (1996) . Moreover, the magnitude of induced ocular immunity may be altered by the use of adjuvants (Peppard et al., 1988; Peppard and Montgomery, 1990) , cytokines (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991; Rafferty et al., 1996) , immunostimulatory DNA (Gill and Montgomery, 2002) , and microspheres (Rafferty et al., 1996; Ridley Lathers et al., 1998) and influenced by the concurrent state of systemic immunity (Waldman and Bergmann, 1987) .",

Direct antigen transfer across the conjunctival epithelium or countercurrent passage through the lacrimal duct appears to be severely restricted (Huang et al., 1989; Kahn et al., 1990; Sullivan et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the immunologic architecture of healthy lacrimal tissue appears to limit its capacity to effectively process and present antigen (Wieczorek et al., 1988) . With respect to conjunctival tissue, its role remains unclear. Consequently, it is possible that the ocular secretory immune response to infectious or toxic substances may require antigenic clearance through the nasolacrimal duct and stimulation of intranasal and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Consistent with this hypothesis are the following observations: (1) topical application of noninvasive antigens to the rat ocular surface appears to result in passage through the nasolacrimal canal into the gastrointestinal tract, and not retrograde transfer to the lacrimal gland or lymphatic drainage into local lymph nodes (Sullivan et al., 1998) . Similarly, herpes simplex virus in human tears has been shown to flow through the lacrimal canaliculi into the nasal cavity (Yoshida and Hondo, 1992) ;",

In contrast, the contribution of serum IgA antibodies to ocular surface defense appears to be minimal or nonexistent (Sullivan and Allansmith, 1984; Montgomery et al., 1984b; Bergmann et al., 1986; Peppard and Montgomery, 1987; Czerkinsky et al., 1987) . IgG antibodies from serum, though, may serve a significant role in certain inflammatory disorders of the eye (Gupta and Sarin, 1983; Mackie and Seal, 1984; Wilhelmus et al., 1986) . Overall, ocular immune protection may be conferred by both local and distant antigenic exposure, with lacrimal tissue acting as a recipient of committed IgA-containing cells that elaborate antigen-specific antibodies. However, the development of an optimal strategy to promote secretory immunity in the eye has yet to be established.",

Of interest, if pathologic alterations are evident in only one eye, immune responses may (Shani et al., 1985) or may not (Centifanto et al., 1989) occur in the contralateral, unaffected eye. With regard to contact lenses, these may bind (Gudmundsson et al., 1985) , and also cause modifications in the concentration of immune components in the tear film.

            "text": "In contrast, such conditions as IgA deficiency, ocular surgery, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, malnutrition, or autoimmune disease may often suppress ocular mucosal immunity. Thus, for example, pigmentary keratitis has been linked to tear S-IgA insufficiency (Fullard et al., 1995) , and severe malnutrition may lead to a significant decrease in tear IgA and SC concentrations, a diminished number of IgAcontaining cells in lacrimal tissue, and a blunted S-IgA antibody response to infectious challenge (Watson et al., 1985; Sullivan et al., 1990b) . Similarly, autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome may significantly alter or disrupt immune function in the eye. Multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of possible viral origin, is associated with heightened levels of monomeric IgA and lymphocytes and reduced amounts of SC in tears of afflicted individuals (Coyle, 1989 ). Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that occurs almost exclusively in females, is characterized by a progressive lymphocytic infiltration into the lacrimal gland, an immune-mediated destruction of lacrimal acinar and ductal epithelial cells, decreased tear IgA content, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Kincaid, 1987; Homma et al., 1994; Sullivan, 1994) . Furthermore, in experimental models of this complex disorder, the generation of autoantibodies (Ohashi et al., 1985) and autoreactive T cells to (Tsubata et al., 1996) , and the deposition of IgG, IgA, and complement in ductal epithelial cells of (deLuise et al., 1982) , lacrimal tissue may accompany the striking glandular inflammation (Jabs et al., 1985; Jabs and Prendergast, 1988; Tsubata et al., 1996; Takahashi et al., 1996; Robinson et al., 1998; van Blokland and Versnel, 2002) . The etiology of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome may involve the endocrine system (Ansar et al., 1985; Talal and Ahmed, 1985; Nelson and Steinberg, 1987; Ahmed et al., 1989; Homo-Delarche et al., 1991; Homo-Delarche and Durant, 1994; Sullivan, 1994 Sullivan, , 1997 but may also be due to primary infection by, and reactivation of, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus-6, hepatitis C, or retroviruses (Burns, 1983; Fox, 1988; Green et al., 1989; Krueger et al., 1990; Mariette et al., 1991; Fox et al., 1991; Pflugfelder et al., 1993; Mariette et al., 1993; Pepose et al., 1996) . These viruses have been identified in lacrimal and/or salivary tissues of Sj\u00f6gren's patients (Burns, 1983; Fox et al., 1986; Fox, 1988; Krueger et al., 1990; Garry et al., 1990; Mariette et al., 1991; Pflugfelder et al., 1993; Tsubota et al., 1995; Pepose et al., 1996) and may possibly stimulate the inappropriate, epithelial cell HLA-DR expression, T helper/inducer cell activation, B-cell hyperactivity, and autoantibody production evident in these affected tissues (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Maini, 1987; Fox, 1988; Homma et al., 1994) . In support of this possibility, certain viral infections in experimental animals exert a striking impact on the lacrimal gland and induce a periductular infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages, distinct nonsuppurative periductular inflammation, significant interstitial edema, widespread necrosis of the acinar and ductal epithelium, degenerative and atrophic alterations in epithelial cells, diminished tear flow, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Jacoby et al., 1975; Green et al., 1989) . Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that herpes viruses (i.e., cytomegalovirus) and coronaviruses (i.e., sialodacryoadenitis virus) may invade and replicate in rat lacrimal gland acinar cells Wickham et al., 1997) , EBV may bind to specific receptors in ductal epithelium of the human lacrimal gland (Levine et al., 1990) , and human immunodeficiency virus infection may predispose patients to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Couderc et al., 1987; Ulirsch and Jaffe, 1987; De Clerck et al., 1988; Lucca et al., 1990; Neves et al., 1994) . However, the precise role of viruses in the induction of autoimmune disease, as well as the mechanism by which viral infection may interfere with lacrimal gland function and immune expression, remains to be determined.",

The central nervous system can also regulate the immune system locally via the release of neuropeptides from peripheral nerves and by locally produced corticotrophin-releasing hormone (Levite, 2000; Elenkov et al., 2000) . Moreover, this neuroendocrine-immune interrelationship is bidirectional, and antigenic exposure may also induce the lymphocytic secretion of cytokines, hormones, and neuropeptides that directly modulate endocrine and neural function (Mulla and Buckingham, 1999; Besedovsky and del Rey, 2000) . In fact, it has been proposed that the immune system serves as a sensory organ, providing input to the endocrine and nervous compartments in response to noncognitive stimuli, such as infection (Blalock, 1984) . Consequently, an extensive, triangular association appears to exist between the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems that acts to promote and maintain homeostasis (Befus et al., 1999; Petrovsky, 2001; Eskandari and Sternberg, 2002; Webster et al., 2002) .",

However, although this neuroendocrine-immune interrelationship has been definitively shown in eyes of experimental animals, it has yet to be evaluated in humans. In rats, androgens elicit a marked increase in the production and secretion of SC by lacrimal gland acinar cells Kelleher et al., 1991; Lambert et al., 1994; Sullivan et al., 1998) , enhance the concentration of IgA in lacrimal tissue (Sullivan et al., 1998) , and stimulate the transfer and accumulation of SC and IgA, but not IgG, in tears (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997; Sullivan et al., 1998) . These hormone actions, which may be induced by various androgenic compounds (Sullivan et al., 1998) , are not duplicated by estrogen, progestin, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid treatment (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997; Sullivan et al. 1998) . Moreover, the immunologic effects of androgens appear to be unique to the eye, because androgen administration does not seem to influence IgA or SC levels in salivary, respiratory, intestinal, uterine, or bladder tissues (Sullivan et al., 1998) and actually suppresses mucosal immunity in the mammary gland (Weisz-Carrington et al., 1978) . The mechanism by which androgens regulate ocular SC dynamics may well involve hormone association with specific nuclear receptors in lacrimal gland acinar cells, binding of these androgen/receptor complexes to genomic acceptor sites, and the promotion of SC mRNA transcription and translation. In support of this hypothesis, saturable, highaffinity and androgen-specific receptors, which adhere to DNA, have been identified in lacrimal tissue (Ota et al., 1985; Sullivan et al., 1998) . In addition, androgens increase SC mRNA levels in lacrimal glands (Gao et al., 1995) . Androgen-induced SC production by acinar cells may be inhibited by androgen receptor (cyproterone acetate), transcription (actinomycin D), or translation (cycloheximide) antagonists (Lambert et al., 1994) . In contrast, the processes underlying androgen action on IgA in the rat eye, as well as this hormone's enhancement of tear IgA levels in the mouse (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997) , remain to be determined.",

            "text": "Androgen activity may also explain the pronounced, sexrelated differences in the rat ocular secretory immune system. Thus, the number of IgA-containing cells, and the IgA and SC output, are significantly greater in adult male lacrimal tissue, as compared with that of adult females. This sexual dimorphism also extends to tears, wherein from puberty to senescence, free SC and IgA, but not IgG, occur in considerably higher levels in male rats Sullivan et al., 1998) . Indeed, androgen influence may well be involved in the distinct sex-associated differences in the structural appearance, histochemistry, biochemistry, immunology, and molecular biologic expression of the lacrimal gland in a variety of species, including mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, and humans (Waterhouse, 1963; Cavallero, 1967; Hahn, 1969; Lauria and Porcelli, 1979; Cornell-Bell et al., 1985; Cripps et al., 1986; Sullivan and Allansmith, 1988; Hann et al., 1988; Pangerl et al., 1989; Mircheff et al., 1991; Azzarolo et al., 1993; Gao et al., 1995; Rocha et al., 1997; Sullivan et al., 1998; Marcozzi et al., 2000; Madia et al., 2001; Richards et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2002a) . With respect to humans, sex appears to influence the (1) degree of lymphocyte accumulation in the lacrimal gland (Waterhouse, 1963) ; (2) IgA concentrations in tears of adults (Sen et al., 1978) , but not the elderly (Sand et al., 1986) ; (3) the levels of TGF-\u03b1 and EGF in tears (van Setten and Schultz, 1994; Barton et al., 1998) ; and (4) frequency of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-related lacrimal gland immunopathology (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Kincaid, 1987; Fox, 1992; Homma et al., 1994; . Of interest, androgen administration to animal models of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (i.e., MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr and NZB/NZW F1 female mice) dramatically suppresses the inflammation in, and significantly stimulates the functional activity (e.g., IgA output) of, lacrimal tissue (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997; Sullivan et al. , 1998 . This hormone effect appears to be tissue specific and mediated through a hormone interaction with receptors in epithelial cell nuclei causing altered expression and/or activity of cytokines, proto-oncogenes, and apoptotic factors (i.e., TGF-\u03b21, IL-1 \u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, c-myb, bcl-2, and Bax) in the lacrimal gland Rocha et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "In addition to androgens, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis appears to play an important role in the expression of the rat ocular secretory immune system. Disruption of this axis by hypophysectomy or extirpation of the anterior pituitary significantly reduces the number of IgA plasma cells in lacrimal tissue, diminishes the acinar cell production of SC, causes a striking decrease in the levels of tear IgA and SC, and almost completely curtails androgen action on ocular mucosal immunity (Gao et al., 1995; Sullivan et al. 1998) . Moreover, this endocrine disturbance has a marked effect on lacrimal gland structure and function, leading to glandular atrophy, acinar cell contraction, nuclear pycnosis, cytoplasmic vacuolar metamorphosis, a decrease in tissue protein and mRNA content, and a decline in fluid and protein secretion (Azzarolo et al., 1992; Sullivan et al. 1998 ). The physiologic mechanisms responsible for hypothalamic-pituitary involvement in the ocular secretory immune system remain to be elucidated, but may include numerous neuroendocrine and immunologic pathways: the hypothalamus and pituitary regulate multiple endocrine circuits, directly influence neural innervation in the lacrimal gland, and clearly modulate immune activity (Berczi, 1990; Berczi and Nagy, 1990) . Furthermore, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is known to control many hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines that modify androgen and acinar cell function and control mucosal immunity (Mooradian et al., 1987; Sullivan et al. 1998) . Other studies in humans or experimental animals demonstrated that (1) sex steroids may significantly alter the development of allergic conjunctivitis in rabbits (Saruya, 1968) ; (2) diabetes may enhance the incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Ramos-Remus et al., 1994) and significantly diminish the expression of the secretory immune system of the eye, most likely related to the absence of insulin (Jackson and Hutson, 1984; Hann et al., 1991; Sullivan et al. 1998); and (3) both the thyroid and adrenal glands are essential to achieve the full magnitude of androgen-induced effects on the secretory immune system of the eye (Sullivan et al. 1998) .",

These neural agonists are known to control lymphocyte retention and/or function in other mucosal sites (Ottaway, 1984; Walcott et al., 1986; Stanisz et al., 1986; Freier et al., 1987; Hart et al., 1990; D'Orisio and Panerai, 1990; Bienenstock, 1993; Homo-Delarche and Durant, 1994; Chrousos, 1995; Wilder, 1995; Besedovsky and del Rey, 1996) , and their release may well influence the adherence, distribution, or activity of IgA plasma cells, T cells, or mast cells in the lacrimal gland (Franklin et al., 1988; Oeschger et al., 1989; Franklin et al., 1989; Williams et al., 1994) . Consistent with this possibility, VIP appears to augment T-cell attachment to murine lacrimal tissue (Oeschger et al., 1989) , and systemic administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, practolol, suppresses human tear IgA levels (Garner and Rahi, 1976) . However, the nature of the sympatheticimmune interaction requires further clarification because ocular application of the \u03b2-blocker, timolol, to humans, and sympathetic denervation in rats (Sullivan et al., 1990a) had no apparent effect on tear IgA content.",

In support of this hypothesis, VIP and adrenergic agents are known to enhance the generation of cellular cyclic AMP (Mauduit et al., 1984; Dartt, 1989 Dartt, , 1992 . Furthermore, exposure of lacrimal gland acinar cells to cyclic AMP analogues, cyclic AMP inducers (i.e., PGE 2 and cholera toxin), or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may elevate SC production . This cAMP influence on SC elaboration, although pronounced in the lacrimal gland, is not necessarily reproduced in other mucosal epithelial cells (Lambert et al., 1994) . Of interest, cAMP and cGMP both appear to increase S-IgA output by human main and accessory lacrimal glands in vitro (Hunt et al., 1996) . The mechanism underlying this cGMP action, though, is unclear, given that this compound has no effect on SC production by rat lacrimal gland acinar cells .",

Moreover, although the optic nerve does not appear to regulate the ocular secretory immune system (Sullivan et al., 1990a) , light does seem to control anterior chamber-associated immune deviation , herpes virus-related retinitis , and various parameters of systemic immunity (Maestroni et al., 1987) . The mucosal immune system of the eye in experimental animals may also be regulated by cytokines. For example, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6 or IFN\u03b3, stimulate the acinar cell synthesis and secretion of SC . The regulatory effect of TNF-\u03b1 on acinar cell SC is similar to that found in colonic cell lines, wherein TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and IL-1 increase the production, surface expression, and release of SC (Kvale et al., 1988) . However, the absence of IFN\u03b3 activity on SC output by acinar cells is notable, in that this cytokine regulates SC dynamics in both intestinal (Sollid et al., 1987; Kvale et al., 1988; Nilsen et al., 1999; Blanch et al., 1999) and uterine (Wira and Prabhala, 1993) epithelial cells and may influence lacrimal gland acinar cell secretion (Lambert, 1998) . Although IL-6 appears to have no influence on lacrimal SC production , both IL-6 and IL-5 stimulate the synthesis of IgA in lacrimal tissue explants (Pockley and Montgomery, 1990b) and in combination augment the secondary tear IgA antibody response to pneumococcal antigen (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991) and suppress IgG and IgM synthesis in lacrimal tissue (Pockley and Montgomery, 1990a) . Similarly, TGF-\u03b2 enhances IgA output from rat lacrimal tissue, whether alone or in combination with IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, or IL-5 plus IL-6 (Rafferty and . However, TGF-\u03b2 or IL-4 also inhibit lymphocyte binding to lacrimal gland acinar epithelium (Elfaki et al., 1994) .",
