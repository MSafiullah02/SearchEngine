            "text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a purported endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), used to make plastics, receipts, food packaging and other products (Vandenberg et al., 2009). Because BPA is a public health concern, restriction and legislation of BPA have been suggested worldwide. Recently, BPA regulation has been tightened due to the potential for continuous exposure and health hazards during fetal and neonatal life (Eladak et al., 2015). For example, BPA was banned in baby bottles in Canada in 2010, in the European Union and in China in 2011 so the industry has sought alternative chemicals. Due to removal of BPA from consumer products, bisphenol analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) have been used in \u201cBPA-free\u201d products. BPS is used for various industrial applications including polymer production and thermal papers (Ben-Jonathan and Hugo, 2016, Liao et al., 2012) and polyethersulfone plastics used to make baby bottles (National Toxicology Program (NTP) Research Concept, https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/about_ntp/bsc/2014/june/bisphenols_concept_508.pdf). BPF is used in epoxy resins used to line food cans and in polymer plastics (Liao and Kannan, 2013). BPS and BPF have been identified everyday household products, environmental compartments, and human specimens (Chen et al., 2016). In natural environments, BPS and BPF appear to have moderate persistence and are more resistant to degradation than BPA (Danzl et al., 2009, Ike et al., 2006). In some Asian rivers and lakes, BPF and BPS can be at the highest level of 2.8 and 7.2 \u03bcg/L, respectively (Yamazaki et al., 2015). However, compared to BPA, there is limited information about their toxicological effects in aquatic organisms.",

Previous studies suggest multiple physiological alterations occur in offspring exposed to environmental toxicants such as EDCs through the blood or germ line of parents (Schwindt, 2015), so there may be generational consequences of these toxicants. Although reported adverse effects of bisphenol analogs on multiple biological processes including growth, metabolism, and endocrine system function in aquatic organisms have been documented (Kang et al., 2007), transgenerational effects in aquatic wildlife are poorly understood. Transgenerational inheritance of BPA effects have been studied in human and mammals (Schonfelder et al., 2002, Takahashi and Oishi, 2000). Therefore, transgenerational consequences of parental bisphenol analog exposure may exist for aquatic organisms.",

Because the innate immune system is an initial defense against invading pathogens and is a prerequisite for potentiating the adaptive immune response (Segner et al., 2011), disturbance of this system by environmental toxicants may negatively influence host defense against infections and affect individual or population health. Previous studies suggest that EDCs including BPA can disrupt immune systems of aquatic animals (Milla et al., 2011). Additionally, growth and development, and disease and survival of organisms are partly determined by immune capacity. Therefore, whether exposure to environmental toxicants by parents alters offspring immunity is of interest. In mammals, transmaternal BPA exposure affected the development of immune organs in mice offspring (Yang et al., 2008), decreasing immune defense and increasing the risk of disease (Bodin et al., 2014). However, whether exposure to parental BPA and its analogs induces immunotoxicological changes in aquatic offspring is not clear.",

Thus, we evaluated immunological effects of low concentrations of BPA and its analogs\u2014BPS and BPF\u2014on zebrafish offspring exposed over their whole life cycle. Then, we used a disease challenge to assess the integrated immune system response and measured gene expression for those genes responsible for eliminating invading pathogens. We selected the following genes that are expressed exclusively in the immune system: toll-like receptors (TLRs) and downstream signaling molecule mRNA such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), inflammatory cytokines including type I interferon (IFN), myxovirus-resistance gene (Mx), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (Li et al., 2017, Liao et al., 2016, Medzhitov, 2001). Oxidative defense is involved in immune response (Biller-Takahashi et al., 2015), so myeloperoxidase (MPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA expression was measured. Recombination-activating genes (RAGs) in immature T and B lymphocytes were also measured. Lysozyme activity and respiratory burst are common used as sensitive biomarkers for immunotoxicity (Nayak et al., 2007).",

F0 generation fish were exposed to BPA, BPS and BPF throughout their whole life span, and their offspring (F1 generation) were used for subsequent experiments. Waterborne BPA, BPS and BPF exposure of F0 fish began at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) (Fig. 1\n). Briefly, 24 hpf embryos were randomly distributed into 90 mm petri dishes and exposed to BPA (0.1, 1, 10 \u03bcg/L), BPS (10 \u03bcg/L), and BPF (10 \u03bcg/L) in triplicate at each nominal concentration. Controls received 0.01% DMSO (v/v). Each dish contained 100 embryos. Bisphenol concentrations were selected according to previous studies (Qiu et al., 2016b, Wu et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2013) and environmental abundance in aquatic environments (Yamazaki et al., 2015). After 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), larvae were transferred to 2 L glass containers. As fish grew, culture containers were adjusted from a 15 L sized tank (15\u201330 dpf) at a density of 5 fish/L, to a 30 L sized tank (31\u201390 dpf) at a density of 2 fish/L, to a 30 L sized tank (91\u2013180 dpf) at a density of 1 fish/L. After 180 days of exposure, fish were paired (2 females for every 1 male) and a clutch of embryos was obtained from each treatment group. F1 embryos received continued treatment with BPA, BPS or BPF at concentrations used to treat parents or they were not treated at all until 72 hpf.",

In fish, lysozyme is one of the most important maternally-transferred immune factors functioning in the defense of teleost larvae against pathogens (Swain and Nayak, 2009). However, lysozyme activity has been shown to vary depending on changes of environmental factors or stressors, such as aquatic toxicants (Bols et al., 2001, Saurabh and Sahoo, 2008). Fish are the sensitive aquatic organisms and show a wide range of responses even towards minor changes in their environment. Therefore, stimulation or inhibition of lysozyme activity in fish can be used to monitor environmental hazards and fish innate immunity. In adults, cadmium administered to rainbow trout (Sanchez-Dardon et al., 1999) increased serum lysozyme activity and reduced serum lysozyme activity was noted in Korean rockfish after exposure to synthetic pyrethroids (Jee et al., 2005).",

Although serum lysozyme activity in adult zebrafish was not assayed previous work suggests that low concentrations of BPA increase serum lysozyme activity in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Qiu et al., 2016a). For F1 larvae not exposed to bisphenol, slight or significant increases in lysozyme activity and gene expression were noted, indicating maternal transfer of increased lysozymes to offspring perhaps due to maternal induction after exposure. Alternately, bacterial infection can induce lysozyme activity in fish (Saurabh and Sahoo, 2008). Similarly, lysozyme activity and gene expression were significantly up-regulated in F1 control larvae after PAM3CSK4 exposure. However, no significant changes were observed in F1 larvae exposed to PAM3CSK4 compared with those that did not have continued bisphenols exposure. Thus, parental exposure to bisphenols may increase lysozyme activity and disrupt immunity in developing offspring.",

Because of the complexity of the pathway, the TLR signaling pathway is categorized into MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). The MyD88-dependent pathway is used by all TLRs except TLR3, whereas TLR3 initiate the TRIF-dependent pathway. Previous work showed that knockdown of MyD88 mRNA disrupting clearance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium Ra bacteria in zebrafish (van der Sar et al., 2006); and another study showed that mice deficient in TLR3 and TRIF were highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, and had more weight loss, more mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers (Totura et al., 2015). In the present study, with decreased TLR2 and TLR3 expression, parental exposure to bisphenols also resulted in down-regulating MyD88 and TRIF expression and decreasing survival of F1 larvae. These findings suggest an importance of the TLR signaling pathway for generating a balanced protective innate immune response to bacterial or virus infections, and our results indicate that parental exposure to bisphenols decreased immune defense via inhibiting TLR-associated gene expression in the TLR pathway.",

Important antibacterial cytokines include TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, whereas antiviral cytokines include the type I IFNs. TNF\u03b1 is released by activated macrophages, T lymphocytes and other immune cells in response to various infectious stimuli and can be induced by bacterial acting through TLR2, whereas IL-1\u03b2 activates neutrophils and macrophages and is reported to be crucial to the clearance of intracellular bacteria (Kawai and Akira, 2011, Nayak et al., 2007). Type I IFNs are produced by many immune cells type in response to viral infection and can be induced by the Poly I:C; Mx is an interferon-inducible gene, enabling indirect measurements of type I IFNs activities in zebrafish (Sullivan and Kim, 2008). Therefore, alterations in expression patterns of these cytokines indicate that parental exposure to bisphenols immunosuppresses F1 larvae. Prenatal exposure to BPA is shown to be associated with TLR-induced cytokine suppression, such as TNF\u03b1, in neonates (Liao et al., 2016). High pathogen load, coupled with reductions in important antibacterial and antiviral cytokines, as was modeled here, using bisphenols and zebrafish, may blunt offspring immunity and prevent a competent immune response vital for eradicating infection. In addition, the bioaccumulation and metabolism of environmental chemicals in organisms may be a mechanism of immunotoxicity. For example, endosulfan can accumulate in fish immune organs and induce leucocytopenia, headkidney leucocytes death and alters headkidney somatic index (Kumari et al., 2016). In the present study, BPA and its analogs accumulate slightly in F1 embryos through parent transfer decreasing inflammatory cytokines expression. However, further study is needed to reveal the cell viability affected by bisphenols accumulation in F1 embryos.",

Also, MMP9 expression is induced after L. monocytogenes infection and enhances macrophage migration in zebrafish embryos (Shan et al., 2016). Similarly, MMP13 was induced in channel catfish after bacterial infection (Jiang et al., 2010). In addition, MMPs contributes to embryonic development. Previous studies suggest that up-regulation of MMP9 and MMP13 expressions in zebrafish larvae occurs after tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) exposure, suggesting that alteration of MMPs expression may contribute to developmental lesions in zebrafish (McCormick et al., 2010). However, we found no significant malformation in F1 larvae without bisphenol exposure compared with controls so MMPs may act on the innate immune system in F1 larvae, and alterations in expression of MMPs after parental exposure to bisphenols may cause immune disruption in F1 larvae.",
