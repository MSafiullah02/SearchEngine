Although this was not realized, large gaps in capacity to meet potential emergency health demands were revealed.1\n",

For a complete listing of these reports, see Supplementary data in Appendix A. Manifest content analysis was used to analyze the use of the terms \u201ccapacity\u201d and \u201ccapacities\u201d related to public health.5 Tables of contents, chapter headings, executive summaries, recommendations and terms that were unrelated to public health (e.g. bed capacity) were excluded. The remaining terms were coded by report name and type of capacity by LEW. For example, epidemiological capacity was coded as \u201cepidemiological\u201d. All coding was independently reviewed by SEG. Disagreements between reviewers related to the addition, deletion and naming of codings (n = 90) were discussed and consensus was achieved. Similar codes were deductively organized by LEW into families that represented separate components of public health capacity. Families and their codes were reviewed by SEG and consensus was achieved through critical discussion. These families were then organized by LEW and AP into a tiered public health capacity framework where capacity within each tier builds upon the capacities within the preceding tiers, and moves from the individual to the systems level. Here, we present this framework of public health capacity that identifies individual components and suggests how they relate to and support one another for the purpose of enhancing overall capacity in public health systems.",

Population health management refers to meeting community needs and responding to public health issues and challenges within the local and provincial public health systems. Delivery of programs and services is primarily discussed in relation to Ontario's public health units although the need for human, physical and financial resources applies to public health organizations as well. Governance is related to policy and planning procedures, strategic capacity, leadership and management, performance management, and risk assessment and planning. These complex capacity components require the integration of the lower-tiered capacity components to impact local, provincial and federal public health capacity.",

This is in contrast to other discussions of capacity in public health that have a more singular focus on specific capacities such as epidemiology or health promotion.9, 10 Based on this framework, capacity-building efforts are predicted to be potentially more impactful when directed at the lower tiers (human resources, foundation) as these tiers support capacity within the above tiers.",

We suggest that this framework can be applied by each actor using an iterative, developmental approach according to the following steps: 1) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems should possess given their particular mandate; 2) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems possess, and examine how these components relate to the other capacity components in the framework; 3) Identify the components that individuals, agencies, and systems do not currently possess in relation to the ideal state; and 4) Examine the potential for building these capacities internally or externally via strategic partnerships with other actors who already possess these desired capacities. This conceptual framework provides a common structure of public health capacity components that can be utilized by any actor to better coordinate and target capacity-building efforts to specific components identified using the framework.",

Certain components such as maternal and child health were not addressed in these reports and are therefore not included in this framework.
