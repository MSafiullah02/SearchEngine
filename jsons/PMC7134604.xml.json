From January 1998 to September 2003, the Chinese government invested 380 billion Yuan (US$46 billion) in urban and rural electricity market development [1]. Its goal was to stimulate domestic demand and push economic development in China, given that about 950 million people (75% of the country\u2019s population) are living in rural areas.",

We grouped the provinces according to their economic and geographical conditions. Jiangsu and Liaoning were selected and grouped together because (1) they both have good economic development conditions in rural areas; and (2) they are both located in the eastern coastal area. Liaoning is in northeast and Jiangsu in east China. These two provinces represent China\u2019s well-developed areas. Hebei and Henan, located in central China, are grouped together to represent China\u2019s mid-developed provinces. Finally, Xinjiang and Shannxi, located in the western region of China, represent China\u2019s least developed provinces. These three groups will also represent six electricity markets that the Chinese government plans to establish for power retail competition by 2005. We forecast electricity demand in the rural areas of the six provinces and tried to identify the best investment market in terms of high growth rate of electricity demand and greatest impact on rural electrification and economic development.",

Private sectors have little incentive to participate in rural electricity market development. Instead, governments should initiate and/or invest in rural electricity development programs.(ii)The main objectives of the government in rural electricity market development include poverty reduction, rural economic development, sustainable development in rural areas, and mitigating the migration from countryside to city.\n",

In 2003, the demand exceeded the supply and 18 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (including Shanxi, Jiangsu and Shanghai) faced severe power shortages last summer that affected local economic and social development, particularly rural households\u2019 daily lives [5]. The Commission attributed the shortages mainly to (i) the lack of electricity market analysis, (ii) incorrect power demand forecasting, (iii) the slow investment in power supply, (iv) climate change (hot summer), and (v) higher production by enterprises after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. China\u2019s policy makers are pondering responsive market strategies, hoping to accelerate electricity facility construction and balance power supply and demand by \u201cbreaking monopoly and introducing competition\u201d during the coming years.",

These comprise: north, northeast, east, west, central and south electricity markets. When established, the markets will be able to support a power plant to sell electricity within the local market as well as export to other markets as long as the transmission line capacities are sufficient. Similarly, an end-user will be able to choose a power supplier either inside or outside of his own market system. This is called a \u201cFull Retail Competition Market\u201d in China.

However, progress in theory and practice was slow during the initial period. It was not until the 1980s that the theoretical study of medium-to-long-term electricity demand forecasting began. A series of forecasting methods, such as top\u2013down econometric modeling and bottom\u2013up end-use accounting modeling, was successively developed and widely accepted in the electricity demand forecasting of power systems [7]. Having reviewed the literature of energy modeling, Lin made an analysis of energy demand forecasting for China by using an econometric model. The article states that econometric models using GDP and electricity tariff as main driving variables may have at least one disadvantage. Since the economic variables employed in the econometric model are likely to be endogenous, estimating electricity demand by a single equation may produce simultaneous bias and lead to unreliable forecasts. There could be many other factors that require proper attention in determining electricity demand in China\u2019s rural area. An important one, for example, is the climate. Dry climate in a year means that more electricity is needed for irrigation. Cold or gloomy days mean that more electricity will be generally used for heating and lighting. Electricity demand also varies according to the time of day. Therefore, the demand for electricity in rural areas depends on climate changes and peak demands during cold and hot seasons. However, it is difficult to incorporate such climate change factors in an econometric model.",

However, since it was a newly developed sector, its share in the total electricity consumption was relatively small, less than 7% in 2000.(ii)The household sector had the second highest average growth rate (17.60%) and a significant market share (17.70%) in 2000. The total households consumed 9081 GW h of electricity in that year.(iii)County level industry was the largest electricity consumer in 1978 with a share of 61.00%. Due to a structural change, its share has decreased over the past two decades. By 2000, this figure was 37.60%. However, the electricity consumption was increasing at an average rate of 7.60%.(iv)TVEs increased electricity consumption both in quantity and in share. Electricity use increased from 606 GW h in 1978 to 15,381 GW h in 2000, with an annual growth rate of 15.80%.(v)Electricity consumed by agriculture had the least annual growth rate (5.20% only); hence its share decreased from 25.50% in 1978 to 9.50% in 2000. This might have been caused by good climate conditions for farming, urbanization and industrialization in rural areas.(vi)Total electricity consumption in Jiangsu increased 7.1 times from about 6545 GW h in 1978 to 53,120 GW h in 2000, with an annual average growth rate of 10.00%.\n",

The analysis for the five provinces followed the same procedure as that of Jiangsu. Tables A.3\u2013A.8 presents the main results of the electricity market analysis and are summarized as follows:(i)The electricity market shares in Liaoning are as follows: agriculture increasing from 9.00% in 2000 to 10.70% in 2005 and 12.50% in 2010, and all other sectors decreasing slightly over the next 5\u201310 years. The agriculture and county industry sectors will be the largest electricity consumers in the coming 5\u201310 years with total electricity consumption of 3604 and 10,214 GW h in 2010, respectively. The household sector maintained almost the same growth rate for the period 1995\u20132000, at about 3% in 2001\u20132005. This rate would drive electricity demand by household up to 5996 GW h in 2005. Electricity consumption by other sectors, increasing at the rate of about 3% between 2001 and 2005, would be 1781 GW h in 2005. When the above elements are taken into consideration, electricity demand in Liaoning will increase from 20,184 GW h in 2000 to 23,942 GW h in 2005 and to 28,785 GW h in 2010.(ii)In Hebei, the research results show that the market shares of agricultural and households would augment over the next 5\u201310 years. Electricity demand in these two sectors would be 11,464 GW h for agriculture, 11,322 GW h for household in 2005, 17,113 GW h for agriculture and 16,752 GW h for household in 2010, respectively. TVE might need moderate electricity growth over the next 5 years and the quantity would be 9153 GW h in 2005. The county industry sector is projected to increase electricity demand by 7.10% each year over the next few years. This would double electricity consumption from 1995 to 2005. Electricity demand in other sectors may continue to increase slowly due to a decrease in intensity and market share. The total electricity consumption could grow at a rate of 8.34% per year from 2000 to 2005, reaching 49,644 GW h in 2005.(iii)Electricity consumption in Henan for the period 2001\u20132005 would almost keep the same growth rates as in the period 1995\u20132000. County industry is the largest electricity consumer with 17,553 GW h in 2005, although its market share may decrease from 46.60% in 2000 to 44.30% in 2005. Household and other sectors will have the highest annual growth rates and both will increase their shares in the coming 5\u201310 years. Electricity consumption in Henan rural areas will total 39,658 GW h in 2005 and 50,162 GW h in 2010, increasing by about 4.81% each year.(iv)The electricity market shares in Shaanxi during 2000\u20132010 will be as follows: stable in TVEs and other sectors, decreasing in agriculture, but increasing in household. Electricity consumption in 2005 may be 2075 GW h for agriculture with annual growth rate of 0.8%, 4022 GW h for TVEs with the rate of 10.30%, 3982 GW h for county industry with 7.60%, 3837 GW h for household with 10.20%, and 1940 GW h for other sectors with a yearly growth rate of 11.60%. The total electricity demand will amount to 15,856 GW h in 2005 and 22,014 GW h in 2010 in Shaanxi rural areas.(v)In Xinjiang, the electricity growth rates in all sectors increased at high rates during 1995\u20132000. This high consumption trend might continue in the next 2 years and with a moderate growth rate in the years to follow4\n. According to our analysis, county industry in Xinjiang will be the main marginal consumer of electricity with share growth increasing from 22.90% in 1995 to 45.00% in 2005. Electricity consumption by other sectors will continue to decrease between 1995 and 2005. The household sector share will decrease from 15.10% in 2000 to 13.30% in 2005. The total volume of the electricity market will increase from 6222 GW h in 2000 to 9318 GW h in 2005 at an annual rate of 8.41% ranking the highest in growth rate of all the provinces. In 2010, 12,571 GW h of electricity will be required for all of the sectors.\n",

However, data shortage is one of the main limitations in China. Household business income and county industry output, for example, are not statistically available. We had to estimate the data. In addition, due to the reform of the statistical system and a change in methodology, some historical data are not consistent throughout the history. For example, the statistical methodology for rural population and economic sectors in Liaoning has been changed in the early 1990s. Many people living in rural areas have been statistically treated as urban residents. As a result, the rural population according to the Chinese official statistical data has been decreasing very quickly. By 1999, there were about 4.3 million people in Liaoning\u2019s rural areas. This figure may not be true. As another example, energy consumption by county small industries has been statistically presented in the industry sector.
