            "text": "Background: Tuberculosis (TB) control programmes rely heavily on laboratories to support both clinical care and public health. Qualified personnel with adequate technical and managerial skills comprise an integral component of any quality assured laboratory. Training a new generation of TB laboratory specialists was identified as a critical priority in the European Union /European Economic Area (EU/EEA). A tailored training programme for TB reference laboratory professionals was developed and implemented within the European Reference Laboratory Network for Tuberculosis to increase the pool of technical experts available to step into leadership roles in the TB laboratory community. Three cohorts of selected laboratory specialists participated in a series of trainings from 2009 to 2016. Methods: We conducted an evaluation of the training programme using a structured questionnaire administered via the EUSurvey website, with the aim of documenting the benefits and contribution as well as suggesting improvements and future direction of the programme. All graduated participants and all current ERLTB-Net members were invited to participate in the online survey and descriptive quantitative analysis was performed. Results: The evaluation found significant benefits for both the participants and the participants' institutions, with improvements being reported in laboratory practices and management including implementation of new diagnostic techniques and career progression for participants. The training programme differed from other international and European initiatives in a number of important ways; the curriculum is unique in the scope and range of topics covered; the programme targets senior level professionals and future directors; cohorts were limited to 8-10 participants; and the programme involved a number of workshops (5-7) taking place over a two-year period. Relationships and collaborations established between individuals and institutions were valued as an important success of the initiative. Suggestions on how the impact of the programme could be enhanced included equipping participants to perform laboratory assessments in low-resource settings outside the EU, thus bolstering global TB control. Conclusion: Based on the findings presented the training programme has proved to be successful in developing leadership, expertise, partnerships and networks to support TB laboratories and has contributed significant benefits to strengthening European National Reference laboratories in the fight against TB.",

In 2019, an estimated 10 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died from the disease worldwide, including 251,000 deaths among persons living with HIV [2] . Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) caused by bacilli resistant to at least two key antimicrobials (rifampicin and isoniazid) remains an emerging public health challenge globally [3, 4] . Accurate results from TB diagnostics and drug susceptibility tests enable TB programmes to identify TB cases and select appropriate treatment. Therefore, laboratories play a critical role in TB control both in supporting clinical care and public health activities: detecting active TB cases, monitoring treatment, contributing to outbreak investigations, contact tracing and surveillance activities [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

The Stop TB Partnership's Global Laboratory Initiative (GLI) [12, 13] developed a training package for TB diagnostic network planning which is predominantly administered through an online portal. This does not provide dedicated in-person practical training, which is vital for development of leadership and management skills, as well as for gaining expertise in conducting assessment visits. Another training offered by the European TB Laboratory Initiative (ELI) offers regional workshops that bring together laboratory specialists from countries with high TB and MDR-TB rates to strengthen their technical capacity in TB and MDR-TB diagnosis and implementing biosafety measures [14] . While these initiatives support the implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) End-TB strategy [15] they do not specifically target the needs of senior level staff and laboratory managers serving as TB laboratory specialists in the EU/EEA. Thus, training of a new cadre of mycobacterial laboratory specialists was identified as an urgent requirement in the EU TB laboratory network [5, 16] .",

The ERLTB-Net training programme aimed to increase the pool of technical experts with advanced knowledge of TB diagnostic methods, available to take leadership roles in national TB laboratories, and to support national TB laboratory systems and the EU/ EEA TB diagnostic community. The curriculum for the training programme was developed by a group of TB experts experienced in providing advanced level training based on needs identified through External Quality Assessment (EQA) rounds [11] and decisions made at ERLTB-Net annual meetings. Between 2009 and 2016, the programme was provided to 22 laboratory specialists divided into three cohorts. All participants were subjected to a rigorous selection process. Trainees were first nominated by ERLTB-Net laboratories who selected them based on specific criteria including their work experience, level of seniority in their current position as well as potential benefits for the supporting laboratory. As potential candidates they then had to submit a portfolio including a CV and motivation letter highlighting their relevant experience and suitability as a trainee. Following shortlisting by the ERLTB-Net senior selection panel, participants were interviewed to confirm suitability before being enrolled as trainees.",

Large trainings were combined with annual ERLTB-Net meetings and provided opportunities for developing networks, leadership, management and training skills through direct involvement of trainees in the meeting organization, teaching and discussions. Topics for large trainings included laboratory operations, TB policies and guidelines, laboratory financial management as well as emerging technologies in TB laboratory diagnosis.

The ultimate goal of the training programme was to increase the pool of technical experts available to step into leadership roles in national TB laboratories and in the EU/EEA international TB diagnostic community. The course specifically targeted future leaders in TB diagnostics in the European region, therefore recruited those likely to take up management and leadership positions in TB laboratories within the EU, to achieve optimal impact. A total of 21 persons were trained within this programme in 2009-2016 and many of them subsequently took up leadership roles in TB laboratories. A high proportion of training participants reported having been promoted to more senior positions nationally and internationally following their graduation, indicating that the training program was beneficial for their career progression and fulfilling one of the fundamental objectives of the training programme. Satisfaction with the training programme was generally high and self-reported achievements exceeded initial expectations in the vast majority of categories, indicating significant perceived benefits for the trainees. Practical training was the only area where expectations were high but gains were relatively low (Fig. 1) which could be explained by the fact that the advanced training covered various aspects of which hands on training was just one component. Inclusion of multiple components spanning theory and practice, combined with leadership and management aspects, allowed trainees to gain a broader expertise which is demonstrated by significant gains in other areas.",

Our findings demonstrate the critical opportunities available for more advanced NRL's and SNRL's in the European region to share their experiences and support development of those operating in low-resource contexts through missions and collaborations. Furthermore, an important objective of this training programme was to harmonize diagnostic methodologies across the European region. Various new methods, policies and practices have been implemented in participants' home institutions following graduation, achieving a key goal of the programme. Recently Mathys et al.

            "text": "It is widely accepted that to help ensure that laboratories can effectively play their critical role in the detection, prevention and control of diseases, laboratory directors and senior laboratory managers require specialised training in leadership and management. To achieve this, in 2020, WHO expect to launch a new training programme the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP) which is anticipated to greatly contribute to the laboratory profession globally. However, the content and teaching modalities are still under development and it is unclear if the programme will be administered in person or through distance learning [24] . While there are currently a number of other training initiatives available to support capacity building of laboratory staff, the ERLTB-Net training programme which has been running for more than a decade, differs from those available in a number of important ways [13, 14] . Firstly, the training curriculum is unique in the scope and range of topics covered within the programme which includes education on TB policy and guidelines; management, leadership and organisation of TB laboratories; technical training on new methodologies, as well as QMS and biosafety issues. Secondly, the programme is pitched at a very high level, targeting future directors and senior level professionals in TB diagnostics in the European region, which has been identified as a critical need in the EU/EEA area. The requirement for training of senior TB experts was further supported by the results of a recent survey (ERLTB-Net, unpublished data) demonstrating that 32.0% and 61.3% of senior technicians and heads of national TB reference laboratories in EU/EEA countries are approaching retirement age (50 years +) or are above retirement age. In countries that joined the EU in 2004 and later these proportions are even higher (42.1% and 63.6%, respectively). The recruitment process for this training involved careful selection of participants based on their long-term commitments, qualifications and nominations from host institutions, prioritising laboratory experts already working in NRLs and SNRLs. Thirdly, training cohorts are purposely limited in number with only eight to ten participants per cohort facilitating targeted training, fostering relationships and encouraging collaborations to be built over the period of the training. Finally, the programme took place at a number of venues within the EU (UK and Italy), with trainees participating in a number of small and large workshops spread over the two-year period. This longitudinal nature of training (as opposed to one off training offered by many initiatives) further facilitated network and relationship building, resulting in collaborations and partnerships developing, with many subsequent positive outcomes.",
