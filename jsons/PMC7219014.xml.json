Yet, both medications have been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction as well. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been described to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into target cells expressed by the epithelial cells of the lung, leading to vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects [1]. This vasoconstriction may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Dysregulation or loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is suspected in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well [2-3].",

Large health systems may be in a unique position to help advance knowledge on this subject matter by conducting a more robust retrospective review. If clinical researchers therein would peruse electronic medical records (EMR) for similar outcomes, as described in this paper, that can aid in gaining a better understanding of the role that CCBs may have in mitigating disease. Particular attention may be paid, where possible, on patient adherence to outpatient medication regimens prior to acute hospitalization. For example, if the rates of hospitalization for patients that were adherent to CCBs were decreased, that might indicate preventative benefits. This could potentially explain significant differences of clinical data at the initial presentation described above, but this remains to be investigated.

Avoiding intubation with the utilization of potential countermeasures, such as with CCBs and other vasodilators described below, can be considered and evaluated since they may aid in the achievement of improved outcomes. When precisely during the course of the illness (early vs. late) these medications may be most effective may also be examined. Furthermore, perhaps beneficial effects of CCBs and other vasodilators described below can be extended to patients that are already mechanically ventilated. Clinical studies may investigate if successful weaning from mechanical ventilation is promoted by the use of vasodilators.

In other words, flow (or micro-perfusion) via the alveolar-capillary unit may be slowly but surely decreasing as a result of a vicious cycle wherein inflammation secondary to viral injury begets hypercoagulability as well as the impedance of blood flow. Clot formation certainly lulls or wholly undermines segments of previously oxygenating pathways passing through the alveolar-capillary unit. Moreover, inflammation by itself, enhanced by the recruitment of cytokines, leukocytes, and the whole gamut of caustic endogenous mechanisms, may further render viable tissue non-functional. Additionally, with inflammation comes fluid or edema formation - this also compromises oxygen diffusion. On top of all this exists the innate disposition or tendency for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction [15]. Perhaps, vascular inflammation also contributes to elicit reactive vasoconstriction independently. Altogether, a microvascular process may be occurring over numerous alveolar-capillary units, which yields a macro result. In sum, with increasing hypoxia and respiratory failure, the following challenges are faced and each promotes the other perhaps in sequence but not necessarily: (1) Viral injury provoking inflammation, (2) recruitment of an Immune response, (3) fluid accumulation, (4) vasoconstriction or compromised vascular flow, and (5) hypercoagulability and clot formation.",

Generally, in patients that have stable blood pressure, no significant clinical signs of dehydration, and crackles on auscultation, conservative fluid management seems to be best. Ground-glass opacities present on imaging may be reflective of fluid collection as well. In these cases, avoiding intravenous fluid hydration and relegating to oral fluid intake as needed may decrease the risk of excess fluid accrual in the lungs. This approach is not feasible in many clinical situations such as where co-morbid diabetic ketoacidosis, severe dehydration, hypernatremia, or Rhabdomyolysis occurs. Nonetheless, oxygenation impedance as a result of edema formation is still worth taking into account in clinical management over an extended course of hospitalization. On the other hand, patients that are dehydrated from the outset or were previously on anti-coagulation prior to presentation and perhaps taking a CCB may have relatively clear sounding lungs on auscultation - this is a clinical observation. Those previously taking anti-coagulation and/or a CCB might possibly be less prone to fluid accumulation given preemptive counters to the impedance of flow and clot formation. This may be analogous to a pipe wherein, if flow is preserved, fluid may pass without interference. However, if it is clogged then certainly running more water will rebound and not successfully traverse the pipe without backing up or collecting proximally. In the former, where significant interference is not present, fluid may be a boon to expedite the clearance of inflammation. In the latter, where viral triggers of inflammation, down the five-step theoretical pathogenesis described above, have already exerted influence, it may worsen clinical status. The \"pipe\" analogy should be further qualified since, in our case, vascular channels may not be intact, as endothelial injury and capillary permeability are both likely. Moreover, inflammation in itself is prone to fluid accumulation as seen in patients with bowel wall edema following surgery, ascites in cancer, or serositis. Yet, while abdominal fluid accumulation may be a cause for significant discomfort, even mild pulmonary edema development may swiftly compromise oxygenation.",

Patients that are otherwise stable but requiring oxygen supplementation to maintain a stable saturation level may improve with a vasodilator such as nifedipine or amlodipine (maximizing the dose to achieve ideal blood pressure may be of interest), prophylactic anti-coagulation, steroids, antibiotics and antiviral therapy alone without the use of a diuretic agent. Yet, if the clinical disease progresses and suspicion of need for invasive ventilation emerges, a diuretic such as acetazolamide may be considered. In ventilated patients, acetazolamide may be a key to promote weaning as described above. Frequent and repeated doses of acetazolamide may be necessary since the inflammatory effects of the viral provocation, as well as capillary permeability, will not vanish instantaneously and following a brief course of treatment re-accumulation of fluid may materialize. Therefore, consistent perseverance may be a successful strategy to quell the buildup of fluid, maintain vasodilation, and allow for conquest over time. Indeed, all vasodilation agents may exert their benefit over a gradual time course. Just like the decline of patients succumbing to COVID-19 occurs over an extended time course of worsening pathogenesis, so too the vasodilation agents may mitigate the same pathogenic process over an extended course of the viral illness. In other words, treating for just two days may not suffice even though some clinical improvement is observed. Stopping at that point may incur a rebound in status. Rather, a course of treatment at least five to seven days and up to two to three weeks in severe cases may be best.",

Additionally, they may be markedly sleepy and difficult to arouse. A pulse oximeter may fail to retrieve a saturation level when placed on their fingers and may yield a result only after being placed on their forehead. This may reflect an underlying lack of perfusion to extremities and conserving mechanisms for blood distribution. These patients are extremely ill and, although they may have stable vital signs, may be at risk for rapid deterioration. Similar treatment may ensue, but with compromised oral intake, intravenous fluid hydration may be needed; this may be best conducted at a gentle, gradual, and consistent rate. This subgroup should be recognized as possibly being part of a separate group of patients with an advanced illness that may require special attention.",

Nonetheless, while correcting any concomitant disturbance (e.g. renal failure, hyperosmolar syndrome, hypernatremia, etc.), bearing in mind the central role of pulmonary deterioration in overall clinical demise is crucial. Ultimately, morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 may be a result of a failure to accommodate the pathogenic sequelae of toxic viral provocation rather than an immunologic deficiency. Therefore, aiding in the adaptation and negotiation of a physiologic response to the transient viral insult may effectively mitigate disease burden and promote improved outcomes. Altogether, implementing a strategy that optimizes flow via the alveolar-capillary unit may be a progressive path forward.",

Larger clinical studies are warranted. Future studies may also elucidate results in different patient populations and possibly reveal benefits even in mechanically ventilated patients. Consideration of treatment with a CCB in patients who are suffering from COVID-19 and that do not have underlying hypertension may be studied as well. Other potential therapies that function as vasodilators in pulmonary arterial flow should be pursued. Potential benefits may outweigh the risks of including nifedipine or amlodipine in the treatment regimens of elderly patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19.",
