Correspondingly, adopting effective measures to prevent and control infectious diseases is a meaningful and challenging problem for public health research. To implement effective measures for infectious disease prevention and control, it is necessary for scientists to make clear of the infectious agent, that is, the pathogen of the infectious disease. The pathogen is a disease producer such as a virus, bacteria, prion, or fungus that causes disease to its host. For example, SARS is caused by a coronavirus [1] . The pathogenic spectrum of an infectious disease demonstrates the constituent ratio of each pathogen, which is related to the infectious disease. Example 1 gives an example of calculating the pathogenic spectrum. Pathogenic spectrum analysis is a meaningful work in public health, since the variation of the pathogenic spectrum is the basis of disease break. Specifically, the change rate of the pathogenic spectrum is a significant indicator to evaluate the possibility of infectious disease break. Moreover, predicting the trend of the pathogenic spectrum alternation is helpful for the early warning of infectious disease break. Example 1. Given an infectious disease, suppose there are four viruses, v 1 , v 2 , v 3 and v 4 , related to it. The virus-test result shows that the numbers of cases that are positive to these four viruses are 20, 50, 60 and 70, respectively. Then the virus pathogenic spectrum of this infectious disease consists of four parts. That is, v 1 : 20/(20+50+60+70) = 10%, v 2 : 50/(20+50+60+70) = 25%, v 3 : 60/(20+50+60+70) = 30%, and v 4 : 70/(20+50+60+70) = 35%.",

However, none of these methods works well in all situations. For example, ARIMA is suitable for developing a linear model, while the disadvantages of ANN include \"black box\" nature, computational burden, proneness to over fitting, and the empirical nature of model building. Traditional methods may fail to develop adequate models due to the nonlinear dynamic behavior of time series, but also due to the lack of adaptation of the methods. This makes the problem is suitable for using heuristic methods, like evolutionary computation, which can develop the model without making many assumptions. For example, Genetic Programming has been widely performed for time series forecasting [8, 9] .",

By time series study, scientists can extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data, and use the model to forecast future events based on known past events. Specifically, the model developed by time series prediction from the past data is used to predict data points before they are measured. Time series study has been widely applied in many domains, such as econometrics, meteorology, astronomy. The model for time series data represents stochastic process. Based on the model form, time series prediction methods can be classified into three types: linear model, such as ARMA, ARIMA [12] , non-linear, such as ARCH, GARCH [13, 14] , and model-free, such as some wavelet transform based methods [15] .",

The most characteristic players in GEP are the chromosomes and the expression trees, the latter consisting of the expression tree of the genetic information encoded in the former. The chromosome is a linear, symbolic string of fixed length. One or more genes compose a chromosome by using linking function. Each gene is divided into a head and a tail. The head contains symbols that represent both functions and terminals, whereas the tail contains only terminals [10] . For each problem, the length of the head h is chosen by the user, whereas the length of the tail t is a function of h and the number of arguments of the function with more arguments n, and is evaluated by the equation: t = h (n -1) + 1. Consider a gene for which the set of functions F = {+, -, *, /}. In this case the maximum number of arguments of the element in F is 2, then n = 2.",

The structural organization of GEP genes guarantees that any genic change in the chromosome always generates a valid expression tree [10] .

The chromosome is called as the individual's genotype, while the expression tree is called as the individual's phenotype [11] . Figure 1 shows a gene is encoded as a linear string and its expression in expression tree. The valid part of gene is shown in bold in Figure 1 . The GEP algorithm begins with generating of the initial population, composed of a set of chromosomes, in a random way. Each chromosome is a candidate solution. Then the chromosomes (genotype) are expressed as expression trees (phenotype) and the fitness of each individual is evaluated by the predetermined fitness function. There are many kinds of measurements can be used as the fitness function, such as relative error and absolute error. The individuals are then selected according to fitness to reproduce with modification, generating new individuals with new traits. The individuals of the new generation are subjected to the same evolutionary process: expression of the genomes, selection by the fitness, and new individual generation. This procedure is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found, or a predetermined stop condition is reached. Then the evolution stops and the best-so-far solution, evolved by GEP, is returned [10] .",

            "text": "To evaluate the performance of our GEP-based sliding window mining method, we implement all proposed algorithms in Java. The experiments are performed on an Intel Pentium Dual 1.80 GHz (2 Cores) PC with 2G memory running Windows XP operating system. We apply our proposed method to the real-world diarrhea syndrome monitoring data, which is provided by the department of health statistics, Sichuan University. There are four viruses, calicivirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and astrovirus, related to diarrhea syndrome, so these four viruses are pathogens of diarrhea syndrome. The monitoring data contains the numbers of cases that are positive to virus test for these four pathogens in every month of Year 2009 and Year 2010. Since the data is sensitive, we skip over the semantic details and formulate the data formally as follows. Let D be the monitoring data of any related pathogen. Suppose D = {d i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 24}, where d i is the number of positive pathogen cases in one month. In D, d 1 is the data of January in 2009, and d 24 is the data of December in 2010. In our work, we just consider the effectiveness of the proposed method in the real-world positive pathogens prediction, instead of the meaning of predicted data. As the observation time period of diarrhea syndrome monitoring data is one year, the monitoring data can be divided into two time-partitions, p 1 and p 2 , at most based on Algorithm 1. Take d 24 as an example, the first time-partition p 1 contains data in Year 2010, and the second time-partition p 2 contains data in Year 2009. The proposed method is applied to the monitoring data to generate the training sets for GEP prediction. The size of sliding window is set as 6. In considering the requirement of diarrhea syndrome analysis and the total number of monitoring data is small, for each pathogen, we take the last monitoring data, d 24 , as the test value in the experiments. Let W be the sliding window. There are two sub-sliding windows, w 1 and w 2 , satisfying w 1 \u2286 p 1 and w 2 \u2286 p 2 . The proposed method generates different combinations of w 1 and w 2 , as well as corresponding training sets. For each training set, we run GEP 10 times independently, and record the average training accuracy and prediction accuracy, which are measured in absolute error. Table 1 lists the GEP related parameters in our experiments. Table 2 to Table 5 lists the experiment results. As the size of sliding window is set as 6, the available sub-sliding window combinations include (|w 1 |=6, |w 2 |=0), (|w 1 |=5, |w 2 |=1), (|w 1 |=4, |w 2 |=2) and (|w 1 |=3, |w 2 |=3). We take the combination (|w 1 |=6, |w 2 |=0) as the baseline sliding window, for it is the traditional time-adjacent sliding window. The highest average accuracies of training and test are in bold font. As the main purpose of this experiment is verifying the effectiveness of the method to discover good sliding window for GEP prediction, without loss of generality, we apply the basic GEP method on each training set. We believe that more accurate prediction results can be got by some improved GEP methods, such as the methods in [16, 17] . From Table 2 to Table 5 , we can see that for predicting the positive pathogens of calicivirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and astrovirus, different sub-sliding window combinations get different training and test accuracies. The highest training accuracy and test accuracy can be got when the combination of sub-sliding windows is (|w 1 |=3, |w 2 |=3), while for predicting the positive pathogens of adenovirus, the highest training accuracy and test accuracy are got when the combination of sub-sliding windows is (|w 1 |=6, |w 2 |=0). Thus, better sliding window for prediction, compared with traditional time-adjacent sliding window, can be discovered by our proposed method. Moreover, in the case of time-adjacent sliding window is good for prediction our method also can find it, such as predicting the positive pathogens of rotavirus.",

Different form traditional methods that may fail to develop adequate models due to the nonlinear dynamic behavior of time series, or the lack of adaptation of the methods, GEP can develop the model without making many assumptions. As a result, applying GEP to positive pathogens prediction is desirable. However, traditional time-adjacent sliding window may not be suitable for GEP evolving accurate prediction model. Based on analyzing the characteristics of diarrhea syndrome, we propose a heuristic method to mine good sliding window for generating training set, which is used for GEP evolution. Furthermore, we prove the problem of training set selection is NP-hard. The experimental study on real-world positive pathogens prediction shows that our proposed method is necessary and effective for diarrhea syndrome related pathogens prediction. There are many works worth to be deeply analyzed in the future. For example, how to add the environment factors in good sliding window mining, how to describe the relationships among previous data, and how to evaluate the candidate sliding windows in a fast way.

Basis: When k = 2, W = {w 1 , w 2 }, |w 2 | = M -|w 1 |. As |w 1 | \u2208 {0, 1, 2, ..., M}, NC(W) = (M+1) < (M+2) as desired. Inductive steps: Assume NC(W) < (M+2) n-1 , when k = n. That is, W = {w 1 , w 2 , \u2026, w n }. For k = n + 1, let W = W' \u222a w n+1 , where W' = {w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , \u2026, w n }. As |W'| = M -|w n+1 |, NC(W') < (M -|w n+1 | + 2) n < (M + 2) n . The number of combinations between W' and w 1 is (M + 1). Thus, NC(W) < (M + 2) n \u00b7 (M + 1) < (M + 2) (n+1) = (M + 2) k .",

It has a powerful numeric calculation capability to evolve accurate model.The basic idea of applying GEP to time series mining is a sliding window prediction method. In training stage, once the size of sliding window is determined, the training set can be generated by the sliding window. For data in sliding windows, GEP takes them as the independent variables and evolves a model to fit the target values. Moreover, the sliding window is always time-adjacent prior to the target value. For example, given a dataset D = {d i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}, suppose the sliding window size is 3. Then, for target value d i , the dataset in sliding window is {d i-3 , d i-2 , d i-1 }. However, Example 2 demonstrates that this kind of sliding window may not be suitable to predict positive pathogens in diarrhea syndrome monitoring data.Example 2. Let dataset D = {d i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 24} be the numbers of positive cases of a diarrhea syndrome related pathogen every month since 2005 to 2006. Each data in D is list in table below.Suppose the sliding window size is 3. If we apply GEP to find the relationship between d i and (d i -1, d i -2, d i -3), 4 \u2264 i \u2264 24, GEP fails to find accurate relationship.
