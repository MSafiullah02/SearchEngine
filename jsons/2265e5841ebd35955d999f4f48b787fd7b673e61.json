Many humans with such contacts in these early periods must have experienced novel severe diseases, now termed zoonoses, a whose causality evolved from animal infectious agents that spread through vectors or had become contagious in humans (e.g., the plague a Animal-to-human transmission; and human-to-animal transmission as anthropozoonoses. or measles). In relation to the older zoonoses, descendants of surviving men and women over many generations would have developed at least partial immunity to the infectious agents. Through exploration, conquests, and war, world history was markedly affected when \"virginal\" or naive populations, particularly in America and on the Australian continent, experienced the disastrous consequences from such older zoonotic infections. 2, 3 We have experienced many emerging zoonotic diseases in the past century, but the most rapidly spreading global one has been human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, which is primarily spread sexually.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 332, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1307, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1309, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical view"}, {"text": "Historically, the bridging of early knowledge obtained on human and animal health in the Greek and Roman eras, was first recorded by Hippocrates and Galen-his disciple-an early \"physician.\" 4 Over the next millennium, practitioners of human diseases also dealt with animal diseases, with much being learned from anatomical, physiological, and other studies that could not be performed on human bodies. A particularly important historical example is Giovanni Lancisi, an Italian physician, who, in doi: 10 .1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06138.x 1713, was dispatched by Pope Clement to investigate and provide descriptions of an outbreak in Rome of the \"cattle plague,\" or rinderpest. Lancisi was probably the first to suggest its \"contagious\" nature, as being due to \"some exceedingly fine and pernicious particles, which pass from one body to another, by contact.\" He also pioneered public health preventive measures by restricting the movement of cattle from areas in which there were many diseased animals. 5 Such a policy was among those used later to eradicate rinderpest, the progenitor of the measles virus, from the world in 2010; a similar concept led William Foege and others to vaccinate the people in the areas around infected communities, as part of the eradication of global smallpox in 1980. 6 This was accomplished by using the vaccine resulting from the one health-one medicine consciousness extant in the 18th century, when the English physician, Edward Jenner-with encouragement by John Hunter-adapted the cowpox virus as a live vaccine for humans. 7 Coincidently, widespread use of cowpox vaccines in humans may have initially promoted transmission back to cattle from recent vaccines; eventually, this practice reduced transmission of cowpox between cattle, thus indirectly controlling and later eliminating the disease in dairy herds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 191, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 502, "end": 504, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1002, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1299, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1560, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical view"}, {"text": "The formal specific training of animal-related knowledge began in 1761, b with the founding of the first school of veterinary medicine in Lyon, France. 8 By the 19th century, several other scientific disciplines, for example, parasitology and entomology, played an important role for animal-human health. In addition, major contributions to both fields were made by Louis Pasteur, a chemist, assisted by several physicians in his laboratory. 9 The French and the German schools led by Robert Koch, joining in the new fields of bacteriology and immunology, identified many new bacteria in animals and humans. Their findings were instrumental in the diagnosis of many diseases and in the burgeoning immunological application to prevention and treatment. 10, 11 Clinical pathology also became particularly prominent in its applicability to a better understanding of animal and human diseases, by such physicians as Robert Koch, Paul Ehrlich, William Osler, and Rudolph Virchow.

A professor of veterinary epidemiology with broad medical experience, Calvin Schwabe, was instrumental in the 1960s to reintegrate the two in his textbook Veterinary Medicine and Human Health. 13 One of us (JHS), who also reviewed the book, 14 helped to extend this theme to include veterinary and human public health, through different contributions to national and global public health. 15,16 At Steele's 90th birthday celebration in 2003, William Foege noted the success of this integrative concept, \"We made the point at the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and everywhere, that you cannot deal with the health of people without dealing with the health of animals-the two are inseparable.\" 17 We propose now to further integrate such unifying concepts, with the inclusion of many more relevant disciplines, to emphasize the evolutionary paradigm. The large diversity of causal viruses, bacteria, and parasites that can assume a sexual route of transmission represents a very large number of important diseases, including (re)emerging ones, in humans and many animal species.

Hayward, admonished their physician \"venereologists\" to pay more attention to sexually transmitted diseases and their causal infectious agents in animals, providing some interesting comparisons to humans and their agents. 24 About two decades later, Janis Antonovics and his evolutionary biology team in the United States, provided an extensive comparative evolutionary review of sexually transmitted infectious agents, not only in mammals, but also in insects and plants. The year of publication was 1996, 25 around the same time as the first genome sequencing of any microbial agent-Hemophilus influenzae. 26 Since that time, molecular biology has advanced almost logarithmically, being applied to various (proto)human, animal, and plant organ-isms and an increasing number of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites that acquired the potential of sexual transmission over very long or sometimes short periods of time. Such information has helped to place evolution in its newer paradigm for basic and practical workers in the field, particularly for the kind of questions and possible answers that might be gleaned. It is important to note that focus is placed on a variety of infectious agents that can assume sexual transmission primarily in nature.

The historic overuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine has been acknowledged for some time, with some measurable progress made in continuing efforts to reduce the excess usage. A different approach extends through most of the animal health and veterinary communities particularly in managing antibiotic administration to livestock and, less so, to companion animals. Specifically in the case of livestock, continuing use of antibiotics at subtherapeutic dosages is employed for assuring optimal feed conversion ratios and to some extent as a prophylactic measure to control disease, especially in intensive concentrated animal feeding operations. The actual means by which feed conversion is enhanced remains not fully explained, and was serendipitously discovered from feeding leftover mash from chlortetracycline antibiotic production to chickens. 32 DuPont and Steele have offered a balanced summary of this issue noting, \"While the extensive body of knowledge that exists on the subject provides convincing evidence that the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs as feed additives in animal populations has economic benefits, minimal convincing evidence exists that the practice poses substantial hazards to human health.\" 33 A number of considerations contribute to these disparate views and include the fact that almost all antibiotics used in human medicine and veterinary medicine overlap by >90%. Resistant microorganisms are selected by various mechanisms that can then horizontally transmit resistance to the same, or other, species. Most importantly, the agents can spread between humans and animals through direct and indirect contact, as well as by associated food products. Heretofore, pharmaceutical companies have been able to address increasing resistance through development of second and third generation agents, but that pipeline is becoming exhausted. Development of new agents is greatly reduced and we are now approaching the era of super \"super bugs.\" 34 Within the animal health sphere, many of our European colleagues have taken measures to eliminate the practice of subtherapeutic administration of antibiotics, and they urge the United States to do likewise. 35 The movement of people, animals, and food products globally between continents is very much a part of our contemporary world. Antonovics and colleagues have reminded us that the correct word is not \"emergence\" of antimicrobial resistance, but \"evolution\" that follows use of antimicrobial agents-in effect putting evolution on a fast track by drastically changing the environment with antimicrobials. 36 Recognizing that microorganisms' generation time can be as short as 20 min, coupled with the development time for new antimicrobials being approximately 10 years, indicates we are dealing with an emergency. Interspecies transmission of resistant factors is also distressing, especially in light of the fact that gut flora and urogenital floras overlap by 80%. 37 Vaccines Immunizing products are the holy grail of infectious disease and public health prevention. Within the human STI sphere, we have papilloma virus vaccine for young women that promise to greatly reduce this annoying problem, including subsequent cervical cancers resulting from long-term infections. Of comparative interest, Scase et al. in the UK studied the etiology of genital squamous cell carcinoma in horses and identified a papilloma virus in the affected tissue. 38 This novel virus has been identified as Equus caballus papillomavirus-2 and was present in the genital tumor samples but not in the adjacent histologically normal tissue. The author's summary is quoted, \"Potential relevance: Identifica-tion of a papillomavirus causal for genital carcinomas in horses may lead to development of a vaccine that could be used to prevent this serious disease in horses. This would be analogous to man, where vaccination against oncogenic papillomavirus species is currently being used to help prevent cervical cancer.\"", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1395, "end": 1397, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2147, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2358, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2760, "end": 2762, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3125, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3603, "end": 3605, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug resistance"}, {"text": "From an animal standpoint, herpesvirus infections of poultry, also known as Marek's disease (MD), results in neoplastic disease.

Just over 100 years ago, H7 strains were demonstrated to be the cause of \"fowl plague,\" a serious poultry disease.

JHS happens to have been the first to conclusively prove a case of human infection with fowl plague virus in the United States. advances enable recognition of viruses, bacteria, or other infectious agents that may not be identified by standard cell culture systems or microscopy. Several of the new methods are permitting identification of multiple agents in a single sample, for example, for respiratory syndrome investigation, to identify influenza A and B, adenovirus, and coronavirus. 41 A particularly novel technology-metagenomics -is allowing identification of many more, previously unrecognized, microorganisms: Examples of metagenomics applications in veterinary medicine have been well characterized by Blomstr\u00f6m in her recent doctoral thesis work. 42 In one series of applications, metagenomic techniques were used to study viruses involved with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine. While caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) virus, a high percentage of pigs are coinfected with torque teno virus, genotypes 1 and 2 (TTV-1 and TTV-2), and two viruses, as well as a novel porcine bocavirus. Likewise, a metagenomics study of shaking mink syndrome, a disease of unknown etiology, using classical testing methods, identified a mink astrovirus in brain tissue, heretofore associated with preweaning diarrhea, as a possible cause. In yet another effort, soft ticks collected in Uganda were tested, using random amplification and large-scale sequencing. A novel RNA virus, most closely related to the hepatitis-E genogroup, was identified. 42 The promise of these techniques to better identify and characterize various infectious agents, including STIs, is almost limitless and could lead to novel prevention and control strategies.
