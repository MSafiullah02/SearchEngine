These factors include the convergence of morphological characters from similar ecological forces, and multiple substitutions in genetic data (\u201csaturation\u201d). Convergence and saturation often result in low bootstrap support values, poor Bremer decay indices or low Bayesian posterior probability values for some branches (Swofford et al., 1996). However, poor branch support can also be caused by failure to use a sufficient quantity of data (Fishbein et al., 2001), use of data that are inappropriate for the level of divergence that is being analysed (de Queiroz et al., 1995), or rapid evolutionary radiations among taxa (Fishbein et al., 2001). Often, it is difficult to know which factors are operating in any particular case.",

Other situations requiring robust phylogenies include the forensic use of phylogenies to identify the source of infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (Korber et al., 2000, Rambaut et al., 2001, Worobey et al., 2004) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Guan et al., 2003).",

Microgastrinae, a subfamily of Braconidae (Hymenoptera), is a speciose group with approximately 1400 described species in over 55 genera, and it has been estimated that there may actually be 5000 to 10,000 species worldwide (Whitfield, 1997b, Whitfield et al., 2002). Microgastrine wasps lay their eggs on lepidopteran larvae, and the wasp larvae develop while consuming the tissues of the lepidopteran larvae (Whitfield, 1997b, Whitfield et al., 2002). Many microgastrine wasp species have been transferred around the world to aid in the control of crop pests (Whitfield, 1997b, Whitfield et al., 2002). All microgastrine wasps have inherited an association with polydnaviruses, which are incorporated into the wasp genomes and help the wasp larvae evade lepidopteran immune systems (Whitfield and Asgari, 2003). It has therefore been of considerable coevolutionary interest to compare the phylogenetic histories of the wasps and those of the viruses. A robust phylogenetic framework is essential for producing a useful and informative classification for this large, economically and ecologically important insect group.",

The poorly supported branches in the microgastrine phylogenies are mainly short internal branches (Mardulyn and Whitfield, 1999, Whitfield et al., 2002). It was proposed that the short branches might have arisen from a rapid radiation as the microgastrines colonised new lepidopteran host species (Mardulyn and Whitfield, 1999), which themselves may have been diversifying in the early Tertiary (Grimaldi, 1999, Whitfield, 2002). Support for the rapid radiation of microgastrines was bolstered by the fact that the same branches were estimated to be short from multiple data sources. However, it was also acknowledged that the poorly supported short branches may have been due to insufficient data or the use of genes with rates of divergence that are inappropriate for the levels of divergence between the taxa (Mardulyn and Whitfield, 1999).",

We use parametric and nonparametric bootstrapping of simulated datasets to estimate how much data would be required to resolve the phylogeny with every branch having nonparametric bootstrap values greater than 50%. The simulations show that unless an impractically large amount of molecular data is obtained, the use of morphological characters may be necessary to produce a completely robustly supported phylogeny that can be used to examine cophylogenetic relationships between microgastrine wasps and polydnaviruses.",

The nuclear gene 28S (including the D2 and D3 expansion loops) has provided a strong signal for intermediate and moderately deep levels in the phylogeny (Belshaw et al., 1998, Belshaw and Quicke, 1997, Cameron and Mardulyn, 2001, Cameron and Williams, 2003, Dowton and Austin, 1998, Mardulyn and Whitfield, 1999, Michel-Salzat and Whitfield, 2004, Whitfield, 2002, Whitfield et al., 2002, Wiegmann et al., 2003) and retains at least some signal at the species level. COI has been found to saturate quickly at the third position while remaining quite \u201cconserved\u201d at the first two positions due to a small number of sites free to vary (Mardulyn and Whitfield, 1999). Thus, it has proven highly useful at lower levels to detect species boundaries (Hebert et al., 2003a, Hebert et al., 2004, Hebert et al., 2003b) but has tended to fail at higher levels, especially in divergence time estimation studies (e.g., Whitfield, 2002).",

The nuclear gene EF1\u03b1 has been used extensively to resolve lepidopteran relationships at intermediate phylogenetic levels (Cho et al., 1995, Friedlander et al., 1998, Mitchell et al., 1997, Mitchell et al., 2000, Mitchell et al., 2006, Wiegmann et al., 2000) and has been used recently in a number of studies on Hymenoptera (Cameron, 2003, Danforth et al., 2004, Danforth and Ji, 1998, Kawakita et al., 2003, Leys et al., 2002, Michel-Salzat et al., 2004). The gene occurs in at least two divergent copies in most Hymenoptera (originally reported by Danforth and Ji, 1998), but these copies are easily separated by PCR once taxon-specific primers are developed. We used primers that amplify the F2 copy in bumble bees (Kawakita et al., 2003).",

It has been suggested that Bayesian posterior probabilities tend to be higher than MP bootstrap proportions for the same groups (Erixon et al., 2003). However, it has also been suggested that bootstrap values may be a conservative estimate of support for clades when support for clades is strong (Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 2004, Rannala and Yang, 1996) and it is likely that posterior probabilities give a better estimate of support than bootstrap proportions, especially when the most complex Bayesian models are used (Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 2004).

The approach using Seq-Gen was more optimistic, suggesting complete support was possible with around 12,000 nucleotides. However, the nonparametric method of simulating datasets produces data without gaps or missing data and thus produces a \u201cperfect\u201d dataset that is almost certainly unobtainable in reality. For example, we estimated a phylogeny with only one branch with less than 50% bootstrap support from a dataset simulated with Seq-Gen of the same size as our actual dataset. This compares to 14 branches with less than 50% bootstrap support in the phylogeny estimated from the actual data.

There is also controversy over whether significant heterogeneity should preclude combining data derived from different genes for a phylogenetic analysis. Yoder et al. (2001) examined the effect of changing character weighting and/or data combinations on the phylogenetics of slow lorises and found that correct results were poorly supported and even incorrect results were obtained when character weighting and/or data combinations were altered to reduce incongruence (as assessed by the ILD). Likewise, Sullivan (1996) found that combining two heterogeneous datasets produced a better estimate of deer mouse and grasshopper mouse phylogenies than did either gene alone.

Given that our choice of genes covered deep, medium and shallow divergences and that these genes have been used successfully to estimate robust phylogenies for an enormous variety of taxa, we do not conclude that inappropriate gene choice has caused the poor support for some of the nodes. The contribution to the phylogenies from all the COI data is likely subject to long branch attraction (Felsenstein, 1978, Hendy and Penny, 1989) as this gene has the highest uncorrected pairwise divergences of the seven genes between microgastrine species and yet it has only the fifth highest levels of divergence between the braconid subfamilies.

However, as few as eight genes would give mean bootstrap values of 95% with a 95% confidence interval if nonstationary genes (genes that have markedly shifted nucleotide frequencies for some taxa) were excluded from the Saccharomyces analysis (Collins et al., 2005). Deleting the third positions of codons from our data resulted in the genes becoming stationary.

However, it was also argued that increasing the number of taxa equally reduces error in phylogenetic estimations (Pollock et al., 2002). The improvement in phylogenetic accuracy is in part determined by the length of sequences already obtained and by the levels of divergence between the taxa (Hillis et al., 2003). For example, if there are several long branches in the phylogeny, effort may be better expended on sequencing taxa that break up the long branches rather than adding more characters (Graybeal, 1998). In the microgastrine case, our simulations showed that neither adding taxa nor genetic data would increase bootstrap support for the short branches in the phylogeny.",
