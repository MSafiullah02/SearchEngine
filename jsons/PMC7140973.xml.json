The epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started from Wuhan, China, last December and have become a major challenging public health problem for not only China but also countries around the world (Phelan et al. 2020). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that this outbreak had constituted a public health emergency of international concern (Mahase 2020). The novel coronavirus was initially named 2019-nCoV and officially as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of February 26, COVID-19 has been recognized in 34 countries, with a total of 80,239 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,700 deaths (WHO 2020b).",

Rubber dams and high-volume saliva ejectors can help minimize aerosol or spatter in dental procedures. Furthermore, face shields and goggles are essential with use of high- or low-speed drilling with water spray (Samaranayake et al. 1989). According to our clinic experience during the outbreak, if a carious tooth is diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, pulp exposure could be made with chemomechanical caries removal under rubber dam isolation and a high-volume saliva ejector after local anesthesia; then, pulp devitalization can be performed to reduce the pain. The filling material can be replaced gently without a devitalizing agent later according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. We also met a patient who had a spontaneous toothache because of a cracked tooth without dental decay, and a high-speed handpiece had to be used to access cavity preparation. Given that the patient wanted to retain the tooth, she was scheduled as the last patient in the day to decrease the risk of nosocomial infection. After treatment, environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures were followed. Alternatively, patients could be treated in an isolated and well-ventilated room (Fig. 3) or negatively pressured rooms if available for suspected cases with COVID-19.",

If the tooth needs to be extracted, absorbable suture is preferred. For patients with facial soft tissue contusion, debridement and suturing should be performed. It is recommended to rinse the wound slowly and use the saliva ejector to avoid spraying. Life-threatening cases with oral and maxillofacial compound injuries should be admitted to the hospital immediately, and chest CT should be prescribed if available to exclude suspected infection because the RT-PCR test, besides time-consuming, needs a laboratory with pan-coronavirus or specific SARS-CoV-2 detection capacity.",

Existing smart devices and applications have already made it possible for students to listen to and review lectures whenever and wherever possible. In fact, our students started online learning from February 17. Second, it is worth advocating to encourage students to engage in self-learning, make full use of online resources, and learn about the latest academic developments. Third, during this period, it is easy for students to be affected by disease-associated fear and pressure, and dental schools should be prepared to provide psychological services to those who need them (Wong et al. 2004).",
