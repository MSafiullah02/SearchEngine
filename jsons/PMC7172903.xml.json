Urgent surgery was still performed for more lethal cancers such as T2+ bladder cancer, T3+ renal cell carcinoma, renal pelvic carcinoma, and high-risk prostate cancer (Supplementary Table 1). Surgery for less lethal disease (eg, repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor) was significantly decreased, which meant using a tailored approach to maximize patient benefit. We also tried to reduce unnecessary hospital visits for cancer patients as they have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection [3]. On February 19, 2020, we saw a drop in the supply of blood products as COVID-19 prevented blood donation. Thus, we had to stop most of the surgeries for more advanced cancers, resulting in another 75% decrease for such patients (Fig. 1B). This highlights that redistribution of blood products is needed as early as possible during public health emergencies.",

Patients were less likely to have comorbidities, postoperative complications decreased by 20%, and the transfusion rate was nearly 0%, although discharge times were similar to 2019. One reason for this might be that patients with unknown fever or abnormal blood cell counts were transferred to designated COVID-19 hospitals. Fewer patients aged >70 yr presented for surgery (a decrease of 82% was observed; Fig. 1C). This may reflect the higher death rate from COVID-19 in this group of patients, which might have made them more cautious, Oral drug administration was not delayed, but intravenous chemotherapies, percutaneous injection of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and intravenous PD-1 therapies were restricted. Appropriate deferral of ADT and PD-1 immunotherapies (not recommended to be delayed for >1 mo) was allowed. Enrollment in clinical trials was stopped from January 19 to March 2, and patients within trials had numerous protocol deviations. Of 110 patients in 33 ongoing clinical trials, each one experienced at least one protocol deviation; the average protocol deviation was 27 \u00b1 13 d (Fig. 1D). Efforts were made to minimize disruption and preserve the integrity of ongoing trials: outcomes and questionnaires could be collected remotely, oral drugs were permitted to be delivered under careful management, and interventions could be extended. Good communication between research staff, patients, and clinical trial institutions became increasingly important [4].",
