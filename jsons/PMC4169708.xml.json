Methodologically, this is a small study with extreme PK variability in both the observed plasma and ELF drug concentrations. Multiplication of the measured pulmonary sample concentration by a dilution factor, derived from a comparison of urea concentrations in plasma and pulmonary samples,\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n may contribute to the greater variability observed in the pulmonary drug concentrations as compared with plasma concentrations. A possible biological explanation includes dilution of intrapulmonary piperacillin due to larger ELF volumes that are associated with increasing pulmonary permeability. Alternatively, \u03b2\u2010lactam antibiotics are substrates for organic anion transporters in other organs, such as the kidney.\n39\n Disruption of an active transport system may occur in the injured lungs of critically ill patients, which exhibit increased permeability to protein. Another explanation may be that an increase in pulmonary protein permeability preferentially affects diffusion of piperacillin and tazobactam into and out of the lung. Therefore, in lungs with low protein permeability, piperacillin diffuses into the lung faster than it diffuses out. The reverse occurs in lungs with higher protein permeability. Validation of the negative correlation of pulmonary piperacillin penetration and pulmonary permeability is required in a similar clinical cohort.",

The probabilities of achieving the same pharmacodynamic targets increase to 86 and 82% for plasma and ELF, respectively, when the MIC is known and organisms with MICs beyond the breakpoint (i.e.,>16 mg/l) are excluded. Therefore, 14\u201318% of patients with a \u201csusceptible\u201d organism will have suboptimal drug exposure. Furthermore, ~60% of patients will not achieve the plasma or ELF pharmacodynamic targets associated with suppression of antimicrobial resistance (C\nmin/MIC > 3.4). This analysis identifies two important issues. First, 4 g piperacillin three times daily, as a 30\u2013min infusion, is inadequate for effective treatment and suppression of emergence of antimicrobial resistance in an unacceptably high proportion of critically ill patients, and especially in those with pneumonia resulting from infection with a less susceptible organism. Second, the probabilities of achieving each of the pharmacodynamic targets (e.g., fT>MIC and C\nmin/MIC) in plasma and ELF are similar. Plasma piperacillin concentrations do not precisely predict ELF piperacillin concentrations. Consequently, some individuals with \u201csufficient\u201d plasma piperacillin exposure will have inadequate ELF piperacillin exposures and vice versa. ELF rather than plasma exposure has been shown to predict outcome for other antimicrobial agents.\n17\n The causative organisms were not isolated in our 17 patients, which makes exploration of the relationship between piperacillin plasma and ELF PK, as well as pharmacodynamic (fT>MIC, C\nmin/MIC) and clinical outcomes, impossible. Further appropriately powered clinical studies are required to examine whether piperacillin exposure in plasma or ELF better predicts clinical outcomes.",

In addition, we showed an unexpected relationship of increased pulmonary permeability being associated with a reduction in pulmonary piperacillin penetration. We also demonstrated that predicting pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam exposures on the basis of plasma drug exposures may be unreliable. Appropriately powered clinical trials are required to further define the relationship between plasma and pulmonary drug exposures and to establish the impact of pulmonary, rather than plasma, drug exposure on clinical outcome. In addition, preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate mechanisms of lung penetration in patients with pneumonia. Biomarkers related to pulmonary permeability or drug penetration could be incorporated as covariates into mathematical models to improve predictions of pulmonary drug exposures. New regimens of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam may be required that optimize drug concentrations in the lung, at the site of infection. It is likely that a single regimen is not suitable for all individuals. If ELF exposure is shown to predict clinical outcome with greater accuracy than plasma exposure, and covariates for pulmonary drug penetration cannot be identified, then direct measurement of drug concentrations in the pulmonary compartment and adjustment of individual regimens may be required.",
