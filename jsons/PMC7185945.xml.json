Such knowledge should have a vital role in pandemic response, such as triage protocols to prevent further health disparities and discrimination.3 Vulnerability occurs in the gap in global health between those with the power to define and dismiss knowledge and needs, and those who are being defined and dismissed. A pandemic can be a call for recognition and repairing of the sociocultural, sociopolitical, and sociohistorical ruptures that generate vulnerability within specific categories of marginalised groups. As we continue to leap forward into the pandemic response, we risk missing the opportunity to avoid the \u201dpervasive failure to consult members of vulnerable groups and/or their representative organisations during crisis response\u201d.4 We can prevent the epistemic injustices of not listening and of silencing, and avoid delineating moral agency in ways that perpetuate vulnerability in a global pandemic.",
