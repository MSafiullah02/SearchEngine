            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) infections-i.e., infections involving the brain (cerebrum and cerebellum), spinal cord, optic nerves, and their covering membranes-are medical emergencies that are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, or long-term sequelae that may have catastrophic implications for the quality of life of affected individuals. Acute CNS infections that warrant neurointensive care (ICU) admission fall broadly into three categories-meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses-and generally result from blood-borne spread of the respective microorganisms. Other causes of CNS infections include head trauma resulting in fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate that can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures. Also, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) and congenital malformations (e.g., spina bifi da or sinus tracts) can become colonized and serve as sources or foci of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis. If infection occurs at sites (e.g., middle ear or mastoid) contiguous with the CNS, infection may spread directly into the CNS causing brain abscesses; alternatively, the organism may reach the CNS indirectly via venous drainage or the sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves. Abscesses also may become localized in the subdural or epidural spaces. Meningitis results if bacteria spread directly from an abscess to the subarachnoid space. CNS abscesses may be a result of pyogenic meningitis or from septic emboli associated with endocarditis, lung abscess, or other serious purulent infections. Breaches of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can result in CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the BBB; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specifi c interactions with the BBB that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism. The microorganisms that cause CNS infections include a wide range of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, spirochaetes (e.g., neurosyphilis), and parasites (e.g., cerebral malaria and strongyloidiasis). The clinical picture of the various infections can be nonspecifi c or characterized by distinct, recognizable clinical syndromes. At some juncture, individuals with severe acute CNS infections require critical care management that warrants neuro-ICU admission. The implications for CNS infections are serious and complex and include the increased human and material resources necessary to manage very sick patients, the diffi culties in triaging patients with vague or mild symptoms, and ascertaining the precise cause and degree of CNS involvement at the time of admission to the neuro-ICU. This chapter addresses a wide range of severe CNS infections that are better managed in the neuro-ICU. Topics covered include the medical epidemiology of the respective CNS infection; discussions of the relevant neuroanatomy and blood supply (essential for understanding the pathogenesis of CNS infections) and pathophysiology; symptoms and signs; diagnostic procedures, including essential neuroimaging studies; therapeutic options, including empirical therapy where indicated; and the perennial issue of the utility and effectiveness of steroid therapy for certain CNS infections. Finally, therapeutic options and alternatives are discussed, including the choices of antimicrobial agents best able to cross the BBB, supportive therapy, and prognosis. ",

These structures are protected within the rigid confi nes of the skull and spinal canal of the vertebral column. The cerebral cortex (the outermost, gray tissue layer of the cerebrum) and the spinal cord are covered by three layers of continuous protective tissue called the meninges. The innermost meningeal layer that directly overlies the cerebral cortex is called the pia mater. The middle and outermost layers are known as the arachnoid and dura mater, respectively. The dura mater forms several intracranial compartments, including sinuses for venous drainage. Parts of the arachnoid-the arachnoid villi-project into these sinuses. The subpial space is continuous with the Virchow-Robin spaces. These two spaces transmit penetrating vessels to and from the brain parenchyma and do not connect with the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space lies between the pia mater and the arachnoid and is continuous in nature; the subdural space lies between the arachnoid and the dura mater. The epidural space lies between the dura and the skull. Certain infections can access the subpial and Virchow-Robin spaces, while most do not. Infections within the epidural spaces are usually caused by direct extension from adjacent infections and the infection remains in close proximity to the inciting source. Subdural infections are often associated with an extracerebral source, but these infections can spread widely within the subdural compartment well away from the inciting source. It is not uncommon to develop serous subdural effusions in bacterial meningitis. Subarachnoid infections are most often caused by hematogenous dissemination of organisms or viruses.",

The capillary supply to the brain and spinal cord is unique-the outermost layers of endothelial cells are fused together. These specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells constitute the blood-brain barrier, which separates the brain and the meninges from the circulating blood and impedes the infl ux of microorganisms, toxic agents, and most other compounds, while regulating the fl ow of essential nutrients and molecules for normal neural function. Thus, pathogens that breach the blood-brain barrier can cause CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the barrier; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specifi c interactions with the bloodbrain barrier that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism (e.g., Escherichia coli, mycobacteria, and spirochaetes).

Bacteremia or viremia can result from infection at sites adjacent or contiguous to the CNS, such as the mastoid, sinuses, or middle ear, or from primary infections at more remote anatomic sites (e.g., lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney). In children the most common predisposing conditions are sinus or middle ear infection, which lead to transient bacteremia and hematogenous seeding of the CNS [ 1 -3 ] . Bacterial infections of the paranasal and otomastoid sinuses often produce phlebothrombosis of adjacent draining cortical (cerebral) veins. This thrombotic process can extend into regional dural sinuses. The phlebothrombosis becomes thrombophlebitis offering a direct route of transmission from the infected sinus to the adjacent extra axial spaces or to the brain along cortical venous drainage pathways. Recognition of the venous involvement is essential, since the venous obstruction can produce intra axial brain swelling which may obscure the extra axial infection source contributing to misleading interpretations on brain and spinal imaging studies. The common relationship between paranasal sinus and otomastoid causes of intracranial infection reinforces the need for the clinician and radiologic imager to be well versed in both head and neck and paraspinous anatomy.",

Although the nonencapsulated form of H . infl uenzae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract of healthy humans and causes localized infection (e.g., conjunctivitis or otitis media in children) without bacteremia, the more virulent encapsulated Hib serotype causes more invasive disease and is an important cause of meningitis or epiglottitis. Hib meningitis is relatively uncommon during the fi rst 2 months of life probably because of the presence of passively transferred maternal antibodies. But by the fourth month of life, children lose these antibodies and become at risk of Hib meningitis. The occurrence of H . infl uenzae meningitis is directly associated with the presence and development of type-specifi c anticapsular antibodies to polyribosylribitol phosphate. Whether vaccine-induced or occurring naturally, presence of these antibodies is directly related to protection from invasive H . infl uenzae infection [ 5 ] . Various clinical studies have shown these antibodies to be opsonic and bactericidal against H . infl uenzae in vitro and protective in vivo. In the pre-vaccine era, colonization with nontypable strains of H . infl uenzae led to the development of cross-reacting antibodies that were largely protective against infection caused by type b strains. Before the introduction of the Hib conjugate polysaccharide capsular vaccine in 1986, H . infl uenzae was the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in children under the age of 5, with as many as 1 in 200 children acquiring invasive H . infl uenzae infection, including epiglottitis, septicemia, arthritis, and soft tissue infections in addition to meningitis. However, by 1995, the prevalence of meningitis caused by Hib had fallen 55 % [ 6 ] .

In a study of 231 children presenting with bacterial meningitis to the emergency department during the era of widespread heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination, E . coli was implicated in 4 % and other gram-negative bacilli in 3.0 % [ 11 , 12 ] . Other gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Citrobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. may also cause meningitis in the neonatal period, with an epidemiology similar to that of the E . coli K1 strains. Gram-negative bacillary meningitis still carries a worse prognosis than meningitis with a gram-positive organism [ 13 ] . Beyond the neonatal period, the vast majority of cases of gram-negative meningitis occur in the inpatient setting, especially following neurosurgery (e.g., craniotomy) and during placement of devices, such as ventriculostomy tubes, spinal surgery, or in patients who have suffered head trauma [ 14 ] .",

Group B streptococci produce polysaccharide capsules that manifest nine antigenic serotypes (types Ia-VIII).

Bacteria migrate through the brain microvascular endothelial cells in enclosed vacuoles via a mechanism that is dependent on F-actin. Thus, transport through the cell appears to be dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangement involving both microfi laments and microtubules. Because of the blood-brain barrier, immunoglobulin and complement protein levels and leukocytes are signifi cantly lower in CSF than in serum and interstitial fl uid. Thus, in the early phase of infection involving the subarachnoid space, bacterial replication proceeds virtually unchecked by host defense mechanisms. Although the major host response to the invasion of the subarachnoid space by pathogenic microorganisms is a rapid infl ux of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, opsonization of bacteria and subsequent phagocytosis by neutrophils are hindered by the relative paucity of complement and immunoglobulins and the intrinsic fl uid nature of CSF which is less facilitating to phagocytosis as compared to solid tissues. In addition, leukocyte proteases derived from the initial infl ux of leukocytes degrade whatever complement components are present in the CSF [ 29 -31 ] .",

The mechanism by which LPS and other bacterial cell wall components (e.g., teichoic acid and peptidoglycans from S . pneumoniae ) act to stimulate infl ammation is probably through the induction of infl ammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [ 29 , 32 ] . In vitro studies with LPS and with IL-1 and TNF show that incubation with endothelial cell monolayers leads to a rapid, transient increase in the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) as well as the selectin molecules such as ELAM-1. As a result, neutrophils are able to bind to CNS vascular endothelial cells at vastly increased rates and then subsequently migrate by diapedesis into the subarachnoid space. At the same time, adherence of neutrophils to the capillary endothelium increases the permeability of the blood vessels enabling more protein leakage into the CSF and subarachnoid space, adding to the infl ammatory exudate. Figure 22 .2a, b shows the dense infl ammatory infi ltrate with neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages seen in a patient with purulent meningitis caused by S . pneumoniae . IL-1 and TNF, in turn, stimulate leukocytes and other categories of infl ammatory cells to produce and secrete a host of other proinfl ammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, free radicals, and nitric oxide. The end result is edema of the surrounding tissues, cell injury, and tissue necrosis. Infi ltration of the walls of small arteries and cortical veins also leads to a vasculitis with intimal thickening, narrowing and occlusion of small arteries, thrombophlebitis of the cortical veins, and thrombosis of the major venous sinuses, leading to ischemia and infarction of brain tissues.",

Though vomiting is a common symptom generally attributed to raised ICP, it is also a well-recognized manifestation of the effects of the infl ammatory process on the midbrain. The a b nature of the presentation of meningitis depends on the underlying microorganism responsible for the infection. For example, in pneumococcal meningitis ( S . pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent implicated in adult bacterial meningitis cases), the patient might have had pneumonia and bloodstream dissemination before progression to meningitis. Thus, the patient might have presented with chills and rigors or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia several days before the actual onset of meningitis symptoms. In the classic series by Carpenter and Petersdorf, approximately 27 % of patients had a sudden onset of headache, confusion, lethargy, and alteration of consciousness within the fi rst 24 h before admission to hospital [ 33 ] . In contrast, 53 % presented with a more slowly progressive course over 1-7 days. In a review of 493 episodes of meningitis, Durand and colleagues found that 95 % of the patients with acquired meningitis had a temperature greater than 37.7 \u00b0C on admission, while neck stiffness was present in 88 %. Only 22 % were alert, 51 % were confused or lethargic, and 22 % were responsive only to pain. Within the fi rst 24-48 h of onset, 29 % had suffered focal seizures or had exhibited focal neurologic signs [ 34 ] . The most common predisposing factors for acute meningitis included pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, alcoholism, diabetes, or immunosuppression associated with conditions, such as malignancy, connective tissue diseases, sickle cell disease, diabetes, organ transplantation, splenectomy, dialysis, or steroids and other immunosuppressive therapy. For patients with some of these underlying conditions, the clinical presentation of meningitis may not be classic because of alteration of the immune response, with the diagnosis only being made upon further investigation of altered sensorium, persistent headache, or new onset seizures or neurological symptoms or signs. The presentation of patients with meningococcal meningitis may be similar to those with pneumococcal meningitis; clinically, one might not be able to distinguish between the two. However, meningococcal meningitis is part of the spectrum of N . meningitidis sepsis and the manifestations of meningococcal septicemia may precede the meningitis by 12-24 h. Signs indicative of underlying sepsis may dominate the clinical presentation. The initial presentation in meningococcemia may be completely nonspecifi c, with the patient simply complaining of feeling unwell but without overt symptoms or signs of meningitis. The clinical condition of these patients may progress to irreversible shock and death before the development or obvious manifestation of meningitis.",

Typical symptoms and signs are also less commonly reported in the elderly since these patients often have cervical rigidity due to osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, or existing cerebrovascular disease. In addition, there may be hypertonicity of the neck muscles in conditions like Parkinson's disease. Among the elderly, the meningitis itself may progress more rapidly, and patients are more likely to present in coma when compared with younger patient populations. With the development of coma, nuchal rigidity may be markedly less pronounced. Thus, when meningitis is suspected in the elderly, true nuchal rigidity has to be distinguished by careful physical examination. The absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis of meningitis in the elderly patient.",

In neonates and infants, meningitis may present simply as fever or irritability; generally, there is a tendency for fever to be higher in children as compared to that in adults. The classic physical signs of meningeal infl ammation or irritation described in medical textbooks are the Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs [ 36 , 37 ] . Although Brudzinski originally described several signs of infl ammation of the meninges, the best known of these is the so-called \"nape of the neck\" sign-the classic Brudzinski's sign. This sign is elicited by fl exing the neck forward. The stretching of the meninges induced by this movement results in involuntary fl exion of the hips and knees. Kernig's sign is elicited with the patient in the supine position and the thigh fl exed on the abdomen with the knee fl exed at a 45\u00b0 angle. Upon passive extension of the leg in the presence of meningeal irritation, the patient resists extension with complaints of lower back and hamstring pain. Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs are neither sensitive nor specifi c indicators of meningitis and are potentially elicited in only about 50 % of children and only 5 % of adults with acute bacterial meningitis.",

Cerebral herniation occurs in about 5 % of patients with acute bacterial meningitis, accounting for about 30 % of the mortality [ 38 ] . Of note, the role of a CT scan is primarily to ascertain whether a spaceoccupying lesion is present; a CT scan cannot rule out the presence of increased ICP. Clinical signs suggestive of impending herniation include deteriorating level of consciousness, brainstem signs ( including pupillary changes, decorticate posturing, or irregular respirations), a very recent seizure, absent oculocephalic refl exes, or papilledema. Lumbar puncture should be delayed in such patients, even for those with a normal CT scan, until preventive measures can be implemented to decrease ICP [ 38 -42 ] . Other contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture include septic or hemodynamic shock, cardiorespiratory failure, presence of predisposing conditions for parameningeal abscesses (e.g., sinusitis, chronic ear discharge, or suppurative lung disease), bleeding disorders, and infection or loss of skin (e.g., burns) over the lumbar spine.",

The level should fl uctuate with respiration and can be elevated by the Valsalva maneuver. If the CSF pressure is measured again at the end of the procedure after appropriate volumes of CSF have been obtained and has dropped to zero, the possibility of a complete CSF block should be considered.

CSF will appear reddish if more than 6,000 red blood cells/mm 3 are present [ 43 ] . Xanthochromia is a yellow, orange, or pink discoloration of the CSF and is caused by the lysis of red blood cells resulting in hemoglobin breakdown to oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and bilirubin. Discoloration begins after RBCs have been in spinal fl uid for about 2 h. In cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, xanthochromia occurs within 2-4 h after the initial cerebral bleed; xanthochromia may develop in vitro if the CSF specimen contains increased numbers of red blood cells and is not centrifuged immediately upon arrival in the laboratory. Xanthochromia also occurs when CSF protein concentrations are greater than 150 mg/dL.

Because red cells may be present in spinal fl uid as a result of subarachnoid hemorrhage or through a traumatic tap, it is important to note whether red tinged or bloody CSF clears as sequential specimen tubes of CSF are obtained. Such clearing suggests a traumatic tap and can be documented in the laboratory by counting the red cells in successive tubes.

Protein levels in newborn infants are signifi cantly higher compared to older children and adults, averaging 90 mg/dL with normal levels up to 170 mg/dL. Extremely high levels (more than 1 g/dL) of CSF protein are suggestive of a CSF spinal block. Elevation of CSF protein on its own, however, is not specifi c for any specifi c type of meningitis. Table 22 .2 summarizes the CSF characteristics (macroscopic appearance, white cell count range and differential, protein and glucose levels) typically encountered in meningitis caused by various classes of organisms. In general, high CSF white cell counts are found in bacterial meningitis, where levels may be greater than 10,000 cells/mm 3 with 95 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Typically, WBC count in bacterial meningitis ranges between 500 and 5,000 cells/mm 3 , CSF glucose less than 40 mg/dL, and protein levels in the 100-500 mg/dL range. It is important to recognize that a predominance of PMNs may occur early in viral meningitis, within the fi rst 24-48 h, but this gradually shifts to a mononuclear predominance over the next 8 h if the lumbar puncture is repeated [ 45 , 46 ] .

Extensive literature exists describing the application of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection and quantifi cation of various bacterial and viral pathogens in CSF of patients with a putative diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive than previous technologies. However, this technique is expensive and not readily available in most hospital laboratories. Moreover, in clinical practice, physicians are likely to initiate empirical antimicrobial therapy anyway after requesting testing by conventional methods, especially for patients with typical CNS symptoms and signs. In this case, rapid diagnostic testing using PCR assays is likely to not make a difference in the clinical the clinical decision making and medical management of the patient.",

The major value of CT and MRI scans in patients with acute bacterial meningitis is in the investigation of complications, such as cerebral infarction, vasculitis, abscess, or hydrocephalus. Figure 22 .5a-d shows the typical neuroradiological appearances of the brain in patients with meningitis caused by L . monocytogenes , N . meningitidis , S . pneumonia e, and M . tuberculosis . In patients with prolonged fever of 10 days duration or longer, up to 25 % may have a subdural effusion a b d c Fig. 22 .5 ( a , b ) Acute meningitis; images include fl uid-sensitive, FLAIR T2-w sequence ( a ) and post-contrast T1-w ( b ) axial sequences. Findings in acute meningitis are frequently subtle especially viral meningitis. The FLAIR sequence. A presents normal CSF within the ventricles and sulci as hypointense (dark) relative to brain. With pial infl ammation there is leak of proteinaceous fl uid into the subpial and subdural spaces. This highly proteinaceous fl uid is hyperintense (bright relative to brain) and thus becomes visualized on fl uid-sensitive MRI sequences. Serous subdural effusions are often present as well, which are imaged as high-intensity fl uid outside the brain, as in this case, but without contrast enhancement along their surfaces. These types of fl uid collections are considered noninfective and they typically clear spontaneously after medical treatment. The contrasted MRI ( b ) demonstrates pial hyperemia along the right lateral cerebral convexity (compare to left side ). On the left there is thickening of the pia probably early subpial empyema. ( c , d ) Listeria rhombencephalitis; images include postcontrast T1-w section ( c ) and a T2-w sequence ( d ). When the distribution of the infl ammatory process involves mainly the upper brain stem, as in this instance, it is described as rhombencephalitis. Rhombencephalitis is uncommon but is one the manifestations of Listeria-based meningitis, as in this case. Note there is relatively little abnormal enhancement in this case of Listeria infection. If there is thick obvious enhancement in a similar distribution, fi ndings would be more consistent with a granulomatous infection, as in fungal or tuberculous meningitis. Similar fi ndings can also be part of noninfectious granulomatous pial disease, as in neurosarcoidosis and non-Langerhans histiocytosis; thus, tissue confi rmation is usually necessary (Fig. 22.6 ) . In some cases this may progress to a subdural empyema, which may account for the prolonged fever ( Fig. 22.7 ) . Cortical infarction is a common complication of bacterial meningitis and usually results from vasospasm of cerebral vasculature or vasculitis associated with the meningitis itself. The MRI scan is more sensitive than CT imaging in detecting cerebritis and cortical infarction. Cerebritis is an early complication that may occur during the fi rst 4 days ( Fig. 22.8 ). Early necrotic regions fi lled with polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells and with ill-defi ned parenchymal swelling characterize cerebritis. In late cerebritis (4-8 days), central necrosis increases, there is vascular proliferation and more infl ammatory cells, and suppurative foci begin to breakdown and become encapsulated.",

For example, chloramphenicol, which is highly lipid soluble, will readily penetrate uninfl amed meninges. Fortunately, in infl amed meninges therapeutic concentrations of penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin can be achieved for treatment of the vast majority of cases of bacterial meningitis. Because only the free, unbound portion of an antimicrobial agent is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, the degree of protein binding of the antimicrobial in the patient serum is critical in determining how much of the agent eventually gets through to the CSF.

However, in an animal model, administration of dexamethasone together with vancomycin reduced the penetration of vancomycin into the CSF by 29 % and lowered the rate of bacterial clearance during the fi rst 6 h in animals who received an intermediate dose of vancomycin. Animals that received a higher dose had therapeutic peaks maintained despite steroid use, suggesting that the anti-infl ammatory effect of the steroids, which reduce entry of antibiotics into the CSF, may be overcome to some extent by increasing the dose [ 57 ] .

Various clinical studies support the use of adjunctive dexamethasone in infants or children with H . infl uenza type b meningitis to reduce the risk of neurologic and audiologic complications, especially in those with raised ICP or coma. High-dose barbiturates may be helpful when other methods have failed to control increased ICP. Barbiturates decrease the CNS metabolic demand for oxygen thereby decreasing cerebral blood fl ow which, in turn, causes a fall in ICP. Phenobarbital is given at an initial dose of 5-10 mg/kg, at a rate of 1 mg/kg per minute followed by 1-3 mg/kg/h [ 61 , 62 ] . Such therapies require regular ICP measurements and monitoring of cerebral electrical activity with electroencephalography. Phenobarbital is given until the ICP falls to levels 20 mmHg or until approximately 90 % burst suppression on the EEG (i.e., nine out of the ten screens of the EEG are fl at) has been achieved. Serum phenobarbital concentrations should be kept within the range of 20-40 \u03bcg/mL. Pentobarbital is preferred because of its relatively short half-life (24 h) versus phenobarbital with a relatively longer half-life. Side effects of high-dose barbiturate therapy include cardiac depression with arrhythmias and hypotension, thus mandating invasive hemodynamic monitoring in these patients.",

The principles of therapy are to control seizure activity quickly and defi nitively. To initiate therapy, short-acting anticonvulsants, such as lorazepam or diazepam, are administered followed by a long-acting agent like phenytoin. Lorazepam is given IV in doses of 1-4 mg in adults, and 0.05 mg/kg in children. Phenytoin is given IV at a dose of 18-20 mg/kg and at a rate of no more than 50 mg/min. The rate should be decreased if signs of toxicity, such as hypotension or a prolonged QT interval, develop. If phenytoin is not successful in controlling seizure activity, intubation and treatment with IV phenobarbital may be necessary. Patients must be watched and monitored carefully for signs of toxicity, such as hypotension and respiratory depression. Phenobarbital should be given IV at a rate of 100 mg/min until seizure activity stops, up to an initial dose of 20 mg/kg.",

The overwhelming majority of these infections are caused by enteroviruses, which produce disease in outbreaks occurring mainly during the summer months, but may occur during May to October in warmer parts of the United States. While virtually all of the various serotypes of echovirus and Coxsackie virus can produce meningitis and meningoencephalitis, in addition to other syndromes, the 15 most commonly noted enteroviruses in the United States during 1970-2005 accounted for 83.5 % of CDC reports with known serotype [ 78 ] . The fi ve most commonly reported serotypes (echoviruses 9, 11, 30, and 6 and Coxsackie virus B5) in descending order of frequency accounted for approximately half (48 %) of all reports [ 78 ] . CSF was the most common specimen type. The epidemiologic pattern is one in which certain strains, such as echovirus 30 or echovirus 9, cause disease endemically, while other strains occur in sporadic outbreaks varying from year to year in different regions. Enteroviruses are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route and their activity tends to be increased in areas of overcrowding, poverty, and generally poor hygienic conditions. Arboviruses account for the majority of epidemic cases of encephalitis. Their occurrence follows an identical seasonal distribution to that of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis associated with enteroviruses. However, the mode of transmission is completely different. Arboviruses are spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes, which are part of a complex cycle of enzootic transmission between birds, mosquitoes, and small mammals. The epidemiology of these diseases may be affected in part by prevention efforts from the public health authorities. For example, many states maintain surveillance systems that include testing of mosquitoes for the presence of virus, as well as sentinel chicken fl ocks to determine arbovirus activity. Such efforts lead to early recognition of an outbreak and warnings by public health authorities for the population to take precautions such as insect repellants, wearing long sleeve shirts, and avoiding outdoor activity in the early evening hours when transmission is most likely to occur. In addition, mosquito control activities may contribute to reduction in rates of infection.",

An example of viral tissue tropism being determined by the combination of viral surface proteins and specifi c tissue receptors is that of the binding of the HIV GP120 to the CD4+ receptor on T4 lymphocytes. Other tissues with HIV tropism include monocytes and derived cells (macrophages), Langerhans cells, glial cells, and dendritic cells, all of which express the CD4+ receptor.

In the case of HSV, the distribution involves the medial part of the temporal lobe bilaterally with one temporal lobe generally much more involved than the other. Autopsy studies carried out on patients who died during active HSV encephalitis show the presence of virus in the olfactory bulbs, olfactory tracts, and the tracts of the limbic system which end in the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, cingulate gyrus, and olfactory cortex [ 86 ] . Thus, the virus appears to gain access to the CNS from the nasal mucosa to the olfactory bulbs and olfactory tracts, In the other one-third of patients, antibody to HSV is lacking at the time of onset of symptoms indicating that the encephalitis is likely part of the primary infection. Approximately 90-95 % of the cases of HSV encephalitis in older children and adults are due to HSV type I, with the remaining 5-10 % due to HSV type II. Neonatal herpes appears to be different, in that 90-95 % of these cases are due to HSV type II acquired from maternal or other sources at the time of birth. Infection of the CNS in neonates generally follows systemic viremic spread; however, there is no temporal lobe localization. Rabies infection may result from contact with saliva or other secretions from infected animals as well as the animal bite itself. Rabies replicates initially at the local site of inoculation, and for this reason emergency preventive measures, such as thorough cleansing of the wound and infi ltration with human rabies immunoglobulin, can be effective in preventing infection with this viral agent. In the process of local replication, the rabies virus invades the nerve sheaths and is transported via nerve cells to the CNS. The rapidity of the rabies virus in reaching the CNS is a function of the distance of the nerve endings from the CNS. Thus, bites on the lower extremities may take months to produce symptoms in the CNS, whereas bites in the face may reach the CNS within weeks. It is also important to recognize that the initial incident may be forgotten because of the length of time of the onset of CNS symptoms after the initial infecting event or because the inoculation may be unapparent as has been reported for bats [ 87 ] . Therefore, a high index of suspicion for rabies is essential when managing patients with encephalitis of unknown cause, especially in patients who exhibit signs of hyperirritability.",

            "text": "Viral meningitis is an acute illness characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, photophobia, and varying degrees of nonspecifi c symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Generally, neither disturbance of mental status nor abnormal neurological signs are characteristic of viral meningitis. The presence of obtundation, disorientation, seizures, or localized neurologic signs should suggest brain parenchymal involvement and a diagnosis of encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Neck stiffness is generally less severe compared with bacterial meningitis. Clinical clues to an enteroviral etiology include presence of a viral exanthem, pleuropericarditis, pleurodynia, painful oropharyngeal ulcers, or peripheral vesicular lesions suggestive of hand, foot, and mouth disease. The CSF in patients with viral meningitis is usually clear with an elevated white cell count; polymorphonuclear leukocytes may predominate within the fi rst 24-48 h, although this number rarely exceeds 80 % of total CSF white cells. CSF protein is generally mildly elevated, and the glucose is normal with the occasional exception in about 10-20 % of patients with mumps and less often in patients with enterovirus or HSV infection. In viral meningitis, the CSF gram stain will be negative and routine CSF cultures will not yield bacterial growth. When the initial CSF analysis shows over 50 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes, it is not uncommon for clinicians to repeat the lumbar puncture over the next 12-24 h to determine whether there is a shift a b towards a lymphocytic predominance, as one would expect in viral meningitis. A parameningeal infectious focus (e.g., brain abscess) will characteristically be associated with a CSF pleocytosis, a likely elevated protein, and a normal glucose. Thus, a patient with an epidural abscess or a brain abscess could present with mild headache, fever, and a CSF picture identical to that of viral meningitis. Some cases of sphenoid or frontal sinusitis may feature a CSF pleocytosis. Patients with fungal and tuberculous meningitis may also present with headache, fever, and stiff neck, but in general the clinical course is longer than an acute viral meningitis. The CSF in patients with fungal or tuberculous meningitis generally has a relatively low glucose level, usually less than 40 mg/dL.",

For example, HSV type II produces very typical aseptic meningitis with low-grade fever, headache, stiff neck, and photophobia as part of primary genital herpes infection. Therefore, it is important to question the sexually active patient about a history of genital herpetic lesions and to perform a pelvic examination in women where indicated. Aseptic meningitis can also be seen as part of the syndrome of primary HIV infection. Certain strains of leptospirosis will typically present with aseptic meningitis; however, most cases present in conjunction with systemic disease and severe involvement of other organs such as lung, liver, and kidney. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) belongs to the family Arenavirus and is found globally [ 88 ] . LCMV meningitis is typically associated with exposure to rodents, such as common house mouse ( Mus musculus and M . domesticus ), hamsters, and guinea pigs. Transmission occurs by inhalation (aerosol and droplet), fomites, or direct contact with excreta or blood from infected rodents. The incubation period is 1-2 weeks; symptoms are nonspecifi c and include fever, chills, myalgia, headache, photophobia, anorexia, pharyngitis, and cough. CNS invasion is seen only in a few patients either after an initial febrile illness. During the neurologic phase, patients acquire aseptic meningitis and peripheral leukocytosis. CSF leukocyte cell counts are often greater than 1,000 cells /\u03bcL, and glucose levels are low. LCMV meningitis may be associated with an ascending paralysis, transverse myelitis, or encephalitis; overall case fatality is less than 1 % [ 88 ] .",

Prominent signs include an altered level of consciousness with or without focal neurologic signs or meningism (i.e., the triad of neck stiffness, photophobia, and headache) in the setting of an acute febrile illness. By and large, the differential diagnosis is the same as for acute bacterial or viral meningitis. Varying degrees of nuchal rigidity can be present in patients with encephalitis. Lumbar puncture yields CSF with a picture similar to that of viral meningitis. HSV, VZV, arboviruses, and enteroviruses can now be diagnosed by PCR analyses of CSF specimens. MRI imaging is a useful test for Adapted with permission from Rand et al. [ 521 ] ascertaining HSV encephalitis and for differentiating post infectious encephalomyelitis from viral encephalitis. It is important to recognize that some patients with arbovirus encephalitis, particularly Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus encephalitis, may have focal lesions by MRI ( Fig. 22 .14 ). However, the distribution of these lesions is not consistent and differs from the pattern seen on neuroimaging studies of HSV encephalitis ( Fig. 22.12a, b ) . Diagnosis of arbovirus encephalitis can almost always be made by serological testing as antibody titers to all of the common arboviruses are generally present by the time the patient presents with symptoms. Because there is only a very low background frequency of these antibodies in the general healthy population, a positive arbovirus serology can be accepted as clinically defi nitive of exposure or infection. The diagnosis of HSV encephalitis is of critical importance because of the effectiveness of acyclovir in improving patient outcomes. HSV is the most common cause of sporadic encephalitis. Patients with HSV type I encephalitis generally present with a 3-to 5-day history of fever, headache, and focal signs, including dysphasia and personality changes that may progress to obtundation and coma; the latter can occur abruptly and may be associated with the onset of seizures. HSV encephalitis can occur in any age group from childhood through old age at any time of the year-i.e., there is no characteristic seasonal variation pattern in occurrence. The incidence is estimated at 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 500,000 people per year; HSV encephalitis accounts for approximately 10-20 % of viral encephalitides in the United States.",

Because affected patients often do not have a history of having been bitten by an animal, a history of close contact with potentially infected animals, including bats, should be sought. Infection is almost always from inoculation but occasionally by inhalation. Rabies has been transmitted by corneal and solid organ allografts [ 96 , 97 ] . The virus is transmitted to the CNS via nerve trunks. Proliferation in nerve cells in the brain and peripheral ganglia leads to an invariably fatal meningoencephalitis. The incubation period varies anywhere from 2 weeks more than year. Proximal bites with a relatively large inoculum of virus tend to be associated with shorter incubation periods. The onset is rapid with fever, anxiety, insomnia, headache, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, and cough. The patient may complain of symptoms suggestive of paresthesia or fasciculation at the site of the original animal bite due to viral replication at the site of inoculation or in the dorsal ganglia of the sensory nerve supplying that area. The disease quickly progresses to an encephalitic phase consisting of agitation, excitation, and excessive motor activity. Patients may experience hallucinations, become combative, and develop muscle spasms with opisthotonus and involvement of the respiratory muscles. Painful spasms of the throat muscles, precipitated by attempts to swallow, may follow-this explains why patients tend to avoid drinking or swallowing. Spasms may be precipitated by mere air blowing onto the face; seizures are frequent. Periods of hallucinations and aberrant mentation may alternate with lucid periods that get progressively shorter as the disease progresses. Hyperesthesias with excessive reactivity to normal stimulation of light, sound, and touch are very common; autonomic nervous system changes such as dilated pupils, increased salivation, lacrimation, perspiration, and postural hypotension occur. Ultimately, brain stem function is affected with cranial nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and the characteristic hydrophobia due to the painful, violent involuntary contractions of the muscles of respiration and those in the pharynx and the larynx, initiated by attempts to swallow. Eventually the disease progresses to cardiorespiratory depression, coma, and death. Occasionally, rabies may present as an ascending paralysis clinically similar to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome; corneal transplants from two patients presumed to have died from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 actually 14 West Nile viral thalamic encephalitis T2-w mid-convexity brain section. Arbovirus (West Nile virus in this example) encephalitis typically has multicentric areas of cytogenic edema, which typically involve gray matter both in the cortex and in the central nuclear structures. The lesions are usually multicentric but not symmetric between hemispheres. In this example cytogenic edema is evident in the right thalamus and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The splenial abnormality can be from the virus but may also occur following recent seizure activity transmitted clinical rabies, resulting in the death of the recipients [ 98 , 99 ] . The laboratory diagnosis of rabies requires viral isolation, positive serology (assuming the patient has not been immunized), or demonstration of the characteristic Negri bodies in brain tissue. Laboratory diagnostic evaluation for rabies includes serological testing plus demonstration of viral antigen by IFA in infected tissue, including corneal scrapings, skin biopsies or brain biopsies, and analysis of CSF or saliva specimens for rabies virus antigen or RNA [ 100 ] . Survival of patients with rabies is rare; most of the few who have survived received the rabies vaccine prior to the onset of illness.",

B virus is also commonly referred to as herpes B, monkey B virus, herpesvirus simiae, and herpesvirus B. The virus is commonly found among macaque monkeys, including rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, and cynomolgus monkeys (also called crab-eating or long-tailed macaques), any of which can harbor latent B virus infection and appear to be natural hosts for the virus. Monkeys infected with B virus usually have no or only mild symptoms. In addition, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice can be experimentally infected with B virus. The virus is related to human HSV but humans have little native ability to contain it in contrast to its natural host in whom it produces \"cold sores.\" Human infection usually results from bites or scratches from macaques or mucocutaneous exposure to monkey saliva; laboratory personnel who work with ostensibly healthy monkeys or their tissues are particularly at risk. Indirect contact transmission, such as a needlestick injury with a contaminated needle has been documented. B virus is transmitted to humans from saliva in monkeys and reaches the brain via nerves at the site of the monkey bite. Patients acquire an ascending myelitis and fulminant meningoencephalitis, which leads to death. Infection is diagnosed by a rise in antibody titer or by isolating the virus from the CNS. There are seven different exposures for which postexposure prophylaxis is recommended: if postexposure prophylaxis is administered, it should be started soon (within hours) after the exposure. Neurologic tests should include lumbar puncture and MRI of the brain; electroencephalography (EEG) should also be considered. CSF samples should be sent for culture, PCR detection of viral DNA, and serologic testing. While use of intravenous acyclovir and ganciclovir therapy for patients with the early stages of B virus disease, including patients with early signs of CNS disease has been associated with increased survival for some patients, antiviral therapy has not been effective in patients with advanced encephalomyelitis [ 101 ] .",

Over the ensuing days this area of cerebritis becomes more localized with the development of necrosis in the middle and a ring-enhancing capsule. Ultimately, host defenses lead to the development of a well-formed fi brous capsule. The most common predisposing conditions for the development of a brain abscess are infections in the middle ear, paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and teeth (dental abscess). It is believed that bacteria reach the brain through valveless emissary veins, which traverse the cranium into the venous drainage system of the brain, or retrograde spread through the venous system. Alternatively, direct extension through an area of osteitis or osteomyelitis adjacent to the sinus or middle ear infection provides access to the CNS; chronic otitis media is a common predisposing factor with the abscesses most frequently forming in the temporal lobe or cerebellum. The other major mechanism by which the brain parenchyma becomes seeded is via metastatic transmission through the cerebral arteries from an extracranial focus of infection. Approximately 20 % of brain abscesses arise from a contiguous focus; 25 % are associated with hematogenous spread from a distant focus, such as a pyogenic lung abscess or bronchiectasis, and 25 % occur following trauma [ 105 -107 ] .",

In fact, any procedure that results in a transient bacteremia can on occasion be associated with the subsequent development of a brain abscess. Despite its chronicity and relatively high frequency of bacteremia, and involvement of the brain in 20-40 % of cases, endocarditis accounts for only 1-5 % of cases of brain abscess [ 108 , 109 ] . Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease are at increased risk of acquiring brain abscesses. A signifi cant number of brain abscesses are associated with penetrating trauma such as gunshot wounds, depressed skull fractures with retained with bone fragments, cranial penetration from objects such as pencils, animal bites, or even as a complication of cervical traction associated with pin-site infection. In patients with HIV infection, reactivation of toxoplasmosis can lead to brain abscesses. In approximately 25 % of cases no underlying etiology can be established.",

Each of these stages takes place in roughly 4 days, hence the rule of 4 s for intra-axial brain abscess. This evolution of brain abscess is predicated on a normal immune system and does not apply in the immunocompromised host. Success of treatment is measured by progressively diminishing crosssectional diameter of the abscess cavity. Radiologic changes in the abscess wall (i.e., thickness and contrast enhancement), surrounding edema, or status of internal contents are not reliable predictors of treatment success. Characteristic fi ndings of a brain abscess are a ring-enhancing lesion in the contrast CT or MRI studies with a hypodense center refl ecting the necrotic center of the abscess surrounded by a variable zone of edema [ 124 ] (Fig. 22.16a, b ) .",

Figure  ( a ) is a post-contrast T1-w sequence and the left image is an ADC map (apparent diffusion coeffi cient) sequence, which provides information as to the diffusibility of the free water in the area of abnormality. The post-contrast TD1-w sequence ( b ) demonstrates contiguous ringenhancing lesions in the right occipital brain. These fi ndings do not distinguish between tumors versus tumefactive lesions, especially abscess. The diffusion sensitive imaging demonstrates free motion restriction within the central portions of the lesion. This in tandem with enhanced images is typical of brain abscess. The purulent material within the abscess contains increased water content (hyper intense of T2-w sequences), but it does not allow the water molecule to diffuse as well as fl uid with the ventricles for instance. Hence, this ADC map shows the central water-restriction, often seen in pyogenic brain abscess CT imaging studies are especially useful in defi ning contiguous head and neck pathology, which can be the source of infection. High detail CT imaging can detect the bone lysis of aggressive sinusitis and otomastoiditis better than MRI. CT is also better at defi ning bone dehiscence associated with prior trauma, which can also be the source for intracranial infection. MRI and CT are comparable in defi ning retropharyngeal abscess and chronic fungal sinus and skull base infections. CT is less sensitive than MRI for characterizing the stages of cerebritis and abscess formation and for excluding other causes of intra axial necrotic masses in the brain [ 125 , 126 ] . MRI especially with diffusion brain imaging sequences maintains a high degree of sensitivity and specifi city; see following discussion. However, some abscess remain in a chronic sequestered state and are diffi cult to differentiate from tumor; these are included in the category of tumefactive lesions along with others such as sequestered infarcts, thrombosed giant aneurysms, and Balo variant of multiple sclerosis, to name three.",

In addition, there is no exposure to ionizing radiation, although the cost is substantially higher. On T1-weighted MRI scans, brain abscesses appear hypointense and show ring enhancement following administration of the contrast agent gadolinium. On T2-weighted sequences the central area of necrosis appears hyperintense and is surrounded by a well-defi ned hypointense capsule and readily discernible surrounding area of low density, representing cerebral edema. Another major advantage of MRI imaging studies is their ability to detect the cerebritis stage before the formation of the abscess with a fully developed capsule. The most helpful MR sequence is the diffusion techniques. This technique, most applicable once central necrosis has occurred, demonstrates the restriction of water movement within the forming fi brous abscess capsule. Other methods, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), can detect products of bacterial metabolism, such as lactate, acetate, or pyruvate, and may improve our ability to differentiate brain abscesses from malignancy [ 128 -130 ] .",

Lumbar puncture in a patient with a spaceoccupying lesion is absolutely contraindicated unless an MRI or CT scan has indicated that herniation is unlikely to occur following an LP and there is a clear clinical suspicion of meningitis or meningeal carcinomatosis to justify taking the risk. The CSF in patients with brain abscess generally shows fi ndings similar to any other parameningeal focus of infection, i.e., a pleocytosis with mixed neutrophils and lymphocytes, elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and a negative gram stain. CSF cultures are generally sterile, unless there is some anatomic connection between the abscess and the spinal fl uid as may occur in cases in which the brain abscess is secondary to trauma or to a postoperative complication; blood cultures are positive in 10-20 % of patients. While reasonable empiric therapy can be devised for most common brain abscesses, culture of the material and transport to the laboratory under strictly anaerobic conditions is essential for optimal identifi cation of the causative microorganism(s).

Stereotactic-guided needle aspiration of pus drains the collection and enables procurement of specimens for gram stain, culture, and histology. Open craniotomy may be considered in cases where response to antimicrobial therapy is poor or the organism isolated from culture is antimicrobial-resistant. Antimicrobial therapy alone may be considered for patients with numerous abscesses that are not amenable to surgical drainage or for patients with small abscesses who have stable neurologic function. The choice of antimicrobials is determined both by the spectrum of microbiological agents known to cause brain abscess and the degree to which individual antimicrobials penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter into the abscess cavity itself. For brain abscesses that develop in contiguity with frontal sinus infection, mixed aerobic and anaerobic fl ora may be assumed to be present. In this situation, even if anaerobic bacteria are not recovered, treatment should be given with high-dose penicillin 10-20 million units per day together with metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 h or 15 mg/kg IV every 12 h. If there is any suspicion that the abscess may have arisen from a dental focus, anaerobic cultures should be held for 7-14 days to enable detection of Actinomyces spp. growth. However, actinomycosis should respond to standard therapy with penicillin. Brain abscesses that are related to chronic otitis media and mastoiditis should be treated with a combination of antimicrobials that will cover anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae , and Pseudomonas spp. Thus, a combination of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole would work well in this clinical scenario. Although bacterial cultures may not always yield growth of anaerobes, particularly if the organisms are fastidious, the absence of growth of Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas spp. on culturing abscess material from a patient who has not received prior intravenous antimicrobial therapy can be relied upon to rule out these particular organisms as the cause of infection. Similarly, the absence of S . aureus from culture of abscess matter would also be very good evidence that this agent is not involved in the pathogenesis of the abscess. In general, S . aureus is much more likely to be implicated in endocarditis, metastatic infection to the CNS, or in the setting of trauma or postsurgical wound infection. If a brain abscess is associated with a neurosurgical procedure, vancomycin should be included in the empirical therapeutic regimen to cover both methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.",

With an incidence ranging between 0.3 cases per 100,000 among persons less than or equal to 20 years of age and 6.5 per 100,000 among persons greater than 70 years of age, vertebral osteomyelitis is the most common type of hematogenously acquired osteomyelitis [ 156 , 157 , 159 , 161 ] . The condition occurs more frequently in men, especially those aged 50 years or older [ 157 , 162 , 164 , 165 ] . Risk factors associated with spontaneous, acute vertebral osteomyelitis include diabetes mellitus, systemic steroid use, history of a genital or urinary infection, urinary tract procedures, bacteremia, protein calorie malnutrition, IV drug abuse, malignancy, various immunodefi cient states, or advanced age [ 156 , 157 , 165 -168 ] . images include post-contrast T1-w (on left ) and T2-w (on right ) sequences.

In adults, the nidus of infection begins in the vertebral bodies at the level of the end arteriolar arcades and, after endplate destruction, spreads secondarily into the avascular disc space [ 156 , 168 ] . In children, the disc space contains vascular channels that allow primary seeding of the intervertebral disc [ 156 , 168 , 169 ] . Segmental spinal arteries typically bifurcate to supply adjacent vertebral segments, this bifurcation is thought to account for the fact that vertebral osteomyelitis typically involves two adjacent vertebrae and the intervening disc space [ 168 ] . Postoperative vertebral osteomyelitis usually occurs due to direct inoculation of the microorganism at the time of surgery [ 156 , 157 , 161 , 164 , 167 , 169 ] .

Blood cultures are critical in the workup of a patient with a putative diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis and, if positive (up to 78 % of blood cultures are positive), might obviate the need for an invasive diagnostic procedure to procure a biopsy specimen [ 157 , 165 , 178 ] . Plain X-ray fi ndings include disc space narrowing and vertebral end plate changes that usually become apparent 2-4 weeks after symptom onset in approximately 80 % of patients [ 156 , 157 , 167 , 191 ] . Technetium 99 m bone scanning combined with gallium scanning has a 90 % sensitivity and specifi city for vertebral osteomyelitis [ 193 ] . MRI imaging is the most sensitive and specifi c imaging modality for vertebral osteomyelitis and has the added benefi t of providing details regarding the presence of an epidural or paraspinal abscess and various other complications [ 156 , 161 , 194 -196 ] . Characteristic MRI changes include decreased T1 signal and increased T2 signal of the involved vertebral endplates and disc space [ 156 , 196 ] (Fig. 22.18 ). Positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning with 18F-fl uorodeoxyglucose has a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of MRI and might be considered if the patient has metallic implants [ 195 ] . Optimal pharmacologic treatment requires that the infecting microbe be identifi ed and antimicrobial susceptibility profi le be determined [ 157 ] . If imaging is suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis but blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth, then a biopsy of the infected vertebra is mandatory [ 156 , 157 , 167 , 191 ] . The procedure of choice would depend on the presence of underlying intrinsic patient risk factors with input from surgical and interventional radiology personnel regarding CT-guided versus open biopsy [ 161 ] . When blood cultures are negative, a CT-guided needle biopsy can be used to make a defi nitive microbiological diagnosis 60-90 % of the time [ 157 ] . An open biopsy should be considered when both blood cultures and CT-guided aspirates are negative [ 167 ] . A skin test for tuberculosis should be placed in all patients and CT aspirates or biopsy material should be sent for routine fungal stains and cultures [ 167 , 192 ] . If polymicrobial osteomyelitis is suspected (e.g., a patient with concomitant intra-abdominal sepsis), a biopsy should be performed whether or not blood cultures are positive for bacterial growth [ 181 ] .",

But later, after a phase of lymphocytic proliferation, granulomata with caseating centers become a prominent feature (Fig. 22.19 ). Another feature of tuberculous infection of the meninges is involvement of the blood vessels traversing the meninges: small-and medium-sized arteries are most often involved, although capillaries and veins may be similarly affected. The changes include granuloma formation and infl ammation of the adventitia, which causes a reactive cellular proliferation of the intima, which in turn may lead to occlusion of the vessel and infarction of the areas supplied by the vessel. Clinically, this vasculitis is frequently found in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery due to its anatomic location at the base of the brain, where the infl ammatory response is most intense. This profound infl ammatory response with vasculitis causes compression of neural tissues and compromises cerebral blood fl ow leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, obstruction of CSF free fl ow, resulting in hydrocephalus and cerebral edema.",

Thus, direct nucleic acid amplifi cation tests should always be performed in conjunction with microscopy and culture, and each test result must be interpreted within the overall clinical setting in which it is used.

Treatment must be continued for at least 12 months. INH is generally used at a dose of 300 mg/day in adults or 10 mg/kg/day in children. The most serious side effect is hepatitis, which ranges from asymptomatic enzyme elevations to fulminant hepatic necrosis. The true risk of INH side effects is approximately 0.1 % among those receiving INH alone for prophylaxis and greater than 1 % for those receiving INH as part of a treatment regimen for tuberculosis [ 270 ] . The incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher in persons over 35 years of age, as well as those with other conditions affecting liver function such as alcoholism and viral hepatitis. The dose of rifampin is 600 mg/day and is only infrequently associated with side effects such as a fl u-like syndrome and a hypersensitivity reaction with renal, hepatic, and hematologic toxicity. Pyrazinamide is given in a dose of 25 mg/kg/ day and has a relatively low incidence of side effects; there is little added toxicity when combined with INH and rifampin. INH, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide all have good penetration of the CSF. Ethambutol is generally administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg for the fi rst 1-2months of treatment with a reduction in dose to approximately 15 mg/kg/ day because of the risk of optic neuritis, seen in approximately 25 % of patients. The fi rst clue to the development of this complication is loss of red-green vision or diminished visual acuity; ophthalmologic consultation is suggested in these situations. Streptomycin was one of the fi rst drugs found to be active against tuberculosis and is commonly administered in a dose of 20-40 mg/kg/day for children and 1 g/day for adults. Unfortunately, the irreversible ototoxicity is so frequent that it is not advisable to use this agent unless absolutely necessary. Second-line antituberculous drugs such as para-aminosalicylic (PAS), cycloserine, ethionamide, kanamycin, and amikacin should only be used based on treatment failure with primary agents and antimicrobial susceptibility studies. Of these agents, ethionamide and cycloserine penetrate well into the CNS.",

However, other fungal meningitides cannot be totally ruled out, and some patients may have to be placed on empirical therapy with both antituberculous medications and amphotericin B. Occasionally, CNS symptomatology in patients treated in this fashion turn out to have a noninfectious etiology; in these patients, further radiographic or invasive diagnostic studies may be indicated.

Other factors correlating with poor response to therapy include age and coexistent miliary disease. The earliest sign of response to therapy in most cases is reduction in peak daily temperatures within the fi rst 1-2 weeks and subjective improvement in fatigue and malaise over the same period. However, early studies pointed out that it was not uncommon for some markers of disease, such as the presence of bacilli in a smear of the CSF or a rise in CSF protein, to occur shortly after the initiation of treatment. In general, the glucose level in the CSF rises with successful treatment while the protein returns to normal more slowly, a process that may take as long as 6 months.",

The pathogenesis of tuberculomas is similar to that of tuberculous meningitis in that a tuberculous granuloma, seeded during the phase of acquiring the primary infection, breaks down and, because of its location within the brain parenchyma, produces a mass lesion rather than meningitis. Patients may present with fever, headache, focal or generalized seizure, or change in mental status and may manifest signs of proptosis, papilledema, or transient neurologic defi cits. Clinical features are related to the anatomic location of the tuberculoma. Generally, patients have a single lesion on presentation. However autopsy series and sophisticated radiologic studies have shown that in up to 70 % of patients, multiple lesions are present. The duration of symptoms prior to presentation is somewhat longer than in tuberculous meningitis, averaging weeks to months with occasional patients having symptoms for years prior to diagnosis. In fact, 30 % of patients with tuberculomas may remain asymptomatic throughout their life. Neuroimaging CT scan and MRI have a 100 % diagnostic sensitivity (Fig. 22.21 ) ; however, tissue confi rmation is essential in order to rule out malignancies or other ring-enhancing, space-occupying lesions, such as pyogenic bacterial abscesses, neurocysticercosis, or toxoplasmosis [ 124 , 260 ] .",

These two species differ in their ecology, distribution in nature, epidemiology, presentation, clinical course, and therapy. C . neoformans var neoformans is found worldwide and produces most of the infections in patients in the United States, while C . neoformans var gattii is a more commonly found in Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and parts of Southern California. The most important determinant of CNS infection caused by Cryptococcus spp. is the immune status of the host. This can be most easily demonstrated by the marked increase in the number of cases associated with HIV infection and the fact that as the CD4+ count decreases the incidence of cryptococcal infection increases markedly, particularly at CD4+ counts less than 200 cells/mm 3 . Although a variety of virulence factors have been described in Cryptococcus spp. infections, such as the production of the pigment melanin, its thick polysaccharide capsule is probably the most important virulence factor that protects the fungus from phagocytosis by the host.",

The test is positive in over 90 % of HIV-infected patients, but in only 50 % of patients with normal immunity. Several latex agglutination tests have been developed that detect the excess polysaccharide capsule produced in the spinal fl uid of patients with cryptococcal meningitis. This test is positive in over 95 % of patients with the condition. While the test is highly reliable, it is important to recognize that there can be both false-negative and false-positive reactions. For example, HIV-infected patients with overwhelming cryptococcal meningitis may have so much polysaccharide capsule in their CSF that a \"prozone\" effect occurs, resulting in the fi nding that undiluted CSF or CSF tested at a 1:2 dilution may appear negative. Generally, upon dilution of the spinal fl uid to 1:10 or greater, a positive reaction will be observed. Laboratories must be aware of this prozone effect and physicians who suspect cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients should alert the laboratory to ensure that this possibility is not overlooked. In addition, cross-reactions with Trichosporon beigelii or Capnocytophaga may occasionally produce false-positive latex agglutination tests. The latex agglutination should be confi rmed by growth of cryptococci in culture. If a positive cryptococcal antigen titer is found in the CSF from a patient for whom CSF culture did not yielded growth of Cryptococcus spp., the antigen test cannot be assumed to be false-positive-a large volume (10-20 mL) of CSF should be obtained for repeating the cryptococcal antigen test and reculturing for cryptococcus. The higher the cryptococcal antigen titer, the less likely it is to be a false-positive result. CSF changes in cryptococcal meningitis generally parallel those of chronic tuberculous meningitis and other chronic meningitides (Table 22. 2 ). CSF analysis is typically abnormal as follows: glucose is generally less than 40 mg/dL, protein is elevated in the large majority of patients, and the white count is usually elevated with a lymphocytic predominance. Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis depends in part on host susceptibility factors. In patients with no underlying chronic illness or history of HIV infection, IV amphotericin B at a dose of 0.5-0.8 mg/kg/day together with oral fl ucytosine 37.5 mg/kg every 8 h should be administered until the patient becomes afebrile and culture-negative; generally, this takes approximately 6 weeks. This should probably be followed by a course of fl uconazole 400 mg/day for an additional 2-3 months. Flucytosine may cause severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, which, in turn, may develop as a result of amphotericin therapy. Therefore, patients need to be monitored carefully for these particular toxic side effects. Some authorities recommend measuring fl ucytosine levels and adjusting the dose to give a peak of 70-80 mcg/L and a trough of 30-40 mcg/L. However, services for routine measurement of these levels may not be readily available at many hospitals. Alternative therapeutic regimens include various lipid-soluble amphotericin B preparations, which may be used for patients who develop nephrotoxicity. If the patient is intolerant to fl ucytosine, therapy with amphotericin B at a higher dose of 0.7-1 mg/kg/day for 6-8 weeks may be considered. Fluconazole 400 mg/day orally for 8-10 weeks may be curative, particularly in non-immunocompromised patients who are less ill. However, it should be recognized that fl uconazole alone is less effective than the combination of amphotericin B plus fl ucytosine: the length of time that CSF cultures remain positive is longer and rates of treatment failure tend to be higher for fl uconazole-only therapeutic regimens.

In vitro, the mold phase is characterized by both macro-and microconidia.

Symptoms of CNS involvement are secondary to intracranial mass lesions, isolated chronic meningitis with or without other manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis or meningitis. Some patients may have CNS disease secondary to emboli from histoplasma endocarditis.

Factors that predispose to C . immitis dissemination and the development of meningitis include immunosuppression due to HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, and non-Caucasian race [ 289 ] .",

In patients who do not respond to the 400 mg/day dose of fl uconazole, higher doses may be used, otherwise options are limited. If there is no response to azole therapy, amphotericin B at a dose of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/day may be given intrathecally, optimally through an Ommaya reservoir. Intravenous amphotericin B has poor CSF penetration and has a limited role in the management of coccidioidal meningitis [ 289 ] . Recent studies on rabbit models suggest that lipid preparations of amphotericin B tend to have better penetration of brain parenchyma and meninges and might be effective in treating coccidioidal meningitis. However, such studies have yet to be duplicated in humans [ 293 , 294 ] . With the demonstration of rising CSF glucose and falling white cell count and protein, this schedule of amphotericin B administration may be decreased to three times a week after 2-3 weeks of daily treatment, and maintenance may be achieved with twice weekly or once weekly injections. Treatment with either oral fl uconazole or intrathecal amphotericin B must be prolonged for at least 2 years after the spinal fl uid becomes completely normal. In patients with HIV infection, therapy is continued for life. Patients who have disseminated extrapulmonary disease in addition to meningitis should also receive systemic amphotericin at 0.6-1.0 mg/ kg/day for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/kg every other day, to a total dose of 2.5-3 g. The amphotericin should then be followed by oral fl uconazole 400 mg/day for up to a year after the course of amphotericin. It should be noted that the response rate is by no means 100 % in either meningitis or disseminated disease, and that relapses are not uncommon even in patients who respond initially.",

On occasion, C . immitis may actually grow in the shunt and cause obstruction. Patients who have a ventricular shunt in place cannot be administered intrathecal amphotericin B in an Ommaya reservoir. Rather, Amphotericin B must be administered intrathecally via intracisternal puncture or lateral neck injection under radiographic guidance.

(2) Candida meningitis that occurs together with disseminated microabscesses or alone as chronic meningitis with a dense exudate at the base of the brain and brain stem. Microscopic examination reveals changes consistent with granulomatous meningitis, sometimes with yeasts and hyphae; the onset is usually subacute with fever and headache [ 313 , 315 ] . A cerebral CT scan might reveal hydrocephalus and CSF culture invariably yields the microorganism. (3) Cerebral macroabscesses are less frequent and may result in seizures and focal neurological signs; diagnosis is based on neuroimaging studies and biopsy [ 316 ] .

            "text": "Zygomycosis is the term used to describe infection caused any of the zygomycetes-Absidia , Rhizopus , and Mucor . These saprophytic organisms are ubiquitous in the environment, especially soil and commonly found on bread. The genuses Absidia , Rhizopus , and Mucor can invade the CNS by direct extension or from hematogenous spread. Disseminated disease occurring via the hematogenous route may produce CNS mucormycosis resulting in infarction and abscess formation. The Zygomycetes tend to invade the paranasal sinuses or palate with subsequent progression through tissue, nerves, blood vessels, and fascial planes, followed by the vital structures at the base of the brain (Fig. 22.24a, b ) . In patients with diabetes, this disease typically presents as rhinocerebral mucor (Fig. 22.25 ) . Patients are generally predisposed to this complication if their serum glucose has remained uncontrolled, and the patient has been acidotic for several weeks. Initial symptoms usually include sinus pain, headache, fever, and nasal stuffi ness and discharge, which quickly progresses to facial cellulitis, swelling, proptosis, carotid artery occlusion, cavernous sinus thrombosis, CNS infarction due to fungal thrombosis, CNS hemorrhage, abscess, cerebritis, blindness, and airway obstruction caused by head and neck infections. Death ensues if the condition is not treated. Other at-risk populations include persons who have been neutropenic for more than 2-3 weeks, iron overload, burns, HIV infection and AIDS, blood dyscrasias, transplantation, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, IV drug abuse, and high-dose steroids. Patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis may manifest hyperglycemia and a metabolic acidosis. Lumbar puncture and CSF analysis invariably reveal a raised opening pressure, a neutrophilic pleocytosis, normal or slightly elevated protein levels, and low glucose levels. In most cases, however, CSF study fi ndings are normal [ 318 ] . Neuroimaging studies help to support the diagnosis of rhinocerebral mucormycosis and to precisely determine the extent of disease. CT scanning and MRI reveal soft tissue extent of infection, mucosal thickening, and bony destruction of the sinuses and orbit, presence of cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebritis, and cerebral edema (Fig. 22.25 ) . Tissue biopsy is necessary to demonstrate the invasive hyphae. The Zygomycetes all appear as ribbon-like nonseptate hyphae in tissue with right-or obtuse-angle branching (Fig. 22.24b ) . Treatment of the condition is based on three main principles: rapid reversal of underlying predisposing factors, antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, and timely surgical intervention. Treatment includes control of the underlying predisposing condition (e.g., control of diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoxia, and electrolyte abnormalities), IV amphotericin B in a dose of at least 1 mg/kg/day, together with vigorous surgical debridement of a b all involved tissue. Dexamethasone has been used to treat brain edema. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis carries a prognosis of high morbidity and mortality. Survival depends on the reversibility of underlying risk factors and early surgical intervention [ 319 ] .",

Invasive aspergillosis can occur in patients with preexisting bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, or in persons who are immunosuppressed (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients). Patients with prolonged and profound neutropenia (less than 100 cells /\u03bcL) are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis. Colonization with Aspergillus spp. can lead to tissue invasion with branching septate hyphae that are best visualized in tissue with silver stains and histologically distinct from other fungi-i.e., Aspergillus spp. have frequent septae that branch at 45\u00b0 angles. Lung invasion can involve blood vessels leading to hematogenous spread. The majority of invasive CNS infections occur in immunosuppressed transplant patients in the hospital who had pulmonary disease that progressed to brain involvement via hematogenous dissemination. Compared with persons with uncontrolled diabetes who are more susceptible to infections caused by mucor, patients with prolonged neutropenia appear to be more susceptible to invasive Aspergillus spp. sinus infection with direct extension from the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with progression to cavernous sinus thrombosis. Voriconazole which has good CNS tissue penetration is usually fi rst-line therapy with surgical debridement of all infected tissue.

Primary infection occasionally is associated with acute cerebral or disseminated disease. T . gondii causes latent infection in a signifi cant proportion (10-90 %) of the world's population but uncommonly causes clinically signifi cant disease [ 322 ] . In addition, T . gondii infects numerous wild and domestic animals. Human infection generally occurs through the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat that contains cysts, or by the ingestion of food or water contaminated by the oocysts shed in the stool of infected animals. In the United States, the major animal reservoir for this infection is the domestic cat. The life cycle is complex. The sexual phase of the cycle takes place in the cat with formation of oocysts in the mucosal lining of the intestine for approximately 3 weeks after initial infection. During this time, as many as ten million oocysts may be shed daily. Oocysts require 1-5 days to become infectious after being shed by the cat, a process that depends on temperature and availability of oxygen. During intestinal infection, the tachyzoite form of the organism, a 2-4 \u03bcm wide by 4-8 \u03bcm long crescent-like structure, is produced and disseminates to many different areas in the host. Wide ranges of intermediate hosts ingest the oocysts, which form latest cysts in many tissues, including muscle. In humans, as in many domestic and wild animals, this dissemination is asymptomatic and results in the formation of cysts in brain parenchyma as well as muscle and numerous other organs. Transmission to humans is a result of exposure to excreta from cats, ingestion of undercooked infected meat, or from contaminated water supplies. Serologic surveys in the United States show that approximately 15 % of the general population have been infected with toxoplasmosis at some time in the past [ 323 ] . In contrast, the prevalence is much higher in economically underdeveloped countries and in certain parts of Europe where rates may range as high as 75 %. Although reactivation of toxoplasmosis in the brain generally leads to local replication with the production of single or multiple abscesses, hematogenous dissemination and infection in the lung and in other parts of the body have been documented. The incidence and attributable mortality in Europe and the United States have decreased substantially since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy and the broad use of prophylaxis regimens active against T . gondii .",

In immunocompromised patients, reactivation of latent disease can cause life-threatening encephalitis. Patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis generally present with a syndrome of fever, headache and varying degrees of confusion, lethargy, obtundation, focal neurologic signs developing over a period of 1-3 weeks, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. In some patients, the presentation can be abrupt, with seizures or cerebral hemorrhage. Hemiparesis and abnormalities of speech are quite common. Less commonly, brain stem involvement may result in cranial nerve defi cits, while dyskinesias such as Parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, and hemiballismus may also accompany the presenting syndromes.

If there is no clinical or radiographic response within 10 days, alternative diagnoses and brain biopsy must be considered. Reactivation of latent infection in the CNS is a common HIV/AIDS-related complication. Thus, current guidelines recommend that patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis should be treated with the initial regimen for 4-6 weeks, depending upon the degree and rapidity of improvement, and then receive lifelong suppression with sulfadiazine 500-1,000 mg orally four times daily and with pyrimethamine 25-75 mg and folinic acid 10-20 mg both by mouth daily. Patients on long-term maintenance treatment for cerebral toxoplasmosis have a low risk for subsequently developing a b Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This decreased risk is thought to be the result of chronic suppressive treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides [ 330 ] . More recent data suggest that discontinuation of maintenance therapy against toxoplasmic encephalitis for individuals infected with HIV/ AIDS, who are receiving successful antiretroviral therapy, might be safe and that patients who remain clinically and radiologically free of relapse at 6 months after discontinuation are unlikely to experience a relapse of toxoplasmic encephalitis [ 331 , 332 ] . However, the overall body of published data in support of a policy that recommends discontinuing secondary prophylaxis remains relatively limited at the present time.",

Serologic surveys in the general adult population show a seroprevalence rate ranging between 50 and 80 %, depending upon the socioeconomic status and the particular group studied; the seroprevalence of CMV rises with age. Approximately 10 % of all infants born in the United States either have CMV infection at birth or acquire it within the neonatal period. The vast majority of these infections is asymptomatic and result from exposure to reactivated virus that is transmitted transplacentally in seropositive mothers. Subsequently, both children and adults may become infected through exposure to infected urine often from infants in day care; the virus may also be acquired from sexual contact, generally during the late teens and twenties, or by respiratory droplet infection. In nonimmunocompromised adults, primary CMV infection is clinically identical to that of infectious mononucleosis and runs a self-limited course of 2-3 weeks characterized by fever, fatigue, malaise, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, and elevated liver enzymes, together with atypical lymphocytes in the blood smear.",

Very little tissue damage is associated with these lesions [ 333 ] . The microglial nodular disease may involve multiple parts of the brain including the periventricular areas.

Patients with either type of encephalopathy may complain of headaches and have seizures. CSF examination in these conditions reveals a slightly elevated protein, which tends to be lower in microglial nodular encephalitis, averaging approximately 60 mg/dL as compared with 172 mg/dL in ventriculoencephalitis.

In the fi rst mechanism, HIV and its fragments induce damage directly or indirectly through the accumulation of infected or activated macrophage and microglia cells that release neurotoxic mediators including both cellular activation products and viral proteins [ 345 , 346 ] . The accumulation of these activated macrophage/microglia cells, some of which are infected, release a number of cytokines and small molecule mediators and viral proteins that act on bystander cells. These viral proteins and cellular products have neurotoxic properties and act directly and through induction of astrocyte dysfunction, leading to neuronal injury [ 346 -348 ] . The second, less predominant, pathogenic mechanism is the ability of HIV to impair neurogenesis [ 349 , 350 ] .

Most of the deaths and serious complications of malaria, especially CNS involvement, are caused by P . falciparum . Malaria sporozoites are transmitted from the female Anopheles mosquito to the patient at the time the mosquito bites a person for its blood meal. Sporozoites are carried rapidly to the liver where they multiply in approximately 1 week to become tissue schizonts or the dormant hypnozoites produced by P . vivax and P . ovale . Infected liver cells then burst, releasing thousands of merozoites, each of which in turn infects red blood cells in the blood stream. Continued asexual replication in the bloodstream through repeated cycles of maturation and rupture of red cells with release of merozoites eventually results in symptomatic infection. During this process, some of the parasites develop into sexual forms called gametocytes which produce no symptoms themselves but which may circulate for a prolonged period of time. It is the ingestion of these gametocytes that leads to the sexual reproduction cycle in the Anopheles mosquito resulting in the motile sporozoites which invade the mosquito salivary glands and can be transmitted back to humans at the time of the next feeding.",

Cerebral malaria, in particular, is the most prominent and serious of these complications. Attributable mortality remains relatively high (20 %) and is often associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment. As P . falciparum trophozoites mature in the red blood cells, they induce the formation of small knobs on the surface of the red cell. These knobs bind to adhesion molecules (also known as intercellular adhesion molecule-1) on the microvascular endothelial cells, leading to sequestration. Sequestration is the process whereby erythrocytes containing mature forms of P . falciparum adhere to microvascular endothelial cells resulting in marked reduction or disappearance of these cells from the circulation. Sequestration of erythrocytes in small blood vessels and consequent obstruction of microcirculatory fl ow is a specifi c property of P falciparum and an important mechanism causing coma and death in cerebral malaria. The second important factor in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is the increase in cytokine production . In an attempt to control the infection, the host immune system produces a potent proinfl ammatory response in which cells of the macrophage-monocyte series are induced to release various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 [ 353 ] . However, this response may also induce complications, such as severe anemia, hypoglycemia, and cerebral malaria.",

Furthermore, parasitized erythrocytes tend to adhere to adjacent uninfected cells leading to rosetting. In addition, as the parasite matures inside the erythrocyte, the normally fl exible cell becomes more spherical and rigid. Because of the rosetting and increased rigidity of parasitized erythrocytes, the erythrocytes become trapped in the capillaries. The end result of cytoadherence, rosetting, and rigidity is the enhancement of sequestration of P . falciparum -parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral vasculature, stagnation of the cerebral blood fl ow, and secondary ischemia leading to tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and prevention of delivery of nutrients to the tissues. High concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 can precipitate cerebral malaria by increasing the sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes. Although all tissues potentially can become involved, the brain is the most profoundly affected [ 354 -362 ] .",

Once the diagnosis is considered likely, parenteral quinidine gluconate should be started. The recommended therapeutic regimen includes a loading dose of 6.25 mg base/kg (=10 mg salt/kg) infused intravenously over 1-2 h followed by a continuous infusion of 0.0125 mg base/kg/min (=0.02 mg salt/kg/min). An alternative regimen is an intravenous loading dose of 15 mg base/ kg (=24 mg salt/kg) of quinidine gluconate infused intravenously over 4 h, followed by 7.5 mg base/kg (=12 mg/kg salt) infused over 4 h every 8 h, starting 8 h after the loading dose.

Acanthamoeba spp. are usually found in soil and in fresh and brackish water. Most cases in the United States, typically children or young adults, occur in the southeastern states. Clinically, patients present with sudden onset of high fever, photophobia, and headaches; progression to obtundation occurs relatively quickly. There is usually a classic history of swimming or waterskiing in warm, freshwater lakes. The amoebae invade the nasal cavity along the blood vessels associated with the olfactory nerves and traverse the cribriform plate to reach the frontal lobes and the surrounding meninges, where they rapidly produce a highly necrotizing, purulent, and destructive encephalitis. Because of the olfactory involvement, there may be alterations of smell or taste.

Neurocysticercosis in adults results from infection of the brain with the larval cysts of the cestode, Taenia solium , the pork tapeworm. Human infection occurs by two different mechanisms: [ 1 ] ingestion of the eggs leading to embryonation of the eggs and penetration of the intestinal wall with hematogenous transport of cysticerci to many different tissues, primarily muscle and brain, where they encyst and remain potentially infectious for long period of time. Alternatively, ingestion of undercooked pork can result in ingestion of the cysticerci by humans. In the latter instance the cysticerci mature into the typical tapeworm which attaches to the intestine and may grow to lengths of up to 3 m and live for up to 25 years. During this time it produces egg-fi lled segments, called proglottids, which are excreted in the feces.

Patients with inactive parenchymal neurocysticercosis generally have no evidence of viable or degenerating parasites; the utility of antiparasitic drugs in these patients remains limited. However, these patients are at increased risk of developing seizures, and standard anticonvulsive therapy with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine is indicated. Patients who develop hydrocephalus need to be treated with ventricular peritoneal shunting. Virtually all patients with active neurocysticercosis have seizures, which must be treated with anticonvulsants. Probably the majority of these patients can be treated symptomatically and followed by MRI because the c b d Fig. 22 . 29 (continued) cysticerci typically undergo complete degeneration over a 1to 2-year period. This process results in either calcifi ed inactive cysticerci that continue to induce seizures thereby requiring continued therapy with anticonvulsants or, in a majority, a normal MRI in which case anticonvulsants may be tapered as long as the patients remain seizure free.",

Albendazole has been superior to praziquantel in trials comparing the efficacy of these drugs [ 376 , 377 , 379 ] . Another advantage of albendazole is that it also destroys subarachnoid and ventricular cysts [ 380 , 381 ] . In some of these cases, particularly in patients with large subarachnoid cysts, higher doses (up to 30 mg/kg/day) or more prolonged, or even repeated, courses of albendazole may be needed. Although these agents kill the cysticerci, some controlled trials have not shown any clinical benefi t over symptomatic treatment alone [ 382 -384 ] . The main adverse side effect of praziquantel is worsening neurologic function, i.e., headaches, dizziness, seizures, and increased ICP probably as a result of an increase in the host infl ammatory response and cerebral edema due to the larval death. There is a strong consensus that there is no role for anti-cysticidal drugs in patients with only calcifi ed lesions and those patients with single enhancing lesions will do well regardless of antiparasitic therapy [ 385 ] . Riley and White point out that while antiparasitic therapy is indicated in patients with multiple subarachnoid cysticerci or giant cysticerci they are contraindicated in patients with cerebral edema (cysticercal encephalitis) [ 385 ] .",

Patients with intracranial hydatid cysts usually present with focal neurological defi cit and features of raised intracranial pressure due to interference with CSF fl ow. The treatment of hydatid cyst is surgical and the aim of the surgery is to excise the cyst in toto without rupture to prevent recurrence and anaphylactic reaction. Albendazole therapy is given in a daily dose of 10 mg/kg, taken three times for 4 months. It is a broad-spectrum oral antihelminthic drug, which acts by blocking glucose uptake of the larva and adult worm.

Normally, the adult worms bore into the mucosa and produce eggs, which pass out with stool. The eggs deposited by the female may hatch the rhabditiform larvae that enter the lumen of the intestine to be passed out in stool. Eggs released from these organisms normally mature in the soil to produce more rhabditiform larvae. In the environment, these larvae transform to the fi lariform infective larvae that can directly penetrate intact skin of humans and other mammals. For reasons not fully understood, in some patients the transformation from rhabditiform to the fi lariform infective larvae can also occur while still in the lower bowel or perianal area, before being passed out in the stool. The fi lariform larvae burrow through the intestinal wall and perianal skin to reinfect the patient, a phenomenon known as autoinfection. After burrowing through the skin, the fi lariform larvae enter the lymphatics and, ultimately, the venous system where they are carried to the pulmonary capillaries. Here, they migrate out of the blood vessels into alveoli, up the airways and then down through the esophagus to reach the small bowel. Symptoms include ground itch, urticarial, and pulmonary symptoms. A worm burden in the intestines might lead to a malabsorption syndrome.

Although an eosinophilia is common in strongyloidiasis, it is almost never seen in patients with the hyperinfection syndrome because of existing immunosuppression (usually corticosteroids) and is an indication of poor prognosis-the lower the eosinophil count, the worse the prognosis.

Patients with meningovascular syphilis generally present with a history of several weeks to months of prodromal symptoms and signs, such as headache, vertigo, personality changes, behavioral changes, insomnia or seizures, and stroke-like neurologic defi cits, most frequently involving the distribution of vessels in the territory of the middle cerebral artery followed by that of the basilar artery. Thus, while the distribution of strokes in such patients may be similar to that of the patient with atherosclerotic disease, the occlusive symptoms develop gradually over a period of time in meningeal vascular syphilis as opposed to sudden onset in patients with atherosclerotic strokes [ 401 ] . In contrast to the fi ndings from the preantibiotic era, neurosyphilis is now most often identifi ed in young patients with HIV coinfection [ 402 , 403 ] .",

This category includes two classical syndromes: general paresis and tabes dorsalis. In contradistinction to the pathogenesis of syphilitic meningitis or meningovascular syphilis, these syndromes result from progressive neuronal destruction with fi brosis and atrophy rather than ischemic damage from vasculitis. General paresis, also known as general paralysis of the insane, is a chronic progressive meningoencephalitis with a peak incidence 10-20 years after acquisition of syphilis. Patients generally present with gradual deterioration of mental functioning characterized by diffi culties in concentration, irritability, and defi cits of higher cognitive function. As the condition progresses, these manifestations become more obvious and symptoms may mimic psychiatric disease, including delusions, paranoia, emotional lability, memory loss, or dementia. Diffi culties with motor control then develop with a loss of facial muscle and extremity tone, loss of fi ne motor control, and the development of tremors and dysarthria. Subsequently, patients may have seizures, loss of bowel and bladder control, and paralysis; the pupils become unresponsive to light and painful stimuli and may be constricted and unequal in size (the Argyll Robertson pupil). Untreated, the disease follows a progressive or subacute course over 3-4 years. Pathologically there is diffuse cortical atrophy, dilatation of the ventricles, and neuronal dropout with accompanying gliosis. Spirochetes can be demonstrated in 25-40 % of patients with silver stain. The diagnosis is established by a combination of the clinical presentation, positive serology, and elevated CSF white count and protein.",

It has a peak incidence that is generally later than that of paresis, approximately 15-20 years after infection, and the progression of this condition is somewhat slower than that of paresis. The classical early symptomatology is \"lightning pains\" in the distribution of nerve roots. These pains are described as lancinating, lasting for minutes to hours, and most often involve the lower extremities. Ten percent to 20 % of patients with tabes may also present with episodic attacks of abdominal pain. In addition to pain, some patients experience episodic paresthesias. Ultimately, patients experience progressive loss of vibration and pro-prioceptive sensation, particularly in the lower extremities. As a result, the patients exhibit a characteristic broad-based, shuffl ing gait and may develop Charcot joints. Muscular atrophy develops in approximately 20 % of patients. The Argyll Robertson pupil, in which one or both pupils constrict with accommodation but do not react directly to light, is a characteristic feature of both general paresis and tabes dorsalis. Pathologically there is atrophy of the posterior columns of the spinal cord with infl ammatory infi ltrates and loss of neurons. In contrast to paresis, it is unusual to be able to stain the spirochete in nerve tissue. The diagnosis is readily made from the characteristic neurologic fi ndings together with positive serology. However, CSF leukocytosis is observed in only 50 % of patients, and protein elevation is seen in approximately 53 % of patients.",

Patients with lesions on moist skin or mucous membranes during either primary or secondary syphilis can usually be diagnosed by the demonstration of treponemes on dark-fi eld microscopy. While treponemes can be demonstrated in dry lesions or lymph nodes by biopsy or saline aspiration, the yield is considerably lower. Serologic tests for syphilis are generally divided into two different types: nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests measure IgG or IgM antibodies directed at cardiolipin, which is released when the treponeme damages cells during an infection. Thus, a positive nontreponemal test is indicative of an active infection, but a confi rmatory test with a treponemal test is required to verify that it is indeed a syphilis infection that is causing elevated cardiolipin levels. Currently, a standardized mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol, and lecithin which has fewer falsepositive reactions is used and forms the basis of today's standardized tests. The most common of these are the classic venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), in which agglutination of the cardiolipin, cholesterol, and lecithin antigen is carried out on a slide using heated serum; the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test; the automated reagin test (ART); or the toluidine red unheated test (TRUST). Because of the stringency of the technical requirements for the test, the VDRL is generally performed only on CSF and serum screening tests are generally done with the RPR and its variants. Specifi c treponemal tests for syphilis include the T . pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test, the microhemagglutination test with T . pallidum antigen, the fl uorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-abs), the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the hemagglutination treponemal test for syphilis (HATTS).",

However, this will increase with the duration of the chancre during primary infection to approximately 70 % for both the treponemal and nontreponemal tests by the time the chancre heals.

The CSF-FTA-abs test appears more sensitive for screening CSF but is less specifi c than the CSF-VDRL test in distinguishing currently active neurosyphilis from past syphilis. These fi ndings imply that clinical judgment remains the sine qua non for establishing the diagnosis of active neurosyphilis. Most other tests are both insensitive and nonspecifi c and must be interpreted in relation to other test results and the clinical assessment. Furthermore, one cannot use the more sensitive treponemal antibody tests with CSF to diagnose neurosyphilis as these antibodies cross the blood-brain barrier and are therefore likely to be present in the CSF of all patients who have positive serum treponemal tests for syphilis. Thus, a positive CSF treponemal test does not provide any additional information to that obtained by testing serum alone.

Lyme disease was fi rst recognized in the United States in the early 1970s when Dr. Allen Steere at Yale University investigated an outbreak of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in the small towns of Lyme, Old Lyme, and East Haddam, Connecticut. In the initial report, they identifi ed and ascertained 39 children and 12 adults who presented with a classic, characteristic, remitting, relapsing oligoarticular arthritis with onset in the summer or early fall. All of these patients lived in rural areas and half of the patients lived on two adjacent country roads. In addition, 13 of these patients had noted an unusual skin lesion an average of 4 months before the onset of the arthritis [ 417 ] . Subsequent prospective studies then defi ned neurologic abnormalities such as Bell's palsy, sensory radiculoneuritis, lymphocytic meningitis, and cardiac conduction abnormalities also associated with Lyme disease. These studies showed that at least a quarter of the patients remembered a tick bite at the site of the initial skin lesion, and based on examination of the actual tick from one of these patients, the vector was identifi ed as Ixodes scapularis [ 418 -420 ] . The agent of Lyme disease was fi nally isolated by Dr. Willy Burgdorfer from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton, Montana, when he was searching for evidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in ticks isolated from New York State. No rickettsia were found; however, spirochetes were seen in stains of the insect's digestive tract [ 421 , 422 ] .",

Approximately 50 % of untreated patients progress to disseminated disease. During the fi rst stage, the earliest manifestations of Lyme disease occur at the site of the tick bite beginning as a red macule or papule that may expand to an area 10-15 cm with red outer borders and partial central clearing-the so-called \"bull's eye\" skin rash. The lesion develops as early as 3 days and as late as 30 days following the initial bite and generally lasts 3-4 weeks. It is most commonly located on the thigh or groin and develops in approximately 80 % of patients [ 419 , 423 , 424 ] . Following the entry of the spirochete into the patient via the tick bite, dissemination of the spirochete occurs during the development of this initial lesion, and while some patients may develop multiple secondary annular lesions that are similar to the primary site lesion, others may clear the infection without developing symptoms. All patients largely remain seropositive. In the second stage, the organism produces symptoms by direct invasion. Systemic symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, and malaise along with generalized lymphadenopathy, meningismus, encephalopathy, migratory musculoskeletal pain, splenomegaly, sore throat, and cough may develop in varying degrees during this early disseminated phase [ 423 , 424 ] . For the most part, the systemic manifestations as well the erythema chronicum migrans lesions themselves usually resolve without treatment in 3-4 weeks. Untreated, however, the Lyme disease spirochete becomes sequestered and persists in various tissues, particularly the CNS, joints, heart, and the skin.",

The most important rickettsiosis in the United States is Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which is an acute febrile illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii . As the name implies, the disease is seen in the Rocky Mountain States, such as Colorado and Wyoming, but also occurs in the inland parts of North Carolina, Virginia, and other Southeastern States. For RMSF, the incubation period between tick bite and onset of illness is 2-6 days. Fever, headache, rash, mental confusion, and myalgia are the predominant clinical features [ 469 -471 ] . The rash usually develops on the second or third day of illness, initially on the wrists and ankles followed by spread to the trunk within hours. In contrast with a viral exanthem, the RMSF rash can appear on the palms and soles. About 25 % of patients may have an encephalitis at presentation with lethargy, confusion, or delirium. This may deteriorate to seizures and coma. As a result of the variability of the vessels involved in the CNS, a wide range of clinical neurologic features are associated with RMSF, including seizures, deafness, facial diplegia, gaze palsies, nystagmus, ataxia, dysphasia, transverse myelitis, neurogenic bladder, hemiplegia, and paraplegia or quadriplegia.",

In adults and children, the recommended dose is doxycycline 100 mg per dose administered twice daily (orally or intravenously) for adults or 2.2 mg/kg body weight per dose administered twice daily (orally or intravenously) for children weighing less than 100 lbs (45.4 kg) [ 470 ] .

However, in 1997, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases revised its recommendations and identifi ed doxycycline as the drug of choice for treating presumed or confi rmed RMSF in children of any age, because of the effectiveness of this antimicrobial in reducing attributable morbidity and potential mortality.

Pathologic involvement of the brain is most often manifest by chalky, yellowish white, 1-2 mm nodules distributed diffusely throughout the cortical and subcortical gray matter of both the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The most frequently involved sites are the temporal, periventricular, and periaqueductal gray matter as well as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia. Histologically, the nodules are made up of microglia that stain strongly positive with PAS.

Management of the disease includes medical control of seizures. Although some authors have advocated the use of antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., interferon, ribavirin, and Isoprinosine) to slow the progression of the disease and improve life expectancy in patients, the results are confl icting-the condition continues to show relentless progression.

Thus, although blinded studies are needed to confi rm this observation and treatment guidelines do not rec-ommend its use, cidofovir should be strongly considered in the empiric treatment of PML, keeping in mind the risk of renal toxicity associated with its use. Initial reports of success with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) have not been supported by a formal clinical trial [ 520 ] . ",

The T2-w image ( a ) illustrates cytogenic edema distributed not only within the anterior and mesial right temporal lobe but also within the frontotemporal association bundle and basifrontal cortex. It involves gray and white matter. There is less obvious change on the left. This pattern, in the right clinical context, is typical of HSV-1 cerebritis. It has a differential of tumoral gliomatosis, but the latter typically has a more prolonged presenting clinical course. The post-contrast T1-w image ( b ) demonstrates pial and perivascular enhancement. HSV-1 is an angiophilic organism which can produce a necrotizing intrinsic angiitis which can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, although not in this case although the mechanism by which the virus does this remains unknown. About two-thirds of cases of HSV encephalitis in adults and older children occur in patients who have antibody to the virus at the time of infection. Many of these patients have a history of cold sores dating back 20-30 years.",
