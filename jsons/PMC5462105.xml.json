However, in vitro studies have suggested that respiratory viruses are capable of independently inducing type 2 inflammation, by causing a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), from the airway epithelium [7], [8]. In this innate immune pathway, TSLP causes release of type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, from T-cells through activation of dendritic cells [9] and by direct action on innate lymphoid cells (ILC) [10]. TSLP is increased in patients with asthma, compared to controls [11] and anti-TSLP antibodies have been shown to reduce airway inflammation in response to an allergen provocation test [12]. Epithelial cells from asthmatics seem to be particular prone to TSLP release following exposure to viral infection in vitro\n[8] but whether TSLP is induced in asthmatics during viral infection in vivo and stimulates type 2 inflammation is unknown.",

Because patients were examined during an exacerbation, they were not asked to withhold beta-2-agonists prior to spirometry, but the time since the last dose of reliever was taken was recorded. Induced sputum was processed as described by Pavord et al. [23]: In brief, after inhalation of 1 mg terbutaline, sputum was induced by inhalation of hypertonic saline in increasing concentrations (3%, 4%, and 5%) for 5 min each (total duration 15 min). Sputum plugs were selected and processed, cytospins were prepared, and a differential cell count of 400 non-squamous cells was completed. The hospital clinical laboratory completed a full white blood cell differential count and measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), total IgE and specific IgE to common allergens (grasses, house dust mite, birch, mugwort, dog, cat, horse, Cladosporium herbarum and Alternaria tenuis). Atopy was defined as the presence of specific IgE (>0.35 IU/ml) to one or more of these allergens. Asthma control was assessed with the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) [24].",

In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that participants with high sputum TSLP had lower sputum eosinophils, lower FeNO and higher %FEV1 at exacerbation than participants with low sputum TSLP suggesting that TSLP does not promote type 2 inflammation in the airways during virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. It is possible that the timing of sample collection and changes in post-translational modification of the TSLP mRNA could have impacted on the final amount of TSLP protein being produced, although, previous studies have found good concordance between TSLP gene expression and protein concentration [11], [31]. An inhibitory effect of corticosteroids cannot be ruled out, but it would not explain the difference between the virus-positive and virus-negative group.",

Denlinger and colleagues sampled asthma patients with symptoms of a cold, and found that patients who went on to develop a clinical exacerbation were characterized by higher sputum neutrophils, whereas an association with eosinophils or FeNO was not observed. However, it should be noted that the study was not aimed at describing the severity of the exacerbations, and the potential association with sputum inflammatory phenotype [39]. Wark and colleagues have found that degranulation of both neutrophils and eosinophils was associated with a longer time in hospital for patients admitted with virus-induced acute asthma [40]. In the present study, sputum neutrophil count, though elevated in virus-positive exacerbations compared to non-viral exacerbations, did not correlate with FEV1.",
