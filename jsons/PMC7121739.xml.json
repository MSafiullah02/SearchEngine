From submicroscopic infectious particles (viruses), small unicellular cells (bacteria and yeasts) to multinucleate and multicellular organisms (filamentous fungi, protozoa, and helminths), microorganisms have found their way into virtually every environmental niche, and show little restrain in making their presence felt. While a majority of microorganisms are free-living and involved in the degradation of plant debris and other organic materials, others lead a symbiotic, mutually beneficial life within their hosts. In addition, some microorganisms have the capacity to take advantage of temporary weaknesses in animal and human hosts, causing notable morbidity and mortality. Because clinical manifestations in animals and humans resulting from infections with various microorganisms are often nonspecific (e.g., general malaise and fever), it is necessary to apply laboratory diagnostic means to identify the culprit organisms for treatment and prevention purposes.",

Considering the close similarity among microorganisms causing diseases in humans and animals, many laboratory techniques that have been developed for the identification and detection, subtyping and phylogenetic analysis, virulence determination, and drug resistance assessment of human pathogens, have been thus readily adopted for the investigation of animal pathogens, or vice versa. Furthermore, apart from zoonotic pathogens that occur in both human and animals, animals of different classes and categories often have unique pathogens of their own. Therefore, veterinary diagnostic microbiology faces even greater challenges than its medical counterpart in achieving accurate, sensitive, and rapid identification and detection of pathogenic microorganisms in animals.",

            "text": "Morphological characterization is based on the premise that various classes of microorganisms often show distinct morphological features (e.g., size, shape, internal and external components, colony morphology) which allow their initial identification upon macroscopic and microscopic examination. Application of light microscopy or transmission and scanning electron microscopy (EM) together with stains/dyes helps reveal additional morphological details. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gram, Giemsa, crystal violet stains are common stains used to enhance the contrast of microbes to their background. Additionally, Gimenez\u2019 and Pinkerton\u2019s stains are useful for detection of rickettsial organisms in tissue sections; Ziehl-Nielsen, Kinyoun, or auramine O stains for initial detection of mycobacteria; KOH, lactophenol cotton blue, India ink, and Southgate\u2019s mucicarmine stains for detection of fungi; periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver (GMS), Fontana-Masson, Gridley\u2019s, and H&E stains for detection of mycotic elements in tissue biopsies. In general, morphological characterization is rapid and inexpensive, but has relatively low sensitivity and specificity, and its result interpretation is somewhat subjective. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of microscopic detection of pathogenic microorganisms (especially viruses), fluorescently labeled antibodies may be utilized. Application of highly sensitive and specific fluorescent sensor molecules in electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, or time-lapse microscopy has further enhanced morphological characterization of microorganisms. Besides unraveling paradigms of pathogen entry and pinpointing the exact intracellular location, these new techniques permit direct monitoring of the intracellular lifestyle of microbial pathogens and yield insights into the underlying mechanisms of their pathogenicity [2, 3]. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques offer a powerful platform for analyzing the structure, properties and functions of microbial pathogens as well as the localization, mechanics, and interactions of the individual cell wall constituents, contributing to the elucidation of the molecular bases of cell adhesion (nanoadhesome) and mechanosensing (nanosensosome) [4, 5].",

            "text": "Biochemical characterization focuses on the metabolic or enzymatic products of microorganisms, including distinct patterns of carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, fat metabolisms and production of particular enzymes. Biochemical tests are often conducted to distinguish between aerobic and anaerobic breakdown of carbohydrates, to show carbohydrates that can be attacked, to detect specific breakdown products of carbohydrates (e.g., the formation of acids, alcohols and gases when grown in selective liquid or solid media), to determine the ability of carbohydrates to utilize substrates such as citrate and malonate, to examine the metabolism of protein and amino acids (e.g., gelatine liquefaction, indole production, amino acid decarboxylase test, and phenylamine deaminase test) as well as of fats (e.g., hydrolysis of tribtyrin), and detect production of enzymes (e.g., catalase test, oxidase test, urease test, ONPG test, and nitrate reduction). Assessment of fungal primary metabolites such as ubiquinones (coenzyme Q) is useful for the taxonomy of black yeasts and filamentous fungi, whereas examination of fungal secondary metabolites (e.g., steroids, terpenes, alkaloids, cyclopeptides, and coumarins) by chromatographic techniques provides another means for fungal identification. A recent approach for biochemical characterization of microorganisms centers on the characteristic outer surface charges of microbes that contribute to their distinct migration under a direct-current electric field such as capillary electrophoresis (CE), leading to rapid and efficient separation, identification, quantitation, and characterization of intact microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, and fungi) [6]. Another useful technique for biochemical characterization of microbes is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), which has been shown to be useful for specific identification of Francisella and other microbial pathogens [7].",

            "text": "Serological characterization on the basis of specific reactions between host antibodies and microbial antigens (usually protein or carbohydrate) provides highly sensitive, specific, and rapid identification of microorganisms. Detection of rising levels of specific IgA, IgM, and IgG antibody titers or seroconversion in blood, urine, and fecal materials offers indirect evidence for causal relationships between diseases and microbial pathogens [8]. An interesting development in the serological characterization of disease-causing microorganisms is the use of chemically synthesized peptides. Generated by chemical approaches, these peptides are composed of two or more amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. By mimicking naturally occurring peptides or segments of proteins, these peptides serve as synthetic antigens in peptide microarrays as potential diagnostic tools in high-throughput immunoassays [9]. Other new developments in serological characterization of microorganisms include biosensors and nanotechnology (nanoarrays and nanochips). Biosensors involve the use of a microbe-specific antibody and a transducer (e.g., electrochemistry, reflectometry, interferometry, resonance, and fluorimetry) to convert a biological interaction into a measurable signal. In the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) for brucellosis, submicron polystyrene particles are coated with antigen and placed in a 96-well vacuum plate. After addition of fluorescent conjugate followed by vacuum filtration to remove unbound conjugate, the total particle-bound fluorescence is measured by front surface fluorimetry. Nanotechnology (nanoarrays and nanochips) offers small scale platforms to identify an array of infectious agents or serotypes on a single chip.",

            "text": "Biological characterization focuses on the issues related to the host susceptibility, transmission patterns, pathological effect(s), and geographical origin of microbial pathogens, which are critical in helping achieve correct diagnosis of microbial infections in cases where other relevant data are scarce [10]. In vitro isolation and propagation on laboratory media and cell lines offers a valuable tool for identification and diagnosis of microbial infections. The size, color, shape and form of colonies formed by microorganisms on nutritional agar and other selective media are diagnostically informative. In case of viral pathogens, the formation of a region of dead cells resulting from viral growth (called a \u201cplaque\u201d) suggests their cytopathogenic effects (CPE). Parasitic protozoa may also be cultivated as a means of identification [11]. However, because not all microorganisms will grow in laboratory media and cell lines, embryonated eggs, insect vector, and laboratory animals (e.g., rodents) may be utilized. For example, Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent for Chagas disease, is grown in the guts of its vector triatomine bug for confirmation and diagnosis. The availability of cultured isolate/strain permits further antigenic studies, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and genetic studies. Despite their relatively high expense and length of time required, in vitro and in vivo techniques have contributed to the studies of microbial taxonomy, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment response. A recent development in the use of in vivo techniques for microbial characterization relates to the in vivo bioluminescence imaging or biophotonic imaging (BPI). Based on genetically engineered bioluminescent/fluorescent microorganisms, this technique enhances the study of microbial infections and host immune responses [12]. Application of genetically engineered mice with luciferase reporters for specific microbial or host genes helps overcome the limitations of in vivo bioluminescence imaging for assessment of microbial replication, activation of key genes in host immunity, and response to tissue damage in vivo [13].",

This often involves (1) disruption of cell walls, (2) denaturation of nucleoprotein complexes, (3) inactivation of endogenous DNase/RNAse, and (4) removal of contaminating proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenolic pigments, and other compounds [14]. While enzymatic digestion (e.g., using lyticase, zymolase, chitinase, gluculase, and/or proteinase K) and occasionally acid and alkali treatments may be effective for breaking up bacterial and yeast cells, mechanical grinding, sonication or bead-beating is often necessary to disrupt the mycelial and helminth cell walls. Following extraction with organic solvents (e.g., phenol/chloroform) and detergents (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS; hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB; and N-lauroylsarcosine), which denatures cytosolic proteins and lipid membranes and inactivates endogenous DNase/RNAse, nucleic acids of high purity are obtained after precipitation with ethanol or isopropanol. The recent development of various easy-to-use commercial kits has negated the need to use hazardous organic solvents in the isolation of microbial DNA/RNA.

A more recent development in the DNA hybridization-based approach is DNA microarray, in which high-density oligonucleotide probes (or segments of DNA) are immobilized on a solid surface, and used to hybridize (catch) any complementary sequences (labeled with fluorescent nucleotides) in a test sample. Subsequent detection and quantification of fluorescence signal permits identification and determination of the relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in a sample [16]. Although these nonamplified procedures have adequate specificity, they are relatively insensitive, often requiring large quantity of starting materials for reliable detection. Nonetheless, some of these nonamplified techniques remain valuable for comparison of microbial genomes and for identification of species- and virulence-specific gene regions. For example, dot blot hybridization was employed for screening genomic DNA libraries of Dichelobacter nodosus strains causing virulent and benign footrot, and several virulent- and benign-specific gene regions for subsequent differentiation of virulent and avirulent D. nodosus strains were identified as a result [17, 18]. This approach was also applied for identification of novel virulence-specific gene regions in zoonotic bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and novel species-specific gene in animal bacterial pathogen Listeria ivanovii [19, 20].",

Since then, PCR and its variants (e.g., nested PCR, multiplex PCR, real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR (DOP-PCR), sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA), and rolling circle amplification (RCA)) have been widely applied in research and clinical laboratories for identification and phylogenetic analysis of microorganisms [21\u201324]. Apart from PCR, other nucleic acid amplification procedures include nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification (NASBA), ligase chain reaction (LCR), strand displacement amplification, Q-\u03b2 replicase-mediated amplification, linear-linked amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), etc.",

Among the various PAGE-based procedures, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) are widely applied. SSCP is capable of detecting single nucleotide variations, and in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE), SSCP-CE provides an automated system for rapid separation of nucleic acid products.

The availability of laboratory techniques to accurately assess the pathogenic potential of these microorganisms is vitally important to their control and prevention. For example, gram-negative bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus harbors strains that cause virulent, intermediate or benign footrot in sheep. As virulent and some intermediate footrot induces lameness and severe pain in affected sheep, leading to ill-thrift and reduced weight gain, it is necessary to apply control measures to stem the economic losses. On the other hand, benign footrot causes minimal harm to affected sheep and has the tendency to self-cure, it is unnecessary and indeed wasteful to treat benign footrot. Traditionally, the virulence of D. nodosus strains is determined by elastase test and gelatin gel test, which may take up to 4 weeks to complete, and often demonstrate notable variability. After comparative analysis of recombinant DNA libraries from D. nodosus virulent and benign strains, a panel of virulent- and benign-specific genes was identified. Use of gene probes and primers derived from these genes facilitate rapid and sensitive determination of D. nodosus virulence [17, 18].",

While some L. monocytogenes strains are highly pathogenic and sometimes deadly, others are relatively avirulent and cause little harm in the host. The current laboratory techniques for assessing the virulence of L. monocytogenes strains include the mouse virulence assay and in vitro cell assays. While the mouse virulence assay is capable of providing an in vivo measurement of all virulent determinants, its high expense limits its application. Representing a low-cost alternative to the mouse virulence assay for assessing L. monocytogenes virulence, in vitro cell culture techniques measure the ability of L. monocytogenes to cause cytopathogenic effects in the enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2, to form plaques in the human adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29, or to cause death in chicken embryos. Several other cell lines (e.g., hepatocyte Hep-G2, macrophage-like J774, epithelial Henle 407 and L2) are also useful for studies on L. monocytogenes ability to adhere, invade, escape from vacuoles, grow intracellularly and spread to neighboring cells. However, these techniques are time-consuming, and occasionally variable. Following recent identification of novel virulence-specific genes (e.g., inlJ), the virulence of L. monocytogenes strains can be rapidly and specifically determined by PCR [19, 29].",

As drug are often used in animals (e.g., such as cows, pigs, chickens, fish, etc.) that provide an important source of human food, microorganisms exposed to these drugs can develop antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer events (e.g., conjugation, transduction, or transformation) and point mutations [30]. The resistant bacteria in animals due to antibiotic exposure can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of meat, from close or direct contact with animals, or through the environment. For example, use of fluoroquinolone in poultry production has been linked to the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistant campylobacter infections in humans. Some bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, gonococci, streptococci, salmonella, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) have developed multidrug resistance [31]. For example, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are resistant to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs as well. Identification of MRSA has implications not only for treatment of infected animals, but for potential zoonotic transmission [32, 33]. While application of in vitro culture technique facilitates determination of MIC (medium inhibition concentration) of the strains, detection of specific gene mutations provides an alternative approach for assessment of antimicrobial drug resistance in microorganisms such as B. hyodysenteriae [34].",
