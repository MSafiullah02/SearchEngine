This finding was also reported in previous Chinese studies [8,13,14] as well as in an earlier study on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [15]. It is well known that elevated LDH levels are suggestive of haematological malignancy and acute lung injury, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV patients [16]. LDH levels might reflect tissue necrosis related to immune hyperactivity and thus relate to poor clinical outcome [17]. LDH levels may be a useful and easy to test parameter in order to identify patients at risk for severe respiratory failure.",
