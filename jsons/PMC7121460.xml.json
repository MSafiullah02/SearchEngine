Measurement of immunoglobulin E (IgE) is useful in a patient with recurrent bacterial infections and dermatitis because if the level is greater than 2000 IU/mL, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is suspected. Measurement of IgG antibody titers to tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B , and protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines is used to assess response to protein antigens, which is critical to assess the integrity of humoral immunity. The mitogen lymphocyte proliferation test is used to evaluate the integrity of T-cell responses to plant mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PMW), which are powerful stimulants of T cells.\n",

Two typhoid vaccines are licensed for use in the USA: a Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine for parenteral use and an oral live-attenuated vaccine. Neither one provides complete protection. The vaccine efficacy appears high in US travelers [5]. However, the vaccines are not nearly as effective in populations where typhoid is endemic [6]. Efficacy at 1 and 2 years was 35% and 58% for the oral vaccine and 69% and 59% for the intramuscular vaccine, respectively [7]. Immunization is recommended only for specific populations, including travelers to areas where risk of exposure is recognized; people with intimate exposure to a documented typhoid fever carrier, as occurs with prolonged household contact; laboratory workers having frequent contact with Salmonella serovar Typhi; and people living outside the USA in areas with endemic typhoid infection [1, 2].\nKey Points/PearlsNontyphoidal Salmonella infections are far more common in the USA than typhoid fever.Populations at particular risk for invasive disease include infants <3 months of age and people with chronic gastrointestinal disease, cancer, hemoglobinopathies, HIV infection, or other immunosuppressive illnesses or therapies.The principal reservoirs for nontyphoidal Salmonella include birds, mammals, reptiles, small turtles, and amphibians; a thorough review of exposure history may reveal clues that can help to narrow the differential diagnosis.Nontyphoidal Salmonella cause asymptomatic gastrointestinal tract carriage, gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and focal infections including meningitis, brain abscess, and osteomyelitis.Superinfection of a subdural empyema should be considered in a child with chronic subdural hematoma and the clinical triad of prolonged fever, gastroenteritis, and neurological abnormalities.\nSalmonella Sandiego, a rare nontyphoidal Salmonella serotype, has been implicated in a number of US outbreaks linked to contact with small turtles.Antibiotics usually are not indicated for patients with either asymptomatic nontyphoidal Salmonella infection or uncomplicated gastroenteritis; they are usually recommended only in certain populations at high risk for invasive disease.Typhoid vaccines are recommended and considered highly effective in travelers to countries where typhoid is endemic.The live typhoid vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients.Prolonged nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia may be due to an aortic mycotic aneurism, a life-threatening condition that requires vascular surgery interventions.\n",
