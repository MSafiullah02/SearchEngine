The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.",

All critically ill patients were admitted to either a high-dependency unit or ICU; patients requiring non-invasive respiratory support were admitted to high-dependency units while those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were admitted to ICUs. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. Testing was performed by the New York State Department of Health from March 2 to March 10, 2020, after which testing capacity was developed by clinical microbiology laboratories at NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals. We identified critically ill patients with COVID-19 through daily review of hospital admission logs in the electronic medical record.

We also recorded concentrations of plasma-based and serum-based biomarkers drawn within 72 h of hospital admission, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We prospectively collected data on management interventions delivered during hospitalisation including initiation and duration of mechanical ventilation, administration of advanced therapies for acute respiratory failure (neuromuscular blocking agents, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, prone-positioning ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), vasopressor agents, renal replacement therapy, antibacterial agents, antiviral",

The sudden surge of critically ill patients admitted with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome initially outpaced our capacity to provide prone-positioning ventilation, which was only performed in three of eight ICUs at our institution at the start of the outbreak. We have since expanded our capacity for prone-positioning ventilation by deploying dedicated proning teams to all ICUs, including non-traditional ICU locations. The low volume of ECMO used during the study period is primarily a reflection of the low number of patients within our hospital system meeting criteria after initiating other therapies, such as lung-protective IMV and pronepositioning ventilation. As an ECMO referral center for regional hospitals, we received a moderate-to-high volume of ECMO referrals during that period, the majority of which were optimised with conventional management strategies and did not ultimately meet criteria for ECMO or were excluded on the basis of low probability of benefit.",

Higher concentrations of IL-6, which have been observed among patients with COVID-19 with more severe clinical illness, 16, 17 were also associated with in-hospital mortality. Although the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 remains to be completely understood, emerging data suggest that organ dysfunction and poor outcomes could be mediated by high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and dysregulated coagulation and thrombosis. 12, 13, 18 Continued investigation of these pathological processes and the utility of their biomarkers is needed, given increasing reports of corticosteroid use and ongoing clinical trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists among critically ill patients with COVID-19 (eg, NCT04315298 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov) as well as rapidly evolving guidelines 19 for anticoagulant use in this population. Consistent with data from China, 3 and Italy, 8 hypertension was associated with poor in-hospital survival. Given the globally high burden of hypertension and emerging understanding of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2, 20 further investigations are needed to better define a relation-if any-between hypertension, exposure to renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists, and severe COVID-19.",

A randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical trial from China reported no significant differences in time to clinical improvement or 28-day mortality among patients with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to hospital receiving remdesivir. 25 However, this trial was underpowered, given a lack of patients eligible for enrolment. More recently, based on preliminary, unpublished data from an adaptive, placebo-controlled clinical trial sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NCT04280705 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov) and an open-label trial sponsored by Gilead Sciences (NCT04292899 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov), the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for remdesivir among severely ill inpatients with COVID-19. 26 For hydroxychloroquine, emerging observational data from the USA have not reported signals of clinical benefit for use of this agent among inpatients with COVID-19. 27 To better evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in this setting, investigators at Oxford University (Oxford, UK) and the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute have launched randomised clinical trials among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the UK (ISRCTN50189673 registered with ISRCTN) and the USA (NCT04332991 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Second, we prospectively identified patients and collected data. Thus, our findings reflect the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in New York City, currently the epicentre of the pandemic. Third, we collected data using a globally harmonised, WHO-endorsed case record form. Fourth, we augmented collection of standard clinical and laboratory data with clinically and pathologically relevant biomarkers, concentrations of which were available for nearly all patients. Lastly, given the prospective nature of our study, our analyses were done with near-complete data, with in-hospital outcomes known for all included patients through This study has several limitations. First, our study took place in two hospitals in northern Manhattan, potentially limiting generalisability to hospital settings elsewhere in New York City, especially in terms of the demographic characteristics of the patient population. Specifically, our cohort included a high proportion of Hispanic or Latino and black or African American patients who are known to have higher prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities that may make social distancing and access to care more difficult. 29 Studies among more racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings. Despite these limitations, our sites included both a large quaternary referral hospital and a smaller, community-based hospital, thereby increasing generalisability to other clinical settings. Second, our analyses incorporated outcome data collected through April 28, 2020. As vital status is not yet known for patients who remained hospitalised after this date, the 39% mortality reported here represents the minimum in-hospital case fatality rate for our cohort. Third, patients presented to the hospital at varying times in their illness course, which could have affected their clinical course and outcomes. To mitigate the potential effect of this variance on our analyses, we included time from symptom onset to hospital presentation as a covariable in our regression models. Fourth, of available biomarkers, we included IL-6 and D-dimer in our multivariable models because of the pathophysiological and treatment implications. We did not analyse serial concentrations of these and other biomarkers, which might fluctuate considerably over the course of the illness.",
