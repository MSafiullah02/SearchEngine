Currently, all described human types are dispatched into 54 types representing seven species (A-G), which belong to the genus Mastadenovirus in the Adenoviridae family [1] . They are commonly responsible for a wide range of respiratory, gastrointestinal or ophthalmic illnesses. All HAdV types are excreted in very high numbers in faeces of infected people, regardless of the initial infection site [2] . Some HAdVs can establish long-lasting but indiscernible infections. As a result, the infected person sheds viruses unknowingly, and can then serve as a source of infection for other individuals [3] . After recovery from illness, HAdVs, especially the members of the HAdV-C species, may maintain latent persistent infections in the tonsils, the adenoids and other lymphoid tissues [4] . Some types (e.g., 1, 2, 3 and 5) are continuously present in the population. Most people have thus been exposed (primary infection) and at least 90% of the human population are positive to one or more HAdV antibodies [5, 6] , even though no acute disease has been declared. On the contrary, HAdV infections (primary infections or reactivation of latent viruses) in immunocompromised people tend to become invasive, and the fatality rate may be as high as 50% [7] . After haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the immune system is weakened and many viruses are identified as a major risk for patients [8, 9] .

The developed technique is powerful and allows detection of small amounts of HAdV particles in stool samples. To our knowledge this is the first description of iPCR for HAdVs.
