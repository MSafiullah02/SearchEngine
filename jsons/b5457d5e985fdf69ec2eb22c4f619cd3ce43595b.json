In this paper, we address an extractive summarization (i.e., headline extraction) task for such questions as a case study and consider how to alleviate the problem by using question-answer pairs, instead of missing-headline pairs. To this end, we propose a framework to examine how to use such unlabeled paired data from the viewpoint of training methods.

Chiebukuro [31] , the first sentence of a question tends to be displayed as a headline (or list item) because of a restriction on the display area. Note that, to reduce the burden on users who post questions, many CQA sites do not provide an input field for headlines in the submission form. The most important sentence in a question, however, should be displayed instead of the first sentence, because sometimes the first sentence does not provide enough information, as shown in Fig. 1 (translated to English).",

Many QA pairs on CQA sites can be easily obtained without annotation costs and are expected to be useful because, in general, each answer should be closely related to the most important sentence in the question. In fact, the answer in Fig. 1 includes keywords such as \"initial setup\" and \"Wi-Fi\" in the main question sentence. Our framework can be regarded as a semi-supervised approach with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled (paired) data. The main difference from classical semi-supervised settings is that unlabeled data has a paired structure. This allows us to formulate our problem as a multi-task problem of sentence extraction and answer generation. One of the difficulties of this formulation is \"data imbalance\", meaning that there is a small amount of data for sentence extraction and a large amount for answer generation. Therefore, we focus on this data imbalance problem and investigate how to use the unlabeled paired data from the viewpoint of training methods.",

Our experimental results show that (a) multi-task training performs the best but does not work well without an appropriate sampling method to reduce the data imbalance, and that (b) the multi-task training method is further enhanced with data augmentation based on distant supervision, which can simply solve the data imbalance problem. Our data and code will be publicly available [14] . Our framework consists of two models (Fig. 2) ; the sentence extraction model (SEM) based on a sequence labeling structure, and the answer generation model (AGM) based on a sequence-to-sequence structure. SEM directly solves our task, whereas AGM provides auxiliary information via attention weights. SEM first encodes a question with sentences (s 1 , . . . , s m ) into sentence vectors (h 1 , . . . , h m ) via a hierarchical encoder based on two LSTM units for words and sentences. Then, for each sentence s i , the model calculates the extraction probability p(s i ), which represents the importance score of s i , by applying a binary softmax function with a linear transformation to h i . In the training phase, we use the cross entropy loss L ext based on p(s i ) and the true label, similarly to classification tasks. We use SEM to define the importance score of s i as f ext (s i ) = p(s i ), which is used for the evaluation phase, together with a score obtained by AGM as described below.",

The model uses these vectors to generate an answer (word sequence) by using an ordinary sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism. We do not use a hierarchical decoder, because the main purpose of this study is not to improve the performance of answer generation. In the training phase, we use the negative log likelihood loss L gen based on a predicted sequence and the correct sequence. In the evaluation phase, we calculate importance scores by using attention weights \u03b1 j (i), each of which represents the alignment level with respect to s i at the j-th step in generation. Specifically, we define the importance score of s i obtained by AGM as the average of the attention weights for s i , i.e., f gen (s i ) = 1 k k j=1 \u03b1 j (i). In our framework, we can thus simultaneously train two models in a multitask setting (SEM and AGM are the respective main and auxiliary models) and combine their importance scores to estimate the most important sentence. We introduce two tuning parameters \u03bb and \u03ba for training and evaluation phases, respectively. The final loss function for the training phase is \u03bbL ext + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)L gen , and the score function for the evaluation phase is \u03baf ext (s i ) + (1 \u2212 \u03ba)f gen (s i ).",

Note that well-known metrics such as ROUGE and precision/recall were not appropriate, because our task was to find only one sentence as a (snippet) headline. We divided the labeled data Label into five sets (train:develop:test = 3:1:1) and performed five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the methods. Results: Table 1 lists the results. The three row groups from top to bottom correspond to unsupervised, semi-supervised, and distantly supervised settings. In the first group, Lead performed the best, whereas the other methods (TfIdf, SimEmb, and LexRank) did not work well. This indicates the difficulty of our task and confirms that we need supervision to develop practical models.",

This suggests that reducing the data imbalance is a key factor for our setting. MultiOver also worked well but did not reach the performance of MultiUnder. The reason seems to be that sampling the same data many times yields overfitting. Among other methods, Sep performed well because of an ensemble effect of Ext and Gen, whereas Gen by itself performed the worst because it did not use any labels. Pre unexpectedly performed worse than Ext did, although Shimizu et al. [27] reported that sentiment classifiers were more enhanced by pretraining with tweet-reply pairs than by language model pretraining. This implies that the performance depends on the task settings, so our framework can be useful for other tasks.",

Although distant supervision itself has positive effects as shown by the improvement for ExtDist, it has an extra bonus in that pseudo labels can simply solve the data imbalance. These results suggest that we have room to study the combinations of multi-task training and distant supervision for other NLP tasks. We also prepared a larger labeled dataset than Label. The experiments on this dataset showed similar tendencies. We will study how the data size of labeled data affects the performances in future work.",

In the multi-task field, there have been several studies on summarization tasks. Guo et al. [11] improved an abstractive summarization model by using multi-task training with entailment and question generation tasks. Their work used human-annotated data from SQuAD dataset for these auxiliary tasks, whose sizes were much smaller than that of the main task, so their setting was completely different from ours. Angelidis et al. [2] addressed summarization of opinions from Amazon reviews by using multi-task training with aspect extraction and sentiment prediction tasks. Their work is related to ours in that they targeted user-generated content, but their auxiliary tasks were basic subtasks of opinion summarization with explicit aspect or sentiment labels. This implies that their task's usefulness was clearer than that of our task, in which we only assume a paired structure without any explicit labels. The study most related to ours is the work by Isonuma et al. [17] , who proposed an extractive summarization method for news articles through multitask training with a document classification task. Their strategy was similar to ours in that they used categories originally attached to news articles without costly annotation, but in many cases, we cannot access such categories or useful meta-information for documents, like CQA sites.",
