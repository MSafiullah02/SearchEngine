They are infectious starting 2 days before the end of their (Gamma distributed) incubation period, at which point they develop symptoms (and become Infected). Infected (I): Nodes which are now symptomatic. More infectious than during the final Exposed period. When their (exponentially distributed) Infected period ends, they become Recovered. Recovered (R): Nodes who have recovered (or died). They are no longer infectious and cannot be infected. In addition to those groups, a node can also belong to additional groups: Tested Positive (TP): Nodes who tested positive for COVID-19. At each simulation step, a certain share of Infected nodes are tested and a certain share of all nodes are tested. Nodes which are Exposed or Infected test positive. They become Quarantined, and potentially their neighbors are as well. We do not model false positives. Quarantined (Q): Nodes which are in quarantine. They can neither infect nor get infected. Quarantine ends after a set period. Their disease progression continues irrespective of Quarantine. We take as many parameters for the model as we can find from real attributes of covid-19, and calibrate the total infection probability to produce the doubling time of 3.1 days observed in various regions. For more details about the model, see appendix below, and open source code. Simulation starts with a certain number of Infected and Exposed nodes, and simulates the progression, tracking the total number of nodes in each group for later analysis. The results of a single simulation are plotted in the figure here. In this example there are no quarantines at all, and the epidemic spreads exponentially. In the early days, the number of Exposed outnumbers the Infected. The epidemic spreads until herd immunity is reached, at which point it decays exponentially until it is eradicated. The eventual number of people who were infected is the final number of Recovered, about 60%.",

This definition is very closely related to R 0 . The only difference is the uniform selection of the initial node, which is crucial as we shall see. r is nearly proportional to the mean degree times the probability of infection.

Recall our definition of r as the expected number of individuals infected by a single random person if that person is infectious and all others are Susceptible. This is a good approximation for the first step of infection. But after the first step of infection, individuals with larger degrees are more likely to have been infected, since they are more likely to have interacted with an infectious individual. This means after the first step, the degree distribution of the infectious is not the same as the population distribution -it skews higher. Those higher degree individuals will then infect (in expectation) more than r individuals, and so after the first step, R will be greater than r. An extreme (and unrealistic) case of this is a network with one central node and N-1 other nodes which are only connected to the central node. Let's take infection with probability 1 for simplicity. In this case r \u2248 2, but the expected number of individuals infected in 2 steps is N-1, all other nodes, and much more than r 2 , which is the expected in two steps if R = r. More precisely, if the degree, D, in the population is distributed by P(d) = P 0 (d), then irrespective of the degree distribution of the infectious nodes in the first generation, in the second generation it will be P 1 (d) = C \u00b7 P 0 (d) \u00b7 d, by Bayes' theorem, because a node with degree d is d times more likely to be connected to an infectious node than a node with degree 1 is. 3 Since these probabilities must sum up",
