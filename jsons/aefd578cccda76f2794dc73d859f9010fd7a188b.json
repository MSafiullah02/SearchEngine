These families are characterised by at least one parent or child who was born in the mainland and who emigrated into Hong Kong for reasons of family reunion. The length of resettlement was less than seven years during the period of research. 1 This chapter draws on my extensive review of literature about the migrant familiesranging from governmental reports, research by the non-governmental organisations, journal articles to Master's and PhD dissertations-from the early 1980s to mid-2000s. My research objectives are to unfold how these families are conceptualised, what units of analysis have been used and what research methods have been deployed.",

            "text": "I will make three arguments in this chapter. Firstly, I will suggest a shift of thinking about how migrant families have been understood over the past three decades. The dominant social adjustment agenda and the human capital-and information-de fi cit models in the 1980s and early 1990s have been under challenge by three emerging perspectives in the late 1990s. They are rights-based citizenship, gender and empowerment and social capital building. Secondly, I will show that the unit of analysis is also changing. On the one hand, the heterogeneous needs of different migrant groups, such as children, teenagers and married female migrants, are more speci fi cally targeted. On the other, family, as an intact and harmonious entity, has been questioned by the rising interest in the power dynamics within families between gender and across generations. Research has become more area-speci fi c and now pays more attention to the in fl uence of locality. Thirdly, I will illustrate with examples that research methodology in investigating migrant families has become more diverse and complex. In challenging the in fl uential positivistic and quantitative research, an increasing amount of research has been conducted in terms of ethnography, participatory action research, longitudinal study and discourse analysis. New qualitative research methods, such as drawing, diary taking, \"photovoice\" and workshops, have been attempted to engage the migrants and to explore the multiple realities of their everyday lives in the host society. Triangulating quantitative and qualitative data and deploying different sampling methods to reach less-accessible migrants are also a few new trends.",

The increasing dissatisfaction with the government's assimilation policies, the rising discrimination against new arrivals and the politicalisation of the welfare and migrant issues have forced local academics and NGOs to re-examine the \"social adjustment\" agenda. The emergence of competing ontologies in the international academic world, such as social constructionism and postmodernism, in response to new social challenges in the 1960s and 1970s, has offered alternatives to research methodologies and methods. I will argue in this chapter that these changing perspectives have signi fi cant implications on policy making and service delivery. While some NGOs take a more political stance to strive for migrants' full citizenship, the government has initiated social capital building programmes to foster community trust and networks. New strategies, such as mentor systems, are also introduced to reach previously marginalised migrants.",

This scheme was operated by the mainland authorities which governed the exit of mainlanders to Hong Kong for settlement (Task Force on Population Policy 2003 ) . This practice helped change the nature of Chinese migrants settling in Hong Kong. In 1981, 58% of immigrants were male and 42% female, but by 1991, the proportion of males dropped to 39% while the females rose to 61%.

This model places emphasis on incrementalism-social welfare should not affect the free economy and undermine individual work incentives. The colonial policy was to \"maintain the Chinese tradition\" which treated poverty as a personal matter which should be dealt with within the family system (Lee and Edwards 1998 , p. 27) . Underpinning this model also lies the value of economic rationality that welfare expenditures should fall within the con fi nes of economic growth.",

On other occasions, female migrants join their husbands before their children, so they leave children Source : Task force on population policy ( 2003 , p. 54) in the care of grandparents or other relatives in the mainland. This immigration policy has been accused of encouraging smuggling and corruption. Wang and Wong ( 1999 ) show their concern that many children and mainland wives, including some who were advanced in their pregnancy, risk their lives by placing themselves in the hands of \"snake-heads\" who smuggle them in for a high price. They are also in debt since they paid corrupt Chinese of fi cials in order to jump the queue. While a few NGOs started challenging the quota system and urging the Chinese government to reduce the years of separation on humanitarian grounds, migrant studies in Hong Kong in this period remained preoccupied with the adjustment agenda. Research by YMCA ( 1995 ) , Chan ( 1996 ) , the Boys' and Girls' Club Association of Hong Kong ( 1996 ) and Sham Shui Po District Council ( 1997 ) all placed emphasis on the adjustment problems in schools among young new arrivals. The study by YMCA, for instance, pointed out the dif fi culties of young migrants in fi nding schools, the big age gap between migrants and their fellow students, their poor performance in English subjects, and the psychological impact associated with the admission to lower forms. Research also looked into the problems faced by female migrants (e.g. Hong Kong Federation of Women's Centre 1999 ) . Emphasis was placed on their psychological adaptation and help-seeking patterns. The solutions, these studies recommend, were to enhance the existing adjustment programmes and to improve access to social services.",

Fifty-four percent of respondents thought migrants brought bad in fl uences to Hong Kong, and 55% believed that migrants were themselves to be blamed for their poverty. While this antimigrant sentiment can be linked to the rising Hong Kong indigenous identity resulted from the 1997 Question (Wang and Wong 1999 ) , Lee ( 1997 ) argues that this atmosphere is unfavourable to assimilation because this provides \"a social foundation for the exclusion of new immigrants\" when more and more Hong Kong people are concerned with the protection of their own territorial rights (p. 3, personal memo).

The Hong Kong government was worried about an in fl ux of a large number of mainland children to Hong Kong after the handover, so it passed the Right of Abode Ordinance to fi ll the \"loophole\" in June 1997. It sets three criteria: fi rst, only children born at the time that one of the parents became Hong Kong permanent residents enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong; second, children born out of wedlock do not have right of abodes; and third, children adopted out of Hong Kong do not enjoy the same right. Human rights activists and legal experts questioned the change of law and initiated legal action to seek clari fi cation in the courts.

In June 1999, NPCSC overturned the ruling of the Court of Final Appeal, deciding that, in cases where at least one of the parents of these mainland children had obtained permanent resident status by birth or residence at the time of birth of the children, they had to stay in China to wait for the one-way permit to Hong Kong.

SOCO ( 2003 ) and the Hong Kong Catholic Commission for Labour Affairs ( 1999 ) are the two most active NGOs in this aspect. In helping migrants to secure full social and political citizenship, they believe that legislation and raising migrants' awareness are paramount. They argue that social discrimination against migrants has prohibited the new arrivals from \"integrating\" into society and from seeking employment. The government should, therefore, create legislation to combat ethnic and gender discrimination. The government should also provide training programmes for migrants, so that they fully understand their rights to employment, participating in trade unions and collective negotiation.

In his case studies, three NGO groups adopted different approaches to advocating rights. The female-only neighbourhood group in Mongkok stressed migrants' rights (also known as \"ethnic citizenship\"), highlighting their status and needs as new arrivals in the host society and their demands for extra help. The against-familyviolence supporting group in Tsuen Wan, in contrast, focused on the migrants' Hong Kong citizen rights, suggesting that the migrants should enjoy the full rights and responsibilities granted by the Basic Law, as the Hong Kong born did. The mutual help community-currency group in Wanchai adopted a mixed approach, celebrating both migrants' ethnic status and Hong Kong citizenship. It considered these two identities as compatible and useful in maximising migrants' control over social and political resources. Acknowledging the signi fi cance of securing migrants' rights, Wong warns that, without fully understanding migrants' subjectivities and everyday interactions, the explicit promotion of rights can have negative impact on their livelihoods. Overemphasising migrants' citizen rights, for instance, can make migrants deprived of special rights that new arrivals can enjoy. Claiming dual rights maximises migrants' access to resources, but not all migrants feel comfortable with their mixed identities. Visible collective action may also risk damaging their community reputation and social networks (p. 177).",

The government is criticised for reinforcing women's roles as mothers and wives at home on the one hand and encouraging female migrants to participate in the labour market on the other. Ho ( 2006 ) argues that increasing female participation in the labour market does not automatically raise their social status at home and in society since martial hierarchy and male dominance in the labour market have not been tackled. Their increasing fi nancial contributions can only enhance marital tension and their workload at home. As a result, some migrant women may \"prefer[s] to return to the position of subordination if their husbands were able to take up the breadwinner role\" (p. 237).",

The gender issues around Chinese migrants in Hong Kong are far more complex. The role of masculinity, fatherhood and men's perceptions of childcare is important in understanding gender interactions within families. Choi ( 2001 ) shows that the rivalry between female migrants and their mothers-in-law can have negative impact on their well-being. Wong ( 2001 ) conducted a qualitative study, interviewing nine men who married women in the mainland. He fi nds that men felt useless if they had to stay home to look after their young children when their wives were away. Apart from gender relationships within families, research by the Boys' and Girls' Clubs Association touches upon the gendered living space in migrants' neighbourhoods ( 2004 ) . It highlights the fact that female migrants are more likely to suffer from sexual harassment because of multiple tenure and overcrowding. The solution to gender inequalities, the Hong Kong Integrated Family Services for New Arrivals Project ( 2005 ) and Chun ( 2005 ) propose, is empowerment through group participation. The Hong Kong Integrated Family Services for New Arrivals Project de fi nes empowerment as a \"process which helps individuals, groups and community foster a sense of con fi dence through participation\" (p. 4). Chun highlights three dimensions of empowerment: psychological empowerment, empowerment at group level and empowerment at the community level. The fi rst level of empowerment is related to self-con fi dence and a sense of control and competence. The second level stresses social network building and mutual support from the groups. The third dimension highlights the liaison between organisations and share of resources to support one another. Comparing female migrants' interpersonal skills and con fi dence in communication before and after group participation, Chun has portrayed a rather rosy picture about the positive correlation between public involvement and empowerment. She, however, plays down the downside of empowerment that may have negative impact on their lives.",

This report makes an alarming conclusion: weakening social networks will create strong reliance on the government in the long run (p. 99). Wong ( 2004 ) conducted a social capital survey and asked 1,502 households three questions: (1) How many relatives can lend you money? (2) How many relatives can introduce you to a job? (3) How many relatives can you trust? His research fi nds that poor groups have signi fi cantly lower social capital than non-poor groups. This study covers all poor people in a generic term, but the fi ndings have signi fi cant implications on poor mainland migrants in Hong Kong. In his 2001 policy address, the Chief Executive of the Special Administration Region of Hong Kong declared the setting up of a HK$300 million \"Community Investment and Inclusion Fund\". It aims to: promote community participation, mutual assistance, support and social inclusion provided through strengthened community network in the community. This will in turn help reinforce the sense of belonging in the community, enhance the social networks of individuals and families, broaden the support base available to assist them to resolve their problems and address common concerns. These community networks, strengthened relations, sense of belonging, and willingness to provide mutual aid form the foundation of social capital (Health, Welfare and Food Bureau 2002 , p. 4 ).",

Nevertheless, an increasing number of academics embrace the notion of social capital because it means more than social networks and touches on other social elements, such as trust, reciprocity and participation. Tang ( 2002 ) , for instance, examines the social capital formation of new-arrival students. He fi nds that social capital among migrant children is not evenly distributed, and the differences lie in \"their family and ethnic background\" (p. 147). Wong ( 2007 ) uses social capital to capture the fl uidity of migrants' associational lives. A female migrant in one of his case studies actively participates in various \"modern\" and \"traditional\" types of institutions: migrant group and clan association, church and temple, supermarket, and local fi sh and meat market. Her involvements in multiple institutions underscore the constant negotiation of time and space but are often constrained by poverty and social discrimination (pp. 133-137).",

The psychological adaptation and social needs of the new-arrival children and the middleaged women, for example, were researched separately. However, migrants have been deconstructed in a more complex manner since the late 1990s. Instead of targeting the \"usual suspects\", such as children, teenagers, young adults and housewives, Lam and Song ( 2002 ) deliberately focus on migrants who gained places at universities in Hong Kong. They explain that researchers tend to focus on the less-advantageous migrants and the successful ones are \"rarely researched and reported\" (p. 206). Ho ( 2006 ) sheds light on heterogeneity and complexity by breaking migrant couples into four types according to economics roles. They are traditional couples, dual-earner couples, working wives and non-productive husbands and families on welfare (p. 260). She examines how these different migrant couples make decisions in their everyday lives. Wong ( 2008 ) differentiates migrants by their identities and rural/urban backgrounds (see Table 37 .4 ). The fi rst group considered themselves as mainland Chinese with a strong rural identity. The second group has a strong Hong Table 37 .4 Discrimination amongst Chinese migrants 1. Chinese/rural identity mainly came from rural areas; skins are darker and accent stronger. Age gaps between them and their husbands and children are wide. Owing to their social backgrounds and physical characteristics, they encounter dif fi culties in hiding their migrant identity or switching their identity from one to the other 2. Hong Kong/urban identity may be as poor as the fi rst group, but their city and urban background before migration makes them believe that they are superior to the fi rst group. They have a stronger Hong Kong identity and thus accuse the fi rst group of bringing shame to migrants as a whole because of their reliance on social bene fi ts and lack of education 3. Hong Kong-Chinese/urban identity is mainly \"coping poor\". Families are more intact, husbands have stable jobs and they do not need to rely on social bene fi ts.

While migrants' general needs, such as psychological needs, school performance and social networking patterns, were the research focus in the early and mid-1990s, their speci fi c needs and concerns have received attention in the late 1990s. For instance, reports suggest that an increasing number of teenagers in Wong Tai Sin have used drugs. In order to examine if this trend has in fl uenced the teenage migrants, Wong Tai Sin Integrated Service for Young People ( 1999 ) conducted a special study on young new arrivals' attitudes towards drugs. This study suggests that while the majority of young migrants have not experienced drugs, they have very limited knowledge about them.",

The project leaders suggest that the aim of this method is \"not of counting things up but of drawing on the community's active lore, observations and stories, in both visual and oral terms\". They fi nd that it serves as \"a powerful medium of expression for marginal groups who are not capable of using authoritative means of presentation and expression such as writing\" (p. 145).

A study by the Tsuen Wan Caritas Community Centre shows that female migrants carry out many collective activities with their friends when their children are in school ( 1999 , p. 58) . They go shopping together, chat in restaurants and visit their mutual friends. When their children are at home, they contact their friends by phone or send letters to their mainland relations. They sometimes take their children to nearby playgrounds, markets and schools where they meet friends. These activities may not necessarily be \"functional\", but they are part of their collective lives. Lui and Wong ( 1998 ) therefore argue that collective action is not necessarily \"explosive and confrontational\". Migrants are involved in fl uid communities and engaged in informal friendship networks, temporary groups and occasional gatherings. Individuals are not tied to only one community but may have multiple and overlapping bonds. The understanding of migrants' daily interactions helps demonstrate that community and neighbourhood have different signi fi cance to different groups and the relations of cooperation change over time and space across migrants' life course.",

It fi rst selected 30 new immigrant families from the cases of its own organisation to form a focus group. It then surveyed 570 families and interviewed six to eight cases for deeper studies (p. 3). Choi ( 2001 ) combines the quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine how social capital is produced and reproduced within two clan associations in Hong Kong. There have been some changes of the sampling methods in the quantitative research over the past 25 years. Owing to the lack of a complete data set in the 1980s, researchers of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service had to distribute to every migrant a reservation card on which a number was written at the immigration control border. Those who got the number which matched with the computer's random sampling number would be selected for interview ( 1985 ) . The Home Of fi ce and the Statistical Department these days have complete data sets which enable quantitative researchers to deploy more sophisticated sampling methods to seek \"scienti fi c\" representation.",

Despite some differences among them, they tend to agree that it is a mistake to depict agency as either undersocialised or over-socialised. The former indicates the indeterminate nature of human actions and the capacity of individuals for willed and voluntary action which is not governed by social structure. It strongly believes that individuals are transformative agents who can challenge structural inequalities. The latter, on the contrary, argues that individual actions are predetermined and constrained by social structures. It portrays agents as passive recipients who are incapable of resisting the structures surrounding them.

In his words, we also need to look into their \"motivations, attitudes and [their] understanding of the structures within which they act\" (p. 12).",

In his research on new-arrival students' adaptation and school performance, Tang ( 2002 ) makes his theoretical background explicit: \"this study examines the interplay between structure (the culture, opportunity structure, and social networks of the host society) and agency (of the new arrival students) in the context of immigration adaptation\" (pp. 145-146, original brackets). In order to demonstrate that the process of migration is not simply personal adjustment problems, He ( 2006 ) examines the painstaking process of negotiation and migrants' subjectivities in crossborder marriage. To avoid idealising migrants' agency, researchers are aware of the role of structural forces that shape migrants' everyday practices. The Hong Kong Catholic Commission for Labour Affairs ( 1999 ) highlights the fact that the so-called new-arrival problem, to a great extent, results from \"a continuation of the weak bargaining positioning of the workers in Hong Kong as a whole\" (p. 10). Some research is particularly interested in analysing the role of institutions in linking agency and structure. Institutions are generally de fi ned as cultural values and social practices. In their research, Hoi and Chan ( 2006 ) discuss how restrictive social norms help reconstruct the new arrivals' self.",

The previously dominant thinking, such as the social adjustment agenda and the human capital-de fi cit model, has strongly been challenged by perspectives such as rights-based citizenship, gender and empowerment, and social capital building, over the past 10 years. These new perspectives have enriched our understanding of how migrants' experiences, in the process of migration, are constructed and negotiated. Migrants are no longer treated as a homogeneous entity; instead, they are deconstructed as many social groups with different characteristics, needs, subjectivities and constraints. Research has become more sensitive to multiple realities of their lived experiences and everyday lives. The new perspectives also remind us not to take the migrant \"families\" for granted. Family is not necessarily a haven for migrants but a site of struggle and contestation (Ku and Pun 2004 ) . Migrant research has become more sensitive to the in fl uence of locality. New research methodologies, such as ethnography and participatory action, and new methods, such as photovoice and community map drawing, have been experimented with in order to engage and empower the migrants. The changing perspectives have brought some impact on social provision and delivery. Mentor systems, using migrants' own social networks to provide assistance to one another, have been introduced in a few NGOs.",

This, however, does not mean that they are mutually exclusive, and the boundaries among them are clear-cut. Social capital studies, for example, consider both the role of gender and social networks in access to migrants' citizen rights (Wong 2008 ) . It is also not the intention to create a false impression that the three new perspectives have now got the upper hand while the social adjustment agenda focus on migrant families and quantitative approach to migrant studies has lost their in fl uence. The fact, however, is not so clear. Ngau Tau Kok Caritas Community Centre ( 2001 ) sticks to the information-de fi cit model and produces booklets about the sources of social services for migrants. Hong Kong Integrated Family Services for New Arrivals Project ( 2005 ) still consider the \"migrant family\" as the focus of their service provision (p. 4). These examples show that the old and new perspectives are constantly competing. It is too early to judge which perspectives are more in fl uential than the others.",

First of all, there is a lack of longitudinal research (both quantitative and qualitative) on migrants' lived experiences. He ( 2006 ) has offered a good example, but the length of his observations only lasted for 12 months. This is obviously inadequate for understanding how time and space affect migrants in the process of adaptation. The research funding bodies are advised to create a favourable environment by offering longer term research contracts, such as what the UK and the EU are implementing. Secondly, while ethnography has become more and more popular in migrant studies, researchers need to expand the sites of investigation. After obtaining consent from migrants, researchers can scrutinise migrants' private and public life and follow them to go back to their hometowns in the mainland. This enables us to observe social interactions with kin and friends and that is useful to analyse the dynamics of the cross-border exchange.",

They came to Hong Kong for family reunion and have bene fi ted from receiving higher education in Hong Kong. We, however, do not know a great deal about whether these highly educated, second-generation migrants can effectively represent the needs of poor migrants. Lastly, the current debate on gender and social capital tends to sidestep the role of children. This is related to an assumption that children are dependent and passive, and therefore, their agency is neglected. More research is needed to examine their \"paradoxical\" role-while their presence helps their parents to socialise with others in parks, schools and clan associations, they can have a negative impact on their parents' social capital by refusing to return to China or participate in public events.",
