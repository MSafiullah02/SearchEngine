However, these issues are beyond the scope of the current study. Patients with AHF may have been left without proper guidance that would have directed them to EDs sooner. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted most consolidated approaches to heart disease management, including AHF. 6, 9 Stakeholders should be aware that the risks of delayed access to hospital care for AHF could be even higher than those posed by COVID-19. Moreover, a significant re-engineering of healthcare services should be considered. The implementation of modern communication systems may overcome several emerging problems in the post-COVID-19 era. 10 Online real-time consultations with primary-care physicians and specialists may effectively circumvent the need for patient travel.",
