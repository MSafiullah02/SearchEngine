In a previous report of a case with pneumonia and severe respiratory distress, fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation were the main histopathologic findings.2 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 is possible3 and the pathologic findings in the lungs mentioned by Tian et al.1 should correspond to that case.",
