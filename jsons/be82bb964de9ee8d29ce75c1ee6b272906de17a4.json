N95 and N99 (European FFP2 and FFP3) respiratory masks play an especial role. In order to reliably protect medical personnel, and thus to contain the spread of the pandemic, it is essential to provide at least N95 respiratory masks (FFRs). The WHO estimates that about 89 million FFRs are needed each month to combat the COVID-19 pandemic -with such estimates rising [1] . Meeting this demand implies not only a ~40% increase in the global production of FFRs, but also ultra-rapid delivery of the masks to hospitals, given the current situation. Both are rather improbable.",

However, in recent years the scientific literature has laid out various possibilities to decontaminate FFRs and reuse them several times [2,3,4,5,6,7]. All these methods must meet the following requirements: the masks must be decontaminated, the effectiveness of the mask must not be damaged, the user must not be endangered in any other way (e.g. poisoning) and the masks should be ready for reuse quickly. In addition, the methods should avoid the usage of disinfectants, as these are in short supply in the current situation.",

Several studies have shown that influenza pathogens (H1N1 and H5N1) can be removed up to 99.9% using a rather simple procedure [3,4,6]. In one of the publications, a sealable 6l vessel was filled with 1l of tap water and heated to 65\u00b0C in an oven. The container was then removed from the oven and a respirator mask was positioned above the water surface using a rack. The container was then closed again and placed back into the oven for a 20-minute treatment. The samples were then air-dried overnight. This method can also be used in the COVID-19 pandemic to remove SARS-CoV-2. Upscaling the method is straightforward. To shorten the drying time, placing the treated masks in a drying cabinet is useful.",

In particular, two of the described the methods (warm moist heat and microwave-generated steam) require essentially standard kitchen appliances. All three methods were shown to be successful for disinfecting masks from pathogens.

In the first [3,4,6], two small plastic containers with perforated surfaces (e.g. storage boxes for pipette tips) are filled with 50ml tap water and placed side-by-side in a microwave oven. The FFR is placed face-down on the pipette tip boxes and is then irradiated using a power of 1250 W for 2 minutes. After treatment, the pipette tip boxes are refilled with fresh tap water and the next FFR is decontaminated. In the second procedure [5], the FFR is placed in a 2l microwave steam bag, pouring 60ml tap water into it. These microwave bags are commonly used for steam cooking as well as for disinfecting infant pacifiers or drinking bottles. The bag is sealed and then irradiated with 1100 W for 90 seconds in a microwave oven. It has been shown that these simple procedures can remove 99.9% of influenza pathogens. Limitations: These methods are not easily applicable to all FFRs. If metal parts are installed in the mask, then",

The required decontamination dose for SARS-CoV-2 does not differ significantly from that for the influenza pathogens[10]; thus, UV disinfection can be used in a fully analogous way during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decontamination time can be reduced massively when using several UVc lamps with higher output power simultaneously, as in the food industry, and decontamination can be processed in \"production line mode\" [7].The UVc disinfection units located in hospitals could be put to use for this purpose: It would be an on-the-spot solution. Research laboratories often have such facilities, too.Furthermore, it would be highly desirable to use the existing high-throughput UVc disinfection systems from other industrial branches (e.g. sterilization of cans or yogurt cups) for FFR disinfection. To this end, used masks would have to be collected and delivered to an",

The FFRs are first moistened with tap water and then dried in the tumble dryer. A drying temperature above 56\u00b0C ensures that SARS-CoV-2 viruses are removed, but the temperature is low enough to avoid damage to the FFRs. This would be the case for vented indicated. There is agreement among the investigations that the filtering function of the FFRs is not compromised at all after such treatments. To restore the fitting function, the nosefoam and straps could be replaced after the disinfection procedure.In this paper, we reviewed strategies for disinfecting FFP2, FFP3, N95 and N99 respiratory masks (FFRs) for their reuse based on the existing scientific literature. These methods are intended as emergency solutions only -for situations where there is a critical shortage of the single-use respiratory masks. The methods described here can be done on-site within e.g. a hospital or a medical office, given there is sufficient equipment available, or up-scaled",
