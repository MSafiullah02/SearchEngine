Potential compounds are available for further investigation such as EIDD-2801 (isopropyl ester of N4-hydroxycytidine), Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin and Remidisvir may be considered as its high therapeutic potential in treating emerged viral infection (Wang et al., 2020b; Elfiky, 2020) . Meanwhile, there are not only the antiviral drugs needed for an infected patient but also the prophylaxis e.g. vaccine is required for the uninfected person especially for the healthcare workers. Antibiotics and ventilation support are also utilized in COVID19 patients .",
