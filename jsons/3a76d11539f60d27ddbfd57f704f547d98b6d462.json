            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first reported in December 2019 as a series of cases of pneumonia with an unknown etiology clustered around a food market in Wuhan City, China. 1 The infection spread quickly and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2019. 2 By March 30, more than 782 365 confirmed cases were reported and a third of the world population were living in confinement to try to contain the virus. 3 While the disease itself is often mild, approximately 11% of cases require acute medical care, and this cohort quickly overwhelmed healthcare systems around the world. 4 In anticipation of such a demand, hospitals in many countries quickly stopped all nonurgent visits, procedures, and surgeries, freeing up beds, equipment, and workforce. 5 While neurosurgeons are not on the frontline of COVID-19 management and treatment, they commonly care for critically ill patients who will continue to present with subarachnoid hemorrhages, subdural hematomas, brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and compressive myelopathies while the pandemic occurs. While public health measures such as quarantine and social distancing are proving effective at slowing the spread, 6, 7 surgeons remain in direct contact with their patients throughout their operations. Protecting the surgical team from contracting COVID-19 is of utmost importance as they are both a potential vector for patient contamination and a scarce resource that cannot be easily replaced.",

Human-to-human transmission was well documented early on and contributed to the rapid spread of the disease. 9, 10 The virus has been shown to exploit the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry, as was the case for SARS-CoV, but unlike MERS-CoV. 8, [11] [12] [13] ACE2 is expressed in the human airway epithelium, lung parenchyma, vascular endothelium, kidney cells, small intestine cells, and, to a lesser extent, central nervous system (CNS) cells. 14, 15 This pattern of expression therefore supports the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as the primary sites of entry.",

Such an observation was also made in a SARS patient, 22 and transgenic mice models have demonstrated that SARS-CoV could infect the olfactory bulb neurons and reach the CNS through trans-synaptic spread. 23 There is so far only one published report of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a human patient 24 and no study demonstrating complete virions in either the CSF or the CNS. However, this possibility should be kept in mind and has been proposed by some authors to explain the lack of central breathing drive observed in many intubated severe COVID-19 cases. 21",

To be transmitted, the complete and assembled virus needs to be shed by the contaminated host and transported to an entry tissue in a new potential host. So far, the presence of live virus shedding was confirmed from human airway epithelial cells 1 and feces specimens, occurring even in patients who did not have diarrhea. 16 There is no evidence yet that the fully assembled virus can be detected in the blood, although a controversial study during the 2003 SARS epidemic suggested that blood transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in Hong Kong 25 and many blood transfusion agencies are refusing blood donations from COVID-19 patients. 26 Once outside of the contaminated host, SARS-CoV-2 virions have a half-life of 1.1 h in aerosols, 3.5 h on cardboard, 5.6 h on stainless steel, and 6.8 h on plastic. 27 These observations suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection can occur via direct or indirect transmission. Direct transmission can occur through contact (eg, kissing an infected individual) or droplets (eg, inhaling virion-containing aerosols immediately after an infected patient coughed, sneezed, or talked). Indirect transmission can occur through fomites (such as touching a contaminated surface and then touching one's mouth or nose) or through airborne transmission (such as aerosolization of virions during medical procedures). The current consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through the respiratory and possibly fecal-oral routes. 1, 28 There is no evidence so far for blood transmission 26 and there are conflicting reports on vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. 29, 30 The magnitude of the pandemic highlights how infectious SARS-CoV-2 is. Early estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) range from 2.2 to 6.49 people infected by every contagious individual, compared to 1.28 for the common flu and 1.46 for the H1N1 2009 pandemic. 31, 32 This might be explained by the existence of contagious asymptomatic carriers, 33 which might represent 17.9% of infected individuals, including a high proportion of children. 34",

As such, no reliable data are currently available on the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 testing. While a South Korean study of 10 cases suggested a false-negative rate of 20% for RT-PCR, 36 larger studies will be required to confirm this finding. Meanwhile, new point-of-care tests are also in development and will use different technologies, such as immunoassays and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which will again require validation. 37 There is no test available yet to confirm the immune status against SARS-CoV-2, 37 although combined IgG-IgM assays can now assess exposure. 38 ",

If impossible, fallback options are substitution (replacing the hazard), followed by engineering controls (isolating people from the hazard), followed by administrative controls (changing the way people work), and, lastly, protecting workers using personal protective equipment (PPE).

Many procedures routinely performed under GA in most centers can easily and safely be accomplished under conscious sedation, local anesthesia, and/or spinal anesthesia with the patient wearing a face mask to limit aerosolization in the OR. These include external ventricular drain (EVD) placement, chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) evacuation, 45 carotid endarterectomy, 46 and lumbar discectomy or laminectomy, 47,48 among others. If GA is absolutely required, all unnecessary personnel (including most neurosurgeons) should not be in the room while intubation and extubation are performed. Awake fiberoptic intubation should be avoided if possible, as should any procedure that might induce coughing. 49",

Anecdotal, unpublished reports from China suggest that ENT surgeons might be the most affected of all healthcare workers. For neurosurgeons, this risk arises during trans-sphenoidal approaches, transmastoid approaches, transoral approaches, percutaneous trigeminal rhizotomies as well as craniotomies involving the frontal sinuses, such as bicoronal, bifrontal craniotomies or frontal skull fracture repair. In the setting of a local outbreak or in COVID-19 positive patients, surgeons should try to delay these procedures or use alternative approaches, wherever possible. Most trans-sphenoidal surgeries, for instance, are performed for benign lesions that can usually be delayed until after the pandemic, or at least after the patient's COVID-19 status is negative. For procedures that cannot be postponed (eg, pituitary apoplexy, craniopharyngioma with obstructive hydrocephalus), serious consideration should be given to a transcranial approach (eg, pterional) or an alternative strategy (eg, a cystic craniopharyngioma could be drained through stereotactic implantation of an Omaya reservoir and treated using intracavitary therapies rather than trans-sphenoidal resection). The same applies for translabyrinthine approaches for vestibular schwannomas, which can usually be substituted for a retrosigmoid craniotomy. Whenever performing a craniotomy, extra care should be placed in avoiding the frontal sinuses or mastoid air cells, which can be facilitated by the use of neuronavigation. In frontal sinus fractures, conservative treatment or lumbar drainage could be attempted until COVID-19 status is negative. Patients with trigeminal neuralgia could be offered radiosurgery over rhizotomy, if pain control cannot be achieved pharmacologically. For spine tumors or trauma, dorsal approaches should be favored over transthoracic surgeries to minimize the risk to the lung parenchyma.",

Surgeons should be careful, as always, to avoid these complications and should escalate the PPE requirements and OR decontamination protocol if they happen during a case.

In any of these cases, rongeurs and curettes should be favored over drilling with a burr. Burr holes can be performed using a Hudson brace or a twist drill rather than a perforator, especially for EVD placement or CSDH, where a single hole may be sufficient. [58] [59] [60] In transsphenoidal surgery, rongeurs and chisels can replace high-speed drilling. In the setting of spinal decompression and stabilization, bony removal can usually be achieved with various rongeurs, and manual, tactile pedicle probes are suggested to facilitate the placement of pedicle screws. In any case where drilling is used, the drill could be used at lower speeds and should be stopped when irrigating. Large suctions should be used to aspirate as much particulate matter as possible and isolate the drilling area using a transparent adhesive film (eg, Opsite TM ; Smith & Nephew) \"tent\" or gauzes could be attempted. In spine surgery, the use of navigation as well as minimally invasive techniques such as endoscopic procedures and percutaneous screws should be considered to lower the amount of drilling required. Smoke from electrocautery should be immediately aspirated. The use of lasers and ultrasonic aspirators should be limited. Finally, VP shunt placement could be performed open rather than laparoscopically to avoid the aerosolization created by the carbon dioxide insufflator. 57 Lastly, aerosol-generating instruments should be manipulated by proficient users rather than learners. Some of these intraoperative precautions (including reducing the speed of drilling) have been successfully taken by a group of neurosurgeons in Wuhan city, where most of the focus, however, was on reducing bleeding and shortening the time of surgeries. 61",

Studies are available on mechanisms and sites of entry, virus biodistribution as well as shedding and transmission. Using this understanding, diagnostic tests are being refined, vaccine trials are being organized, and procedures to stop the spread of the virus are being implemented. While not on the frontline of any of these research areas, neurosurgeons can contribute by optimizing their practice to prevent nosocomial infection of patients and healthcare workers. This can be achieved by adapting some steps in neurosurgical procedures to our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and transmission. Table 2 summarizes general measures that are of particular importance to neurosurgeons. These include limiting the number of surgeries performed, limiting the number of individuals in the OR, and performing preoperative testing whenever possible. Table 3 suggests possible adaptations to standard neurosurgical procedures that have the potential to limit nosocomial transmission.

Most controversial is the recommendation to limit the use of aerosol-generating instruments, including drills and ultrasonic aspirators. Indeed, the idea that a respiratory virus could be transmitted by inhaling lumbar vertebrae bone dust can be counterintuitive. This would require aerosolization of virion-contaminated blood or CSF with the bone dust, which has never been proven, neither for SARS-CoV-2 nor for SARS-CoV. Definitely, a surgical protocol should not be modified if it compromises patient safety or the intended surgical outcome.

In the neurosurgical OR, high-risk settings include endotracheal intubation and extubation, procedures involving the respiratory or digestive tracts, and the use of aerosol-generating instruments on virion-contaminated tissues. In addition to supporting general hospital-wide policies, neurosurgeons can contribute to the reduction in the risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare workers by adapting their protocols in COVID-19 patients, high-risk settings, and during local nosocomial outbreaks. Possible changes include postponing all nonurgent cases, reappraising the necessity for GA, considering alternative surgical approaches avoiding the respiratory tract, and limiting the use of aerosol-generating instruments, including drills, electrocautery, ultrasonic aspirators, lasers, and carbon dioxide insufflators.",
