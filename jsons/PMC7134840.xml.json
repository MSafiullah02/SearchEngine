Although we do not know the exact amount of virus needed for clinical disease, to infect more than 200 people with a sole contamination (after dilution of the virus upon leaving the host), the index patient would have needed to excrete a tremendous amount of virus into the environment. A single viral discharge from the index patient has a finite window of infectiousness. Although some research has shown that the SARS virus can live for up to 4 days in diarrhoeal fluid,8 on dry surfaces the survival time is estimated to be 24\u201348 h.8 The Amoy Gardens epidemic, therefore, would have required delivery of the virus to more than 200 people within 1\u20132 days.",

The incubation period in rats infected by naturally occurring coronavirus such as the sialodacryoadenitis virus is short (2\u20135 days), thus the first infected rat would have become contagious around March 19. Naturally occurring coronavirus disease is benign, lasting about 7 days, and there is no carrier state.9 Secretions from infected rats, such as urine, droppings, or saliva, contain large amounts of virus and are highly contagious.9 Roof rats prefer to forage for food above ground in elevated areas.10 They are also territorial and habitual, and tend to follow the same pathways between their nest and food sources and make return visits time after time.11 Their range of activity when looking for food is about 30\u201345 m.11 The lightwell between units 7 and 8 of block E is very narrow (1\u00b75 m) with two separate sewage pipes running vertically along the walls close to the bathroom windows. Clothes-lines are installed outside the bathrooms of each unit, and these almost touch one another, providing convenient bridges for rats to travel up and down the building. The first infected rats would probably have been used to visiting the middle and upper floors of units 7 and 8 in block E, and subsequently made many returns to these units, accounting for the unusual concentration of cases on these floors. Roof rats seldom go to the bottom of a building to look for food, thus the lower floors were spared.",
