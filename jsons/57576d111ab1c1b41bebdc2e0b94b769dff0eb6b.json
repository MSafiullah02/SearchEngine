Carbohydrates with medicinal uses include heparan, which is the most widely used anticoagulant [14] , antibiotics [15] and vaccines [16] . Uncovering the contributions of carbohydrates to cell biology would greatly facilitate advancements in science and medicine; however, such discoveries are hindered by the large investments that must be made to procure carbohydrates of sufficient purity and quantity for biological testing. Several reasons underlie the difficulties involved in obtaining carbohydrates; for example, carbohydrate synthesis is not template-driven and the isolation of carbohydrates from natural sources, although possible, yields only limited quantities of material that is often microheterogeneous. Chemical synthesis and cell biology can aid in procuring defined chemical materials, but non-specialists do not use these experimental routes routinely and molecular biology techniques can be used to transfer glycosylation pathways to bacteria to enable the genetic manipulation of glycan structures. In addition, the automated synthesis of carbohydrates can be achieved, but the synthetic efforts required to get the desired carbohydrates are not trivial [17] [18] [19] . Thus, to use efficiently the limited quantities of carbohydrate that are available, sensitive screening techniques for studying carbohydrates are urgently needed.",

For example, when dextrans of 2000 kDa and 20 kDa were applied to nitrocellulose slides at the same concentration, two times greater loading was observed for the 2000 kDa dextran after the slides were washed.

This suggests the arrays could be used to identify new carbohydrate-protein interactions by screening proteins for binding to mixtures of saccharides. Once mixtures are identified that bind to a protein, the components can be isolated and tested further for binding. At present, this approach seems particularly advantageous because it focuses efforts towards purifying mixtures that have a binding affinity of interest. For example, new carbohydrate-protein interactions have been identified through analysis of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides by antiserum and the binding of an antibody to chondroitin sulfate [23] .",

A systematic study of the retention of lipid-bearing galactose conjugates was undertaken to tackle this problem. The results showed that C 13 -C 15 linked carbohydrates were retained on the plates when the wash buffers did not contain detergents or solvents other than water [24] . Further experiments using a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between a carbohydrate bearing an azido group and an alkynebearing C 14 linker afforded lipid-bearing saccharides that could be immobilized on the plates (Figure 1a ) [26] .",

In the first method, encoded fiber-optic microspheres, each containing a unique covalently attached carbohydrate structure, are incubated with fluorescently labeled ConA and CVN [32] . To aid in their visualization, the beads are internally encoded with fluorescent dyes that represent the carbohydrate immobilized on the bead. Binding is determined by an increase in the fluorescence signal, which is monitored by imaging the arrays under a fluorescence microscope [32] . A standard DNA arraying robot has been used to develop a second method in which thiol-terminated carbohydrates are arrayed on maleimide-functionalized glass slides ( Figure 2 ) [33] . High-density arrays, with several hundred spots per slide, have been constructed. The results from both of these screening techniques show that ConA binds only to mannose displayed on the surface and that CVN binds to mannosides containing part of the D1 arm present on N-linked glycoproteins ( Figure 2 ) [32, 33] .",

Data are from Ratner et al. [33] (Figure 2 ). Carbohydrates were immobilized on self-assembled gold monolayers, which provide the advantage that the density of carbohydrates displayed on these monolayers can be controlled and thus used to present carbohydrates in a homogeneous environment.

Thus, the sensitive approach of arraying carbohydrates on glass slides by a robot can be used even when carbohydrates are in short supply or have been isolated from natural sources. The number of parallel screens performed by a microtiter assay is limited by the number of wells on a single plate, which is typically 96. Arrays can be constructed such that the density of different carbohydrates on a single slide is greater than 10,000 [31] .

There is an urgent need for the discovery of new antibiotics owing to increased antibiotic resistance; furthermore, there are few screening techniques for evaluating interactions between therapeutic targets and enzymes encoding antibiotic resistance in parallel. Aminoglycoside antibiotics have been non-specifically immobilized on slides containing succinimide esters by immobilization via amino groups that are present on these antibiotics [41, 42] . With these arrays, binding to both the target RNA, which is an oligonucleotide mimic of the binding site for the aminoglycoside antibiotic in the ribosome, and to the enzymes encoding antibiotic resistance can be achieved with minimal material (picomoles). Aminoglycoside derivatives that have their amino groups replaced with guanidino groups or guanidinoglycosides have been discovered that inhibit resistance enzymes and are not substrates for these enzymes. By using these screens for testing combinatorial libraries, the discovery of improved antibiotics is likely to be accelerated.",

An in-depth investigation of the binding of this protein to mannosides has been undertaken with high mannose arrays [45] . The results show that the structure of the oligomannoses affects binding and that mannosides that resemble the nonasaccharide most closely show the strongest binding.
