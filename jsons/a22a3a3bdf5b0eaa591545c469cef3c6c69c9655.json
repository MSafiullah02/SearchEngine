Roughly speaking, the analysis of weekly new infections for each day is a tool for the definition and early detection of the turning point of the epidemic. In Italy, the growth of Covid-19 activity was overcome one week ago, Austria and Switzerland followed suit. This note emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19 activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days. We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease afterwards. This note gives a very optimistic outlook for all regions which have taken strict containment measures.",

To describe the global Covid-19 infections, Johns Hopkins University established the now famous database of cumulated numbers of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries, for each day t and each country or region [10] . Here we explain how the series C t of confirmed infections for a certain region can be interpreted and used for prediction. The letter t is commonly used to denote either a date, or a number, like 'day 10 from the beginning of observations'. If t is today, then t \u2212 1 is yesterday, and t \u2212 7 is one week ago. The sequence C 1 , C 2 , ... is usually drawn as a function of t, as shown on the left of Figure 1 . It is rather smooth and ever-increasing. It is compared with exponential growth functions -a too pessimistic viewpoint since containment measures gradually diminish the growth. Another data series is given by the number of new infections on day t,",

The right of Figure 1 clearly shows the course and the apex of the epidemic.

Below we prove that after lockdown conditions there must be a steady improvement during the first two weeks after the turning point -no matter whether lockdown is lifted or not. In this time the danger of infection is extremely low. And if an infection should happen, it will be included in C t only two weeks later. This is a very optimistic outlook, which with a time shift applies to all regions which have taken strict containment measures. Note that the improvement is not visible in C t . Germany has a much smaller total number than Italy, and the same slope, but it reached the turning point several days later. A conventional analysis would emphasize that Spain has largest slope and has just overtaken Italy in the total number of cases, so it should be in bad shape.

China was the first country to go through the Covid-19 epidemic. Figure 2 shows the development of weekly infection numbers W t in Hubei with capital Wuhan, four other Chinese provinces, South Korea, and Japan. This picture conveys an optimistic message. We see that on the right side of the maximum the function decreases exponentially fast, only slightly flatter than on the increasing side. The time in Figure 2 starts just before 23 January when strict lockdown measures in Wuhan were implemented by the Chinese government. Note that the scale of W t is logarithmic between 30 and 40000. The statistics in Wuhan could be the best with so many cases but on Feb 12 the criteria for confirmed cases were changed and 15000 cases added, after 0 cases the day before.

European countries are going through a similar scenario, and Italy was first to overcome the apex in Figure 1 . Figure 2 shows that Covid-19 activity hardly disappears completely. Even with very strong restrictions in Wuhan, it stayed on an intermediate level of 3000 for several days, and then went down to almost zero. In Guangdong the infection potential has again risen above 30. In South Korea, where no emergency measures were implemented, the infection potential decreased up to 700 and then stayed constant. It is not easy to manage Covid-19 activity of such size, but it seems possible for a large and technologically developed country.

While Italy, Switzerland and Austria reached the apex almost together, Spain and Germany came later. The weekly infection numbers of Italy have steadily decreased for 13 consecutive days now. In Spain and Germany these numbers decreased for 6 consecutive days. For Austria and Switzerland the decrease of W t was interrupted. The reason is that N t for small countries is subject to greater statistical variation. (For a Poisson random variable, the 95% confidence radius is 2 \u221a N . Since Covid-19 cases come in clusters, we should take twice that value, so that N = 500 has a statistical error \u00b1100 or 20% while N = 5000 has an error \u00b1300 or 8% .)",

Now we are in the phase of lockdown which is difficult to describe by such models. The spatial aspect has to be taken into account. A first spatial infection model was the contact process [5] , today one would use random geometric graphs [8] .

In Germany, this could probably gain three days for government decisions. An even earlier although not definite information would be provided by a central 24/7 hotline where everybody can apply for a date in a test center, and where basic information on symptoms and contact to infected people can be gathered just after the incubation time.
