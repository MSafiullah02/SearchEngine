In minimally invasive operations that require CO 2 insufflation, depending on the insufflator used, filtration may or may not occur during the entirety of the case. Knowing the viral particle size of COVID-19 ranges from 0.06 to 0.14 microns, the primary concern arises if improperly sized filters are utilized to evacuate smoke plumes. This means that during the progress of a laparoscopic or robotic operation, CO 2 enters in via an inflow cannula and either the CO 2 remains trapped intraabdominally (along with aerosolized virus), or it is recirculated through the insufflator, filtered, then exhausted through the back of the insufflator as room air. If a CO 2 insufflation filter (or a handheld suction device in an open operation) is too large to capture the smaller RNA viral particles, aerosolized viral particles are essentially being concentrated within the exhaust and then expelled out of the rear of the insufflator.",

CONMED Corporation\"). This open-circuit should be avoided to circumvent a jet-like stream of aerosolized virions within the pneumoperitoneum. CON-MED has published mitigation strategies by using constant negative pressure smoke evacuators on other valved ports, but this does not stop valveless trocar leak, it only tries to minimize it.

That said, a primer on the utility and efficacy of surgical masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) is also warranted. \"N95 respirators made by different companies were found to have different filtration efficiencies for the most penetrating particle size (0.1-0.3 micron), but all were at least 95% efficient at that size for NaCl particles\" [15] . To obtain the stated filtration rate, N95 masks require a fit test and a tight seal around the mouth and nose to afford maximal (yet still imperfect) benefit.
