In 1978, PEDV was identified as the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) [1], which is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with high mortality often reaching 100% in neonatal piglets. At the end of 2010, a PEDV outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China [2,3]. Since then, the disease has spread throughout other provinces, which has resulted in enormous economic losses to the pork industry in China [4,5]. At present, PEDV infection is widely circulated in swine-farming countries in Asia, Europe, and North America [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV have resulted in severe economic losses and poses significant public health concerns worldwide.",

            "text": "Point, insertion, and deletion mutations of the PEDV genome have been frequently reported, leading the genetic diversities of PEDV epidemic strains [[10], [11], [12]]. According to the nucleotide sequences of the viral complete genome, PEDV strains are classified into the classic GI group or the variant GII group [13,14]. The GI group includes the subgroups GI-a and GI-b, while the GII group consists of the subgroups GII-a and GII-b. Global PEDV strains are also defined as the S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains, which correspond to the GI and GII groups, respectively, according to mutations of the spike (S) protein of PEDV [10,15,16]. In China, the variant subgroups GII-a and GII-b are classified as PEDV pandemic strains circulating in pig populations [9,14,17,18]. Recently, Guo et al. (2019) analyzed the complete genomes of 409 PEDV strains form different countries, which were classified into five subgroups strains (GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c) [14]. Recombination analysis indicated that the GII-c subgroup strains evolved from a recombination event between subgroups GI-a and GII-a. These data suggest that the Chinese PEDV pandemic strains have undergone genetic variations, leading to the genetic diversities of PEDV pandemic strains.",

Identification of the PEDV-positive samples was performed according the methods described by Wang et al. (2016) [12]. Viral isolation was conducted in accordance with the PEDV isolation protocol described by Jiang et al. (2018) [24]. Upon the development of a cytopathic effect (CPE), the viruses were harvested from the culture supernatant for serial passages. The isolated viruses were identified by electron microscopy (EM) and with the use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). For the IFA, Vero cells were inoculated with PEDV isolates at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 36 h and then were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%). After blocking with 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies (dilution, \u00d7 500) against the spike (S) protein of PEDV for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody against immunoglobulin G (dilution, \u00d7 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The monoclonal antibodies against the spike (S) protein was kindly provided by the Division of Swine Digestive System Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope. For EM, the samples were negatively stained as previously described (Jiang et al., 2018). The viral suspension was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 30,000\u00d7g for 30 min to pellet the viral particles, which were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). The negatively stained samples were examined using a Hitachi-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The PEDV isolate was named strain HM2017.",

Macroscopically visible plaques were picked with a pipette pick, dissolved in 1 mL of DMEM, frozen and thawed for three times after receiving poison, and then inoculated in Vero cells for propagation in preparation for the next round of plaque purification. The plaque purification operation was repeated five times. After incubation for 48 h, the agarose was covered.

The clinical manifestations of PEDV infection of the stomach were distension due to undigested milk curd, while the small intestinal tract was distended, transparent, and filled with yellow fluid (Fig. 8\nA). Histopathological analysis indicated shortening, fusion, and sloughing of the small intestinal villi of the PEDV-infected piglets (Fig. 8B). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PEDV virions were present in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the atrophied small intestinal villi of the PEDV-infected piglets (Fig. 8C).",

The various epidemic strains of PEDV differ in virulence and immunity, leading to incomplete immune protection of commercial vaccines against infection with various PEDV epidemic strains. In order to investigate the genetic evolution and pathogenic characteristics of PEDV, viral isolation was conducted using PEDV-positive samples collected in China from 2015 to 2018. In the present study, the PEDV strain HM2017 was successfully isolated from Vero cells and showed good cellular adaptability, as the viral titer of passage 15 was 1.33 \u00d7 107 TCID50/mL. The PEDV strain HM2017 was classified to the variant subgroup GII-a. Moreover, PEDV strain HM2017 was strongly virulent to suckling piglets, as characterized by severe clinical symptoms, high viral RNA titers shed in feces, gross lesions within the small intestine, shortening of the small intestinal villi, and a mortality rate of 100% by 84 hpi.",

The PEDV strains in the variant GII group are closely related to the frequent occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which has resulted in huge economic losses to the pork industry worldwide [9,13]. The PEDV strains in the variant GII group appear to be genetically diverse with a gradual increase in number reported globally. Guo et al. (2019) reported that group GII PEDV strains can be classified into subgroups GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c, according to phylogenetic analysis of 409 complete genomes of global strains, of which the GII-c is a newly discovered subgroup [14]. In fact, the GII-c subgroup was genetically separated from the GII-a subgroup due to the inconsistent topologies between the S gene and other genes. In the present study, a genome-based phylogenetic tree of 532 global PEDV reference strains was generated. These PEDV reference strains included subgroups GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c (the genotype of each has been defined in previous studies). In the present study, PEDV strain HM2017 and 384 Chinese PEDV reference strains formed the group GII-a, and the PEDV strains from the subgroup GII-a showed genetic diversities. The results of genomic similarity analysis indicated that the PEDV strain HM2017 exhibited high similarity with these reference strains from the subgroups GII-a and GII-b. The PEDV HM2017 strain identified in our study and seven reference strains formed a unique clade, differing genetically from other reference strains of the subgroup GII-a. These data suggest that Chinese PEDV subgroups GII-a strains have undergone genetic variations, forming potential novel clades.",

In the present study, PEDV strain HM2017 of subgroup GII-a was strongly virulent to suckling piglets, similar to that of the PEDV strains of subgroups GII-a and GII-b [5,33]. However, as a slight difference, 66.67% (12/18) of the experimental animals infected with strain HM2017 developed only mild diarrhea at 12 hpi, while strain HM2017 caused a significant increase in body temperature at 36 hpi with fecal shedding of high titers of viral RNA at 12 hpi and 100% mortality by 84 hpi [34]. Moreover, the viral loads were notably high in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon of the animals infected with strain HM2017, which is agreement with the report by Jung et al. (2014) [32]. Additionally, PEDV strain CH/JLDH/2016, which was classified into subgroup GII-a, was also highly pathogenic to piglets [18]. These data demonstrate that the PEDV strains of the developing GII-a subgroup are highly virulent and pose a serious threat to the pig populations in China.",
