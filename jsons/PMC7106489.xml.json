Recently, PCR based assays have made it possible for novel viruses to be discovered, leading to appraisal of the clinical impacts of these viruses and several other well-known respiratory viruses [1], [2], [3], [4]. Some of these viruses are detected alone in specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms (sometimes in those of inpatients) but their pathogenicity is not clear because they are detected simultaneously with other viruses in many cases [5], [6], [7]. As a result, the clinical importance of these findings for the symptoms is not known.",

RT reactions were performed using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was then amplified using Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO) with a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. Each sample was amplified containing primers and probes specific for each of the targets as described in Table 1\n[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. The sensitivity of each of the real-time PCR methods was evaluated by detecting serial dilutions of quantitated plasmids that contained each target DNA clone. For detection of FluV A and B, we used the one-step real-time RT\u2013PCR method because of its increased sensitivity. Enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were genotyped by direct sequencing. Amplification of the VP4/VP2 region of the enterovirus or rhinovirus for typing was performed with semi-nested RT\u2013PCR as previously described [8]. The purified PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing with a BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed using the DNADynamo program (Blue Tractor Software, UK). Using MEGA5.2 (Tamura et al., 2011, Ver5.2.2), we employed the neighbor-joining method [14] to construct phylogenetic trees from the VP4/VP2 region (420nt) sequences retrieved from GenBank of prototype isolates of each rhinovirus type commonly used in epidemiologic studies of human rhinoviruses [9], [10], [11] and new types proposed previously [9], [12], [13]. Genotypes were assigned on the basis of their clustering with known prototype reference strains.",

RVs and EV/RV untyped were the viruses most frequently detected in samples from asymptomatic children. Current diagnosis of respiratory infections is mainly done using PCR methods. Due to their high sensitivity, it is difficult to determine the exact explanation for positivity in individual participants (e.g., post-viral shedding, asymptomatic infection, or incubation before symptomatic infection). We were able to clarify the active asymptomatic infection by testing gargle specimens of the same children once a week for one year.",

            "text": "RVs are most commonly isolated from persons experiencing mild upper respiratory illness (common cold). Recent studies have reported that those viruses are responsible for severe infections of the lower respiratory tract in children. These viruses play a critical role in exacerbating asthma and chronic lung diseases [15], [16]. However, most studies were conducted with symptomatic patients. Few studies have investigated the existence of the viruses in children without any respiratory symptoms [17], [18]. One study reported that, after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection, rhinovirus RNA may take a long time (5\u20136 weeks) to disappear from nasal mucus [19]. In this study, the children who could gargle might have been relatively older, but RVs were often detected in their throats at a time without symptoms. It seems that RV infection is in most cases asymptomatic or mild. As the sensitivity of the real-time PCR was 100 copies, it can be assumed that the virus might have replicated to some extend. The same RV genotype was detected in two consecutive samples of a child and another RV genotype was detected in the next sample. These findings suggest that RVs do not exist in the upper respiratory tract for a long time even if a child does not show symptoms which were probably the result of interferon response to a virus multiplication.",

In addition to a low hPeV prevalence in respiratory samples, a high rate of coinfection with other respiratory viruses has been observed in hPeV-positive samples [1], [20]. With monthly sampling, hPeV was detected in the stools of 48% of healthy Finnish infants by the age of 22 months [21].

Most respiratory viruses infect the upper or lower airway and replicate in airway epithelial cells. In patients with normal immunity, these viruses are cleared immediately and it is generally thought that prolonged infection is rare. Therefore these respiratory viruses must repeat human-to-human transmission to continue to be present in the human population. As PCR is a nucleic acid amplification method, it remains unknown whether the respiratory viruses detected in the specimens from asymptomatic children are infective or not. Respiratory viral infection without any symptoms may play an important role in the viral circulation in human populations.",
