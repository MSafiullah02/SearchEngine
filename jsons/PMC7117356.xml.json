Bovine enterotoxaemia occurs most frequently in beef cattle and is referred to as \u201cBelgian Blue calf enterotoxaemia\u201d, although other breeds can suffer of this syndrome (Manteca and Daube, 1994, Manteca et al., 2000). The infectious aetiology of bovine enterotoxaemia has not been formally identified yet, but C. perfringens is often regarded as responsible (Popoff, 1989, Manteca and Daube, 1994, Songer, 1996). A recent survey of more than 70 typical cases in Belgium confirms toxin type A C. perfringens as putative aetiology (Daube et al., 1996, Manteca et al., 2001). However, if the \u03b1 toxin is highly pathogenic for all species the reproduction of typical necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions has been performed only in chickens (Daube, 1992, Songer, 1996, Petit et al., 1999).",

Because of the similarity of the lesions observed in calves with enterotoxaemia (Manteca et al., 2000) and of those associated with the \u03b22 toxin-producing C. perfringens isolates in piglets, the following study was done: (i) the collection of C. perfringens isolated from the bovine enterotoxaemia cases was re-examined by colony hybridisation for the presence of \u03b22 toxin-encoding genes; (ii) \u03b22-positive and \u03b22-negative C. perfringens isolates were compared by ribotyping; and (iii) \u03b22-positive and \u03b22-negative C. perfringens isolates were compared in a ligated intestinal loop assay in one calf for the production of intestinal lesions.",

Epidemiological data favour a role for instance in horses and cattle (Griffiths et al., 1998, Netherwood et al., 1998, Manteca et al., 2001), and in vivo role of the \u03b1 toxin has been proved in necrotic enteritis in poultry (Popoff, 1989, Daube, 1992, Songer, 1996). The identification of \u03b22-toxigenic C. perfringens isolated from several animal species with, sometimes necrotic and haemorrhagic, enteritis and enterotoxaemia revived the discussion (Gibert et al., 1997, Herholz et al., 1999, Klaasen et al., 1999, Garmory et al., 2000, Gkiourtzidis et al., 2001).",

The isolation of a \u03b22-positive C. perfringens from the intestinal content thus does not confirm the clinical diagnosis of bovine enterotoxaemia, as the probability of this calf being enterotoxaemic is only 0.6.
