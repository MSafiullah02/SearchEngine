            "text": "The importance of psychosocial stress as a risk factor for a variety of negative health outcomes is widely recognized. Stress induces endocrine and immune system responses that help coping with the change in demand (McEwen, 1998) and stressors exert these influences by regulation of genes. Findings from previous gene expression studies in animal models show changes due to acute stress exposure cannot be readily translated to the human paradigm (Fujikawa et al., 2000, Liberzon et al., 1999). It has been suggested that peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression may provide an indicator of gene activation changes as a response to stress in humans (Segman et al., 2005), as lymphocytes have been shown to be perturbed following acute psychological stress (Aloe et al., 1994), probably mediated through endocrine and immune markers that are activated by the stressor. Only very few studies have investigated gene expression alterations due to stress in humans. Studies examining genome-wide transcriptional activity in PBMCs have been reported. One examined chronic isolation and showed it was associated with specific signaling pathways involved in immune regulation and biological stress responses (Cole et al., 2007). A more recent study associated chronic care-giving stress with alterations in glucocorticoid signal transduction as reflected by altered gene expression compared to a control group (Miller et al., 2008). Microarrays, which allow high-throughput profiling of transcriptional activity, are powerful tools that detect signatures of biological processes that underlie adaptive and maladaptive responses to a challenge of the system. Measurement of expression of multiple genes or even genome-wide transcriptional activity patterns is warranted. Previous studies have not attempted to study gene expression alterations using more than one single measurement time point. However, considering the complex chronology of biological processes that occur due to exposure to an acute stressor, repeated measurement of gene expression is crucial. In the current pilot study, we attempted to repeatedly measure gene expression patterns using a genome-wide approach allowing us to examine biological pathways changes that follow an acute psychosocial laboratory stressor in adult healthy men. As this is a \u201cproof of concept\u201d approach that will drive future research endeavors using a repeated measurement approach, no hypotheses about alterations in specific pathways were formulated. Therefore, the following analyses should be regarded as explorative in nature and will hopefully inform future decisions on formulating specific hypotheses. However, we expected to find changes in processes that are relevant for the biological response to stress. In particular, psychological stress is known to activate the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis (Charmandari et al., 2005). The HPA axis plays a fundamental role in regulating other homeostatic systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the immune system. Cortisol exerts inhibitory effects on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, and helps return these cytokines to baseline levels after stress. Increased sympathetic responses may mediate increased immune responses especially during stress. Thus, we expected changes in gene expression profiles that were closely related to changes in these biological stress systems.",

The data was quantile normalized and log2 transformed.

Gene sets for this analysis were derived from 593 BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com), or 181 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and 65 experimentally verified transcription factor targets. We identified pathways whose expression was differentially regulated among the classes. By analyzing gene sets, rather than individual genes, we were able to reduce the number of tests conducted, and allow findings among biologically related genes to reinforce each other. This analysis is different than annotating a gene list using gene ontology (GO) categories. For each gene set we computed the number of genes represented on the microarray in that group, and calculated the statistical significance for each gene by a univariate analysis using a paired t-test with a random variance model (Wright and Kirby, 2003). Then, for each gene set two p-value summary statistics (the Fisher (LS) and the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) statistics (Simon and Lam, 2004) and the Efron\u2013Tishirani's maxmean test statistic (Efron and Tishirani, 2007) were calculated. The significance level associated with the gene set is the proportion of the random samples giving as large a value of the summary statistic as in the actual genes of the specified gene set. We considered a gene set to be significantly differentially regulated if one of the tests was <0.05.",

Eight pathways were identified as common to each of these analyses (bold highlight, Table 3, Table 4) involving 210 unique genes.

In our analysis these effects from psychosocial stress are reflected in changes in acute inflammatory response pathways (see Table 3, 33\u201336), and pathways regulating adhesion molecules (Table 3, 1\u20135). The effects of the leukocytosis are more apparent in the baseline-stress analysis than the stress\u2013recovery time period, as a greater number of pathways are associated with cell migration and adhesion in the former compared to the latter. In addition, stress response pathways associated with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) appear to be associated with the stress\u2013recovery period (Table 4, 29\u201332). A variety of pathways were significantly changed between baseline and stress, involving basic cell regulatory and signaling processes, many involving cell growth, differentiation and proliferation (Table 3, 17\u201329). Also, it was noted that ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) was central to the functioning of several pathways in the baseline\u2013stress analysis (Table 3, 1, 2 and 16). This protein is a pleiotropic regulator of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, cell\u2013cell adhesion, and motility (through the actin network). Thus, all these pathways are implicated in the adhesion and diapedesis of immune cells from the lymphatic system to the blood stream. A shortfall in this pilot study was that we did not monitor the cell subsets during the course of the time series, which is essential for larger scale studies, so we can account for the differences in the gene expression profiles being driven by the changes in T cell, B cell and natural killer cell populations.",

The immediate physiological consequences of the stress response are evident in the analyses seen here, i.e. immune activation and energy mobilization. However, genes in the three pathways associated with the cell cycle, cell differentiation, etc., showed mixed regulation of the genes, and genes that were up- (or down-) regulated in the baseline-stress analysis were still up-regulated in the stress\u2013recovery analysis (Supplementary file 2).

The first two interact with each other to form the NF-\u03baB transcription complex. This complex is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress and plays a key role in regulating the immune response (Avitsur et al., 2003, Bhatara et al., 1998). In fact, it has recently been identified as a potential critical bridge between stress and cellular activation (Bierhaus et al., 2003, Rosecrans and Karin, 1998). Another common transcription factor regulating the differentially expressed genes in the common pathways was NR3C1, a transcription factor that binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) and is a modulator of other transcription factors. It affects inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation and differentiation. SPZ1 is involved in regulating genes involved in cell growth and differentiation, while ELF5 is an ETS-domain transcription factor, which regulate a diverse range of biological functions including mammalian hematopoiesis (Sharrocks et al., 1997).",

Exploring the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the baseline-stress GSEC analysis (Supplementary file 3) we see 19 genes are identified with the NF-\u03baB/RELA TFBS combination and eight genes are up-regulated \u22652-fold between baseline and stress, while only three of these genes are down-regulated. Three of five genes with NR3C1 (GR) promoter sequences in the JAK/STAT pathway are down-regulated (Supplementary file 3). We find that the cortisol effects are evident in the gene expression patterns during the time series analysis. This indicates by using state-of-the-art methodologies we can explore the biological changes of psychological stressors.",

Also, not all genes measured in the microarrays were annotated and genes that might be critical for the stress response might thus have been omitted from our analysis. Related to this issue, only a fraction of the annotated genes are summarized in a pathway. To some extent, we were able to address some of these limitations by analyzing gene sets, rather than individual genes, thus we were able to reduce the number of tests conducted, and allow findings among biologically related genes to reinforce each other. This functional class scoring is a more powerful method of identifying differentially expressed gene classes than the commonly used over-representation analysis, or annotation of gene lists based on individually analyzed genes (Simon and Lam, 2004). It indicates which gene sets contain more differentially expressed genes than would be expected by chance. Further, we were able to measure gene expression patterns at three time points (immediately before and after, as well as 30 min after an acute stressor) in our current study. It would have certainly been of great interest to have further measures beyond that time frame. Longer lasting changes in the endocrine, immune, and sympathetic nervous system could not be captured in our study. Clearly, future studies need to incorporate more measurement time points in order to be able to capture the complex biological processes that occur following an acute stressor. Also, increasing both sample size and sampling time points will allow us to more closely describe cellular events in a chronological order as they occur before, during, and after a stressor. Finally, we chose to use a within-subject measurement approach. This allowed us to examine changes of biological pathways after exposure to an acute stressor. However, further studies that will expand our current efforts will benefit from including a control condition in which no stress intervention occurred. This will allow discerning baseline and stress-related processes.",

Specific pathways may be changed in specific disorders in response to psychosocial stress. Our pilot study needs to be replicated and future studies will expand our current findings by including more subjects. The stress-related changes that we were able to describe are most likely adaptive responses to a moderate stressor. It might be of great interest to use this approach in clinical samples. Identification of gene expression patterns relevant for psychiatric and somatic disorders that are related to stress has the potential to identify novel targets for the prevention and treatment of adverse outcomes of stress.",
