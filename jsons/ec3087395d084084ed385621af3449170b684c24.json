There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as the major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. Here, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and provide a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with the infection.",

In the past two decades, CoVs have become a major public health concern due to potential zoonotic transmission, as revealed by the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, which infected 8, 000 people worldwide with a mortality rate of 10-15%, and MERS-CoV in 2012 and 2019, which infected 2, 500 people with a mortality rate of 35%, and now SARS-CoV-2 (WHO).",

SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells depends on the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to its cognate receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on the cell surface [2] . ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, yet these viruses induce profoundly different morbidity and mortality suggesting unknown determinants of coronavirus pathogenesis [5, 6] . Additionally, proteolytic priming of the S protein by host proteases is also critical for viral entry [7] . The cellular serine protease Type II transmembrane (TMPRSS2) is used by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming [8, 7, 9, 10] . This is also used by SARS-CoV alongside the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L [11, 12] . Another host protease, furin, has been suggested to mediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis; however, the precise role of host proteases in SARS-CoV-2 entry remains to be determined [13, 10] .",

By utilizing scRNA-seq and electron microscopy, we revealed that ciliated cells are a major target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 extend to other epithelial cells including basal and club cells. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited intrinsic expression of type I and type III interferons and IL6 but not IL1 transcripts.

Exponential viral replication over the course of the experiment was demonstrated by qRT-PCR of cell lysate for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene (Fig 1B) . At 1, 2, and 3 days postinfection (dpi), a single cell suspension was generated and 3' single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 77,143 cells across four samples cells per sample with an average of 31,383 reads per cell (Fig 1C, S1A ). To define SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we mapped reads to the viral reference genome and quantified viral transcript abundance on a per cell basis (Fig 1D) . We defined productively infected cells as those with at least ten viral transcripts per cell, which controls for background due to misaligned reads in the mock sample. Consistent with the viral genome replication (Fig 1B) , we observed a time-dependent increase in the abundance of infected cells from 1 to 3 dpi (Fig 1E, S1B) .",

The distribution of polyadenylated viral transcripts shifts from 3' to 5' during the infection time-course (Fig 1F,G,S1C ). Mapping of productive infected cells reveals multiple infected cell clusters that expand over time and are not present in the mock sample ( Fig 1H) . Using RT-PCR, we successfully validate two unique peaks, one that mapped in the middle of the Open Reading Frame (ORF)1ab region, and a second peak that mapped near the ORF6 boundary (Fig S1D, top panel) . Our results confirm that RT-PCR products corresponding to each of the two peaks appears after 2 dpi (Fig S1D, bottom panel, red arrows). Importantly, the absence of these RT-PCR bands in the mock and 1 dpi samples suggests they are not the result of non-specific oligo-d(T) priming of cellular or viral RNAs. We included two positive controls, amplifying RT-PCR products of increasing length from the canonical SARS-CoV-2 poly-A tail ( Fig S1D, bottom panel, green arrows) . These RT-PCR bands appear as early as 1 dpi, are specific to infected cells and run at their expected lengths. These positive controls validate that we are able to capture known poly-adenylated viral transcripts with this RT-PCR priming strategy.",

We sought to determine the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in the bronchial epithelium, as the airway is a critical target of viral pathogenesis. Clustering a BB-kNN graph by Louvain community detection resulted in identification of eight major clusters comprising canonical epithelial cell types: ciliated cells, basal cells, club cells, goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells, ionocytes, and tuft cells (Fig  2A, S2A) . We also observed a cell population intermediate between basal cells and club cells (BC/Club) likely representing basal stem cells differentiating into club cells. Analysis of differentially expressed genes reveal these cell clusters express classical epithelial cell type-specific markers (Fig 2B) . Mapping viral infected cells within specified epithelial cell types reveals that ciliated, basal, club, and BC/Club cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection whereas goblet, neuroendocrine, tuft cells, and ionocytes are relatively resistant to infection (Fig 2C,D) . At 1 dpi, ciliated cells represent 83% of infected cells and continue to comprise the majority of infected cells throughout infection (Fig 2E,F) . However, during productive infection, the number of infected basal, club, and BC/Club cells also increases, suggesting that these cells are major secondary targets (Fig 2E,F) .

The transcriptional data generated is of high quality, with an average of between 2,400 to 3,600 unique genes detected per condition. Our data reveals several novel viral transcripts and our methodology differentiates infected from bystander cells. Further, we demonstrate that ciliated cells are the major target cell of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the bronchial epithelium at the onset of infection and that cell tropism expands to basal, club, and BC/club cells over time.

We developed a novel method to differentiate productively infected cell types by the distribution of the sub-genomic and genomic viral transcripts. We also identified polyadenylated viral transcripts remote from the 3' end of the viral genome, which was unexpected given our sequencing method. Our RT-PCR validation experiments confirm the production of at least two unique, TRS-independent transcripts with poly-A tails that do not appear to result from non-specific oligo-d(T) priming. As the reported recombination rate for coronaviruses is high [23, 24] it is possible these short reads correspond to non-specific polymerase jumping. However, recent studies have identified TRS-independent chimeric RNAs produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells, a small portion (1.5%) of which are fused in frame [25] . Taken together with our results, this may suggest non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs with coding potential are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, this would require further validation. HCoV-299E non-structural protein 8 (nsp8) was recently shown to possess template-independent adenyltransferase activity [26] . Because poly-A tails play important roles in the stability and translation potential of canonical SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs, it is interesting to speculate that coronaviruses might rely on the production of non-canonical, poly-adenylated sgRNAs to serve as decoys for cellular deadenylases. This would result in preservation of the poly-A tails of the genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Indeed, the production of sgRNAs during flaviviral infections is important for resistance to cellular exoribonucleases and innate immune evasion [27, 28] .",

Ciliated cells, which are abundant in the respiratory epithelium, propel mucus and associated foreign particles and microbes proximally away from the lower airway. Our finding that ciliated cells are the predominant target cell of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the bronchial epithelium has several important implications. First, dysfunction of ciliated cells by infection by SARS-CoV-2 may impair mucociliary clearance and increase the likelihood of secondary infection. Second, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking are associated with both cilia dysfunction and increased severity of COVID-19. Whether these underlying conditions alter ciliated cells and thus increase their susceptibility to infection remains unclear. The cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal epithelium and lower airway remain important areas of future investigation which will further enhance our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

This is in contrast to seasonal human coronaviruses and implicates an important role for the host immune response in COVID-19 progression. Several recent studies have revealed seemingly contradictory roles regarding SARS-CoV-2 induced innate immunity [31, 32] . Here, we show that the innate response to SARS-CoV-2 is intact and rapid, as characterized by interferon, chemokine, and IL-6 induction. Interestingly, while we do not observe broad depletion of virus-susceptible cell populations, we detect increased expression of cell-death associated genes, which suggests the host anti-viral response is cytotoxic and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Consistent with this, IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and serum IL-6 levels predict respiratory failure [33] . Therapies targeting the IL-6 receptor are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. This work raises a number of important future directions including whether other airway and endothelial tissues similarly interact with SARS-CoV-2 and how these interactions vary in vitro.",
