Even if slightly variable, national regulations usually provide for similar standard test conditions, and FFR from different countries can be referred as 'equivalent'. [3] During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some institutions had to rely on private donations for PPE provision. Besides, many healthcare workers have decided to get their PPE on their own, from unofficial retailers or using e-commerce. In this context, it may be difficult to perform quality control checks, with the risk for healthcare of receiving and using low quality products or frauds in clinics. Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Counterfeit FFR are defined as 'products that are falsely marketed and sold as being NIOSH-certified and may not be capable of providing appropriate respiratory protection to workers, and altered FFR as 'nonapproved modifications to a NIOSH-certified respirator'. [4] Beside the lack of availability, the cheapness of counterfeit FFR is another common reason for their easy spread in the market. The presence of an industrial lockdown, imposing a stop to non-necessary productions, can also lead factories to perform a rapid reconversion towards the production of FFR, thus contributing to the attractiveness of counterfeiting. Moreover, FFR can be altered just to enhance their appearance. This is the case of the so-called 'fashion respirators', including original respirators with additional logos, decorations or materials glued or stapled. All these cases represent risks for workers' safety.",

[6] The European Commission offers an alert system for dangerous products, including FFR, to receive reports from the authorities of the member states about suspected products found on the market. Through the EU commission portal, users can search for alerted products, seeing pictures, characteristics and if measures were ordered by public authorities. It is also provided a list of contacts to make a report to national authorities. [7] To date, the risk of infection associated with the use of counterfeit FFR has not been estimated since no specific data are available. However, it is reasonable to believe that counterfeit FFR pose an additional risk of contagion to healthcare workers due the potentially lower protecting capacity. An analysis conducted by the U.S. National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) demonstrated that the filtering capacity of not NIOSH-approved FFR can vary considerably,from 24.1% to equal to the standard (minimum level >95% for N95 type). [8] Healthcare workers should alert local competent authorities when in doubt about the appropriateness of FFR in use. Should healthcare workers' safety rely on the individual ability to detect counterfeit FFR before using? Are institutions making all the possible efforts to avoid making these products available to healthcare workers?",
