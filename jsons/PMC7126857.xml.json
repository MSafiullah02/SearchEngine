Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor users were identified and enrolled after hospital discharge after the first weaning from AKI-D. The index date was the date of the first DPP4i prescription. Participants in the control cohort (patients without DPP4i use) were assigned the same index dates as the corresponding patients in the DPP4i cohort. To investigate patients\u2019 medication adherence and its effect on mortality, we calculated each patient\u2019s medication possession ratio (MPR)16 for DPP4is and selected the patient group with an MPR not less than 70% as a target group to contrast with DPP4i nonusers. Patients who used DPP4is at 1 year were enrolled, and the mean MPR of DPP4is was 82.8%.",

Variables used in the propensity score\u2013matching analysis are included in the analysis if the P value was less than .10. Then each patient was weighted by the inverse probability of receiving the treatment that they actually received; the weight was calculated on the basis of the propensity score\u2013matched value. Weights for DPP4i users were the inverse of the propensity score, and weights for DPP4i nonusers were the inverse of 1 \u2013 propensity score. The process of IPTW generates 2 new pseudo-cohorts. This process enabled us to preserve the sample size in the pseudo-cohorts close to the original cohorts, albeit not strictly equivalent.17, 18\n",

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may prevent inflammation and fibrosis of the heart and kidney by decreasing the oxidative stress response of heart and kidney tissues.31 Experimental studies using various diabetic models suggest that incretins protect the vascular endothelium from injury by binding to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress and the local inflammatory response, which reduces albuminuria and inhibits glomerular sclerosis.32 The renal effects of DPP4is might be explained indirectly by glucose-independent mechanisms such as an improvement in blood pressure control33 via down-regulation of the sodium/hydrogen antiporter 3 in the proximal tubule.34 Vildagliptin, a DPP4i, was reported to decrease apoptosis, as evidenced by a 2-fold decrease in B cell lymphoma-2\u2013associated X protein/B cell lymphoma-2 messenger RNA expression and significantly decreased messenger RNA expression of the proinflammatory marker C-X-C motif chemokine 10 in the ischemia-reperfusion injury animal model.35 Macrophage phenotype switching from M1 to M2 subtype facilitates renal repair after AKI.36 In an animal study, sitagliptin-mediated inhibition of early atherosclerosis was due to M2 polarization during monocyte differentiation via stromal cell-derived factor 1/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 signaling,37, 38 which facilitated kidney repair. Renal recovery in AKI is compromised by perturbations of the cell cycle with arrest in the G2 phase and production of proinflammatory and profibrotic signals.29 It has been suggested that DPP4is may improve oxygen supply and mitigate the inflammatory response after ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving recovery of sublethally injured cells. Furthermore, in the immune system, DPP4 acts as a marker of T-cell activation in which it functions as a costimulatory molecule.39 Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is expressed in activated CD4+ T cells as well as in injured renal tubular epithelial cells; thus, chronic KIM-1 expression may provide a mechanistic link between AKI and subsequent renal fibrosis.40 It is possible that DPP4is inactivate CD4+ T cells, which have been identified as the primary pathogenic T cell in experimental AKI,41 and may attenuate KIM-1 expression.",

First, this study is the first to report an association of DPP4i use with a lower risk of ESRD and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes weaning from AKI-D. Our study population included only patients with DM who were hospitalized for AKI, and the result is consistent in patients with comorbidities such as congestive heart failure and cardiovascular disease and in those who had received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Second, our data, derived from a current nationwide population-based cohort, enabled tracing of nearly all the AKI episodes associated with DPP4i use. All claims records of outpatient visits and hospital admissions were included, and diagnoses were included from both sources.",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, given the impossibility of treatment randomization in this retrospective and observational study, the influence of potential confounding factors not evaluated herein may have biased the results. For example, laboratory data (eg, hemoglobin A1c level) were not available in the NHIRD claims data. However, we used surrogate indicators to adjust for patients\u2019 baseline diabetes severity, such as the number of outpatient visits. We further added the frequency of hemoglobin A1c measurements to the final model and found similar results (Supplemental Result 1, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). High blood pressure is a well-known key for progression of kidney disease and death, but there were no blood pressure data in the NHIRD. We used joint modeling of multiple diseases to capture the effect of hypertension to investigate geographic variations in risk.69 Recent studies reported that congestive heart failure,70, 71 atrial fibrillation,72 and peripheral artery disease73 are highly related to hypertension and could be used as proxies for hypertension. Although we do not have any variable directly reflecting hypertension, we could assume that we have controlled the effect of hypertension because we have included the above-mentioned 3 diseases as proxies for hypertension and added them to the final model (Supplemental Result 2, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). To further avoid potential residual confounding due to inadequate adjustment for unevaluated biases, we used the IPTW model to balance every clinical characteristic between the 2 groups. In addition, we matched patients using the propensity score analysis with propensity score and reanalyzed mortality by using propensity score\u2013adjusted logistic regression. Consistent with our IPTW analysis, the propensity score\u2013matching analysis revealed that the use of DPP4is mitigates mortality in patients with diabetes after weaning from AKI-D (Supplemental Table 2, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).",

Although there are no estimated glomerular filtration rate and CKD stage classification in the NHIRD, we have devised a way to differentiate the severity of CKD using the NHI data. We categorized patients with CKD with concomitant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents prescription as those with \u201cadvanced CKD.\u201d9 More than 75% patients with advanced CKD are found to be anemic.74 Therefore, patients with such prescription are highly likely to have advanced CKD. We adjusted preadmission CKD, advanced CKD, postdischarge CKD, and advanced CKD, and found that in patients with advanced CKD, the use of DPP4is after discharge was independently associated with decreased mortality. Most importantly, these factors exhibited a severity-dependent risk to mortality. Finally, a future study will clarify the mechanisms underlying the differences in incident ESRD for different DPP4is. However, our results may only be generalizable to the population with DM, with an AKI episode covered by the universal health care insurance program.",
