Secondary thoracic neoplasms of rats include mesotheliomas, lymphomas,14, 15 histiocytic sarcomas,3, 16 and metastatic mammary adenocarcinomas among others.3 Some authors have postulated that thoracic radiographs may be useful for differentiating mycoplasmosis from thoracic neoplasms in companion rats.1 In dogs, the distribution of lesions among lobes may give an indication of the possible nature of pulmonary neoplasms.17 In addition, in domestic carnivores, a solitary well\u2010defined pulmonary nodule and multiple circumscribed nodules or masses are considered imaging signs of pulmonary neoplastic diseases.17, 18, 19, 20, 21 However, a nodular pattern has also been related to infectious diseases.22, 23, 24, 25 Some textbooks have suggested that radiographic interpretation of rodents may be extrapolated from domestic animals.26\n",

None of the lesions were mutually exclusive; hence multiple thoracic lesions could be described for a single patient if observed. If some lesions prevented evaluation of other characteristics (for instance a severe pleural effusion preventing evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma), the nonevaluated category was classified as not observed.

Among rats diagnosed with mycoplasmosis (8/23; 35%), diagnosis was achieved via postmortem PCR in seven cases. Mycoplasma culture of the lungs was submitted in 15 cases and the result was positive in one case. Four rats had a negative Mycoplasma culture with a concomitant positive Mycoplasma PCR and PCR was not submitted in the single case with a positive Mycoplasma culture result.

Rotation was common on the lateral view, which was often scored as 2. A steep thoracic curve in rats and consequently radiographic rotation precluded evaluation of tracheal deviation; hence this criterion was not used to evaluate the set of radiographs included in this study. For VD and DV views, 15 radiographs were scored as a 1, 12 radiographs were scored as a 2, and three radiographs were scored as a 3. Overall, 52 radiographic views (52/60; 87%) were found to be fully interpretable. Radiograph interpretation results are shown in Table 2. Overall radiographic lesions were detected in only 25 of 30 cases diagnosed with postmortem thoracic lesions (sensitivity = 83%). Five rats presented with infectious disease (5/23; 22%) and none of the rats presented with neoplastic disease (0/7; 0%) had normal radiographs (P = 0.30). The distribution of pulmonary lesions among the different lobes did not vary significantly among groups or within each group. Overall, 16 rats had bilateral pulmonary lesions (16/30; 53%), one had lesions only in the right lung lobe (1/30; 3%), and four had lesions only in the left lung lobe (4/30; 13%). The lateralization of the lesions (P = 0.09), type of pulmonary pattern (P = 0.85), and other criteria of radiographic interpretation did not differ significantly among groups. Pulmonary vessels could not be clearly visualized due to the small size of the thorax: no vascular pattern was described. One case exhibited a bronchial pattern and multiple mineral opacities with linear shapes in the right caudal lung lobe suspected to be airway associated. No unstructured interstitial pattern was described. Rats diagnosed with thoracic neoplasia in this study were significantly more likely to display mediastinal lesions (P = 0.03; Fig. 1). Mediastinal lesions cranial to the heart were significantly more frequent in the neoplastic group (P = 0.05), whereas prevalence of a mediastinal lesion caudal to the heart was not significantly different among groups (P = 0.23).",

Lateral thoracic radiographs positioning involves applying gentle cranial traction on the forelimbs of the patient without causing the trunk to be twisted, so that the sternum lies in the same horizontal plane as the spine.26 The forelimbs should be drawn as cranially as possible to prevent summation onto the cranial lung field.26 Radiolucent foam wedges may be used to prevent rotation.26 In ventro\u2010dorsal and dorso\u2010ventral thoracic radiographs, the patient positioning should be such that the sternum is projected precisely over the spine.26 The spine is placed under slight traction by gently pulling on the fore\u2010 and hindlimbs with tapes placed on each of the limbs.26 Collimation should allow visualization of the caudal contour of the diaphragm and the caudal quarter of the neck to be able to follow the course of the trachea.26 In the present study, a majority of radiographs were scored as a 2 (i.e., mild rotation), or a 3 (i.e., major positioning abnormality partially impairing interpretation, such as superimposition of thorax and forelimb), illustrating the difficulty for obtaining perfect radiographs in dyspneic rats.

In domestic carnivores, a right lateral view will allow a better visualization of the left hemithorax due to right lung potential atelectesis and the opposite is true for the left lateral view.38 Similarly, comparing right lateral and left lateral views was beyond the scope of this study and sensitivity of each lateral view for detecting thoracic lesions is likely to vary depending on lesion distribution.",

            "text": "Compared to radiographic interpretation of dogs and cats, interpretation of thoracic radiographs in rats carried some additional challenges due to the small size of the patient and limits of spatial resolution. Pulmonary vessels were not visible in any of the studied radiographs. Additionally, due to the small size of the thorax, differentiating well\u2010defined and ill\u2010defined nodules was challenging when the spatial resolution did not enable clear visualization of the nodule's margin. Alveolar pattern, changes in the mediastinum and pleural abnormalities were easily identified on rat's radiographs in this study. Unstructured interstitial pattern was not diagnosed in any rat, as it may have been indistinguishable from normal lung due to spatial resolution limitations. In most cases, diffuse pulmonary interstitial opacity was considered as artifactual; therefore the prevalence of changes to the structure of the lungs without nodular or alveolar disease could have been underestimated in the present study. Although the thymus causes a characteristic widening of the cranial mediastinum in rats,26 a radiographic diagnosis of a cranial mediastinal mass was suggestive of round cell neoplasia in four cases. However, at the individual level, mediastinal lesions could be associated with both thoracic infectious disease and neoplasia. One rat's radiographic diagnosis was in favor of neoplasia but the cranial mediastinal mass was actually diagnosed as a very large abscess on necropsy, while lymphoma was confirmed in the three other rats. Mediastinal lesions were a common feature of thoracic neoplasms in this dataset. This finding can be explained by the majority of cases being affected by round cell neoplasia causing lymphadenopathy. Hence, suspicion of a cranial mediastinal mass should prompt further diagnostic investigations such as thoracic ultrasound or computed tomography.",

In a clinical setting, ultrasound\u2010guided fine\u2010needle aspirations of thoracic masses may allow antemortem diagnosis of lymphomas in rats. Characterization of the type of lymphoma detected in the enrolled patients was beyond the scope of the study.",

Necropsy results were deemed necessary to rigorously assess the significance of the radiographic lesions detected and this limited the sample size. The population of companion rats enrolled in this study may also have been biased as it was collected from a referral center, included dyspneic rats that worsened despite treatment. As a necropsy was available during the following month after radiographs were obtained, it is possible that more advanced cases of respiratory disease were likely selected compared to the general rat population. The time frame between radiograph acquisition and postmortem examination was also a limitation of the study, as thoracic disease could have progressed in the interim. Some rats received antimicrobial treatments between radiograph acquisition and postmortem examination, which could have decreased the extent of their lesions in some cases and could have negated microbiologic cultures. In addition, screening for bacterial agents through microbiologic tests and special stains was not performed for all rats and testing for viral agents was beyond the scope of the study. Finally nonpathogenic Mycoplasma spp. were likely detected via PCR. The PCR used in these rats has a low specificity, as M. pulmonis is regarded as the only clinically significant Mycoplasma in rats3 but other Mycoplasma species were detected with the primers used in the present study.33 This could have led to erroneous conclusions regarding the cause of pneumonia in some patients. For this reason, rats with infectious bronchopneumonia were grouped together regardless of the infectious agent detected. Due to the delay between radiographic and postmortem tests, it was also not feasible to compare radiographic and histopathologic lesions in each pulmonary lobes. Patients were therefore considered as a whole entity affected by a disease.",

Sex and age were not predictors of infectious or neoplastic diagnoses. Mediastinal lesions, especially cranial ones, were significantly more prevalent in the group diagnosed with thoracic neoplasia. Rats with mediastinal masses were most often affected by round cell neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs obtained from rats with pneumonia might show pulmonary nodules and alveolar pattern representing abscesses, and mediastinal shift due to volume loss and necrosis. Pleural effusion was seen in both groups. Comparing combinations of radiographic lesions (alveolar lung pattern, mediastinal lesion or shift, and pleural abnormality) in a larger companion rat population may help orient diagnosis toward neoplastic or infectious disease in rats presented with dyspnea.",
