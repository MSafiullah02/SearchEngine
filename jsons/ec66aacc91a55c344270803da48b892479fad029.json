A wide variety of natural replicons exhibit the properties that allow them to act as cloning vectors, however, vectors may also be designed to possess certain minimum qualification to function as an efficient agent for transfer, maintenance, and amplification of target DNA. An ideal cloning vehicle would have the following four properties: \u2022 Low-molecular weight \u2022 Ability to confer readily selectable phenotypic traits on host cells \u2022 Single sites for a large number of restriction endonucleases, preferably in genes with a scorable phenotype \u2022 Ability to replicate within the host cell, so that numerous copies of the recombinant DNA molecule can be produced and passed to daughter cells.",

            "text": "Cosmids are hybrids between a phage DNA molecule and a bacterial plasmid or are basically a plasmid that carries a cos site, the substrate for enzymes that package k DNA molecule into phage coat proteins. The in vitro packaging reaction works not only with one genome but also with any DNA molecule that carries cos site separated by 37-52 kb of DNA. It also needs a selectable marker, such as ampicillin resistance gene, and a plasmid origin of replication, as cosmids lack all the k genes, therefore do not produce plaques. Instead colonies are formed on selective media, just as with a plasmid vector. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40-45 kb-much more than Cosmids provide an efficient means of cloning large pieces of DNA. Because of their capacity to carry large fragments of DNA, cosmids are particularly attractive for constructing libraries of eukaryotic genome fragments. Partial digestion with a restriction endonuclease provided suitably large fragments. However, there is potential problem associated with use of partial digests in this way. This is due to the possibility of two or more genome fragments joining together in the ligation reaction, hence creating a clone containing fragments that were not initially adjacent in the genome. The problem can be overcome by the size fractionation and dephosphorylation of the foreign DNA fragments so as to prevent their ligation together. But this method is very sensitive to the exact ratio of target-to-vector DNAs because vector-to-vector ligation can occur. Such difficulties have been overcome in a cosmid-cloning procedure devised by Ish-Horowicz and Burke (1981) . By appropriate treatment of the cosmid vector pJB8, left-hand and right-hand vector ends are purified which are incapable of self-ligation but which accept dephosphorylated foreign DNA. Thus, the method eliminates the need to size the foreign DNA fragments and prevents formation of clones containing short foreign DNA or multiple vector sequences. Figure 1 .2 describes the cosmid-cloning procedure devised by Ish-Horowicz and Burke (1981) .",

YACs are useful for the physical mapping of complex genomes and for the cloning of large genes. First described in 1983 by Murray and Szostak, a YAC is an artificially constructed chromosome that contains a centromere (CEN), telomeres (TEL), and an autonomous replicating sequence (ARS) element which are required for replication and preservation of YAC in yeast cells. ARS elements are thought to act as replication origins. A YAC is built using an initial circular plasmid, which is typically broken into two linear molecules using restriction enzymes. DNA ligase is then used to ligate a sequence or gene of interest between the two linear molecules, forming a single large linear piece of DNA.",

However, YACs are significantly less stable than BACs, producing ''chimeric effects'': artifacts where the sequence of the cloned DNA actually corresponds not to a single genomic region but to multiple regions. Chimerism may be due to either coligation of multiple genomic segments into a single YAC, or recombination of two or more YACs transformed in the same host yeast cell. The incidence of chimerism may be as high as 50 %. Other artifacts are deletion of segments from a cloned region, and rearrangement of genomic segments (such as inversion). In all these cases, the sequence as determined from the YAC clone is different from the original, natural sequence, leading to inconsistent results, and errors in interpretation if the clone's information is relied upon. Due to these issues, the Human Genome Project ultimately abandoned the use of YACs and switched to BACs, where the incidence of these artifacts is very low.",

In response to this, the YAC system was developed. Although yeast can carry the DNA as large as one Mb, subsequent studies indicated that yeast system presented several difficulties in the creation of a human genome map. Additionally, yeast cells were not as familiar to molecular biologist as E. coli. To circumvent these difficulties, a bacterial cloning system based on the well-characterized E. coli F factor, a low-copy plasmid that exist in a supercoiled form was developed by Hiroaki Shizuya in 1992. A BAC is a DNA construct, based on a functional fertility plasmid (or F-plasmid), used for transforming and cloning in bacteria, usually E. coli. F-plasmids play a crucial role because they contain partition genes that promote the even distribution of plasmids after bacterial cell division. The BAC's usual insert size is 150-350 kb. The replication of F factor is strictly controlled by the regulatory functions of E. coli; as a result F factor is maintained as a low-copy number (i.e., one or two copies per cell). This allows stable maintenance of large DNA inserts and reduces the potential for recombination between DNA fragments carried by the vector, which was a limitation observed with cosmid-cloning system. In addition to stable maintenance, the structural stability of Ffactors allows complex genomic DNA inserts to be maintained with a great degree of structural stability in the E. coli host. The structure of a typical BAC is given in Fig. 1.4 .",

Many experiments designed to find mammalian origins of replication could not identify specific sequences responsible for mammalian genome replication. However, the structure of human TEL was soon described as an array. The confirmation came from the observation of newly formed TEL in the a globin gene, caused by insertion of (TTAGGG) n sequence. The discovery of the telomeric sequence as a tandemly repeated (TTAGGG) n sequence orientated 5 0 -3 0 toward the end of the chromosome and its role in telomere formation led to the development of telomere-mediated chromosome fragmentation (top-down approach), which allowed the isolation of minichromosomes in somatic cell hybrid. The first ''top down'' approach or TACF (telomere-associated chromosome fragmentation) involved modifying natural chromosome into smaller defined minichromosomes in cultured cells. Following recombination and subsequent breakage between homologous sequences on the endogenous host chromosome and an incoming telomere containing the targeting vector, engineered minichromosomes as small as 450 kb in size in avian cells have been generated. The approach has been important for studying the structure, sequence organization, and size requirements of the human X and Y chromosomes.",

Together, the generation of minichromosomes and de novo HACs has identified alphoid DNA as the major sequence element of the CEN and determined the minimum size (*700-100 kb) required for CEN function and stability.",

Although this technology is less advanced than virus derived vectors, HACs have several potential advantages over currently used episomal viral vectors for gene therapy applications. The presence of a functional CEN provides a longterm stable maintenance of a HAC as a single copy episome without integration to the host chromosomes. There is no upper size limit to DNA that should be cloned in HAC that allows the use of complete genomic loci, including the upstream and downstream regulatory elements. Additionally, being solely human in origin, HAC vectors cannot evoke adverse host immunogenic responses or induce any risk of cellular transformation.",

All engineered vectors have an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker. Genome size varies among different organisms and the cloning vector must be selected accordingly. For a large genome, a vector with a large capacity is chosen so that a relatively small number of clones are sufficient for coverage of the entire genome. However, it is often more difficult to characterize an insert contained in a high capacity vector. The development of extrachromosomal large-capacity cloning vectors for mammalian cells represents a powerful tool for functional genomic studies. Further, the advances in genome library construction and DNA sequencing are mainly due to the development of high capacity vectors such as cosmids, BACs, PACs, YACs, and HACs.",
