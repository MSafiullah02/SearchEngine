            "text": "Dengue was confined to only nine countries before 1970. However, it has now been spread to more than 100 countries in the tropical, subtropical and temperate areas of North America, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. According to one estimate, it affects 50\u2013100 million people every year [1]. In fact, World Health Organization has declared dengue as the fastest communicable mosquito-borne disease in the world in terms of human morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. The causes of emergence and resurgence of dengue disease are attributable to multiple factors including urbanization, fast transportation, economic development and changes in human behavior. The fast increase in modes of transportation, their reach, speed and efficiency led to the global movement of human population [2, 4]. This may be responsible for the spread of infectious diseases from isolated locations to the new regions. It has been reported that another 100 million people travel to dengue affected areas where they not only increase the risk of contracting the disease but also spreading it further afield.",

The origin of all four dengue serotypes is found to have in Asian forests and subsequently they have spread worldwide because of the migration of human and commerce [5]. The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main carriers of these viruses. It is transmitted through infected mosquito bites. Once a person becomes infected by a serotype, he/she will never be reinfected by that serotype due to induced lifelong immunity against it. However, only temporal cross immunity is developed against the other serotypes [6]. Therefore, the recovered individuals from a serotype may get secondary infection when exposed to a different serotype. Primary infections are generally asymptomatic and nonfatal, while secondary infections sometimes lead to the fatal forms of dengue infection, namely, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1, 7]. Mathematical modeling has been applied to understand and control the many vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, leishmaniasis, chagas diseases etc [8\u201313]. Some mathematical models on dengue dynamics incorporating primary and secondary infection have been proposed and analyzed by various investigators [11\u201316].",

Some studies on dengue have also confirmed that human migration is the main cause of its spatial spread [18, 19]. In particular, human movement was identified as an important factor for the spread of dengue serotype-1 from the southern region of Vietnam to its northern and central regions [20]. Also, human migration from one patch (area) to another increases the chances of secondary infection [6, 21]. During 1977\u20131978, the dengue epidemic in Cuba occurred due to DEN-1 serotype with not a single case of DHF [22]. However, human migration from endemic countries (with DEN-2 serotype) to municipalities in Cuba has been reported to be responsible for DHF/DSS cases of subsequent epidemics in 1981 and 1997 [22, 23]. These facts exemplify the two largest outbreaks of secondary infection cases by DEN-2 in Cuba in 1981 and 1997 [22\u201324]. Further, human migration may be one of the reasons for the spread of secondary infection.",

However, the level of primary/secondary infection changes without affecting the disease-free/endemic status. On the other hand, when rate of migration is different in the patches, the persistence/extinction of infection will depend on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number of patches as well as the migration parameters.",
