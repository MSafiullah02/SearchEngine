            "text": "Different types of camouflage (i.e., masquerade, disruptive and distractive coloration, surface disruption and countershading) are generated by a combination of skin patterns and colours selected through evolution in many prey and predator species as a means to reduce the likelihood of detection (crypsis) (Skelhorn & Rowe, 2016). In general, they are not mutually exclusive and work best when several of their components match the background colour (Eterovick et al., 2018). The matching of skin pigmentation to background colour can be genetically determined (defined here as \u201cbackground matching\u201d), or induced by physiological plasticity through differential secretion of hormones by neuroendocrine systems (\u201cbackground adaptation\u201d) (Baker & Bird, 2002; Hoekstra, 2006). An example of genetically based background matching are mutations that produced a hyperactive melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r), the main receptor for \u03b1\u2010melanocyte\u2010stimulating hormone (\u03b1\u2010MSH) (Robbins et al., 1993). The emergence of genetic polymorphisms in Mc1r expressed by pigment cells, and the selection of standing genetic variations, resulted in adaptive evolution of background matching in populations of reptiles, birds and mammals (Linnen et al., 2013; Price & Bontrager, 2001; Rosenblum, Hoekstra, & Nachman, 2004). In contrast, background adaptation is plastic, with colour change mediated by pigment cell receptors activated by hormones secreted after eye photoperception of surface colour. Although background adaptation occurs in many species, differences exist in the mechanisms between species that are not well understood. Here, the evolutionary analysis of three critical genes involved in background adaptation, proopiomelanocortin (pomc) and pro\u2010melanin\u2010concentrating hormone genes (pmch and pmchl\u2010\u201clike\u201d (pcmhl)) that encode for \u03b1\u2010MSH and two melanin\u2010concentrating hormones (MCH and MCHL), respectively, provides an explanation for these differences.",

            "text": "Background adaptation is mediated by the secretion into the circulation of two hormones, \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH (Figure 1). These hormones interact with specific receptors expressed by skin pigment cells to trigger the dispersion/aggregation of intracellular pigments (secretion of pigments in mammals and birds), or the synthesis of specific pigment types (e.g., eumelanin or pheomelanin), which define skin colour. \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH form the basis of two current theories that explain background adaptation in vertebrates: (a) a \u201cdual\u2010hormonal theory\u201d in teleosts, with \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH (we rename here MCHL) darkening and lightening the skin, respectively, and (b) a uni\u2010hormonal system in tetrapods, in which plasma \u03b1\u2010MSH levels regulate background adaptation (Kawauchi, 2006). During evolution, however, the capacity of \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH to act as hormones and/or to interact with skin pigment cells changed, as did their roles in background adaptation. For example, skin melanophores in species from early phylogenetic lineages, before the appearance of holosteans, do not respond to MCH (Baker & Bird, 2002; Sherbrooke & Hadley, 1988), while in more recent lineages, for instance amphibian and reptilian tetrapods, MCH either has no effect or triggers pigment dispersion (Ferroni & Castrucci, 1987; Wilkes, Hruby, Castrucci, Sherbrooke, & Hadley, 1984). Moreover, while an MCH is released into the bloodstream in teleosts, this does not appear to be the case for MCH in other taxa (i.e., sharks [Chondrichthyes], amphibians, birds and mammals [Tetrapodas]), where it may not act as a hormone (Baker & Bird, 2002; Cardot, Fellmann, & Bugnon, 1994; Cardot, Griffond, Risold, Bl\u00e4hser, & Fellmann, 1999; L\u00e1z\u00e1r, Maderdrut, & Merchenthaler, 2002; Mizusawa et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The existence of a second hormone secreted from the pars nervosa of the pituitary, with opposite effects on background adaptation to \u03b1\u2010MSH, was suggested initially by Hogben and Slome (1936) in their \u201cdual\u2010hormonal control\u201d theory. MCH is processed from the C\u2010terminal end of the preprohormone PMCH (Figure 1). In fish, an \u201cMCH\u201d peptide is produced in the hypothalamus and transported down axons to be secreted from the neurohypophysis upon stimulation (Baker & Bird, 2002; Enami, 1955; Kawauchi, 2006; Kawauchi, Kawazoe, Tsubokawa, Kishida, & Baker, 1983) (Figure 1). The ability to adapt to a white background by aggregating melanosomes associates with the synthesis and secretion of an \u201cMCH\u201d in several teleost species (Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, Martens, & Wendelaar Bonga, 1995a; Kishida, Baker, & Eberle, 1989; Mizusawa et al., 2012; Sugimoto, Nagamori, Yasui, & Oshima, 1997). Thus, a dual\u2010hormonal control of regulation by \u03b1\u2010MSH and an MCH with \u201chormonal status\u201d may exist in fish. MCH can also act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator to regulate physiological processes associated with feeding and energy homoeostasis (Amano & Takahashi, 2009; Ludwig et al., 2001; Matsuda et al., 2007).",

The single PMCH gene of mammals and birds contains three exons and encodes a prohormone that generates an MCH that acts as a neurotransmitter (Breton, Presse, Hervieu, & Nahon, 1993; Cui et al., 2017; Nahon, Presse, Bittencourt, Sawchenko, & Vale, 1989). Zebrafish have this gene, named originally pmch2 (renamed here pcmh), but also possess a one\u2010exon gene that ultimately produces a peptide with \u201cmelanin\u2010concentrating activity\u201d (Berman et al., 2009; Ono, Wada, Oikawa, Kawazoe, & Kawauchi, 1988; Takayama, Wada, Kawauchi, & Ono, 1989) (Figure 1). The mammalian MCH, encoded by the three\u2010exon gene, is almost identical to the 17\u2010a.a. fish \u201cMCH,\u201d encoded by the single\u2010exon gene (Berman et al., 2009; Kawauchi, 2006; Kawauchi et al., 1983; Nahon et al., 1989; Ono et al., 1988). Because rat MCH was characterized after the fish peptide, both received the same name (Nahon et al., 1989). Synteny analysis indicates, however, that the mammalian and zebrafish three\u2010exon genes are linked evolutionarily, and higher similarity exists between the MCH peptides encoded by the three\u2010exon genes than that by the one\u2010exon gene (named hereafter pmchl) (Figure 2a) (Berman et al., 2009). A few studies have compared the expression of the pmch genes in fish adapted to different backgrounds (Berman et al., 2009; Kang & Kim, 2013; Mizusawa et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010), but it is unclear whether it is MCH or MCHL that mediates teleost background adaptation. Moreover, an evolutionary analysis of pmch and pmchl genes is lacking.",

We used the phylogeny of chordates to analyse the evolution of pomc, pmch and pmchl genes. We suggest an explanation for the differences in the mechanisms that evolved to regulate background adaptation by inferring ancestral relationships, and assessing associations with plastic colour change, the ability of \u03b1\u2010MSH, MCH and MCHL peptides to be synthesized and secreted and to work as neuroendocrine hormones, as well as their effects on skin pigmentation. We propose that the evolution of background adaptation relates mainly to key changes in the pmch genes, with the topological structure of the pomc gene and the \u03b1\u2010MSH a.a sequence both conserved during evolution. We show that the intron\u2010less pmchl gene appears only in the Teleostei lineage, possibly as a result of an ancestral retroposition or during the teleost\u2010specific genome duplication (TSD). Based on our analyses, we suggest renaming the intron\u2010less gene, originally named pmch in several fish (Kawauchi, 2006; Ono et al., 1988; Takayama et al., 1989), as pmchl, which is in concordance with the current zebrafish nomenclature convention and reflects its evolutionary origin. PMCHL gained \u201chormonal status\u201d and is found only in teleosts, while the three\u2010exon pmch peptide product was conserved as a brain neurotransmitter that regulates feeding behaviour. To be consistent with the evolutionary origin of both genes, in this paper we call the mammalian and fish three\u2010exon gene, and the prehormone and the peptide generated, as pmch, PMCH and MCH, respectively, and the fish intron\u2010less gene, pmchl, and its corresponding peptides PCMHL and MCHL. Of note, special care should be taken with the literature, as a different nomenclature was used.",

The data are more convincing, however, for MCHL having \u201chormonal status.\u201d At physiological concentrations (<1 nM), MCHL induces greater melanosome aggregation in cultured skin melanophores and xanthophores than MCH (Mizusawa et al., 2015). Further, MCHL is the \u201cfactor\u201d with melanin\u2010concentrating capacity that was shown initially to be secreted by the pituitary of catfish (Parasilurus asotus) (Enami, 1955), and was then purified from the pituitary of Chum salmon (O. keta) (Figure 2a) (Enami, 1955; Kawauchi et al., 1983). Finally, pmchl mRNA is upregulated in organisms with a white background (Berman et al., 2009; Kang & Kim, 2013; Mizusawa et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010), and pmchl overexpression in medaka (Oryzias latipes) increases MCHL plasma levels and lightens the skin, but leaves feeding behaviours unchanged (Kinoshita et al., 2001). These data argue that MCHL has hormonal status.",

In order to answer this question, we used two experimental models: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the African clawed frog (X. laevis), which possess MCH/MCHL and only MCH, respectively (Figure 2a). Of note, studies have defined the hormonal status of an MCH in fish based on the immunohistochemical detection of MCH+ axon fibres that project to the neurohypophysis (Baker, 1993; Baker & Bird, 2002; Powell & Baker, 1988) and/or the biochemical detection of MCH peptides in blood (Baker et al., 1984; Kishida et al., 1989). Those studies, however, were performed before it was known that two pmch genes exist, and used polyclonal antibodies raised against either mammalian MCH (human or rat) or salmonid MCHL (Coho salmon), which likely cross\u2010react in that MCH and MCHL a.a. sequences are almost identical (Figure 2a). In order to compare the background adaptation response between the two model systems, we grew three\u2010day\u2010old zebrafish and Xenopus larvae for 5 days with a white or a black background, and then measured skin pigmentation (Bertolesi et al., 2015). Both species showed melanosome aggregation and a light skin colour with a white background (Figure 2b). Next, we asked whether the pmch+ and pmchl+ neurons in zebrafish and the pmch+ neurons of Xenopus are present in the hypothalamus, and project axons to the neurohypophysis. Of note, in zebrafish pmch and pmchl are expressed by different neurons (Berman et al., 2009), arguing for distinct roles of the two peptides. We used a polyclonal antibody raised against human MCH, alongside in situ hybridization for pmch and pmchl. The antibody labelled both pmch+ and pmchl+ cells in zebrafish, indicating it recognized both peptides.",

Together, these results suggest that in fish MCHL possesses hormonal status to regulate background adaptation, while MCH in fish and frogs likely acts as it does in mammals, as a neurotransmitter that participates in physiological responses associated with homoeostasis and feeding behaviours (Figure 2c).",

To address this possibility, we assessed in species across evolution first the presence of a physiological background adaptation response, via an analysis of the literature, and, second, the structure and sequences of the pomc, pmch and pmchl genes and their corresponding peptides. Thus, the evolution of the physiological background adaptation response was inferred by comparison of extant organisms grouped in 16 clades (taxonomic classes or orders) as referred to by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (https://www.itis.gov/) (Figure 3).",

Background adaptation occurs in the Esociform Esox lucius, as well as in several species of salmonids, including Oncorhynchus mykiss, and the Chum salmon (O. keta) from which an MCH peptide (we call MCHL) was originally purified (Kawauchi et al., 1983). Studies in salmon helped reveal the dual\u2010hormonal mechanism, in that circulating MCH/MCHL and \u03b1\u2010MSH levels increase with a white and black background, respectively (Baker et al., 1984; Kishida et al., 1989) (Figure 3 and Table S1). Finally, Group 8, Acanthomorpha, are collectively known as the spiny\u2010rayed fish (Figure 3).

Melanocytes are the only pigment cells found in the integument of birds and mammals. With the development of feathers and fur in birds and mammals, respectively (thermal insulation systems), melanocytes became secretory, contributing melanin to surrounding keratinocytes to determine feather/hair pigmentation (Lin et al., 2013; Parichy & Spiewak, 2015). Common climate factors may have contributed to evolution of endothermy in both lineages, since the oldest preserved fossils with fur (Ji, Luo, Yuan, & Tabrum, 2006) and feathers (Prum & Brush, 2002) with insulation capacity come from a similar evolutionary time, but arose independently in the Avian\u2010Sauropsida (birds) and Synapsida (mammals) lineages (Lovegrove, 2017) (Figure 3; blue circle; feathers and fur). Background adaptation in both lineages involves neuroendocrine regulation of coloration through melanocyte deposition of eumelanin (grey/black) or pheomelanin (orange/red) into feathers and fur, though colour in birds comes also from the dietary contribution of pigment carotenoids (Roulin & Ducrest, 2013).",

We focused first on the gene structure of pmch, analysing mainly organisms whose genome was fully sequenced and listed in the NCBI gene database with the exon\u2013intron structure and gene identification number (Table S3). The three\u2010exon gene appears conserved during evolution, as it is present in all groups in which we were able to find the gene, from Chondrichthyes (Group 2) to Mammals (Group 16). In contrast, the intron\u2010less gene is present only in teleost fish (Groups 6\u20138; Figure 4 and Table S3). Teleosts possess ~30% more pigmentation\u2010related genes than tetrapods, most of which were duplicated and retained during the TSD and are involved in specification and differentiation of pigment cells (Braasch, Brunet, Volff, & Schartl, 2010; Lorin, Brunet, Laudet, & Volff, 2018). Thus, the idea that pmchl was retained in Teleostei by evolutionary pressure selection on a gene with a key role in pigmentation regulation (e.g., background adaptation) is tempting.",

Because the intron\u2010less gene is present in fish, but is not conserved during evolution, we suggest naming this gene pmchl in accordance with Zebrafish Nomenclature Convention. Two pmch and two pmchl genes exist in species of the taxonomic order Salmoniform, but only one in non\u2010salmonid species of Group 7 (i.e., Esociform Esox lucius) or Group 6 (D. rerio) (Figures 4 and 5 and Table S3). Variants of pcmh and pcmhl originated presumably as a result of the salmonid\u2010specific fourth vertebrate whole\u2010genome duplication (SS4R), which occurred 80 mya in the common ancestor of the salmonid lineage (Lien et al., 2016) (Figure 3, yellow rectangle in Group 7). We suggest the genes should be named pmcha and pmchb, and pmchla and pmchlb, respectively. pmchla and pmchlb are present in O. keta (named MCH1 and MCH2) (Ono et al., 1988), O. mykiss (MCH1 and MCH2) (Baker, Levy, Hall, & Lightman, 1995), O. tshawytscha (MCH1 and MCH2) (Minth, Qiu, Akil, Watson, & Dixon, 1989) and O. kisutch (MCH1) (Nahon, Presset, Schoepfer, & Vale, 1991). We find four variants in the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which express the mRNAs (Leong et al., 2010) (Figure 5 and Table S3). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted proteins of the Group 7 salmonids and the Esociform Esox lucius shows that PMCHA and B, and PMCHLA and PMCHLB are related to PMCH and PMCHL from Esox lucius, respectively, but appeared more recently in evolution (Figure 5). This result, together with the absence of the intron\u2010less gene in Holostei and Tetrapoda, suggest that pmchl was generated early in the Teleostei lineage, possibly by retroposition or during the TSD with loss of the intron/exon organization. The TSD occurred ~320 mya, following the split of Teleostei from the other three taxonomic classes (Cladistei, Chondrostei and Holostei), but prior to the divergence of the other major Teleostei groups (Figure 3; TSD) (Hoegg, Brinkmann, Taylor, & Meyer, 2004).Thus, the three\u2010exon pmch gene was probably the original gene and conserved throughout evolution, while pmchl appeared in the teleost lineage. Both pmch and pmchl duplicated more recently in salmonids (SS4R). Of note, mammalian genomes contain a single MCH gene with three exons (NM_002674.3; gene number 5367), and two MCH\u2010like genes, PMCHL1 (NR_003921.1; gene number 5369) and PMCHL2 (NR_003922.1; gene number 5370), but the latter two genes arose during primate evolution and are chimeric (non\u2010coding) four\u2010exon pseudogenes of unknown function (Courseaux & Nahon, 2001).",

In mammals, PMCH is processed to MCH and neuropeptide glutamic acid\u2010isoleucine (NEI) (Viale et al., 1999), a 13\u2010a.a. peptide that affects the hypothalamic\u2013gonadal axis (Bittencourt & Celis, 2008; Fujimoto, Fukuda, Sakamoto, Takata, & Sawamura, 2017). Conserved sequence for the mammalian NEI is present in amphibians and reptiles (Groups 10\u201314), while several a.a. are absent from Group 6 species and missing completely from Group 7 and 8 species (Figure 4). These data suggest that NEI has no biological function in teleosts. Similarly, in birds (Group 15), the predicted NEI peptide is highly modified, and the loss of the K/R R site for cleavage in chicken and Japanese quail (Figure 4) suggests that the peptide is not processed and released. Thus, NEI is conserved in land organisms, but not aquatic organisms or birds. Interestingly, a arginine\u2010valine (NEV) neuropeptide from the rainbow trout sequence was suggested as a homologue of the mammalian NEI, based mainly on the topological position and the presence of a dibasic RR motif (Baker et al., 1995; Nahon et al., 1989). Our analysis shows that NEV is predicted to be processed from PMCHL but not PMCH, and in species from Groups 6 and 7, but not Group 8 (Figure 4). An additional putative peptide, named MCH gene\u2010related peptide (Mgrp) (Figure 4), is present in Nile tilapia, but does not participate in background adaptation (Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, & Wendelaar Bonga, 1995c). The alignment of the various PMCHL shows an Mgrp putative sequence only in Group 8 species, where Nile tilapia sits (Figure 4), supporting the idea that taxonomic grouping of fish reflects evolutionary lineage. Of note, mass spectrometry shows Mgrp is present in the pituitary of Group 8 medaka (Oryzias latipes) (Suehiro et al., 2009), but not in flounders (Verasper moseri and Astatotilapia burtoni), although PMCH, PMCHL, MCH/L peptides are all present (Hu et al., 2016; Takahashi et al., 2004).",

ACTH and \u03b1\u2010MSH arise from processing of POMC in the anterior pituitary and pars intermedia pituitary, respectively, and are utilized in distinct neuroendocrine circuits (Zhou, Bloomquist, & Mains, 1993) (Figure 6a). \u03b2\u2010, \u03b3\u2010 and \u03b4\u2010MSH are also processed from POMC, but have no known role in background adaptation (Gilham & Baker, 1984; Sumpter & Lowry, 1984). For Group 1 cyclostomes, we analysed the peptides that would arise from two genes with homology to pomc, pom (pro\u2010opiomelanotropin) and poc (pro\u2010opiocortin), which contain the ACTH and the \u03b1\u2010MSH sequences, respectively (Heinig, Keeley, Robson, Sower, & Youson, 1995; Takahashi et al., 1995).

In agreement with previous studies (Dores & Baron, 2011; Kitahara et al., 1988), we found \u03b3\u2010MSH is also absent from Groups 6, 7 and 8. Novel is that \u03b3\u2010MSH in Squamata is missing in the lineage giving rise to snakes (4/4 species), but is present in lineages from which lizards and geckos arose (4/4 species) (Figure 6a and Table S4).

First, while the \u03b1\u2010MSH peptide predicted from the POM gene is identical to the MSH\u2010B peptide isolated from the pituitary glands of the Sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus (Takahashi et al., 1995), it is longer than gnathostome \u03b1\u2010MSH, with additional a.a. located near two amino terminal basic a.a. essential for endopeptidase cleavage (Figure 6b). Second, the homology in the region surrounding HFRW is low in agnathans (62%; 8/13 a.a. as compared to more than 92% in gnathostomes) (Figure 6b). Finally, the affinity of \u03b1\u2010MSH to the lamprey Mcr1 is 1,300 times lower than to the human receptor (Haitina et al., 2007; Schi\u00f6th, Petersson, Muceniece, Szardenings, & Wikberg, 1997). The fact that \u03b1\u2010MSH and ACTH bind to the lamprey receptor with similar affinities, while the affinity of \u03b1\u2010MSH for the human MCR1 is 20 times higher than that of ACTH (Haitina et al., 2007; Schi\u00f6th et al., 1997), suggests that ACTH may be the biological and the \u201cancestral\u201d ligand for the Mcr1 in agnathans. Interestingly, the localization of \u03b1\u2010MSH and ACTH to the intermedia and anterior pituitary, respectively, is nonetheless conserved between agnathans and gnathostomes (Nozaki, Takahashi, Amemiya, Kawauchi, & Sower, 1995), as is the tetrapeptide HFRW required to bind Mcr1 (Figure 6b) (Costa et al., 2004; Schwyzer, 1977).",

The literature supports the idea that this pigmentation response associates with the conservation of \u03b1\u2010MSH sequence between these groups. Particularly relevant in this regard, given their evolutionary separation from mammals, are Group 2 species, which also lack MCHL. The dogfish Squalus acanthias \u03b1\u2010MSH (Figure 6b) (Lowry, Bennett, & McMartin, 1974) is almost identical to that of human (identity 12/13 a.a; Figure 6b). Interestingly, in sharks, background adaptation is reversed by intravenous administration of \u03b1\u2010MSH antibodies (Rodrigues & Sumpter, 1984), and the marine elasmobranch and mammalian \u03b1\u2010MSH both induce melanosome dispersion after intravenous injection (Sumpter & Lowry, 1984). Indeed, \u03b1\u2010MSH regulates pigmentation in species from Groups 2 (Potamotrygon reticulatus) (Visconti & de L. Castrucci, 1993) to Group 16 (Abdel\u2010Malek et al., 1995), suggesting a conserved role (supporting references in Table S1).",

In birds, \u03b1\u2010MSH is likely produced in a paracrine manner in the integument, and not from the pars intermedia pituitary, which birds lack (Boswell & Takeuchi, 2005). In mammals, \u03b1\u2010MSH levels change seasonally, rising during spring/summer and decreasing in autumn/winter (Altmeyer, St\u00f6hr, & Holzmann, 1986; Lincoln & Baker, 1995; McFarlane et al., 2011), but the mechanisms and the source of \u03b1\u2010MSH are unknown. A possible explanation for the differences with Groups 10\u201314 is that species therein require rapid colour plasticity for thermoregulation (Fan, Stuart\u2010Fox, & Cadena, 2014; Tattersall, Eterovick, & Andrade, 2006), a need minimized in birds and mammals with an \u201cinsulated\u201d integument.",

            "text": "We used both the structure and presence of pomc, pmch and pmchl as a \u201cgenetic basis,\u201d alongside MCH/MCHL \u201chormonal status,\u201d to explain differences in the physiological mechanisms for background adaptation over evolution. The genetic basis includes a conserved \u03b1\u2010MSH sequence and function between Groups 2 and 16, but not Group 1 (Figure 7). A conserved three\u2010exon pmch gene, whose function appears conserved and relates to feeding behaviours and energy homoeostasis, is present in species of all 16 Groups. A pmchl gene appears in teleosts (Groups 6\u20138) and associates with hormonal status for MCHL (Figure 7) and axon projections from pmchl+, but not pmch+, neurons to the hypophysis. Therefore, we suggest MCHL arose evolutionarily in the Teleostei lineage, acquiring hormonal status and a new role in skin pigmentation. Finally, the \u201cgenetic basis\u201d and the \u201chormonal status\u201d together explain the following differences in the mechanisms that regulate background adaptation in vertebrates (Figure 7; conclusions):\nGroup 1: No significant role for \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH. The absence of a background adaptation response in cyclostomes likely reflects the inability of MCH and \u03b1\u2010MSH to regulate skin pigment dispersion or aggregation, with a distinct \u03b1\u2010MSH sequence and affinity to Mcr1 from that in gnathostomes. Lamprey skin does not respond to synthetic salmon MCHL (Baker & Bird, 2002), and a \u201cmelanophore\u2010aggregating factor\u201d is detected in hypothalamic but not pituitary extracts (Baker & Rance, 1983), suggesting that MCH does not possess hormonal status. Additionally, MCHL is not present in cyclostomes (Figure 7).Groups 2\u20134: \u03b1\u2010MSH but not MCH regulates background adaptation. MCHL is not detected in these groups, and MCH does not appear to have hormonal status. For instance, a shark MCH antibody detects cells in the hypothalamus, but not the pituitary gland, of Sphyrna lewini (Group 2) (Mizusawa et al., 2012). Additionally, neither human MCH (95% identity to shark MCH; 18/19 a.a.), nor synthetic MCHL, produce aggregation in Triakis scyllium and Potamotrygon reticulatus (Group 2) (Mizusawa et al., 2012; Visconti & de L. Castrucci, 1993). Yet, pituitary\u2010derived \u03b1\u2010MSH regulates background adaptation in several shark species (Visconti & de L. Castrucci, 1993) (Figure 7; supporting references in Table S1). Interestingly, skin melanophores from Erpetoichthys calabaricus (Group 3), and Acipenser stellate and Polyodon spathula (Group 4), do not respond to synthetic MCH and MCHL, and MCH antibodies fail to label fibres in the posterior pituitary (Baker & Bird, 2002; Sherbrooke & Hadley, 1988), arguing against hormonal status for MCH in Groups 3 and 4. Background adaptation in species from these groups, however, requires a functional pituitary and involves \u03b1\u2010MSH\u2010induced dispersion of melanosomes, pointing to \u03b1\u2010MSH, but not MCH, as the key regulator of skin pigmentation (Figure 7 and additional references in Table S1).Group 5: Hormonal status and skin response to MCH appears. In holosteans, MCH+ fibres extend to the pituitary in Lepisosteus osseus and Amia calva, and MCHL causes melanosome aggregation (Baker & Bird, 2002; Sherbrooke & Hadley, 1988). Therefore, a dual hormonal role of \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH in regulating skin pigmentation is possible. Whether MCHL is responsible is unclear, in that we were unable to find pcmhl in any holostean genome, including that of the fully sequenced Lepisosteus oculatus (Figure 7). Thus, it is possible that the dual\u2010hormonal system was present in the common ancestor of holosteans and teleosts. A key question that needs to be addressed is what selective advantage, if any, was provided by the duplicated genes of teleosts? Evolutionary selection of pmchl may be explained as a case of subfunctionalization, with essentially no functional change before and after the duplication in holosteans.Groups 6\u20138: A dual control mechanism at the bottom of the Teleostei lineage (Groups 6 and 7), and a single main regulator, likely MCHL, at the top (Group 8). We suggest pcmhl appears early in the teleost lineage by retroposition or during the TSD, with MCHL\u2010expressing neurons then selected over evolution to extend their axons to the pituitary. In this manner, function was split between neurotransmitter (MCH) and hormonal (MCHL) roles. In support of the dual control theory in Groups 6 and 7, physiological changes in both \u03b1\u2010MSH (black background) and MCHL (white background) are produced when background is altered. For example, in the eel (Group 7), MCH induces melanosome aggregation, and a salmon MCHL antibody labels secretory granules in neurons with fibres that terminate on neurohypophysial blood vessels, whose density varies between white and black adapted organisms (Gilham & Baker, 1984; Powell & Baker, 1988). Plasma \u03b1\u2010MSH levels increase in eels with a black background (Baker et al., 1984). In zebrafish, in addition to the hormonal status for MCHL suggested by our expression analysis (Figure 2), a white background increases pmchl mRNA levels, while fasting increases the expression of pmch (Berman et al., 2009). A black background in zebrafish triggers melanosome dispersion via \u03b1\u2010MSH interaction with Mcr1 expressed by melanophores (Richardson et al., 2008). In two Group 8 species, Starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus (Kang & Kim, 2013)) and Barfin flounder (Verasper moseri (Mizusawa et al., 2015)), pmch and pmchl mRNAs increase in white background\u2010adapted organisms, although most robustly for pmchl. Because MCHL, but not pomc mRNA/\u03b1\u2010MSH, levels change with background in several Group 8 species at the top of the Teleostei lineage, it is possible that during evolution the balance between \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH changed from \u03b1\u2010MSH\u00bbMCH in Groups 2\u20134, to a dual mechanism in Groups 6 and 7 (\u03b1\u2010MSH = MCH2), to \u03b1\u2010MSH\u00abMCHL in Group 8 species (Figure 7).Group 9: \u03b1\u2010MSH but not MCH regulates background adaptation. MCH+ nerve fibres are absent from the neural lobe of the pituitary of Protopterus annectens, and synthetic salmonid MCHL does not influence skin cells of Lepidosiren paradoxa (Dipnoi) (Baker, 1991; Visconti & de L. Castrucci, 1993), suggesting that MCH does not have hormonal status and plays no role in skin pigmentation (Figure 7).Groups 10\u201314: A uni\u2010humoral \u03b1\u2010MSH control system for background adaptation and thermoregulation. MCHL is not present in amphibians and reptiles, and MCH appears to lack hormonal status (Figure 7). Indeed, while the hypothalamus contains MCH\u2010expressing cells in frogs (Rana esculenta; Group 10), Squamata (Podarcis muralis and Natrix natrix; Group 12) and turtles (Trachemys scripta; Group 13), their axons do not project to the posterior pituitary (Cardot et al., 1994; L\u00e1z\u00e1r et al., 2002). Thus, \u03b1\u2010MSH is the main regulator of background adaptation and may also be important for temperature regulation of ectotherms though colour plasticity (Fernandez & Bagnara, 1991).Groups 15 and 16: New roles for \u03b1\u2010MSH and MCH. In birds and mammals, MCHL does not exist, MCH+ cells do not extend axons to the pituitary (Cardot et al., 1999; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2014), and the pars intermedia pituitary disappears in birds, arguing against a hormonal status for MCH (Figure 7). Birds rely on carotenoid ingestion for background adaptation, while in mammals \u03b1\u2010MSH possibly associates with seasonal colour moulting. Thus, while colour plasticity is important for thermoregulation in ectotherms, in feather/hair covered homoeotherms, skin pigment cells changed with regard to cell type (only melanocytes in birds and mammals), pigment type (eumelanin and pheomelanin) and properties (pigment secretion vs. dispersion/aggregation).\n",

In amphibians (possibly in Tetrapoda), a uni\u2010hormonal mechanism regulates background adaptation. With a black background, pomc mRNA levels increase in the pars intermedia (PI) pituitary, and the prehormone is processed to ACTH and then to \u03b1\u2010MSH. Plasma levels of \u03b1\u2010MSH increase and induce melanosome dispersion (secretion in mammals and birds) to darken the skin. With a white background, superchiasmatic melanotrope inhibitory neurons (SMIN) are active and repress pituitary melanotropes to decrease the levels of \u03b1\u2010MSH. SMIN neurons are described only in amphibians (reviewed by Bertolesi & McFarlane, 2018). An additional mechanism exists in certain fish, in that adaptation to a white background increases the expression of PMCH/PMCHL in brain neurons (dual\u2010hormonal mechanism). Two genes exist in fish, a three\u2010exon (pmch) gene (grey rectangles) conserved in vertebrates and a single\u2010exon (pmchl) gene (single grey rectangle; teleost).

A teleost\u2010specific pmchl gene encodes MCHL, which acts as a hormone in background adaptation, while the conserved pmch gene encodes MCH, which we suggest acts as a neurotransmitter to regulate energy homoeostasis and food intake.
