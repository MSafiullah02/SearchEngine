The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day 0 by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (\"susceptible-infective\") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large N limit for the state of the system on day t in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including \"removed\" (R) and \"exposed\" (E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.",

Alternatively, sequences of IRGs parametrized by increasing N have an important property called locally tree-like (LT). As described by Aldous and Steele (2004) and others, this property means that the random graph sequence is \"locally weakly convergent\" as N \u2192 \u221e to a connected Galton-Watson random tree, leading to a host of simplifications that are described by percolation theory on random graphs. The LT property of IRGs implies for example that for any k > 1, the density of cycles of length k in the graph goes to zero as N goes to infinity. The heuristic large N cascade arguments at the core of this paper are related to rigorous results in the literature surveyed by van der Hofstad (2016) that connect percolation properties on random graphs to properties of Galton-Watson processes.",

It then focusses on the recursive characterization of the stochastic infection cascade mapping in the N = \u221e limit. Section 4 discusses how the network approach to epidemiology fits in with two other approaches to infectious disease modelling: SI compartment models and agent based models. Section 5 explores how the basic SI network model can easily be extended to analogues of the SIR and SEIR compartment models. Section 6 provides a numerical implementation of the SI model, showing the flop count for computing a daily update to be O(M 2 \u00d7 Nfft) where M is the number of types and Nfft is the number of lattice points in each one-dimensional integration. Section 7 addresses the issue of calibrating ISRN models to real health and social data. In Section 8, we explore a simple illustration of how the method can be used to understand potential policy interventions to protect the residents of a seniors' centre while a pandemic rages in the community outside. Finally, a concluding section discusses some possible next steps for having a better understanding of contagion risk in inhomogeneous random social networks.",

We also consider the same IRSN specification scaled up by a multiplier N = kN 0 . In anticipation of an oncoming contagion, the workers have been trained to high standards of hygiene and care and the residents (who are elderly but healthy) have been instructed in social-distancing and hygiene. The townspeople (\"outsiders\", with type T = 3) on the other hand have only average ability to social distance, and so the contagion hits the town before the centre.
