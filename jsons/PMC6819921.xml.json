While these bacteria are considered to serve a protective role, recent studies that indicate enteric viruses exploit bacterial envelope components to facilitate infection (3). Poliovirus was found to bind both lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG) to enhance its thermostability and receptor affinity, facilitating in vivo infection (3). Antibiotic depletion of commensal bacteria inhibited oral poliovirus infection, but was rescued by recolonization, pretreatment of virus with LPS, or bypassing the enteric system through intraperitoneal injection (3). Other viruses, including reovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus, and murine norovirus, have been shown to use similar mechanisms to facilitate infection (3, 4). Together, these results indicate a key role for commensal bacteria in improving infectivity and pathogenesis of enteric viruses.",

Like the enteric version, the respiratory microbiome plays a protective role in immunity (1).

Given the high levels of commensals in the respiratory tract (1), it is possible that such interactions may have been maintained during emergence of CoV strains. Thus, we wondered if CoVs utilized bacterial components to facilitate infection. Previous work had identified a key role for the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways in immunity to SARS-CoV, with the absence of LPS binding TLR4 or its downstream adaptors resulting in augmented disease (7\u20139). Given the interactions observed between enteric viruses and bacterial components, CoVs may also use similar microbial components to improve infectivity and subsequently stimulate the TLR4 response.",

Using mass spectrometry, we identified a cyclic lipopeptide (CLP), surfactin, as the molecule responsible for CoV inhibition. The inhibitory effect of surfactin was dose and temperature dependent, with treatment disrupting the integrity of the CoV particle. Notably, surfactin treatment of the inoculum ablated CoV infection in vivo, but prophylactic treatment had no effect. Other similar CLPs had no effect on CoV infectivity, suggesting that the viricidal properties of surfactin were unique. Importantly, surfactin treatment reduced the infectivity of several other enveloped viruses, including that of influenza A, Zika, Dugbe, Nipah, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya, Mayaro, Una, and Ebola viruses. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of surfactin as a viricidal compound and highlight the potential for microbial environment to modulate virus infection.",

In contrast to its effect on enteric viruses, LPS had no effect on CoV infectivity; however, the presence of PG from B. subtilis dramatically reduced the infectivity of both HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1B). The structure of PG varies considerably between bacterial species (11), suggesting that PG from different bacteria may have distinct effects on CoV infectivity. To explore this, we tested a diverse set of bacterially derived PGs for the ability to modulate CoV infection (Fig. 1C). Notably, only PG derived from B. subtilis reduced HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that interference with CoV infectivity is not shared by PG from all bacterial species.",

Interestingly, PG disruption of viral infectivity was reduced at lower temperatures. For HCoV-229E, infectivity had a stepwise reduction with increasing temperature (Fig. 1D). In contrast, PG reduction of MERS-CoV infectivity was ablated at lower temperatures, with no significant loss of viral infectivity at either RT or 32\u00b0C (Fig. 1E). Together, these data indicate that the inhibitory effect of B. subtilis PG is influenced by incubation temperature.",

To differentiate these possibilities, we exploited the poor solubility of PG, washing it in a variety of solvents to separate its inhibitory effect (Fig. 2A). After three washes in PBS, PG maintained its reduction of HCoV-229E infectivity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PG washed with either 100% ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) lost the ability to inhibit HCoV-229E infectivity (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the washes either modified the inhibitory capacity of PG or removed a soluble compound responsible for reducing CoV infectivity. To explore this, the supernatants from clarified PG samples were incubated with HCoV-229E (Fig. 2B). While the PBS, PBS control, and ethanol control had no inhibitory effect, the ethanol supernatant from PG potently reduced viral infectivity of HCoV-229E (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that a soluble compound distinct from, but present in, the PG sample is responsible for reducing CoV infectivity.",

While all of these peaks were present in the ethanol supernatant, the compound with a mass of 1,058.7 was enriched nearly 10-fold (Fig. 2D). Further analysis of this peak by fragmentation produced a spectrum matching that of the cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (12), a potent biosurfactant produced naturally by B. subtilis and shown previously to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties (13, 14) (Fig. 2E; for structure, see Fig. 6A).

HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV were treated with PBS or surfactin at either RT, 32\u00b0C, or 37\u00b0C. For all three CoVs, surfactin reduced infectivity after treatment at 37\u00b0C, with a nearly complete loss of infectious virus (Fig. 3A to C). Similarly to B. subtilis PG (Fig. 1D and E), the degree of reduction varied based on incubation temperature and varied between the CoVs (Fig. 3A to C). To further characterize the kinetics of inhibition, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV were treated with surfactin at 4\u00b0C, RT, 32\u00b0C, or 37\u00b0C, and sampled to measure time-dependent neutralization (Fig. 3D and E). At both 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, surfactin rapidly reduced HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, with a nearly complete loss of infectivity after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 3D and E). In contrast, RT incubation reduced CoV infectivity more slowly, and the effects of surfactin were ablated at 4\u00b0C. We also observed dose-dependent changes in surfactin activity against HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, higher concentrations of surfactin were required for inhibition of HCoV-229E compared to that for inhibition of either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, whose inhibition curves were nearly identical. Together, these data indicate that both temperature and dose impact the inhibitory effects of surfactin.",

DPP4 levels were assayed by flow cytometry in HUH7 cells, a line known to be permissive to MERS-CoV infection. Briefly, HUH7 cells were treated with surfactin. Cells were then incubated with a recombinant MERS-S1-Fc, stained with an anti-Fc-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) secondary antibody, and total FITC staining was measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). Surfactin- and PBS-treated cells had nearly identical fluorescent intensities, suggesting that surfactin treatment has no effect on DPP4 levels. Similarly, Western blot analysis of treated stock virus demonstrated that surfactin treatment had no effect on MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein protein concentrations (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggested that both the host receptor and the viral spike glycoprotein were not disturbed by surfactin treatment.",

Therefore, we examined if virion integrity was maintained by performing RNase I protection assays. Following surfactin treatment, particles were exposed to RNase I to digest exposed viral RNA; samples were subsequently extracted for RNA, and relative viral RNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Increasing surfactin concentrations correlated with a decrease in viral RNA and viral titer for both HCoV-229E (Fig. 4C) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4D), despite having no effect on MERS-CoV spike protein levels (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that disruption of virion integrity is the primary mechanism by which surfactin inhibits CoV infection. To confirm these results, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on HCoV-229E treated with 10, 15, 20, and 100 \u03bcg/ml surfactin or PBS. In control-treated samples, numerous intact HCoV-229E particles could be visualized (Fig. 4E to G). As surfactin concentration increased, fewer virions were observed by TEM, with few intact virions being observed in 20 \u03bcg/ml and none in 100 \u03bcg/ml surfactin-treated samples (Fig. 4F). Notably, numerous round, deflated structures of similar diameter as the HCoV-229E virions could be found in the 15- and 20-\u03bcg/ml samples, which may represent disrupted virions (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that surfactin inhibits CoV infection primarily through the disruption of viral particles.",

Numerous in vivo studies have demonstrated that surfactin is tolerated at higher concentrations than in vitro cytotoxicity experiments with erythrocytes would suggest (19, 20). Additionally, our own in vitro cytotoxicity experiments have demonstrated that other cell lines tolerate surfactin at higher levels than those tolerated by erythrocytes. Together, this suggests that surfactin may have therapeutic potential. Therefore, we wanted to examine the potential of surfactin to treat infections in vivo. We reasoned that virions must interact with the respiratory microbiome upon release and transmission. To model this interaction, we tested whether direct treatment of the inoculum reduced in vivo infection and disease. SARS-CoV (104 PFU) was treated with PBS or surfactin and used to infect BALB/c mice intranasally (i.n.). Mice were monitored over 4 days for weight loss and lethality, with lung titers determined at 2 and 4 days postinfection. As expected, animals infected with PBS-treated virus experienced rapid weight loss and exhibited high lung titers at both 2 and 4 days postinfection (Fig. 5A). In contrast, mice infected with surfactin-treated SARS-CoV lost no weight, and no infectious virus was detected in their lungs (Fig. 5B). Additionally, mock-infected mice receiving surfactin alone demonstrated no signs of disease or weight loss, suggesting that surfactin treatment alone does not have any pathological effects (Fig. 5A).",

As a negative control, we tested the nonenveloped coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Each virus was treated with either PBS or surfactin, and viral infectivity was determined. As expected, surfactin had no effect on the nonenveloped CVB3 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, surfactin significantly reduced infectivity in each of the enveloped viruses (Fig. 6C), but the magnitude of effect was not uniform. Most enveloped viruses were reduced either to below their limit of detection or more than 100,000-fold. In contrast, Mayaro virus, both influenza strains, and EBOV exhibited some resistance, having their infectious titer reduced by only 2.6, 2.7, 2.4, and 1.6 logs, respectively. These data suggest that while surfactin treatment broadly reduced the infectivity of enveloped viruses, factors beyond the mere presence or absence of an envelope may govern overall sensitivity.",

Unfortunately, despite efficacy against the inoculum, prophylactic surfactin treatment prior to infection had no effect on CoV-related disease in vivo. Notably, other CLPs had no effect on CoV infectivity despite having similar biochemical structures. Finally, we found that surfactin treatment was efficacious against many enveloped viruses in vitro, including influenza A virus (IAV) strains H1N1 and H3N2, ZIKV, DUGV, NiV, CCHFV, CHIKV, Una virus, Mayaro virus, and EBOV.

            "text": "Over the last two decades, surfactin has been shown to be antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral (13, 14, 19, 21, 22). Mechanistically, the broad antimicrobial efficacy of surfactin has been linked to disruption of lipid membranes (15). However, more recently, researchers describing the efficacy of surfactin against the animal CoV porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) suggested that surfactin inhibited viral-host membrane fusion (19). Concentration of surfactin may explain the distinct mechanisms. In our studies, a higher surfactin dose (100 \u03bcg/ml) corresponded to virion destruction and a >10,000-fold reduction in CoV infectivity (Fig. 4C and D). In contrast, the PEDV study used a lower surfactin concentration (20 \u03bcg/ml), which corresponded to fusion inhibition based on intact particles and membrane integration assays (19). However, they reported only limited changes in viral load based on percent reduction in PFU. Our examination at the lower surfactin dose (20 \u03bcg/ml) found intermediate results with less reduction in CoV infectivity (10-fold reduction) but also a corresponding loss of viral RNA following RNase I treatment (Fig. 4C and D). TEM at this dose indicated the presence of both intact and disrupted virions. Together, the results suggest that virion structure may be maintained at this lower concentration but that virion integrity has been compromised in a subset of particles. Notably, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for surfactin varies within the human respiratory CoVs, with HCoV-229E (32.5 \u03bcg/ml) requiring a higher dose than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (18.9 and 16.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively). This fact suggests that PEDV, an enteric CoV, may have increased resistance to surfactin-like molecules due to posttranslational modifications, including lipid composition or glycosylation state, possibly contributing to differences in mechanistic findings.",

While surfactin ablates SARS-CoV disease when treating the inoculum, prophylactic treatment was not protective. The failure of surfactin to protect mice against SARS-CoV is puzzling, given the efficacy of prophylactic oral surfactin treatment against PEDV disease (19). One explanation is that intranasal (i.n.) surfactin administration is not efficient in delivery to the lower respiratory tract. Branching of the airway may result in uneven distribution of surfactin, and prior studies have shown that intranasal instillation achieves only 50% efficiency at delivery to the lower respiratory tract (23, 24). In contrast, oral administration efficiently delivers compounds to the gastrointestinal system and is especially effective for lipopeptides, which persist within the intestines (25, 26). Dosing may also play an important role in distinguishing the differences in disease outcome, with oral treatment of the gut permitting a much higher dose (20 mg/kg every 3 hours) than intranasal delivery (0.5 mg/kg 2 times a day) (19). To overcome these problems, futures studies should use higher doses or more effective delivery methods, such as intubation or the inhalation of an aerosolized surfactin. Alternatively, several surfactin derivatives exist that enhance its viricidal activity and decrease its hemolytic activity (13, 14, 27). Using a derivative with higher activity and specificity may compensate for inefficient delivery or dose restriction. It is also possible that tissue-specific differences between respiratory tract and gut may limit access of surfactin to free virions. However, without further manipulation and understanding, surfactin is not yet a tangible target for therapeutic treatments of respiratory CoV infection.",

While all tested enveloped viruses were sensitive to surfactin treatment, IAV strains H1N1 and H3N2, Mayaro virus, and EBOV demonstrated a degree of resistance. These data suggest that factors beyond the mere presence of a viral envelope regulate surfactin efficacy. One possible factor is the lipid content of the viral envelope. Previous studies have shown that membranes enriched in cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) are resistant to surfactin permeabilization, while membranes containing phosphatidylcholines (PC) are more sensitive (28). The envelope of influenza A viruses have been reported to be enriched for both cholesterol and PE (29), providing support for this hypothesis. Unfortunately, the lipid content of the other viruses tested have not been determined, preventing direct comparison. Nevertheless, some broad observations are worth mentioning. CoVs, ZIKV, and bunyaviruses (CCHFV and DUGV) derive their envelopes from either the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum, organelles enriched in surfactin-sensitive PC (30). NiV (31), IAV (32), and EBOV (33) are thought to derive their envelopes from lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, which could specify their lipid content and thus surfactin sensitivity. Alphaviruses such as CHIKV, Mayaro, and Una also bud from the plasma membrane, although neither the lipid content nor the involvement of lipid rafts has been explored (34). Together, these observations suggest that the lipid content of enveloped viruses may explain their differential sensitivity to surfactin.",

In particular, iturin A is biochemically similar to surfactin and has also been reported to disrupt lipid membranes (Fig. 6A) (13). A possible explanation involves differences in their mechanisms of action. Surfactin penetrates lipid layers, alone solubilizing and permeabilizing them (15). In contrast, iturin A must interact with sterol components to cause membrane permeabilization, explaining its broad antifungal activity but only selective antibacterial activity (13). However, iturin A is also quite hemolytic (13, 14), making it unclear why the membranes of enveloped viruses grown in mammalian cells would not also be susceptible to this mechanism due to the presence of sterols. Compounding this mechanistic uncertainty, daptomycin\u2019s permeabilization of membranes requires no such interaction, but CoVs are resistant to its effects as well (35) (Fig. 6B). The results argue that surfactin possesses unique properties that confer its viricidal activity.",

Molecular dynamics simulation suggest that temperature governs both the 3-dimensional \u201chorse saddle\u201d structure of individual surfactin molecules and shape of surfactin micelles (36). Thus, one explanation for the temperature-sensitive viricidal activity of surfactin is that the specific structural conformations necessary to disrupt virion integrity only occur at higher temperatures. Alternatively, temperature could modulate the specific structure of the CoV virus itself. Virions are dynamic structures that undergo \u201cviral breathing,\u201d whereby they undergo large structural fluctuations that are often required for infection (37). Importantly, viral breathing can be enhanced by incubation at higher temperatures (37). While viral breathing has not been examined in the context of CoVs, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer fluctuates between lying and standing positions, demonstrating the flexibility of CoV structural proteins (38). Thus, it is possible that, at lower temperatures, CoVs adopt a conformation that sterically hinders surfactin from accessing the viral membrane, preventing disruption. Future studies are necessary to differentiate between these possibilities in order to fully understand the implications of the temperature dependent effects of surfactin.",

Studies with poliovirus demonstrated that the presence of commensal bacteria is necessary for oral poliovirus infection in mice (40). Similar findings with other enteric viruses suggest that utilizing bacterial components is a common approach. In contrast, our results add further complexity, demonstrating that surfactin, a secondary metabolite of B. subtilis, can potently reduce CoV infectivity. Although B. subtilis is not generally part of the human microbiome (41), it is often used as an intestinal probiotic and has been found to transiently persist in the gut (42). Additionally, surfactin-like molecules are produced by a broad array of bacterial species (13, 43\u201345). For example, the novel surfactin-like CLP coryxin was recently found to be produced by Corynebacterium xerosis, a common member of the respiratory microbiome (45). These facts suggest that microbial components typically thought to work against bacterial competitors could also potentially disrupt viral infection. Thus, as the relationship between the microbiome and viral infections is further explored, the role that bacterial metabolites such as surfactin and other CLPs play in modulating infection must be considered in viral disease. Overall, these results highlight the dynamic microbial environment and its potential to impact viral pathogenesis, as well as for identifying novel inhibitory factors for therapeutic use.",
