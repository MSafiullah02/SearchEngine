            "text": "In December 2019, the first pneumonia case of unknown etiological origins was reported in Wuhan city, China, and then, a series of similar cases emerged with the clinical symptoms of viral pneumonia. 1 Subsequently, high-throughput sequencing confirmed a novel coronavirus to be the causative pathogen, which is currently named 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). 2 Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 3\u22126 and MERS-CoV in 2012, 7 have infected humans several times and led to serious consequences in the past. Similarly, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19. Because of the severe human-to-human transmission, the disease quickly spread all around China and almost the whole world and has become a globe public health emergency, as declared by the WHO. 8 Although COVID-19 could cause severe lung damage and lead to patient's death, this disease also has many common clinical manifestations including fever, cough, myalgia, short-ness of breath, and fatigue, and these symptoms are usually associated with other respiratory infections. 9 According to the guideline for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the predominant and standard method for laboratory diagnosis. 10 However, this method could not overcome some non-negligible drawbacks, including the long nucleic acid extraction procedure and nonsuitability for on-site detection. Also, false-negative results were unavoidable because of many factors, such as unstable reagents, low viral load in the sample, and improper sampling techniques. 11\u221214 More importantly, as a sophisticated detection method, RT-PCR relies more on operators' experiences and complex equipments, and the relative reagents need a cold chain support for both transportation and storage. All these factors will delay the detection efficiency. Hence, it is urgently needed to establish a rapid and easily performed method to facilitate the on-site diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Furthermore, AuNPs exhibit excellent biocompatibility and little biological toxicity, 31\u221233 which is a great advantage in in vitro and in vivo diagnosis. Therefore, the POCT strip based on AuNP-LF assay is efficient for rapid onsite and low-cost detection because it gives easily observable positive or negative results. Until now, the AuNP-LF assay has been widely used to detect various analytes including infectious virus, proteins, drugs, and other pathogens. 34\u221237 In this article, a rapid detection method for the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using the SARS-CoV-2 NP prepared by our group as the capture antigen, was designed and developed. This Au NP-LF assay combines the merits of the immune lateral-flow system and unique properties of AuNPs and is easily operated and cost-effective in large-scale detection. Especially, the whole test process lasts for less than 15 min to obtain results and requires only 10\u221220 \u03bcL serum. We discussed several factors in the preparation of colloidal gold immune conjugates and the manufacture of AuNP-LF strips. The sensitivity, specificity, and stability were evaluated by testing clinical positive and negative serum samples, with RT-PCR's test results as the control. Considering all the advantages of this newly developed AuNP-LF assay, it is possible for it to become an auxiliary diagnostic method for COVID-19 and has great potential in containing worldwide pandemic.",

UV\u2212vis absorption spectra of AuNPs are shown in Figure 1A , and the maximum ultraviolet absorption peak of AuNPs was located at 525 nm, which was coincident with the theoretical equation reported previously. 38 The obtained AuNPs have good distribution uniformity in the aqueous solution, which could be indicated from the narrow peak shape of UV\u2212vis absorption spectra. As shown in Figure 1B , the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showed that AuNPs were about 30 nm in diameter. AuNPs of this size were suitable for conjugating proteins as the previous literature described. 39 2.2. Optimization of AuNP\u2212(Anti-Human IgM) Conjugates. As we know, when the reaction system's pH value is close or a little higher than the isoelectric point of the antibody, the electrostatic and physical adsorption between AuNPs and antibodies are most stable. 40, 41 High concentration of salt will bring destructive effect into the reaction system. Figure S2A displayed that the reaction system's color under the optimal pH remained wine-red, while those under other pH changed to purple or even white. Hence, the optimal pH value was determined to be 8.0. Similarly, as shown in Figure S2B , 1.5 \u03bcg of anti-human IgM was sufficient to stabilize the conjugate. According to the previous literature, 42 1.8 \u03bcg of anti-human IgM, slightly more than the above-mentioned antibody amount, was selected as the optimal level.",

When the COVID-19 positive serum sample was tested, the color intensity of the T line was most significant with 1.2 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 NP, but the flatness of the T line was not as good as 1.0 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 NP. At lower concentrations, for example, 0.6 and 0.3 mg/mL, the red T line was difficult to be observed by naked eyes, so the optimal SARS-CoV-2 NP concentration was selected to be 1.0 mg/mL. Similarly, when normal persons' sera were tested, various concentrations of goat\u2212anti-mouse IgG (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mg/mL) coated on the control line (C line) resulted in different visual effects ( Figure 2B ).

Nevertheless, when detecting antibodies using the immunochromatography method, the hook effect could not be neglected. 43 The hook effect results from the coinstantaneous reaction of an excess target protein with both immobilized and labeled antibodies or antigens. In this designed AuNP-LF assay, a larger amount of sera did not mean certain better sensitivity. A suitable proportion of serum and sample treating buffer took a significant role in improving the performance of the AuNP-LF assay. Different results were shown in Table S1 . When 20 \u03bcL of the serum sample and 80 \u03bcL of treating buffer were mixed and tested, the result was much reliable than other conditions. For example, reducing serum to less than 10 \u03bcL might lead to incomplete absorption and result in misdetection. Conversely, excess serum had the chance to introduce a false positive phenomenon.",

The final purpose of the work was to establish a rapid and reliable method to detect the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in COVID-19 patients' serum directly by naked eyes. In order to evaluate AuNP-LF's practicality, serum samples from five patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by RT-PCR) were collected and tested using our prepared strips, while normal humans' serum samples were assessed as the control. As shown in Figure S3 and Table 1 , five RT-PCR-confirmed serum samples were all determined to be seropositive by AuNP-LF strips. Meanwhile, 13 out of 14 normal humans' sera were detected to be negative by our AuNP-LF assay, and only one sample was tested to be positive. Comprehensively analyzing the test results of the RT-PCR and AuNP-LF assay, our strips had a good consistency by the Kappa test (\u03ba coefficient = 0.872). The sensitivity and specificity of AuNP-LF were 100 and 93.3%, respectively, and the Youden index was 0.933. All the analysis indicators demonstrate that our designed unique AuNP-LF assay is suitable for rapid and onsite surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All the results described above indicated that our designed AuNP-LF assay should have great significance in detecting the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In comparison with other traditional methods, the AuNP-LF assay exhibits several advantages as follows. First, AuNPs, employed to generate a test signal in the immunological technique, were stable and hard to be deactivated. Second, the sample consumption for each test was only 10\u221220 \u03bcL, while the nucleic acid extraction process of the RT-PCR usually required more than 100 \u03bcL of the sample. In addition to less sample usage, the total test time could be controlled within 15 min, while other test methods usually needed several hours. Furthermore, our designed AuNP-LF assay is particularly easy to practise, and the operators only need a minimal training, which means that tests could be carried out in any place, including primary hospitals and remote regions, as these facilities are usually lack sophisticated detection equipment and professional technicians. Meanwhile, the materials involved in assembling AuNP-LF strips, including colloidal gold nanoparticles, have excellent biocompatibility and biosecurity. In addition, the AuNP-LF assay does not need any instrument, and all the reagents and materials used in preparing strips are at a very low cost. Moreover, the AuNP-LF assay could avoid collecting patients' respiratory tract specimen, so the healthcare workers' risk of getting infected could be significantly reduced.",

Compared with the primarily used RT-PCR method, the AuNP-LF assay exhibits several superiorities including quick test time, less sample consumption, simplicity of operation, dispensing with expensive instruments, independence of professional experience, and much lower cost of each test. Also, as a reliable immunological detection, this proposed AuNP-LF assay has favorable specificity and repeatability. We tested both positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 serum samples, the result of the AuNP-LF assay has a good consistency with that of RT-PCR. As research continues, the newly developed method should have great potential in large-scale and fast detection, especially for urgent conditions, and will surely become an important supplementary diagnosis method for COVID-19.",

            "text": "4.5. Conjugation of Antihuman IgM to AuNPs. Before preparing the AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) conjugate, the reaction condition including the pH value and antibody concentration, should be optimized. First, each centrifuge tube was filled with 200 \u03bcL of AuNP solution. The reaction system was adjusted to series of pH (6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0) . Then, the labeled antibody was added into the mixture followed by a 10 min incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, 45 \u03bcL of 10% NaCl was added into the reaction system, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. Finally, the mixture's color changing was observed. Analogously, the optimization of the labeled antibody was studied by adding different amounts of antihuman IgM (0, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 \u03bcg) into the reaction system. Under the optimal pH value and antibody amount, antihuman IgM was conjugated to the surface of AuNPs to form AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) bioconjugates. First, 1 mL of AuNP solution was adjusted to the optimal pH, and then, 9 \u03bcg of anti-human IgM was added into the mixture and stirred for 30 min. Next, 250 \u03bcL of 5% (w/v) BSA solution was added to the reaction system with another 30 min stirring for blocking. Afterward, the products were collected by a two-step centrifugation. First, the solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the impurity of large and inhomogenous particles were discarded. Second, the remained supernatant was centrifuged again at 13,200 rpm for another 10 min, and the sediment was kept. Finally, 500 \u03bcL of resuspension buffer [containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20, 2% (w/v) sucrose and 50 mM Tris] was used to resuspend the sediment products, and the AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) conjugates were obtained. 4.6. Development of AuNP-LF Strips. The AuNP-LF strip is composed of a sample pad (10 \u00d7 4 mm), a conjugate pad (8 \u00d7 4 mm), a nitrocellulose membrane (20 \u00d7 4 mm), and an absorbent pad (10 \u00d7 4 mm). All these components are attached to a PVC backing card. The schematic diagram of the test strip is presented in Scheme 1. AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) conjugates were immobilized on the conjugate pad, and then, the pad was dried at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The SARS-CoV-2 NP and goat antimouse IgG were dispensed on the nitrocellulose membrane at the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL for the T line and 2.0 mg/mL for the C line with the two lines' interval at 4 mm, and then, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked using 1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min and dried at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Finally, the prepared strip was assembled into a plastic shell and stored in a vacuum bag for future use. During the manufacture process, one piece of the nitrocellulose membrane could produce at least 75 strips, so each strip was very cost-effective. 4.7. AuNPs-LF Assay Procedures. For detection, serum and sample treating buffer [30 mM PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100] were mixed at the desired ratio of 1:4, and then, 100 \u03bcL of the mixture was added onto the sample port of the AuNP-LF strip; then, the liquid transferred toward the absorbent pad under the hydrodynamic force and capillary power. During the test procedure, IgM in serum could be captured by the AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) conjugate at the conjugate pad, and then, the AuNP\u2212(antihuman IgM)\u2212IgM compound flowed to the analytical membrane. The SARS-CoV-2 NP immobilized at the T line caught the target IgM against SARS-CoV-2 and form the AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM)\u2212(SARS-CoV-2 IgM)\u2212(SARS-CoV-2 NP) compound, while goat antimouse IgG immobilized at the C line directly caught AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM) and form the AuNP\u2212(anti-human IgM)\u2212(goat-anti mouse IgG) compound. The positive and negative results could be determined by the specific reddish-purple tracer of AuNPs. The red C line represents the strip's effectivity. If there was not a visible C line, whether a red T line appeared or not, the test result should be judged as invalid (Scheme 2). The detecting results could be easily judged by naked eyes within 15 min.",
