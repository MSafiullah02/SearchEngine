These findings were reproduced by exposure to SARS coronavirus spike protein in the absence of replicative virus. In a murine model of acute lung injury due to acid aspiration, SARS coronavirus spike protein exacerbated lung failure by down-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. SARS coronavirus Spike protein\u2013induced lung failure could be mitigated by inhibition with angiotensin II receptor type 1, the receptor that mediates angiotensin II\u2013induced vascular permeability and lung injury. In a separate publication, the same investigators demonstrated that recombinant ACE2 protects mice from acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury [1]. The investigators also note that ACE1 polymorphisms have been associated with progression of SARS [2].",
