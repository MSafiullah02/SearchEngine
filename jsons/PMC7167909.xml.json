The lack of correlation with the severity of acute bronchiolitis is surprising. The presence of low rates in an acute context leads us to imagine lower rates among the most severe cases. However, the results do not show any correlation with the severity of acute bronchiolitis as evaluated by the Wainwright score, which could also be surprising. Additionally, there was no correlation between sRAGE rates and severity as evaluated by morbidity data such as total hospital stay, type of hospital unit, the need for respiratory support, or respiratory support duration. These morbidity data are probably even more reliable than the Wainwright score since evaluated once at inclusion of cases. The low number of severe cases could be a bias in our study, and this seems true according to the distribution of our population established on the Wainwright score. However, when we observe the severity on hospitalization data, 25 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit, representing the real most severe cases of acute bronchiolitis.",

It could partly explain the lower sRAGE levels in the bronchiolitis group than in the control group here. On the other hand, it may be hypothesized that constitutive lower sRAGE levels predispose for acute bronchiolitis and severe episodes. But the results of this first observational study must be confirmed by larger and more multicentric populations before concluding a physiopathological model.

Indeed, a singular feature of sRAGE levels in infancy is broad variability with age due to pulmonary maturation and alveolarization processes that last up to 12\u201024 months.6, 22 sRAGE levels decrease progressively in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and serum from 30 weeks of amenorrhea to birth and again from birth to adulthood.23, 24 Our findings confirm this and are well described in Figure 2. Unfortunately, we did not obtain data in control infants under one month old, so our study may be underpowered to detect significant negative correlation between serum sRAGE and age in controls. This major variation factor of sRAGE levels could explain the discrepancies in the study results of Garc\u00eda\u2010Salido et al.16 Their study showed a pattern opposite from ours, that is, higher serum sRAGE levels in severe acute bronchiolitis than in controls. This different pattern seems likely due to control\u2010group factors, as Garc\u00eda\u2010Salido et al controls were older than the target population for acute bronchiolitis with an average age of 8 years (14 months to 18 years), which could skew comparisons between groups as physiological sRAGE levels are higher during the first months of life.23 Our control sample seems more precise, even though we had no controls aged under one month. To our knowledge, our study is the first to include healthy controls under 1 year of age, but there is no data available on sRAGE levels in this target population with which to compare our results.25\n",
