However, traditional culture methods are time consuming and have low rates of positive detection. With the development of molecular biology, the value of whole genome\u2013based next-generation sequencing (NGS) has gradually been recognized, especially for the detection of rare, atypical, or slow-growing microbes. NGS is mainly used in the clinical setting for assessment of sterile body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and joint effusion [1\u20133]. For non-sterile body fluids, such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the applications of NGS are quite limited. In addition to human genome interference and other common problems, the interpretation of NGS results (i.e. distinguishing colonization vs. infection) remains problematic. In recent years, the feasibility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the aetiological detection and identification of respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated [4]. In the current study, we summarized the mNGS results for 35 BALF samples from 32 patients and attempted to verify the value of mNGS in the diagnosis of severe respiratory diseases based on the interpretation of sequencing results.",

The limited value of mNGS may be because standardized anti-PC and anti-CMV treatments are typically applied immediately upon admission in our department. Furthermore, most patients admitted to the RICU have severe pneumonia, which is treated empirically for a wide range of pathogens. However, traditional methodologies combined with mNGS can better guide the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. High agreement rates between conventional methods and mNGS in our current study further verified the validity and accuracy of mNGS. For hospitals with limited detection capabilities, mNGS is recommended based on local epidemiological characteristics, especially for immunocompromised patients and those with severe or complicated infections.",

Two of our patients (no. 8 and no. 14) underwent BALF mNGS twice, and dynamic changes in the PC and adenovirus reads could indirectly reflect therapeutic effectiveness, which is a potential added value of this technique [17, 18]. Furthermore, mNGS can be used for adenovirus genotyping, thereby providing better clinical practice guidance. However, due to difficulties in virus culture and high false-positive rates of nucleic acid detection alone, few reports have described whether the detected DNA virus is a pathogenic microbe [18, 19]. The reads and rates of relative abundance determined by NGS may provide a quantitative basis for identification of viral infection; however, additional experiments are needed to verify the optimal cut-off values.",

The lower respiratory tract is a relatively sterile anatomical location; with prolonged onset time, the types of bacterial flora may change, which may be a result of bacterial flora migration. Loss of diversity within respiratory tract microbial communities is proposed as an ecological marker of infection [22, 23].",
