This large, multicentre, international cohort of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis allows for in depth assessment of the clinical factors associated with poor outcomes from COVID-19. Accepting that data from registries are subject to selection bias, preliminary findings suggest that baseline liver disease severity is strongly associated with COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, many SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cirrhosis experienced hepatic decompensation even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. These findings have important implications for clinicians regarding risk stratification and prognostication for patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 and suggest the need to maintain a low threshold for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the presence of new hepatic decompensation.
