The integration of co-stimulatory and -inhibitory signals during T cell receptor engagement determines the functional capacity of T cells during immunity and tolerance. Several co-inhibitory receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily such as programmed death (PD)-1 or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4 were initially identified as crucial for the establishment and maintenance of peripheral tolerance due to their suppression of self-reactive adaptive immune responses 3, 4. Co-inhibitory receptors were also assigned increasing relevance in the regulation of immune responses against altered self and foreign antigen. In cancer, various tumors exhibit high expression levels of co-inhibitory ligands which correlate with poor prognosis 5, 6. Tumor-infiltrating T cells express multiple co-inhibitory receptors that compromise tumor-specific T cell responses 7, 8. In infection, co-inhibitory pathways modulate T cell immunity against all major classes of pathogens, that is, viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and nematode parasites 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. However, the immunomodulatory function of co-inhibitory pathways has been most extensively investigated in the context of persistent virus infections where they contribute to the downregulation of antiviral effector functions 14, 15, 16.",

Despite the documented therapeutic potential of co-inhibitory pathway interference during various infectious diseases [17], distinct studies have reported adverse events or overall detrimental consequences when interfering with T cell co-inhibition (Table 1\n). In line with these reports, our own findings suggest a vital role of T cell co-inhibition in the protection from immune-mediated tissue damage during persistent virus infection [18]. Our results and those of others highlight the release of negative immunoregulation to bear considerable detrimental potential in the form of severe immunopathology.",

For example, programmed death ligand (PD-L)1 blockade prior to Listeria monocytogenes infection negatively affects antibacterial CD8 T cell responses [19]. The suppression is suggested to result from increased nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages after PD-L1 blockade [20]. As macrophage-derived NO is a hallmark of infections with intracellular bacteria, PD-L1 blockade might also compromise T cell responses against other intracellular bacteria. Accordingly, deficient PD-1\u2013PD-L1 signaling precipitates increased mortality after infection with the intracellular bacterium Salmonella typhimurium or Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n21, 22. Increased mortality is attributed to impaired T helper (Th)1 development in the former but to immunopathology due to excessive Th1 responses in the latter infection model. Despite this divergent impact of impaired co-inhibition, the immune responses elicited by these intracellular bacteria shared the protective function conferred by PD-1\u2013PD-L1 signaling.",

Of note, this consideration is only relevant for infections with noncytopathic viruses that leave infected host cells viable. Furthermore, strain-dependent variations in pathogen virulence also seem to impact the benefit of targeting co-inhibitory pathways [24]. Although CTLA-4 blockade during infections with strain Py17NL of Plasmodium yoelii results in improved parasite clearance devoid of overt immunopathology, treating mice infected with the more virulent strain Py-lethal leads to exacerbated inflammation and increased mortality.",

Moreover, CTLA-4 blockade is without effect if conducted from day 3 of P. yoelii (strain Py-lethal) infection, but starting treatment on day 0 post-infection significantly increases mortality [24]. Analogously, PD-L1 blockade from day 0 of L. monocytogenes infection compromises antibacterial T cell immunity, whereas a slight delay of treatment enhances antibacterial T cell function [19].

PD-L1 expression on oligodendroglia in the central nervous system (CNS) of demyelinating coronavirus-infected mice suppresses T cell effector functions and might offer protection from fatal axonal bystander damage [27]. Moreover, PD-L1 upregulation on fibroblast reticular cells dampens the destruction of the splenic architecture during persistent LCMV infection [28]. In the same infection model, PD-L1-deficiency on cells of nonhematopoietic origin elicits fatal immunopathology 6\u20137 days after infection [29].",

Hence, interrupting signaling through a specific receptor can manifest in enhanced effector functions in specific cell types, which might be considered for the design of therapeutic approaches. The immunopathological processes observed in the LCMV and coronavirus system have been attributed to excessive pathogen-directed CD8 T cell responses 18, 27, 29. Likewise, increased mortality after PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade during virulent malaria infection results from increased interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells [30]. During herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and M. tuberculosis infection, impaired PD-1\u2013PD-L1 signaling leads to pathogenic proinflammatory cytokine secretion of CD4 T cells 22, 31. Also, CTLA-4 blockade increases CD4 T cell expansion associated with significantly enhanced mortality during experimental blood-stage malaria [32]. Although most of the above studies have focused on the capacity of T cells to degranulate and produce IFN-\u03b3, elevated levels of the proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 are frequently observed systemically in treated mice 14, 22, 27, 30. Conflicting results have been published on the role of co-inhibitory receptors in the development and function of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. PD-1-deficiency compromises the capacity of Tfh cells to promote germinal center formation after immunization with nitrophenol-chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG), and na\u00efve PD-1 knockout mice exhibit reduced fecal IgA levels due to a skewed Tfh cell cytokine profile in the gut 33, 34. However, PD-L1-deficient mice mount enhanced Tfh cell and humoral responses during Schistosoma mansoni infection, and the simultaneous blockade of PD-L1 and lymphocyte-activation gene (LAG)-3 boosted pathogen-specific Tfh cell and IgG production during P. yoelii infection 35, 36. Although all of these studies shared a positive effect of impaired PD-1\u2013PD-L1 signaling on the total numbers of Tfh cells, they significantly differed with respect to its impact on antibody production.",

Given that PD-1\u2013PD-L1 and PD-1\u2013PD-L2 interaction can exert opposing effects on pathogen-directed immune responses, as seen during Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma cruzi infection 41, 42, blocking of a specific ligand might be preferred to targeting the receptor in order to achieve the desired effect. Likewise, the TNF receptor family member herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) is known to interact with LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxins, inducible expression, competes with HSV glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes), lymphotoxin (LT)\u03b1, CD160 and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Interactions with the two former molecules are described to be co-stimulatory, whereas the two latter interactions are co-inhibitory 43, 44. The interaction of HVEM with LIGHT is pivotal for the clearance of hepatic Leishmania donovani infection [45]. In the same infection model, the binding of LIGHT to a different receptor, LT\u03b2R, inhibits parasite-directed T cell responses during early infection, suggesting opposing roles of LIGHT within one model system due to interactions with distinct molecules.",

In line with this, the simultaneous application of PD-L1 blocking and high-dose agonistic anti-4-1BB antibody during persistent LCMV infection leads to only transiently enhanced virus-directed CD8 T cell responses, after which T cells are overstimulated and driven into apoptosis [49].

It therefore is possible that interfering with co-inhibitory pathways has an impact on peripheral tolerance. Although this remains to be investigated in detail, several studies, mostly from the field of human cancer immunotherapy, provide some insight. Clinical evaluations of CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced-stage melanoma have shown several immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including enterocolitis, as a result of dysregulated intestinal immunity [55]. Additional irAEs documented during CTLA-4 targeting therapies include endocrinopathy, nephritis, hepatitis, and dermatitis [56]. A single dose of PD-1 blocking antibody elicited inflammatory colitis or hypothyroidism in two out of 39 advanced solid tumor patients [57]. Recent data from a trial evaluating the safety and activity of PD-1 blockade in a larger cohort of advanced solid tumor patients have documented adverse events of potential immune-related origin including hypothyroidism, hepatitis, and diabetes mellitus in 39% of treated individuals [58]. A concurrently performed study assessing analogous aspects of PD-L1 blockade in solid tumor patients reproduced some of the above irAEs, while also observing colitis, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, and thyroiditis [59]. Although most of the reported adverse events were categorized as non-severe, they illustrate the potential of temporary pathway blockades to break immunological tolerance.",

Although this has not been investigated in detail, considering the high prevalence of M. tuberculosis superinfection among HIV-positive individuals and the detrimental impact of PD-1-deficiency on disease severity in the M. tuberculosis mouse model, targeting the PD-1\u2013PD-L1 pathway to reinvigorate T cell responses during HIV infection might induce adverse immunopathological events [22]. PD-L1 pathway blockade might also be discontinued in case of influenza virus superinfection, because PD-L1-deficiency can impair influenza virus-specific T cell responses [52]. Recent studies have documented the therapeutic effect of HVEM\u2013CD160 signaling blockade during persistent virus infection, but its requirement for protecting against excessive immunity during pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection also renders a superinfection with latter pathogens during pathway blockades tenuous 69, 70.

In this context, treating local infections should be preferred to systemic diseases, because possible immune-related side effects would be locally confined and easier to compensate or antagonize [72]. Reinvigorating downregulated adaptive immunity during established chronic infections likely bears a lower risk of provoking pathological levels of proinflammatory cytokines or the excessive killing of infected cells than treating during acute infections at the peak of pathogen-directed immune responses due to reduced numbers of antiviral T cells and multiple mechanisms of T cell downregulation, which are present in established chronic viral infections 17, 73, 74, 75. The release of co-inhibition could safely be exploited for boosting antigen-specific T cell responses in the context of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination 76, 77. Furthermore, enhancing pathogen-directed humoral responses might have a lower propensity to elicit immunopathology [36], because most antibody-mediated effector mechanisms do not involve the killing of autologous cells. In cancer, the therapeutic targeting of co-inhibition for boosting antitumor immunity bears a low risk of provoking excessive pathological responses because of relatively small systemic frequencies of tumor-reactive T cells and a confined response to the direct tumor environment. However, precaution should be taken for patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases or acute viral infections, and the risk of long-term treatments to release self-reactive T cells from regulation has to be considered.",
