The purpose of this study was to evaluate causes of pneumonia in a short series of hospitalized travelers returning from abroad and to discuss these etiologies.",

            "text": "The range of etiologies is wider than in other studies, which were biased by the inclusion of febrile patients. In a study of 232 febrile travelers, influenza and bacterial pneumonia represented respectively 20% and 25% of the 56 respiratory admissions, but microbiological documentation was only obtained in 50% of the 14 cases of bacterial pneumonia. 2 In a study of 195 febrile British travelers, pneumonias were diagnosed in eight patients, and comprised four cases of bronchopneumonia, three of pulmonary tuberculosis and one of atypical pneumonia. 3 In a prospective 2-year study of 281 adults living in Kenya for more than 3 months (both travelers and residents), Gram-positive bacteria (mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae) represented 47.4% of identified etiologic agents of pneumonia, followed by Gram-negative bacilli in 7.1% (Salmonella sp. in 2.1%), mycobacteria in 12.5%, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2.5%,and influenza virus in 5%. 5 We observed only one case of Legionnaire's disease, although this is the type of pneumonia most frequently reported in travelers. Interestingly, 23% of cases of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in the US and 45% of cases in the UK involve patients who have made a sea cruise in the 10 days preceding symptom onset. 6, 7 Outbreaks of Legionnaire's disease are frequent after sea cruises. 8 Although the risk of tuberculosis is lower, we observed three cases. This overrepresentation of tuberculosis in our population is explained by the inclusion of two migrants (one HIV-infected, one with a history of primary tuberculosis infection) in whom pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed shortly after their return from their country of origin. The third patient, a woman, was diagnosed with tuberculosis 8 years after a trip to India. She was included in our study because the symptoms started 15 days after her return from a professional trip to Burkina Faso. In a cohort of Dutch travelers, the estimated incidence rate of tuberculosis was 2.8 cases/1,000 personmonths among non-health care workers and 9.8 cases/1,000 personmonths among expatriate health care workers. According to the authors, the risk of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in this cohort of travelers (overall incidence rate \u03ed 3.5 cases/1,000 personmonths) was similar to that of hepatitis A in holidaymakers or of malaria in tourists to Kenya, and was several-fold higher than the incidence rates of most other preventable infections. 9 The risk of acquiring tuberculosis while traveling in a developing country is therefore high. It has thus been suggested that this risk is similar to that for the local population. 9 In addition, the risk of acquiring tuberculosis while traveling near a contagious patient varies according to the means of transportation. Cases of transmission during air travel have been reported, whereas the risk seems to be very low on train and bus journeys. 10, 11 Thus, among 240 travelers exposed to a highly contagious patient during two long journeys in a train (29 h) and in a bus (5.5 h), only four passengers (2%) were shown to have become intradermic tuberculin positive. Two of these four patients had no other risk factors for tuberculin test conversion. 12 We observed one case of Q fever (due to Coxiella burnetti ). Other cases have been reported in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, Syria, the Persian Gulf and French Guyana. 13 We observed one case of dengue fever pneumonia. Dengue fever is frequent in travelers, accounting for 8% of causes of fever in a study of 232 febrile Australian travelers returning home. 2 In contrast, pulmonary manifestations of dengue fever are rare. A few cases of dengue fever associated with pleuropneumonia and hemoptysis revealing pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported. 14 Other potential causes of viral pneumonia include Hantan virus, measles and influenza. Hantan virus is 15 Small outbreaks of influenza have been reported during boat cruises and after air travel. 16 The more recent report described an outbreak occurring on the same boat during three successive cruises to Australia and North America. It probably started during the first cruise, in a group of Australian travelers. Among the 1,284 passengers on board during the second cruise, 215 (17%) described acute respiratory signs, and influenza virus was isolated from some. The boat staff probably comprised the reservoir, and could be a source of transmission to populations at risk, such as elderly people, in enclosed spaces. 17 The incidence of influenza in travelers is probably underestimated. It was recently estimated at 0.03/personmonth of travel in a cohort of 1,483 travelers returning home; in this study, seroconversion for influenza virus infection was demonstrated in 3% of the 1,483 travelers and in 23% of the 205 feverish travelers tested. 18 This diagnosis should therefore be considered in all febrile travelers, keeping in mind that the virus circulates mainly from May to September in the southern hemisphere. The coronavirus pneumonia pandemic has focused attention on travelers returning from endemic areas with fever and respiratory signs, 19 but our study took place before that period of time.",

            "text": "One of our patients probably acquired pulmonary histoplasmosis while visiting a cave in Colombia. Histoplasma capsulatum histoplasmosis is endemic in South and Central America, Africa and eastern Asia. Entry to a basement or cave may lead to a risk of exposure to bat faeces, and short exposure is sufficient for contraction of the disease. Outbreaks have been reported in groups of travelers, especially after underground expeditions, excavations, or simple passage through caves or tunnels housing bats, as recently described among 13 members of a trekking trip to Martinique (French West Indies). 20 Other possible diagnoses in patients returning from the tropics with pulmonary symptoms include fungal infections (Blastomyces dermatitides, Coccidioides immitis, and Paracoccidioidomycosis immitis). 21 Helminthic infections can also cause respiratory symptoms, during the invasive phase of schistosomiasis, Loeffler's syndrome of ascaridiasis, ankylostomiasis and strongyloidiasis, and during the course of trichinosis, gnathostomiasis and toxocariasis. 22 Pulmonary symptoms occurred in 60% of 15 patients with acute schistosomiasis acquired in Mali. 23 In this Dutch cohort, schistosomiasis was mainly due to Schistosoma mansoni. It is noteworthy that the invasive stage of schistosomiasis is more often clinically relevant in patients with Schistosoma japonicum and, to a lesser extent, Schistosoma mansoni infection. 24 Protozoal diseases due to Plasmodium falciparum and Entamoeba histolytica, and infections with Echinococcus granulosus, Dirofilaria immitis or Paragonimus westermanii, are less likely to be complicated by pneumonia. 22 Finally, beside an infectious origin, the possibility of pulmonary embolism must be taken into account in a returning traveler with pulmonary symptoms, even though the importance of the link between thrombosis and air travel is controversial. 25 In conclusion, \"exotic\" causes of pneumonia in travelers are rare in comparison to common communityacquired infections and tuberculosis. Nevertheless, the increase in intercontinental air travel and the emergence of new respiratory diseases such as SARS may alter this situation.",
