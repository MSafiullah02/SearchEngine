One gene encoding for the \u201c\u03b1\u201d subunit (inhibin-\u03b1) and four genes encoding for \u201c\u03b2\u201d subunits (inhibin-\u03b2A, inhibin-\u03b2B, inhibin-\u03b2C, and inhibin-\u03b2E) have been characterized in mammals [13, 16\u201318]. Activins are formed by homo- or hetero-dimerization of inhibin-\u03b2 subunits. So far, the homodimeric \u03b2A/\u03b2A (activin-A) and \u03b2B/\u03b2B (activin-B) and the heterodimeric \u03b2A/\u03b2B (activin-AB) dimers have been purified from biological fluids and their activity assessed, with activin-A receiving the greatest attention till now. Hetero-dimerization of the inhibin-\u03b1 subunit with the inhibin-\u03b2A or -\u03b2B subunits results in the production of the naturally occurring activin antagonists inhibin-A and inhibin-B, respectively (reviewed by de Kretser et al. [10]). The functions of activin-A, activin-B, and activin-AB appear to be very similar; however, the expression pattern of the \u03b2A and \u03b2B subunits differs [19] and mice deficient for either of these subunits exhibit different phenotypes [20, 21] suggesting that these activin forms may perform overlapping functions, without however being fully redundant. Absence of any detectable phenotype in \u03b2C or \u03b2E knockout mice led initially to the conclusion that their function can be compensated [18]. However, subsequent studies demonstrated that the \u03b2C subunit can form homodimers or heterodimers with the \u03b2A or \u03b2B subunits and it was postulated that these forms might compete for receptor occupancy providing thus an antagonistic regulatory mechanism [22, 23]. Consistently, it was shown that recombinant activin-C could antagonize activin-A in vitro and transgenic animals overexpressing inhibin-\u03b2C were found to develop numerous abnormalities in testis, liver, and prostate [24].",

            "text": "TGF-\u03b2 super-family ligands signal via ternary receptor complexes that are formed by two types II and I receptor polypeptides [25]. Both types of receptors possess serine\u2013threonine kinase activity. The type II receptors are constitutively active and thus upon interaction with the ligand come in proximity with the type I receptors, phosphorylate them and activate their kinase activity. Activated type I receptors phosphorylate and activate receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), the intracellular effector molecules of this system. TGF-\u03b2 super-family signaling can be classified into two branches: the TGF-\u03b2 branch, represented by ligands, such as TGF-\u03b2, activin, nodal, or myostatin, which leads to activation of Smad2 and Smad3; and the BMP branch, represented by ligands, such as BMPs and GDFs, which leads to activation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Phosphorylated R-Smads form complexes with the common mediator, Smad4 and enter the nucleus where they bind to DNA and interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression [26]. Finally, the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) Smad6 and Smad7 are induced upon TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligand-mediated signaling and exert a negative feedback effect by competing with R-Smads for receptor interaction and by marking the receptors for degradation [26]. TGF-\u03b2 super-family ligands can also signal via Smad-independent intracellular pathways that involve mitogen-activated protein kinases and are referred to as \u201cnon-canonical\u201d [27].",

The pro-domains guide correct folding and dimerization and contribute to biological activity of mature activins [34\u201336]. The dimeric precursors are proteolytically cleaved and activins are secreted from the cell noncovalently associated with their pro-peptides. Outside the cell, the pro-domain of activin-A can target it to heparin sulfated proteoglycans [37] thus forming gradients around the cells that produce it and also protecting it from proteolytic attack [38]. Interestingly, activin-B lacks the critical residues required for binding to heparin sulfated proteoglycans and may diffuse more easily away from the source of its production, affecting the relative local concentration of mature activin-A and activin-B in a tissue [39]. Whereas TGF-\u03b2 isoforms bind their pro-peptides with very high affinity and therefore are secreted from cells as latent complexes [40], the affinity of the \u03b2A pro-peptide for mature activin-A is very low (Kd 100 nM). Although this affinity can support sequestration of activin-A within tissues, the pro-peptide can be easily displaced by the much higher affinity of the mature peptide to activin type II receptors (Kd 200 pM), and therefore, activin-A is secreted in the extracellular spaces \u201cpractically\u201d in an active form [36].",

Inhibin-A and inhibin-B, sharing the same \u03b2-subunits as activin-A and activin-B are able to compete for the activin receptors acting thus as extracellular regulators of activin signaling [41]. Furthermore, follistatin and follistatin-like protein-3 (FSTL-3) [42\u201344], are synthesized and secreted independently, can bind to activins with high affinity and induce their rapid endocytosis and proteolytic degradation modulating thus the amounts of bioavailable activins in the tissues [45]. Follistatin was initially identified due to its ability to suppress FSH release by the rat pituitary [46], however, it was later demonstrated that this was mediated via blocking activin\u2019s access to its receptors [47].",

            "text": "Two follistatin variants generated through alternative splicing of a primary mRNA have been described, namely, follistatin-288 (FS-288), and follistatin-315 (FS-315) [48]. FS-288 possesses a heparan binding sequence that enables association with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. It normally associates with activins at the cell surface and facilitates their internalization and degradation [49]. However, it can be released into the circulation by heparin [46, 50]. FS-315 on the other hand is the predominant follistatin form in the circulation. It can bind to heparin sulfate only after interaction with activins due to a conformational change that exposes its heparan sulphate binding segment [51, 52]. A third isoform, FST-303 has been identified as a proteolytic by-product of FST-315 [53]. FSTL-3 lacks heparan binding segment and thus behaves like FS-315 [54]. The crystal structures of activin-A in complex with FSTL-3 [55] and FST-288 [56] have been solved. In both these models, two follistatin molecules encircle the activin dimer, such that one quarter of the activin surface is buried. Both forms of follistatin contact two discontinuous surfaces of activin, shielding both the types I and II receptor binding sites [55, 56]. Interestingly, follistatin binds to activin-B with an affinity 10-fold lower that to activin-A [45, 57] indicating a possibility for differential regulation of these two activins. Furthermore, follistatin can inhibit other TGF-\u03b2 ligands such as myostatin and GDF-11 [39] and likewise, FSTL-3 can bind myostatin [58, 59] and some members of the BMP subfamily [39, 43, 60]. Thus, follistatin variants and follistatin-like proteins provide a versatile mechanism for local or systemic regulation of the levels of bioavailable activins and some other members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. Bioavailability of activin-A can be modulated by the action of additional molecules, such as \u03b12-macroglobulin, cerberus, and lipovitelin (reviewed by Philips [14]).",

            "text": "One of the biological processes with which deregulated activin-A expression and function were implicated early on as contributor of pathogenesis, was fibrosis. Hedger et al. demonstrated that activin-A could stimulate mitosis of 3 T3 fibroblasts in vitro [61]. Although, its capacity to stimulate fibroblasts was a fraction of that of TGF-\u03b2, this study provided an early link between activin-A and fibrosis. Expression of activin-A protein was detected by immunofluorescence in bronchiolar epithelium and smooth muscle cells of veins in both control and bleomycin-treated mice and increased activin-A secretion was observed in cultures of alveolar macrophages isolated from bleomycin-treated animals [62]. Although the bleomycin model resembles more acute lung injury (ALI) than bona fide fibrosis, a subsequent report describing increased activin-A immunostaining in metaplastic epithelium, hyperplastic smooth muscle cells, desquamated cells, alveolar macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, admittedly in a very small group of patients with different forms of interstitial lung disease, firmly-associated activin-A with the fibrotic process in the literature [63]. This association was further strengthened by the observations that: (a) activin-A could increase fibroblast migration and their differentiation to myofibroblasts in vitro [64], (b) prophylactic administration of follistatin could ameliorate bleomycin-induced pathology in mice [65], (c) increased levels of activin-A produced by hepatic stellate cells upon carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury were contributing to development of hepatic fibrosis, the severity of which could be diminished by the co-administration of follistatin [66], and (d) the detection of increased serum levels of activin-A, in patients with systemic sclerosis and the demonstration that activin-A could upregulate in vitro collagen production by fibroblasts isolated from patients with systemic sclerosis [67]. Detection of skin abnormalities in animals deficient for either activin-A or follistatin and development of hyper-keratotic skin in the later provided the first evidence pointing towards involvement of the activin-A/follistatin system in skin remodeling [20, 68]. Consistently, substantial increase of activin-A and activin-B expressions was detected after skin injury in mice [69]. In situ hybridization studies revealed different spatiotemporal expression pattern for the two activins, with activin-A being expressed in the granulation tissue below the wound and activin-B in the hyper-proliferative epithelium. While both activins were upregulated during the first 7 days post-injury, after 13 days, activin-A expression was back to baseline levels while activin-B expression persisted [69]. Overexpression of activin-A in the epidermis of transgenic animals under the control of the keratin-14 promoter caused dermal fibrosis, epidermal hyper-thickening, and enhanced wound repair [70]. Conversely, transgenic animals where follistatin was overexpressed using the same promoter as above, had a mild dermal and epidermal atrophy and after injury exhibited a severe delay in wound healing. However, upon healing the wounds presented substantially reduced scar formation [71, 72]. It should be noted that the aforementioned studies constitute the earliest direct demonstration of the detrimental effect of deregulated activin-A expression in vivo. Interestingly, local upregulation of activin-A has been detected by immunohistochemistry during the inflammatory and repair phases that occur in burnt skin as well [73]. Although collectively these reports have implicated activin-A in the processes associated with tissue repair and fibrosis, its actual role in the context of these processes must be quite complex. Activin-A levels were found to be upregulated by several profibrotic agents such as TGF-\u03b21, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), endothelin, interleukin (IL)-13, thrombin, and angiotensin, and conversely activin-A itself was found to be able to stimulate production of pro-fibrotic factors, including TNF-\u03b1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), endothelin, type 1 collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (reviewed by de Kretser et al. [74]).",

            "text": "Activin-A has been implicated in the development of allergic airway inflammatory conditions and thus in the pathophysiology of asthma. Rosendahl et al. [75] using an experimental model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation demonstrated a dramatic increase in the numbers of inflammatory and structural cells expressing nuclear phosphorylated Smad2 within the allergen-challenged lungs that was accompanied by substantial increase in the mRNA levels of inhibin-\u03b2A, inhibin-\u03b2B, inhibin-\u03b2C, inhibin-\u03b2E, and ALK4 (the activin type I receptor) and thus linked for the first time activin-A with respiratory inflammation [75]. The observation that the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) [76] and human mast cells (MC) [77] could produce activin-A upon stimulation with ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA respectively, the co-localization of activin-A with MC in biopsies from human asthmatics, and the defective production of activin-A upon allergen challenge in MC-deficient mice [77] linked activin-A with MC function and suggested that these cells were an important source of activin-A in the inflamed airways. Increased activin-A levels were detected in the serum of patients with severe asthma compared with levels of patients with moderate asthma and healthy control subjects and increased mRNA levels were detected in T cells from patients with moderate asthma. Expression of activin-A by infiltrating lymphocytes and structural cells of the lung was detected in tissue sections from OVA challenged mice [78] or human asthmatic patients by immunohistochemistry [78, 79] and activin-A was found to promote proliferation of human airway smooth muscle cells, and regulate migration and differentiation of bone marrow-derived MC progenitors [80]. Concurrent release of activin-A and follistatin in the lungs of OVA challenged mice with maximal BAL concentrations coinciding with maximal airway eosinophilia and frequency of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 producing cells in mediastinal lymph nodes was reported by Hardy et al. [81]. Immunohistochemical staining pointed towards airway epithelial cells as the source of activin-A and follistatin, and decline of immunostaining for both molecules that paralleled goblet cell metaplasia was interpreted to postulate that these molecules were pre-stored and released upon allergen stimulation [81]. Although upregulation of activin-A in the context of airway inflammation is well documented, conflicting views have been put forward regarding the role of this molecule in asthma pathophysiology based on studies in the mouse OVA allergic airway inflammation model. Hardy et al. [81] observed that neutralization of the allergen-induced activin-A with exogenous follistatin had a beneficial effect [81], however, Semitekolou et al. [82] using the same animal model observed exacerbation of allergen-induced pathology upon neutralization of activin-A using specific antibodies and attenuation of pathology upon treatment of the allergen challenged animals with recombinant activin-A. An interesting twist in the interplay of activin-A with allergic airway inflammation is the resent report demonstrating that activin-A, like TGF-\u03b2, could drive in vitro generation of T(H)9 cells [83]. Importantly, in vivo inhibition of T(H)9 differentiation induced by allergen and reduction of airway hyper-reactivity and collagen deposition could be accomplished only by blocking both activin-A and TGF-\u03b2 [83]. Thus, although activin-A levels are increased during airway inflammatory responses, the actual role of this molecule and consequently it\u2019s potential therapeutic utility for asthma therapy definitely needs further substantiation.",

            "text": "Serendipitously, while studying the effect of castration on the levels of circulating follistatin in rams, Philips et al. [84] observed a robust elevation in the levels of circulating follistatin both in castrated and sum-operated rams. This surprising finding demonstrated that tissues other than the gonads could produce follistatin and also associated upregulation of follistatin levels with the inflammatory response associated with the surgery [84]. This notion was further substantiated by replicating similar follistatin release patterns in sheep injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [85], sheep injected with recombinant IL-1\u03b2 or in lambs subjected to intra-thoracic injection of yeast [52]. A few years later, the development of activin-A-specific immunoassays allowed Jones et al. [86] to monitor activin-A levels in the serum of LPS-injected sheep and demonstrate that activin-A was released within 40 min from LPS injection, slightly earlier than TNF-\u03b1 and significantly earlier than IL-6 [86]. The observation that serum activin-A levels exhibited a biphasic response provided the basis for the hypothesis that the initial release of activin-A was due to pre-stored material released from responding cells, whereas the latter release was due to newly synthesized material [86]. Similar results were obtained in the mouse system where upon LPS injection a rapid initial rise of serum activin-A was followed by a secondary rise 3\u20138 h later [87]. Survival and other pathology-associated parameters in LPS-treated mice improved upon prophylactic administration of follistatin [87] or prophylactic and therapeutic (24-h post-LPS injection) administration of an activin neutralizing fusion protein composed of the extracellular portion of ActRIIB fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 molecule [88]. Detection of increased levels of activin-A in the serum of patients with sepsis [89] and increased activin-A levels in cerebrospinal fluid of rabbits [90] and human patients [91] with bacterial meningitis raised the possibility that activin-A could be a crucial player in the pathophysiology of sepsis.",

Thus, it was shown that human peripheral blood monocytes produce activin-A upon stimulation with LPS [99], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-\u03b3 [100], or TREM-1 [101]. Expression of mRNAs for activin types I and II receptors (ActRI, ActRIB, ActRII, and ActRIIB) and secretion of activin-A by mouse peritoneal macrophages was demonstrated after stimulation with agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4, and 9 [102, 103]. Production of activin-A by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages was demonstrated in an animal model of experimental meningitis induced by inoculation of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the CSN [90]. Human monocyte-derived dentritic cells and CD1c+ and CD123+ peripheral blood dendritic cell (DC) populations were found to express both types I and II activin receptors and secrete high levels of activin-A after exposure to bacteria, specific TLR agonists, or CD40 ligand (CD40L) [104\u2013106]. Interestingly, blood plasmacytoid DC did not synthesize activin-A upon stimulation with influenza virus [105]. Human MC upon stimulation with PMA plus calcium ionophore (A23187) and cultured murine bone marrow MC (BMMC) upon stimulation by cross-linking the IgE receptors were found to produce activin-A as well [77]. Anti-CD3 stimulated CD4posCD25neg T cells, and not CD4posCD25pos regulatory T cells, especially when cultured under Th2 polarizing condition were found to secrete substantial amounts of activin-A in the culture medium, including thus T cells among the putative sources of bioactive activin-A [107]. Finally, activated B cells were also found to express types I and II activin receptors and to secrete activin-A [108].",

            "text": "The studies discussed earlier by Jones et al. in sheep [86] demonstrated that upon LPS administration activin-A levels in the serum increased displaying a biphasic response. The biphasic activin-A response was interpreted as providing to support for the hypothesis that the early response was due to the release of pre-stored activin-A, whereas the second delayed response was due to de-novo synthesis. Activin-A and follistatin were detected by immunohistochemical staining in mouse airways [81]. The reduction of this immunostaining upon challenge of OVA sensitized animals with allergen correlated with increased levels of activin-A and follistatin in the BAL and development of allergic airway inflammation in the airways. These findings were used to further support the notion that preformed activin-A was released in the early stages of an inflammatory response [81]. Analysis of freshly isolated human neutrophils demonstrated that, compared to blood mononuclear cells, they contained 20-fold more activin-A which they could release rapidly upon stimulation with TNF\u03b1, introducing thus neutrophils as an important source of activin-A. The fact that TNF\u03b1 stimulated neutrophils in vitro released activin-A within 1 h although corresponding mRNA levels were not increased until 12 h of culture supported the \u201cpre-stored activin-A\u201d concept [109]. Expression of activin-A by neutrophils and stimulation of its secretion by TNF\u03b1 was also confirmed with murine bone marrow derived neutrophils [110]. Finally, in a comprehensive study, Wu et al. demonstrated that basically all analyzed tissues from untreated or LPS-treated mice contained detectable activin-A and follistatin mRNA and protein [111]. The levels of activin-A in the different tissues analyzed ranged substantially indicating that homeostatic levels of activin-A differ among different tissues. The highest mRNA expression was found in the liver, and the highest concentration of activin-A protein in the bone marrow. Upon LPS treatment, activin-A and follistatin mRNA levels did not change significantly within the first hour after LPS treatment in any of the analyzed tissues, however, a 35 % decrease and a 5-fold increase in activin-A protein level was observed in bone marrow and lung respectively. These changes were associated with migration of bone marrow-derived, activin-A-loaded, neutrophils into the lung parenchyma. Again the authors interpreted these observations as suggesting that the rapid increase in circulating activin-A during LPS-induced inflammation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level, from newly translated and/or stored protein. Interestingly, despite the implication of neutrophils as important activin-A producers, so far little is known regarding the effect of activin-A on the functionality of these cells.",

Thus, activin-A could stimulate the migration of immature murine DCs [112], acting as a pro-inflammatory agent. However, human monocyte derived DCs and CD1c+ peripheral myeloid DCs, when stimulated in vitro with CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the presence of follistatin to block the autocrine action of activin-A, produced higher levels of DC cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (IL-8, IP-10, RANTES, and MCP-1) [104] suggesting thus indirectly a pro-inflammatory effect of activin-A on DCs. Moreover, in the same study, it was shown that neutralization of the DC-derived activin-A significantly enhanced the capacity of DCs pulsed with chemically inactivated whole flu particles to stimulate expansion of viral-antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells in vitro [104]. These findings combined with the demonstration that activin-A could inhibit maturation of DCs [104, 113] and the fact that interaction of T cells with immature DCs could produce an immunosuppressive or tolerogenic response [114], could collectively indicate a potential, activin-A-mediated, autocrine feedback attenuation of DC-mediated responses.",

Thus, It has been shown that activin-A can stimulate monocytes/macrophages to produce inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2, and thromboxanes [115\u2013118], enhance the phagocytic capacity of mouse and rat peritoneal macrophages in vivo and in vitro [115, 117], and promote human monocyte to Langerhans cell (LC) differentiation and migration in vitro [119]. In contrast, other studies demonstrated that activin-A could have anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages that were already activated or in a primed state. Thus, activin-A was shown to attenuate NO release, phagocytic and pinocytic capacity and expression of CD14 and MHC II by LPS activated mouse peritoneal macrophages [120]. Moreover, decreased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and NO as well as IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS mRNA, and reduced expression of CD68, CD14, and TLR4 was observed upon LPS stimulation in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 [121]. Likewise, using activated human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U-937 it was shown that activin-A could inhibit the production of IL-1\u03b2 and enhance at the same time the production of IL-1 receptor antagonist, resulting thus in attenuation of IL-1\u03b2 biological activity [122]. Using the murine microglial cell line MG6 it was shown that activin-A could mitigate its activation by LPS and attenuate upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-18, IL-6 and iNOS [123]. Likewise, using primary rat microglia cell cultures, it was shown that activin-A was able to decrease IFN-\u03b3-induced synthesis of NO and LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, inducible NO synthase, and IL-1\u03b2 [124].",

However, a recent study by Sierra-Filardi et al. demonstrated that activin-A was expressed preferentially by M1 macrophages and more importantly, promoted differentiation of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype [125]. Neutralization of activin-A with specific antibodies in cultures of macrophages that were treated with GM-CSF (conditions that normally lead to M1 polarization) led to reduced expression of M1 markers (CCL17, ECSCR, and CCR2) and increased expression of M2 markers (MAFB, ETS2, FOLR2, IL10, IGF1, and SERPINB2), further supporting the notion that activin-A is an inducer of M1 macrophages [125]. Although the above two studies appear to contradict each other, they might actually present a variation of the same theme, namely, that activin-A affects in different ways na\u00efve and activated or primed cells. The peritoneal macrophages used by Ogawa et al. [107] were murine and were collected after intra-peritoneal injection of thioglycolate, certainly not a resting macrophage population; whereas the macrophage populations analyzed in the study of Sierra-Filardi et al. [125] originated from human peripheral blood monocytes and were polarized using appropriate culture conditions in vitro.",

Early studies demonstrated that recombinant activin-A could inhibit phytohaemaglutinin (PHA)-induced rat thymocyte proliferation in vitro [61]. More importantly, activin-A was shown to enhance in vivo the conversion of mouse peripheral naive T cells to Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) and amplify the capacity of TGF-\u03b21 to promote in vitro development of Foxp3+ Tregs [126]. Induction of another IL-10 producing, however, Foxp3- T regulatory population by activin-A has been described by Semitekolou et al. [82]. Thus, activin-A appears to attenuate T cell responses in two ways, either by inhibiting directly T cell responsiveness or indirectly by promoting the generation of T regulatory cells. Natural killer (NK) cells have also been listed among the inflammatory cells affected by activin-A. Robson et al. [127] demonstrated that NK cells express types I and II activin receptors and that activin-A directly regulates NK cell functions by downregulating expression of the T-box transcription factor T-bet, secretion of IFN-\u03b3, and expression of CD25 [127]. Finally, B lymphocytes have not been exempt from the regulatory influences of activin-A as it has been shown that through direct action on resting B cells, activin-A could enhance IgG and IgE production [108], induce IgA production from mouse mesenteric lymph node cells [128] and decrease proliferation and autoantibody production from B cells of individuals with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [129].",

For example, it has been shown that bovine aortic endothelial cells upon LPS stimulation upregulate activin-A and follistatin mRNA synthesis and protein secretion [130]. Bone marrow-derived stromal fibroblasts were found to produce activin-A, and this was enhanced by IL-1\u03b2 and LPS and inhibited by IFN-\u03b3. Interestingly, the opposite was observed with follistatin secretion, namely, IL-1\u03b2 and LPS exhibiting an inhibitory and IFN-\u03b3 a stimulatory effect on follistatin secretion by the same type of cells [131]. Production of activin-A has also been demonstrated in cultures of synoviocytes and chondrocytes upon stimulation with IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-8 [94], consistent with the detection of high activin-A levels in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Moreover, production of activin-A was demonstrated upon serum stimulation in cultures of quiescent, skin derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and again activin-A production was found further enhanced by IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 [132]. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells have also been described as activin-A producers [66].",

Therefore, to validate directly the consequences of deregulated activin-A expression in vivo, we overexpressed activin-A in the mouse airways using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and meticulously monitored functional and structural alterations in the respiratory system for up to 4 months, the time period post-viral instillation required for the activin-A-induced response to unfold fully [88]. These studies demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of activin-A in mouse airways could cause severe and chronic respiratory pathology, which even four months after virus instillation was not fully resolved. Virus-derived activin-A was detected in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of the experimental animals reaching maximum after seven days, and persisting at increased levels up to day 56. Follistatin mRNA levels were upregulated with a relatively delayed kinetic reaching maximum levels around days 15\u201324 and remaining high until day 35.",

The first stage (days 0\u201315) was characterized by a dramatic and transient wave of cell death, substantial increase in high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) immunostaining, appearance of two waves of inflammatory cells in the BAL (the first consisting primarily of neutrophils and macrophages and the second, more robust wave, of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes), secretion of numerous TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines (with pro-inflammatory cytokines dominating early on and anti-inflammatory cytokines later), development of hyaline membranes, a gradual and eventually dramatic reduction of lung compliance accompanied by decline of surfactant protein-C (SpC), SpB, and SpA expression levels, development of a hyper-coagulant state accompanied by substantial upregulation of tissue factor (TF) mRNA levels and upregulation of CTGF mRNA levels. The second stage (days 15\u201335) was characterized by persistence of HMGB1 immunostaining, dramatic thickening of the alveolar septa and development of honey-comb-like histopathology, upregulation of collagens I and III mRNA levels, and increased deposition of collagen in the tissues. The third and final stage (days 35\u20134 months) was characterized by upregulation of tissue matrix metaloproteases (MMP2 and MMP9), gradual removal of the collage that was deposited earlier and eventual development of emphysematous lesions. Although until stage II, the process appeared to move towards the development of an interstitial fibrosis-like phenotype, during stage III the process shifted completely direction leading eventually to the development of emphysema like pathology. The sequence of events triggered by the ectopic activin-A expression bears striking similarity to the pathophysiology of human acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) [133], and consistently, dramatically increased levels of activin-A were detected in BAL fluids from ARDS patients, strongly supporting the notion that activin-A could play a key role in the pathophysiology of this disorder [88]. The association of activin-A with the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS is consistent with and complementary to earlier studies that have implicated activin-A in the pathophysiology of sepsis [86, 87]. ALI/ARDS and sepsis are distinct disease entities; however, they are intimately related [133\u2013136]. They both represent typical examples of severe pathology triggered by overzealous and inappropriately controlled immune reactivity. ALI/ARDS represent fulminate respiratory conditions in which injury of the lung epithelium and endothelium triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response and leads to often fatal functional and structural deterioration of the lung [136]. Despite the wide variety of recognized precipitating causes such as pneumonia and aspiration of gastric contents, the leading cause of ARDS is severe sepsis [136, 137]. This \u201ccause-effect\u201d relationship could indicate that common harmful effector mechanisms are mobilized during their development, with activin-A being one of them.\n",

            "text": "The histopathology induced by ectopic expression of activin-A in murine lungs shares some features with that induced by overexpression of other molecules such as TGF-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, although it is overall quite unique to activin-A. Whereas the inflammatory response that consist of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, resembles the one induced by IL-1\u03b2 overexpression [138], the histopathology resembles the one described in transgenic animals overexpressing TNF-\u03b1 in the lung [139]. Despite the similarities, however, the TNF-\u03b1-induced phenotype requires considerably longer time to develop compared with the \u223c25 days for the activin-A adenovirus treated animals. Interestingly, the phenotype in the activin-A treated animals is different from the one induced by TGF-\u03b2 overexpression in the lung using either adenovirus in rats or transgene-mediated expression in mice [140, 141]. Both TGF-\u03b2 and activin-A utilize the same Smad proteins and in the genetic background of the C57BL6 mouse they both induce transient waves of cell death, mobilize macrophages, induce Egr-1 and CTGF expression [141, 142], and seem to affect surfactant homeostasis [143] and the coagulation system [144]. However, the final outcome in the case of TGF-\u03b2 overexpression is a more robust fibrotic response whereas in the case of activin-A a transient fibrotic response followed by development of emphysema [88]. Remarkably, the respiratory pathology bearing the highest similarity to the one induced by activin-A overexpression is caused by transient overexpression of gremlin, an inhibitor of BMP-mediated signaling [145]. This surprising finding strongly suggests that basal levels of BMP signaling are part of the mechanism that maintains homeostasis in the adult lung tissue, and thus suppression of basal BMP signaling may cause pathology. Interestingly, treatment of healthy animals by intra-tracheal instillation of a follistatin expressing adenovirus leads to upregulation of SpC and CC10 expression, improvement of lung compliance and extension of tail-bleeding time, strongly suggesting that basal levels of activin-A signaling as well is continuously regulating lung homeostasis (unpublished observation). The development of pathology upon stimulation of the activin-A or suppression of the corresponding BMP signaling pathway, and the improvement of lung function parameters upon suppression of basal activin-A levels by the ectopic expression of follistatin, could indicate that a constant and dynamic balance between basal activities of BMP and activin-A signaling maintains homeostasis in the healthy lung. It appears that these pathways are constantly hardwired in the physiology of the lung and for this reason most likely abrupt changes in their concentration precipitate immediate and robust responses. The presence of activin-A protein and mRNA in all the tissues of healthy animals analyzed by Wu et al. [111] might indicate that activin-A may play a similar role in maintaining homeostasis in other tissues as well.",

            "text": "The earliest change detected in the lungs upon activin-A overexpression was an acute and transient wave of alveolar cell death that reached maximum levels around 48 h post-viral instillation. Interestingly, a similar transient wave of alveolar cell death, with maximum levels again 48 h post transgene activation, has been observed in lung-specific inducible TGF-\u03b2 transgenic animals [141] suggesting that cell death might be a common characteristic of abrupt changes in the levels of TGF-\u03b2 super-family ligands. Importantly, the transient TGF-\u03b2-triggered wave of cell death was crucial since its prevention with different anti-apoptotic reagents could ameliorate development of pathology [141]. Although, apoptotic cells in the TGF-\u03b2 transgenic animals exhibited typical TUNEL+ morphology, the TUNEL+ staining induced by activin-A overexpression involved fragmented cell-debris either attached to basement membranes of alveolar-septa or present in clumps in airspaces, indicating a rapid transition of cells undergoing apoptosis into secondary necrosis and cellular rupture (Fig. 2a). The exact mechanism of activin-A-induced cells death has not been clarified as yet, however, it is very likely that the combination of the acute recruitment of neutrophils in the lung and probably the release of powerful mediators they carry, the activation of the coagulation cascade directly by the effect of activin-A on epithelial cells [88] or indirectly through the activity of neutrophils [146, 147], the suppression of surfactant expression and possibly other responses that have not been analyzed as yet, such as activation of the complement system, could collectively lead to the tissue damage and enhanced cell death (Fig. 2). TLR signaling appears to be a major inducer of activin-A production [74, 87, 102]. Interestingly, high levels of activin-A induce sustained release of HMGB1 (Fig. 2d) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, MCP-1, KC, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-\u03b1 [88]. HMGB1/cytokine complexes that are formed under these conditions are known to activate TLRs [148] establishing thus a feed-forward regulatory loop that can sustain activin-A production as long as the infectious agents or signs of tissue injury persist in the affected tissues (Fig. 3a). This feed-forward loop can be turned on not only by infection but also as a consequence of \u201csterile\u201d disturbance of the homeostatic balance like in the case of sterile tissue injury or other forms of stress [98].\n\n",

            "text": "Correct balance between innate and adaptive immunity is a prerequisite for effective defense against infectious intruders. Although, innate immunity provides a rapid and efficient first line of defense, many of its powerful components do not discriminate between self and non-self and consequently collateral tissue damage is inevitable, especially in the context of prolonged and robust innate responses [149, 150]. Therefore, at the right point, innate responses must be contained and give way to the more sophisticated and specific effector mechanisms of adaptive immunity. Failure to regulate correctly the transition between the innate and adaptive responses can lead to chronic inflammation, a condition associated with numerous inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Upregulation of activin-A expression appears to favor innate immunity in two ways, namely, by acting as a generic amplifier of innate inflammatory responses and by exerting inhibitory effects on adaptive responses. As discussed earlier, activin-A induces in vitro expression of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, and it seems from the studies of Apostolou et al. [88] that either directly or indirectly it can stimulate these activities in vivo as well. Thus, its capacity to upregulate TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and HMGB1 production, and thus establish a feed-forward amplification loop by further activating the TLR pathway might explain the overt activation of innate responses by activin-A. On the other hand, the capacity of activin-A to inhibit maturation of DCs [104, 113], proliferation of T cells, induction of cytotoxic T cells, induction of Foxp3 negative [82] and via a TGF-\u03b2 synergism, Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells [126] illustrates some of the mechanisms by which activin-A could exert its negative effect on adaptive immune function. The dramatically prolonged survival of adenovirus infected cells in animals treated with activin-A expressing adenoviruses [88] may reflect an inhibitory effect on the adaptive mechanisms that normally eliminate virus infected cells. Interestingly, we have observed that lymphopenic RAG-1-deficient animals are much more sensitive to activin-A overexpression than wild-type animals of the same genetic background (unpublished observation). This may indicate that the adaptive system is not just a passive receiver of negative signals from activin-A but rather raises a counter regulatory response in an attempt to tempers the innate activities. Such a dynamic balance between innate and adaptive responses could minimize the risk for collateral damage by an overzealous early innate response [151, 152]. In conclusion, as previously argued [88, 98], activin-A together with follistatin (and other activin inhibitors) occupy a key position in the inter-phase of innate and adaptive immunity. High levels of bioavailable activin-A may intensify innate immunity, whereas, upregulation of follistatin or other activin-A modulating molecules and containment of activin-A reactivity could catalyze a shift towards adaptive-immune and tissue-repair activities.",

            "text": "Like a molecular \u201cSwiss army knife,\u201d activin-A appears to play an important role regulating repair of tissue injury as well. Activation of fibroblasts and modulation of the extracellular matrix turnover either by stimulating collagen mRNA synthesis or affecting the expression of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metaloproteases (TIMPs) [64, 107, 153, 154] are among the tissue repair related activities that can be modulated by activin-A. In the adenovirus-mediated activin-A overexpression in the lung, commencement of tissue-repair-related activities appears to correlate with upregulation of follistatin [88] and is characterized by a decline in cytokine production with high IL-17 mRNA levels being the only remnant of the previous \u201ccytokine storm\u201d response, the appearance of \u201calternatively activated\u201d like macrophages, the upregulation of collagens I and III mRNA levels and transient increase in the collagen deposition in the lung parenchyma. Indeed, alternatively activated macrophages [155], IL-17 [156], and HMGB1, in the absence of other cytokines [148, 157], have been suggested to support tissue repair, and thus the late activation of these processes by activin-A are consistent with the notion that this molecule not only turns on activities that compromise lung functionality, but also coordinates the ensuing necessary remediating activities. Due to the specially delicate architecture of the lung parenchyma clearance of collagen deposits that correlate with a shift in the protease/anti-protease balance in favor of the former may under certain circumstances lead to another form of tissue remodeling, namely development of emphysematous lesions.",

            "text": "Neutrophils constitute the most abundant white blood cell type in circulation and are the first inflammatory cells that are recruited from the circulation into tissues where homeostasis has been compromised either by infection, injury or other forms of stress. They have at their disposal an impressive arsenal of armaments, which, due to their nondiscriminatory nature, can be as hazardous to the host cells as to their intended targets, namely, the microbial intruders. Neutrophils can phagocytize, release the content of their granules in the environment, or utilize a remarkable strategy known as NETosis, an active form of cells death that involves the controlled release of chromatic decorated with antimicrobial granular and cytoplasmic proteins into the extracellular space [158, 159]. Extensive coverage of the biology of these extraordinary cells is beyond the scope of this review. Without any doubt, many of the articles in this issue of \u201cSeminars in Immunopathology\u201d are providing adequate coverage, as numerous reviews in the literature have done previously [160\u2013163]. However, steadily accumulating evidence may imply a special relationship between neutrophils and activin-A, and consequently, this facet of neutrophil biology certainly deserves highlighting herein. Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathophysiology of sepsis, ARDS, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, pre-eclampsia, coronary syndrome, and different forms of tissue injury (reviewed in Refs. [164\u2013168]) and NETosis has been demonstrated in the context of some of these diseases and has been implicated in their pathophysiology. Thus, NETs have been detected in biopsies from human asthmatics that were characterized by infiltration of neutrophils [169], in the lungs of experimental animals that were challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H1N1 [170] or LPS [171] and developed ARDS-like pathology, in the context of transfusion-related acute lung injury in humans and mice [172], and evidence for development of NETs has been produced in systemic lupus erythematosus [173]. Interestingly, the abovementioned disorders are also characterized by upregulated expression of activin-A [133, 134, 174\u2013178] and most probably this correlation is not coincidental. The studies by Chen et al. and Wu et al. [109\u2013111] suggest that this correlation could stem from the fact that neutrophils are major producers of activin-A and consequently diseases characterized by neutrophilia might also exhibit enhanced activin-A production. However, recent observations in our laboratory may indicate that the relationship between neutrophils and activin-A is more complex than that. In the OVA model of allergic airway inflammation, the levels of activin-A in the BAL fluid of the OVA-challenged animals ranges from 1 to 3 ng/ml and the great majority of the inflammatory cells in the BAL are eosinophils (80\u201390 %). We have observed that raising the levels of activin-A in the airways of the OVA-challenged animals using adenoviruses to levels in the BAL \u223c5\u201310 ng/ml could completely shift the eosinophil-dominated airway inflammatory response into a neutrophil-dominated (<1 % eosinophils and 60 % neutrophils) (unpublished observation). Although it is not known for the moment whether this preferential recruitment of neutrophils is caused by a direct action of activin-A on neutrophils or is mediated indirectly via the induction of TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, or any other pro-inflammatory mediator, it is quite clear that a very special, complex and dynamic relationship must link neutrophils and activin-A. Indeed, Kambas et al. have recently demonstrated that neutrophils from patients with sepsis could release large amounts of NET-borne TF that could generate thrombin and activate platelets [179]. Therefore, neutrophils could activate the coagulation cascade indirectly, via an activin-A-mediated stimulation of TF production by epithelial cells [88] and directly by releasing TF-loaded NETs in the tissues [179]. Furthermore, Saffarzadeh et al. have recently demonstrated that NETs can directly induce epithelial and endothelial cell death [171], raising thus the possibility of activin-A-mobilized, neutrophil-derived NETs could contribute to the acute wave of alveolar cell death observed in mice upon intra-tracheal instillation of activin-A-producing adenoviruses. Remarkably, very little is known so far regarding the effect of activin-A signaling in neutrophils. In fact, a search for activin-A and neutrophils in the current literature resulted only in a handful of publications, with a tiny fraction of them directly addressing the consequences of activin-A-mediated signaling on neutrophils function [109]. Thus, tantalizing questions regarding the possible involvement of activin-A in the attraction of neutrophils in a tissue and/or the involvement of activin-A in the modulation of neutrophil functions, such as the formation and release of NETs, remain still unanswered. A more comprehensive scrutiny of the neglected relationship between neutrophils and activin-A is therefore highly warranted.",

            "text": "Activin-A has been known for almost 26 years and still the list of putative functions for this cytokine is steadily growing. The functional repertoire of this remarkable molecule includes numerous and occasionally contradicting pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and tissue remodeling activities. Although there is still a great deal to learn, some features of activin-A biology are becoming better understood and hence a sketchy map that positions activin-A in the context of immuno-inflammatory processes can be drawn (Fig. 3). Thus, it is now recognized that different levels of activin-A mRNA and protein are continuously produced in almost any normal tissue analyzed [111]. These \u201cbasal\u201d activin-A levels of production/activity are most likely important for the fine tuning of essential homeostatic functions. Abrupt changes in the levels of bioavailable activin-A in a tissue rapidly activate a number of biological responses which, although they are meant to be protective, if not managed properly, they can cause severe tissue injury and pave the way to pathology (Fig. 3). The potentially tissue-damaging responses triggered by activin-A include among others exuberant activation of the innate immune system, with neutrophils and macrophages being among the first to be recruited in tissues upon increase in activin-A expression, activation of the coagulation system that could lead to disseminated micro-vascular thrombosis, and in the respiratory system dramatic reduction of surfactant biosynthesis. The rationale behind the trade-off between protection and collateral tissue damage has been very eloquently discussed in review articles in the literature [149, 150]. One can envisage situations where the crisis is so critical that a robust innate response that will restrict the spread of the intruder by activating the coagulation and complement systems and recruiting a robust neutrophil response could provide an effective protection, although at the cost of collateral tissue damage. It seems that activin-A does not function only during the acute phase of an inflammatory response, but as the response unfolds it may function as a coordinator of innate and adaptive immune responses, amplifying the former and suppressing directly or indirectly through induction of regulatory T cells the later. Consequently, aberrant activin-A function in this context can lead to improper balance between innate and adaptive responses with potentially detrimental consequences. Finally, activin-A regulates activities that are related to remediation of the tissue injury caused either by infection or by collateral damage inflicted by an overzealous or protracted activation of the immune system. Thus, it has become evident that activin-A plays key roles at the interface of homeostasis, innate and adaptive immunity and tissue repair (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Although the rich functional repertoire of activin-A might appear confusing at a first glance, it becomes more palpable if we recognize that the different and occasionally counteracting activities that have been described by in vitro studies for activin-A, constitute in vivo integral components of a dynamic continuum in which the time factor is of key importance. It is very clear that as an inflammatory response unfolds, both the cells and the microenvironment involved evolve continuously (Fig. 3). The tissue resident and the recruited inflammatory cells go through different stages of activation, express new receptors and co-receptors and often desensitize some, and different cytokines are produced at each stage from the onset till the eventual resolution of the response [88, 149, 150]. Consequently, in vivo, activin-A signaling targets \u201cdifferent\u201d cells in the context of \u201cdifferent\u201d microenvironments as the response unfolds time-wise. Thus, pro-inflammatory activities of activin-A predominate during the acute, early phase of the response targeting primarily na\u00efve cells, whereas, anti-inflammatory and matrix remodeling activities are manifested later in the response and target primed and activated cells. It is very likely that early and late activin-A-induced responses are linked with a \u201ccause\u2013effect\u201d relationship, interlink in the fabric of a master homeostasis restitution program. As mentioned earlier, similar cause\u2013effect relationship has been described between the transient apoptotic response induced by ectopic overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 in the lung and the fibrotic response that followed much later [141].",

The therapeutic action of activin-A neutralizers, such as follistatin or a fusion protein composed of the extracellular potion of ActRIIB, the type II receptor for activins, linked to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 antibody, in colitis animal models [92] and in the exogenous activin-A or LPS-driven ALI/ARDS animal models [88] clearly indicate that even after establishment of pathology, neutralization of activin-A can still attenuate pathology associated parameters. This raises expectations for the clinical application of activin-A inhibitors and highlight the need for further research to further unwind the principles that govern and modulate its in vivo actions. Likewise, the intimate relation between neutrophil biology and activin signaling that is slowly emerging necessitates a more thorough investigation. Given their direct involvement in safeguarding and remediating homeostasis, such a relationship is most likely anything but coincidental.",
